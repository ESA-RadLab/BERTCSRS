42,"Head and neck radiotherapy does not increase gelatinase (metalloproteinase-2 and -9) expression or activity in teeth irradiated in vivo. OBJECTIVE: Recent studies suggested that head and neck radiotherapy increases active forms of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) in the dentin-enamel junction (DEJ), leading to enamel delamination and radiation-related caries. This study aimed to assess the expression and activity of the gelatinases MMP-2 and MMP-9 in the DEJ and dentin-pulp complex tissues of teeth irradiated in vivo., STUDY DESIGN: Thirty-six teeth were studied, including 19 irradiated and 17 non-irradiated controls. In situ zymography was used to investigate the gelatinolytic activity in the micromorphologic components of enamel, DEJ, dentin-pulp complex, and caries. Immunohistochemical analysis was conducted on the demineralized samples to assess MMP-2 and MMP-9 expression levels in the DEJ, dentin-pulp complex components, and caries., RESULTS: No statistically significant differences were detected between groups in gelatinolytic activity or in MMP-2 expression levels (P > .05). Odontoblast MMP-9 expression was reduced in the irradiated group (P = .02)., CONCLUSIONS: The study rejected the hypothesis that MMP-2 and MMP-9 would be overexpressed or more activated in the DEJ and dentin-pulp complex of irradiated teeth. Direct effects of radiation should not be regarded as an independent factor for explaining radiation-related caries onset and progression. Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Inc.

Effects of ten day long exposure to gamma-irradiation at low doses (mean dose rate of 1.5-2.0 m Gy/day, total dose of 15 m Gy) on hemopoietic (CFU-S) and stromal (CFU-F) progenitor cells from murine bone marrow were examined. The CFU-F content measured as in vitro fibroblastic colony number showed 1.5-4.5-fold increase. Additionally, the size of ectopic marrow transplants evaluated by counting myelokariocytes and CFU-S numbers also increased. No significant changes of CFU-S proliferation rate were found.",Included
65,Role of the direct action of radiation in the mechanism of development of mammary gland tumors. The role of the direct action of radiation in the genesis of mammary gland tumors in animals of both sexes was studied in experiments on noninbred albino rats. In two series of experiments the anterior or posterior half of the rat's body was irradiated with X rays in doses of 200 to 1000 rad. Tumors of the mammary glands appeared considerably earlier and were more numerous in the irradiated parts of the body of both females and males than in the unirradiated glands or in control animals. Females developed mammary gland tumors after exposure to smaller doses and in a higher proportion of cases than males.,Included

90,"Effect of X-irradiation on epidermal immune function: decreased density and alloantigen-presenting capacity of Ia+ Langerhans cells and impaired production of epidermal cell-derived thymocyte activating factor (ETAF). The mechanisms involved in the modulation of cutaneous immune responses by UV radiation have been extensively investigated; by contrast, few studies have addressed the effects of x-irradiation on epidermal immune function. We therefore investigated the effect of x-irradiation of mice on: (a) the density of epidermal Ia+ Langerhans cells (LC) in immunofluorescence studies, (b) epidermal cell (EC) allostimulatory capacity in the allogeneic EC-lymphocyte reaction (ELR), and (c) production of epidermal cell-derived thymocyte activating factor (ETAF). C3H/He and BALB/c mice were irradiated with 900, 1,800, 2,700, or 3,600 rad from a 137Cs source, and sacrificed 10 h or 3 days later. X-irradiation of mice 10 h previously only slightly decreased the density of epidermal Ia+ LC and did not affect the capacity of their EC to stimulate allogeneic responder lymphocytes in the ELR. X-irradiation of mice 3 days previously, however, resulted in a dose-dependent decrease in the density of Ia+ LC. This decrease was accompanied by a substantial reduction in EC allostimulatory capacity in the ELR at all doses of x-irradiation. ETAF production by cultured EC from mice x-irradiated 3 days previously was also found to be diminished at all doses of x-irradiation. Trypan blue exclusion studies demonstrated that the observed decreases in EC allostimulatory capacity and ETAF production were not the result of a generalized lethal effect of x-irradiation on EC. The reduction in EC allostimulatory capacity following in vivo x-irradiation could not be reversed by addition of exogenous ETAF or interleukin-1 in the ELR. Taken together, these results indicate that x-irradiation decreases the density of Ia+ LC, impairs LC alloantigen-presenting function, and reduces ETAF production. Thus cutaneous x-irradiation may affect inflammatory and neoplastic processes not only by its antimitotic activity, but also by a direct effect on EC which subserve immunologic functions.",Included

The dynamics of cell-mediated immunity indices in 83 patients with rectal tumors who underwent surgery or received combined treatment (preoperative radiation + surgery) was followed. Cellular immunity was assessed on the basis of PHA-induced blastogenic reaction of lymphocytes (BRL) and spontaneous rosette-formation. In rectal tumor patients, particularly at stage IV, the level of PHA-induced BRL and the total number of rosette-forming cells (RFC) were lower than in healthy donors. Surgery did not produce any significant changes in cell-mediated immunity parameters: level of PHA-induced BRL decreased by 16,7%, while total RFC number increased by 17.2% in (mostly low-affinity forms). Preoperative radiation resulted in a significant decrease in lymphocyte ability to undergo PHA-induced blast-transformation (45%) and spontaneous rosette formation, high-affinity lymphocytes being most sensitive to ionizing radiation. Their fraction decreased by half.",Included

205,"Sex and tissue-specific differences in low-dose radiation-induced oncogenic signaling. PURPOSE: The possible adverse health effects of low-dose radiation (LDR) exposure constitute a growing concern. Clinically and environmentally relevant exposures occur predominantly under chronic conditions, notwithstanding that most studies of LDR effects have been performed using a single acute exposure. Sex- and tissue-specificity of the LDR-induced changes have not been considered before. We investigated LDR-related expression patterns in muscle, liver and spleen of male and female mice subjected to acute and chronic LDR exposure. Genes involved in oncogenic signaling were of specific interest, as radiation is a well-known carcinogen., MATERIALS AND METHODS: We analyzed the expression pattern of genes coding for growth factors and growth-factor receptors, cytoplasmic serine/threonine protein kinases, G-proteins and nuclear DNA-binding proteins, and other important components of oncogenic signaling., RESULTS: We found sex- and tissue-specific changes in the expression of Ras superfamily members (Nras, Rab2, Rab34, Vav2), protein kinase C (PKC) isoforms (PKCbeta, PKCmu), AP-1 factor components (Jun, JunB and FosB), Wnt signaling pathway members as well as in a variety of other cellular proto-oncogenes and oncogenes. Importantly, Western blot analysis of JunB, PKCmu and Rab2 proteins supported the transcriptomic data., CONCLUSIONS: Substantially different protein levels were observed in all three tissues (muscle, spleen and liver) of acutely and chronically irradiated female and male animals. Based on the obtained data and available literature, we discuss several possible mechanisms that may contribute to radiation-induced carcinogenesis in various tissues of males and females. From our results we could identify the genes that may serve as sex- and tissue-specific biomarkers of the LDR exposure.",Included
218,"Identification of ERp29 as a biomarker for predicting nasopharyngeal carcinoma response to radiotherapy. Radioresistance continues to be a major problem in the treatment of nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC). This study aimed to identify novel proteins associated with NPC radio-resistance. We used a mass spectrometry driven-proteomic strategy to identify novel proteins associated with NPC radio-resistance, and differential proteins were subsequently processed by bio-informatic analysis. As a result, twelve proteins were identified with aberrant expression in radioresistant (RR) NPC tissues compare to radiosensitive (RS) NPC tissues. Among these proteins, ERp29, Mn-SOD, HSP27 and GST omega1 were found to be significantly up-regulated in RR NPC tissues, and ERp29 was selected for further validation. Immunohistochemistry analysis confirmed that ERp29 was overexpressed in RR NPC tissues compared with RS NPC tissues. To prove the role of ERp29 in the induction of NPC radioresistance, ERp29 was down-regulated in the ERp29 enriched NPC cells CNE-1 and 6-10B by specific shRNA. Radiosensitivity was measured using cell proliferation assay and clonogenic survival assay, and cell apoptosis was measured using flow cytometric analysis. We found that ERp29 knockdown attenuated CNE-1 and 6-10B cell radioresistance and enhanced cell apoptosis. These results suggest that ERp29 associates with radioresistance in NPC, and ERp29 could be a potential biomarker for predicting NPC response to radiotherapy.",Included
220,"Gamma-radiation sensitivity and risk of glioma. BACKGROUND: About 9% of human cancers are brain tumors, of which 90% are gliomas. gamma-Radiation has been identified as a risk factor for brain tumors. In a previous pilot study, we found that lymphocytes from patients with glioma were more sensitive to gamma-radiation than were lymphocytes from matched control subjects. In this larger case-control study, we compared the gamma-radiation sensitivity of lymphocytes from glioma patients with those from control subjects and investigated the association between mutagen sensitivity and the risk for developing glioma., METHODS: We used a mutagen sensitivity assay (an indirect measure of DNA repair activity) to assess chromosomal damage. We gamma-irradiated (1.5 Gy) short-term lymphocyte cultures from 219 case patients with glioma and from 238 healthy control subjects frequency matched by age and sex. After irradiation, cells were cultured for 4 hours, and then Colcemid was added for 1 hour to arrest cells in mitosis. Fifty metaphases were randomly selected for each sample and scored for chromatid breaks. All statistical tests were two-sided., RESULTS: We observed a statistically significantly higher frequency of chromatid breaks per cell from case patients with glioma (mean = 0.55; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.50 to 0.59) than from control subjects (mean = 0.44; 95% CI = 0.41 to 0.48) (P<.001). Using 0.40 (the median number of chromatid breaks per cell in control subjects) as the cut point for defining mutagen sensitivity and adjusting for age, sex, and smoking status, we found that mutagen sensitivity was statistically significantly associated with an increased risk for glioma (odds ratio = 2.09; 95% CI = 1.43 to 3.06). When the data were divided into tertiles, the relative risk for glioma increased from the lowest tertile to the highest tertile (trend test, P<.001)., CONCLUSION: gamma-Radiation-induced mutagen sensitivity of lymphocytes may be associated with an increased risk for glioma, a result that supports our earlier preliminary findings.",Included

222,"Different patterns of allelic imbalance in sporadic tumors and tumors associated with long-term exposure to gamma-radiation. The study aimed to reveal cancer related mutations in DNA repair and cell cycle genes associated with chronic occupational exposure to gamma-radiation in personnel of the Siberian Group of Chemical Enterprises (SGCE). Mutations were analyzed by comparing genotypes of malignant tumors and matched normal tissues of 255 cancer patients including 98 exposed to external gamma-radiation (mean dose 128.1+/-150.5mSv). Also a genetic association analysis was carried out in a sample of 149 cancer patients and 908 healthy controls occupationally exposed to gamma-radiation (153.2+/-204.6mSv and 150.5+/-211.2mSv, respectively). Eight SNPs of genes of DNA excision repair were genotyped (rs13181, rs1052133, rs1042522, rs2305427, rs4244285, rs1045642, rs1805419 and rs1801133). The mutation profiles in heterozygous loci for selected SNP were different between sporadic tumors and tumors in patients exposed to radiation. In sporadic tumors, heterozygous genotype Arg/Pro of the rs1042522 SNP mutated into Arg/0 in 15 cases (9.6%) and 0/Pro in 14 cases (8.9%). The genotype Lys/Gln of the rs13181 SNP mutated into Lys/0 and 0/Gln in 9 and 4 cases, respectively. In tumors of patients exposed to low-level radiation, the rs1042522 Arg/0 mutated genotype was found in 12 cases (12.1%), while in 2 cases (2%) 0/Pro mutation was observed. Finally, the rs13181 0/Gln mutated genotype was observed in 15 cases (16,5%) . Thus, our study showed the difference in patterns of allelic imbalance in tumors appeared under low-level radiation exposure and spontaneous tumors for selected SNPs. This suggests different mechanisms of inactivation of heterozygous genotypes in sporadic and radiation-induced tumors. Copyright © 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",Included
226,"Estimation of dose in cancer patients treated with fractionated radiotherapy using translocation, dicentrics and micronuclei frequency in peripheral blood lymphocytes. The frequency of translocation, dicentrics (DC) and micronuclei (MN) was studied in blood samples exposed in vitro to 60Co gamma radiation and cervical cancer patients undergoing fractionated radiotherapy. The samples exposed under in vitro condition showed that the frequency of translocation and dicentric followed Poisson distribution ('u' varied between -0.04 and +1.41 for translocation and between -0.09 and +1.81 for DC) and that obtained with MN follow over dispersion ('u' varied between +2.04 and +9.28). However, the cervical cancer patients undergoing radiotherapy showed over dispersion for all these three aberrations (DC, MN and translocation). The frequencies of aberrations obtained in cancer patients were found to be lower than those obtained for in vitro exposure for doses more than 2 Gy equivalent whole body dose (EWBD). The dose-response curves were constructed using the frequencies of DC, MN and translocation as a function of EWBD. Doses as measured from the dose response curves were compared with the estimated dose in order to check whether the measured and estimated doses agree. The percent variation between the doses measured from aberration frequencies and that of the estimated dose was lower with translocation (10.8+/-7.41%) compared to those obtained with DC (38.08+/-31.85%) and MN (47.19+/-31.80%).

241,"Deficiency in PER proteins has no effect on the rate of spontaneous and radiation-induced carcinogenesis. There is a growing body of evidence that components of the circadian clock are involved in modulation of numerous signaling pathways, and that clock deregulation due to environmental or genetic factors contributes to the development of various pathologies, including cancer. Previous work performed in tissue culture and in in vivo mouse models defined mammalian PERIOD proteins as tumor suppressors, although some experimental inconsistencies (the use of mice on mixed genetic background, lack of sexual discrimination) did not allow a definitive conclusion. To address this issue in a systematic way, we performed a detailed analysis comparing the incidence of tumor development after low-dose ionizing radiation in male and female wild-type, Per1-/-, and Per2-/- mice. We showed that in contrast to previous reports deficiency in either Per1 or Per2 genes by itself does not make mice more tumor-prone; moreover, some of the long-term effects of ionizing radiation in Per2-deficient mice are reminiscent more of accelerated aging rather than tumor-prone phenotype. Our histopathological analysis also revealed significant sexual dimorphism both in the rate of radiation-induced tumorigenesis and in the spectrum of tumors developed, which underscores the importance of using sex-matched experimental groups for in vivo studies. Based on our results, we suggest that the role of PER proteins as bone fide tumor suppressors needs to be reevaluated. © 2013 Landes Bioscience.",Included
251,"Irradiation of adult human dental pulp stem cells provokes activation of p53, cell cycle arrest, and senescence but not apoptosis. Adult human dental pulp contains stem cells (DPSCs) that are capable of differentiation into osteoblasts, odontoblasts, adipocytes, and neuronal-like cells. Because these cells have potential use in tissue regeneration, herein we characterized the response of DPSC lines to ionizing radiation (IR). These DPSC lines have been developed from the extracted molars of healthy donors. DPSCs were cultivated in a unique media supplemented with epidermal growth factor (EGF) and platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF). Since tissue homeostasis depends on a precise balance among cell proliferation, senescence, and cell death, we explored the effects of IR (2-20 Gy) on the proliferative activity of DPSCs and the molecular pathways involved. Even the highest dose used (20 Gy) did not induce DPSC apoptosis. After irradiation with doses of 6 and 20 Gy, DPSCs accumulated in the G2 phase of the cell cycle. DPSCs responded to IR (20 Gy) with senescence detected as SA-beta-galactosidase positivity, beginning on the third day after irradiation. Twenty-four hours after irradiation, p53 and its serine 15 and 392 phosphorylated forms were detected. At this time, p21 (WAF1) was induced. Increases in protein p16 were observed from the third day following irradiation and continued till the end of the examination (Day 13). We conclude that DPSCs respond to IR-induced damage by permanent cell cycle arrest in the G2 phase and by stress-induced premature senescence. © 2010, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.",Included
256,"Lung cancer mortality associated with protracted low-dose occupational radiation exposures and smoking behaviors in U.S. radiologic technologists, 1983-2012. In the Japanese atomic bomb survivors, risk of lung cancer has been shown to increase with greater acute exposure to ionizing radiation. Although similar findings have been observed in populations exposed to low-dose, protracted radiation, such studies lack information on cigarette smoking history, a potential confounder. In a cohort of 106 068 U.S. radiologic technologists, we examined the association between estimated cumulative lung absorbed dose from occupational radiation exposure and lung cancer mortality. Poisson regression models, adjusted for attained age, sex, birth cohort, pack-years smoked and years since quitting smoking, were used to calculate linear excess relative risks (ERR) per 100 mGy, using time-dependent cumulative lung absorbed dose, lagged 10 years. Mean cumulative absorbed dose to the lung was 25 mGy (range: 0-810 mGy). During the 1983 to 2012 follow-up, 1090 participants died from lung cancer. Greater occupational radiation lung dose was not associated with lung cancer mortality overall (ERR per 100 mGy: -0.02, 95% CI: <0-0.13). However, significant dose-response relationships were observed for some subgroups, which might be false-positive results given the number of statistical tests performed. As observed in other studies of radiation and smoking, the interaction between radiation and smoking appeared to be sub-multiplicative with an ERR per 100 mGy of 0.41 (95% CI: 0.01-1.15) for those who smoked <20 pack-years and -0.03 (95% CI: <0-0.15) for those who smoked >=20 pack-years. Our study provides some evidence that greater protracted radiation exposure in the low-dose range is positively associated with lung cancer mortality.Copyright © 2020 UICC",Included
262,"Protection of radiation-induced damage to the hematopoietic system, small intestine and salivary glands in rats by JNJ7777120 compound, a histamine H4 ligand. Based on previous data on the histamine radioprotective effect on highly radiosensitive tissues, in the present work we aimed at investigating the radioprotective potential of the H4R ligand, JNJ7777120, on ionizing radiation-induced injury and genotoxic damage in small intestine, salivary glands and hematopoietic tissue. For that purpose, rats were divided into 4 groups. JNJ7777120 and JNJ7777120-irradiated groups received a daily subcutaneous JNJ7777120 injection (10 mg/kg) starting 24 h before irradiation. Irradiated groups received a single dose of 5 Gy on whole-body using Cesium-137 source and were sacrificed 3 or 30 days after irradiation. Tissues were removed, fixed, stained with hematoxylin and eosin or PAS staining and histological characteristics were evaluated. Proliferative and apoptotic markers were studied by immunohistochemistry, while micronucleus assay was performed to evaluate DNA damage. Submandibular gland (SMG) function was evaluated by methacholine-induced salivation. Results indicate that JNJ7777120 treatment diminished mucosal atrophy and preserved villi and the number of crypts after radiation exposure (240+/-8 vs. 165+/-10, P<0.01). This effect was associated to a reduced apoptosis and DNA damage in intestinal crypts. JNJ7777120 reduced radiation-induced aplasia, preserving medullar components and reducing formation of micronucleus and also it accelerated bone marrow repopulation. Furthermore, it reduced micronucleus frequency in peripheral blood (27+/-8 vs. 149+/-22, in 1,000 erythrocytes, P<0.01). JNJ7777120 completely reversed radiation-induced reduced salivation, conserving glandular mass with normal histological appearance and reducing apoptosis and atrophy of SMG. JNJ7777120 exhibits radioprotective effects against radiation-induced cytotoxic and genotoxic damages in small intestine, SMG and hematopoietic tissues and, thus, could be of clinical value for patients undergoing radiotherapy.",Included

301,"Cell Salvage During Liver Transplantation for Hepatocellular Carcinoma: A Retrospective Analysis of Tumor Recurrence Following Irradiation of the Salvaged Blood. BACKGROUND: Orthotopic liver transplantation (OLT) is the treatment option for early-stage hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). OLT is often associated with high blood loss, requiring blood transfusion. Retransfusion of autologous blood is a key part of blood conservation. There are, however, concerns that the retransfusion of salvaged blood might cause the spread of cancer cells and induce metastasis. Irradiation of salvaged blood before retransfusion eliminates viable cancer cells. Here, we analyzed the incidence of tumor recurrence in patients with HCC undergoing OLT who received irradiated cell-salvaged blood during transplant surgery., METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed patients undergoing OLT for HCC between 2002 and 2018 at our center. We compared the tumour recurrence in patients who received no retransfusion of autologous blood with patients who received autologous blood with or without preceding irradiation of the blood., RESULTS: Fifty-one (40 male, 11 female) patients were included in the analysis; 10 patients developed tumor recurrence within a time period of 2.45 +/- 2.0 years. Statistical analysis revealed that there was no significant difference in tumor recurrence between patients who received autologous blood with or without irradiation., CONCLUSION: Intraoperative transfusion of cell-salvaged blood did not increase tumor recurrence rates. Cell salvage should be used in liver transplantation of HCC patients as part of a blood conservation strategy. The effect of blood irradiation on tumor recurrence could not be definitively evaluated.

314,"Curvature in the cancer mortality dose response in Japanese atomic bomb survivors: absence of evidence of threshold. PURPOSES: To investigate the evidence for a threshold in the cancer dose-response curve., MATERIALS AND METHODS: Japanese atomic bomb survivor cancer mortality data, based on follow-up to 1990, was used, taking account of random errors in DS86 dose estimates., RESULTS: For all solid cancers analysed together, there is a significant positive dose response (two-sided p<0.05) if all survivors who received <0.5 Sv are considered, but the significance vanishes if doses of <0.2 Sv are considered; the same is also true for leukaemia. For solid cancer mortality there is no indication of curvilinearity in the dose response: no statistically significant improvement in fit to a linear relative risk model is provided by addition of quadratic or threshold dose terms. If a relative risk model with a threshold (the dose response is assumed linear above the threshold) is fitted to solid cancer mortality data, the best estimate of the threshold is < 0.00 Sv (95% CI <0.00-0.13). If a linear-quadratic-threshold model is used the best estimate of the threshold is < 0.00 Sv (95% CI < 0.00-0.15). For leukaemia mortality there is highly statistically significant upward curvature in the dose response. In particular, if a relative risk model with a threshold (the dose response is assumed linear above the threshold) is fitted to the leukaemia data, the best estimate of the threshold is 0.16 Sv (95% CI 0.05-0.40) (two-sided p=0.001 for test of departure of threshold from 0). However, there is no evidence for a threshold effect (two-sided p = 0.16) when a quadratic term is included in the dose response: the best estimate of threshold in this case is 0.09Sv (95% CI <0.00-0.29). Moreover, addition of a quadratic term improves the fit of a linear-threshold model at borderline levels of statistical significance (two-sided p = 0.07). Therefore, the most parsimonious description of the leukaemia dose response is provided by a linear-quadratic function of dose., CONCLUSIONS: There is no evidence of threshold-type departures from the linear-quadratic dose response either for solid tumours or for leukaemia in the Japanese atomic bomb survivor mortality data.",Included

324,"Generation of a Transcriptional Radiation Exposure Signature in Human Blood Using Long-Read Nanopore Sequencing. In the event of a large-scale event leading to acute ionizing radiation exposure, high-throughput methods would be required to assess individual dose estimates for triage purposes. Blood-based gene expression is a broad source of biomarkers of radiation exposure which have great potential for providing rapid dose estimates for a large population. Time is a crucial component in radiological emergencies and the shipment of blood samples to relevant laboratories presents a concern. In this study, we performed nanopore sequencing analysis to determine if the technology can be used to detect radiation-inducible genes in human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). The technology offers not only long-read sequencing but also a portable device which can overcome issues involving sample shipment, and provide faster results. For this goal, blood from nine healthy volunteers was 2 Gy ex vivo X irradiated. After PBMC isolation, irradiated samples were incubated along with the controls for 24 h at 37degreeC. RNA was extracted, poly(A)+ enriched and reverse-transcribed before sequencing. The data generated was analyzed using a Snakemake pipeline modified to handle paired samples. The sequencing analysis identified a radiation signature consisting of 46 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) which included 41 protein-coding genes, a long non-coding RNA and four pseudogenes, five of which have been identified as radiation-responsive transcripts for the first time. The genes in which transcriptional expression is most significantly modified after radiation exposure were APOBEC3H and FDXR, presenting a 25-and 28-fold change on average, respectively. These levels of transcriptional response were comparable to results we obtained by quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) analysis. In vivo exposure analyses showed a transcriptional radioresponse at 24 h postirradiation for both genes together with a strong dose-dependent response in blood irradiated ex vivo. Finally, extrapolating from the data we obtained, the minimum sequencing time required to detect an irradiated sample using APOBEC3H transcripts would be less than 3 min for a total of 50,000 reads. Future improvements, in sample processing and bioinformatic pipeline for specific radiation-responsive transcript identification, will allow the provision of a portable, rapid, real-time biodosimetry platform based on this new sequencing technology. In summary, our data show that nanopore sequencing can identify radiation-responsive genes and can also be used for identification of new transcripts.Copyright © 2020 by Radiation Research Society.

To gain insight into the molecular mechanisms that underlie radiation-associated meningioma (RAM), we characterized the somatic genetic alterations in 16 RAMs by using comparative genomic hybridization and compared the pattern of alterations with 17 nonradiation-associated meningiomas (non-RAM). Most tumors (29/33;87.9%) displayed at least one DNA copy number alteration, and 11 out of 33 (33%) exhibited four or more changes. The mean number of DNA copy number changes was similar in RAMs (2.4+/-1.9) and in non-RAMs (2.5+/-1.9). The most common DNA losses were noted in chromosome 22 (56.2% in RAM, and 47% in non-RAM) and chromosome 1 (37.5% in RAM and 35.3% in non-RAM), with no significant differences between the two groups. Noteworthy, gain in DNA copy number of chromosomes 8 and 12 was detected in two RAM tumors only. In conclusion, no significant differences were noted between RAMs and non-RAMs regarding the number of genetic changes and the extent and frequency of chromosomes 1 and 22 losses. These preliminary data suggest that the tumorogenic pathways of meningioma formation are similar, regardless of previous skull irradiation.",Included

This chapter summarises the results of the preceding sections, which estimate the fraction of cancers occurring in the UK in 2010 that can be attributed to sub-optimal, past exposures of 14 lifestyle and environmental risk factors. For each of 18 cancer types, we present the percentage of cases attributable to one or all of the risk factors considered (tobacco, alcohol, four elements of diet (consumption of meat, fruit and vegetables, fibre, and salt), overweight, lack of physical exercise, occupation, infections, radiation (ionising and solar), use of hormones, and reproductive history (breast feeding)).Exposure to less than optimum levels of the 14 factors was responsible for 42.7% of cancers in the UK in 2010 (45.3% in men, 40.1% in women)-a total of about 134 000 cases.Tobacco smoking is by far the most important risk factor for cancer in the UK, responsible for 60 000 cases (19.4% of all new cancer cases) in 2010. The relative importance of other exposures differs by sex. In men, deficient intake of fruits and vegetables (6.1%), occupational exposures (4.9%) and alcohol consumption (4.6%) are next in importance, while in women, it is overweight and obesity (because of the effect on breast cancer)-responsible for 6.9% of cancers, followed by infectious agents (3.7%).Population- attributable fractions provide a valuable quantitative appraisal of the impact of different factors in cancer causation, and are thus helpful in prioritising cancer control strategies. However, quantifying the likely impact of preventive interventions requires rather complex scenario modelling, including specification of realistically achievable population distributions of risk factors, and the timescale of change, as well as the latent periods between exposure and outcome, and the rate of change following modification in exposure level. © 2011 Cancer Research UK All rights reserved.",Included
369,"Asesment of lymphoid neoplasm risk factors in people ocupationaly exposed to prolonged ionizing radiation. Objective: To estimate the incidence of malignant neoplasms of lymphoid tissue (MNLT) among employees of the Siberian Chemical Combine (SC) occupationally exposed to prolonged ionizing radiation. Material and Methods. The study included 44,041 employees of the SC, of whom 16,938 were occupationally exposed to prolonged low-intensity ionizing radiation (IR). Of 295 cases with hemoblastoses, there were 89 with occupational exposure to IR. The structure and incidence of hemoblastoses (based on the number of person-years of observation, (PYO), as well as the standardized relative risk (SRR) of their development and excess relative risk (ERR) per unit dose of radiation (Gr) were evaluated. Calculation of SRR was carried out for the following intervals of the total dose of external exposure: 0; >0-0.05; >0.05-0.10; >0.10-0.15; >0.15-0.20; >0.20-0.30; >0.30-0.50; >0.5-1.0; >= 1.0 G y. The control group consisted of occupationally non-exposed employees of the SC. The calculation of SRR and ERR was performed using the Poisson regression using the AM FIT module of the EPICU RE package. Results. The incidence of MNLT among males of SC was 17.1 per 100,000 P YO, with the highest incidence rates for Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL), chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CL) and chronic leukemia (CL) excluding CL. Among females of the SC, the incidence of MNLT was 21.3 per 100,000 PYO. It was found that in none of the intervals of the external exposure there was no statistically significant excess of the SRR compared with the control group. The results of ERR/Gy calculation also did not demonstrate the increased risk of hemoblastosis among people occupationally exposed to IR. Conclusion. Occupational exposure in the studied dose range does not increase the risk of developing MNLT.Copyright © 2020, Tomsk National Research Medical Center of the Russian Academy of Sciences.

385,"Radiation and host factors in human thyroid tumors following thymus irradiation. In this paper thyroid tumor data from the 1971 survey of the Rochester, New York thymus irradiated population are further analyzed to study radiobiological and host factors. The analyses were based on the approximately 2650 irradiated subjects and 4800 sibling controls who had 5 or more years of follow-up. Twenty-four thyroid cancers and 52 thyroid adenomas were found in the irradiated group, and 0 thyroid cancers and 6 adenomas among the controls. The overall risk estimates were 3.8 thyroid cancers/106 PY-rad and 4.5 thyroid adenomas/106 PY-rad. The dose-response data (thyroid dose range of 5 to > 1000 rad) for thyroid cancer indicate both a linear and a dose-squared component, but no dose-squared component is evident for thyroid adenomas. At lower total doses (< 400 rad) there was a suggestion that dose fractionation diminished the thyroid cancer response, but a similar fractionation effect was not found for thyroid adenomas. The temporal pattern of tumors suggested an extended plateau of excess tumor production, rather than a 'wavelike' temporal pattern. There was no evidence for an inverse relationship between thyroid radiation dose and thyroid cancer latency. Female and Jewish subjects had a higher risk of radiation-induced thyroid cancer than did their respective counterparts. The additive and multiplicative models of radiation effects were compared with respect to sex differences; neither model provided a superior fit to the data. The tentative nature of the conclusion is stressed because of the relatively small number of thyroid cancers.",Included
407,"The association between chronic kidney disease and cardiovascular disease risk factors in atomic bomb survivors. Atomic bomb (A-bomb) radiation is associated with cardiovascular disease (CVD) and metabolic CVD risk factors. Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is also known to be a risk factor for CVD and little is known whether CKD is associated with A-bomb radiation. To examine whether CKD is associated with CVD risk factors or with A-bomb radiation in A-bomb survivors, we classified renal dysfunction in 1,040 A-bomb survivors who were examined in 2004-2007 as normal [n = 121; estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) >= 90 ml/min/1.73 m(2)]; mild (n = 686; eGFR 60-89 ml/min/1.73 m(2)); moderate (n = 217; eGFR 30-59 ml/min/1.73 m(2)); or severe (n = 16; eGFR <30 ml/min/1.73 m(2)). Also, we diagnosed subjects in the moderate and severe renal dysfunction groups as having CKD (n = 233; eGFR <59 ml/min/1.73 m(2)). After adjusting for age, gender, and smoking and drinking habits, we looked for an association between renal dysfunction and hypertension, diabetes mellitus (DM), hyperlipidemia, and metabolic syndrome (MetS), and between renal dysfunction and A-bomb radiation. Hypertension [odds ratio (OR), 1.57; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.12-2.20, P = 0.009]; DM (OR, 1.79; 95% CI, 1.23-2.61, P = 0.002); hyperlipidemia (OR, 1.55; 95% CI, 1.12-2.14, P = 0.008); and MetS (OR, 1.86; 95% CI, 1.32-2.63, P < 0.001) were associated with CKD (moderate/severe renal dysfunction), and hyperlipidemia and MetS were also associated with mild renal dysfunction. CKD (OR/Gy, 1.29; 95% CI, 1.01-1.63, P = 0.038) and severe renal dysfunction (OR/Gy, 3.19; 95% CI, 1.63-6.25, P < 0.001) were significantly associated with radiation dose.

413,"Radioadaptive response in human lymphocytes in vitro. Exposure to low doses of radiation and/or chemicals can prime an organism to withstand the stress of a subsequent exposure to higher doses of the same agent. In the case of radiation, this phenomenon has been called radioadaptive response. Cytogenetic studies have been undertaken in human lymphocytes to investigate adaptive response (AR) to ionizing radiation, in particular to seek the role of variables such as priming dose, cell cycle stage, and age and gender of the donor. We demonstrated that pre-exposure of lymphocytes in whole blood cultures to very low doses in the range of about 1 cGy (priming or adaptive dose [AD]) reduced the frequency of micronuclei in binucleated cells induced by 100 cGy - that is, produced an AR in these cells in vitro. However, pre-exposure of cells to 10.0 cGy did not reduce the chromosomal damage (micronuclei) induced by the challenging dose (CD) of 100 cGy under the same protocol, thus exhibiting an inverse dose-response relationship. There was marked variability in the AR among the individuals investigated in the study. The extent of AR also depended on the stage of cell cycle exposed to the CD of radiation. Maximum AR was observed when CD of 100 cGy was given 4 hours after AD, 30 hours following the mitogenic stimulation of lymphocytes. The least AR was observed when CD was given 48 hours after stimulation. Interestingly, AR was also found to be dependent on the age of the donor, a decrease in AR being observed with an increasing age. No significant difference in AR was observed between male and female donors. To understand the molecular events underlying AR, protein synthesis patterns were studied in human lymphocytes subjected to mitogen, heat, or radiation stress. Heat shock (45 degreeC, for 15 min) induced 7 proteins with molecular weights ranging from 40 to 80 kDa, while treatment with phytohemagglutinin (40 mug/ mL) showed induction of 2 proteins of molecular weights 38 and 48 kDa, respectively. However, exposure of human lymphocyte cultures to gamma radiation did not significantly induce synthesis of any protein, up to 800 cGy dose. Lack of induction of proteins by gamma radiation in human lymphocytes contrasts with the previous reports showing X-ray radiation-enhanced gene expression in melanoma cells and/or human tumor fibroblasts.",Included

429,"DNA damage and repair of head and neck cancer cells after radio- and chemotherapy. DNA repair is critical for successful chemo- and radiotherapy of human tumours, because their genotoxic sensitivity may vary in different types of cancer cells. In this study we have compared DNA damage and the efficiency of its repair after genotoxic treatment with hydrogen peroxide, cisplatin and gamma-radiation of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC). Lymphocytes and tissue cells from biopsies of 37 cancer patients and 35 healthy donors as well as the HTB-43 larynx cancer cell line were employed. The cell sensitivity to genotoxic treatment was estimated by the MTT survival assay. The extent of DNA damage and efficiency of its repair was examined by the alkaline comet assay. Among the examined treatments, we found that HNSCC cells were the most sensitive to gamma-radiation and displayed impaired DNA repair. In particular, DNA damage was repaired less effectively in cells from HNSCC metastasis than healthy controls. In conclusion, our results suggest that the different genotoxic sensitivity of HNSCC cells may depend on their DNA repair capacity what in turn may be connected with the effectiveness of head and neck cancer therapy. © 2009 Verlag der Zeitschrift fur Naturforschung, Tubingen.",Included

436,"Mortality from solid cancers other than lung, liver, and bone in relation to external dose among plutonium and non-plutonium workers in the Mayak Worker Cohort. Exposure to ionizing radiation has well-documented long-term effects on cancer rates and other health outcomes in humans. While in vitro experimental studies had demonstrated that the nature of some radiation effects depend on both total dose of the radiation and the dose rate (i.e., the pattern of dose distribution over time), the question of whether or not the carcinogenic effect of radiation exposure depends on the dose rate remains unanswered. Another issue of interest concerns whether or not concomitant exposure to external gamma rays and inhaled plutonium aerosols has any effect on the external exposure effects. The analyses of the present paper focus on the risk of solid cancers at sites other than lung, liver, and bone in Mayak workers. Recent findings are reviewed indicating that there is no evidence of plutonium dose response for these cancers in the Mayak worker cohort. Then the evidence for differences in the external dose effects among workers with and without the potential for exposure to alpha particles from inhaled plutonium is examined. It is found that there is no evidence that exposure to plutonium aerosols significantly affects the risk associated with external exposure. While the Mayak external dose risk estimate of an excess relative risk of 0.16 per Gy is somewhat lower than an appropriately normalized risk estimate from the Life Span Study of Japanese atomic bomb survivors, the uncertainties in these estimates preclude concluding that the external dose excess relative risks of this group of solid cancers differ in the two cohorts.",Included

The radiation environment in deep space includes the galactic cosmic radiation with different proportions of all naturally occurring ions from protons to uranium. Most experimental animal studies for assessing the biological effects of charged particles have involved acute dose delivery for single ions and/or fractionated exposure protocols. Here, we assessed the behavioral and cognitive performance of female and male C57BL/6J x DBA2/J F1 (B6D2F1) mice 2 months following rapidly delivered, sequential irradiation with protons (1 GeV, 60%), 16O (250 MeV/n, 20%), and 28Si (263 MeV/n, 20%) at 0, 25, 50, or 200 cGy at 4-6 months of age. Cortical BDNF, CD68, and MAP-2 levels were analyzed 3 months after irradiation or sham irradiation. During the dark period, male mice irradiated with 50 cGy showed higher activity levels in the home cage than sham-irradiated mice. Mice irradiated with 50 cGy also showed increased depressive behavior in the forced swim test. When cognitive performance was assessed, sham-irradiated mice of both sexes and mice irradiated with 25 cGy showed normal responses to object recognition and novel object exploration. However, object recognition was impaired in female and male mice irradiated with 50 or 200 cGy. For cortical levels of the neurotrophic factor BDNF and the marker of microglial activation CD68, there were sex x radiation interactions. In females, but not males, there were increased CD68 levels following irradiation. In males, but not females, there were reduced BDNF levels following irradiation. A significant positive correlation between BDNF and CD68 levels was observed, suggesting a role for activated microglia in the alterations in BDNF levels. Finally, sequential beam irradiation impacted the diversity and composition of the gut microbiome. These included dose-dependent impacts and alterations to the relative abundance of several gut genera, such as Butyricicoccus and Lachnospiraceae. Thus, exposure to rapidly delivered sequential proton, 16O ion, and 28Si ion irradiation significantly affects behavioral and cognitive performance, cortical levels of CD68 and BDNF in a sex-dependent fashion, and the gut microbiome.",Included

Atherosclerosis-prone ApoE-/- mice fed a regular chow diet received single radiation doses of 14 Gy or sham treatments (0 Gy) to the neck, including both carotid arteries. At 22, 28, and 34 weeks after irradiation, blood samples were taken, and the arterial tree was removed for histological examination. Cholesterol levels in irradiated mice were not significantly different from age-matched controls, and markers of systemic inflammation (soluble intercellular adhesion molecule-1, soluble vascular cell adhesion molecule-1, and C-reactive protein) were not elevated. The lesions in irradiated arteries were macrophage rich, with a remarkable influx of inflammatory cells, predominantly granulocytes. Intraplaque hemorrhage and erythrocyte-containing macrophages were seen only in lesions of irradiated arteries. Based on these data, we propose that irradiation accelerates the development of macrophage-rich, inflammatory atherosclerotic lesions prone to intraplaque hemorrhage.",Included

It ranks among other asthenic syndromes reflecting a specific character of exogenous radiation effect on the organism, being a result of a characteristic interaction between the organism and a health hazard.

The PTR-MS was applied for detecting the volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in the exhaled breath from 42 radiotherapy patients and other 61 patients who had not received radiotherapy. All patients were enrolled in the local cancer hospital. In the experiment, the subjects breathe slowly to the PTR-MS through a direct inlet system without any sampling bag or tube. The breath mass spectrometric data was statistically analyzed using Mann-Whitney U test and stepwise discriminant analysis to find the characteristic ions of radiation exposure. Receiver operating characteristics (ROC) analysis was applied for a combination of the characteristic ions. The PTR-MS instrument was stable as the intensity of reaction ion H3(16)O(+) was maintained in 1.1%. Through statistically analysis, we found 6 kinds of characteristic ions of radiation exposure, specifically mass-to-charge ratio (m/z) 93, m/z 41, m/z 102, m/z 79, m/z 131, and m/z 143.

552,"Noncancer disease incidence in the atomic bomb survivors: 1958-1986. Using the longitudinal data of the Adult Health Study (AHS) cohort collected during 1958-1986, we examined for the first time the relationship between exposure to ionizing radiation and the incidence of 19 nonmalignant disorders in the A-bomb survivors. Affected individuals were ascertained through the three-digit codes of the International Classification of Diseases which are encoded in the AHS database subsequent to diagnoses made on the basis of general laboratory tests, physical examinations, and history-taking conducted during biennial AHS examinations. The disease onset time was estimated using the mid-point between the AHS examination data when the disease was initially reported and the previously attended disease-free examination date. Dosimetry System 86 organ doses judged to be most appropriate were used. Tests of dose effects were performed assuming a linear relative risk model with stratified background incidence. For the entire study period, significant excess risk was detected for uterine myoma (P < 0.001), chronic liver disease and cirrhosis (P = 0.006), and thyroid disease (P < 0.0001), defined broadly as the presence of one or more of certain noncancerous thyroid conditions. The incidence of myocardial infarction was shown to be increased (P = 0.03) in later years (1968-1986) among the younger heavily exposed AHS subjects, confirming the results of the recent Life Span Study (LSS) noncancer mortality report on coronary heart disease. The findings for uterine myoma may serve as additional evidence indicating benign tumor growth as a possible consequence of radiation exposure. Our results indicating the involvement of radiation in the development of liver diseases are consistent with the report of increased mortality from liver cirrhosis with radiation dose in the LSS cohort. An effect of age at exposure was detected for nonmalignant thyroid disease (P = 0.02), with an increased risk for those exposed who were under 20 years of age, but not for older survivors. Thus the AHS data suggest that thyroid glands in the young are more radiosensitive not only to the development of malignancies, but also to the development of nonmalignant disorders as well. The findings hold independently of the dose effects observed for thyroid cancer. This study also shows that for the period 1958-1986 new occurrences of lens opacity are not increased with radiation dose (P = 0.39) in the AHS subjects.",Included
563,"Elevated mortality among birds in Chernobyl as judged from skewed age and sex ratios. BACKGROUND: Radiation has negative effects on survival of animals including humans, although the generality of this claim is poorly documented under low-dose field conditions. Because females may suffer disproportionately from the effects of radiation on survival due to differences in sex roles during reproduction, radiation-induced mortality may result in male-skewed adult sex ratios., METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDING: We estimated the effects of low-dose radiation on adult survival rates in birds by determining age ratios of adults captured in mist nets during the breeding season in relation to background radiation levels around Chernobyl and in nearby uncontaminated control areas. Age ratios were skewed towards yearlings, especially in the most contaminated areas, implying that adult survival rates were reduced in contaminated areas, and that populations in such areas could only be maintained through immigration from nearby uncontaminated areas. Differential mortality in females resulted in a strongly male-skewed sex ratio in the most contaminated areas. In addition, males sang disproportionately commonly in the most contaminated areas where the sex ratio was male skewed presumably because males had difficulty finding and acquiring mates when females were rare. The results were not caused by permanent emigration by females from the most contaminated areas because none of the recaptured birds had changed breeding site, and the proportion of individuals with morphological abnormalities did not differ significantly between the sexes for areas with normal and higher levels of contamination., CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: These findings are consistent with the hypothesis that the adult survival rate of female birds is particularly susceptible to the effects of low-dose radiation, resulting in male skewed sex ratios at high levels of radiation. Such skewed age ratios towards yearlings in contaminated areas are consistent with the hypothesis that an area exceeding 30,000 km(2) in Chernobyl's surroundings constitutes an ecological trap that causes dramatic excess mortality.",Included

OBJECTIVE: To assess the influence of tumor cell proliferation and sex-hormone receptors on the efficacy of megavoltage irradiation for dogs with incompletely resected meningiomas., DESIGN: Longitudinal clinical trial., ANIMALS: 20 dogs with incompletely resected intracranial meningiomas., PROCEDURE: Dogs were treated with 48 Gy of radiation administered 3 times per week on an alternate-day schedule of 4 Gy/fraction for 4 weeks, using bilateral parallel-opposed fields., RESULTS: Tumor proliferative fraction measured by immunohistochemical detection of proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PFPCNA index) ranged from 10 to 42% (median, 24%). Progesterone receptor immunoreactivity was detected in 70% of tumors. Estrogen receptor immunoreactivity was not detected. An inverse correlation was found between detection of progesterone receptors and the PFPCNA index. The overall 2-year progression-free survival (PFS) rate was 68%. The only prognostic factor that significantly affected PFS rate was the PFPCNA index. The 2-year PFS was 42% for tumors with a high PFPCNA index (value > or = 24%) and 91% for tumors with a low PFPCNA index (value < 24%). Tumors with a high PFPCNA index were 9.1 times as likely to recur as were tumors with a low PFPCNA index., CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE: This study confirms the value of irradiation for dogs with incompletely resected meningiomas. Prognostic value of the PFPCNA index suggests-that duration of treatment and interval from surgery to start of irradiation may affect outcome. Loss of progesterone receptors in some tumors may be responsible for an increase in PFPCNA index and may indirectly affect prognosis after radiation therapy.",Included

INTRODUCTION: Radiation therapy (RT) of malignant tumors in the head and neck area may have damaging effects on surrounding tissues. The aim of this investigation was to evaluate the long-term effects of ionizing radiation on pulp vitality by measuring pulp oxygenation levels (%SpO2) in patients with history of RT of intraoral and oropharyngeal tumors 4-6 years after treatment., METHODS: In an experimental group RT (n = 90, history of RT) and a control group CON (n = 90, no history of RT), pulp vitality was assessed by measuring %SpO2 by using pulse oximetry and pulp sensitivity by cold thermal testing. All anterior teeth without history of endodontic therapy of the participants in group RT were measured (n = 693), regardless of the quadrant and the irradiated area. An equal number of anterior teeth were tested in group CON., RESULTS: There was no significant difference between the %SpO2 levels in group RT (92.7%; standard deviation, +/- 1.83) and group CON (92.6%; standard deviation, +/- 1.80). All teeth in RT and CON groups showed a positive response to the thermal test. All tested teeth were considered vital., CONCLUSIONS: Pulp %SpO2 was found to be within normal limits 4-6 years after RT. This suggests that RT may not have a long-term influence on pulp vitality, and reported short-term changes in pulpal microcirculation because of RT may be temporary.

Infections after irradiation can be due to a great variety of microorganisms many of which are normally non-pathogenic or conditionally pathogenic for the host. The strain of Y. enterocolitica used was not pathogenic to a variety of unirradiated rats nor to athymic or B lymphocyte deprived, macrophage depleted rats, nor to normal rats irradiated by 5.7 Gy 24 hours before. However similarly irradiated rats receiving Y. enterocolitica 5 to 10 days later showed a substantial mortality. It is concluded that the radiosensitive mechanism for protection against Y. enterocolitica is not humoral nor cellular immunity as mediated by T and B lymphocytes or macrophages.",Included

774,"p53 expression in human rectal tissue after radiotherapy: upregulation in normal mucosa versus functional loss in rectal carcinomas. PURPOSE: In vitro, ionizing radiation of epithelial cells leads to upregulation of wild-type p53 and subsequent induction of p21(waf1). The effect of radiotherapy (RT) on the expression of these proteins in patients is unknown. We assessed the influence of RT on the expression of p53 and p21(waf1) in normal mucosa and rectal carcinomas in vivo., METHODS: Tumor and normal tissue samples were derived from rectal cancer patients randomized in a clinical trial in which the value of preoperative RT was evaluated. p53 and p21(waf1) expression was determined in 51 irradiated and 52 nonirradiated patients using immunohistochemistry., RESULTS: In normal mucosa, both p53 and p21(waf1) were strongly upregulated after RT compared with the expression in unirradiated normal tissue (p <0.001). In tumor cells, no significant difference in the expression of p53 or p21(waf1) was found in the irradiated vs. nonirradiated group. In the few rectal tumors with wild-type p53, induction of p53 after RT did not necessarily lead to upregulation of p21(waf1)., CONCLUSION: These findings demonstrate that in normal mucosa, a functional p53-p21(waf1) pathway is present, whereas in tumor cells it is defective in almost all cases because of either p53 mutation or down- or upstream disruption in tumors with wild-type p53. Therefore, we believe that the role of p53 expression as a single prognostic marker in rectal cancer needs reconsideration.",Included

813,"Damage-induced apoptosis in primary human lymphocytes is a genetic program modified by gender and age. Apoptosis is a core pathway deregulated in hematologic and other cancers. Although there are considerable functional and genetic data on the regulation of apoptosis in vitro and in model organisms, little is known about how these pathways are modified in primary cells freshly isolated from people, who are continually subjected to a variety of different and often unquantified environmental stimuli. We hypothesize that these exposures may have important and as yet unappreciated modifying effects on apoptosis that may have implications for cancer risk or response to therapy. To test this, we isolated peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from 90 normal healthy individuals and treated them with 5 Gy ionizing radiation (IR). Damage-induced apoptosis was measured at 24 hours after IR by TUNEL. We observed surprising heterogeneity in apoptosis among individuals, ranging from 21-65 percent. To determine whether this diversity in response was programmed or stochastic, we repeated the experiment 3 times in 10 individuals spanning the entire IR-induced apoptotic range and found results to be completely reproducible within individuals, suggesting that it resulted from a genetic program. We then assessed the association with individual characteristics. Whereas neither race nor age was associated with IR-induced apoptosis, gender was significantly associated (Mean: 44.8% vs 32.9%; p = 1.02 x 10-8). Moreover, when stratified by gender, age was significantly associated with IR-induced apoptosis in males (p = 0.026) but not females (p = 0.94). Thus, we conclude that IR-induced apoptosis in freshly isolated human PBMCs results from an intrinsic genetic program modified by age, but only within males. Genetic models to explain this will be discussed.",Included

Previously we put forward a hypothesis about the role of FOXO-dependent mechanisms of stress-response gene activation after irradiation in radiation hormesis (Moskalev, 2008). To testify this assumption we analyze the influence of gamma-irradiation on duration of larvae development and imago lifespan in Drosophila strains with different FOXO function activity. We revealed that in FOXO hypomorphic allele homozygote strains the hormesis and adaptive response (increasing of larvae stage duration and longevity) were absent, in contrast to B wild type strain Canton-S and FOXO-heterozygotes.",Included
828,"Altered mechanical behavior of demineralized bone following therapeutic radiation. Post-radiotherapy (RTx) bone fragility fractures are a late-onset complication occurring in bone within or underlying the radiation field. These fractures are difficult to predict, as patients do not present with local osteopenia. Using a murine hindlimb RTx model, we previously documented decreased mineralized bone strength and fracture toughness, but alterations in material properties of the organic bone matrix are largely unknown. In this study, 4 days of fractionated hindlimb irradiation (4 x 5 Gy) or Sham irradiation was administered in a mouse model (BALB/cJ, end points: 0, 4, 8, and 12 weeks, n = 15/group/end point). Following demineralization, the viscoelastic stress relaxation, and monotonic tensile mechanical properties of tibiae were determined. Irradiated tibiae demonstrated an immediate (day after last radiation fraction) and sustained (4, 8, 12 weeks) increase in stress relaxation compared to the Sham group, with a 4.4% decrease in equilibrium stress (p <.017). While tensile strength was not different between groups, irradiated tibiae had a lower elastic modulus (-5%, p =.027) and energy to failure (-12.2%, p =.012) with monotonic loading. Gel electrophoresis showed that therapeutic irradiation (4 x 5 Gy) does not result in collagen fragmentation, while irradiation at a common sterilization dose (25 kGy) extensively fragmented collagen. These results suggest that altered collagen mechanical behavior has a role in postirradiation bone fragility, but this can occur without detectable collagen fragmentation. Statement of Clinical Significance: Therapeutic irradiation alters bone organic matrix mechanics and which contribute to diminished fatigue strength, but this does not occur via collagen fragmentation.Copyright © 2020 Orthopaedic Research Society.

834,"Estimating the incidence of leukemia attributable to occupational exposure in Iran. Objective: The aim this study was to estimate the fraction of leukemia incidence in Iran attributable to occupational exposure to benzene, ionizing radiation, and ethylene oxide. Method(s): Nationwide exposure to each of these leukemogens was estimated using workforce data available at the ILO (International Labor Organization) website. The prevalence of exposure to leukemogens in each industry was estimated using exposure data from the CAREX (CARcinogen EXposure) database. The magnitude of the relative risk of leukemia for each leukemogen was from published literature. Using the Levin's population attributable risk (incidence), fractions of leukemia incidences attributed to workplace leukemogens were then estimated. Result(s): The total workforce in Iran according to the 1995 census included 12,488,020 men and 677,469 women. Agriculture was the largest sector with 24.5% of the males and 0.27% of the females, and the electricals-related sector was the smallest with 1.16% of the males and 0.66% of the females. After applying the CAREX exposure estimates to each sector, the proportion exposed to leukemogens was 0.016% for male workers and 0.02% for female workers. Estimating a relative risk of 3.6 (95% CI of 3.2-4.2) for high exposure and 1.9 (95% CI 1.7-2.1) for low exposure and employing the Levin's formula, the fraction of leukemia attributed to leukemogens in the workplaces among females was 3.6% (95% CI of 3.1-4.5) and among males was 7.6% (95% CI of 6.4-9.2). These fractions corresponded to estimated incidences of 0.60 (95% CI of 0.50-0.70) and 0.22 (95% CI of 0.16-0.23) cases of leukemia per 100,000 populations for males and females, respectively. Conclusion(s): The incidence of leukemia due to occupational exposure is very low in Iran, although males are at greater risk than females.",Included

Background: In clinical radiotherapy most patients tolerate the applied dosage with no or moderate side effects. However, 5 to 10% of all individuals show increased acute and/or late reactions. In-vitro test systems are investigated for their suitability for predictive purposes. This paper attempts a correlation between the induction and repair of DNA damage measured in the comet assay and the clinical observed reaction in order to evaluate the suitability of the comet assay for prediction of radiation sensitivity. Patients and Methods: Skin fibroblasts of 30 patients with average tissue reactions or acute and/or late increased side effects and cell lines of 4 individuals carrying the heritable disease ataxia telangiectasia (AT) were irradiated in vitro. The induction and repair of DNA damage was measured at different time points after irradiation in the comet assay (single cell gel electrophoresis). These results were compared to the acute and late clinical reactions classified according to the RTOG grading system. Result(s): The radiation induced DNA damage decreased over time reflecting DNA repair. Cells of the AT individuals showed an elevated damage induction and a reduced repair capacity compared to patients with average tissue reactions. Fibroblasts of patients with increased acute and late side effects exhibited slower DNA repair. In addition to the known lack of cell cycle control, our results indicate that AT cells show reduced DNA repair capacity. Conclusion(s): The comet assay seems to be able to detect some types of increased individual radiation sensitivity. In contrast to other predictive in-vitro tests, the comet assay needs less time and fewer cells, which would be useful in a clinical setting.",Included
842,"Interventional cardiologists and risk of radiation-induced cataract: results of a French multicenter observational study. BACKGROUND: Interventional cardiologists (ICs) are exposed to X-rays and may be at risk to develop cataract earlier than common senile cataract. Excess risk of posterior subcapsular cataract, known as radiation-induced, was previously observed in samples of ICs from Malaysia, and Latin America. The O'CLOC study (Occupational Cataracts and Lens Opacities in interventional Cardiology) was performed to quantify the risk at the scale of France., METHODS: This cross-sectional multicenter study included an exposed group of ICs from different French centers and an unexposed control group of non-medical workers. Individual information was collected about cataract risk factors and past and present workload in catheterization laboratory. All participants had a clinical eye examination to classify the lens opacities (nuclear, cortical, or posterior subcapsular) with the international standard classification LOCS III., RESULTS: The study included 106 ICs (mean age = 51 +/- 7 years) and 99 unexposed control subjects (mean age = 50 +/- 7 years). The groups did not differ significantly in the prevalence of either nuclear or cortical lens opacities (61% vs. 69% and 23% vs. 29%, respectively). However, posterior subcapsular lens opacities, were significantly more frequent among ICs (17% vs. 5%, p=0.006), for an OR=3.9 [1.3-11.4]. The risk increased with duration of activity but no clear relationship with workload was observed. However, the risk appeared lower for regular users of protective lead glasses (OR=2.2 [0.4-12.8])., CONCLUSIONS: ICs, in France as elsewhere, are at high risk of posterior subcapsular cataracts. Use of protective equipment against X-rays, in particular lead glasses, is strongly recommended to limit this risk. Copyright © 2012 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.",Included

Background and Aims Patients with Inflammatory Bowel disease (IBD) are frequently exposed to diagnostic medical radiation for the diagnosis and evaluation of their disease. Despite increasing awareness of the potentially serious downstream effects, few studies have quantified radiation exposure in IBD patients. Methods We conducted a retrospective review of 225 consecutive patients attending IBD clinics at our hospital. Clinical data including demographics, disease characteristics and therapy were obtained from case note and electronic patient record review. All incidences of diagnostic medical radiation from initial diagnosis until 30 June 2010 inclusive were recorded from case note and computerised radiology database system review. The radiation dose for each procedure was obtained from published tables from the Royal College of Radiologists, UK. Effective dose for each procedure was calculated by multiplying this value by the number of procedures during the study period. The sum of doses received was the cumulative effective dose. Results One hundred and two of the 225 IBD patients reviewed were female, 123 were male. The median age was 48 (Range 17-88) and mean disease duration 9.8 years. One hundred and four patients had Crohn's disease, 113 patients had ulcerative colitis and 8 patients had an indeterminate colitis. The mean and median cumulative effective radiation doses were 11.35 mSv and 5.12 mSv respectively. A cumulative radiation dose greater than 10 mSv was seen in 40.9% (92) patients and greater than 25 mSv in 12.9% (29) patients. In 9 patients the cumulative effective dose was greater than 50 mSv. Crohn's disease was associated with a higher cumulative effective dose with exposure exceeding 10 mSv in 60.6%, 25 mSv in 22.1% and 50 mSv in 8.7% patients respectively. CT imaging accounted for 43% and barium studies for 32% of the total cumulative effective dose exposure. Thirty-nine patients had small bowel magnetic resonance (MR) studies as an alternative to ionising radiation in the last 3 years. Conclusions Patients with IBD, particularly those with Crohn's disease are exposed to significant amounts of diagnostic medical radiation in their lifetime. The increased risk of cancer from cumulative radiation coupled with the inherent risk of colorectal malignancy in long standing IBD and the potential for immunomodulator drugs such as azathioprine to increase the risk of cancers (e.g. lymphoma) is of great clinical and public health concern. Clinicians must remain vigilant to these risks when evaluating these patients and radiation exposure should be minimised and when possible alternatives such as intestinal ultrasound and MR imaging should be preferred.",Included
901,"Late effects in ankylosing spondylitis patients treated with 224Ra. This study is comprised of 1577 ankylosing spondylitis patients from 9 German hospitals who have been treated with multiple injections of 224Ra. The majority of the patients, most of them treated in the years 1948-1975, received one series of 10 weekly intravenous injections of about 1 MBq of 224Ra each. This dose leads to a mean absorbed dose due to alpha-particle radiation of 0.56 Gy to the marrow-free skeleton of a 70-kg man (mean bone surface dose of about 5 Gy). To provide comparative information on causes of death and on health effects possibly related to the basic disease itself, a control group of 1462 ankylosing spondylitis patients with roughly the same age distribution has been established. By the end of 1998, 649 patients in the exposed group and 762 control patients had died. Among other observations, it is of particular interest that 13 cases of leukemia in the exposed group have been observed. This is a highly significant excess (P < 0.001) compared to a standard population, but only a marginally significant excess in comparison to the seven cases observed in the control group. Subclassification of the leukemias shows a clear preponderance of the myeloid leukemias in the exposed group (8 cases observed compared to 1.7 cases expected, P < 0.001), whereas in the control group the observed cases are within the expected range for myeloid leukemia (3 cases observed compared to 2.2 cases expected, P = 0.3). The 224Ra cohort of the earlier study (higher-dose group) has provided a risk coefficient that predicts about 8 excess malignant bone tumors for the irradiated cohort in this study. In actuality, 4 cases of malignant tumors in the skeleton have been observed so far. However, excess of breast cancer has not been observed in either the irradiated or the control group, which is in contrast to the findings in the earlier 224Ra cohort of Study I.",Included
902,"Ionizing radiation regulates the expression of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) in epithelial cancer cells: modulation of cellular signals regulating cell cycle and survival. PURPOSE: To analyze the (i) expression of AMPK in a variety of epithelial cancer cells, (ii) regulation of AMPK subunit expression by ionizing radiation (IR) and (iii) impact of AMPK on signaling pathways regulating cell cycle and survival., METHODS AND MATERIALS: Human lung, prostate, and breast normal and cancer cells were treated with 0 or 8 Gy IR and mRNA and protein levels of AMPK were evaluated by RT-PCR and immunoblotting 24 or 48 h later. Untreated and radiated wild type (WT) and AMPKalpha(-/-) mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) were analyzed by immunoblotting using total- and phosphorylation-specific antibodies. Histone H2Ax was examined by fluorescence microscopy. The cell cycle and survival of WT and AMPKalpha(-/-) MEFs was also evaluated following 8 Gy by IR., RESULTS: AMPK subunits were found widely expressed in normal and cancer epithelial cells. IR increased subunit protein levels and stimulated gene transcription in cancer cells. AMPKalpha(-/-)-MEFs showed enhanced basal total levels of ATM and phosphorylation of its substrates histone H2Ax, but inhibited response of these markers and of checkpoint kinase Chk2 phosphorylation to IR. AMPKalpha(-/-)-MEFs showed increased basal levels of p53 and cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors p21(cip1), but lack of response of both genes to IR. These cells had increased basal levels and activation of the Akt-mTOR-p70(S6K)/4-EBP1 signalling pathway. IR increased Akt, p70(S6K) and 4-EBP1 phosphorylation in WT-MEFs, but this was reduced in AMPKalpha(-/-)-MEFs. AMPKalpha(-/-)-MEFs failed to arrest at the G2-M checkpoint after IR and showed a trend for radio-resistance in proliferation assays., CONCLUSIONS: AMPK is widely expressed in human normal and cancer epithelial cells and its gene transcription, protein levels, and enzymatic activity is stimulated by IR. Work with AMPKalpha knockout cells suggests that AMPK (i) may mediate a suppressive regulation on basal expression and activity of ATM and its downstream effector pathways Chk2/p53-p21(cip1) and Akt-mTOR, (ii) facilitates the normal response of these pathways to IR and, (iii) mediates the IR-induced G2-M checkpoint.

906,"Assessment of DNA damage in nuclear medicine personnel--comparative study with the alkaline comet assay and the chromosome aberration test. Despite much research over the last few decades, there still remains considerable uncertainty as to the genetic impact of ionizing radiation on human populations, particularly at low levels. The aim of the present study was to provide data on the genetic hazards due to occupational exposure of low doses of ionizing radiation in nuclear medicine departments. The assessment of primary DNA damage in peripheral blood leukocytes of medical staff was performed using the alkaline comet assay and the data obtained were compared with the results of conventional cytogenetic biodosimetry using the chromosome aberration (CA) test. Altogether 120 subjects (60 exposed and 60 controls) participated in the study. Statistically significant increases in primary DNA damage and increased frequencies of CAs compared to controls were observed. Within the exposed population, significant inter-individual differences in DNA damage were found, indicating differences in genome sensitivity. Age and gender were not confounding factors, while smoking enhanced the levels of primary DNA damage only in control subjects, as revealed by both biomarkers studied. The present study suggests that genotoxic damage results from exposure to chronic low doses of ionizing radiation in nuclear medicine departments. Therefore, the exposed medical personnel should carefully comply with the radiation protection procedures and should minimize radiation exposure where possible to avoid potential genotoxic effects. The results obtained in this study point to the significance of biological indicators providing information on the actual risk to the radiation exposed individuals. According to our results, the alkaline comet assay and CA test are sensitive biomarkers that can be used as additional complements to physical dosimetry for assessing exposure to radiation in nuclear medicine personnel.",Included

931,"Differential effects of genotoxic stress on both concurrent body growth and gradual senescence in the adult zebrafish. Among vertebrates, fish and mammals show intriguing differences in their growth control properties with age. The potential for unlimited or indeterminate growth in a variety of fish species has prompted many questions regarding the senescent phenomena that appear during the aging process in these animals. Using zebrafish as our model system, we have attempted in our current study to examine the growth phenomena in fish in relation to the onset of senescence-associated symptoms, and to evaluate the effects of genotoxic stress on these processes. We observed in the course of these analyses that the zebrafish undergoes continuous growth, irrespective of age, past the point of sexual maturation with gradually decreasing growth rates at later stages. Animal population density, current body size and chronological age also play predominant roles in regulating zebrafish growth and all inversely influence the growth rate. Interestingly, the induction of genotoxic stress by exposure to ionizing radiation (IR) did not adversely affect this body growth ability in zebrafish. However, IR was found to chronically debilitate the regeneration of amputated caudal fins and thereby induce high levels of abnormal fin regeneration in the adult zebrafish. In addition, by resembling and mimicking the natural course of aging, IR treatments likewise enhanced several other symptoms of senescence, such as a decline in reproductive abilities, increased senescence-associated beta-galactosidase activity and a reduction in melatonin secretion. Our current data thus suggest that during the lifespan of zebrafish, the onset of senescence-associated symptoms occurs in parallel with continuous growth throughout mid-adulthood. Moreover, our present findings indicate that genotoxic DNA damage may play a role as a rate-limiting factor during the induction of senescence, but not in the inhibition of continuous, density-dependent growth in adult zebrafish.",Included

Therapeutic exposure to ionising radiation reveals inter-individual variations in normal tissue responses. To examine whether a defect in DNA repair capacity might be involved in such hypersensitive phenotypes, we analysed, using the alkaline comet assay, the response as a function of time to in vitro irradiation at 5 Gy of lymphocytes from 17 breast cancer and 9 Hodgkin's disease patients who developed severe reactions to radiotherapy in comparison with 22 patients with 'average' reactions and 24 healthy donors. A difference between breast cancer over-reactors and both patients with normal reactions and healthy donors was observed 30 and 60 min after exposure. A subgroup of breast cancer over-reactors (7/17) reproducibly demonstrated increased levels of residual damage. When the kinetic analyses were prolonged to 120 min, results were in favour of delayed kinetics of rejoining in these patients. Among Hodgkin's disease over-reactors, only one patient showed defective repair. Interestingly, all patients with the most severe complications (grade 4 RTOG/EORTC), i.e., 5 breast cancer and 1 Hodgkin's disease, showed impaired rejoining. Our results suggest that impairment in DNA strand break processing may be associated, in specific subgroups of breast cancer patients, with an individual risk of major toxicity of radiation therapy. Thus, the alkaline comet assay appears to be useful for documenting the DNA repair phenotype in cancer patients.",Included

Spleen cells of (C57BL/6 X C3H/He)F1 mice were assayed for natural killer (NK) cell activity against YAC-1 and FBL-3 lymphoma targets at several intervals after total-body exposure to a high sublethal dose of 137Cs or 60Co gamma-rays. NK cell activity did not decline for the first 12 days but decreased sharply thereafter and remained low until day 24. The recovery of splenic NK cell activity was delayed. Beginning on day 28, the activity was slowly increased, reaching near-normal levels (80% of controls) 41-59 days after irradiation. Suppressor cells detectable during the period of lowest NK cell activity, i.e., on days 17 and 19, may have been responsible for the delayed and slow recovery. These studies indicated that a) mature effectors of natural cytotoxicity are relatively radioresistant renewable cells with a lifespan of about 2 weeks whose progenitors are radiosensitive cells b) the kinetics of decline and especially of recovery of NK cell activity may be influenced by suppressor cells. Should NK cell activity confer resistance to autochthonous lymphomas in vivo, it may be a significant consideration for strategies of tumor therapy by cytotoxic agents that reconstitution of the NK cell pool is a slow process and that suppressor cell function must be overcome for full recovery.",Included

1011,"Lifetime cancer risks from occupational radiation exposure among workers at interventional radiology departments. PURPOSE: Interventional medical radiation workers represent an under-studied population worldwide, although they receive relatively high occupational radiation doses. This study aimed to estimate the lifetime cancer risk from occupational radiation exposure among workers at interventional radiology departments. METHOD(S): A field survey of interventional medical workers in nationwide branches of the Korean Society of Interventional Radiology was conducted in 2017. Organ-specific radiation doses were estimated using national dose registry data and conversion coefficients provided by the International Commission on Radiological Protection. Lifetime attributable risk (LAR) and lifetime fractional risk (LFR) were calculated based on realistic exposure scenarios using a radiation risk assessment tool. RESULT(S): LARs from occupational radiation exposure until the age of retirement for all cancers combined were 338 (90.3-796.1), 121 (33.5-288.7), and 156 (41.1-390.6) per 100,000 individuals for male radiologists, male radiologic technologists, and female nurses, respectively. LFR for all cancers combined ranged from 0.22% (0.06-0.53) to 0.63% (0.17-1.47). Regarding the organ site, the highest LAR and LFR among all groups were observed for thyroid cancer. CONCLUSION(S): This study provides timely evidence of potential cancer burden from the current levels of occupational radiation exposure among workers at interventional radiology departments. The risks varied by occupational groups, and workers, particularly interventional radiologists, need to be carefully monitored for radiation.",Included

BACKGROUND: Bone grafts promote bone healing by supplying a three-dimensional structure that supports bone ingrowth. Autologous bone therefore still remains the ""gold standard"" for grafts. Unfortunately, autologous bone grafts are associated with an increased morbidity. In order to avoid such problems, intensive research has been carried out on alternative materials such as allogeneic bone. However, its use is dependent on bone banks and its availability is limited. Gamma irradiation is now becoming established as a procedure for inactivating bacteria, fungal spores and viruses. Its effects on the biomechanical properties of bone have been analyzed in numerous studies. However, the current literature provides little information as to the effects of gamma sterilization on the osteobiology of allogeneic bone grafts., PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effect of gamma-sterilized bone grafts on immunocompetent cells by an in vitro model (a culture of human bone marrow cells)., METHODS: We decided to use the model of human bone marrow cells in culture for the in vitro analysis because the physiological conditions in the human body can best be simulated in this model and the observed reactions are applicable to humans., RESULTS AND INTERPRETATION: In sum, we found a maximum immune response in gamma-irradiated bone grafts, which, interpreted as a sole result, must be seen as a negative biological effect. However, in view of the good clinical results for gamma-sterilized bone grafts other influences would seem to be the determining factors in clinical outcome. Further research is needed to gain a more exact understanding of these factors.",Included

BACKGROUND: Orthopedic strain and radiation exposure are recognized risk factors in personnel staff performing fluoroscopically guided cardiovascular procedures. However, the potential occupational health effects are still unclear. The purpose of this study was to examine the prevalence of health problems among personnel staff working in interventional cardiology/cardiac electrophysiology and correlate them with the length of occupational radiation exposure., METHODS AND RESULTS: We used a self-administered questionnaire to collect demographic information, work-related information, lifestyle-confounding factors, all current medications, and health status. A total number of 746 questionnaires were properly filled comprising 466 exposed staff (281 males; 44+/-9 years) and 280 unexposed subjects (179 males; 43+/-7years). Exposed personnel included 218 interventional cardiologists and electrophysiologists (168 males; 46+/-9 years); 191 nurses (76 males; 42+/-7 years), and 57 technicians (37 males; 40+/-12 years) working for a median of 10 years (quartiles: 5-24 years). Skin lesions (P=0.002), orthopedic illness (P<0.001), cataract (P=0.003), hypertension (P=0.02), and hypercholesterolemia (P<0.001) were all significantly higher in exposed versus nonexposed group, with a clear gradient unfavorable for physicians over technicians and nurses and for longer history of work (>16 years). In highly exposed physicians, adjusted odds ratio ranged from 1.7 for hypertension (95% confidence interval: 1-3; P=0.05), 2.9 for hypercholesterolemia (95% confidence interval: 1-5; P=0.004), 4.5 for cancer (95% confidence interval: 0.9-25; P=0.06), to 9 for cataract (95% confidence interval: 2-41; P=0.004)., CONCLUSIONS: Health problems are more frequently observed in workers performing fluoroscopically guided cardiovascular procedures than in unexposed controls, raising the need to spread the culture of safety in the cath laboratory.

1082,"Occupational ionising radiation and risk of basal cell carcinoma in US radiologic technologists (1983-2005). Objective To determine risk for incident basal cell carcinoma from cumulative low-dose ionising radiation in the US radiologic technologist cohort. Methods We analysed 65 719 Caucasian technologists who were cancer-free at baseline (1983-1989 or 1994-1998) and answered a follow-up questionnaire (2003-2005). Absorbed radiation dose to the skin in mGy for estimated cumulative occupational radiation exposure was reconstructed for each technologist based on badge dose measurements, questionnaire-derived work history and protection practices, and literature information. Radiation-Associated risk was assessed using Poisson regression and included adjustment for several demographic, lifestyle, host and sun exposure factors. Results Cumulative mean absorbed skin dose (to head/ neck/arms) was 55.8 mGy (range 0-1735 mGy). For lifetime cumulative dose, we did not observe an excess radiation-related risk (excess relative risk/Gy=-0.01 (95% CI -0.43 to 0.52). However, we observed that basal cell carcinoma risk was increased for radiation dose received before age 30 (excess relative risk/ Gy=0.59, 95% CI -0.11 to 1.42) and before 1960 (excess relative risk/Gy=2.92, 95% CI 1.39 to 4.45). Conclusions Basal cell carcinoma risk was unrelated to low-dose radiation exposure among radiologic technologists. Because of uncertainties in dosimetry and sensitivity to model specifications, both our null results and our findings of excess risk for dose received before age 30 and exposure before 1960 should be interpreted with caution.",Included
1093,"The age-dependent effect of high-dose X-ray radiation on NFkappaB signaling, structure, and mechanical behavior of the intervertebral disc. Purpose: Ionizing radiation damages tissue and provokes inflammatory responses in multiple organ systems. We investigated the effects of high-dose X-ray radiation on the molecular inflammation and mechanical function of the intervertebral disc (IVD). Methods: Functional spine units (FSUs) containing the vertebrae-IVDs-vertebrae structure extracted from 1-month, 6-month, and 16-month-old NFkappaB-luciferase reporter mice and from 6-month-old myeloid differentiation factor 88 (MyD88)-null mice. After a preconditioning period in culture, the FSUs were subjected a single dose of ionizing X-ray radiation at 20 Gys, and then NFkappaB expression was monitored. The IVDs were then subjected to mechanical testing using dynamic compression, glycosaminoglycan (GAG) quantification, and histological analyses. Results: In the 1-month-old FSUs, the NFkappaB-driven luciferase activity was significantly elevated for 1 day following the exposure to radiation. The 6-month-old FSUs showed increased NFkappaB activity for 3 days, while the 16-month-old FSUs sustained elevated levels of NFkappaB activity throughout the 10-day culture period. All irradiated groups showed significant loss of disc height, GAG content, mechanical function and changes in structure. Ablation of MyD88 blunted the radiation-mediated NFkappaB signaling, and preserved GAG content, and the IVDs' structure and mechanical performance. Conclusions: These results suggest that high-dose radiation affects the IVDs' NFkappaB-dependent inflammatory processes that subsequently lead to functional deterioration. Blocking the transactivation potential of NFkappaB via MyD88 ablation preserved the structure and mechanical function of the FSUs. The long-term effects of radiation on IVD homeostasis should be considered in individuals susceptible to occupational and medical exposure.",Included

In some groups, mice aged 33 +/- 3 days were submitted to either sham, neutron or cobalt external radiation at 32, 45, 63, 88 and 123 mGy or at 18, 25, 36 and 51 cGy dose levels, respectively. In other groups, mice either at birth or weaning, were injected with tritiated thymidine or tritiated water, or were given tritiated water as drinking water for the entire lifespan. The main purpose of the experiment was to investigate the low dose-response relationship of cancer induction, especially leukemogenesis and to evaluate the excess risk, using actuarial age-specific rates. Following neutron or cobalt exposure, the phenotypic occurrence of lymphocytic lymphomas was earlier in appearance and higher in yield during the first decades of lifespan in irradiated groups versus matching controls, whereas such occurrence was markedly lower in yield at a later age. Under parallel experimental conditions, induction of reticulum cell lymphomas, however, was uniformly enhanced throughout the entire lifespan. Induction rates of all tumors (reticular and solid) pooled were significantly increased, and more so following cobalt than neutron irradiation. In mice injected with tritiated thymidine, the overall tumor incidence was increased monotonically throughout the lifespan. In mice exposed to tritiated water, the incidence of lymphocytic lymphomas was markedly increased throughout the lifespan, whereas no such effect was observed for reticulum cell tumors. In the light of tumor data analysis, it appears that selection of a particular type of tumor as a dependent variable for dose-response assessment cannot disregard the primary modulation of the whole tumor spectrum. In C57 Black murine leukemogenesis, the shape and structure of the dose-response regression curve over the entire lifespan does not fit the linear-quadratic model. It is, however, theorized that our data are consistent with the two-mutation clonal expansion model, assuming creation of initiated cells which are added to the pool of spontaneously occurring initiated cells and implying that the excess risk is initially high at early age and then decreases with increasing age following exposure. It is concluded that murine radiocarcinogenesis investigation may contribute to improving the assessment as well as understanding the underlying mechanisms of low level radiation hazards.

NKG2D is a primary activating receptor that triggers cell-mediated cytotoxicity in NK cells against tumor and virus-infected cells. We previously identified the NKG2D haplotypes in the natural killer gene complex region on chromosome 12p. Two major haplotype alleles, LNK1 and HNK1, were closely related to low and high natural cytotoxic activity phenotypes, respectively. Furthermore, the haplotype of HNK1/HNK1 has revealed a decreased risk of cancer compared with LNK1/LNK1. In the present study, using flow cytometry, we evaluated the functional effects of NKG2D haplotypes and five htSNPs in terms of the cell-surface expression of NKG2D protein on NK and CD8 T cells of peripheral blood among 732 atomic-bomb survivors. NKG2D expression on NK cells showed significant increases, in the order of LNK1/LNK1, LNK1/HNK1 and HNK1/HNK1 haplotypes (p for trend = 0.003), or with major homozygous, heterozygous, and minor homozygous genotypes for individual htSNPs (p for trend = 0.02-0.003). The same trend was observed for NKG2D expression on CD8 T cells. Our findings indicate that the NKG2D haplotypes are associated with the expression levels of NKG2D protein on NK and CD8 T cells, resulting in inter-individual variations in human cytotoxic response. © 2012 American Society for Histocompatibility and Immunogenetics.",Included

To investigate the pathologic consequences of therapeutic radiation, this morphologic study evaluated the brains of 25 patients with intracranial gliomas treated both with and without this form of therapy. Although beneficial effects such as the retardation of tumor growth were evident in these studies, among the seventeen patients who received from 5000--6000 rads for malignant gliomas, four developed ""late delayed"" radiation necrosis. The strong predilection of this tissue response for the white matter adjacent to the neoplasm suggests a local sensitivity which may have been engendered or enhanced by cerebral edema. A fifth case disclosed focal demyelination in the mid-brain suggesting ""early delayed"" radiation necrosis, and an additional case had distinctive foci of necrosis within the brain stem. Changes of diffuse cerebral edema were noted in many of the radiated brains.

The effects of carbon ion irradiation and ferulic acid (FA) on the induction of oxidative stress and alteration of gene expression were studied in zebrafish (Danio rerio) embryos. Zebrafish embryos at 8 hpf were divided into seven groups: the control group; the 1Gy, 3Gy and 7Gy irradiation groups; and three FA-pre-treated irradiation groups. In the irradiated groups, a significant increase in the teratogenesis of the zebrafish embryos and oxidative stress was accompanied by increased malondialdehyde (MDA) content, decreased glutathione (GSH) content and alterations in antioxidant enzyme activities (such as catalase [CAT] and superoxide dismutase [SOD]). Moreover, the mRNA levels for Cu/Zn-sod, Mn-sod, cat and gpx, the genes encoding these antioxidant proteins, were altered significantly. However, the mRNA expression patterns were not in accordance with those of the antioxidant enzymes and were more sensitive under low-dose irradiation. In addition, we detected the mRNA expression of ucp-2 and bcl-2, which are located at the mitochondrial inner membrane and related to reactive oxidative species (ROS) production. In the irradiated groups, the mRNA level of ucp-2 was significantly increased, whereas the mRNA level of bcl-2 was significantly decreased. Supplementation with FA, an antioxidant, was better able to reduce the irradiation-induced oxidative damage marked by changes in mortality, morphology, antioxidant enzyme activities and the MDA and GSH content, as well as in the mRNA expression levels. Overall, this study provided helpful information about the transcriptional effects of irradiation to better understand the mechanism of carbon ion-induced oxidative stress and FA-induced radioprotective effects.

1208,"Risk of cancer associated with low-dose radiation exposure: comparison of results between the INWORKS nuclear workers study and the A-bomb survivors study. The Life Span Study (LSS) of Japanese atomic bomb survivors has served as the primary basis for estimates of radiation-related disease risks that inform radiation protection standards. The long-term follow-up of radiation-monitored nuclear workers provides estimates of radiation-cancer associations that complement findings from the LSS. Here, a comparison of radiation-cancer mortality risk estimates derived from the LSS and INWORKS, a large international nuclear worker study, is presented. Restrictions were made, so that the two study populations were similar with respect to ages and periods of exposure, leading to selection of 45,625 A-bomb survivors and 259,350 nuclear workers. For solid cancer, excess relative rates (ERR) per gray (Gy) were 0.28 (90% CI 0.18; 0.38) in the LSS, and 0.29 (90% CI 0.07; 0.53) in INWORKS. A joint analysis of the data allowed for a formal assessment of heterogeneity of the ERR per Gy across the two studies (P=0.909), with minimal evidence of curvature or of a modifying effect of attained age, age at exposure, or sex in either study. There was evidence in both cohorts of modification of the excess absolute risk (EAR) of solid cancer by attained age, with a trend of increasing EAR per Gy with attained age. For leukemia, under a simple linear model, the ERR per Gy was 2.75 (90% CI 1.73; 4.21) in the LSS and 3.15 (90% CI 1.12; 5.72) in INWORKS, with evidence of curvature in the association across the range of dose observed in the LSS but not in INWORKS; the EAR per Gy was 3.54 (90% CI 2.30; 5.05) in the LSS and 2.03 (90% CI 0.36; 4.07) in INWORKS. These findings from different study populations may help understanding of radiation risks, with INWORKS contributing information derived from cohorts of workers with protracted low dose-rate exposures.",Included

1259,"Sequence variants in cell cycle control pathway, X-ray exposure, and lung cancer risk: a multicenter case-control study in Central Europe. Exposure to ionizing radiation (IR) results in various types of DNA damage and is a suspected cause of lung cancer. An essential cellular machinery against DNA damage is cell cycle control, which is regulated by several genes, including TP53, CCND1, and CDKN2A. Therefore, we hypothesized that the genetic variants in these three genes influence the predisposition of lung cancer (i.e., CCND1 G870A, CDKN2A Ala(148)Thr, TP53 Arg(72)Pro, and 16-bp repeat in intron 3) and that the effect of X-ray on lung cancer risk can be modified by the presence of these genetic variations. The study was conducted in 15 centers in 6 countries of Central Europe between 1998 and 2002. A total of 2,238 cases and 2,289 controls were recruited and provided DNA samples. Cases with positive family history were analyzed separately. The joint effect of X-ray and previous risk genotypes was assessed, and modification by sequence variants on X-ray dose-response relationship with lung cancer risk was evaluated. We found an overall effect of TP53 intron 3 16-bp repeats [odds ratio (OR), 1.99; 95% confidence interval (95% CI), 1.27-3.13], which was stronger among cases with family history of lung cancer (OR, 2.98; 95% CI, 1.29-6.87). In addition, our results suggested an interaction that was greater than multiplicativity between TP53 intron 3 16-bp repeats and multiple X-ray exposures (interaction OR, 5.69; 95% CI, 1.33-24.3). We did not observe a main effect of CCND1 G870A polymorphism; however, the dose-response relationship between lung cancer risk and X-ray exposures was modified by CCND1 genotype with no risk from X-ray exposures among subjects who carried G/G genotype, intermediate risk [trend OR for X-ray, 1.16; 95% CI, 1.05-1.27) among subjects with G/A genotype, and highest risk [trend OR for X-ray, 1.29; 95% CI, 1.12-1.49) among subjects with A/A genotype.

BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: To quantify the late dose-related responses of the rat cervical spinal cord to X-ray irradiations by an array of microbeams or by a single millimeter beam., MATERIALS AND METHODS: Necks of anesthetized rats were irradiated transversely by an 11 mm wide array of 52 parallel, 35 mum wide, vertical X-ray microbeams, separated by 210 mum intervals between centers. Comparison was made with rats irradiated with a 1.35 mm wide single beam of similar X-rays. Rats were killed when paresis developed, or up to 383 days post irradiation (dpi)., RESULTS: Microbeam peak/valley doses of =357/12.7 Gy to 715/25.4 Gy to an 11 mm long segment of the spinal cord, or single beam doses of =146-454 Gy to a 1.35 mm long segment caused foreleg paresis and histopathologically verified spinal cord damage; rats exposed to peak/valley doses up to 253/9 Gy were paresis-free at 383 dpi., CONCLUSIONS: Whereas microbeam radiation therapy [MRT] for malignant gliomas implanted in rat brains can be safe, palliative or curative, the high tolerance of normal rat spinal cords to similar microbeam exposures justifies testing MRT for autochthonous malignancies in the central nervous system of larger animals with a view to subsequent clinical applications.

The 10 lymphoma lines included 7 previously characterized and reported in the literature. Significant differences with respect to both latency period for tumor appearance and success rate for tumor transplantation were detected among the 3 experimental groups. The unmanipulated mice were poor recipients for lymphoma heterotranplants, and tumors were produced in only two instances. In contrast, 6 tumor lines were successfully transplanted in mice inoculated with ALS, and all 10 lines were successfully transplanted in X-irradiated recipients. Although tumors were readily produced in ALS-treated and X-irradiated mice, no gross or histologic evidence of focal or distant metastases was apparent. Human lymphoblastoid cells were recultured, essentially unchanged, from the heterotransplants from 6 of 7 tumors tested. Although the tumor line HT 1460, originally from a human lymphoma, was successfully transplanted in all 3 groups, only mouse cells were recultured. The use of X-irradiation, rather than ALS, to immunosuppress nude mice offers a more standardized method for heterotransplanting human tumor cell lines and permits ready comparisons between laboratories. Furthermore X-radiation permits transplantation and subsequent study of lymphoblastoid tumors that are otherwise difficult to successfully transplant in nude mice.",Included

Objective: Incidence and mortality from ischaemic heart disease (IHD) was studied in an extended cohort of 22,377 workers first employed at the Mayak Production Association during 1948-82 and followed up to the end of 2008. Method(s): Relative risks and excess relative risks per unit dose (ERR/Gy) were calculated based on the maximum likelihood using Epicure software (Hirosoft International Corporation, Seattle, WA). Dose estimates used in analyses were provided by an updated ""Mayak Worker Dosimetry System-2008"". Result(s): A significant increasing linear trend in IHD incidence with total dose from external g-rays was observed after having adjusted for non-radiation factors and dose from internal radiation {ERR/Gy50.10 [95% confidence interval (CI): 0.04 to 0.17]}. The pure quadratic model provided a better fit of the data than did the linear one. No significant association of IHD mortality with total dose from external g-rays after having adjusted for nonradiation factors and dose from internal alpha radiation was observed in the study cohort [ERR/Gy50.06 (95% CI: ,0 to 0.15)]. A significant increasing linear trend was observed in IHD mortality with total absorbed dose from internal alpha radiation to the liver after having adjusted for non-radiation factors and dose from external g-rays in both the whole cohort [ERR/Gy50.21 (95% CI: 0.01 to 0.58)] and the subcohort of workers exposed at alpha dose ,1.00Gy [ERR/Gy51.08 (95% CI: 0.34 to 2.15)]. No association of IHD incidence with total dose from internal alpha radiation to the liver was found in the whole cohort after having adjusted for non-radiation factors and external gamma dose [ERR/Gy50.02 (95% CI: not available to 0.10)].

We have previously shown significant pathology in the heart and kidney of murine hematopoietic-acute radiation syndrome (H-ARS) survivors of 8.7-9.0 Gy total-body irradiation (TBI). The goal of this study was to determine temporal relationships in the development of vasculopathy and the progression of renal and cardiovascular delayed effects of acute radiation exposure (DEARE) at TBI doses less than 9 Gy and to elucidate the potential roles of senescence, inflammation and oxidative stress. Our results show significant loss of endothelial cells in coronary arteries by 4 months post-TBI (8.53 or 8.72 Gy of gamma radiation). This loss precedes renal dysfunction and interstitial fibrosis and progresses to abnormalities in the arterial media and adventitia and loss of coronary arterioles. Major differences in radiation-induced pathobiology exist between the heart and kidney in terms of vasculopathy progression and also in indices of inflammation, senescence and oxidative imbalance. The results of this work suggest a need for different medical countermeasures for multiple targets in different organs and at various times after acute radiation injury to prevent the progression of DEARE.",Included

BACKGROUND: We reviewed the disease control and complications of the treatment of sacrococcygeal chordoma from four tertiary cancer centers with emphasis on the effects of radiotherapy in surgically treated patients., METHODS: A total of 193 patients with primary sacrococcygeal chordoma from 1990 to 2015 were reviewed. There were 124 males, with a mean age of 59 +/- 15 years and a mean follow-up of 7 +/- 4 years. Eighty-nine patients received radiotherapy with a mean total dose of 61.8 +/- 10.9 Gy., RESULTS: The 10-year disease-free and disease-specific survival was 58% and 72%, respectively. Radiation was not associated with local recurrence (hazard ratio [HR], 1.13; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.59-2.17; P = 0.71), metastases (HR, 0.93; 95% CI, 0.45-1.91; P = 0.85) or disease-specific survival (HR, 0.96; 95% CI, 0.46-2.00; P = 0.91). Higher doses (>=70 Gy; HR, 0.52; 95% CI, 0.20-1.32; P = 0.17) may be associated with reduced local recurrence. Radiotherapy was associated with wound complications (HR, 2.76; 95% CI, 1.64-4.82;, P < 0.001) and sacral stress fractures (HR, 4.73; 95% CI, 1.88-14.38; P < 0.001)., CONCLUSIONS: In this multicenter review, radiotherapy was not associated with tumor outcome but associated with complications. The routine use of radiotherapy with en-bloc resection of sacrococcygeal chordomas should be reconsidered in favor of a selective, individualized approach with a radiation dose of >=70 Gy.

Traditionally, the dicentric chromosome assay (DCA) has been used to derive biological dose estimates for unknown radiological exposures. While sensitive, this assay requires highly trained evaluators and is extremely time consuming. The cytokinesis-block micronucleus (CBMN) assay has been suggested as an alternative to the DCA, as it is much faster to evaluate samples and requires less technical expertise. In order to validate this assay for triage biodosimetry, dose-response curves were generated for six donors at eight doses of gamma-radiation (0-4.0 Gy). Each sample was evaluated by 12 individuals, among three different laboratories and the incidence of micronuclei was determined after counting 50-500 binucleated cells. This study demonstrated that the CBMN assay was capable of detecting radiation doses >or=1 Gy after scoring only 200 binucleated cells. As such, the CBMN assay may provide a sensitive and reliable technique for deployment as an initial screening tool in a large-scale radiological emergency where large numbers of biological dose estimates are required.",Included

PURPOSE: To investigate within the framework of a multilaboratory study the suitability of FISH chromosome painting to measure so-called stable translocations in peripheral lymphocytes of Mayak nuclear-industrial workers (from the Southern Urals) and their use for retrospective biodosimetry., MATERIALS AND METHODS: Chromosime analyses were carried out from 69 workers who had received protracted occupational radiation exposures (0.012-6.065 Gy) up to approximately 40 years before blood sampling. Twenty-one unexposed people living in the same area were controls. A multicolour FISH-painting protocol with the target chromosomes 1, 4 and 8 simultaneously with a pancentromeric probe was used to score potentially transmissible chromosome-type aberrations (reciprocal translocations 2B and related 'one-way' patterns I-III according to the S&S classification)., RESULTS: Individual biodosimetry estimates were obtained in terms of these potentially long-term surviving aberration types based on the linear component of a low dose-rate gamma-ray calibration curve produced using identical staining and scoring protocols. For comparison, the workers personal and total background doses were converted to red bone marrow doses. The estimated doses were mainly lower than would be predicted by the calibration curve, particularly at accumulated higher dose levels., CONCLUSIONS: Owing to the limited life-time of circulating T-lymphocytes, the long-term persistence of translocations in vivo requires the assumption of a clonal repopulation of these naturally senescing cells from the haemopoietic stem cell compartments. Obviously such a replacement cannot be fully achieved, leading to a temporal decline even of the yield of transmissible aberrations types. Assuming further a highly selective capacity of stem cells against any type of chromosomal damage and the fact that one must rely on partial genome findings, the potential of FISH chromosome painting for retrospective dose reconstruction is probably limited to a decade or so after high-level protracted radiation exposure.",Included

Background: Studies of workers at the plutonium production factory in Hanford, WA have led to conflicting conclusions about the role of age at exposure as a modifier of associations between ionising radiation and cancer. Aim(s): To evaluate the influence of age at exposure on radiation risk estimates in an updated follow up of Hanford workers. Method(s): A cohort of 26 389 workers hired between 1944 and 1978 was followed through 1994 to ascertain vital status and causes of death. External radiation dose estimates were derived from personal dosimeters. Poisson regression was used to estimate associations between mortality and cumulative external radiation dose at all ages, and in specific age ranges. Result(s): A total of 8153 deaths were identified, 2265 of which included cancer as an underlying or contributory cause. Estimates of the excess relative risk per Sievert (ERR/Sv) for cumulative radiation doses at all ages combined were negative for all cause and leukaemia and positive for all cancer and lung cancer. Cumulative doses accrued at ages below 35, 35-44, and 45-54 showed little association with mortality. For cumulative dose accrued at ages 55 and above (10 year lag), the estimated ERR/Sv for all cancers was 3.24 (90% CI: 0.80 to 6.17), primarily due to an association with lung cancer (ERR/Sv. 9.05, 90% CI: 2.96 to 17.92). Conclusion(s): Associations between radiation and cancer mortality in this cohort are primarily a function of doses at older ages and deaths from lung cancer. The association of older age radiation exposures and cancer mortality is similar to observations from several other occupational studies.",Included

1367,"Long term effects of radiation exposure on telomere lengths of leukocytes and its associated biomarkers among atomic-bomb survivors. Ionizing radiation (IR) is a major source of cellular damage and the immediate cellular response to IR has been well characterized. But the long-term impact of IR on cell function and its relationship with aging are not known. Here, we examined the IR effects on telomere length and other biomarkers 50 to 68 years post-exposure (two time points per person) in survivors of the atomic bombing at Hiroshima during WWII. We found that telomere length of leukocytes was inversely correlated with the dose of IR (p=0.008), and this effect was primarily found in survivors who were exposed at younger ages; specifically those <12 years old (p=0.0004). Although a dose-related retardation of telomere shortening with age was observed in the cross-sectional data, longitudinal follow-up after 11 years did not show IR exposure-related alteration of the rate of telomere shortening with age. In addition, IR diminished the associations between telomere length and selected aging biomarkers that were observed in survivors with no dose. These included uric acid metabolism, cytokines, and blood T cell counts. These findings showed long-lasting detrimental effects of IR on telomere length of leukocytes in both dose- and age-at-exposure dependent manner, and on alterations of biomarkers with aging.",Included
1369,"Nucleoid sedimentation analysis of DNA superstructure, gamma-radiation-induced damage and repair in human and chacma baboon (Papia ursinus) peripheral lymphocytes. The use of the chacma baboon (Papio ursinus) in radiobiological investigations justifies special attention because it answers many of the criteria of parallelism to the human. The present study was undertaken to establish whether in vitro gamma-radiation effects in chacma baboon and human lymphocytes are comparable. The sensitive and rapid nucleoid sedimentation technique was employed to evaluate in vitro DNA superstructure, damage and repair in readily obtainable radiosensitive peripheral lymphocytes. Dose-response curves after 60Co gamma-irradiation were obtained, and by applying single-hit kinetics of the target theory, an estimation of molecular masses of the supercoiled domains was made. The baboon and human lymphocytes produced analogous results, while an ethidium bromide intercalation study also revealed a similarity in average DNA superhelical density. Lymphocyte DNA repair after 0.5-4.0 Gy gamma-irradiation and repair times from 0.5 to 5.0 h were evaluated. The repair data obtained from baboon and human cells after 2.0 Gy irradiation compared favourably in extent of DNA repair as well as the profiles of the kinetic curves. These findings indicate that the chacma baboon would be a useful and relevant model for further in vivo radiobiological studies on lymphocytes. The effects of sedimentation conditions and advantages of using vertical-tube rotors in the nucleoid sedimentation technique are also discussed.",Included

This study evaluated cancer risk for adult residents near Nuclear Power Plants (NPPs) in Korea through a valid prospective cohort study during 1992-2010. The study cohort was composed of 11,367 adults living within a five km radius from the NPPs for the exposed and 24,809 adults for the non-exposed or reference cohort set at two different levels of proximity; 5-30 km radius and more than 30 km radius away from NPPs. In 303,542.5 person-years of follow-up, a total of 2,298 cancer cases of all sites, or 1,377 radio-inducible cancers diagnosed during 1992-2008 were ascertained. Multiple adjusted hazard ratios and 95% confidence intervals were estimated using multivariate Cox proportional hazard model. There were no epidemiological evidence for increased risk of cancer due to radiation from NPPs. Radiological study results or surveillance data of radiation doses around NPPs could be well documented for risk estimation of radio-inducible cancers, instead of epidemiological study results of the long-time required. Continuous surveillance of quantitative measures of dose levels around NPPs and radiation exposures to the residents is warranted.",Included

The study aim was to determine the risk of cataract among radiologic technologists with respect to occupational and nonoccupational exposures to ionizing radiation and to personal characteristics. A prospective cohort of 35,705 cataract-free US radiologic technologists aged 24-44 years was followed for nearly 20 years (1983-2004) by using two follow-up questionnaires. During the study period, 2,382 cataracts and 647 cataract extractions were reported. Cigarette smoking for >or=5 pack-years; body mass index of >or=25 kg/m(2); and history of diabetes, hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, or arthritis at baseline were significantly (p or=3 x-rays to the face/neck was associated with a hazard ratio of cataract of 1.25 (95% confidence interval: 1.06, 1.47).

Findings challenge the National Council on Radiation Protection and International Commission on Radiological Protection assumptions that the lowest cumulative ionizing radiation dose to the lens of the eye that can produce a progressive cataract is approximately 2 Gy, and they support the hypothesis that the lowest cataractogenic dose in humans is substantially less than previously thought.",Included

Little information is available on the health effects of exposures to fallout from Soviet nuclear weapons testing and on the combined external and internal environmental exposures that have resulted from these tests. This paper reports the first analysis of the Semipalatinsk historical cohort exposed in the vicinity of the Semipalatinsk nuclear test site, Kazakhstan. The cohort study, which includes 19,545 inhabitants of exposed and comparison villages of the Semipalatinsk region, was set up in the 1960s and comprises 582,750 person-years of follow-up between 1960 and 1999. Cumulative effective radiation dose estimates in this cohort range from 20 mSv to approximately 4 Sv. Rates of mortality and cancer mortality in the exposed group substantially exceeded those of the comparison group. Dose-response analyses within the exposed group confirmed a significant trend with dose for all solid cancers (P < 0.0001) and for digestive and respiratory cancers (P = 0.0255 and P < 0.0001), whereas no consistent dose-response trend was found for all causes of death (P = 0.4296). Regarding specific cancer sites, a significant trend with dose was observed for lung cancer (P = 0.0001), stomach cancer (P = 0.0050), and female breast cancer (P = 0.0040) as well as for esophagus cancer in women (P = 0.0030). The excess relative risk per sievert for all solid cancers combined was 1.77 (1.35; 2.27) based on the total cohort data, yet a selection bias regarding the comparison group could not be entirely ruled out. The excess relative risk per sievert based on the cohort's exposed group was 0.81 (0.46; 1.33) for all solid cancers combined and thus still exceeds current risk estimates from the Life Span Study. Future epidemiological assessments based on this cohort will benefit from extension of follow-up and ongoing validation of dosimetric data.",Included

Interventional radiology unit workers represent one of the occupationally most exposed populations to low-dose ionizing radiation. Since there are many uncertainties in research of doses below 100 mSv, this study attempted to evaluate DNA damage levels in chronically exposed personnel. The study group consisted of 24 subjects matched with a control population by the number of participants, age, gender ratio, active smoking status, the period of blood sampling, and residence. Based on regular dosimetry using thermoluminiscent dosimeters, our study group occupationally received a dose of 1.82 +/- 3.60 mSv over the last year. The results of the cytokinesis-block micronucleus assay and the comet assay showed a higher nuclear buds frequency (4.09 +/- 1.88) and tail length (15.46 +/- 1.47 mum) than in the control group (2.96 +/- 1.67, 14.05 +/- 1.36 mum, respectively). Differences in other descriptors from both tests did not reach statistical significance.

Background: Osseous cyst echinococcosis (CE) is an infectious disease that causes disability and deformity in patients, yet there is still no satisfactory treatment. Focusing on the feasibility and prognosis of radiotherapy as an adjuvant or palliative treatment for osseous CE, this study investigated the outcome of Meriones meridianus with osseous CE after radiotherapy., Methods: The study utilized a comparison control group design with three groups of gerbils, and 240 osseous CE gerbils were randomly divided into control, 40Gy/5times, and 50Gy/5times groups. Different doses of radiotherapy were given to the gerbils, and then, the effects of radiotherapy on gerbils and lesions were observed at 3 and 6 months after radiotherapy. Statistical analysis was done using chi 2 test, unpaired t-test, and one-way ANOVA., Results: Significant changes (P < 0.05) were achieved between the three groups in terms of seven parameters at 3 and 6 months, including the number of dead gerbils and lesion sites with ulceration and infection, number of dead scolices, protein content, Ca2+ concentration, the maximum diameter of lesion site, and wet weight of cysts. Except for the number of dead gerbils and lesion sites with ulceration and infection, all other parameters were observed a big difference between 3 months and 6 months in the 50Gy/5times group., Conclusion: Radiotherapy at a dose of 50 Gy has inhibitory and therapeutic effects on osseous CE in gerbils, and radiotherapy could probably be a treatment option for persistent or recurrent osseous CE.

The number of splenic rosette-forming cells (RFC) in the intact spleen was very low but greatly increased after sublethal whole body x-irradiation. These cells were inhibited by pretreatment of the cells with AKR anti-C3H- antigen antiserum, in the presence of fresh guinea pig serum, but not with rabbit anti-mouse immunoglobulin antiserum. The splenic RFC also increased after cortisone acetate administration into mice. These results suggest that the RFC are a T cell sub-population having x-ray resistant and cortisone-insensitive characteristics. The x-irradiation of mice in vivo selectively increased the number of splenic RFC in consequence of reduction in the number of cells having non-T cell characteristics. These RFC are presumably antigen-specific sheep red blood cell rosettes, a quite different situation as in the case of human T lymphocyte rosette formation.",Included

1565,"Rapid detection of radiation-induced chromosomal aberrations in lymphocytes and hematopoietic progenitor cells by mFISH. Structural chromosome aberrations (SCAs) are sensitive indicators of a preceding exposure of the hematopoietic system to ionizing radiation. Cytogenetic investigations have therefore become routine tools for an assessment of absorbed radiation doses and their biological effects after occupational exposure or radiation accidents.Due to its speed and ease of use, fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) with whole chromosome painting (WCP) probes has become a method of choice to visualize SCAs. Until recently, this technique was limited to a rather small number of chromosomes, which could be tested simultaneously. As a result, only a fraction of the structural aberrations present in a sample could be detected and the overall dose effect had to be calculated by extrapolation. The recent introduction of two genome-wide screening techniques in tumor research, i.e., Spectral Karyotyping (SKY) and multicolor FISH (mFISH) now allows the detection of translocations involving any two non-homologous chromosomes.The present study was prompted by our desire to bring the power of mFISH to bear for the rapid identification of radiation-induced SCAs. We chose two model systems to investigate the utility of mFISH: lymphocytes that were exposed in vitro to 3 Gy photons and single hematopoietic progenitor cell colonies isolated from a Chernobyl victim 9 years after in vivo exposure to 5.4 Sv.In lymphocytes, we found up to 15 different chromosomes involved in rearrangements indicating complex radiation effects. Stable aberrations detected in hematopoietic cell colonies, on the other hand, showed involvement of up to three different chromosomes. These results demonstrated that mFISH is a rapid and powerful approach to detect and characterize radiation-induced SCAs in the hemopoietic system. The application of mFISH is expected to result in a more detailed and, thus, more informative picture of radiation effects. Eventually, this technique will allow researchers to rapidly delineate chromosomal breakpoints and facilitate the identification of the genes involved in radiation tumorigenesis.

1574,"Polymorphisms of DNA damage response genes in radiation-related and sporadic papillary thyroid carcinoma. Papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC) etiologically occurs as a radiation-induced or sporadic malignancy. Genetic factors contributing to the susceptibility to either form remain unknown. In this retrospective case-control study, we evaluated possible associations between single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the candidate DNA damage response genes (ATM, XRCC1, TP53, XRCC3, MTF1) and risk of radiation-induced and sporadic PTC. A total of 255 PTC cases (123 Chernobyl radiation-induced and 132 sporadic, all in Caucasians) and 596 healthy controls (198 residents of Chernobyl areas and 398 subjects without history of radiation exposure, all Caucasians) were genotyped. The risk of PTC and SNPs interactions with radiation exposure were assessed by logistic regressions. The ATM G5557A and XRCC1 Arg399Gln polymorphisms, regardless of radiation exposure, associated with a decreased risk of PTC according to the multiplicative and dominant models of inheritance (odds ratio (OR) = 0.69, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.45-0.86 and OR = 0.70, 95% CI 0.59-0.93 respectively). The ATM IVS22-77 T > C and TP53 Arg72Pro SNPs interacted with radiation (P = 0.04 and P = 0.01 respectively). ATM IVS22-77 associated with the increased risk of sporadic PTC (OR = 1.84, 95% CI 1.10-3.24) whereas TP53 Arg72Pro correlated with the higher risk of radiogenic PTC (OR = 1.80, 95% CI 1.06-2.36).

The GG/CC/GG/GG genotype displayed a significantly increased risk for sporadic PTC (OR = 3.32, 95% CI 1.57-6.99).

Analysis of the loss of heterozygosity at the D5Mit143 locus was done for thymic lymphlomas induced by gamma-irradiation of mice from two reciprocal backcrosses (BALB/c x CcS-13)F1 x BALB/c and (BALB/c x CcS-13)F1 x CcS-13. BALB/c mice are susceptible to gamma-ray induction of lymphomas. The CcS-13 strain is one of 20 CcS/Dcm (CcS) series of recombinant congenic strains, and the CcS-13 mice are resistant to gamma-radiation-induced lymphomas [1, 8]. Our preliminary tests show 50% (6/12) frequency of allelic loss at the D5Mit143 locus in thymic lymphomas induced by gamma-irradiation of the mice from (BALB/c x CcS-13)F1 x BALB/c backcross. Yet, in gamma-radiation-induced lymphomas from the backcross made in opposite direction, namely, (BALB/c x CcS-13)F1 x CcS-13, the analysis with the DSMit143 marker revealed low incidence of the loss of heterozygosity, 6.7% (15). The D5Mit143 locus resides in the distal part of chromosome 5, close to the telomere. Allelic loss of heterozygosity at the D5Mit143 locus showed strain specificity.

Mitochondrial DNA heteroplasmy using the protein-coding cytochrome b (Mtcyb) gene was assessed in laboratory mice (C57BL/6 and BALB/c) exposed to the Chernobyl environment. Subacute to subchronic (30-40 days) exposure resulted in a cumulative radiation dose of 1.2-1.6 Gy ( approximately 0.04 Gy/day). Mice were sampled prior to introduction into the enclosures and again after removal from the enclosures. Nucleotide variation (site heteroplasmy) in 306 pre-exposure Mtcyb gene copies (122400 base pairs) was compared to variation in 354 postexposure gene copies (141600 base pairs). Five mutant copies, each characterized by a single nucleotide substitution, were observed (four in the pre-exposure samples, one in a postexposure sample). The frequencies of mutant gene copies and nucleotide substitutions in pre-exposure and postexposure samples were not significantly different. This suggests that this type of exposure (i.e. low dose rate) does not pose a significant mutation risk to the Mtcyb gene in digit tissue. Furthermore, no significant radiation risk to analogous human tissues may exist when occupational exposures involve low dose rates such as these. Finally, linear, cumulative models of genetic risk currently used to estimate radiation-induced effects are likely to be inappropriate for low-dose-rate exposures and need to be re-evaluated critically.",Included

Objectives To determine cancer mortality compared with the general population and to examine dose-response relationships between cumulative occupational radiation dose and specific cancer outcomes in the German aircrew cohort. Methods For a cohort of 26 846 aircrew personnel, standardised mortality ratios (SMR) were calculated. Dose-response analyses were carried out using Poisson regression to assess dose-related cancer risks for the period 1960-2014. Exposure assessment comprises recently available dose register data for all cohort members and newly estimated retrospective cabin crew doses for 1960-2003. Results SMR for all-cause, specific cancer groups and most individual cancers were reduced in all aircrew groups. The only increases were seen for brain cancer in pilots (n=23, SMR 2.01, 95% CI 1.15 to 3.28) and for malignant melanoma (n=10, SMR 1.88, 95% CI 0.78 to 3.85). Breast cancer mortality among female cabin crew was similar to the general population (n=71, SMR 1.06, 95% CI 0.77 to 1.44). Overall median cumulative effective dose was 34.2 mSv (max: 116 mSv) for 1960-2014. No dose-response associations were seen in any of the models. For brain cancer, relative risks were elevated across dose categories. An indicative negative trend with increasing dose category was seen for large intestine cancer in female cabin crew (n=23). Conclusions There was no evidence for significant dose-response patterns for the considered cancer types. Interpretation of results remains difficult as cumulative dose is closely related to age. Future work should focus on investigating radiation jointly with other risk factors that may contribute to risks for specific cancers among aircrew.Copyright © Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2020.

A 20,000 g pellet obtained from the homogenate of CD1 mouse spleen cells has measurable peroxidase and bactericidal activities. Whole body x-irradiation stimulates the in vitro peroxidative and bactericidal activities of the spleen cells. These cells do not phagocytize. However, addition of polystyrene latex particles to spleen cells from non- or x-irradiated mice, increases glucose oxidation. The extent of this stimulation (three- to fourfold) is less than that of PMN (six- to tenfold). Interaction between particles and lymphocyte surface may be the cause of this stimulation. The increased bactericidal activity due to x-ray is attributed mainly to an increase in the peroxidase activity of the lymphocytes. Surface (membrane) action rather than phagocytosis may be involved in the bactericidal process. The spleen lymphocyte peroxidase is distinct from myeloperoxidase in several respects.",Included
1682,"Reduction of Delayed Homologous Recombination by Induction of Radioadaptive Response in RaDR-GFP Mice (Yonezawa Effect): An Old Player With a New Role. Radiotherapy (RT) treats cancer effectively with high doses of ionizing radiation (IR) to killing cancer cells and shrinking tumors while bearing the risk of developing different side effects, including secondary cancer, which is most concerning for long-term health consequences. Genomic instability (GI) is a characteristic of most cancer cells, and IR-induced GI can manifest as delayed homologous recombination (HR). Radioadaptive response (RAR) is capable of reducing genotoxicity, cell transformation, mutation, and carcinogenesis, but the rational evidence describing its contributions to the reduction of radiation risk, in particular, carcinogenesis, remains fragmented. In this work, to investigate the impact of RAR on high-dose, IR-induced GI measured as delayed HR, the frequency of recombinant cells was comparatively studied under RAR-inducible and -uninducible conditions in the nucleated cells in hematopoietic tissues (bone marrow and spleen) using the Rosa26 Direct Repeat-green fluorescent protein (RaDR-GFP) homozygote mice. Results demonstrated that the frequency of recombinant cells was significantly lower in hematopoietic tissues under RAR-inducible condition. These findings suggest that reduction in delayed HR may be at least a part of the mechanisms underlying decreased carcinogenesis by RAR, and application of RAR would contribute to a more rigorous and scientifically grounded system of radiation protection in RT.Copyright © The Author(s) 2019.",Included

1705,"Projected lifetime cancer risks from occupational radiation exposure among diagnostic medical radiation workers in South Korea. BACKGROUND: Timely assessment of cancer risk from current radiation exposure among medical radiation workers can contribute to the development of strategies to prevent excessive occupational radiation exposure. The purpose of the present study is to estimate the lifetime risk of cancers induced by occupational radiation exposure among medical radiation workers., METHODS: Using estimated organ doses and the RadRAT risk assessment tool, the lifetime cancer risk was estimated among medical radiation workers who were enrolled in the Korean National Dose Registry from 1996 to 2011. Median doses were used for estimating the risk because of the skewed distribution of radiation doses. Realistic representative exposure scenarios in the study population based on sex, job start year, and occupational group were created for calculating the lifetime attributable risk (LAR) and lifetime fractional risk (LFR)., RESULTS: The mean estimated lifetime cancer risk from occupational radiation exposure varied significantly by sex and occupational group. The highest LAR was observed in male and female radiologic technologists who started work in 1991 (264.4/100,000 and 391.2/100,000, respectively). Female workers had a higher risk of radiation-related excess cancer, although they were exposed to lower radiation doses than male workers. The higher LAR among women was attributable primarily to excess breast and thyroid cancer risks. LARs among men were higher than women in most other cancer sites. With respect to organ sites, LAR of colon cancer (44.3/100,000) was the highest in male radiologic technologists, whereas LAR of thyroid cancer (222.0/100,000) was the highest in female radiologic technologists among workers who started radiologic practice in 1991. Thyroid and bladder cancers had the highest LFR among radiologic technologists., CONCLUSIONS: Our findings provide an assessment of the potential cancer risk from occupational radiation exposure among medical radiation workers, based on current knowledge about radiation risk. Although the radiation-related risk was small in most cases, it varied widely by sex and occupational group, and the risk would be underestimated due to the use of median, rather than mean, doses. Therefore, careful monitoring is necessary to optimize radiation doses and protect medical radiation workers from potential health risks, particularly female radiologic technologists.",Included

We evaluated the influence of body mass index (BMI) and height on radiation-associated colon cancer risk using Poisson regression., RESULTS: We observed a similar linear dose-response relationship for the 56,064 subjects included in our analysis and the entire cohort of Japanese atomic bomb survivors [excess relative risk (ERR) per Gray (Gy) = 0.53, 95 % confidence interval (CI) 0.25-0.86]. Elevation in earliest reported BMI, BMI reported closest to colon cancer diagnosis, and time-varying BMI were associated with an elevated risk of colon cancer [relative risk (RR) per 5 kg/m(2) increase in BMI = 1.14, 95 % CI 1.03-1.26; RR = 1.16, 95 % CI 1.05-1.27; and RR = 1.15, 95 % CI 1.04-1.27, respectively]. Height was not significantly related to colon cancer risk. Inclusion of anthropometric variables in models had little impact on radiation risk estimates, and there was no evidence that sensitivity to the effect of radiation on colon cancer risk depended on BMI., CONCLUSIONS: Radiation exposure and BMI are both risk factors for colon cancer. BMI at various times after exposure to the atomic bombings does not significantly influence the relationship between radiation dose and colon cancer risk, suggesting that BMI and radiation impact colon cancer risk independently of each other.",Included

This study did not reveal harmful effects of exposure to low levels of radioactivity. On the contrary, stress present in the above-background area may serve to enhance cellular defense mechanisms.

1750,"Chernobyl birds have smaller brains. BACKGROUND: Animals living in areas contaminated by radioactive material from Chernobyl suffer from increased oxidative stress and low levels of antioxidants. Therefore, normal development of the nervous system is jeopardized as reflected by high frequencies of developmental errors, reduced brain size and impaired cognitive abilities in humans. Alternatively, associations between psychological effects and radiation have been attributed to post-traumatic stress in humans., METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDING: Here we used an extensive sample of 550 birds belonging to 48 species to test the prediction that even in the absence of post-traumatic stress, there is a negative association between relative brain size and level of background radiation. We found a negative association between brain size as reflected by external head volume and level of background radiation, independent of structural body size and body mass. The observed reduction in brain size in relation to background radiation amounted to 5% across the range of almost a factor 5,000 in radiation level. Species differed significantly in reduction in brain size with increasing background radiation, and brain size was the only morphological character that showed a negative relationship with radiation. Brain size was significantly smaller in yearlings than in older individuals., CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Low dose radiation can have significant effects on normal brain development as reflected by brain size and therefore potentially cognitive ability. The fact that brain size was smaller in yearlings than in older individuals implies that there was significant directional selection on brain size with individuals with larger brains experiencing a viability advantage.",Included
1753,"Cytogenetic responses to G2 phase X-irradiation of cells from retinoblastoma patients. Fibroblast cell lines from 20 retinoblastoma (RB) patients with the hereditary bilateral form of disease compared with 16 lines from normal donors had a significantly higher chromatid aberration frequency (CAF), and more displaced and nondisplaced breaks per 100 metaphase cells after x- irradiation during the G2 phase of the cell cycle. The mean CAF was 39 +/- 1.0, range 30-46, for cells from normal subjects, compared to a mean of 245.6, range 101-506, for cells from hereditary RB patients (p < 10-6). Of fibroblast lines from eight patients with unilateral RB, four had a CAF comparable to that of lines from normal donors (< 60) and four had a high CAF (> 130), resembling that of hereditary forms; two of the latter four lines were from patients with familial or deletion 13 forms of RB. Furthermore, in two families, PHA-stimulated blood lymphocytes from RB patients, one bilateral and one unilateral, and from certain unaffected first-degree relatives after G2 phase X-irradiation had a high CAF (>= 110) compared to a CAF (>= 53) of cells from three normal donors sampled at the same time. These results were shown not to be related to differences in cell cycle progression or initial extent of chromatid damage. The results suggest that the high frequency of chromatid aberrations in the cells from hereditary RB patients results from a genetic deficiency in DNA repair.",Included

The objective of this study was to examine if individuals living near a uranium processing site have greater mutagenic damage, as measured by three mutagenicity assays, compared with subjects unexposed to any nuclear facilities. The design was a cross-sectional exploratory analysis of 112 subjects; 56 volunteer residents were from within a 5-mile radius of the Fernald Uranium Processing site and 56 'control' subjects were from a geographically separate area unexposed to any known uranium emissions. The groups were constrained to be similar in age and sex composition. The main outcome measures were three human somatic gene mutation assays consisting of the HPRT T-lymphocyte cloning assay to measure 6-thioguanine resistant lymphocytes; the glycophorin A assay to detect the loss of expression of the M or N allele; and the micronucleus assay as a marker of chromosomal damage. The results showed no statistically significant or quantitatively important differences between groups for all three mutagenicity assays; only the unselected cloning efficiency was statistically significantly different between groups (0.42 +/- 0.16 for the Fernald versus 0.35 +/- 0.12 for the comparison groups). In both groups, age was significantly related to HPRT mutant frequency, with a 1.25% rate of increase in mutant frequencies for each 1-year gain of age in the Fernald group and a 1.12% rate of increase in mutant frequencies for each 1-year gain of age in the comparison group. For the micronucleus data, females had a greater mean micronucleus frequency than males. In addition, smokers had an increased mean ln (natural logarithm) HPRT mutant frequency (3.06 +/- 0.14 for current smokers compared with a mean of 2.72 +/- 0.05 for non-current (i.e. never plus former) smokers). Our results are consistent with the previously reported association between sex type and micronucleus frequency, the known relationship between age and T-lymphocyte cloning efficiency and age and HPRT mutant frequency, and verify the wide inter-subject variability for the latter. Finally, we conclude that at a population level, the relationships between current cigarette use and HPRT mutant frequency, and sex type and micronucleus frequency, are stronger than is the association between geographic proximity to a uranium processing site and mutagenic abnormalities.",Included

1769,"The risk of cataractogenesis after gamma knife radiosurgery: a nationwide population based case-control study. BACKGROUND: Medical radiation is considered a factor responsible for cataractogenesis. However, the incidence of this ophthalmologic complication resulting from gamma knife radiosurgery (GKRS) has not yet been reported. The present study aimed to determine the risk of cataractogenesis associated with radiation exposure from GKRS., METHODS: This study used information from a random sample of one million persons enrolled in the nationally representative Taiwan National Health Insurance Research Database. The GK group consisted of patients who underwent GKRS between 2000 and 2009. The non-GK group was composed of subjects who had never undergone GKRS, but who were matched with the case group for time of enrollment, age, sex, history of coronary artery disease, hypertension, and diabetes., RESULTS: There were 277 patients in the GK group and 2770 matched subjects in the non-GK group. The GK group had a higher overall incidence of cataracts (10.11% vs. 7.26%; crude hazard ratio [cHR], 1.59; 95% CI, 1.07-2.36; adjusted hazard ratio [aHR], 1.25; 95% CI, 0.82-1.90) than the non-GK group. Patients who had undergone computed tomography and/or cerebral angiography (CT/angio) studies had a higher risk of developing cataracts than those who did not (10.82% vs. 6.64%; cHR, 1.74; 95% CI, 1.31-2.30; aHR, 1.65; 95% CI, 1.22-2.23). The age group between 30 and 50 years had the highest risk of cataractogenesis in both the GK and CT/angio groups (cHR, 3.50; 95% CI, 1.58-7.72; aHR, 2.43; 95% CI, 1.02-5.81; cHR, 2.96; 95% CI, 1.47-5.99; aHR, 2.27; 95% CI, 1.05-4.93, respectively)., CONCLUSIONS: Radiation exposure due to GKRS and CT/angio study may be independently associated with increased risk of cataractogenesis. We suggest routine dosimetry measurement of eye lens and proper protection for patients with benign lesions during GKRS. Regular follow-up imaging studies should avoid the use of CT/angio, and particular care should be taken in the 30-50-year-old age group, due to their significantly increased risk of cataract formation.",Included

The median interval between the completion of radiotherapy and the evaluation of neuropsychological function was 1.7 years. Groups were matched for age and educational level. The results showed that our NPC group with radiotherapy had neuropsychological impairments in the areas of auditory attention/concentration, immediate and delayed verbal recall and immediate visual recall, and recent memory, higher-order visuospatial abilities, and bimanual dexterity. Thus neuropsychological dysfunction may occur in patients with NPC within the first 2 years after radiotherapy.",Included
1841,"Decrease of respiratory burst in neutrophils of patients with ankylosing spondylitis by combined radon-hyperthermia treatment. OBJECTIVE: To define the respiratory burst activity of neutrophils, the total anti-oxidative status of plasma, and the parameters of systemic inflammation in patients with ankylosing spondylitis (AS) before and after a combined radon-hyperthermia treatment in the thermal tunnels of Bockstein-Bad Gastein in Austria., METHODS: In 20 patients with AS the effects of a total of 15 hours of radon-hyperthermia-treatment spread over a period of three weeks were studied. The respiratory burst activity of neutrophils was measured fluorometrically using dichlorofluorescein diacetate, the total anti-oxidant status was measured using azinodiethyl-benzthiazoline-sulphonate, and inflammation parameters were determined by routine laboratory assays., RESULTS: Before treatment, the basal neutrophil respiratory burst in patients (n = 20) was 409 +/- 62 fluorescence arbitrary units (AU; mean +/- SEM) and 359 +/- 37 AU in controls (n = 9; p > 0.5); the stimulated respiratory burst (fMet-Leu-Phe, 10(-6) M) was 1,027 +/- 133 AU in patients and 1,152 +/- 218 AU in controls (p > 0.5). After treatment, the basal neutrophil respiratory burst in patients (n = 19) was 137 +/- 16 and in controls it was 174 +/- 35 AU (n = 8; p > 0.1); the stimulated respiratory burst was 670 +/- 66 and 1,305 +/- 82 AU, in patients and controls respectively (p < 0.001). No effects of treatment on the total anti-oxidant status of the plasma or on the parameters of inflammation were detected., CONCLUSION: Combined radon-hyperthermia treatment reduces the respiratory burst activity of the blood circulating neutrophils in patients with AS. If respiratory burst activity from the neutrophils plays a role in the pathophysiology of ankylosing spondylitis, the observed reduction may be related to the beneficial effects of radon-hyperthermia treatment.",Included

The control animals were sham radiated but were otherwise treated identically as those of the experimental groups. Blood samples were taken by cardiac puncture before radiation and 30 min after each exposure of 150 rads. The red cells were re-suspended in their own plasma and HMP pathway activity was measured in the suspension. The pathway activity showed a consistent but minor reduction in the experimental group, which became statistically significant after the total dose of 750 rads (P less than 0.020). In a separate study the changes induced by ionizing radiation in the erythrocyte enzyme NADH-methemoglobin reductase were measured using the same experimental protocol. The enzyme activity in the red cells of the experimental group varied between 34.90 +/- 2.17 to 161.95 +/- 5.34 I.U./ml erythrocyte pack.

1891,"Radiation- and Age-Associated Changes in Peripheral Blood Dendritic Cell Populations among Aging Atomic Bomb Survivors in Japan. Previous immunological studies in atomic bomb survivors have suggested that radiation exposure leads to long-lasting changes, similar to immunological aging observed in T-cell-adaptive immunity. However, to our knowledge, late effects of radiation on dendritic cells (DCs), the key coordinators for activation and differentiation of T cells, have not yet been investigated in humans. In the current study, we hypothesized that numerical and functional decreases would be observed in relationship to radiation dose in circulating conventional DCs (cDCs) and plasmacytoid DCs (pDCs) among 229 Japanese A-bomb survivors. Overall, the evidence did not support this hypothesis, with no overall changes in DCs or functional changes observed with radiation dose. Multivariable regression analysis for radiation dose, age and gender effects revealed that total DC counts as well as subpopulation counts decreased in relationship to increasing age. Further analyses revealed that in women, absolute numbers of pDCs showed significant decreases with radiation dose. A hierarchical clustering analysis of gene expression profiles in DCs after Toll-like receptor stimulation in vitro identified two clusters of participants that differed in age-associated expression levels of genes involved in antigen presentation and cytokine/chemokine production in cDCs. These results suggest that DC counts decrease and expression levels of gene clusters change with age. More than 60 years after radiation exposure, we also observed changes in pDC counts associated with radiation, but only among women.",Included
1901,"Impact of chemical exposure on cancer mortality in a French cohort of uranium processing workers. BACKGROUND: Nuclear workers may be exposed to a variety of chemical hazards, in addition to radiation. We examined the effect of chemical exposures on cancer mortality among French uranium processing workers at the AREVA NC Pierrelatte facility., METHODS: A cohort of 2,897 uranium processing workers employed for at least 6 months was followed from 1968 through 2006. Exposure to uranium and potentially carcinogenic chemicals was assessed with a plant-specific job-exposure matrix. Mortality hazard ratios (HRs) for cancers of the lung, lymphohematopoietic system, kidney and bladder, brain and central nervous system (BCNS), and prostate were estimated for each specific chemical exposure, with Cox regression models stratified for sex and calendar period and adjusted for socioeconomic status. Additional adjustments enabled us to examine the effect of co-exposure to uranium and other chemicals., RESULTS: Exposure to aromatic solvents was associated with increased risk of BCNS malignancies after adjustment for other chemicals (HR=6.53, 95% CI=1.14-37.41; n=6) and for other chemicals and uranium (HR=7.26, 95% CI=0.90-58.19) in the annual exposure status model. Selected groups of lymphohematopoietic cancers were found associated with solvent exposure. Inconclusive results were found regarding chromium (VI) exposure, since only 2 workers died from lung cancer among 109 exposed., CONCLUSION: Based on our pilot study, it seemed important to take into account chemical exposures in the analyses of cancer mortality among French uranium processing workers.

1916,"Salivary anionic changes after radiotherapy for nasopharyngeal carcinoma: A 1-year prospective study. Objectives: To investigate the salivary anionic changes of patients with nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) treated by radiotherapy. Material(s) and Method(s): Thirty-eight patients with T1-4, N0-2, M0 NPC received conventional radiotherapy. Stimulated whole saliva was collected at baseline and 2, 6 and 12 months after radiotherapy. Salivary anions levels were measured using ion chromatography. Result(s): A reduction in stimulated saliva flow and salivary pH was accompanied by sustained changes in anionic composition. At 2 months following radiotherapy, there was a significant increase in chloride, sulphate, lactate and formate levels while significant reductions in nitrate and thiocyanate levels were found. No further changes in these anion levels were observed at 6 and 12 months. No significant changes were found in phosphate, acetate, or propionate levels throughout the study period. Conclusion(s): Conventional radiotherapy has a significant and prolonged impact on certain anionic species, likely contributing to increased cariogenic properties and reduced antimicrobial capacities of saliva in NPC patients post-radiotherapy.Copyright © 2016 Pow et al.

1936,"Glaucoma incidence risk in a cohort of Mayak PA workers occupationally exposed to ionizing radiation. Glaucoma is a major cause of visual impairment, and secondary glaucoma manifested as neovascular glaucoma has long been known to occur following high-dose fractionated radiation therapy. In contrast, little is known as to whether ionizing radiation exposure causes primary glaucoma, except that a single study in Japanese atomic bomb survivors has reported a significantly increase risk. Therefore, the effect of lower dose and lower dose rate remains unclear. Here we report that in Russian Mayak Production Association workers occupationally exposed to chronic radiation for prolonged periods, incidence of total primary glaucoma and primary open-angle glaucoma is significantly associated with various non-radiation factors (sex, attained age, and cataract diagnosed prior to glaucoma), but neither with cumulative dose from external gamma-rays nor with cumulative neutron dose nor with the unweighted sum of cumulative gamma and neutron doses. The present results suggest for the first time that chronic radiation exposure does not cause primary glaucoma, although the analyses need to be made in other cohorts exposed at various dose and dose rate.",Included
1941,"Multilocus inheritance determines predisposition to alpha-radiation induced bone tumourigenesis in mice. In a recent study, we presented evidence for genetic predisposition governing radiation osteosarcomagenesis in mice. Following the incorporation of the bone-seeking alpha emitter 227Th, ~25% of the variance in osteosarcoma incidence was determined by inherited genetic factors. We have now mapped 5 susceptibility loci in crosses between the more susceptible BALB/c and the more resistant CBA/Ca strains. The major QTL on chromosome 14 overlaps with a locus that was already found in our previous study, using different strains of mice. Here, we investigate the effect by which the major susceptibility locus and 4 minor modifier loci interact to influence osteosarcoma predisposition. Following incorporation of the bone-seeking isotope, 100% of mice that harbour high-risk genotypes at all 5 susceptibility loci develop osteosarcoma with an average of 472 days latency times. In 10 mice inheriting exclusively low-risk genotypes only 1 osteosarcoma was found, arising after 733 days latency time. Inheritance of distinct combinations of BALB/c and CBA/Ca alleles at the susceptibility loci confer more extreme phenotypes in terms of susceptibility or resistance than observed in either of the two parental inbred strains. From the present study, we demonstrate that additive effects of multiple alleles, each making only a minor phenotypic contribution, can combine and significantly alter tumour risk. This mechanism can be of particular importance in genetically heterogeneous populations such as man. © 2005 Wiley-Liss, Inc.",Included
1958,"Ionizing radiation causes a dose-dependent release of transforming growth factor alpha in vitro from irradiated xenografts and during palliative treatment of hormone-refractory prostate carcinoma. PURPOSE: Characterize the radiation response for transforming growth factor (TGF) alpha shedding in vitro and in vivo. We also report the shedding of TGF alpha by patients undergoing irradiation for hormone-refractory prostate cancer., EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: TGF alpha levels were determined by ELISA. DU145 xenografts were established on the flanks of athymic nu/nu mice. Expression of phospho-extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK)1/2 and phospho-epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and the DNA repair proteins XRCC1 and ERCC1 were determined by Western analyses., RESULTS: Exposure to ionizing radiation results in a dose-dependent release of TGF alpha. Once released, TGF alpha stimulates EGFR-ERK1/2 signaling in unirradiated cells. Blockade of the EGFR with the tyrphostin AG1478 eliminates the up-regulation XRCC1 and ERCC1 by TGF alpha or irradiation. After irradiation, cells are refractory to additional transactivation of EGFR by additional irradiation for 8 to 12 hours. Irradiation during this refractory period does not increase the expression of XRCC1 or ERCC1. Ligand activation of EGFR is maintained during the refractory period. Irradiation of DU145 xenografts also results in the activation of ERK1/2, release of TGF alpha, and a similar refractory period. Ionizing irradiation also results in the release of TGF alpha for patients undergoing radiation therapy for hormone-refractory prostate cancer., CONCLUSIONS: Irradiation results in a dose-dependent increase in TGF alpha capable of enhancing the growth of DU145 xenografts. TGF alpha is also shed following radiation therapy of patients treated for hormone-refractory prostate cancer. Radiation transactivation of the EGFR produces a radio-refractory period, which lasts for several hours. During this period, additional irradiation fails to induce XRCC1, ERCC1, or additional TGF alpha release.",Included

Design(s): A retrospective cohort study was performed on retinoblastoma survivors who received the diagnosis from 1914 to 1984 and were interviewed in 2000. Lens doses were estimated from radiotherapy records. The cumulative time interval to cataract extraction between dose groups was compared using the log-rank test and Cox regression. Result(s): Seven hundred fifty-three subjects (828 eyes) were available for analysis for an average of 32 years of follow-up. During this period, 51 cataract extractions were reported. One extraction was reported in an eye with no radiotherapy compared with 36 extractions in 306 eyes with 1 course of radiotherapy and 14 among 38 eyes with 2 or 3 treatments. The average time interval to cataract extraction in irradiated eyes was 51 years (95% confidence interval [CI], 48-54) following 1 treatment and 32 years (95% CI, 27-37) after 2 or 3 treatments. Eyes exposed to a therapeutic radiation dose of 5 Gy or more had a 6-fold increased risk (95% CI, 1.3-27.2) of cataract extraction compared with eyes exposed to 2.5 Gy or less.

1970,"Enumeration of circulating microparticles in healthy medical workers occupationally exposed to low doses of ionizing radiation. Background: Strong evidence suggests microparticles (MP) as a biomarker of vascular injury. It may also contribute to the initiation and the development of atherosclerosis. In fact, several biological mechanisms might be responsible of atherosclerosis caused by radiation exposure even at a low dose. Therefore, the measurement of MP might be of a great potential for providing new insight into low-dose radiation cardiovascular risk. Aim(s): We investigated the effect of long-term medical occupational exposure to low doses of ionizing radiation (LDIR) on MP populations levels. Method(s): The current study was conducted in accordance with the Helsinki Declaration on 38 healthy medical workers occupationally exposed to LDIR and 29 matched controls by gender, age, and smoking habits. The measured MP by flow cytometry were classified as positive or negative phosphatidylserine (PS+ or PS-), and phenotyped according to their cellular origin. Result(s): Total MP (PS-/PS+), regardless of phenotype, were significantly higher in workers occupationally exposed to LDIR than controls (p=0.0004). In medical exposed workers, PS- MP predominated (68%) and were approximately three times more common than PS+ MP. Concerning the measurement of MP according to their cellular origin, we found that MP derived from platelets (CD41a+ PMP), endothelial (CD146+ EMP), leucocytes (CD45+ LMP) and erythrocytes (CD235a+ RMP) are more abundant in exposed workers than those in controls (p< 0.0001). However, no significant difference was found in the proportion of the other blood elements in the peripheral circulation between the two groups. In addition, no association was observed between MP levels and the studied confounding factors. Conclusion(s): Our results suggest that elevated circulating MP populations levels represent an indicator of cellular damage caused by medical exposure to LDIR. By consequence, the quantification of MP seems to a useful biomarker for assessing the negative effects of occupational exposure to ionizing radiation. (Figure Presented) .",Included

A cell culture assay has been developed that detects and validates single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in genes that populate the p53 pathway. One hundred thirteen EBV-transformed human B-lymphocyte cell lines obtained from a diverse population were employed to measure the apoptotic response to gamma radiation. Each cell line undergoes a reproducible, characteristic frequency of apoptosis, and the response of the population forms a normal distribution around a median of 35.5% apoptosis with a range from 12% to 58% apoptosis. Polymorphisms in the AKT1 and Perp genes significantly affect the frequency of apoptosis. The assay can detect both racial and sexual dimorphisms in these genes and has the ability to demonstrate epistatic relationships within the p53 pathway. The cell lines used in this assay provide biological materials to explore the molecular basis of the polymorphisms.Copyright © 2005 Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press.",Included

AIM: The aim of this study was to assess the expression of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) as a key proangiogenic factor and determine whether there is any correlation between its expression and clinical symptoms or endoscopic changes in patients with chronic radiation proctitis (ChRP)., METHOD: Fifty patients who had all undergone radiotherapy for prostate, cervical or uterine cancer were included in the study (37 women, 13 men). There was a control group of 20 patients (9 women, 11 men). The Radiation Therapy Oncology Group/European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (RTOG/EORTC) scoring system was used for grading the severity of the proctitis. Endoscopic scoring of late rectal mucosal damage was performed using Gilinsky's classification. Serum levels of VEGF were analysed by the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay method., RESULTS: Most patients presented with Grade 1 symptoms. Endoscopic assessment showed that most patients had Grade 1 late rectal mucosal damage. The predominant endoscopic finding was the presence of telangiectasia. Assessment of VEGF correlation between the control group and the degrees of endoscopic changes showed statistically significant differences for all three degrees (P < 0.0001, P = 0.0251 and P = 0.0005, respectively). Due to the small numbers of patients with Grades 2 and 3 symptoms using the RTOG/EORTC scoring system, they were grouped with Grades 1 and 4 respectively forming two groups for statistical purposes. VEGF expression differed significantly between controls and group I and between controls and group II (P = 0.0001, P = 0.0009, respectively)., CONCLUSION: A significant increase in VEGF expression was found to correlate with clinical symptoms and endoscopic rectal mucosa changes in patients with ChRP, suggesting that it may play an important role in pathological angiogenesis.

Results were stratified on the basis of self-reported occupational exposure to procedures that involve radiation., RESULTS: There were 1,543 employees (mean age 43 +/- 11.3 years, 33% male) who responded to the survey (response rate of 57%), and 1,042 (67.5%) reported being involved with procedures utilizing radiation. These employees reported experiencing work-related pain more often than the control group before (54.7% vs. 44.7%; p < 0.001) and after adjustment for age, sex, body mass index, pre-existing musculoskeletal conditions, years in profession, and job description (odds ratio: 1.67; 95% confidence interval: 1.32 to 2.11; p < 0.001). Musculoskeletal pain varied significantly by job description, with the highest incidence reported by technicians (62%) and nurses (60%) followed by attending physicians (44%) and trainees (19%; p < 0.001). There was no difference in cancer prevalence between groups (9% vs. 9%; p = 0.96)., CONCLUSIONS: Musculoskeletal pain is more common among healthcare workers who participate in interventional procedures and is highest in nonphysician employees. The diagnosis of cancer in employees who participate in procedures that utilize radiation was not elevated when compared to controls within the same departments, although any conclusion regarding causality is limited by the cross-sectional nature of the study, as well as the low overall prevalence of malignancy in our study group.

However, polymorphisms in DNA strand break repair genes that may determine mutagen sensitivity are not well studied in cancer risk, especially in gliomas., METHODS: We correlated genotype data for tag single-nucleotide polymorphisms (tSNPs) of DNA strand break repair genes with a gamma-radiation-induced mutagen sensitivity phenotype [expressed as mean breaks per cell (B/C)] in samples from 426 glioma patients. We also conducted analysis to assess joint and haplotype effects of single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) on mutagen sensitivity. We further validate our results in an independent external control group totaling 662 subjects., RESULTS: Of the 392 tSNPs examined, we found that mutagen sensitivity was modified by one tSNP in the EME2 gene and six tSNPs in the RAD51L1 gene (P < 0.01). Among the six RAD51L1 SNPs tested in the validation set, one (RAD51L1 rs2180611) was significantly associated with mutagen sensitivity (P = 0.025). Moreover, we found a significant dose-response relationship between the mutagen sensitivity and the number of adverse tSNP genotypes. Furthermore, haplotype analysis revealed that RAD51L1 haplotypes F-A (zero adverse allele) and F-E (six adverse alleles) exhibited the lowest (0.42) and highest (0.93) mean B/C values, respectively. A similar dose-response relationship also existed between the mutagen sensitivity and the number of adverse haplotypes., CONCLUSION: These results suggest that polymorphisms in and haplotypes of the RAD51L1 gene, which is involved in the double-strand break repair pathway, modulate gamma-radiation-induced mutagen sensitivity.",Included
2050,"Influence of dose rate on survival time for 239PuO2-induced radiation pneumonitis or pulmonary fibrosis in dogs. Beagle dogs were exposed once or repeatedly to 0.75-microns-diameter monodisperse aerosols of 239PuO2 by pernasal inhalation. The dogs that were exposed once received alveolar depositions (+/- standard deviation) of 3.9 +/- 1.9 kBq/kg body mass and accumulated doses of 23 +/- 8 Gy to the lung before death at 5.4 +/- 1.7 years after exposure. Dogs exposed repeatedly received a total alveolar deposition of 5.3 +/- 0.9 kBq/kg body mass during 7 to 10 semiannual exposures and accumulated doses of 22 +/- 5 Gy to the lung before death at 4.9 +/- 0.7 years after first exposure. Clearance of the plutonium from the lung in the dogs exposed repeatedly was slower than in the dogs exposed once. All dogs in the repeated-exposure study and all but one dog in the single-exposure study died from radiation effects. Pulmonary fibrosis accounted for 72% of the radiation-related deaths in the single-exposure study and 87% in the repeated-exposure study. The remaining dogs died with pulmonary cancer. Based on total cumulative radiation dose, the times after exposure to death from radiation pneumonitis and pulmonary fibrosis were not significantly different for single and repeated exposures. Thus dose rate does not appear to be an important factor in predicting death from radiation pneumonitis or pulmonary fibrosis for dogs inhaling 239PuO2.",Included

2064,"Intravascular radiation accelerates atherosclerotic lesion formation of hypercholesteremic rabbits. OBJECTIVES: The purpose of the present study is to evaluate the effect of intravascular radiation (IR) on the arterial wall of uninjured vessels in the hypercholesteremic rabbit model., METHODS: Aortas of 24 New Zealand white rabbits were treated with either intravascular 192-Ir gamma-radiation (15 Gy at 2 mm from the center of the source) or were exposed to the source catheter without radiation (sham controls). Following the radiation treatment, the animals were fed a 2% cholesterol diet until euthanasia at 2 (n=8) or 6 (n=16) weeks. Arteries were analyzed using light and scanning electron microscopy (SEM); transforming growth factor beta (TGF-beta) 1, a promoter of connective tissue deposition, was also monitored., RESULTS: At 2 weeks, SEM analysis showed well-aligned endothelial cells in nonradiated segments, whereas irradiated arteries consistently contained adherent and subendothelial macrophages with focal areas of endothelial disruption. Further radiated segments at 2 weeks showed a 7-fold increase in active TGF beta-1 over nonradiated segments. At 6 weeks, there was a significant increase in plaque and vessel wall area relative to control arteries, however, no differences were noted in the density of actin-positive smooth muscle cells (SMCs) or macrophages. Similarly, no differences were noted in cell proliferation between groups as evidenced by the marker bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU). In contrast, nonirradiated segments frequently contained cellular areas with extracellular lipid., CONCLUSION: Exposure of previously uninjured vessels to IR and hypercholesterolemia is associated with increased plaque burden and leads to more advanced plaque types. Special care should be taken to minimize radiation exposure in normal vascular segments in hypercholesterolemic patients undergoing radiation therapy.",Included
2068,"Mortality and cancer incidence following occupational radiation exposure: third analysis of the National Registry for Radiation Workers. Mortality and cancer incidence were studied in the National Registry for Radiation Workers in, relative to earlier analyses, an enlarged cohort of 174 541 persons, with longer follow-up (to 2001) and, for the first time, cancer registration data. SMRs for all causes and all malignant neoplasms were 81 and 84 respectively, demonstrating a 'healthy worker effect'. Within the cohort, mortality and incidence from both leukaemia excluding CLL and the grouping of all malignant neoplasms excluding leukaemia increased to a statistically significant extent with increasing radiation dose. Estimates of the trend in risk with dose were similar to those for the Japanese A-bomb survivors, with 90% confidence intervals that excluded both risks more than 2-3 times greater than the A-bomb values and no raised risk. Some evidence of an increasing trend with dose in mortality from all circulatory diseases may, at least partly, be due to confounding by smoking. This analysis provides the most precise estimates to date of mortality and cancer risks following occupational radiation exposure and strengthens the evidence for raised risks from these exposures. The cancer risk estimates are consistent with values used to set radiation protection standards.",Included

The utility of a biological dosimeter based on the analysis of dicentrics is invaluable in the event of a radiological emergency wherein the estimated absorbed dose of an exposed individual is crucial in the proper medical management of patients. The technique is also used for routine monitoring of occupationally exposed workers to determine radiation exposure. An in vitro irradiation study of human peripheral blood lymphocytes was conducted to establish a dose-response curve for radiation-induced dicentric aberrations. Blood samples were collected from volunteer donors and together with optically stimulated luminescence (OSL) dosimeters and were irradiated at 0, 0.1, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1, 2, 4, and 6 Gy using a cobalt-60 radiotherapy unit. Blood samples were cultured for 48 h, and the metaphase chromosomes were prepared following the procedure of the International Atomic Energy Agency's Emergency Preparedness and Response - Biodosimetry 2011 manual. At least 100 metaphases were scored for dicentric aberrations at each dose point. The data were analyzed using R language program. The results indicated that the distribution of dicentric cells followed a Poisson distribution and the dose-response curve was established using the estimated model, Ydic = 0.0003 (+/-0.0003) +0.0336 (+/-0.0115) x D + 0.0236 (+/-0.0054) x D2. In this study, the reliability of the dose-response curve in estimating the absorbed dose was also validated for 2 and 4 Gy using OSL dosimeters. The data were fitted into the constructed curve.

Up to 31th December 2008, a total of 1,840 aortal atherosclerosis cases were registered in the examinees group. Aortal atherosclerosis prevalence appeared to depend reliably on sex, age, smoking habit (in males), alcohol consumption (in males) and arterial hypertension. Findings are that aortal atherosclerosis prevalence was higher in males and females underwent external gamma-irradiation of total dose over 0.5 Gy, in males and females underwent internal alpha-irradiation from incorporated plutonium of total absorbed radiation dose in liver over 0.025 Gy.

2139,"Differential radio-adaptive responses in BALB/c and C57BL/6 mice: pivotal role of calcium and nitric oxide signalling. Purpose: Our earlier studies demonstrated that transient radio-adaptive responses (RAR) in BALB/c mice were due to MAPK hyperactivation. The objective of this study was to determine the time duration of this low dose induced MAPK activation in BALB/c mice and to find out if similar adaptive responses are observed in C57BL/6 mice. Materials and methods: Mice were irradiated with 0.1 Gy priming dose (PD), 2 Gy challenge dose (CD) with an interval of 4 h (P + CD) and radiation induced immunosuppression in splenic lymphocytes was monitored as the endpoint for RAR. Results: Time kinetics following 0.1 Gy demonstrated persistence of MAPK hyperactivation till 48 h. Similar experiments in C57BL/6 mice indicated absence of RAR at 24 h following CD, in spite of MAPK activation which was also confirmed by time kinetics. Therefore, upstream activators of MAPK, viz., reactive oxygen and nitrogen species (ROS, RNS) and calcium levels were estimated. There was increased intracellular calcium (Ca2+) and nitric oxide (NO) in BALB/c and an increase in intracellular ROS in C57BL/6 mice 24 h after PD. Inhibition of NO and calcium chelation abrogated RAR in BALB/c mice. In vitro treatment of spleen cells with combination of NO donor and Ca2+ ionophore mimicked the effect of PD and induced adaptive response after 2 Gy not only in BALB/c but also in C57BL/6 mice confirming their crucial role in RAR. Conclusions: These results suggest that low dose induced differential induction of Ca2+ and NO signaling along with MAPK was responsible for contrasting RAR with respect to immune system of BALB/c and C57BL/6 mice.

Radiation exposure is known to have profound effects on the brain, leading to precursor cell dysfunction and debilitating cognitive declines [Nat. Med. 8 (2002) 955]. Although a plethora of data exist on the effects of high radiation doses, the effects of low-dose irradiation, such as ones received during repetitive diagnostic and therapeutic exposures, are still under-investigated [Am. J. Otolaryngol. 23 (2002) 215; Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 97 (2000) 889; Curr. Opin. Neurol. 16 (2003) 129]. Furthermore, most studies of the biological effects of ionizing radiation have been performed using a single acute dose, while clinically and environmentally relevant exposures occur predominantly under chronic/repetitive conditions. Here, we have used a mouse model to compare the effects of chronic/repetitive and acute low-dose radiation (LDR) exposure (0.5Gy) to ionizing radiation on the brain in vivo. We examined the LDR effects on p42/44 MAPK (ERK1/ERK2), CaMKII, and AKT signaling-the interconnected pathways that have been previously shown to be crucial for neuronal survival upon irradiation. We report perturbations in ERK1/2, AKT, and CREB upon acute and chronic/repetitive low-dose exposure in the hippocampus and frontal cortex of mice. These studies were paralleled by the analysis of radiation effects on neurogenesis and cellular proliferation. Repetitive exposure had a much more pronounced effect on cellular signaling and neurogenesis than acute exposure. These results suggest that studies of single acute exposures might be limited in terms of their predictive value. We also present the first evidence of sex differences in radiation-induced signaling in the hippocampus and frontal cortex. We show the role of estrogens in brain radiation responses and discuss the implications of the observed changes.",Included
2204,"Polymorphisms in DNA repair genes: Link with biomarkers of the CBMN cytome assay in hospital workers chronically exposed to low doses of ionising radiation. Individual sensitivity to ionising radiation (IR) is the result of interaction between exposure, DNA damage, and its repair, which is why polymorphisms in DNA repair genes could play an important role. We examined the association between DNA damage, expressed as micronuclei (MNi), nuclear buds (NBs), and nucleoplasmic bridges (NPBs) and single nucleotide polymorphisms in selected DNA repair genes (APE1, hOGG1, XRCC1, XRCC3, XPD, PARP1, MGMT genes; representative of the different DNA repair pathways operating in mammals) in 77 hospital workers chronically exposed to low doses of IR, and 70 matched controls. A significantly higher MNi frequency was found in the exposed group (16.2+/-10.4 vs. 11.5+/-9.4; P=0.003) and the effect appeared to be independent from the principal confounding factor. Exposed individuals with hOGG1, XRCC1, PARP1, and MGMT wild-type alleles or APEX1, as well as XPD (rs13181) heterozygous showed a significantly higher MNi frequency than controls with the same genotypes.

Objective Owing to their rarity and proteiform pathologic features, the clinical behavior of atypical meningiomas is not yet well characterized. Though the extent of resection is believed to be a key determinant of prognosis, limited data exist regarding optimal management of patients with recurrent disease. Methods In this 20-year retrospective case series, we reviewed the medical records of 46 patients with recurrent atypical meningomas (185 lesions, 89 of which were local, 78 marginal, and 18 distant recurrences); treatment was radiosurgery (n = 60), surgery (n = 56), or both (n = 8). The median follow-up period was 53 months. Outcome measures were length of overall survival and disease-free intervals and prognostic factors for survival. Results Overall, the median progression-free survival was 26 months at the first recurrence and 100 months thereafter (the sum of the later intervals). Multivariate analysis showed that no treatment-related factors influenced prognosis, whereas recurrence at the skull base was a significant tumor-related factor limiting further treatment. Irrespective of treatment type, the recurrence-free interval was increasingly shorter during the clinical course, with a higher occurrence of marginal and distant lesions migrating to the midline and to the skull base. In sporadic cases, disease-free intervals were longer after wide craniotomy, tumor and dural resection with tumor-free margin. Conclusions The disease-free interval was substantially similar after surgery and radiosurgery for treating recurrent disease in patients with atypical meningiomas. Surgery is the mainstay for prolonging survival, while radiosurgery can be an adjuvant strategy to gain time for clinical observation and planning aggressive surgical treatment.Copyright © 2016 Elsevier Inc.

PURPOSE: Lower radiation tolerance of the whole liver hinders dose escalations of stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) treatment. This study was conducted to define the exact doses that result in radiation-induced liver disease (RILD) as well as to determine dose constraints for the critical organs at risk (OARs) in mice; these parameters are still undefined in HCC SBRT., METHODS: This study consisted of two phases. In the primary phase, mice treated with helical tomotherapy-based SBRT were stratified according to escalating radiation doses to the livers. The pathological differences, signs [such as mouse performance status (MPS)], and serum aspartate aminotransferase (AST)/alanine aminotransferase (ALT)/albumin levels were observed. Radiation-induced disease severities of the OARs were scored using systematic evaluation standards. In the validation phase in humans, 13 patients with HCC who had undergone radiotherapy before hepatectomy were enrolled to validate RILD pathological changes in a mouse study., RESULTS: The evaluation criteria of the mouse liver radiotherapy-related signs were as follows: MPS >= 2.0 +/- 0.52, AST/ALT >= 589.2 +/- 118.5/137.4 +/- 15.3 U/L, serum albumin <= 16.8 +/- 2.29 g/L. The preliminary dose constraints of the OARs were also obtained, such as those for the liver (average dose <= 26.36 +/- 1.71 Gy) and gastrointestinal tract (maximum dose <= 22.63 Gy). Mouse RILD models were able to be developed when the livers were irradiated with average doses of >=31.76 +/- 1.94 Gy (single fraction). RILD pathological changes in mice have also been validated in HCC patients., CONCLUSIONS: Mouse RILD models could be developed with SBRT based on the dose constraints for the OARs and evaluation criteria of mouse liver radiotherapy-related signs, and the authors' results favor the study of further approaches to treat HCC with SBRT.",Included

At 40 days of age and older no effect was observed. This inhibition was a delayed phenomenon, dose-dependent and with no recovery.

2365,"Does Vacuum-assisted Closure Reduce the Risk of Wound Complications in Patients With Lower Extremity Sarcomas Treated With Preoperative Radiation?. BACKGROUND: Although preoperative radiation followed by wide local excision yields excellent local control in soft tissue sarcomas, the risk of wound complications is reported to be higher compared with the incidence in patients who were administered postoperative radiation therapy. Vacuum (vac)-assisted closure may improve wound healing, but it is unknown whether vac-assisted closure during soft tissue sarcoma resection may reduce the risk of wound complications or impair local disease control., QUESTIONS/PURPOSES: (1) Does the use of a wound vac application at the time of soft tissue sarcoma resection reduce the risk of developing wound complications after lower extremity sarcoma resection? (2) Is vac-assisted closure associated with an increased risk of local relapse?, METHODS: From 2000 to 2016, 312 patients with stage I to III soft tissue sarcomas were treated. Of these, 123 were treated with preoperative radiation +/- chemotherapy followed by limb-sparing resection based on tumor location, size, grade, histology, and patient age. There was a minimum followup of 12 months. Radiation was delivered generally based on tumor size, grade, superficial versus deep nature, and proximity to neurovascular structures. Chemotherapy was administered in patients < 70 years old with high-grade tumors and tumors > 5 cm. Patient, demographic, and treatment variables, including incisional vac application and wound outcomes, were retrospectively evaluated. Incisional vac-assisted closure took place at the time of primary resection in 32% (46 of 123) of patients. Vac-assisted closure was considered when there was a concern for risk of external contamination such as instances in which fixation of adhesives would be difficult or regions where there was a high risk of contamination. Vac-assisted closure may have also been used in instances with increased wound tension at closure or with heightened concern for shearing on the wound such as buttock wounds. Ten patients were lost to followup, two in the vac group and eight in the non-vac group. Potential factors associated with wound complications were evaluated using Fisher's exact test for univariate analysis and logistic regression for multivariate analysis. Local recurrence-free survival was evaluated using the Kaplan-Meier estimate., RESULTS: After taking into consideration factors such as tumor size, location, age, and patient comorbidities, it was shown that patients who underwent vac-assisted closure were less likely to experience wound complications compared with patients who did not undergo vac-assisted closure (odds ratio, 0.129; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.041-0.398; p = 0.004). The local control incidence in the entire cohort was 98%. With the numbers available, Kaplan-Meier survivorship free from local recurrence did not differ between patients treated with or without the vac (100% [95% CI, 154.09-154.09] versus 96% [95% CI, 152.21-169.16]; p = 0.211), respectively., CONCLUSIONS: Vac-assisted closure at the time of resection of proximal lower extremity soft tissue sarcomas is associated with a lower risk of wound complications, and its use apparently did not compromise local control. We show that the use of vac-assisted closure may be worth considering in surgeons' attempts to reduce the risk of wound complications among patients with soft tissue sarcomas of the proximal lower extremities., LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Level III, therapeutic study.",Included

Experiments here reported suggest that 2 consecutive total-body gamma-irradiations of 150 rads each are sufficient to induce in rats the development of tumors, some malignant; 18 of 19 females (94.7%) developed tumors at an average age of 11.4 mo, and seven of the 14 males in this group (50%) developed tumors at an average age of 10.4 mo. In the second group, which received 3 consecutive gamma-irradiations, 20 of 23 females (86.9%) and 5 of 13 males (38.4%) developed tumors at average ages of 9.1 and 7.5 mo, respectively.

The etiology of tumors either developing spontaneously or induced by irradiation in rats remains to be clarified. Our attempts to detect virus particles by electron microscopy in such tumors or lymphomas have not been successful. As a working hypothesis, we are tempted to theorize that tumors or lymphomas developing spontaneously or induced by gamma irradiation in rats are caused by latent viral agents which are integrated into the cell genome and are cell associated, i.e., not separable from the rat tumor cells by conventional methods thus far used.",Included

PURPOSE: In the present study, we examined human Ewing's sarcoma (ES) and peripheral primitive neuroectodermal tumor (pPNET) cell lines that are able to produce TNF-alpha as part of the response to irradiation. Radiation-induced tumor cell production of TNF-alpha may enhance irradiation efficacy and improve the effect of local tumor irradiation. On the other hand, radiation-induced tumor cell production of TNF-alpha may adversely affect the normal tissue., METHODS AND MATERIALS: Twelve different ES/pPNET cell lines were investigated in vitro and (after establishment as tumor xenografts in athymic nude mice) in vivo for their TNF-alpha mRNA expression (real-time quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction) and TNF-alpha protein production (in vitro: enhanced amplified sensitivity immunoassay; in vivo: immunohistochemistry) after exposure to different irradiation doses (2, 5, 10, 20, 30, or 40 Gy) and after different time intervals (1, 3, 6, 12, 24, 48, or 72 h after irradiation). The bioactivity of the TNF-alpha protein was evaluated in chromogenic cytotoxicity and neutralization assays., RESULTS: Nine out of 12 ES/pPNET cell lines express constitutively significant quantities of bioactive TNF-alpha in vitro. ES/pPNET cells originating from primary tumors secreted higher TNF-alpha levels than cells derived from metastatic lesions. In 5 of the 9 TNF-alpha-producing cell lines, TNF-alpha mRNA and protein levels were upregulated after irradiation exposure in a time- and dose-dependent manner. After establishment of the ES/pPNET cell lines in athymic nude mice, the radiation-induced TNF-alpha release could be demonstrated also in the xenograft tumors in vivo (analogous to the in vitro experiments). Using the same methods for quantitative analysis, it was determined that the TNF-alpha expression of the radiation-responsive tumor cells was up to 2000-fold higher compared to the maximal radiation-induced TNF-alpha release in normal lung tissue measured during the pneumonic phase., CONCLUSION: Certain ES/pPNET cell lines produce extremely large quantities of bioactive TNF-alpha after radiation exposure in a time- and dose-dependent manner. Radiation-induced TNF-alpha production of tumor cells may be of paramount importance in respect to not only tumor behavior, but also to potential damage to normal tissue and the clinical status of the host.",Included

We now demonstrate that SOD is involved in the resistance of Drosophila melanogaster against irradiation. The protection is greatest when flies carry the S form of the enzyme (which exhibits highest in vitro specific activity), intermediate when they carry the F form of the enzyme, and lowest when they are homozygous for N, an allele that reduces the amount of the enzyme to 3.5% of the normal level. Natural selection experiments show that the fitness of the high-activity S allele is increased in an irradiated population relative to the nonirradiated control. These results point towards a possible adaptive function of the S/F polymorphism found in natural populations of D. melanogaster.",Included
2461,"Occupational ionising radiation and risk of basal cell carcinoma in US radiologic technologists (1983-2005). OBJECTIVE: To determine risk for incident basal cell carcinoma from cumulative low-dose ionising radiation in the US radiologic technologist cohort., METHODS: We analysed 65,719 Caucasian technologists who were cancer-free at baseline (1983-1989 or 1994-1998) and answered a follow-up questionnaire (2003-2005). Absorbed radiation dose to the skin in mGy for estimated cumulative occupational radiation exposure was reconstructed for each technologist based on badge dose measurements, questionnaire-derived work history and protection practices, and literature information. Radiation-associated risk was assessed using Poisson regression and included adjustment for several demographic, lifestyle, host and sun exposure factors., RESULTS: Cumulative mean absorbed skin dose (to head/neck/arms) was 55.8 mGy (range 0-1735 mGy). For lifetime cumulative dose, we did not observe an excess radiation-related risk (excess relative risk/Gy=-0.01 (95% CI -0.43 to 0.52). However, we observed that basal cell carcinoma risk was increased for radiation dose received before age 30 (excess relative risk/Gy=0.59, 95% CI -0.11 to 1.42) and before 1960 (excess relative risk/Gy=2.92, 95% CI 1.39 to 4.45)., CONCLUSIONS: Basal cell carcinoma risk was unrelated to low-dose radiation exposure among radiologic technologists. Because of uncertainties in dosimetry and sensitivity to model specifications, both our null results and our findings of excess risk for dose received before age 30 and exposure before 1960 should be interpreted with caution.

Myeloidtranslocation genes (MTGs) are transcriptional corepressorsimplicated in development, malignancy, differentiation, and stem cellfunction. While MTG16 loss renders mice sensitive to chemicalcolitis, the role of MTG16 in the small intestine is unknown. Histologicalexamination revealed that Mtg16-/- mice have increasedenterocyte proliferation and goblet cell deficiency. After exposure toradiation, Mtg16-/- mice exhibited increased crypt viability anddecreased apoptosis compared with wild-type (WT) mice. Flow cytometricand immunofluorescence analysis of intestinal epithelial cellsfor phospho-histone H2A.X also indicated decreased DNA damageand apoptosis in Mtg16-/- intestines. To determine if Mtg16 deletionaffected epithelial cells in a cell-autonomous fashion, intestinal cryptswere isolated from Mtg16-/- mice. Mtg16-/-and WT intestinalcrypts showed similar enterosphere forming efficiencies when culturedin the presence of EGF, Noggin, and R-spondin. However, whenMtg16-/- crypts were cultured in the presence of Wnt3a, theydemonstrated higher enterosphere forming efficiencies and delayedprogression to mature enteroids. Mtg16-/- intestinal crypts isolatedfrom irradiated mice exhibited increased survival compared with WTintestinal crypts. Interestingly, Mtg16 expression was reduced in astem cell-enriched population at the time of crypt regeneration. Thisis consistent with MTG16 negatively regulating regeneration in vivo.Taken together, our data demonstrate that MTG16 loss promotesradioresistance and impacts intestinal stem cell function, possibly dueto shifting cellular response away from DNA damage-induced apoptosisand towards DNA repair after injury.Copyright © 2015 the American Physiological Society.",Included

2584,"Association Between Radiation Dose and Outcomes With Postoperative Radiotherapy for N0-N1 Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer. PURPOSE: To review trends in the use of postoperative radiotherapy (PORT) in the modern era for N0-N1 margin-negative non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) following surgical resection and evaluate the association between PORT dose and overall survival., MATERIALS AND METHODS: We performed a retrospective study of nonmetastatic stage II and III N0-N1 margin-negative NSCLC surgically treated patients within the National Cancer Data Base from 2003 to 2011. Cox proportional hazards regression was performed for multivariable analyses of overall survival and PORT dose. Radiation modalities included nonconformal beam radiation, 3-dimensional conformal radiation (3D-CRT), and intensity-modulated radiation therapy., RESULTS: We identified 2167 (6.7%) and 30,269 (93.3%) patients with surgically resected stage II or III N0-N1 margin-negative NSCLC who were treated with and without PORT, respectively. The proportion of patients treated with PORT (dose range, 45 to 74 Gy) decreased from 8.9% in 2003 to 2006 to 4.1% in 2010 to 2011. Among patients receiving PORT, the use of high-dose (60 to 74 Gy) PORT rose throughout the study period, starting at 34.8% in 2003 to 2006 and rising to 49.3% in 2010 to 2011.Overall, patients who received PORT had worse survival (hazards ratio=1.30; 95% confidence interval, 1.20-1.40) compared with those not receiving PORT. This association was unchanged when limited to patients receiving modern treatment with 3-CRT or intensity-modulated radiation therapy (hazards ratio=1.35; 95% confidence interval, 1.10-1.65)., CONCLUSIONS: The use of PORT for N0-N1 margin-negative NSCLC decreased from 2003 to 2011. We found no evidence of benefit from PORT for resected N0-N1 margin-negative NSCLC, regardless of dose or technique. PORT should be approached with caution in this group of patients, regardless of radiotherapy technique.",Included

2612,"Biological effects of low-dose chest CT on chromosomal DNA. Background: Although the National Lung Screening Trial reported a significant reduction in lung cancer mortality when low-dose (LD) CT chest examinations are used for a diagnosis, their biologic effects from radiation exposure remain unclear. Purpose(s): To compare LD CT and standard-dose (SD) CT for DNA double-strand breaks and chromosome aberrations (CAs) in peripheral blood lymphocytes. Material(s) and Method(s): Between March 2016 and June 2018, 209 participants who were referred to a respiratory surgery department for chest CT studies were prospectively enrolled in this study. Individuals were excluded if they had undergone radiography examinations within the last 3 days or had undergone chemotherapy or radiation therapy. Peripheral blood samples were obtained before and 15 minutes after CT. The number of g-H2AX foci and unstable CAs in lymphocytes was quantified by immunofluorescent staining of g-H2AX and by fluorescence in situ hybridization by using peptide nucleic acid probes for centromeres and telomeres, respectively. The Wilcoxon signed rank test was used for statistical analysis. Bonferroni correction was applied for multiple comparisons. Result(s): Of the 209 participants (105 women, 104 men; mean age, 67.0 years 6 11.3 [standard deviation]), 107 underwent chest LD CT and 102 underwent chest SD CT. Sex distribution, age, and body size metrics were similar between the two groups. The median effective dose of LD CT and SD CT was 1.5 and 5.0 mSv, respectively. The number of double-strand breaks and CAs increased after a SD CT examination (g-H2AX, P , .001; CAs, P = .003); the number of double-strand breaks and CAs before and after LD CT was not different (g-H2AX, P = .45; CAs, P = .69). Conclusion(s): No effect of low-dose CT on human DNA was detected. In the same setting, DNA double-strand breaks and chromosome aberrations increased after standard-dose CT.Copyright © RSNA, 2020.",Included
2622,"Mesenchymal stem cell therapy for cutaneous radiation syndrome. Systemic and local radiation injuries caused by nuclear power reactor accidents, therapeutic irradiation, or nuclear terrorism should be prevented or properly treated in order to improve wound management and save lives. Currently, regenerative surgical modalities should be attempted with temporal artificial dermis impregnated and sprayed with a local angiogenic factor such as basic fibroblast growth factor, and secondary reconstruction can be a candidate for demarcation and saving the donor morbidity. Human mesenchymal stem cells and adipose-derived stem cells, together with angiogenic and mitogenic factor of basic fibroblast growth factor and an artificial dermis, were applied over the excised irradiated skin defect and were tested for differentiation and local stimulation effects in the radiation-exposed wounds. The perforator flap and artificial dermal template with growth factor were successful for reconstruction in patients who were suffering from complex underlying disease. Patients were uneventfully treated with minimal morbidities. In the experiments, the hMSCs are strongly proliferative even after 20 Gy irradiation in vitro. In vivo, 4 Gy rat whole body irradiation demonstrated that sustained marrow stromal (mesenchymal stem) cells survived in the bone marrow. Immediate artificial dermis application impregnated with cells and the cytokine over the 20 Gy irradiated skin and soft tissues demonstrated the significantly improved fat angiogenesis, architected dermal reconstitution, and less inflammatory epidermal recovery. Detailed understanding of underlying diseases and rational reconstructive procedures brings about good outcomes for difficult irradiated wound healing. Adipose-derived stem cells are also implicated in the limited local injuries for short cell harvesting and processing time in the same subject. Copyright © 2010 Health Physics Society.",Included
2646,"Noninvasive evaluation of radiation-enhanced glioma cells invasiveness by ultra-high-field (1)H-MRS in vitro. INTRODUCTION: Glioma is the most common type of the primary CNS tumor. Radiotherapy is an important treatment measure after surgery. However, its highly invasive character is the main reason of postoperative recurrence. The aim of the study was to probe the correlation between the invasion ability and the metabolite characteristics of glioma cells at the cellular level after irradiation by using 14.7T high-resolution nuclear proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy ((1)H-MRS)., METHODS: To determine the matrix metalloproteinase-2 (MMP-2) activity and metabolite ratios of glioma cells after irradiation with different doses of X-rays, U87 and C6 glioma cells were exposed to X-ray irradiation of 0, 1, 5, 10, and 15Gy. After 20h, the perchloric acid (PCA) extraction method was used to evaluate water-soluble metabolites [choline (Cho), creatine (Cr), and N-acetylaspartate (NAA)], and (1)H-MRS patterns and changes in metabolite ratios were observed in vitro by 14.7T high resolution (1)H-MRS. Matrigel invasion assays and gelatin zymography were performed to test the invasion ability of U87 and C6 glioma cells., RESULTS: Good MR spectra were obtained from PCA method extracts of U87 and C6 glioma cells. Both radiation-induced MMP-2 activity and the Cho/Cr and Cho/NAA ratios increased after irradiation, and their increase occurred in a dose-dependent manner. The MMP-2 activity and the Cho/Cr and Cho/NAA ratios of glioma cells increased after irradiation up to 10Gy and decreased thereafter. In particular, the Cho/NAA ratio of U87 cells increased from 3.55+/-0.06 (0Gy) to 9.13+/-0.30 (10Gy) and then declined to 5.94+/-0.15 (15Gy). Furthermore, the invasion ability of glioma cells had a strong positive correlation with the Cho/Cr and Cho/NAA ratios. Both the Cho/Cr ratio and the Cho/NAA ratio of U87 glioma cells were highly positively correlated with the number of invading cells in the Matrigel invasion assay. The Pearson's correlation coefficient (r) values of U87 cells were 0.89 (Cho/Cr ratio versus invasion ability) and 0.91 (Cho/NAA ratio versus invasion ability) (P<0.01). C6 cells exhibited similar changes to those of U87 cells., CONCLUSIONS: In vitro high-resolution (1)H-MRS is useful for detecting glioma invasiveness at the cellular level. Copyright © 2016.

Analysis of the relationship between dose and mortality from cancer and circulation diseases in the cohort of Chernobyl clean-up workers based on the data from the National Radiation and Epidemiological Registry was performed. Medical and dosimetry information on the clean-up workers, males, who got radiation doses from April 26, 1986 to April 26, 1987, which was accumulated from 1992 to 2012, was used for the analysis. The total size of the cohort was 42929 people, 12731 deaths were registered in the cohort, among them 1893 deaths from solid cancers and 5230 deaths were from circulation diseases. An average age of the workers was 39 years in 1992 and the mean dose was 164 mGy. The dose-effect relationship was estimated with the use of non-parametric analysis of survival with regard to concurrence of risks of mortality. The risks were estimated in 6 dose groups of similar size (1-70, 70-130, 130-190, 190-210, 210-230 and.230-1000 mGy). The group ""1-70 mGy"" was used as control. Estimated dose-effect relationship related to cancers and circulation diseases is described approximately with a linear model, coefficient of determination (the proportion of variability explained by the linear model) for cancers was 23-25% and for circulation diseases - 2-13%. The slope coefficient of the dose-effect relationship normalized to 1 Gy for the ratio of risks for cancers in the linear model was 0.47 (95% CI: -0.77, 1.71), and for circulation diseases it was 0.22 (95% CI: -0.58, 1.02). Risks coefficient (slope coefficient of excess mortality at a dose of 1 Gy) for solid cancers was 1.94 (95% CI: - 3.10, 7.00) x 10(-2) and for circulation diseases it was 0.67 (95% CI: -9.61, 11.00) x 10(-2). 137 deaths from radiation-induced cancers and 47 deaths from circulation diseases were registered during a follow up period.",Included
2685,"Effect of fluoroscopic X-rays combined with iodinated radiographic contrast media on human hematological parameters. Introduction: Fluoroscopic X-rays are widely used for examinations around the world. Technicians often use an iodinated radiographic contrast media during fluoroscopic X-ray examinations. Objective(s): This study examined the impact on hematological parameters for human blood and morphology of red blood cells that were exposed to fluoroscopic X-ray combined with iodinated radiographic contrast media, i.e., iopromid, iohexol, and iodixanol. Method(s): Blood samples from male and female subjects were incubated with 5 mgI/mL of iodinated radiographic contrast media for 5 min, then were irradiated using fluoroscopic X-rays (70 kV, 0.8 mA) for 10, 30, and 60 min. Hematological parameters of the blood samples were determined by a clinical service center, and morphology of red blood cells was examined by light microscope. Comparison of mean values of hematological parameters based on the student's t-tests between irradiated blood alone, iodinated radiographic contrast media-incubated blood alone, and combination-exposed blood to each corresponding control blood was performed. Result(s): These data showed no change in the hematological parameters and morphology of red blood cells in irradiated blood alone, iodinated radiographic contrast media-incubated blood alone, and combination-exposed blood in both male and female subjects when compared to control blood at all fluoroscopic X-ray times. Conclusion(s): These finding suggested that there were no harmful effects following fluoroscopic X-rays combined with iodinated radiographic contrast media when human blood was irradiated in an in vitro condition.Copyright © 2021, Korean Society of Environmental Risk Assessment and Health Science.",Included

Although body fat distribution is also considered to be a predictor of DM, only a few longitudinal studies have examined the association between DM risk and body composition, estimated directly using such methods as DEXA, in particular with reference to Asian populations who have a higher prevalence of DM at lower BMI levels compared with CaucAsians. Objective(s): To determine whether fat distribution is associated with DM incidence, independently of BMI, in an elderly Japanese population. Method(s): We analyzed 1,550 subjects without DM (472 men and 1,078 women, average age of 65.3 years) in the Adult Health Study, consisting of atomic bomb survivors and their controls, whose body composition was measured using DEXA during the period 1994-96. Fat-mass percentages for the trunk and legs were calculated by dividing each of the specific body partTMs fat mass by total soft tissue mass. DM was defined as glucose 126mg/dl fasting or 200mg/dl nonfasting, or physician-diagnosed DM, or the use of medication for DM. We followed-up through the end of 2011. Result(s): During a mean follow-up period of 11.4 years, 85 men and 110 women developed DM. Almost 20% of men and 28% of women were overweight/obese (BMI25kg/m2) at baseline. After multivariate analysis with adjustment made for age, metabolic syndrome risk factors other than central obesity, radiation dose, and smoking and alcohol consumption status, only overweight/obese women had a significant association with DM incidence compared with non-obese women (relative risk [RR] 1.52; 95% CI 1.01-2.27). Percentages of trunk fat and leg fat were associated with incidence of DM, independently of each other, after adjustment for age, BMI, and other risk factors. Increased percentage of trunk fat was a significant risk factor for incidence of DM; the RR for 1% increase in trunk fat were 1.13 (95% CI 1.06-1.20) in men and 1.08 (95% CI 1.02-1.14) in women, whereas, leg fat had protective effects regarding incidence of DM (men RR 0.83; 95% CI 0.71-0.96, women RR 0.87; 95% CI 0.79-0.95, for 1% increase in leg fat). These significant associations were observed for non-obese subjects. Conclusion(s): Trunk and leg fat were associated with incidence of DM, independently of each other. In addition to evaluation of general and abdominal obesity, the assessment of body fat distribution might also be useful in the prevention of DM.",Included

The aim of this study was to assess whether there is a dose-dependent relationship between radiation dose and myocardial fibrosis in patients who received neoadjuvant chemoradiation (nCRT) for esophageal cancer (EC). Methods and Materials: Forty patients with EC treated with a transthoracic esophagectomy with (n = 20) or without (n = 20) nCRT (CROSS study regimen) were included. Cardiovascular magnetic resonance imaging (1.5 Tesla) for left ventricular (LV) function, late gadolinium enhancement, and T1 mapping were performed. Extracellular volume (ECV), as a surrogate for collagen burden, was measured for all LV segments separately. The dose-response relationship between ECV and mean radiation dose per LV myocardial segment was evaluated using a mixed-model analysis. Result(s): Seventeen nCRT and 16 control patients were suitable for analysis. The mean time after treatment was 67.6 +/- 8.1 (nCRT) and 122 +/- 35 (controls) months (P = .02). In nCRT patients, we found a significantly higher mean global ECV of 28.2% compared with 24.0% in the controls (P < .001). After nCRT, LV myocardial segments with elevated ECV had received significantly higher radiation doses. In addition, a linear dose-effect relation was found with a 0.136% point increase of ECV for each Gy (P < .001). There were no differences in LV function measures and late gadolinium enhancement between both groups. Conclusion(s): Myocardial ECV was significantly higher in long-term EC survivors after nCRT compared with surgery only. Moreover, this ECV increase was linear with the radiation dose per LV segment, indicating radiation-induced myocardial fibrosis.Copyright © 2021 The Author(s)",Included

These results show that health conditions of the liquidators became worse during the whole observation period. A considerable development of both pathological states atypical of radiation damages and diseases, which may be considered as radiation-induced ones, was determined. Rise of the sickness rate of almost all organism systems, first of all, nervous, cardiovascular, respiratory and digestive ones, was observed. In 70% of liquidators the main disease was primarily detected after working on CNPP. In the intervening years, the average number of diagnoses per 1 liquidator increased from 1.5 in 1987 to 7-8 in the recent time. In addition to the detected diseases, particular functional shifts in neuropsychological and vegetative status of the liquidators were observed. The overwhelming majority of them have increased tonicity of the sympathetic vegetative nervous system, asthenic and depressive syndromes occurring in the form of weakness, somnolence, mood instability, mental capacity decrease, and memory defects.

2779,"Radiation-induced malignancies after intensity-modulated versus conventional mediastinal radiotherapy in a small animal model. A long-standing hypothesis in radiotherapy is that intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) increases the risk of second cancer due to low-dose exposure of large volumes of normal tissue. Therefore, young patients are still treated with conventional techniques rather than with modern IMRT. We challenged this hypothesis in first-of-its-kind experiments using an animal model. Cancer-prone Tp53+/C273X knockout rats received mediastinal irradiation with 3x5 or 3x8Gy using volumetric-modulated arc therapy (VMAT, an advanced IMRT) or conventional anterior-posterior/posterior-anterior (AP/PA) beams using non-irradiated rats as controls (n=15/group, ntotal=90). Tumors were assigned to volumes receiving 90-107%, 50-90%, 5-50%, and <5% of the target dose and characterized by histology and loss-of-heterozygosity (LOH). Irradiated rats predominantly developed lymphomas and sarcomas in areas receiving 50-107% (n=26) rather than 5-50% (n=7) of the target dose. Latency was significantly shortened only after 3x8Gy vs. controls (p<0.0001). The frequency (14/28 vs. 19/29; p=0.29) and latency (218 vs. 189 days; p=0.17) of radiation-associated tumors were similar after VMAT vs. AP/PA. LOH was strongly associated with sarcoma but not with treatment. The results do not support the hypothesis that IMRT increases the risk of second cancer. Thus the current practice of withholding dose-sparing IMRT from young patients may need to be re-evaluated.",Included

We used speed-of-sound (SOS) measurements to evaluate the effects of gamma irradiation on bone. All bone specimens were subjected to the same microbial inactivation procedure. They were then separated into three groups, of which one was treated and not irradiated and two were exposed to 10 and 25 KGy of gamma radiation, respectively. SOS was measured using high- and low-frequency ultrasound beams in each orthogonal direction. SOS and Young modulus were altered significantly in the three groups, compared to native untreated bone. Exposure to 10 or 25 KGy had no noticeable effect on the study variables. The impact of irradiation was small compared to the effects of physical or chemical defatting.

Background: Essential molecular pathways such as the MAPK pathway, NO system, or the influence of PIK3CA as an oncogene are known to regulate fundamental signalling networks. However, few knowledge about their role in the occurrence of wound healing disorders (WHD) following radiation therapy (RT) exists. This study aims to evaluate the expression profiles of specific molecular pathway marker genes. Method(s): Expression profiles of the genes encoding MAPK, NOS1, NOS3, and PIK3CA were analyzed, by RT-PCR, in specimens from patients with and without a history of RT to the head and neck. Clinical data on the occurrence of cervical WHDs were analyzed. Result(s): Expression analysis of patients with postoperative WHDs revealed a significant increase in MAPK expression compared to the control group without occurrence of postoperative WHDs. PIK3CA showed a significantly increased expression in patients with a history of RT. Expression analysis of all other investigated genes did not reveal significant differences. Conclusion(s): This current study is able to show the influence of RT on different molecular pathways. This underlines the crucial role of specific molecular networks, responsible for the occurrence of long-term radiation toxicity such as WHDs. Additional studies should be carried out to identify possible starting points for therapeutic interventions.Copyright © The Author(s). 2017.",Included

2856,"Segmental Differences in Radiation-Induced Alterations of Tight Junction-Related Proteins in Non-Human Primate Jejunum, Ileum and Colon. Dysfunction of the intestinal epithelial barrier and leakage of luminal antigens and bacteria across the barrier have been linked to various human diseases. Intestinal permeability is regulated by intercellular structures, termed ""tight junction"" (Tj), which are disrupted after total-body irradiation (TBI). In this study, we investigated radiation-induced alterations in Tj-related proteins in the jejunum, ileum and colon of a non-human primate (NHP) model. NHPs were total-body irradiated with 6.7 and 7.4 Gy and intestines were procured at day 4, 7 and 12. Radiation exposure was found to induce significant increases in claudin-10 mRNA early (day 4) in all three gut segments and claudin-4 mRNA levels were repressed through day 12. TNF-alpha was highly induced in the jejunum and colon at early time points, but little induction was found in the ileum. Claudin-1 was induced only in the colon on day 4 postirradiation. Unlike the colon and jejunum, the ileum levels of claudin-7 were significantly downregulated through day 12 postirradiation. Western blot analysis revealed increased levels of claudin-2 on day 4 and of JAM-1 on day 7 postirradiation in all three gut segments. E-cadherin was downregulated on day 4 postirradiation in all segments, but remained reduced in the jejunum only until day 12. Taken together, these data suggest that exposure to radiation causes segment-specific alterations in the expression of Tj-related proteins. Interruption of Tjs may be a key factor contributing to injury to the intestinal mucosal barrier and increased intestinal permeability.",Included

Univariate analysis showed that the risk of local recurrence increased significantly with male sex (p less than 0.006), positive lymph nodes (p less than 0.01), vascular invasion (p less than 0.02), and Astler-Coller classification (p less than 0.05). Tumor located at less than 5 cm from the anal verge was significantly related to recurrence only in patients not receiving radiation therapy (p less than 0.02). Multivariate analysis including therapeutic modalities showed that local recurrence was significantly related with male sex (p less than 0.02), positive lymph nodes (p less than 0.01), and distance to anal verge (p less than 0.01). The beneficial role of radiation therapy appeared only for tumors located 5 cm or less from the anal verge. Prognostic scores were established using these variables and the effect of irradiation was evaluated according to these scores. Radiation therapy significatively reduced the risk of local recurrence in low-risk patients, i.e., female with low-lying tumor and with negative lymph nodes (p less than 0.03).

2867,"Multidrug resistance determinants in acute myeloid leukemia developed in persons exposed to ionizing radiation due to the Chernobyl accident. The results of multidrug resistance determinants expression analysis on leukemic cells of 56 acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients by immunophenotyping are presented. Of these, there were 21 persons exposed to ionizing radiation due to the Chemobyl accident with radiation-associated AML and 35 patients with spontaneous leukemia. The aim of this study was to determine if transport proteins (P-glycoprotein, LRP, and MDR1), apoptosis-related proteins (Fas, Bcl-2, Bax, p53, and Bcl-X(L)), and topoisomerase IIalpha expression in AML patients with the history of radiation exposure differed from those in spontaneous AML cases. Leukemic cells in patients with radiation-associated diseases compared to spontaneous AML more often overexpressed antiapoptotic oncoprotein Bcl-2 (12/21 vs. 6/35, p < 0.005) and less often demonstrated expression of Fas receptor (12/21 vs. 30/35, p < 0.05). Moreover, leukemic cells were simultaneously Fas negative and Bcl-2 positive in 4 out of 21 patients exposed to ionizing radiation but none of spontaneous cases had similar phenotype (p < 0.05). Leukemic cells in patients with radiation-associated AML compared to spontaneous cases more often were P-glycoprotein positive (12/20 vs 9/31, p < 0.05). P-glycoprotein overexpression significantly correlated with resistant disease in patients with radiation-associated AML (r = 0.47, p < 0.05), but was not a prognostic variable for the treatment outcome in terms of overall survival. Defects in pathways of drug-induced apoptosis and function of pump, that actively effluxes drugs could contribute significantly to developing drug resistance in radiation-associated AML.",Included

The inactivation of checkpoint genes by genetic and epigenetic mechanisms is frequent in all cancer types, as a less-efficient cell cycle control can lead to genetic instability and tumorigenesis. In an on-going case-control study consisting of 216 patients with non-small cell lung cancer, 226 population-based controls, and 114 hospital-based controls, we investigated the relationship of gamma-radiation-induced G2-M arrest and lung cancer risk. Peripheral blood lymphocytes were cultured for 90 hours, exposed to 1.0 Gy gamma-radiation, and harvested at 3 hours after gamma-radiation treatment. gamma-Radiation-induced G2-M arrest was measured as the percentage of mitotic cells in untreated cultures minus the percentage of mitotic cells in gamma-radiation-treated cultures from the same subject. The mean percentage of gamma-radiation-induced G2-M arrest was significantly lower in cases than in population controls (1.18 versus 1.44, P < 0.01) and hospital controls (1.18 versus 1.40, P = 0.01). When dichotomized at the 50th percentile value in combined controls (population and hospital controls), a lower level of gamma-radiation-induced G2-M arrest was associated with an increased risk of lung cancer among African Americans after adjusting for baseline mitotic index, age, gender, and pack-years of smoking [adjusted odd ratio (OR), 2.25; 95% confidence interval (95% CI), 0.97-5.20]. A significant trend of an increased risk of lung cancer with a decreased level of G2-M arrest was observed (P(trend) = 0.02) among African Americans, with a lowest-versus-highest quartile adjusted OR of 3.74 (95% CI, 0.98-14.3). This trend was most apparent among African American females (P(trend) < 0.01), with a lowest-versus-highest quartile adjusted OR of 11.75 (95% CI, 1.47-94.04). The results suggest that a less-efficient DNA damage-induced G2-M checkpoint is associated with an increased risk of lung cancer among African Americans. Interestingly, we observed a stronger association of DNA damage-induced G2-M arrest and lung cancer among African Americans when compared with Caucasians. If replicated, these results may provide clues to the exceedingly high lung cancer incidence experienced by African Americans.",Included

BACKGROUND: The safety of gamma knife radiosurgery should be considered when treating pituitary adenomas., OBJECTIVES: To determine the maximum tolerated dose of radiation delivered by gamma knife radiosurgery to optic nerves., METHODS: An animal model designed to establish prolonged balloon compression of the optic chiasm and parasellar region was developed to mimic the optic nerve compression caused by pituitary adenomas. Twenty cats underwent surgery to place a balloon for compression effect and 20 cats in a sham operation group received microsurgery without any treatment. The effects of gamma knife irradiation at 10-13 Gy on normal (sham operation group) and compressed (optic nerve compression group) optic nerves were investigated by pattern visual evoked potential examination and histopathology., RESULTS: Gamma knife radiosurgery at 10 Gy had almost no effect. At 11 Gy, P100 latency was significantly prolonged and P100 amplitude was significantly decreased in compressed optic nerves, but there was little change in the normal optic nerves. Doses of 11 Gy and higher induced significant electrophysiological variations and degeneration of the myelin sheath and axons in both normal and compressed optic nerves., CONCLUSIONS: Compressed optic nerves are more sensitive to gamma knife radiosurgery than normal optic nerves. The minimum dose of gamma knife radiosurgery that causes radiation injury in normal optic nerves is 12 Gy; however, the minimum dose is 11 Gy in compressed optic nerves. Copyright © 2013 S.

2960,"Faecal microbiota transplantation protects against radiation-induced toxicity. Severe radiation exposure may cause acute radiation syndrome, a possibly fatal condition requiring effective therapy. Gut microbiota can be manipulated to fight against many diseases. We explored whether intestinal microbe transplantation could alleviate radiation-induced toxicity. High-throughput sequencing showed that gastrointestinal bacterial community composition differed between male and female mice and was associated with susceptibility to radiation toxicity. Faecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) increased the survival rate of irradiated animals, elevated peripheral white blood cell counts and improved gastrointestinal tract function and intestinal epithelial integrity in irradiated male and female mice. FMT preserved the intestinal bacterial composition and retained mRNA and long non-coding RNA expression profiles of host small intestines in a sex-specific fashion. Despite promoting angiogenesis, sex-matched FMT did not accelerate the proliferation of cancer cells in vivo. FMT might serve as a therapeutic to mitigate radiation-induced toxicity and improve the prognosis of tumour patients after radiotherapy.Copyright © 2017 The Authors.

To address the question of whether radiation therapy is beneficial in the management of partially resected meningiomas, we reviewed the records of all patients admitted to the University of California, San Francisco, between 1968 and 1978 who had a diagnosis of intracranial meningioma. The patients were divided into three groups: 51 patients had gross total resection and did not receive radiation therapy, 30 patients had subtotal resection and no radiation therapy, and 54 patients had subtotal resection followed by radiation therapy. The subtotal resection groups were similar in average age, male:female ratio, and tumor location, which allowed a valid comparison of the effects of irradiation. The recurrence rate in the total resection group was 4% (2 of 51 patients). Among patients in the subtotal resection groups, 60% of nonirradiated patients had a recurrence, compared with only 32% of the irradiated patients. The median time to recurrence was significantly longer in the irradiated group than in the nonirradiated group (125 vs. 66 months, P less than 0.05). There was no complication related to irradiation.

2976,"Long-Term Cognitive Functioning in Single-Dose Total-Body Gamma-Irradiated Rhesus Monkeys ( Macaca mulatta ). In this study, the effects of a potentially lethal radiation exposure on the brain for long-term cognitive sequelae were investigated using Rhesus macaques ( Macaca mulatta ) adopted from other facilities after analysis of acute radiation response via the Centers for Medical Countermeasures against Radiation (CMCR) network. Fifty-nine animals were given the opportunity to participate in cognitive cage-side testing. The animals that received single-dose gamma irradiation were significantly less likely to engage in cognitive testing than the controls, suggesting that irradiated animals may have differences in cognitive ability. Five irradiated (6.75-8.05 Gy) and three naive control animals self-selected, were extensively trained and administered a simple visual discrimination with reversal (SVD+R) task 2-3 times per week for 11-18 months. Each session consisted of 30 trials in which the animals were required to choose the correct visual stimulus for a food reward. After the initial presentation, the stimulus that signaled the presence of food was twice reversed once the animal reached criterion (90% accuracy across four consecutive sessions). While the limited sample size precluded definitive statistical analysis, irradiated animals took longer to reach the criterion subsequent to reversal than did control animals, suggesting a relative deficiency in cognitive flexibility. These results provide preliminary data supporting the potential use of a nonhuman primate model to study radiation-induced, late-delayed cognitive deficits.",Included

The aim of this research was to evaluate the relationship between p53 protein levels and absorbed doses from in vitro irradiated human lymphocytes. For this, samples of blood from 23 donors were irradiated with 0.5; 1; 2; and 4 Gy from a Cobalt-60 source, and the percentages of lymphocytes expressing p53 were scored using Flow Cytometry. The subjects were divided into 3 groups, in accordance with the p53 levels expressed per radiation dose: low (Group I), high (Group II), and excessive levels (Group III). For all groups, the analyses showed that the p53 expression levels increase with the absorbed dose. Particularly for groups I and II, the correlation between this protein expression and the dose follows the linear-quadratic model, such as for radioinduced chromosomal aberrations. In conclusion, our findings indicate possible applications of this approach in evaluating individual radiosensitivity prior to radiotherapeutical procedures as well as in medical surveillance of occupationally exposed workers. Furthermore, due to the rapidity of flow-cytometric analyses, the methodology here employed would play an important role in emergency responses to a large-scale radiation incident where many people may have been exposed.",Included

The Chernobyl nuclear accident produced the largest unintended release of radionuclides in history, with dramatic consequences for humans and other organisms. Exposure to ionizing radiation is known to reduce circulating and stored levels of specific antioxidants in birds and humans, thus potentially increasing oxidative stress. However, overall effects of radioactive exposure on oxidative status have never been investigated in any free ranging vertebrate. We measured plasma antioxidant capacity and concentration of reactive oxygen metabolites in adult barn swallows (Hirundo rustica) from colonies with variable background radiation levels in the Chernobyl region in Ukraine and Belarus. We predicted that antioxidants would decrease while reactive oxygen metabolites would increase with exposure to increasing levels of radiation at the breeding sites. Consistent with this expectation, radiation level positively predicted plasma concentration of reactive oxygen metabolites, whereas no significant covariation was found with non-enzymatic plasma antioxidant capacity. An index of oxidative stress was also larger in barn swallows exposed to high contamination levels. Thus, radioactive contamination appeared to be responsible for the increased generation of reactive oxygen metabolites and the imbalance between reactive oxygen metabolites and non-enzymatic plasma antioxidant capacity. © 2009 Elsevier Inc.

Time resolved data of DNA damage and repair after radiotherapy elucidates the relation between damage, repair, and cell survival. While well characterized in vitro, little is known about the time-course of DNA damage response in tumors sampled from individual patients. Kinetics of DNA damage after radiotherapy was assessed in eight dogs using repeated in vivo samples of tumor and co-irradiated normal tissue analyzed with comet assay and phosphorylated H2AX (gammaH2AX) immunohistochemistry. In vivo results were then compared (in silico) with a dynamic mathematical model for DNA damage formation and repair. Maximum %DNA in tail was observed at 15-60 min after irradiation, with a rapid decrease. Time-courses of gammaH2AX-foci paralleled these findings with a small time delay and were not influenced by covariates. The evolutionary parameter search based on %DNA in tail revealed a good fit of the DNA repair model to in vivo data for pooled sarcoma time-courses, but fits for individual sarcoma time-courses suffer from the heterogeneous nature of the in vivo data. It was possible to follow dynamics of comet tail intensity and gammaH2AX-foci during a course of radiation using a minimally invasive approach. DNA repair can be quantitatively investigated as time-courses of individual patients by integrating this resulting data into a dynamic mathematical model.Copyright © 2017 by the authors.

PURPOSE: Different doses of X-ray radiation were tested to assess the developmental inhibition effects on different stages of Drosophila suzukii, spotted wing drosophila (SWD). Efficacy of a potential quarantine treatment dose was evaluated for its practicality by a small scale-up validation test at a commercial facility., MATERIALS AND METHODS: X-ray treatments at different doses of 50, 100, 200, and 300 Gy were carried out with eggs, larvae, pupae and adults of SWD. The trial at the commercial facility was performed with pupae at 150 Gy., RESULTS: X-ray radiation inhibited development of all stages of SWD, and the estimated dose to cause 99% mortality or to prevent emergence (ED99) are reported here. Irradiation to eggs inhibited hatching, pupariation and adult emergence at 1962, 649 and 31 Gy, respectively. The inhibition of irradiated larvae to adult emergence was 66 Gy. Irradiation to pupae could not inhibit adult emergence completely even at 300 Gy. However, irradiation at 100 Gy and above induced complete adult sterility. Irradiation to pupae inhibited hatching of F1 eggs at 73 Gy, while for adults, total inhibition of F1 egg hatching was observed at 822 Gy. In the trial at the commercial facility, radiation at 150 Gy to pupae induced complete adult sterility in all combinations of cross-mating between treated or untreated males and females., CONCLUSION: This study suggests that X-ray radiation can be recommended as an alternative to methyl bromide as phytosanitary treatment for quarantine purpose.",Included

Age- and gender-related changes in malondialdehyde (MDA) levels, superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase (CAT) activities in rat livers exposed to different doses of whole-body gamma-ray radiation were determined. In addition, the effects of exogenous glutathione (GSH) against radiation injury in rat livers were investigated. We found that MDA levels have an age-associated increment and an increasing radiation dose-related elevation, although they decrease slightly in the 4 Gy group. The MDA levels in old rats were lower in males than in females, while those of young rats did not change. There were no observed age-related changes in SOD activities, although male rats had higher SOD activity than females. Female rats had the highest CAT activities in the 4 Gy group, while male rats had the highest CAT activities in the 6 Gy group. CAT activities in the 8 Gy group were lower than those of the 2 Gy group for each gender and age. While MDA levels were decreased and CAT activities increased by GSH, SOD activities remained unchanged. The results indicate that gamma-ray radiation affects gender- and age-dependent MDA levels, SOD and CAT activities.

An inception cohort was defined which included 4,523 workers in employment between 1972-96 to examine cancer incidence. Cancer registrations in the inception cohort were identified to 1996 through electronic linkage of records with the NSW and the Australian national registers of cancer incidence. All-cancer incidence in workers at LHSTC was 15% below the NSW rates [SIR=0.85; 95% CI=(0.75, 0.95)]. Of 37 specific cancers and groups of cancers examined, statistically significant excesses relative to NSW rates were observed only for pleural cancer incidence [SIR=17.71; 95%=(7.96, 39.43)], and for incidence of cancer of the small intestine [SIR=4.34; 95% CI=(1.40, 13.46)]. This study gives little evidence of an increased risk of cancers associated with radiation exposure in a cohort of nuclear workers in Australia.

Additionally, cell proliferation, cell cycle and cell apoptosis were all analyzed in irradiated or sham-irradiated cells., RESULTS: Among the five antisense compounds (AS), AS3 was identified to efficiently inhibit p53 mRNA level and protein content. Interestingly, AS3 transfer has little effect on cell proliferation in DU-145 cells (mutant p53) after ionizing radiation (IR). In contrast, a marked increase of cell apoptosis and growth inhibition were observed in MCF-7 cells (wild-type p53), suggesting that AS3 can increase radiosensitivity of MCF-7 cells. Additionally, it was also observed that the transfection of AS3 decreased the fraction of G1 phase cells, and increased the proportion of S phase cells compared to untreated cells 24 h after IR in MCF-7 cell lines., CONCLUSION: AS3 transfection increases MCF-7 cell apoptosis induced by 5 Gy-radiation, and this mechanism may be closely associated with abrogation of G1 phase arrest.",Included

BACKGROUND In the current study, the authors sought to evaluate outcomes, specifically with respect to adjuvant radiotherapy (RT), for patients with desmoplastic melanoma. METHODS The records of 130 consecutive patients who presented between 1985 and 2009 with nonmetastatic desmoplastic melanoma and were treated curatively with either surgery alone (59 patients; 45%) or surgery and postoperative RT (71 patients; 55%) were retrospectively reviewed. Ages ranged from 21 years to 97 years (median age, 66 years). The location of the primary tumor was in the head and neck region in 62% of patients. Only 5 patients (4%) had lymph node involvement at the time of presentation. RESULTS The median follow-up was 6.6 years (range, 11 months-24 years). Overall survival rates at 5 years and 10 years were 69% and 53%, respectively. Disease-specific survival rates were 84% and 80%, respectively, at 5 years and 10 years. The actuarial rate of local recurrence was 17% at 5 years and beyond. Of the patients who underwent surgery without receiving postoperative RT, 14 (24%) experienced local recurrence. Of the 71 patients treated with surgery and postoperative RT, 5 (7%) experienced local recurrence.

3245,"Do radiation-induced bystander effects correlate to the intrinsic radiosensitivity of individuals and have clinical significance?. It is well known that patients can vary in their normal tissue response to radiotherapy, and this can be problematic. As a result, radiobiologists have been using in vitro models to assess variation in response and elucidate the genetic determinants of this variation. However, the clinical relevance of these models is currently unknown. In this study, blood samples from healthy controls (n 20) and colorectal carcinoma patients (n 60) were cultured in vitro to assess two radiobiological end points in parallel: intrinsic radiosensitivity assayed by chromosomal aberrations (G2 scores) and radiation-induced bystander effects assayed by viability testing. Increased intrinsic radiosensitivity was observed in colorectal carcinoma donors (55) compared to the healthy donors (5) (P < 0.005). Similarly, more pronounced radiation-induced bystander effects were observed in the colorectal carcinoma donors compared to the healthy donors after 24 h exposure but not after 96 h exposure to donor irradiated cell conditioned medium (ICCM) (P < 0.05). All scores were tested for correlation with the age, sex and clinical stage of the colorectal carcinoma patients. The only statistically significant correlation was found in samples from severe Dukes D patients (P < 0.005), which had low/radioresistant G2 scores. No correlation was found between radiation-induced intrinsic sensitivity and bystander effects, which suggests that they may have separate underlying molecular mechanisms, but they both show clinical relevance in individual patient samples. © 2009 The Radiation Research Society.",Included

As multiple spacefaring nations contemplate extended manned missions to Mars and the Moon, health risks could be elevated as travel goes beyond the Earth's protective magnetosphere into the more intense deep space radiation environment. The primary purpose of this study was to determine whether mortality rates due to cardiovascular disease (CVD), cancer, accidents and all other causes of death differ in (1) astronauts who never flew orbital missions in space, (2) astronauts who flew only in low Earth orbit (LEO), and (3) Apollo lunar astronauts, the only humans to have traveled beyond Earth's magnetosphere. Results show there were no differences in CVD mortality rate between non-flight (9%) and LEO (11%) astronauts. However, the CVD mortality rate among Apollo lunar astronauts (43%) was 4-5 times higher than in non-flight and LEO astronauts. To test a possible mechanistic basis for these findings, a secondary purpose was to determine the long-term effects of simulated weightlessness and space-relevant total-body irradiation on vascular responsiveness in mice. The results demonstrate that space-relevant irradiation induces a sustained vascular endothelial cell dysfunction. Such impairment is known to lead to occlusive artery disease, and may be an important risk factor for CVD among astronauts exposed to deep space radiation.",Included

Testing included cyclic loading at 0.5 Hz for 100 cycles from 50 to 200 N and failure testing at a strain rate of 10% per second. Cyclic elongation did not change significantly (P = .151) with irradiation, increasing from a mean +/- SD of 9.4 +/- 2.1 mm to 11.3 +/- 3.4 mm. Cyclic creep strain approached a significant increase with irradiation (1.3% +/- 0.8% to 2.6% +/- 1.5%; P = .076). Failure testing was not affected with irradiation with regard to maximum load (1680 +/- 417 mm to 1494 +/- 435 mm), maximum stress (40.8 +/- 10.6 MPa to 37.5 +/- 15.7 MPa), elongation (7.85 +/- 1.35 mm to 8.67 +/- 2.05 mm), or strain at maximum stress (0.158 +/- 0.03 to 0.175 +/- 0.03). Graft stiffness significantly decreased by 20% with irradiation (278 +/- 67 N/mm to 221 +/- 50 N/mm; P = .035). Low-dose (1.0-1.2 Mrad) gamma irradiation decreases BTB graft stiffness by 20%, but it does not affect other failure or cyclic parameters. Aside from graft stiffness during load to failure testing, low-dose (1.0-1.2 Mrad) gamma irradiation of central-third human BTB allografts is not deleterious to preimplantation biomechanical properties.",Included

PURPOSE: Our previous study showed that radiation exposure reduced the diversity of repertoires of memory thymus-derived cells (T cells) with cluster of differentiation (CD)- 4 among atomic-bomb (A-bomb) survivors. To evaluate the maintenance of T-cell memory within A-bomb survivors 60 years after radiation exposure, we examined functionally distinct memory CD4 T-cell subsets in the peripheral blood lymphocytes of the survivors., METHODS: Three functionally different subsets of memory CD4 T cells were identified by differential CD43 expression levels and measured using flow cytometry. These subsets consist of functionally mature memory cells, cells weakly responsive to antigenic stimulation, and those cells functionally anergic and prone to spontaneous apoptosis., RESULTS: The percentages of these subsets within the peripheral blood CD4 T-cell pool all significantly increased with age. Percentages of functionally weak and anergic subsets were also found to increase with radiation dose, fitting to a log linear model. Within the memory CD4 T-cell pool, however, there was an inverse association between radiation dose and the percentage of functionally mature memory cells., CONCLUSION: These results suggest that the steady state of T cell memory, which is regulated by cell activation and/or cell survival processes in subsets, may have been perturbed by prior radiation exposure among A-bomb survivors.",Included

Radiation therapy is a widely used treatment for malignant central nervous system tumors. Mature neurons are terminally differentiated, whereas stem and progenitor cells have a prominent proliferative capacity and are therefore highly vulnerable to irradiation. Our aim was to investigate how cranial radiation in young rats would affect stem/progenitor cells in the two niches of adult neurogenesis, the subventricular zone (SVZ) and the dentate gyrus of the hippocampal formation. Nine weeks after irradiation we found that in irradiated animals, hippocampal neurogenesis was reduced to 5% of control levels. Similarly, the numbers of actively proliferating cells and radial glia-like stem cells (nestin+/glial fibrillary acidic protein [GFAP]+) in the dentate gyrus were reduced to 10% and 15% of control levels, respectively. In the irradiated olfactory bulb, neurogenesis was reduced to 40% of control levels, and the number of actively proliferating cells in the SVZ was reduced to 53% of control levels. However, the number of nestin+/GFAP+ cells in the SVZ was unchanged compared with controls. To evaluate the immediate response to the radiation injury, we quantified the amount of proliferation in the SVZ and dentate gyrus 1 day after irradiation. We found an equal reduction in proliferating cells both in dentate gyrus and SVZ. In summary, we show an initial response to radiation injury that is similar in both brain stem cell niches. However, the long-term effects on stem cells and neurogenesis in these two areas differ significantly: the dentate gyrus is severely affected long-term, whereas the SVZ appears to recover with time.",Included

Deep space exploration will require real-time, minimally invasive monitoring of astronaut health to mitigate the potential health impairments caused by space radiation and microgravity. Genotoxic stress in humans can be monitored by quantifying the amount of DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) in immune cells from a simple finger prick. In a cohort of 674 healthy donors, we show that the endogenous level of DSBs increases with age and with latent cytomegalovirus infection. To map the range of human responses to space radiation, we then study DSB induction and repair in immune cells from 319 healthy donors after the cells are exposed to galactic cosmic ray components and lymphocytes from 30 cancer patients after radiotherapy. Individuals with low baseline DSB have fewer clinical complications, enhanced DNA damage repair responses, and a functional dose-dependent cytokine response in healthy donor cells. This supports the use of DSB monitoring for health resilience in space., Pariset et al. find that individuals with a lower baseline level of DNA damage are resilient to clinical complications after radiotherapy and present higher radiation-induced levels of DNA repair foci and inflammatory cytokines. These findings support the use of baseline DNA damage as a biomarker for radiation sensitivity.Copyright © 2020",Included
3498,"Comparative stochastic effects of inhaled alpha- and beta-particle- emitting radionuclides in beagle dogs. The stochastic effects of inhaled, insoluble particles of alpha- or beta- particle-emitting radionuclides were compared in dogs. Male and female beagle dogs were exposed briefly by nasal inhalation to relatively insoluble aerosols of 239PuO2 or 144Ce in fused aluminosilicate particles (FAP) and observed for cancer for their lifetimes. The initial lung burden and retention of each radionuclide was determined by whole-body counting of the emissions from 144Ce-144Pr- or 169Yb-labeled 239PuO2. Lung doses were calculated for each dog from these data. The lung doses ranged from 0.21 to 1200 Gy for 144Ce FAP and 1.6 to 58 Gy for 239PuO2. Dogs with doses to the lung of about 60 Gy or greater from 144Ce or about 2 Gy or greater from 239PuO2 had an increased incidence of lung carcinomas. In dogs exposed to 144Ce FAP, three organs were targets for neoplasia: lung, tracheobronchial lymph nodes, and heart. The insoluble FAP carried to the lymph nodes draining the lung delivered high radiation doses to the nodes and adjacent heart, resulting in hemangiosarcomas of these organs. In the lung, high radiation doses induced hemangiosarcomas and carcinosarcomas. At lower doses, carcinomas of various histological patterns were induced in the lung. In dogs exposed to 239PuO2, the lung was the sole target organ for neoplasia. Nearly all of these neoplasms were carcinomas of various histological patterns. These results indicated that relatively low doses of alpha-particle radiation can induce pulmonary cancers, but relatively large doses of beta-particle radiation are required. In addition, inhaled beta-particle emitters can also induce cancers in lung-associated lymph nodes and heart at these larger absorbed radiation doses.",Included

The Janus series of radiation experiments, conducted from 1970 to 1992, explored the effects of gamma and neutron radiation on animal lifespan and disease development. Data from these experiments presents an opportunity to conduct a large scale analysis of both tumor and non-tumor disease development. This work was focused on a subset of animals from the Janus series of experiments, comparing acute or fractionated exposures of gamma or neutron radiation on the hazards associated with the development of tumor and non-tumor diseases of the liver, lung, kidney or vascular system. This study also examines how the co-occurrence of non-tumor diseases may affect tumor-associated hazards. While exposure to radiation increases the hazard of dying with tumor and non-tumor diseases, dose fractionation modulates these hazards, which varies across different organ systems. Finally, the effect that concurrent non-cancer diseases have on the hazard of dying with a tumor also differs by organ system. These results highlight the complexity in the effects of radiation on the liver, lung, kidney and vascular system.",Included
3537,"Risk of stomach cancer incidence in a cohort of Mayak PA workers occupationally exposed to ionizing radiation. Stomach cancer is a widespread health condition associated with environmental and genetic factors. Contribution of ionizing radiation to stomach cancer etiology is not sufficiently studied. This study was aimed to assess an association of the stomach cancer incidence risk with doses from occupational radiation exposure in a cohort of workers hired at main Mayak production association facilities in 1948-1982 taking into account non-radiation factors including digestive disorders. The study cohort comprised 22,377 individuals and by 31.12.2013 343 stomach cancer diagnoses had been reported among the cohort members. Occupational stomach absorbed doses were provided by the Mayak Worker Dosimetry System- 2008 (MWDS-2008) for external gamma ray exposure and by the Mayak Worker Dosimetry System- 2013 (MWDS-2013) for internal exposure to plutonium. Excess relative risks (ERR) per Gy for stomach cancer were estimated using the Poisson's regression. Analyses were run using the AMFIT module of the EPICURE software. The stomach cancer incidence risk in the study cohort was found to be significantly associated with the stomach absorbed dose of gamma rays: ERR/Gy = 0.19 (95% CI: 0.01, 0.44) with a 0 year lag, and ERR/Gy = 0.20 (95% CI: 0.01, 0.45) with a 5 year lag. To estimate the baseline risk, sex, attained age, smoking status and alcohol consumption, chronic diseases (peptic ulcer, gastritis and duodenitis) were taken into account. No modifications of the radiogenic risk by non-radiation factors were found in the study worker cohort. No association of the stomach cancer incidence risk with internal exposure to incorporated plutonium was observed.Copyright: © 2020 Zhuntova et al.

Although radon is a well-established contributor to lung cancer mortality among uranium miners, the effects of radon decay products on different histopathologies of lung carcinoma are not well established. Using a retrospective cohort design, this study aims to examine the risks of lung cancer by histological subtypes associated with exposure to radon decay products among the Ontario Uranium Miners cohort. Cases were stratified by histological groups, and associated risks were estimated for cumulative radon exposure after adjustment for attained age and calendar period. Between 1969 and 2005, 1274 incident cases of primary lung cancer were identified. Of these, 1256 diagnoses (99%) contained information on histology. Squamous cell carcinoma was most common (31%), followed by adenocarcinoma (20%), large cells (18%), small cell lung carcinoma (14%), and other or unspecified cell types (17%). Of the histological sub-groups, small cell lung carcinoma had the strongest association with cumulative radon exposure; compared to the reference group (<1 cumulative working level months (WLM)), the highest exposure category (>60 cumulative WLM) had a relative risk (RR) of 2.76 (95% CI: 1.67-4.57). Adenocarcinoma had the lowest risk and was not significantly associated with exposure to radon decay products (RR = 1.49, 95% CI: 0.96-2.31). An increasing, linear trend in relative risk was noted with increasing cumulative WLM across small cell, squamous cell, and large cell lung carcinomas (Ptrend < 0.05). Similarly, the excess relative risk (ERR) per WLM was highest for small cell lung carcinoma (ERR/WLM = 0.15, p < 0.01), followed by squamous cell carcinoma (ERR/WLM = 0.12, p < 0.01). Non-statistically significant excess risk was observed for adenocarcinoma (ERR/WLM = 0.004, p = 0.07). Our analysis of the Ontario Uranium Miners cohort data shows differences in the magnitude of the risks across four histological subtypes of lung carcinoma; the strongest association was noted for small cell lung carcinoma, followed by squamous cell, large cell, and lastly adenocarcinoma, which showed no significant associations with exposure to radon decay products.",Included
3594,"Multilocus inheritance determines predisposition to alpha-radiation induced bone tumourigenesis in mice. In a recent study, we presented evidence for genetic predisposition governing radiation osteosarcomagenesis in mice. Following the incorporation of the bone-seeking alpha emitter 227Th, approximately 25% of the variance in osteosarcoma incidence was determined by inherited genetic factors. We have now mapped 5 susceptibility loci in crosses between the more susceptible BALB/c and the more resistant CBA/Ca strains. The major QTL on chromosome 14 overlaps with a locus that was already found in our previous study, using different strains of mice. Here, we investigate the effect by which the major susceptibility locus and 4 minor modifier loci interact to influence osteosarcoma predisposition. Following incorporation of the bone-seeking isotope, 100% of mice that harbour high-risk genotypes at all 5 susceptibility loci develop osteosarcoma with an average of 472 days latency times. In 10 mice inheriting exclusively low-risk genotypes only 1 osteosarcoma was found, arising after 733 days latency time. Inheritance of distinct combinations of BALB/c and CBA/Ca alleles at the susceptibility loci confer more extreme phenotypes in terms of susceptibility or resistance than observed in either of the two parental inbred strains. From the present study, we demonstrate that additive effects of multiple alleles, each making only a minor phenotypic contribution, can combine and significantly alter tumour risk. This mechanism can be of particular importance in genetically heterogeneous populations such as man. Copyright 2005 Wiley-Liss, Inc.",Included

The risk of radiation-induced nodules is higher than the risk for radiation-induced cancer. Risk factors and specific modifiers of the dose-response relationship may vary among different populations and not be well recognized. Many thyroid studies have considered thyroid nodularity itself, but not specific morphological types of thyroid nodules. There are many specific types of thyroid nodules which follow a morphological classification of thyroid lesions, including some congenital and tumor-like conditions. Modern equipment and technique can help us to identify particular specific types of thyroid nodules. In this study we report some results of a clinically applicable approach to materials derived from three studies. From 1999 through 2002, we have screened 571 current residents from 4 exposed and 1 control village near the Semipalatinsk Nuclear Test Site area, who were of similar ages (<20) at the time of major radiation fallout events at the SNTS. Prevalent nodules were identified by ultrasound and fine-needle aspiration biopsy, cytopathology results. Analysis of ultrasound images and cytopathology of thyroid lesions among exposed and non-exposed population allowed us to distinguish some interesting ultrasound features for specific types of thyroid nodules.

Despite variations in the qualitative observations, there was a marked difference in two of the schedules between damage expressed as crypt counts and that described by the qualitative techniques. In the first case high crypt numbers were associated with severe mucosal damage, whereas the second schedule produced a reduced crypt count in association with low damage to the surface mucosa. A third schedule produced results in which there was a general agreement between low crypt numbers and considerable surface mucosal damage. However, observations were made of mucosal formations not previously seen on damaged mucosal surfaces. These resembled the appearance normally associated with the gut of patients suffering from coeliac disease. Variations in the qualitative observations were seen in all the schedules so that their interpretation in terms of perturbation of cellular kinetics is difficult.",Included

3669,"The lack of cytotoxic effect and radioadaptive response in splenocytes of mice exposed to low level internal beta-particle irradiation through tritiated drinking water in vivo. Health effects of tritium, a beta-emitter and a by-product of the nuclear industry, is a subject of significant controversy. This mouse in vivo study was undertaken to monitor biological effects of low level tritium exposure. Mice were exposed to tritiated drinking water (HTO) at 10 KBq/L, 1 MBq/L and 20 MBq/L concentrations for one month. The treatment did not result in a significant increase of apoptosis in splenocytes. To examine if this low level tritium exposure alters radiosensitivity, the extracted splenocytes were challenged in vitro with 2 Gy gamma-radiation, and apoptotic responses at 1 and 24 h were measured. No alterations in the radiosensitivity were detected in cells from mice exposed to tritium compared to sham-treated mice. In contrast, low dose gamma-irradiation at 20 or 100 mGy, resulted in a significant increase in resistance to apoptotic cell death after 2 Gy irradiation; an indication of the radioadaptive response. Overall, our data suggest that low concentrations of tritium given to mice as HTO in drinking water do not exert cytotoxic effect in splenocytes, nor do they change cellular sensitivity to additional high dose gamma-radiation. The latter may be considered as the lack of a radioadaptive response, typically observed after low dose gamma-irradiation. © 2013 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.",Included

Worms were exposed to 0, 10, 25, 45, 75, and 105 krad of gamma radiation from a 137cesium source and cultured in vitro for 10 days. Irradiation reduced production of microfilariae in a dose-dependent manner. Embryograms of irradiated female worms showed dose-related abnormalities with arrested development at the early embryo stage. Irradiation reduced the viability of adult worms in a dose-dependent manner, but no lethal effect was observed. Electron microscopy studies showed that irradiation cleared Wolbachia from worm tissues. Real-time polymerase chain reaction studies demonstrated greatly reduced Wolbachia DNA in irradiated worms. These effects are essentially the same as those observed in adult worms treated with doxycycline. These studies suggest that effects of irradiation on reproduction in Brugia malayi may be caused by effects of irradiation on Wolbachia.",Included

Experimental animals were exposed to radiation generated by a linear accelerator at the chest and killed after 3 months. Heart tissues from these animals were removed for Masson staining, PPAR-gamma immunohistochemical staining, Western blot analysis and real-time polymerase chain reaction assay (RT-PCR). In addition, the protein expression of matrix metalloprotein-1 (MMP-1), tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase-1 (TIMP-1) and transforming growth factor type beta1 (TGF-beta1), all of which are associated with fibrosis, was measured. Masson staining revealed significant myocardial fibrosis, degeneration and necrosis in rats exposed to radiation. The results of immunohistochemical staining and Western blot analysis showed that PPAR-gamma protein expression in hearts of the irradiation groups was significantly higher than in the control group, especially in myocardium and vascular endothelial (p < 0.05). RT-PCR results also showed a parallel increase in PPAR-gamma mRNA expression in the heart of the irradiation groups compared with the control group (p < 0.05). The expression of MMP-1 protein was not significantly different in three groups (p > 0.05). The expression of TIMP-1 and TGF-beta1 proteins was, however, higher in two irradiation groups than in the control group (p < 0.05). These data demonstrate that PPAR-gamma expression is up-regulated on both mRNA and protein levels in heart injured by radiation.

OBJECT: Cranial CT (CCT) scans and hospital admission are increasingly performed to rule out intracranial hemorrhage in patients after minor head injury (MHI), particularly in older patients and in those receiving antiplatelet therapy. This leads to high radiation exposure and a growing financial burden. The aim of this study was to determine whether the astroglial-derived protein S100B that is released into blood can be used as a reliable negative predictive tool for intracranial bleeding in patients after MHI, when they are older than 65 years or being treated with antiplatelet drugs (low-dose aspirin, clopidogrel)., METHODS: The authors conducted a prospective observational study in 2 trauma hospitals. A total of 782 patients with MHI (Glasgow Coma Scale Score 13-15) who were on medication with platelet aggregation inhibitors (PAIs) or were age 65 years and older, independent of antiplatelet therapy, were included. Clinical examination, bloodwork, observation, and CCT were performed in the traumatology emergency departments. When necessary, patients were admitted and observation took place on the ward; in these patients, CCT was performed during their hospital stay. Patients with severe trauma, focal neurological deficits, posttraumatic seizures, anticoagulant therapy, alcohol intoxication, coagulation disorder, blood sampling more than 3 hours after trauma, and unknown time of the trauma were excluded from the study. The median age of the patients was 83 years, and 69% were female. Sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values of S100B with reference to CCT findings were calculated. The cutoff of S100B was set at 0.105 mug/L., RESULTS: Of the 782 patients, 50 (6.4%) had intracranial bleeding. One patient with positive results on CCT scan showed an S100B level below 0.105 mug/L. Of all patients, 33.1% were below the cutoff. S100B showed a sensitivity of 98.0% (CI 89.5%-99.7%), a negative predictive value of 99.6% (CI 97.9%-99.9%), a specificity of 35.3% (CI 31.9%- 38.8%), and a positive predictive value of 9.4% (CI 7.2%-12.2%)., CONCLUSIONS: Levels of S100B below 0.105 mug/L can accurately predict normal CCT findings after MHI in older patients and in those treated with PAIs. Combining conventional decision criteria with measurement of S100B can reduce the CCT scan and hospital admission rates by approximately 30%.",Excluded

We aimed to examine oral GTC cutaneous uptake, ability to protect human skin against erythema induced by a UVR dose range and impact on potent cyclo-oxygenase- and lipoxygenase-produced mediators of UVR inflammation, PGE2 and 12-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid (12-HETE), respectively. In an open oral intervention study, sixteen healthy human subjects (phototype I/II) were given low-dose GTC (540 mg) with vitamin C (50 mg) daily for 12 weeks. Pre- and post-supplementation, the buttock skin was exposed to UVR and the resultant erythema quantified. Skin blister fluid and biopsies were taken from the unexposed and the UVR-exposed skin 24 h after a pro-inflammatory UVR challenge (three minimal erythema doses). Urine, skin tissue and fluid were analysed for catechin content and skin fluid for PGE2 and 12-HETE by liquid chromatography coupled to tandem MS. A total of fourteen completing subjects were supplement compliant (twelve female, median 42.5 years, range 29-59 years). Benzoic acid levels were increased in skin fluid post-supplementation (P= 0.03), and methylated gallic acid and several intact catechins and hydroxyphenyl-valerolactones were detected in the skin tissue and fluid. AUC analysis for UVR erythema revealed reduced response post-GTC (P= 0.037). Pre-supplementation, PGE2 and 12-HETE were UVR induced (P= 0.003, 0.0001). After GTC, UVR-induced 12-HETE reduced from mean 64 (sd 42) to 41 (sd 32) pg/mul (P= 0.01), while PGE2 was unaltered. Thus, GTC intake results in the incorporation of catechin metabolites into human skin associated with abrogated UVR-induced 12-HETE; this may contribute to protection against sunburn inflammation and potentially longer-term UVR-mediated damage.",Excluded
2457,"Postoperative radiotherapy of glioblastoma multiforme: analysis and critical assessment of different treatment strategies and predictive factors. BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Different factors influence glioblastoma patients' prognosis. The aim of this retrospective, explorative analysis was to define the role of recent treatment strategies and to examine the value of different prognostic factors., PATIENTS AND METHODS: A total of 110 patients was analyzed. Complete resection, partial resection, and biopsy was accomplished in 69, 22, and 19 patients, respectively. 56 patients received conventionally fractionated radiotherapy with a median total dose of 60 Gy, 2 Gy daily. 54 patients received hyperfractionated accelerated radiotherapy with a median total dose of 54 Gy, 2 x 1.8 Gy daily. 20 patients had concomitant temozolomide (50-75 mg/m2/d), and 20 patients concomitant topotecan (0.5 mg/m2 as continuous venous infusion over 21 days). 37 patients received temozolomide as salvage therapy., RESULTS: Median overall (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS) were 8.7 and 4.8 months. After complete resection, partial resection, and biopsy, OS was 9.5, 8.5, and 5.5 months, respectively. OS was 8.5, 13.8, and 8.2 months for radiotherapy alone, concomitant temozolomide, and concomitant topotecan, respectively. Hazard ratio was 0.29 (OS; p = 0.002) and 0.32 (DFS; p = 0.003) for concomitant temozolomide compared to radiotherapy alone. Topotecan led to an increased toxicity. With 9.7 months for conventionally fractionated radiotherapy and 8.1 months for hyperfractionated radiotherapy, OS differed significantly (p = 0.003, log-rank test). OS in patients with RPA (recursive partitioning analysis) score III, IV, V, and VI was 14.1, 10, 9.5, and 5.8 months (p = 0.003, log-rank test). In the univariate (p = 0.0001, log-rank test) and multivariate analysis (p = 0.002, Cox regression), salvage temozolomide led to a statistically significant survival benefit (10.6 vs. 7.7 months)., CONCLUSION: Concomitant topotecan or the use of hyperfractionated radiotherapy did not show to be superior in outcome in this retrospective analysis. Topotecan led to an increased toxicity. An attempt at complete resection is justified. Temozolomide should be integrated in therapy initially. As salvage therapy, temozolomide is also effective.",Excluded
383,"Is there a role for Ytrrium-90 in the treatment of unresectable and metastatic intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma?. Background: Selective internal radiation therapy (SIRT) with Ytrrium-90 (Y-90) has been used to treat hepatic malignancies with success. This study focuses on the efficacy and safety of Y-90 in the treatment of unresectable and metastatic intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (ICC). Method(s): A single-institution retrospective case review was performed for patients with unresectable and metastatic ICC treated with Y-90 between 2006 and 2016. Result(s): Seventeen patients with ICC underwent 21 Y-90 treatments. Four patients had undergone prior liver resection, and six patients had extrahepatic disease at the time of treatment. Five year overall survival was 26.8%, with a median survival of 33.6 months. One patient underwent margin negative liver resection after a single treatment. Complications were appreciated in two cases. Ninety-day mortality was 0%. Conclusion(s): Treatment of ICC using Y-90 is a safe and promising procedure. Further research is needed to clarify its role in the treatment of unresectable and metastatic ICC.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Inc.",Excluded
2911,"Drug exposure and risk of microscopic colitis: a nationwide Danish case-control study with 5751 cases. BACKGROUND: Previous small studies have indicated that commonly prescribed drugs may be associated with microscopic colitis (MC). With an increasing incidence of MC, it is important to explore the association between exposure to proton pump inhibitors (PPIs), nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, statins, and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors and MC in a larger setting., METHODS: Case-control study based on nationwide Danish registries. The study included all patients with MC diagnosis during the period 2005 to 2011. One hundred sex- and age-matched controls per case were randomly selected among the Danish population. Prescriptions were recorded in a Prescription Register in the year before the first recorded MC diagnosis. Effect measure is the adjusted odds ratio (OR) of collagenous colitis (CC) and lymphocytic colitis (LC) according to prescriptions of PPIs, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, statins, and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors. Within the control group, we identified a subgroup with MC-free colonic biopsies., RESULTS: We identified 3474 patients with CC and 2277 with LC and found a positive association between redemption of prescriptions for PPIs and both CC (OR = 7.04; 95% confidence interval, 6.55-7.56) and LC (OR = 3.37; 95% confidence interval, 3.08-3.69). Among patients with MC-free colon biopsies in the control group, the association between PPIs and CC was strongly positive (OR = 3.47; 95% confidence interval, 3.08-3.89). Adding this parameter to the model attenuated all of the associations, but they remained positive for PPIs versus CC and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors versus LC., CONCLUSIONS: We found positive associations between exposure to all 4 medication classes and MC. Variations in endoscopic frequency by drug category indicate a potential impact of bias.",Excluded
2582,"Neuropathology of intracranial arteriovenous malformations following conventional radiation therapy. Conventional fractionated radiation therapy was used in 15 patients to treat arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) of the brain deemed inoperable or incompletely obliterated using endovascular or surgical techniques. The AVMs measured from 0.8 to 85 cm3 (mean 28.2 cm3; median 24 cm3). Angiography in 12 patients 1-21 years following radiation therapy demonstrated no significant change in 7, slight reduction in 2, near complete obliteration in 1, and complete obliteration in 2. Magnetic resonance imaging further demonstrated apparent obliteration in one other case. Three irradiated AVMs were available for pathological examination following fatal recurrent hemorrhage after 21 years in case 1 and following surgery after 5 years in cases 2 and 3. Doses of 20 and 45 Gy were delivered to the area of the AVM in 10 and 15 fractions with a 6-MV linear accelerator in case 1 and in cases 2 and 3, respectively. A blinded histopathological comparison was made of the latter cases and three AVMs removed at surgery that were not previously irradiated and that were comparable in size, number of arterial feeders, and location within the brain. Segmental hyalinization of some blood vessels was seen in both irradiated and nonirradiated cases. The single postmortem specimen showed extensive thrombosis but a patent nidus. The findings are in keeping with the clinical impression that conventional fractionated radiation therapy fails to alter the natural history of cerebral AVMs. The favorable outcome of radiosurgery on small- to medium-sized AVMs appears attributable to the shorter duration of therapy using relatively high-dose prescriptions to the nidus.",Excluded
3574,"Predictive value of skin invasion in recurrent head and neck cancer patients treated by hypofractionated stereotactic re-irradiation using a cyberknife. Background: This study aimed to elucidate the influence of skin invasion in patients with recurrent head and neck cancer treated with re-irradiation using stereotactic radiotherapy. Materials: We reviewed 104 patients treated using CyberKnife in four institutions. Result(s): Nine cases of skin invasion were recognized (8.6 %). Larger tumors tended to exhibit skin invasion. The skin invasion (+) group showed a lower response rate (0/9, 0 %) than the skin invasion (-) group (56/95, 59 %) (p = 0.002). The skin invasion (+) group showed lower local control (LC) and progression free survival (PFS) rates, both 0 % at 6 months, than the skin invasion (-) group, which had a LC of 69 % (p = 0.0001) and a PFS of 48 % at 1 year (p = 0.0157). Median survival time and one-year survival rates for the skin invasion (+) and (-) groups were 6.6 vs. 15.3 months and 14 % vs. 59 % (p = 0.0005), respectively. No patient with skin invasion survived more than 14.4 months. The percentage of patients who developed grade 3 or higher toxicity was 44 % in the skin invasion (+) group and 18 % in the skin invasion (-) group (p = 0.14).

1990,"Identifying the mesenchymal molecular subtype of glioblastoma using quantitative volumetric analysis of anatomic magnetic resonance images. BackgroundSubtypes of glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) based on genetic and molecular alterations are thought to cause alterations in anatomic MRI owing to downstream biological changes, such as edema production, blood-brain barrier breakdown, and necrosis. The purpose of the current study was to identify a potential relationship between imaging features and the mesenchymal (MES) GBM subtype, which has the worst patient prognosis.MethodsMRIs from 46 patients with histologically confirmed GBM were retrospectively analyzed. The volume of contrast enhancement, regions of central necrosis, and hyperintensity of T2/fluid attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) were measured. Additionally, the ratio of T2/FLAIR hyperintense volume to the volume of contrast enhancement and necrosis was calculated.ResultsThe volume of contrast enhancement, volume of central necrosis, combined volume of contrast enhancement and central necrosis, and the ratio of T2/FLAIR to contrast enhancement and necrosis were significantly different in MES compared with non-MES GBM (Mann-Whitney, P <. 05). Receiver-operator characteristics indicated that these 4 metrics were all significant predictors of the MES phenotype. The volume ratio of T2 hyperintensity to contrast enhancement and central necrosis was significantly lower in MES vs non-MES GBM (P <. 0001), was a significant predictor of the MES phenotype (area under the curve = 0.93, P <. 001), and could be used to stratify short- and long-term overall survival (log-rank, P =. 0064 using cutoff of 3.0). These trends were also present when excluding isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 mutant tumors and incorporating covariates such as age and KPS score.ConclusionsResults suggest that volume ratio may be a simple, cost-effective, and noninvasive biomarker for quickly identifying MES GBM. © 2013 © The Author(s).",Excluded
1428,"Higher dose rate Gamma Knife radiosurgery may provide earlier and longer-lasting pain relief for patients with trigeminal neuralgia. Object Gamma Knife radiosurgery (GKRS) utilizes cobalt-60 as its radiation source, and thus dose rate varies as the fixed source decays over its half-life of approximately 5.26 years. This natural decay results in increasing treatment times when delivering the same cumulative dose. It is also possible, however, that the biological effective dose may change based on this dose rate even if the total dose is kept constant. Because patients are generally treated in a uniform manner, radiosurgery for trigeminal neuralgia (TN) represents a clinical model whereby biological efficacy can be tested. The authors hypothesized that higher dose rates would result in earlier and more complete pain relief but only if measured with a sensitive pain assessment tool. Methods One hundred thirty-three patients were treated with the Gamma Knife Model 4C unit at a single center by a single neurosurgeon during a single cobalt life cycle from January 2006 to May 2012. All patients were treated with 80 Gy with a single 4-mm isocenter without blocking. Using an output factor of 0.87, dose rates ranged from 1.28 to 2.95 Gy/min. The Brief Pain Inventory (BPI)-Facial was administered before the procedure and at the first follow-up office visit 1 month from the procedure (mean 1.3 months). Phone calls were made to evaluate patients after their procedures as part of a retrospective study. Univariate and multivariate linear regression was performed on several independent variables, including sex, age in deciles, diagnosis, follow-up duration, prior surgery, and dose rate. Results In the short-term analysis (mean 1.3 months), patients' self-reported pain intensity at its worst was significantly correlated with dose rate on multivariate analysis (p = 0.028). Similarly, patients' self-reported interference with activities of daily living was closely correlated with dose rate on multivariate analysis (p = 0.067). A 1 Gy/min decrease in dose rate resulted in a 17% decrease in pain intensity at its worst and a 22% decrease in pain interference with activities of daily living. In longer-term follow-up (mean 1.9 years), GKRS with higher dose rates (> 2.0 Gy/min; p = 0.007) and older age in deciles (p = 0.012) were associated with a lower likelihood of recurrence of pain. Discussion Prior studies investigating the role of dose rate in Gamma Knife radiosurgical ablation for TN have not used validated outcome tools to measure pain preoperatively. Consequently, differences in pain outcomes have been difficult to measure. By administering pain scales both preoperatively as well as postoperatively, the authors have identified statistically significant differences in pain intensity and pain interference with activities of daily living when comparing higher versus lower dose rates. Radiosurgery with a higher dose rate results in more pain relief at the early follow-up evaluation, and it may result in a lower recurrence rate at later follow-up.Copyright © AANS, 2015.",Excluded
3595,"Tolerance and dose-volume relationship of intrathoracic stomach irradiation after esophagectomy for patients with thoracic esophageal squamous cell carcinoma. Purpose: To identify the tolerance of radiation with a high prescribed dose and predictors for the development of intrathoracic stomach toxicity in patients with thoracic esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) after esophagectomy followed by gastric conduit reconstruction. Methods and Materials: From 2011 to 2013, 105 patients after esophagectomy were treated with postoperative radiotherapy. The intrathoracic stomach was outlined with the calculation of a dose-volume histogram (DVH) for the initial intended treatment of 6020 cGy or 6300 cGy. The volume of the intrathoracic stomach receiving each dose was recorded at 10-Gy intervals between 10 and 40 Gy and at 5-Gy intervals between 40 and 60 Gy. The grade of toxicities was defined by the National Cancer Institute Common Toxicity Criteria version 4.0. Result(s): The mean and maximum doses of the intrathoracic stomach were 2449 +/- 986 cGy and 6519 +/- 406 cGy, respectively. Sixteen (15.2%) and three (2.9%) experienced Common Toxicity Criteria Grade 2 and Grade 3 acute gastric toxicity. There were no Grade 4 toxicities. Fourteen patients (13.3%) exhibited late gastric complications possibly related to radiation. The volume percent of the intrathoracic stomach receiving at least 50 Gy (V50) was strongly associated with the degree of toxicity (p = 0.024, respectively). Multivariate analysis of patient and treatmentrelated factors revealed no other significant predictors of severe toxicities. Conclusion(s): The intrathoracic stomach is well tolerated with a high-dose irradiation for patients with esophageal SCC receiving radiotherapy after esophagectomy. A strong dose-volume relationship exists for the development of Grade 2 acute intrathoracic stomach toxicity in our study.",Excluded
143,"Radiation dose and intra-articular access: comparison of the lateral mortise and anterior midline approaches to fluoroscopically guided tibiotalar joint injections. PURPOSE: To compare the lateral mortise and anterior midline approaches to fluoroscopically guided tibiotalar joint injections with respect to successful intra-articular needle placement, fluoroscopy time, radiation dose, and dose area product (DAP)., MATERIALS AND METHODS: This retrospective study was IRB-approved and HIPAA-compliant. 498 fluoroscopically guided tibiotalar joint injections were performed or supervised by one of nine staff radiologists from 11/1/2010-12/31/2013. The injection approach was determined by operator preference. Images were reviewed on a PACS workstation to determine the injection approach (lateral mortise versus anterior midline) and to confirm intra-articular needle placement. Fluoroscopy time (minutes), radiation dose (mGy), and DAP (muGy-m(2)) were recorded and compared using the student's t-test (fluoroscopy time) or the Wilcoxon rank sum test (radiation dose and DAP)., RESULTS: There were 246 lateral mortise injections and 252 anterior midline injections. Two lateral mortise injections were excluded from further analysis because no contrast was administered. Intra-articular location of the needle tip was documented in 242/244 lateral mortise injections and 252/252 anterior midline injections. Mean fluoroscopy time was shorter for the lateral mortise group than the anterior midline group (0.7 +/- 0.5 min versus 1.2 +/- 0.8 min, P < 0.0001). Mean radiation dose and DAP were less for the lateral mortise group than the anterior midline group (2.1 +/- 3.7 mGy versus 2.5 +/- 3.5 mGy, P = 0.04; 11.5 +/- 15.3 muGy-m(2) versus 13.5 +/- 17.3 muGy-m(2), P = 0.006)., CONCLUSION: Both injection approaches resulted in nearly 100% rates of intra-articular needle placement, but the lateral mortise approach used approximately 40% less fluoroscopy time and delivered 15% lower radiation dose and DAP to the patient.",Excluded

PURPOSE: To prospectively investigate the effects of radiation dose and section thickness on quantitative multidetector computed tomographic (CT) indexes of pulmonary emphysema., MATERIALS AND METHODS: The institutional review board approved this protocol. Written informed consent was obtained from all patients. Seventy patients (49 men, 21 women; age range, 38-79 years) referred for surgical resection of a lung tumor underwent multidetector CT with 4 x 1-mm collimation, 120 kVp, and 20 and 120 effective mAs. At each radiation dose, 1.25-, 5.0-, and 10.0-mm-thick sections were reconstructed at 10-mm intervals. From scans of the lobe or whole lung to be resected, relative areas (RAs) of lung with attenuation coefficients lower than nine thresholds and eight percentiles of the distribution of attenuation coefficients were compared with the histopathologic extent of emphysema, which was measured microscopically--by using the corrected mean interwall distance (MIWD) and the corrected mean perimeter (MP)--and macroscopically. Correlations between the data obtained by using attenuation thresholds and percentiles and the parameters macroscopic extent of emphysema, MIWD, and MP were investigated by using Spearman coefficients., RESULTS: The 1st percentile (r range, -0.394 to -0.675; P < .001) and attenuation coefficients of -980, -970, and -960 HU (r range, 0.478-0.664; P < .001) yielded the strongest correlations with macroscopic extent, MIWD, and MP, regardless of radiation dose or section thickness. The effects of radiation dose and section thickness on RAs of lung with attenuation coefficients lower than -960 HU (P = .007 and P < .001, respectively) and lower than -970 HU (P = .001 and P < .001, respectively) were significant. The effect of section thickness on the 1st percentile was significant (P < .001), whereas the effect of dose was not (P = .910)., CONCLUSION: At CT quantification of pulmonary emphysema, the tube current-time product can be reduced to 20 mAs, but both tube current-time product and section thickness should be kept constant in follow-up examinations.",Excluded

PURPOSE: To identify clinical and treatment-related predictors of brachial plexus-associated neuropathies after radiation therapy for head-and-neck cancer., METHODS AND MATERIALS: Three hundred thirty patients who had previously completed radiation therapy for head-and-neck cancer were prospectively screened using a standardized instrument for symptoms of neuropathy thought to be related to brachial plexus injury. All patients were disease-free at the time of screening. The median time from completion of radiation therapy was 56 months (range, 6-135 months). One-hundred fifty-five patients (47%) were treated by definitive radiation therapy, and 175 (53%) were treated postoperatively. Radiation doses ranged from 50 to 74 Gy (median, 66 Gy). Intensity-modulated radiation therapy was used in 62% of cases, and 133 patients (40%) received concurrent chemotherapy., RESULTS: Forty patients (12%) reported neuropathic symptoms, with the most common being ipsilateral pain (50%), numbness/tingling (40%), motor weakness, and/or muscle atrophy (25%). When patients with <5 years of follow-up were excluded, the rate of positive symptoms increased to 22%. On univariate analysis, the following factors were significantly associated with brachial plexus symptoms: prior neck dissection (p = 0.01), concurrent chemotherapy (p = 0.01), and radiation maximum dose (p < 0.001). Cox regression analysis confirmed that both neck dissection (p < 0.001) and radiation maximum dose (p < 0.001) were independently predictive of symptoms., CONCLUSION: The incidence of brachial plexus-associated neuropathies after radiation therapy for head-and-neck cancer may be underreported. In view of the dose-response relationship identified, limiting radiation dose to the brachial plexus should be considered when possible. Copyright © 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.",Excluded

Purpose/Objective(s): To assess the outcomes for adult patients treated for medulloblastoma at a large academic center. Materials/Methods: Wereviewed our experience in treating adult (age.18) patientswith a diagnosis ofmedulloblastoma. Information was gathered retrospectively on 66 patients who were seen at the time of initial diagnosis at our institution from1969 to 2008. Pathology was reviewed at the time of this analysis for all patients with available slides.Median age was 33. 44 patients hadM0 disease, 9 had M1, and 13were classified asMX.31 patientswere classified as high risk, 31 as standard risk and 4 patients had incomplete information for risk stratification. Classic histology was the most common type (n = 40) followed by desmoplastic (n = 9) and large cell/ anaplastic (n = 1). Radiation information was available in 64 patients. 61 received craniospinal radiotherapy (median dose 36 Gy) and 62 received posterior fossa radiotherapy (median total dose 55 Gy). 28 patients received adjuvant chemotherapy which was most commonly cisplatin based. Overall survival (OS) and progression free survival (PFS)were estimated with Kaplan-Meier curves.Any recurrence or deathwas counted as an event in the estimation of PFS. Cox regression analysiswas used to compare recurrences between different groups (only patients that recurred were counted as having an event). The effect of chemotherapy in different groups was also assessed. Result(s):Median follow-upwas 80months. The estimated 5-yearOS and PFSwas 74%and 59%, respectively.High risk classification was associatedwithworseOS (p= 0.03) and recurrence (HR2.56, p= 0.05) and trend forworse PFS(p= 0.1313). Five-yearOSand PFS was 61% and 49% for high-risk, compared to 86% and 69% for patients classified as standard risk. Gross total resection (GTR) was associatedwith an improvement inOS (p = 0.03) and a trend toward improved PFS (p = 0.09) compared to subtotal resection or biopsy. No significant differenceswere observed for gender, location (midline vs. lateral), radiation dose, histologic type, anaplasia extent, treatment era or use ofMRI for staging.No benefit for chemotherapy could be demonstrated for the group as a whole. For high risk patients with classic histology (n= 25), chemotherapywas associatedwith animprovement in 5 year PFS from36%to 71%(p = 0.10 by log-rank and 0.05 by Wilcoxon test) and an improvement in 5 year OS from 49% to 100% (p = 0.08 by log-rank and 0.04 by Wilcoxon test). Conclusion(s): In adult patients with medulloblastoma, extent of resection and risk group are predictors of outcome. No significant difference in outcomes was observed by treatment era. These exploratory results suggest a possible benefit for chemotherapy in the group of high risk patients with classic histology.",Excluded
1455,"Adjuvant radiotherapy for margin-positive high-grade soft tissue sarcoma of the extremity. Purpose: Adjuvant radiotherapy (RT) has been shown to improve local control in patients with soft tissue sarcoma of the extremities (STS). The specific impact of adjuvant radiation on patients with positive margins, however, has not been clearly defined. The purpose of this study was to determine if adjuvant RT improves local control in patients with high-grade STS who had positive margins of resection. Methods and Materials: Between 8/82 and 2/97, 110 adult patients with primary high-grade STS of an extremity underwent limb sparing surgery and were found to have a histologically positive microscopic surgical margin. Ninety-one (83%) received RT and 19 (17%) had no RT. The two groups were balanced with regard to size, site, location, and tumor depth. Adjuvant RT was delivered with brachytherapy (BRT) alone in 34 patients, external beam radiotherapy (EBRT) alone in 33 patients, or BRT+EBRT in 24 patients. The BRT dose was 45 Gy when used alone and 15-20 Gy when used as a boost. The EBRT dose was 60-70 Gy when used alone and 45-50 Gy when given with BRT. The median follow-up time was 41 months (range, 3-186 months). Result(s): The overall 5 year local control rate was 71%. This rate was significantly higher in the RT group compared to the no RT group (74% vs. 56%, respectively) (p = 0.01). On univariate analysis, lower extremity site and proximal location were also found to be predictors of improved local control (p = 0.03 and 0.03, respectively). However, only proximal location and the use of RT retained their significance as predictors of improved local control on multivariate analysis (p = 0.003 and 0.01, respectively). The overall 5-year distant relapse-free survival, disease-free survival, and overall survival rates were 54%, 44%, and 53%, respectively. No statistical differences were found in these survival rates between RT and no RT groups. Conclusion(s): Based on this study, adjuvant radiotherapy seems to improve local control in patients with high-grade STS of the extremity with positive margins. However, local recurrence still occurs in a substantial proportion of patients, mandating further need for improvement. Copyright (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Inc.",Excluded
1342,"Salvage gamma knife stereotactic radiosurgery followed by bevacizumab for recurrent glioblastoma multiforme: a case-control study. We evaluated the efficacy and safety of gamma knife stereotactic radiosurgery (GKSR) followed by bevacizumab combined with chemotherapy in 11 patients with recurrent glioblastoma multiforme who experienced tumor progression despite aggressive initial multi-modality treatment. Our experience included eight male and three female patients. The median patient age at GKSR was 62 years (range 46-72 years). At the time of GKSR, seven patients had a first recurrence and four had two or more recurrences. The median interval from the initial diagnosis until GKSR was 17 months (range 5-34.5 months). The median tumor volume was 13.6 cm(3) (range 1.2-45.1 cm(3)) and the median margin dose of GKSR was 16 Gy (range 13-18 Gy). Following GKSR, bevacizumab was administrated with irinotecan in nine patients and with temozolomide in one patient. One patient was treated with bevacizumab monotherapy. The treatment outcomes were compared to 44 case-matched controls who underwent GKSR without additional bevacizumab. At a median of 13.7 months (range 4.6-28.3 months) after radiosurgery, tumor progression was evident in seven patients. The median progression-free survival (PFS) was 15 months (95% confidential interval (CI), 6.5-23.3 months). Six-month and 1-year PFS rates were 73 and 55%, respectively. The median overall survival (OS) from GKSR was 18 months (95% CI, 10.1-25.7 months) and 1-year OS rate was 73%. One patient (9%) experienced grade III toxicity and one patient (9%) had major adverse radiation effects. Compared with patients who did not receive bevacizumab, the patients who received bevacizumab had significantly prolonged PFS (15 months vs. 7 months, P = 0.035) and OS (18 months vs. 12 months, P = 0.005), and were less likely to develop an adverse radiation effect (9 vs. 46%, P = 0.037). The combination of salvage GKSR followed by bevacizumab added potential benefit and little additional risk in a small group of patients with progressive glioblastoma.

The crucial question, however, is to explore which parameter is suited best to describe the differences between patients with increased radiosensitivity and healthy individuals., PATIENTS AND METHODS: In this study, five patients with severe radiation-induced late effects of at least grade 3, classified according to the Radiation Therapy Oncology Group (RTOG), and eleven healthy individuals were examined retrospectively. Peripheral blood lymphocytes were irradiated in vitro with 0.7 Gy and 2.0 Gy prior to cultivation and stained by means of three-color fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH). The detailed analysis was focused on the number of breaks per metaphase, on breaks from complex chromosomal rearrangements per metaphase, as well as on the percentage of translocations, dicentric chromosomes, breaks, and excess acentric fragments-each in comparison with the total number of mitoses analyzed., RESULTS: Using the number of breaks from complex chromosomal rearrangements after 2.0 Gy, radiosensitive patients as endpoint were clearly to be distinguished (p = 0.001) from healthy individuals. Translocations (p = 0.001) as well as breaks per metaphase (p = 0.002) were also suitable indicators for detecting differences between patients and healthy individuals. The parameters ""percentage of dicentric chromosomes"", ""breaks"", and ""excess acentric fragments"" in comparison to the total number of mitoses analyzed could neither serve as meaningful nor as significant criteria, since they showed a strong interindividual variability., CONCLUSION: To detect a difference in chromosomal aberrations between healthy and radiosensitive individuals, the parameters ""frequency of breaks per metaphase"", ""complex chromosomal rearrangements"", and ""translocations"" are most suitable.",Excluded

2195,"Concurrent chemoradiotherapy with docetaxel, cisplatin, and 5-fluorouracil improves survival of patients with advanced esophageal cancer compared with conventional concurrent chemoradiotherapy with cisplatin and 5-fluorouracil. Purpose: To compare treatment outcomes and adverse events between concurrent chemoradiotherapy with docetaxel, cisplatin, and 5-fluorouracil (DCF-RT) and conventional concurrent chemoradiotherapy with cisplatin and 5-fluorouracil (CF-RT). Methods and Materials: We retrospectively investigated treatment outcomes and adverse events in 121 patients with advanced esophageal cancer who underwent concurrent chemoradiotherapy with CF-RT (n = 83) or DCF-RT (n = 38). In the CF-RT group, patients were administered cisplatin (70 mg/m2) and 5-fluorouracil (700 mg/m2) for 5 days; in the DCF-RT group, patients were administered docetaxel (50 mg/m2), cisplatin (50 mg/m2), and 5-fluorouracil (500 mg/m2) for 5 days. The radiotherapy dose was 1.8-2 Gy per session, up to a total of 50-60 Gy. Result(s): The complete response (CR) rate was 37.8% in the CF-RT group and 52.6% in the DCF-RT group. Overall survival (OS) rates at 2 and 3 years were 45.0% and 37.5%, respectively, in the CF-RT group and 62.9% and 56.7%, respectively, in the DCF-RT group, with a significant intergroup difference (p = 0.032). Progression-free survival rates at 2 and 3 years were 44.1% and 36.9%, respectively, in the CF-RT group and 45.0% and 45.0%, respectively, in the DCF-RT group (p = 0.10). Local control rates at 2 and 3 years were 59.1% and 54.6%, respectively, in the CF-RT group and 71.8% and 71.8%, respectively, in the DCF-RT group (p = 0.12). The incidence of Grade 3/4 leukopenia was 55.4% (n = 46) in the CF-RT group and 78.9% (n = 30) in the DCF-RT group, with a significant intergroup difference (p = 0.022). The incidence of Grade 3/4 neutropenia was 47.0% (n = 39) in the CF-RT group and 65.8% (n = 25) in the DCF-RT group, with a notable albeit not statistically significant difference between the groups (p = 0.054). There were no significant intergroup differences in anemia, thrombocytopenia, radiation-induced dermatitis, radiation esophagitis, or late adverse events. Conclusion(s): Rates of OS and CR were improved after treatment with DCF-RT compared with CF-RT. Although DCF-RT-treated patients had higher rates of leukopenia, treatment safety was ensured through proper management of myelotoxicity. DCF-RT is a promising treatment regimen for advanced esophageal cancer.Copyright © Ivyspring International Publisher.",Excluded
419,Efficacy of radiation therapy for the treatment of macroscopic canine oral soft tissue sarcoma. This retrospective study evaluated the efficacy of radiotherapy used alone in macroscopic oral soft tissue sarcoma. Thirty-one dogs qualified for the study. Twenty dogs received curative radiotherapy (median total dose: 52.5 Gy) and eleven dogs were treated palliatively (3 x 8 Gy or 5 x 6 Gy). The time-to-progression for the curatively-treated dogs was 333 days versus 180 days for the palliatively-treated dogs (p=0.134). The overall survival was 331 days for the curative group and 310 days for the palliative group (p =0.2292).

Objective: To assess the clinical efficacy and share the technique notes of Wiltse Approach TLIF for the treating single segment degenerative lumbar spinal disease. Method(s): In this retrospective controlled study, 780 patients with single segment degenerative lumbar disease who were operated in our hospital from January 2016 to December 2020 were analyzed retrospectively. The patients were randomly assigned to Wiltse approach group (group A, 410 cases) and conventional open approach group (group B, 370 cases). Patient's assessment of pain and disability were evaluated by the visual analogue scale (VAS) and the Oswestry disability index (ODI) before and after surgery. The incision length, operative time, exposure time, intraoperative blood loss, hidden blood loss, time to ambulation, total length of hospitalization, serum creatine kinase, X-rays, CT and MRI were also evaluated. Result(s): There were no differences in sex, age, pre-operative ODI score, VAS score between the two groups (P > 0.05). The Wiltse approach group had a shorter incision length with 7.69 +/- 0.44 cm compared to the conventional group with 11.13 +/- 0.36 cm (P < 0.01). The average operative time was 119.20 +/- 14.64 min with exposure time of 16.20 +/- 3.42 min in the Wiltse approach group and 145.65 +/- 16.98 min with 29.20 +/- 3.42 min in the conventional group (P < 0.05, P < 0.01). Comparing the intraoperative blood loss, hidden blood loss, serum creatine kinase, time to ambulation, total length of hospitalization, the Wiltse approach group was less than the conventional open approach group (P < 0.05). The VAS score of the two groups decreased significantly with time, and the VAS score of the Wiltse group was significantly lower than that of the conventional open approach group (P < 0.05). At last investigation after operation, ODI scores of the two groups were significantly decreased compared with that before operation. Wiltse approach group was significantly lower than that of the conventional open approach group (P < 0.05). The multifidus of the two groups of patients had a certain degree of atrophy. But the Wiltse approach group multifidus muscle atrophy rate is significantly lower than the conventional open approach group. Conclusion(s): The Wiltse approach TLIF significantly reduces the damage to the paravertebral muscles and the postoperative incidence of chronic low back pain.Copyright © 2021 The Authors.

775,"Removal of Antiscatter Grids for Spinal Digital Subtraction Angiography: Dose Reduction without Loss of Diagnostic Value. Background Spinal digital subtraction angiography (DSA) exposes patients and operators to substantial amounts of radiation. Antiscatter grid (ASG) removal is used to decrease radiation exposure but may reduce image quality. Purpose To determine whether ASG removal during spinal DSA in adults reduces radiation dose while maintaining diagnostic image quality and whether dose reduction is related to body mass index (BMI). Materials and Methods This Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act-compliant prospective study included adults undergoing spinal DSA between January and December 2016. Each procedure included an additional angiographic acquisition performed twice, once with and once without ASG, either documenting the artery of Adamkiewicz (no pathology group) or the condition leading to the procedure (pathology group). Dose differences between study acquisitions and the influence of BMI were evaluated via paired t test. Two neurointerventionalists blinded to acquisition protocols were asked to independently evaluate a sample of 40 study acquisitions (20 with ASG, 20 without ASG) from 20 randomly selected participants to (a) rate image quality, (b) categorize findings, and (c) determine whether images had been obtained with or without ASG. Percentage agreement on image quality, findings categorization, and ability to correctly identify the acquisition protocol was calculated for both readers. Results Fifty-three participants (mean age +/- standard deviation, 51 years +/- 15.2; 32 men) were evaluated. ASG removal reduced the mean dose per acquisition by approximately 33% (mean dose-area product and air kerma decreased from 202 to 135.6 microGy/m2 and from 35.3 to 24 mGy, respectively; P < .001) independently of BMI (P = .3). Both readers evaluated all images (40 of 40) as being of diagnostic quality and correctly categorized findings in 19 of 20 (95%) cases. Overall percentage agreement for correct protocol identification was 60% (12 of 20) for grid-in and 45% (nine of 20) for grid-out images.

Investigate whether percutaneous spinal cord stimulator (SCS) leads migrate significantly during a 3-day trial, and determine whether the skin anchoring method influences lead migration. Material and Methods. Twenty patients were prospectively enrolled. Ten leads were anchored with suture and tape and 10 were anchored with tape only. A standardized X-ray protocol of lead position was obtained immediately following lead placement and upon completion of the trial. Results. Using a standardized method, SCS leads were measured and movement was calculated. The average movement for leads anchored with tape only was 8.72mm (SD=5.77), inferiorly; while movement for leads anchored with suture and tape was 24.49mm (SD=11.3), inferiorly. A t-test revealed a significant difference between the groups (t=3.9, P=0.001). Conclusions. Percutaneous SCS trial electrodes migrate significantly, inferiorly, during a 3-day trial. Anchoring the trial electrodes to the skin with a suture and tape results in significantly greater inferior migration when compared with anchoring the lead with tape only.

729,"Use of neuronavigated transcranial magnetic stimulation and diffusion tensor imaging to avoid motor cortex complications in robotic stereotactic radiation therapy planning. Purpose/Objective(s): The purpose of this preliminary study was to find out if motor cortex and the motor tract can be avoided in robotic stereotactic radiation therapy/radiosurgery (RT/SRS) planning by using individually made maps from these areas. Materials/Methods: Before radiation therapy planning, the motor cortex was mapped from 2 meningioma patients using neuronavigated transcranial magnetic stimulation (nTMS) combined with a neuronavigation system. In addition, the descending motor pathways were determined with diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) tractography. Planning CT and MRI scans were also taken. Images were registered in treatment planning software by using a mutual image information algorithm and, in the case of nTMS, map manual registration via external markers. Two RT plans were made both with and without using the motor cortex and descending motor pathways as organs at risk (OARs). Dosimetric analysis was conducted comparing these plans with a focus on target coverage and motor cortex sparing. Result(s): Individual anatomical information from the motor cortex and motor pathways were imported into the RT planning system. Dosimetric analysis is described in Table 1. (Table Presented) Conclusion(s): For the 2 patients, the motor cortex and descending motor pathways were mapped before robotic stereotactic RT for meningioma. These are both noninvasive procedures and easy for the patients. The new OARs were able to be spared without compromising target irradiation. Sparing of the motor cortex and descending motor pathways was noticeable in their 0.01 mL maximum doses, being respectively 11.4% and 6.3% for patient 1 and 54.4% and 16.1% for patient 2. There were no differences in mean values, due the large volume of these OAR structures and the high dose gradients of the robotic stereotactic RT. Target coverage and mean dose were not affected by sparing of the motor cortex with either patient. With using this individual functional information to avoid motor cortex areas in RT planning we were able to spare selected patients from possible adverse effects without compromising target dose coverage. As the study is in a preliminary stage, in the future, motor area information will be mapped from more intracranial RT patients, and this information will be used to spare the motor area better than has thus far been possible. The potential RT-induced aftereffects will be studied during a follow-up period.",Excluded
2473,"Volume of high-dose regions and likelihood of locoregional control after perioperative high-dose-rate brachytherapy: do hotter implants work better?. PURPOSE: To determine whether perioperative high-dose-rate brachytherapy (PHDRB) implants with larger high-dose regions produce increased locoregional control., METHODS AND MATERIALS: Patients (n=166) enrolled in several PHDRB prospective studies conducted at the University of Navarre were analyzed. The PHDRB was given to total doses of 16Gy/4 b.i.d. or 24Gy/6 b.i.d. treatments for negative or close/positive margins along with 45Gy/25 Rx of external beam radiation therapy. The histogram-based generalized equivalent uniform dose (EUD) formulism was used to quantify and standardize the dose-volume histogram into 2-Gy equivalents. The region of interest analyzed included: tissue volume encompassed by the prescription isodose of 4Gy (TV100). Routine dose reporting parameters such as physical dose and single-point 2-Gy equivalent dose were used for reference., RESULTS: After a median followup of 7.4 years (range, 3-12+), 50 patients have failed, and 116 remain controlled at last followup. Overall, EUD was not different in the patients who failed compared with controls (89.1Gy vs. 86.5Gy; p=not significant). When patients were stratified by risk using the University of Navarre Predictive Model, very high-risk patients (i.e., tumors >=3cm resected with close <1mm/positive margins) had an improved locoregional control with higher EUD values (p=0.028). This effect was not observed in low-, intermediate-, and high-risk University of Navarre Predictive Model categories., CONCLUSIONS: In very high-risk patients, enlarged high-dose regions can produce a dose-response effect. Routine dose reporting methods such as physical dose and single-point 2-Gy equivalent dose may not show this effect, but it can be revealed by histogram-based EUD assessment.

1796,"Cardiac exposure in the dynamic conformal arc therapy, intensity-modulated radiotherapy and volumetric modulated arc therapy of lung cancer. Purpose: To retrospectively evaluate the cardiac exposure in three cohorts of lung cancer patients treated with dynamic conformal arc therapy (DCAT), intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT), or volumetricmodulated arc therapy (VMAT) at our institution in the past seven years. Methods and Materials: A total of 140 lung cancer patients were included in this institutional review board approved study: 25 treated with DCAT, 70 with IMRT and 45 with VMAT. All plans were generated in a same commercial treatment planning system and have been clinically accepted and delivered. The dose distribution to the heart and the effects of tumor laterality, the irradiated heart volume and the beam-to-heart distance on the cardiac exposure were investigated. Result(s): The mean dose to the heart among all 140 plans was 4.5 Gy. Specifically, the heart received on average 2.3, 5.2 and 4.6 Gy in the DCAT, IMRT and VMAT plans, respectively. The mean heart doses for the left and right lung tumors were 4.1 and 4.8 Gy, respectively. No patients died with evidence of cardiac disease. Three patients (2%) with preexisting cardiac condition developed cardiac disease after treatment. Furthermore, the cardiac exposure was found to increase linearly with the irradiated heart volume while decreasing exponentially with the beam-to-heart distance. Conclusion(s): Compared to old technologies for lung cancer treatment, modern radiotherapy treatment modalities demonstrated better heart sparing. But the heart dose in lung cancer radiotherapy is still higher than that in the radiotherapy of breast cancer and Hodgkin's disease where cardiac complications have been extensively studied. With strong correlations of mean heart dose with beam-to-heart distance and irradiated heart volume, cautions should be exercised to avoid long-term cardiac toxicity in the lung cancer patients undergoing radiotherapy.Copyright © 2015 Ming et al.

Purpose: To evaluate the efficacy and toxicity of high-dose-rate (HDR) brachytherapy in patients with inoperable endobronchial carcinoma. Methods and Materials: We retrospectively reviewed the records (April 1991 - May 2004) of patients with non-small-cell carcinoma, with no extrabronchial spread on computed tomography scans, who underwent HDR brachytherapy because of contraindications to surgery and external beam radiation therapy. Kaplan-Meier survival curves were compared by the log-rank test. Prognostic factors were analyzed by multivariate analysis. Result(s): 226 patients (223 men, 3 women, mean age: 62.2 years (range, 40-84)) were included. Of those, 217 (97%) had squamous cell carcinoma (Tis/T1/T2/Tx: 60/153/9/4). Dose was prescribed at 1 cm from the radius (24-35 Gy in 4-6 fractions). Mean follow-up was 30.4 months (range, 9-116). Complete endoscopic response rate was 93.6% at 3 months. One hundred twenty-eight patients (56%) died of intercurrent disease (n = 45), local failure (n = 36), metastasis (n = 10), local failure and metastasis (n = 11), complications (n = 13), and other causes (n = 12). The 2-year and 5-year survival rates were, respectively, 57% and 29% (overall) (median, 28.6 months), 81% and 56% (cancer-specific), and 68% and 50% (local disease-free). Acute toxicity included pneumothorax (1.5%) and mucosal inflammation (10%). Late complications were hemoptysis (6.6% with 5% of fatalities), bronchitis (19.5%), and necrosis (3.5%). In multivariate analysis, a distal tumor location and the use of two catheters were associated with improved local disease-free survival (p = 0.003 and p = 0.007, respectively) and a distal tumor location with improved overall survival (p = 0.0001).

Purpose: To estimate the dose response relationship for submandibular gland (SMG) recovery using salivary scintigraphy in patients diagnosed with head and neck cancer treated with curative image guided chemoradiation. Material(s) and Method(s): Ninety newly diagnosed head and neck cancer patients (T1-3, N0-2c, M0) treated with intensity modulated radiotherapy on a prospective clinical trial were assessed for salivary toxicity at predefined intervals using dynamic salivary scintigraphy. The SMG function was measured using salivary excretion fraction (SEF) ratios at baseline and 6 monthly. Tolerance dose (TD) 50 for submandibular gland was estimated from dose response curves. Result(s): The mean SEF ratio of 180 SMGs decreased at 6 months with a nadir at 12 months after treatment (SEF ratio 15%) and progressively recovered over time reaching 38% over 24 months. There was significant inverse correlation between SEF ratio and mean SMG dose at 6 months (r = -0.18, p = 0.04); 12-months (r = -0.36, p < 0.001); 18-months (r = -0.48, p < 0.001); 24-months (r = -0.42, p < 0.001); and more than 24-months (r = -0.56, p < 0.001). The estimated TD 50 values at 1 year and 2 year post treatment were 36 Gy and 44 Gy respectively with SEF ratio of <=45% used to define severe xerostomia. For every 1 Gy reduction in mean dose below 54 Gy, there is 2-2.5% reduction in the probability of severe xerostomia. Conclusion(s): The submandibular gland function declines after radiotherapy with a nadir at 12 months and there is incomplete recovery over time with continued improvement over 24 months. The TD 50 at 1 year and 2 year was 36 Gy and 44 Gy with a 2-2.5% reduction in the probability of severe xerostomia for every 1 Gy reduction in mean dose.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier B.V.",Excluded

Qualitative image parameters of overall image quality, reader confidence, and image artifacts showed nonsignificant differences among the four groups (p >= 0.162)., CONCLUSIONS: Third-generation DSCT systems show lower radiation dose parameters for CTPA compared to second-generation DSCT. DECT can be performed with both scanner generations without radiation dose penalty or detrimental effects on image quality compared to SECT., KEY POINTS: * Radiation exposure showed nonsignificant differences between SECT and DECT for both DSCT scanner devices. * Dual-energy CTPA provides equivalent image quality compared to standard image acquisition. * Subjective image quality assessment was similar among the four study groups.",Excluded
2624,"Assessment of intraocular foreign bodies by helical-CT multiplanar imaging. The aim of this study was to examine the effectiveness of helical CT in the assessment of intraocular foreign bodies, evaluating two protocols with different collimation. We performed helical-CT studies in 30 patients. Fifteen patients were examined with 1.5-mm collimation and the other 15 patients with 3.0-mm collimation. All other imaging parameters were identical in both protocols. Multiplanar images were reconstructed. The examinations were reviewed for presence, localization and size of intraocular foreign bodies. We compare our results with the surgical data. We estimate the required examination time. In the first group (collimation 1.5 mm) an intraorbital foreign body was detected in 8 of 15 patients. In 3 of 8 patients an intraocular foreign body (all were metallic) was detected. In the second group (collimation 3.0 mm) an intraorbital foreign body was detected in 9 of 15 patients. In 8 of 9 patients an intraocular foreign body (all were metallic) was detected. Our results were confirmed by surgery in all cases. Examination time was 36 s in the first group and 18 s in the second group. Computed tomography should be considered the imaging modality of choice in the assessment of metallic intraocular foreign bodies and 3.0-mm collimation is optional, because of reduced examination time and radiation exposure.",Excluded
347,"Dynamic 4D-CT angiography for guiding transarterial chemoembolization: Impact on the reduction of contrast material, operator radiation exposure, catheter consumption, and diagnostic confidence. Purpose: This study was carried out to investigate the impact of abdominal dynamic four-dimensional CT angiography (4D-CTA) for guiding transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) on the amount of contrast material used, operator radiation exposure, catheter consumption, and diagnostic confidence. Material(s) and Method(s): Written consent was waived for this IRB-approved retrospective study. 29 patients (20 men; mean age: 65.7 +/- 11.5 years) with malignant liver lesions underwent 4D-CTA, prior to initial TACE. Time-resolved volume-rendering technique (VRT), maximum-intensity projection (MIP), and multiplanar reconstruction (MPR) series were reconstructed, enabling a direct selective catheterization of the tumorsupplying artery without prior conventional digital subtraction angiography (DSA). 29 patients (16 men; mean age: 69.4 +/- 13.9) who underwent traditional TACE served as the control group. The amount of administered contrast media, operator radiation exposure, and catheter consumption during TACE were compared. Two radiologists assessed diagnostic confidence in the exclusion of portal vein thrombosis. Results 4D-CTA TACE resulted in a significant reduction in the amount of contrast media used, compared to traditional TACE (-61.0ml/ -66.3 % intra-arterial, -12.8ml/ -13.8 % overall; P < 0.001). The dose-area product indicating operator radiation exposure during intervention was reduced by 50.5 % (P < 0.001), and 0.7 fewer catheters on average were used (P = 0.063), while 4D-CTA data was available to guide TACE. Diagnostic confidence in the exclusion of portal vein thrombosis was significantly enhanced by 4D-CTA, compared to traditional DSA images (scores, 3.9 and 2.4, respectively; P < 0.001). Conclusion(s): Dynamic 4D-CTA enables TACE with a substantially reduced amount of contrast material, decreases operator radiation exposure, and increases diagnostic confidence in the exclusion of portal vein thrombosis.Copyright © 2018 Georg Thieme Verlag KG, Stuttgart.",Excluded
1484,"Randomized phase II trial of non-platinum induction or consolidation chemotherapy plus concomitant chemoradiation in stage III NSCLC patients: Mature results of the Spanish Lung Cancer Group 0008 study. The optimal schedule and regimen of chemotherapy (CT) in association with chemoradiation has not been established in stage III non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). We have compared three schedules of non-platinum-based CT plus either radiotherapy or chemoradiation. From May 2001 to June 2006, 158 patients with unresectable stage III NSCLC were enrolled in a randomized phase II trial with overall response rate (ORR) as the primary endpoint. The initial design included three arms: sequential CT followed by thoracic radiation (TRT); concurrent CT/TRT followed by consolidation CT; and induction CT followed by concurrent CT/TRT. However, based on the preliminary results of the RTOG 9410 trial, the sequential arm was closed when 19 patients had been enrolled. All patients received two cycles of docetaxel 40mg/m2 days 1 and 8 plus gemcitabine 1200mg/m2 days 1 and 8, as either induction or consolidation therapy. Concurrent CT/TRT consisted of docetaxel 20mg/m2 and carboplatin AUC 2 weekly plus 60Gy TRT. No differences were found in ORR between the two arms (56% and 57%). Hematological toxicity was mild but significantly superior with consolidation CT; the esophagitis rate was similar in both arms (16% and 15%). With a median follow-up of 57 months, no differences were found in median survival (13.07 and 13.8 months) or 5-year survival (16.4% and 22%).

2485,"Thoracic radiotherapy with or without daily low-dose carboplatin in elderly patients with non-small-cell lung cancer: A randomised, controlled, phase 3 trial by the Japan Clinical Oncology Group (JCOG0301). Background: It is unknown whether combined chemoradiotherapy improves overall survival in elderly patients with locally advanced non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). The aim of this study was to assess whether radiotherapy plus carboplatin results in longer survival than radiotherapy alone in elderly patients with NSCLC. Method(s): This was a randomised, controlled, phase 3 trial by the Japan Clinical Oncology Group (JCOG0301). Patients older than 70 years with unresectable stage III NSCLC were randomly assigned to chemoradiotherapy (60 Gy plus concurrent low-dose carboplatin [30 mg/m2 per day, 5 days a week for 20 days]) or radiotherapy alone, using a minimisation method with biased-coin assignment balancing on Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status (0 vs 1 vs 2), stage (IIIA vs IIIB), and institution. The primary endpoint was overall survival, which was analysed for the eligible population and stratified by ECOG performance status, stage, and institution. The trial was stopped early as a result of the second planned interim analysis. This study is registered with UMIN Clinical Trials Registry, number C000000060, and ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00132665. Finding(s): 200 patients were enrolled from Sept 1, 2003 to May 27, 2010: 100 in the chemoradiotherapy group and 100 in the radiotherapy group. The second planned interim analysis was done 10 months after completion of patient accrual. At this time, median follow-up for censored cases was 19.4 months (IQR 10.3-33.5). In accordance with the prespecified stopping rule, the JCOG data and safety monitoring committee recommended early publication of this trial because the difference in overall survival favoured the chemoradiotherapy group. Median overall survival for the chemoradiotherapy and radiotherapy alone groups were 22.4 months (95% CI 16.5-33.6) and 16.9 months (13.4-20.3), respectively (hazard ratio 0.68, 95.4% CI 0.47-0.98, stratified log-rank test one-sided p value=0.0179). More patients had grade 3-4 haematological toxic effects in the chemoradiotherapy group than in the radiotherapy alone group, including leucopenia (61 [63.5%] vs none), neutropenia (55 [57.3%] vs none), and thrombocytopenia (28 [29.2%] vs two [2.0%]). Grade 3 infection was more common with chemoradiotherapy (12 patients [12.5%]) than with radiotherapy (four patients [4.1%]). Incidences of grade 3-4 pneumonitis and late lung toxicity were similar between groups. There were seven treatment-related deaths: three of 100 patients (3.0%) in the chemoradiotherapy group and four of 100 (4.0%) in the radiotherapy group. Interpretation(s): For a select group of elderly patients with locally advanced NSCLC, combination chemoradiotherapy provides a clinically significant benefit over radiotherapy alone, and should be considered for this population.

758,"Image quality and radiation exposure of coronary CT angiography in patients after coronary artery bypass graft surgery: Influence of imaging direction with 64-slice dual-source CT. Background: The evaluation of native coronary arteries (NCAs) as well as coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) patency after surgery is essential. However, NCAs are often blurred in the craniocaudal scan direction because of long scan time with 64-slice CT. Objective(s): The purpose of the study was to determine the effect of scan direction on image quality and radiation exposure in assessment of NCAs and CABGs. Method(s): Retrospective analysis of 191 consecutive individuals undergoing coronary CT angiography to evaluate CABG patency using 64-slice dual source CT. A retrospectively ECG gated spiral acquisition protocol with ECG based tube current modulation and automatic adjustment of tube current to a reference of 320 mAs (""CareDose 4D"") was used. Tube current was 120 kVp. Scan direction was either cranio-caudal (CRC, n = 98) or caudo-cranial (CRC, n = 93) and the scan volume covered the entire course of all bypass grafts. Independent investigators determined quantitative image quality of the coronary arteries by evaluating contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR), radiation exposure by comparing the effective dose, and qualitative image quality through a 5 point rating scale. Result(s): Quantitative image quality was not significantly different for the two groups except for the CNR of the right coronary artery which was significantly higher in patients with caudio-cranial scan direction (P= .0007). The qualitative image quality of the CaC group also was better for both NCAs and CABGs (P= .002 for NCAs and <.001 for CABGs), mostly because of the lower frequency of respiration artifacts on coronary arteries of the CaC group (P= .005). As an effect of automatic tube current adjustment, radiation dose was lower in patients with caudo-cranial scan direction (6.8 mSv vs. 9.6 mSv, p < 0.0001). Conclusion(s): In patients with coronary bypass grafts imaged by 64-slice dual source CT with spiral acquisition and automated tube current adjustment, a caudo-cranial scan direction results in improved image quality and reduced radiation exposure. © 2014 Society of Cardiovascular Computed Tomography.",Excluded
1032,"Enhancement of synaptic strength in the somatosensory cortex following nerve injury does not parallel behavioural alterations. Following infraorbital nerve transection, underlying mechanisms of the altered synaptic strength were studied in rat barrel cortex slice experiments. In addition to the in vitro electrophysiological studies, open-field tests were run to detect possible behavioural changes associated with cortical oversensitization. Enhanced NMDA receptor-mediated component of the evoked field response appeared in the barrel cortex after nerve injury. The alteration was transient, very distinct on the first day following injury, and almost returned to normal level by the end of the second week. Behavioural changes had not followed this time-course since long-lasting alterations were detected in the open-field test. These observations are in agreement with findings that showed biphasic regenerative processes following nerve injuries in other cortical areas.",Excluded
1461,"Effect of cranial irradiation on hypothalamus and pituitary functions. Hypopituitarism can occur after cranial irradiation for tumors distant from the pituitary gland. Recent studies have suggested that this is hypothalamic in origin. Hypothalamic and pituitary functions were studied in 11 patients, 4 men and 7 women, 4.5 years or more after radiotherapy for nasopharyngeal carcinomas. The estimated average total dose was 5000 cGys for the hypothalamus and pituitary gland. Except for 2 women with amenorrhea and 4 men with impotency, the patients did not have evident endocrine deficiency. Baseline hormone profiles revealed normal T4, T3 and cortisol levels, 6 with elevated prolactin, 3 with reduced testosterone and 3 with slightly elevated basal TSH. The four menopausal women had impaired gonadotropin response to LHRH (100 micrograms, i.v.). Four (1 menstruating, 1 amenorrheic, 2 menopausal) women did not reach peak FSH response 4 hours after LHRH injection. The other amenorrheic woman had minimal FSH and LH response to LHRH which persisted even after 8 days of pulsatile infusion of LHRH (1 microgram/90min). TSH response to TRH (400 micrograms, i.v.) was delayed in 7 patients. GH response to human GRH (1 microgram/kg, i.v.) was impaired in 6 patients (maximal GH less than 5 mU/l). ACTH response to ovine CRH (1 microgram/kg, i.v.) was impaired in 3 patients (less than 50% elevation from baseline). Three patients who had normal GRH tests had impaired GH response to insulin hypoglycemia. Six patients had an empty sella on CT scan. From this study the following conclusions are drawn: (1) Among the four axes, GH is the most vulnerable. (2) The insulin tolerance test is still the best single test for evaluation of hypothalamic function.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",Excluded
141,"Application of interstitial brachytherapy via parapharynx involvement transnasal approach to enhance dose in radiotherapy for nasopharyngeal carcinoma. BACKGROUND & OBJECTIVE: Although intracavitary irradiation (ICI) is usually applied to enhance dose in radiotherapy for early stage nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC), its use in parapharyngeal enhancing dose is limited because of dislocation and poor repetition of conventional catheterization. This study was to evaluate the application of a new technique, interstitial brachytherapy via parapharynx involvement transnasal approach, to enhance dose in radiotherapy for NPC. METHOD(S): Twenty-three naive and recurrent NPC patients with tumor residue of more than 1 cm under nasopharyngeal mucosa or restricted tumor residue in the parapharyngeal space received interstitial brachytherapy between Sep. 2005 and Aug. 2006 via parapharynx involvement transnasal approach under the guidance of sinus endoscopy. The 3-dimensional (3D) planning system was used to delineate target volume, optimize dose distribution, and perform interstitial brachytherapy after CT scan. The depths of catheters under mucosa on the moment of inserting and pulling out were measured. The efficacy and complications were assessed. RESULT(S): All catheters were intubated into tumors successfully; the veracity of catheter location was 100%. The submucosa depths of catheters were (9.59+/-2.72) mm when inserted and (9.43+/-2.30) mm when pulled out, without significant difference (t = 0.23,P > 0.05); the shift length was (0.75+/-0.75) mm. The patients were followed up from 3 to 15 months (median, 6 months), and no one dropt out. Three cases of irradiation-associated turbinate adhesion occurred and were cured after lysis; no infection, serious bleeding, palatal perforation, nasopharyngeal necrosis, and other serious complications occurred. All tumors disappeared in 3 months after treatment. No local recurrence and distant metastasis occurred. CONCLUSION(S): The nasopharyngeal and parapharyngeal catheterization with sinus endoscopy guidance is accurate, steady, safe, and feasible. Interstitial brachytherapy is effective for tumor residue in the nasopharynx or parapharyngeal space of NPC patients after radiotherapy without serious complications.",Excluded
1060,"Comparison of Middle and Lower Calyceal Access for Renal Pelvis Stone in Percutaneous Nephrolithotomy: A Prospective Randomized Study. Objective: The aim of the study was to evaluate the possible effects of calyceal choice for renal puncture under sonographic guidance on the outcomes of percutaneous nephrolithotomy (PNL). Material(s) and Method(s): A total of 70 patients for whom ultrasound-guided PNL was planned for 20-30-mm single renal pelvic stones were prospectively allocated to group 1 (n:35) with middle calyx entry or group 2 (n:35) with lower calyx entry. Procedure-related parameters such as duration of operation, stone-free rates, complication rates, and radiation exposure time were analyzed in detail. Result(s): The mean age of the patients was 45.67 +/- 1.50 years and the mean stone size was 316.4 +/- 17.95 mm2. There was no significant difference regarding the age, BMI, stone burden, and the grade of hydronephrosis between the groups. Skin to collecting system distance was significantly shorter in the middle calyx entrance (p = 0.021). Total duration of the procedure was again significantly shorter in group 1 cases (74.69 +/- 2.94 min) than in group 2 (84.29 +/- 4.25 min) (p = 0.003). Regarding the success rates, the postoperative stone-free rate was higher in group 1 (91.4% in group 1, 80.0% in group 2, p = 0.305). Last, there was no statistically significant difference in hemoglobin reduction rates, blood transfusion requirements, and complication rates between the 2 groups. Conclusion(s): Getting access to the renal pelvis through the middle calyx during ultrasonic guided PNL procedure is more advantageous to lower the calyceal approach by reducing both the duration of the PNL procedure with significantly higher stone-free and comparable complication rates.© 2020 S.

628,"Doses to head and neck normal tissues for early stage Hodgkin lymphoma after involved node radiotherapy. Purpose To evaluate dose plans for head and neck organs at risk (OARs) for classical Hodgkin lymphoma (HL) patients using involved node radiotherapy (INRT) delivered as 3D conformal radiotherapy (3DCRT), volumetric modulated arc therapy (VMAT), and intensity modulated proton therapy (PT), in comparison to the past mantle field (MF). Materials and methods Data from 37 patients with cervical lymph node involvement were used. All patients originally received chemotherapy followed by 3DCRT-INRT (30.6 Gy). A VMAT-INRT, PT-INRT (both 30.6 Gy), and a MF plan (36 Gy) were simulated. Doses to head and neck OARs were compared with cumulative DVHs and repeated measures ANOVA. Results The estimated median mean doses were 15.3, 19.3, 15.4, and 37.3 Gy (thyroid), 10.9, 12.0, 7.9, and 34.5 Gy (neck muscles), 2.3, 11.1, 1.8, and 37.1 Gy (larynx), 1.7, 5.1, 1.3, and 23.8 Gy (pharynx), 0.5, 0.8, 0.01, and 32.3 Gy (ipsilateral parotid), and 2.4, 3.8, 0.7, and 34.7 Gy (ipsilateral submandibular) with 3DCRT, VMAT, PT, and MF (all p < 0.0001), respectively. Conclusion The use of INRT significantly lowered the estimated radiation dose to the head and neck OARs. VMAT appeared suboptimal compared to 3DCRT and PT, and for some patients, PT offered an additional gain. © 2013 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.",Excluded

Background: To evaluate and compare the dosimetric advantages of lateral opposing fields (LOF) and intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) in moderate-to-severe active thyroid-associated ophthalmopathy (TAO) retroorbital irradiation. Material(s) and Method(s): Fifty-eight TAO patients who underwent radiotherapy from 2012 to 2018 were chosen. LOF and IMRT plans were separately developed for each patient. The independent samples t-test was used to compare the differences among conformity index (CI), homogeneity index (HI), dose received by the maximal 95% of the target (D95), and organs-at-risk (OAR) doses between the two groups. Pearson's correlation analysis was used to analyze the relationship between exophthalmos and OAR dose. Result(s): CI and HI in the IMRT group were better than those in the LOF group, but crystal, eyeball, and optic nerve dose were higher than those in the LOF group (P<0.05). There was no significant difference in D95 (P=0.261). In the LOF group, exophthalmos was negatively correlated with crystal and eyeball dose (P= 0.000). However, there was no correlation between these indicators in the IMRT group (P>0.05). In the LOF group, the median observation time was 26 months; the CT value of post-ball adipose tissue, exophthalmos, and clinical activity score was lower than those before treatment (P=0.000), and eyesight was better than that before treatment (P=0.000); 10% (2/20) had dry eyes and 5% (1/20) had decreased vision. Conclusion(s): LOF is safer than IMRT and can make full use of the high exophthalmos of TAO patients to reduce OAR dose.Copyright © 2021 Novin Medical Radiation Institute.

Material(s) and Method(s): The institutional ethics committee approved this study. After imformed consent was obtained, twenty-three patients suffering from a total of 65 HCC lesions were treated with I-125 seed permanent interstitial implantation under the guidance of a 1.5 T conventional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) system. The FSE T2WI, T1 FSPGR, FIESTA 2D, 3D Dyn T1WI sequences were used to guide an 18G MR-compatible needle inserted into the lesions to introduce the I-125 seeds. The response evaluation criteria in solid tumors (RECIST) were used to evaluate the curative effect. Result(s): The needle and I-125 seed were seen clearly on MRI images. The final dose delivered to total decay was 173.46 +/- 32.44 Gy (range, 110-270 Gy) as calculated by postoperative TPS. The complete response (CR) was seen in 22 lesions (33.8%), partial response (PR) in 24 lesions (36.9%), stable disease (SD) in 9 lesions (13.8%), and progressive disease (PD) in 10 lesions (15.4%).

Background: The use of cervical interfacet spacers (CISs) to augment stability and provide solid arthrodesis at the atlantoaxial joint has not been studied in detail. The aim of this work is to report the outcomes with the use of machined allograft CISs at C1-2. Method(s): A retrospective review of 19 patients who underwent an atlantoaxial fusion with the use of CISs was performed. All patients had instability documented with flexion and extension lateral radiographs. This instability was due to trauma, degenerative stenosis, symptomatic C1-2 arthropathy, and os odontoideum. Clinical and radiological outcomes were assessed. Fusion was determined based on a lack of hardware failure, absence of motion on flexion and extension plain X-ray films, and presence of bridging trabecular bone which was most often demonstrated by a computed tomography. Result(s): The mean age was 69.1 +/- 12.9 years. Eight patients had traumatic fractures, six patients had degenerative stenosis, two patients had C2 neuralgia due to C1-2 arthropathy, two patients had C1-2 ligamentous subluxation, and one patient had an unstable os odontoideum. The occiput or subaxial spine was included in the arthrodesis in 10 patients. Rib autograft was utilized in most patients. No patient had postoperative neurological worsening, malposition of hardware, or vertebral artery injury and there were no mortalities. The fusion rate was 95%.

3265,"Stereotactic radiosurgery for essential tremor: Retrospective analysis of a 19-year experience. Background: Essential Tremor (ET) is a common movement disorder that can be disabling. Initial treatment is in the form of medical therapies. Patients with medically refractory ET seek surgical intervention which include radiofrequency thalamotomy, deep brain stimulation, and radiosurgical thalamotomy. Radiosurgical thalamotomy is a minimally invasive surgical option which is especially valuable for elderly and high surgical risk patients. Objective(s): The purpose of this study was to retrospectively analyze the outcomes of stereotactic radiosurgery for patients suffering from medically refractory essential tremor. Method(s): During a 19-year period (1996-2015), 73 patients underwent gamma knife thalamotomy for intractable essential tremor. A median central dose of 140 Gy (range, 130-150) was delivered to the nucleus ventralis intermedius through a single 4-mm isocenter. We used the Fahn-Tolosa-Marin clinical tremor rating scale to score tremor, handwriting, drawing, and ability to drink fluids. The median time to last follow-up was 28 months (range, 6-152). Result(s): After gamma knife thalamotomy, 93.2% improved in tremor. Forty-four patients (60.3%) experienced tremor arrest or barely perceptible tremor. Eighteen patients (24.7%) noted tremor arrest and complete restoration of motor function. Tremor improvement was sustained at last follow-up in 96% of patients who experience tremor relief. Mean tremor score improved from 3.19 before to 1.27 after gamma knife thalamotomy (P < 0.0001). Mean handwriting score improved from 2.97 to 1.25 (P < 0.0001). Mean drawing score improved from 3.16 to 1.26 (P < 0.0001). Mean drinking score improved from 3.14 to 1.56 (P < 0.0001). Imaging follow-up showed three types of lesions: enhancing lesion, streaking along internal capsule on fluid-attenuated inversion recovery, and significant reactive changes. Three patients (4%) experienced temporary adverse radiation effects.

975,"Angiographic and clinical outcomes at 8 months of cutting balloon angioplasty and beta-brachytherapy for native vessel in-stent restenosis (BETACUT): results from a stopped randomized controlled trial. The objective of this study was to assess angiographic and clinical outcomes of cutting balloon (CB) angioplasty and concomitant Sr/Y-90 beta-brachytherapy as a treatment modality for patients with native vessel in-stent restenosis (ISR). Procedural advantages over the standard balloon (SB) have been claimed for the CB. Intracoronary brachytherapy preceded by SB angioplasty is regarded as the treatment of choice in patients with ISR. In an interim analysis of a prospective randomized trial designed for 652 patients, 100 consecutive patients with ISR were assigned to treatment with SB angioplasty (n = 51) or CB angioplasty (n = 49), followed in either case by Sr/Y-90 beta-brachytherapy. Quantitative coronary angiography at baseline, postintervention, and at 8 months was performed by an independent central laboratory. More than 90% of target lesions in the overall patient population were diffuse, with 14% of stents totally occluded. Procedural parameters and immediate angiographic outcomes were essentially the same in either study arm. At 8 months, no statistically significant differences were observed in recurrent angiographic restenosis (SB = 26.1%; CB = 29.5%; P = 0.82), target lesion revascularizations (SB = 13.7%; CB = 8.2%; P = 0.53), and major adverse cardiac events (SB = 15.7%; CB = 8.2%; P = 0.36). In this interim analysis, there was no indication of a beneficial effect of CB use over SB use in terms of angiographic or clinical outcomes at 8-month follow-up. CB angioplasty appears to be as safe and efficacious as SB angioplasty in beta-radiation treatment of patients with predominantly diffuse native vessel ISR. It was decided to discontinue the trial.

2927,"Radiation therapy for intrahepatic recurrence after hepatectomy for hepatocellular carcinoma. BACKGROUND: The intrahepatic recurrence rate after curative hepatectomy for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is high, and management of recurrence is thus important for long-term survival. The use of radiation therapy has been relatively uncommon in the treatment of recurrent HCC., METHODS: Eight patients underwent radiation therapy for recurrent HCC 12-98 months after hepatectomy. Five of them were treated with protons (250 MeV; 68.8-84.5 Gy), and three were treated with X-rays (6 MV; 60 or 70 Gy). One patient received radiation therapy twice for another lesion with a 79-month interval. The target tumors were 1.2-4.5 cm. All patients also underwent transcatheter arterial embolization or other regional therapy., RESULTS: Although transient ascites was found in three patients after radiation therapy, no patient died as a result of the irradiation. Seven patients died 9 months to 4 years (median 1 year 6 months) after radiation therapy. Re-recurrence was observed in the irradiated liver in two patients (local control 78%). Four patients died of lung metastasis after radiation therapy. The median survival time was 3 years 3 months (range 1 year 1 month to 8 years 6 months) after recurrence., CONCLUSION: Multimodality therapy is necessary for the management of recurrence. Radiation therapy could be beneficial when other therapies present some difficulty regarding application or are performed incompletely. It must be emphasized that radiation therapy should be considered in addition to other regional therapies for the treatment of recurrent or re-recurrent HCC, and that radiation therapy can be repeated in selected patients.",Excluded

525,"Nicotinamide Phosphoribosyltransferase Upregulation by Phenylephrine Reduces Radiation Injury in Submandibular Gland. PURPOSE: Radiation therapy for head and neck cancer commonly leads to radiation sialadenitis. Emerging evidence has indicated that phenylephrine pretreatment reduces radiosensitivity in the salivary gland; however, the underlying cytoprotective mechanism remains unclear. Nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase (NAMPT) is not only a key enzyme for the nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide salvage pathway, but also a cytokine participating in cell survival, metabolism, and longevity, with a broad effect on cellular functions in physiology and pathology. However, the regulatory events of NAMPT in response to the irradiated salivary gland are unknown., METHODS AND MATERIALS: The cell viability of primary cultured submandibular gland cells was determined using the PrestoBlue assay. NAMPT expression was measured using reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction and Western blotting in vitro and in vivo. Silent information regulator 1 (SIRT1) and phosphorylated Akt protein levels were examined by Western blotting. The cellular locations of NAMPT and SIRT1 were detected by immunohistochemistry. NAMPT promoter activity was assessed using the luciferase reporter gene assay., RESULTS: NAMPT was mainly distributed in the cytoplasm of granular convoluted tubule cells and ductal cells in normal submandibular glands. mRNA and protein expression of NAMPT was downregulated after radiation but upregulated with phenylephrine pretreatment both in vivo and in vitro. Moreover, the protein expression of phosphorylated Akt and SIRT1 was decreased in irradiated glands, and phenylephrine pretreatment restored the expression of both. SIRT1 was mainly located in the cell nucleus and cytoplasm in the normal submandibular gland. Phenylephrine dramatically enhanced the expression of SIRT1, which was significantly reduced by radiation. Furthermore, phenylephrine induced a marked increase of NAMPT promoter activity., CONCLUSIONS: These findings reveal the regulatory mechanisms of NAMPT expression, which help to understand the mechanism of the cytoprotective role of phenylephrine on irradiated tissues.

3416,"Outcomes and toxicities of definitive radiotherapy and reirradiation using 3-dimensional conformal or intensity-modulated (pencil beam) proton therapy for patients with nasal cavity and paranasal sinus malignancies. Background: Proton therapy (PT) improves outcomes in patients with nasal cavity (NC) and paranasal sinus (PNS) cancers. Herein, the authors have reported to their knowledge the largest series to date using intensity-modulated proton therapy (IMPT) in the treatment of these patients. Method(s): Between 2013 and 2018, a total of 86 consecutive patients (68 of whom were radiation-naive and 18 of whom were reirradiated) received PT to median doses of 70 grays and 67 grays relative biological effectiveness, respectively. Approximately 53% received IMPT. Result(s): The median follow-up was 23.4 months (range, 1.7-69.3 months) for all patients and 28.1 months (range, 2.3-69.3 months) for surviving patients. The 2-year local control (LC), distant control, disease-free survival, and overall survival rates were 83%, 84%, 74%, and 81%, respectively, for radiation-naive patients and 77%, 80%, 54%, and 66%, respectively for reirradiated patients. Among radiation-naive patients, when compared with 3-dimensional conformal proton technique, IMPT significantly improved LC (91% vs 72%; P <.01) and independently predicted LC (hazard ratio, 0.14; P =.01). Sixteen radiation-naive patients (24%) experienced acute grade 3 toxicities; 4 (6%) experienced late grade 3 toxicities (osteoradionecrosis, vision loss, soft-tissue necrosis, and soft tissue fibrosis) (grading was performed according to the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events [version 5.0]). Slightly inferior LC was noted for patients undergoing reirradiation with higher complications: 11% experienced late grade 3 toxicities (facial pain and brain necrosis). Patients treated with reirradiation had more grade 1 to 2 radionecrosis than radiation-naive patients (brain: 33% vs 7% and osteoradionecrosis: 17% vs 3%). Conclusion(s): PT achieved remarkable LC for patients with nasal cavity and paranasal sinus cancers with lower grade 3 toxicities relative to historical reports. IMPT has the potential to improve the therapeutic ratio in these malignancies and is worthy of further investigation.Copyright © 2020 American Cancer Society",Excluded
2917,"Efficacy of three-dimensional contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance angiography (3D CE-MRA) in the diagnosis of thoracic outlet syndrome. Objective: The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effect of various upper extremity positions (adduction-abduction) on vascular structures in contrast-enhanced three-dimensional MR angiographic studies performed in patients with thoracic outlet syndrome. Material(s) and Method(s): Twenty-two consecutive patients with clinical symptoms of neurovascular thoracic outlet syndrome were examined by 1.0 T MR unit. Examinations were studied by three-dimensional contrast-enhanced MR angiography with the arms positioned in abduction and adduction in the same patients. Result(s): In twenty-one of 44 subclavian arteries, impingement or stenosis with different degrees were found. Majority of lesions were localized in the costoclavicular region. Venous phase sequences of contrast-enhanced MR angiography showed compression of the subclavian vein in the 17 areas. Conclusion(s): Thoracic outlet syndrome remains controversial in both diagnosis and treatment, particulary in patients with no muscle atrophy, hand ischemia findings or venous stasis symptoms. Three-dimensional contrast-enhanced MR angiography is noninvasive and requires neither ionizing radiation nor administration of iodinated contrast material- and may be used to diagnose early compression findings and stenosis of the subclavian vessels. © Trakya University Faculty of Medicine.",Excluded
2591,"Prediction of LIVER Toxicity with Stereotactic Body Radiotherapy: A Dosimetric Analysis. Purpose/Objective(s): To further evaluate the corresponding dosimetric factors with the liver toxicity following stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT). Materials/Methods: Between 2015-2018, 76 patients with liver tumor (primary or metastases) treated with SBRT were reviewed based on dosimetric factors and liver function tests. The reference point was contoured that the main portal ven divided in the liver hilum into the left portal vein branch and the right portal vein branch on the contrast enhanced simulation CT scan set. Two different isotropic expansions from the reference point were generated as 2(zone 1) and 4 cm(zon 2). Out of zone 2 was defined as zone 3 in the rest of liver. The radiation doses of each zones were converted BED 10 and tested for correlation with liver functon tests which were obtained during follow up. Liver functions were assessed with Drug-Induced Liver Injury Network (DILIN) grading system for liver disease severity. Result(s): Median follow up was 10 months (range 6-36 months). Four of 76 patients were diagnosed with primary liver tumor(Hepatocellulary ca), rest of 72 patients were diagnosed secondary tumor(kolorectal 30, lung 21, breast 13, other 8). Median age was 64(range 48-76). Sixteen of patients have grade 1 liver disfunction, 4 of patients have grade 2 toxicity after radiotherapy. The prescription doses were 45-60 Gy in 3-5 fractions. Median tumor volume was 24.4 cc(range 8.5-39.9 cc). The volume of received 20 Gy (VBED1020) more than 50 cc in the zone 2, was significantly correlated with grade 1 toxicity(p=0.03). Conclusion(s): These results suggest that the volume of received 20 Gy more than 50 cc dose to 2 cm expansion from reference point in the liver may be associated with acute liver enzyme abnormality. This dosimetric parameter has potential implications for future liver SBRT studies.Copyright © 2019",Excluded
475,"Lung stereotactic body radiation therapy for elderly patients aged >= 80 years with pathologically proven early-stage non-small cell lung cancer: a retrospective cohort study. Background: Stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) is an established therapy for medically inoperable early-stage non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Many elderly patients are medically inoperable owing to comorbidities. Therefore, SBRT may be a useful therapy for elderly patients. However, the application of SBRT for patients aged >= 80 years has not been completely elucidated. Therefore, this study aimed to assess the clinical utility of SBRT for elderly patients aged >= 80 years with pathologically proven early-stage NSCLC. Method(s): We retrospectively evaluated the data of patients aged >= 80 years with pathologically proven primary NSCLC who underwent SBRT at our institution between January 2009 and March 2020. Treatment outcomes and toxicities were analyzed. We used the Kaplan-Meier method to estimate survival curves and the log-rank test to compare the survival curves. We performed univariate and multivariate Cox regression analyses. p-values < 0.05 were regarded significant. Result(s): Sixty-four patients (65 lesions) were included, and the median follow-up period was 38.7 (range 3.5-95.7) months. The median age was 82.9 (range 80.0-94.8) years. Sixteen patients were medically operable, and 48 patients were medically inoperable. The prescribed dose of SBRT was either 48 Gy in four fractions or 60 Gy in 10 fractions. The median survival time was 60.0 months (95% confidence interval, 43.5-71.1). The 1-, 3-, and 5-year local control, cancer-specific survival, progression-free survival, and overall survival rates were 98.4%, 98.4%, 81.0%, and 88.9%; 90.1%, 93.7%, 58.9%, and 68.3%; and 87.4%, 83.5%, 38.2%, and 47.5%, respectively. Multivariate analysis revealed that inoperability and solid nodules were the predictors of poor overall survival after SBRT in elderly patients. Two patients (3.1%) had grade 3 radiation pneumonitis, and one patient (1.6%) had grade 5 radiation pneumonitis. Conclusion(s): SBRT was feasible in patients aged >= 80 years with NSCLC. It achieved good local control with minimal toxicity. SBRT may be beneficial in elderly patients with early-stage NSCLC.Copyright © 2021, The Author(s).",Excluded
2999,"Religious belief as a coping strategy: An explorative trial in patients irradiated for head-and-neck cancer. Purpose: To explore the role of religious belief in coping with disease symptoms and treatment-related side effects in patients with head-and-neck cancer under radiotherapy. Patients and Methods: Prospectively collected data were used with a cohort of head-and-neck cancer patients treated by radiotherapy and epoetin beta or placebo within a double-blind multicenter trial. All patients were divided into believers and nonbelievers. Answers to a quality of life questionnaire at four points in time during radiotherapy were analyzed according to both groups. Clinical parameters and therapy side effects were controlled regularly. Result(s): 62.1% of the patients (66/105) sent back a baseline questionnaire discriminating between believers and nonbelievers. For 34.2% (40/105) data of all four measures could be obtained. On average, believers felt better in all categories of side effects at all points of time before, during and directly after therapy. Conclusion(s): Religious faith seems to play an important role in coping strategies of radiotherapy patients. More research in this area would be worthwhile. © Urban & Vogel.",Excluded
3469,"Impacts of ionising radiation on sperm quality, DNA integrity and post-fertilisation development in marine and freshwater crustaceans. Crustaceans have been designated as internationally important model organisms in the development of environmental radioprotection measures. Despite the known sensitivity of sperm to ionizing radiation, the impacts of chronic radiation exposure on male fertility in crustaceans have not been studied. For the first time, the present study aimed to assess the impacts of chronic radiation exposure on male fertility, sperm DNA damage and concomitant impacts on breeding in two amphipod crustaceans. Echinogammarus marinus and Gammarus pulex (male fertility only) were exposed to phosphorus-32 at dose rates of 0, 0.1, 1 and 10mGy/d and sperm parameters, DNA damage and knock-on impacts on breeding were assessed. Sperm quality parameters and DNA damage were assessed using a fluorescent staining method and single cell gel electrophoresis respectively. Concomitant effects of male exposure to radiation on fecundity were determined by pairing phosphorus-32 exposed males to unexposed sexually mature females. In E. marinus, a statistically significant reduction of 9 and 11% in the quality of sperm was recorded at dose rates of 1 and 10mGy/d respectively, with no significant effects recorded on sperm counts. Conversely in the freshwater G. pulex, no significant impact of radiation on sperm quantity or quality was recorded. For E. marinus, a statistically significant increase in DNA damage was recorded at doses of 10mGy/d. Reduced fecundity and an increase in the frequency of abnormal embryos was recorded in female E. marinus breeding with males exposed to radiation. These findings suggest sperm quality may be a sensitive indicator of radiation exposure in invertebrates with potential impacts on the unexposed embryo, though unclear dose-response and differences between two closely related species necessitate further study before robust conclusions can be drawn.

194,"A phase II trial of accelerated multimodality therapy for locoregionally advanced cancer of the esophagus and gastroesophageal junction: The impact of clinical heterogeneity. OBJECTIVES: This is a report of mature results from a phase II trial of an accelerated multimodality treatment program for locoregionally advanced cancer of the esophagus and gastroesophageal junction with a focus on the impact of clinical heterogeneity on outcomes. A split course of pre- and postoperative hyperfractionated radiation therapy and concurrent chemotherapy was used in an effort to limit perioperative mortality. METHOD(S): Eligibility required a diagnosis of esophageal or gastroesophageal junction cancer and an esophageal ultrasound stage of at least T3, N1, or M1A. Patients received a 12-day induction course of radiation (1.5 Gy twice a dose to a dose of 30 Gy) concurrent with 4-day continuous intravenous infusions of cisplatin (20 mg/m per day) and 5-fluorouracil (1000 mg/m per day) beginning on day 1. Surgery followed in 4 to 6 weeks followed 6 to 10 weeks later by a second, identical course of chemoradiotherapy. RESULT(S): From October 1999 through March 2003, 93 patients were enrolled; 96% were white, 86% male, and 83% had adenocarcinoma. Resection was possible in 83 patients (89%) with 4 (5%) perioperative deaths. With a median follow up of 50 months (range, 34-72 months), the 3-year projected overall survival rate is 27.9%, freedom from recurrence 30.5%, and distant metastatic control 32.4%. Locoregional control in resected patients is 86%. Freedom from recurrence and distant control were significantly better in patients with 1) earlier pretreatment clinical stage, 2) earlier postinduction pathologic stage, 3) squamous cell cancer, and 4) a pathologic response. CONCLUSION(S): This accelerated multimodality treatment program is feasible and perioperative mortality proved acceptable. Despite excellent locoregional control, freedom from recurrence, and overall survival proved disappointing reflecting the frequency of distant metastases. Heterogeneity in patient populations makes comparisons with similar nonrandomized experiences problematic. © 2007 Lippincott Williams & Wilkins, Inc.",Excluded
451,"The evaluation of different radiological measurement parameters of the degree of collapse of the vertebral body in vertebral compression fractures. For compression fracture, vertebral body height loss (VBHL) and kyphotic angle (KA) are two important imaging parameters for determining the prognosis and appropriate treatment. This study used previous measurement methods to assess the degree of VBHL and KA, compare and examine differences between various measurement methods, and examine the correlation between relevant measurement parameters and intravertebral cleft (IVC) in the vertebral body. The radiographic images (lateral view of the T-L spine) of 18 patients with a single-level vertebral compression fracture were reviewed. We measured 9 characteristic lengths and angles on plain radiographs, including anterior vertebral height (AVH) and AVH of the adjacent upper and lower levels, middle vertebral height (MVH) and MVH of the adjacent upper and lower levels, posterior vertebral height (PVH), and vertebral body width, and assessed 6 parameters, including vertebral compression ratio (VBCR), percentage of anterior height compression (PAHC), percentage of middle height compression (PMHC), kyphotic angle (KA), calculated kyphotic angle (CKA), and IVC. The results showed that VBCR is a simple and rapid method of VBHL assessment, but it may result in an underestimation of the degree of VBHL compared to PAHC. When PMHC < 40% or kyphotic angle > 15degree, the probability of IVC occurring on the vertebral body was higher which means the higher risk of vertebral body instability. The results of this study could provide a reference for surgeons when using imaging modalities to assess the degree of vertebral body collapse.Copyright © 2019 Wei-En Hsu et al.

1569,"320-Row Multidetector CT Angiography in the Detection of Critical Cerebrovascular Anomalies. Background: The acquisition of a new 320-row multidetector computed tomography angiography (CTA) scanner at the Montreal Neurological Institute and Hospital has provided higher quality imaging with less radiation exposure and shorter time of acquisition. However, its reliability has not been fully proven in critical vascular lesions when it comes to replacing a more invasive examination such as cerebral angiography. We wished to validate the accuracy of this equipment to investigate four common indications for patients to undergo conventional digital subtraction angiography: subarachnoid hemorrhage, vasospasm, unusual intracerebral hemorrhage, and unruptured aneurysm. Method(s): Radiological reports and relevant imaging from 82 consecutive subjects who underwent a 320-row multidetector CTA followed by cerebral angiography from February 2010 to February 2014 were retrospectively analysed. A total of 102 cerebrovascular anomalies were found. Reports from both imaging modalities were compared to determine the diagnostic accuracy of CTA. Result(s): The overall sensitivity and specificity of 320-row multidetector CTA for detecting cerebrovascular abnormalities were, respectively, 97.60% and 63.20%. Similar results were obtained for all four categories of clinical indications. Conclusion(s): Results obtained from CTA were consistent with those obtained on digital subtraction angiography regardless of the vascular pathology.

BACKGROUND: Left atrial (LA) volume is a predictor of cardiovascular events. Information on LA volume is available on contrast-enhanced electrocardiogram (EGC)-gated multidetector computed tomography (MDCT) scans., OBJECTIVE: To assess interobserver and intraobserver reproducibility of 3-dimensional threshold-based volume (3DTV) and 2-dimensional (2D) measurements for the assessment of LA volumes with contrast-enhanced cardiac 64-slice MDCT., METHODS: Contrast-enhanced 64-slice MDCT (0.6-mm slice thickness, 120 kVp, 850 mAseff) was performed in 96 consecutive subjects (mean age 52 years; 48% women) as a subset of the Rule Out Myocardial Infarction using Computer Assisted Tomography trial. Two observers independently measured maximal (LAV(max)) and minimal (LAV(min)) LA volumes with (1) a modified Simpson's method (3DTV) based on delineation of LA areas in axial slices and (2) estimated LA volumes typically used in 2D echocardiography (area length and prolate ellipse). Interobserver and intraobserver reproducibility for each method as well as correlations between the methods were calculated., RESULTS: Interobserver (n = 96) and intraobserver (n = 20) variability was significantly lower for 3DTV (8%) than for area length (13%; P < 0.001) or prolate ellipse (16%; P < 0.001). 2D-based measurements rendered significantly lower LA volumes than did 3DTV (area length: -17% and -22%; prolate ellipse: -43% and -46% for LAV(max) and LAV(min), respectively; P < 0.001 for all). By 3DTV, mean LA volume was 90.4 +/- 24.5 mL for LAV(max) and 52.5 +/- 17.6 mL for LAV(min)., CONCLUSION: ECG-gated contrast-enhanced cardiac MDCT offers volumetric assessment of LA volume with excellent reproducibility without additional contrast administration or radiation exposure. 3D measures of LA volume are more reproducible and render larger volumes than 2D-derived estimates, typically used in echocardiography.",Excluded

Recently, promising results of the antitumor effects were observed in patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer treated with177Lu-labeled PSMA-ligands. Radionu-clide therapy efficacy may even be improved by using the alpha emitter Ac-225. Higher efficacy is claimed due to high linear energy transfer specifically towards PSMA positive cells, causing more double-strand breaks. This study aims to manufacture [225Ac]Ac-PSMA-I&T according to good manufacturing practice guidelines for the translation of [225Ac]Ac-PSMA-I&T into a clinical phase 1 dose escalation study. Quencher addition during labeling was investigated. Quality control of [225Ac]Ac-PSMA-I&T was based on measurement of Fr-221 (218 keV), in equilibrium with Ac-225 in approximately six half-lives of Fr-221 (T12 = 4.8 min). Radio-(i)TLC methods were utilized for identification of the different radiochemical forms, gamma counter for concentration determination, and HPGe-detector for the detection of the radiochemical yield. Radiochemical purity was determined by HPLC. The final patient dose was prepared and diluted with an optimized concentration of quenchers as during labeling, with an activity of 8-12 MBq (+/-5%), pH > 5.5, 100 +/- 20 microg/dose, PSMA-I&T, radiochemical yield >95%, radiochemical purity >90% (up to 3 h), endotoxin levels of <5 EU/mL, osmolarity of 2100 mOsmol, and is produced according to current guidelines.

856,"Cardiac computed tomography previous to atrial fibrillation ablation - effects of technological improvements and protocol optimization. BACKGROUND: Cardiac computed tomography (CT) can provide a precise tridimentional anatomic map and exclude intra-cardiac thrombus. We aimed to access the impact of CT protocol optimization and technological evolution on the contrast and radiation dose as well as on image quality previous to atrial fibrillation (AF) ablation., METHODS: From a prospective registry of consecutive patients who underwent cardiac CT in a single center, we selected 270 patients in whom the CT was done for evaluation prior to AF ablation and they were distributed in 3 groups: Group1: the first 150 patients included; Group2: the last 60 patients performed with the same CT scanner; Group3: the first 60 exams performed with the new CT scanner. Quality of the protocol was access based on radiation dose, contrast volume used, the use of a second (delayed) acquisition, and on quantitative image quality analisis (signal to noise and contrast to noise ratios; density homogeneity racio between LA and LAA)., RESULTS: We found a significant radiation dose as well as contrast dose reduction between the first and last subgroups (G1: 5,6mSv and 100ml; G2: 1,3mSv and 90ml; G3: 0,6mSv and 65ml). Even though group 3 had less radiation and contrast used it still had better quantitative image quality (signal/noise of 13,5; contrast/noise 14,8; density homogeneity racio of 0,92)., CONCLUSION: Protocol optimization and technology both contributed to significant lower radiation dose and contrast volume used on cardiac CTs prior to AF ablation, without compromising image quality.

53,"31P NMR spectroscopy can predict the optimum interval between fractionated irradiation doses. This study was performed to clarify whether changes in the metabolites observed by phosphorous-31 magnetic resonance spectroscopy (31P-MRS) could indicate an optimum interval between two doses of radiation in a murine tumor model. Murine mammary carcinoma cells, FM3A, were irradiated 7 days after transplantation with a single 5 Gy dose without anesthesia. 31P spectra were measured with a spectrometer up to 30 days. The beta-ATP/Pi and PCr/Pi values were calculated from the peak area of each spectrum. In a fractionation experiment, two fractions of irradiation at a 5 Gy per fraction were given at 0, 1, 2, 3 and 6 day intervals. Tumor growth delay was also scored to determine the fractionated radiation effect. In the control group, beta-ATP/Pi and PCr/Pi decreased with tumor growth. In the single irradiation group, the tumor did not grow up to day 6, and an initial rise and subsequent decrease in beta-ATP/Pi and PCr/Pi were observed. Maximum beta-ATP/Pi and PCr/Pi were observed on day 2 after irradiation. In a fractionation experiment, the greatest growth delay was observed in the two day interval group, in which maximum beta-ATP/Pi and PCr/Pi were demonstrated in 31P-MRS. Our results suggested that changes in the metabolites observed by 31P-MRS could be useful indicators for determining the fractionation schedule in radiation therapy.",Excluded
1483,"Protective Effects of Magnesium Sulfate on Radiation Induced Brain Injury in Rats. OBJECTIVES: The effect of magnesium sulfate on brain tissue of SD rats irradiated by 6MeV electron was investigated., METHODS: SD rats were divided into three groups: control group, irradiation (IR group) and irradiation treated with magnesium sulfate (IR+M group). After being anesthetized, the whole brains of IR group and IR+M group were exposed to 6 MeV electron radiation. IR+M group was i.p. injected with 10% magnesium sulfate (400 mg/kg) one day before radiation and three days and five days after radiation. And on the 1st, 3rd, 7th and 14th day after radiation, SD rats were euthanatized to take brain tissue for the detection of calcium, redox status and cell apoptosis, as well as the expression of NF-kappaB and ICAM-1., RESULTS: The results indicated that magnesium treatment may alleviate the elevation of calcium and enhance redox status through increasing the activities of superoxide dimutase (SOD) and myeloperodase (MPO), and decreasing the concentration of malondialdehyde (MDA). Tunnel and immunohistochemistry assay suggested that treatment with magnesium decreased the apoptosis rate of brain cells and the expressions of caspase-3, respectively. Decline of the expression of NF-kappaB and ICAM-1 protein was observed after the treatment of magnesium., CONCLUSION: All the results demonstrated that magnesium may elicit protective effect against radiationinduced brain injury by reducing calcium overload, improving redox and inhibiting cell apoptosis. Moreover, magnesium significantly down-regulated the protein or mRNA levels of NF-kappaB and ICAM- 1. The findings may provide references for the application of magnesium in clinic for brain injury induced by radiation.

2698,"Proton beam therapy versus stereotactic body radiotherapy for hepatocellular carcinoma: Practice patterns, outcomes, and the effect of biologically effective dose escalation. Background: Stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) and proton beam therapy (PBT) generally are safe and effective for non-operative hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). To date, data comparing the two modalities are limited. We aimed to identify the practice patterns and outcomes of nonsurgical HCC cases treated definitively with either SBRT or PBT. Method(s): We queried the National Cancer Database for T1-2N0 HCC patients receiving PBT or SBRT from 2004 to 2015. Patients were excluded for any treatment other than non-palliative external beam radiotherapy. A multivariable binomial regression model identified patterns of SBRT/PBT use, and propensity-matched multivariable Cox regression assessed correlates of survival. Result(s): A total of 71 patients received PBT and 918 patients received SBRT (median follow-up 45 months). SBRT was used in 1.8% of nonoperative early stage HCC cases in 2004 and 4.2% of cases in 2015, whereas PBT was used in 0.1-0.2% of cases every year. The median biologically effective dose (BED) for SBRT and PBT was 100 Gy10 and 98 Gy10, respectively (OR =0.70, P=0.17). Factors predictive of receiving PBT included: white race, higher comorbidity score, higher education, metropolitan residence, tumors >5 cm and recent treatment (all P<0.05). Both PBT (HR =0.48, 95% CI: 0.29-0.78) and BED >=100 Gy10 (HR =0.61, 95% CI: 0.38-0.98) were independent predictors for longer survival. Conclusion(s): Although not implying causation and requiring prospective corroboration, PBT was independently associated with longer survival than SBRT, despite being delivered to HCC patients with multiple poor prognostic factors. PBT may also allow for safer BED escalation, which also independently associated with outcomes.Copyright © 2019 Journal of Gastrointestinal Oncology.",Excluded
2914,"Influence of chronic UV exposure and lifestyle on facial skin photo-aging--results from a pilot study. In order to better understand the effect of chronic sun exposure on facial skin photo-aging and to identify the factors affecting it, we planned a study in two areas in Japan, Akita and Kagoshima, which correspond to the low and high sun exposure environments, respectively. As a first step, we conducted a pilot study in the two areas, examining 195 subjects. Hyper-pigmentation and wrinkling were measured with a high-resolution digital video imaging system. As expected, people in Kagoshima had darker skin, higher visual grades of facial hyper-pigmentation, and more facial wrinkles than people in Akita, reflecting the difference of UV exposure levels in the two areas. Both the grades of hyper-pigmentation and number of wrinkles increased in a roughly linear fashion with the advancement of age. On the other hand, the effect of gender was different in those two skin photo-aging parameters. Women had higher hyper-pigmentation grades (P = 0.012) and less wrinkles (P = 0.004) than men. Interestingly, post-menopausal women had higher grades of hyper-pigmentation than pre-menopausal women. Neither sun exposure index for darkness nor wrinkling showed any significant differences by menopausal status. In this pilot study, we collected information on various factors, including life-styles. The results of detail analysis will be presented elsewhere. In the present analysis, we found that the grade of hyper-pigmentation was not related to total hours spent outside in life but was affected by various factors, including toe-nail zinc levels. On the other hand, the number of wrinkles was significantly related to total hours spent outside in life. The most important risk factors of non-melanoma skin cancer are chronic sun exposure, age and male sex. All of them are strongly related to higher levels of UV exposure. The present study confirmed that chronic sun exposure, age and male sex were strong risk factors of the wrinkle number. The number of wrinkles was significantly related to total hours of sun exposure in life, increased in a roughly linear fashion with the advancement of age, and was larger in men than in women. In epidemiological studies of UV-related skin cancer, the number of wrinkles, which can be easily measured with a high-resolution digital video imaging system as shown in this study, may be a good marker of total sun exposure in life.",Excluded

219,"Pre-apoptotic response to therapeutic DNA damage involves protein modulation of Mcl-1, Hdm2 and Flt3 in acute myeloid leukemia cells. BACKGROUND: Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cells are characterized by non-mutated TP53, high levels of Hdm2, and frequent mutation of the Flt3 receptor tyrosine kinase. The juxtamembrane mutation of FLT3 is the strongest independent marker for disease relapse and is associated with elevated Bcl-2 protein and p53 hyper-phosphorylation in AML. DNA damage forms the basic mechanism of cancer cell eradication in current therapy of AML. Hdm2 and pro-apoptotic Bcl-2 members are among the most intensely induced genes immediately after chemotherapy and Hdm2 is proposed a role in receptor tyrosine kinase regulation. Thus we examined the DNA damage related modulation of these proteins in relation to FLT3 mutational status and induction of apoptosis., RESULTS: Within one hour after exposure to ionizing radiation (IR), the AML cells (NB4, MV4-11, HL-60, primary AML cells) showed an increase in Flt3 protein independent of mRNA levels, while the Hdm2 protein decreased. The FLT3 mutant MV4-11 cells were resistant to IR accompanied by presence of both Mcl-1 and Hdm2 protein three hours after IR. In contrast, the FLT3 wild type NB4 cells responded to IR with apoptosis and pre-apoptotic Mcl-1 down regulation. Daunorubicin (DNR) induced continuing down regulation of Hdm2 and Mcl-1 in both cell lines followed by apoptosis., CONCLUSION: Both IR and DNR treatment resulted in concerted protein modulations of Mcl-1, Hdm2 and Flt3.

2371,"MR enterography in the investigation of unexplained abdominal pain. Introduction: Magnetic Resonance Enterography (MRE) has an established role in the management of patients with small bowel (SB) Crohn's disease (CD)1 and has the advantages of diagnosing extra-enteric lesions which may be clinically significant2 and being free from the risks of radiation exposure. There is little published data on the use of MRE in the investigation of patients with unexplained chronic abdominal pain. Method(s): A retrospective review of casenotes was conducted of patients who underwent MRE at Southend University Hospital to investigate unexplained abdominal pain and suspected SB disease between January 2008 and October 2010. The patients did not have a pre-existing diagnosis of CD made by colonoscopy or capsule endoscopy (CE). Demographic data, symptoms, previous investigations and final diagnosis were recorded. MRE was performed using a 1.5 Tesla MR scanner following a minimum 6-hour fast and preparation with Klean prep an hour prior to the scan. Two T2-weighted sequences single-shot fast spin-echo and fast imaging employing steady state acquisition were performed in the axial and coronal planes. Result(s): 181 patients (60 male, 121 female) underwent MRE: 43 also had diarrhoea, 14 weight loss and 13 vomiting. The median age was 39 years (range 13 - 85). MRE found clinically significant abnormalities in 33 patients (18.2%): 18/33 had a prior abdominal CT scan, MRE was used to clarify CT findings in 9/33. Findings are as follows: - 12 SB CD (3 CT suggestive) - 3 SB carcinoid tumour (1 CT suggestive, 1 CE suggestive) - 4 adhesional SB obstruction (2 CT abnormal) - 1 SB stricture - 1 gastric GIST - confirmed at resection (normal CT and gastroscopy) - 1 jejunal tumour - adenocarcinoma at resection (normal CT) - 1 duodenal mass with intussusception - villous adenoma at resection (OGD and CT suggestive) - 1 ovarian endometrioma and 1 renal cell carcinoma - confirmed at biopsy or resection - 1 peritoneal metastases - metastatic breast carcinoma at biopsy (CT: colonic thickening and free fluid) - 1 intussusception - 1 splenic mass (CT: splenic mass, granulomatous disease on resection) - 1 retroperitoneal nodes and splenomegaly (CT similar findings, further investigation hypogammaglobulinaemia) - 1 persistent vitello-intestinal cyst (CT normal, confirmed on resection) - 1 gallstones and cholecystitis - 1 PUJ obstruction (CT similar findings) - 1 colonic diverticular disease Conclusion(s): MRE is a useful investigation for unexplained chronic abdominal pain in patients not known to have CD. It yields clinically significant enteric and extra-enteric findings and carries no risk of radiation exposure.",Excluded
2954,"Skin cancer in heart transplant recipients: frequency and risk factor analysis. BACKGROUND: The frequency of skin cancer is increased among organ transplant recipients, but the predisposing risk factors are controversial. It is also unclear whether heart transplant patients face an increased risk compared to recipients of other organs, e.g. kidney transplants., METHODS: We performed univariate and multivariate analysis of risk factors for skin cancer in 252 heart transplants and in a control series of 228 kidney transplants followed up at a single center. An extensive dermatologic examination was carried out; baseline features, type of immunosuppression, number of 3A rejection episodes, extent of sunlight exposure and skin type were recorded. Multivariate analysis (Cox regression) included: age at transplantation, sex, skin type (Fitzpatrick's criteria), presence of solar keratosis, presence of warts, type of organ, sunlight exposure., RESULTS: During follow up skin cancer was more common among heart transplants (40, 16 %) than in kidney transplants (16, 7%, p = 0.004). The cumulative incidence of skin cancer by life table analysis increased from 16% after 5 years to 33% after 10 years in heart transplant patients and from 6% to 17% in kidney transplants (p 10000 hours (relative risk = 2.8), but not organ type were significant risk factors., CONCLUSION: Age at transplant, skin type and sunlight exposure, but not type of organ and type of immunosuppressive regimen, are associated with increased risk of skin cancer in heart transplantation.",Excluded
2379,"Colon or rectal stent positioning for advanced cancer influences quality of life: A critical point of view. Background/Aim: Endoluminal self-expanding metallic stents (SEMS) may overcome the risk of mortality and morbidity of acute intestinal obstruction because of stage IV colon (CC) or rectal (RC) cancer. We evaluated the QoL in these groups of patients. Patients and Methods: Forty-eight patients were enrolled in a prospective longitudinal cohort single-center trial to undergo SEMS positioning. Twenty-five patients had a CC and 23 RC. Karnofsky performance scale, Visual Analogue Scale and the EQ-5D- 5LTM questionnaire were administered before treatment and at 1, 3 and 6 months. Result(s): Harmonized to the Italian population, the index values showed a statistically significant deterioration of the QoL in patients with RC when compared to those with CC at 1-, 3- and 6-months (1 month: p=0.001; 3- month: p=0.001; 6-month: p=0.045). Similarly, Visual Analogue Scale showed variations at 1- (p=0.008), 3- (p=0.001) and 6-months (p=0.020). Rectal stent deployment was the only independent predictor for a worse QoL in all domains (p<0.017; OR=0.196; 95%CI=0.51- 0.749). Conclusion(s): Patients affected with stage IV CC had a better QoL after SEMS placement when compared to those affected with RC. The persistency of the primary tumor at the rectal level, even if irradiated, might negatively affect QoL.Copyright © 2021 International Institute of Anticancer Research.

1336,"What are the clinical and technical factors that influence the kerma-area product in percutaneous coronary intervention?. The purpose of the paper is to define predictors of the kerma-area product (KAP) in percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). Two new digital X-ray interventional cardiology systems recently installed were included. A total of 398 PCI procedures were carried out by 6 board-certified senior interventional cardiologists with more than 15 years' experience and good knowledge of radiation protection measures. Clinical, radiation and procedural data were collected based on a detailed protocol developed by the SENTINEL cardiology subgroup. Correlation with clinical and procedure factors was then investigated. A significant correlation was found between fluoroscopy time and (i) lesion classification, (ii) the level of tortuosity and (iii) the number of vessels treated. No statistically significant differences were observed in the complexity of the case between operators. However, large differences were found in the KAP among operators, which were mostly attributed to the different number of frames taken by each operator. There was no statistically significant correlation between complexity and the total number of frames. The study showed that, in certain circumstances, the clinical need to successfully perform PCI takes precedence over radiation safety concerns.",Excluded
3674,"Trends in the incidence of sudden deaths and heart diseases in fukushima after the great east Japan earthquake. On March 11, 2011, a great earthquake, known as the Great East Japan Earthquake, hit northeastern Japan, resulting in a tsunami that caused a nuclear disaster, the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant accident, forcing about 160,000 people to evacuate. We, therefore, sought to examine the effects of this evacuation on the onset of cardiovascular diseases and sudden death (SD) in Fukushima Prefecture, three years after the earthquake. We divided the evacuation zone into two areas, whole evacuation zone (Area 1) and partial evacuation zone (Area 2), and we defined the north district of the prefecture as the control area (Area 3). We cross-referenced the death certificate data with data from the Fukushima Prefecture acute myocardial infarction registration survey. For each area, we tallied the number of people who fell into the SD, myocardial infarction (MI), and MI suspected groups. We calculated the age-adjusted incidence rates and analyzed the differences in the adjusted incidence rates across three years using a Poisson regression model. The age-adjusted death rate of the SD group was significantly higher in 2011 in all areas than in 2012 or 2013 (P < 0.05). The total death rate was higher in Area 1 in March 2011, just after the disaster, than in the other two areas. The rate of SD was also higher in Area 1 than in the other areas in March 2011. The incidence of sudden cardiac death might have increased just after the Great East Japan Earthquake in the evacuation area, but not in other areas in Fukushima Prefecture.Copyright © 2019, International Heart Journal Association.

2294,"Radiofrequency ablation is beneficial in simultaneous treatment of synchronous liver metastases and primary colorectal cancer. Background: In patients with resectable synchronous colorectal liver metastases (CRLM), either twostaged or simultaneous resections of the primary tumor and liver metastases are performed. Data on radiofrequency ablation (RFA) for the treatment of CRLM during a simultaneous procedure is lacking. The primary aim was to analyze short-term and long-term outcome of RFA in simultaneous treatment. A secondary aim was to compare simultaneous resection with the colorectal-first approach. Method(s): Retrospective analysis of 241 patients with colorectal cancer and synchronous CRLM between 2000-2016. Median follow-up was 36.1 months (IQR 18.2-58.8 months). A multivariable analysis was performed to analyze the postoperative morbidity, using the comprehensive complication index. A propensity matched analysis was performed to compare survival rates. Result(s): In multivariable analysis, the best predictor of lower complication severity was treatment with RFA (p = 0.040). Higher complication rates were encountered in patients who underwent an abdominoperineal resection (p = 0.027) or age > 60 years (p = 0.022). The matched analysis showed comparable overall survival in RFA treated patients versus patients undergoing a liver resection with a five year overall survival of 39.4% and 37.5%, respectively (p = 0.782). In a second matched analysis, 5-year overall survival rates in simultaneously treated patients (43.8%) was comparable to patients undergoing the colorectal first approach (43.0%, p = 0.223). Conclusion(s): RFA treatment of CRLM in simultaneous procedures is associated with a lower complication severity and non-inferior oncological outcome as compared to partial liver resection. RFA should be considered a useful alternative to liver resection.Copyright © 2018 Hof et al.

1555,"Postcontrast T1 Mapping for Differential Diagnosis of Recurrence and Radionecrosis after Gamma Knife Radiosurgery for Brain Metastasis. BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The differential diagnosis of radionecrosis and tumor recurrence in brain metastases is challenging. We investigated the diagnostic efficiency of postcontrast T1 mapping in solving this problem., MATERIALS AND METHODS: Between March 2016 and June 2017, fifty-six patients with brain metastases who underwent contrast-enhanced cerebral T1 mapping were recruited for this prospective study. The findings revealed new enhancement after gamma knife radiosurgery. The subjects were assigned to radionecrosis and recurrence groups based on follow-up (median, 11.5 months) and histopathologic results. T1 values of lesions 5 (T15min) and 60 (T160min) minutes after administration of contrast agent and their difference (T1differ) were compared between the 2 groups with the 2-tailed Mann-Whitney U test. Receiver operating characteristic curves were used to determine the optimum cutoff values for differential diagnosis., RESULTS: There were significant differences between the 2 groups in T15min, T160min, and T1differ values (P = .012, P = .004, and P < .001, respectively). Relative to T15min and T160min, T1differ exhibited greater sensitivity and specificity (P < .001, respectively) in identifying radionecrosis. The optimum T1differ value for differential diagnosis was 71.1 ms (area under the curve = 0.97; 95% CI, 0.93-1.00), with sensitivity and specificity of 81.5% and 96.5%, respectively., CONCLUSIONS: Postcontrast T1 mapping is optimal for the differential diagnosis of radionecrosis and tumor recurrence. Among T1 parameters, T1differ is the most powerful parameter for differential diagnosis. Advantages in terms of quantitative analysis and high resolution portend the wide use of postcontrast T1 mapping in the future. Copyright © 2018 by American Journal of Neuroradiology.",Excluded
3166,"Combined stent insertion and single high-dose brachytherapy in patients with advanced esophageal cancer - results of a prospective safety study. Previous randomized studies comparing the two commonly used palliative treatments for incurable esophageal cancer, i.e. stent insertion and intraluminal brachytherapy, have revealed the pros and cons of each therapy. While stent treatment offers a more prompt effect, brachytherapy results in more long-lasting relief of dysphagia and a better health-related quality of life (HRQL) in those living longer. This prospective pilot study aimed to explore the feasibility and safety of combining these two regimes and incorporating a single high dose of internal radiation. Patients with newly diagnosed, incurable cancer of the esophagus and dysphagia were eligible for inclusion, and stent insertion followed by a single dose (12Gy) of brachytherapy was performed as a two-stage procedure. Clinical parameters including HRQL and adverse events were registered at inclusion, and 1, 2, 3, 6, and 12 months later. Twelve patients (nine males) with a median age of 73 years (range 54-85) were included. Stent insertion followed by a single dose of brachytherapy was successfully performed in all but one patient who was treated with stent only. Relief of dysphagia was achieved in the majority of cases (10/11, P < 0.05), but HRQL did not improve except for dysphagia-related items. Only minor adverse events, including chest pain, reflux, and restenosis, were reported. The median survival time after inclusion was 6.6 months. Our conclusion is that the combination of stent insertion and single high-dose brachytherapy seems to be a feasible and safe palliative regime in patients with advanced esophageal cancer. Randomized trials comparing the efficacy of this strategy to stent insertion or brachytherapy alone are warranted. © 2011, Wiley Periodicals, Inc. and the International Society for Diseases of the Esophagus.",Excluded

Objective: The aim of this analysis to describe the value of PET/CT in detecting primary site of malignancy in our patient population with histologically proven metastasis or with a high clinical suspicion of malignancy. Method(s): A total of 52 patients (24 male, 28 female; mean age: 55.1+/-14.3; age range: 21-82 years) who had PET/CT in our department due to histologically proven metastasis or had a high clinical suspicion for malignancy were included in the study. The results of 18F-FDG PET/CT and clinical follow-up data were reviewed retrospectively. Histologically analysis and/or clinical follow-up data were accepted gold standard in the confirmation 18F-FDG PET/CT results. Patients were evaluated in two groups as 29 patients with histologically proven metastasis (group 1) and 23 patients with clinical suspicion of malignancy (group 2). Result(s): Primary site of malignancy was discovered in 16 of 52 patients (30.7%) histologically. Twelve of 16 patients (75%) was in group 1 and 4 patients was in group 2. In the remaining patients (36/52; 69.3%) primary tumor sites were not found by PET/CT. The findings for group 1 and 2 were TN in 15 and 18 patients, respectively. In 3 patients, 18F-FDG PET/CT findings were discordant with gold standard and all of them had FP findings. Primary tumor site could not be determined in none of patients with negative PET/CT.

This questionnaire survey reveals that the higher the frequency of radiation education, the higher the knowledge of radiation the workers will have, and that the higher the level of knowledge, the lower the anxiety. To reduce anxiety, it is important to increase knowledge about radiation through radiation education. However, even those workers who had radiation education several times still had anxiety. According to the Ordinance on the Prevention of Ionizing Radiation Hazards, the time spent on education about the effects of radiation on the human body is only about 30 minutes. This education is not enough to reduce anxiety. FDNPP workers needed more effective education to increase their knowledge and to reduce their anxiety.",Excluded
64,"Computer-assisted surgery for dynamic hip screw, using Surgix, a novel intraoperative guiding system. BACKGROUND: We present Surgix, a new computer-assisted surgery system (CASS). This system uses image analysis technology in order to measure three-dimensional (3D) distances, visualize implant templates and view the guided trajectory on standard fluoroscopy. Our purpose was to compare surgery results and technique with and without the Surgix CASS., METHODS: The study included 61 dynamic hip screw (DHS) procedures. The Surgix system was used in 41 procedures. We compared the number of guide wire insertion trials and the time needed for each trial, the number of X-ray pulses, tip-apex index, nine-quadrant position and shaft-neck angle., RESULTS: The procedures were carried out by experienced users (> or = five operations, using the system) and had a first-trial guide wire insertion success rate of 77.8%, compared to a rate of 10% for the control group (p = 0.001) and fewer insertion trials (1.33 vs. 3.05, respectively; p = 0.001).

1755,"Reduced end-systolic pressure-volume ratio response to exercise: A marker of subclinical myocardial disease in type 2 diabetes. Background-Limitations in the predictive value of negative exercise echocardiography in type 2 diabetes mellitus has been linked to a reduced end-systolic pressure-volume response (ESPVR). We sought whether abnormal ESPVR reflected subclinical diabetic heart disease by examining the association between the ESPVR and markers of myocardial dysfunction and to establish if the change (delta) or peak systolic blood pressure/end-systolic left ventricular volume ratio (SP/ESV) is a better marker of contractile reserve in type 2 diabetes mellitus. Methods and Results-Resting and exercise echocardiography was performed in 167 apparently healthy patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (97 men; age, 55+/-10 years) without ischemia, other cardiac disease, or noncardiac complications of diabetes. Standard echocardiographic and color tissue Doppler measures (early diastolic tissue velocity, strain, and strain rate) were acquired at baseline and peak stress in apical long-axis views. Calibrated integrated backscatter was calculated from a resting parasternal long-axis view. deltaSP/ESV was calculated as [(peak stress SP/ESV)-(rest SP/ESV)]. The 83 subjects who demonstrated a deltaSP/ESV <=12 mm Hg/mL/m2 after exercise were older and had lower peak heart rate, resting diastolic and stress systolic tissue velocity, stress ejection fraction, and exercise capacity than the remainder. There was no significant association between deltaSP/ESV and metabolic derangement or echocardiographic measures of deformation or backscatter. Change in Sm and stress ejection fraction were independent correlates of deltaSP/ESV. Conclusions-deltaSP/ESV ratio is associated with established features of subclinical diabetic heart disease as well as determinants of contractile reserve (peak hemodynamic response and stress systolic function). Peak ESPVR is poorly associated with markers of myocardial dysfunction. © 2010 American Heart Association, Inc.",Excluded

2933,"Long-term results after proton beam therapy for retinal papillary capillary hemangioma. Purpose To evaluate the potential benefit and risk of proton beam therapy in the treatment of symptomatic retinal papillary capillary hemangioma. Design Retrospective interventional case series. Methods This study included patients presenting with symptomatic exudative retinal papillary capillary hemangioma with or without association with von Hippel-Lindau disease. All patients were treated either as a first or a secondary treatment option by proton beam therapy between 2001 and 2009. The minimum follow-up was 30 months. Results Eight eyes of 8 patients (3 male and 5 female, with a mean age of 36 years [range 22-80 years]) were treated for symptomatic papillary retinal hemangioma. The median interval between onset of macular edema and proton beam therapy was 1.7 months (range 0.5-3.3 months). The median follow-up period was 84 months (range 32-106 months) between proton beam treatment and last follow-up. Exudation completely resolved in all but 1 patient after 4.2 months on average (range 2.8-7.2 months). Mean visual acuity prior to proton beam irradiation was 0.7 logMAR (0.2 DIN (DIN 58220 norm)) (range 2-0.3 logMAR) and declined to 0.8 logMAR (0.16 DIN; range 2-0.1 logMAR) at last follow-up examination (no statistical significance, P =.071). Conclusion The anatomic outcome after proton beam therapy for retinal papillary hemangioma is convincing, whereas functional outcome may be compromised because of tumor location, long-persisting macular edema, extensive exudation, and poor initial visual acuity. In patients with extended retinal detachment surgical intervention was still necessary. Although proton beam therapy is proven to be a therapeutic option, treatment will remain challenging. © 2014 by Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.",Excluded

For assessment, wound measurement was done before, during and after treatment and wound healing time as well as lab tests like swab culture, X-ray of affected part, Hemoglobin, Total Leucocytes Count, Differential Leucocytes Count, Liver Function Test, blood sugar level and HbA1c were recorded. Patients with tubercular, malignant ulcers and with ulcers of less than 6 weeks duration were excluded from the study.

AIM: Tumor response and normal tissue toxicity of seven-day-per-week continuous accelerated irradiation (CAIR) for patients with esophageal carcinoma were evaluated and compared to conventional irradiation (CR)., METHODS: Sixty patients with squamous cell carcinoma of the esophagus were randomized into two groups: the CAIR group (30 patients) and the CR group (30 patients). Patients in the CAIR group received radiotherapy (RT) with 2 Gy/fraction per day at 7 d/wk with a total dose of 50-70 Gy (average dose 64.2 Gy). The overall time of irradiation was 3.6-5.0 wk (average 4.6 wk). RT in the CR group was 2 Gy/fraction per day at 5 d/wk with a total dose of 40-70 Gy (average dose 61.7 Gy). The overall time of irradiation was 4.0-7.0 wk (average 6.4 wk)., RESULTS: The data showed that the immediate tumor response to RT was better in the CAIR group than in the CR group. Efficiency rates (CR plus PR) were 82.8% (24/29) and 58.6% (17/29), respectively (P = 0.047). In both groups the incidences of esophagitis and tracheitis were insignificant (P = 0.376, 0.959), and no patient received toxicity that could not be tolerated., CONCLUSION: CAIR shortens overall treatment time and is well tolerated by patients.

AIM: To assess the utility of a volumetric low-dose computed tomography (CT) thorax (LDCTT) protocol at a dose equivalent to a posteroanterior (PA) and lateral chest radiograph for surveillance of cystic fibrosis (CF) patients. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A prospective study was undertaken of 19 adult patients with CF that proceeded to LDCTT at 12 and 24 months following initiation of ivacaftor. A previously validated seven-section, low-dose axial CT protocol was used for the 12-month study. A volumetric LDCTT protocol was developed for the 24-month study and reconstructed with hybrid iterative reconstruction (LD-ASIR) and pure iterative reconstruction (model-based IR [LD-MBIR]). Radiation dose was recorded for each scan. Image quality was assessed quantitatively and qualitatively, and disease severity was assessed using a modified Bhalla score. Statistical analysis was performed and p-values of <0.05 were considered statistically significant. RESULT(S): Volumetric LD-MBIR studies were acquired at a lower radiation dose than the seven-section studies (0.08 +/- 0.01 versus 0.10 +/- 0.02 mSv; p=0.02). LD-MBIR and seven-section ASIR images had significantly lower levels of image noise compared with LD-ASIR images (p<0.0001). Diagnostic acceptability scores and depiction of bronchovascular structures were found to be acceptable for axial and coronal LD-MBIR images. LD-MBIR images were superior to LD-ASIR images for all qualitative parameters assessed (p<0.0001). No significant change was observed in mean Bhalla score between 1-year and 2-year studies (p=0.84). CONCLUSION(S): The use of a volumetric LDCTT protocol (reconstructed with pure IR) enabled acquisition of diagnostic quality CT images, which were considered extremely useful for surveillance of CF patients, at a dose equivalent to a PA and lateral chest radiograph.Copyright © 2021 The Royal College of Radiologists",Excluded

OBJECTIVE: The purpose of the study was to evaluate acute normal tissue reactions and treatment compliance in a randomized clinical trial on 7-days-a-week post-operative radiotherapy (p-CAIR) vs post-operative concurrent radiochemotherapy (p-RTCT) in locally advanced cancer of the oral cavity/oropharynx. The sample analyzed at present represents approximately 30% of the intended future trial size., METHODS: The patients were randomly assigned to receive 63 Gy in 1.8-Gy fractions 7 days a week (n = 44) or 63 Gy in 1.8-Gy fractions 5 days a week with concurrent cisplatin 80-100 mg per square metre of body surface area on Days 1, 22 and 43 of the course of radiotherapy (n = 40). Acute mucosal reactions were scored using the modified Dische system., RESULTS: 15 (17.9%) patients, including 5 patients in p-CAIR and 10 patients in p-RTCT, did not comply with the assigned radiation treatment, mostly because of rapid tumour progression or deteriorating general performance. In p-RTCT, 22 (55%) patients received less than the intended three courses of chemotherapy mostly owing to haematological toxicity. The average maximum mucosal severity score was 14.2 in p-CAIR compared with 13.4 in p-RTCT; the difference was not statistically significant (p = 0.31)., CONCLUSION: The schedules compared (p-CAIR and p-RTCT) did not differ considerably with respect to acute mucosal reactions. Haematological toxicity in p-RTCT was elevated compared with p-CAIR.

Objective: Refractory functional pituitary adenomas are often treated with single-session stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) or conventionally fractionated intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT). While single-fraction SRS offers convenience and short time to biochemical remission, large tumors with cranial nerve or chiasmatic involvement often preclude single-fraction SRS, and toxicity may be worse following single-fraction SRS compared with IMRT. The purpose of our study was to explore the long-term outcomes of a unique hypofractionated stereotactic radiotherapy (HSRT) regimen delivered in 2-5 fractions. Method(s): After approval, we studied 16 consecutive patients treated with HSRT for refractory functional pituitary adenoma. Study endpoints included local control, biochemical control, and toxicity. Descriptive statistics summarized endpoints and clinicopathologic factors. Result(s): Sixteen patients with adrenocorticotropic hormone secretion (n = 9, 56%), growth hormone secretion (n = 4, 25%), and prolactin secretion (n = 3, 19%) were studied with a median follow-up time after HSRT of 10 years (IQR 2-14 years). Patients were treated with two (n = 8), three (n = 1), or five (n = 7) fractions to median dose of 20.5 Gy (range 16-32 Gy). HSRT was well-tolerated with no acute side effects greater than CTCAE grade 1. Local control was 100%, and biochemical control at last follow-up was 58%. Over 142 years patient-years, no instances of optic neuropathy, secondary malignancy, malignant transformation, radionecrosis, cavernous sinus cranial neuropathy, or cerebrovascular complications were noted. Conclusion(s): HSRT for refractory pituitary adenoma is well-tolerated with long-term local and biochemical control comparable with single-fraction SRS or IMRT. Prospective studies should evaluate whether HSRT provides non-inferior biochemical control and improved toxicity compared with single-fraction SRS.Copyright © 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.",Excluded
3249,"Decreasing radiation doses in digital subtraction angiographies consecutively performed by trainees. Digital subtraction angiography (DSA) performed by trainees may be related to increased radiation exposure. This study was aimed to investigate and quantify this learning effect, with fluoroscopy time and dose-area product (DAP) as parameters. We collected procedure data of the first to the fortieth cerebral DSA consecutively performed by 13 trainees in a training centre. DAP, procedure time, fluoroscopy time, number of cine-frames of the first 20 DSA procedures performed by these trainees were compared with that of the second 20 procedures. There was no significant difference concerning the procedure time between the first and the second 20 procedures (56.3 +/- 29.5 vs 51.5 +/- 20.2 min, p = 0.113). Numbers of cine-frames were very similar between the first and the second 20 procedures (750.7 +/- 290.3 vs 744.5 +/- 188.7, p = 0.830). Fluoroscopy time of the first 20 procedures was significantly longer than that of the second 20 procedures (17.8 +/- 15.4 vs 12.6 +/- 9.0, p = 0.001). DAP of the first 20 procedures was significantly higher than that of the second 20 procedures (6.4 +/- 4.9 vs 3.8 +/- 1.8, p < 0.001). DAP was correlated significantly with the performer's experience (R = -0.288, p < 0.001). There exists a learning effect of radiation exposure during cerebral DSA procedures performed by trainees. The learning effect is significant during the first 20 procedures, and becomes insignificant after 20 procedures. Insufficient catheter skills in novice trainees may be one reason for this effect.",Excluded

AIM: To assess the value of a single-phase dual-energy computed tomography (DECT) urography protocol with synchronous nephrographic-excretory phase enhancement and to calculate the potential dose reduction by omitting the unenhanced scan., MATERIALS AND METHODS: Eighty-four patients referred for haematuria underwent CT urography using a protocol that included single-energy unenhanced and dual-energy contrast-enhanced with synchronous nephrographic-excretory phase scans. DECT-based images [virtual unenhanced (VUE), weighted average, and colour-coded iodine overlay] were reconstructed. Opacification degree by contrast media of the upper urinary tract, and image quality of virtual unenhanced images were independently evaluated using a four-point scale. The diagnostic accuracy in detecting urothelial tumours on DECT-based images was determined. The dose of a theoretical dual-phase single-energy protocol was obtained by multiplying the effective dose of the unenhanced single-energy acquisition by two. Radiation dose saving by omitting the unenhanced scan was calculated., RESULTS: The degree of opacification was scored as optimal or good in 86.9% of cases (k = 0.72); VUE image quality was excellent or good in 83.3% of cases (k = 0.82). Sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value for urothelial tumours detection were 85.7, 98.6, 92.3, and 97.1%. Omission of the unenhanced scan led to a mean dose reduction of 42.7 +/- 5%., CONCLUSION: Single-phase DECT urography with synchronous nephrographic-excretory phase enhancement represents an accurate ""all-in-one'' approach with a radiation dose saving up to 45% compared with a standard dual-phase protocol.

2771,"Randomized controlled trial of dietary fiber for the prevention of radiation-induced gastrointestinal toxicity during pelvic radiotherapy. Background: Therapeutic radiotherapy is an important treatment of pelvic cancers. Historically, low-fiber diets have been recommended despite a lack of evidence and potentially beneficial mechanisms of fiber. Objective(s): This randomized controlled trial compared low-, habitual-, and high-fiber diets for the prevention of gastrointestinal toxicity in patients undergoing pelvic radiotherapy. Design(s): Patients were randomly assigned to low-fiber [<=10 g nonstarch polysaccharide (NSP)/d], habitual-fiber (control), or high-fiber (>=18 g NSP/d) diets and received individualized counseling at the start of radiotherapy to achieve these targets. The primary endpoint was the difference between groups in the change in the Inflammatory Bowel Disease Questionnaire- Bowel Subset (IBDQ-B) score between the starting and nadir (worst) score during treatment. Other measures included macronutrient intake, stool diaries, and fecal short-chain fatty acid concentrations. Result(s): Patients were randomly assigned to low-fiber (n = 55), habitual-fiber (n = 55), or high-fiber (n = 56) dietary advice. Fiber intakes were significantly different between groups (P < 0.001). The difference between groups in the change in IBDQ-B scores between the start and nadir was not significant (P = 0.093). However, the change in score between the start and end of radiotherapy was smaller in the high-fiber group (mean +/- SD: -3.7 +/- 12.8) than in the habitual-fiber group (-10.8 +/- 13.5; P = 0.011). At 1-y postradiotherapy (n = 126) the difference in IBDQ-B scores between the high-fiber (+0.1 +/- 14.5) and the habitualfiber (-8.4 +/- 13.3) groups was significant (P = 0.004). No significant differences were observed in stool frequency or form or in short-chain fatty acid concentrations. Significant reductions in energy, protein, and fat intake occurred in the low- and habitualfiber groups only. Conclusion(s): Dietary advice to follow a high-fiber diet during pelvic radiotherapy resulted in reduced gastrointestinal toxicity both acutely and at 1 y compared with habitual-fiber intake. Restrictive, non-evidence-based advice to reduce fiber intake in this setting should be abandoned.Copyright © 2017 American Society for Nutrition.",Excluded

Concurrent chemoradiotherapy (CHRT) is the standard of care for unresectable locally advanced stage III non-small cell lung cancer. However, the optimal combination remains unclear. The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of 2 induction chemotherapy cycles (days 1 and 22) with docetaxel 75 mg/m2 and cisplatin 75 mg/m2 followed by concurrent chemotherapy (weekly docetaxel-cisplatin, 20 mg/m2) and 3-D conformal radiotherapy for 6 weeks (66 Gy/5 fractions per week/2 Gy per fraction). The primary endpoint was the response rate. Secondary objectives were toxicity, time to progression, and overall survival. Forty-four patients were included and 40 were eligible. The mean age was 60.5 years (range 40.7-72.1), and 75% had stage IIIB disease. Six patients underwent complete R0 resection including 2 pathologic complete responses after a planned intermediate evaluation. Thirty-three patients completed CHRT. The objective response rate was 65% (95% CI 50.2-79.8). Grade 3-4 hematologic and digestive toxicities were observed mainly during the induction phase. Grade 3 esophagitis (5%) was experienced during CHRT. With a median follow-up of 38.7 months, the median progression-free survival was 28.3 months (95% CI 11.0-35.0) and the median survival rate was 31.4 months. Cisplatin-docetaxel induction followed by concurrent 3-D conformal radiotherapy and weekly chemotherapy is a feasible protocol associated with a promising response rate and acceptable toxicity.

1780,"Influence of data processing on cyclic variation of integrated backscatter and wall thickness in stunned porcine myocardium. This study was performed to investigate the relationship between the cyclic variation of integrated backscatter and myocardial wall thickening in stunned myocardium. Different definitions of cyclic variation were evaluated to be able to compare with other studies. Ultrasound data were acquired from 10 open-chested Yorkshire pigs (25-33 kg) at baseline, during regional ischemia and during 30 min of stunning, using a broadband ultrasound transducer (3-7 MHz) sutured directly upon the left ventricular myocardial wall. Cyclic variation of integrated backscatter and myocardial wall thickening were calculated using three definitions obtained from the literature. Independent of the definition, cyclic variation of wall thickness and integrated backscatter were blunted during acute ischemia and returned transiently to or above baseline during the first minute of reperfusion, followed by a gradual decrease to a level under baseline during stunning. An early return of the cyclic variation of the integrated backscatter was not observed in pigs, independent of the data processing used.

1640,"Complete pathological responses in locally advanced rectal cancer after preoperative IMRT and integrated-boost chemoradiation. Background and purpose: To analyze the efficacy and safety of a new preoperative intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) and integrated-boost chemoradiation scheme. Patients and Methods: In all, 74 patients were treated with IMRT and concurrent standard dose capecitabine. The dose of the planning target volume (PTV) encompassing the tumor, mesorectum, and pelvic lymph nodes was 46 Gy in 23 fractions; the boost PTV, at a dose of 57.5 Gy in 23 fractions, included the macroscopic primary tumor and pathological lymph nodes. The patients underwent surgery 6-8 weeks after chemoradiation. Result(s): The complete treatment data of 72 patients were analyzed. Tumor downstaging was achieved in 55 patients (76.38%) and node downstaging in 34 (47.2%). In 22 patients (30.6%), there was complete pathological response (ypCR). The circumferential resection margin was free of tumor in 70 patients (97.2%). The 3-year estimated overall survival and disease-free survival rates were 95.4 and 85.9% respectively, and no local relapse was found; however, ten patients (13.8%) developed distant metastases. High pathologic tumor (pT) downstaging was shown as a favorable prognostic factor for disease-free survival. No grade 4 acute radiotherapy-related toxicity was found. Conclusion(s): The IMRT and integrated-boost chemoradiation scheme offered higher rates of ypCR and pT downstaging, without a significant increase in toxicity. The circumferential margins were free of tumors in the majority of patients. Primary tumor regression was associated with better disease-free survival. © 2014 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.",Excluded

692,"Molecular basis of basal cell carcinogenesis in the atomic-bomb survivor population: p53 and PTCH gene alterations. Epidemiological studies suggest that UV exposure from sunlight is the major etiology for skin cancers, both melanocytic and non-melanocytic. However, the radiation-related risk for skin cancer among atomic bomb survivors of Hiroshima and Nagasaki is primarily derived from the excess risk of basal cell carcinoma (BCC), with no demonstrable excess in squamous cell carcinoma or melanoma. The BCCs in this cohort are therefore unusual in being potentially attributable to two types of radiation - UV and ionizing (IR). BCCs have been associated with PTCH and/or p53 tumor suppressor gene alterations. To investigate the roles of these genes in relation to IR and UV exposures, we analyzed both genes in BCC samples from atomic bomb survivors. We examined 47 tumors, of which 70% had non-silent base-substitution p53 mutations independent of IR or UV exposure. However, the distribution of mutation type depends on UV and/or IR exposure. For example, C-to-T transitions at CpG sites adjacent to pyrimidine-pyrimidine (PyPy) sequences were more prevalent in tumors from UV-exposed than UV-shielded body areas and CpG-mutations at non-PyPy sequences were more prevalent in tumors from UV-shielded body areas with high-IR (>=1 Gy) than low-IR (<0.2 Gy) exposure. And notably, although p53 deletion-frequencies demonstrated no IR-dose associations, deletions at the PTCH locus were more frequent (79% versus 44%) in tumors with high-IR than low-IR exposure. Moreover, 60% of high-IR tumors harbored both p53 and PTCH abnormalities compared with 23% of low-IR tumors. Therefore, alteration of both genes is likely to play a role in radiation-induced basal cell carcinogenesis. © 2006 Oxford University Press.",Excluded

Thirty-seven, (60.6%) had less than 10 years of experience in the laboratory. Only 28 (45.9%) had undertaken radiation protection training. Fifty-eight, (95.1%) consistently used lead aprons. Forty-seven, (77%) reported consistently using thyroid shields. Ten (16.4%) consistently used radiation protection eyeglasses, whilst 36 (59%) never used them. Thermoluminescent Dosimeter badges were consistently used in 23 (37.7%). Forty-two, (68.9%) reported having ceiling mounted lead/acrylic shields.

Clinical data on toxicities using volumetric modulated arc therapy (VMAT) in lung cancer remain scarce. We aimed to report both acute (APT) and late (LPT) pulmonary and acute (AET) and late (LET) oesophageal toxicities in such setting. Method(s): All patients treated for a primary lung cancer with VMAT chemotherapy (ChT) in our center from 2014 to 2018 were retrospectively included. Usual clinical, treatment and dosimetric features were collected. Univariate analysis was performed using the receiver operative characteristics approach while multivariate analysis (MVA) relied on logistic regression, calculated with Medcalc 14.8.1. Result(s): In total, 167 patients were included, with a median age of 66 years (39-88 years). Median radiation dose was 66 Gy (30-66 Gy); 82% patients received concomitant (32.3%), induction (25.7%) or induction followed by concomitant ChT (24%).

PURPOSE: Treatment of locally advanced rectal cancer (T3-T4 or N+) is based on short-course radiotherapy (RT) or chemoradiotherapy (CRT) followed by surgery. It is estimated that 30-40 % of rectal cancer occurs in patients aged 75 years or more. Data on adherence to neoadjuvant CRT and its safety remain poor owing to the under-representation of older patients in randomized clinical trials and the discordance in the results from retrospective studies. The aim of this study was to assess adherence with preoperative CRT and tolerability in older patients with a stage II/III unresectable rectal cancer., METHODS: Patients aged 75 years or more with stage II/III rectal cancer treated with preoperative CRT at the University Hospital of Besancon from 1993 to 2011 were included. Feasibility, toxicities, overall survival, and local recurrence rates were studied., RESULTS: Fifty-six patients with a Charlson score from 2 to 6 were included. The mean age was 78 years.

A total of 80 patients with unresectable HCC treated in the First People's Hospital of Qinhuangdao from March 2009 to March 2015 were randomly divided into TACE group (n=40) and TACE + RT group (n=40). Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was used to detect the levels of p53 in both groups before and after treatment. The biochemical indexes of liver function [alpha-fetoprotein (AFP), alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and gamma-glutamyl transferase (GGT)] were detected. Moreover, adverse reactions were compared between the two groups of patients, the short-term therapeutic effect was evaluated, and effects of two treatment methods on progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) of patients were detected. There were no statistically significant differences in clinical data between the two groups of patients (P>0.05). The p53 protein levels were significantly downregulated in both treatment methods, and it was decreased more significantly in TACE + RT group than that in TACE group (P<0.05). Compared with those before treatment, AFP and GGT levels in both groups of patients after treatment were decreased, but the levels of ALT were increased (P<0.05), and TACE + RT group had a better curative effect than TACE group (P<0.05). Besides, the incidence rate of adverse reactions in TACE + RT group (37.5%) was obviously lower than that in TACE group (65%) (P<0.05).

The aim of this study was to evaluate local control (LC) and the risk of vertebral compression fracture (VCF) after stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) in patients with renal cell cancer spinal metastases. Methods. Prospectively collected data on 71 spinal segments treated with SBRT in 37 patients were reviewed. The median follow-up was 12.3 months (range 1.2-55.4 months). The LC rate was assessed based on each spinal segment treated and overall survival (OS) according to each patient treated. Sixty of 71 segments (85%) were radiation naive, 11 of 71 (15%) were previously irradiated, and 10 of 71 (14%) were treated with postoperative SBRT. The median SBRT total dose and number of fractions were 24 Gy and 2, respectively. The VCF analysis also included evaluation of the Spinal Instability Neoplastic Score criteria. Results. The 1-year OS and LC rates were 64% and 83%, respectively. Multivariate analysis identified oligometastatic disease (13 of 37 patients) as a positive prognostic factor (p = 0.018) for OS. Of 61 non-postoperative spinal segments treated, 10 (16%) developed VCFs; 3 of 10 were de novo VCFs and 7 of 10 occurred as progression of an existing VCF. The 1-year VCF-free probability rate was 82%. Multivariate analysis identified single-fraction SBRT and baseline VCF as significant predictors of SBRT-induced VCF (p = 0.028 and p = 0.012, respectively). Conclusions. Spine SBRT yields high rates of local tumor control in patients with renal cell cancer. Baseline VCF and 18-24 Gy delivered in a single fraction were predictive of further collapse. Patients with oligometastatic disease may benefit most from such aggressive local therapy, given the prolonged survival observed.Copyright © AANS, 2014.",Excluded

The aim of this study was to assess the long-term outcome and toxicity of treatment with 11.1 GBq (300 mCi) of (131)I-MIBG per cycle., METHODS: We performed a retrospective review of 31 patients with advanced metastatic neuroendocrine tumors (20 with carcinoid tumors and 11 with other tumors) treated with (131)I-MIBG. Treatment outcome was analyzed for patients with carcinoid tumors (the most common tumors in this study), and toxicity was analyzed for the entire patient cohort (n = 31). Treatment comprised 11.1 GBq (300 mCi) per course and minimum intervals of 3 mo. The radiographic response was classified according to modified Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors. Toxicity was determined according to Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (version 3.0) for all laboratory data at regular follow-up visits and during outpatient care, including complete blood counts and hepatic and renal function tests. Survival analysis was performed with the Kaplan-Meier curve method (log rank test; P < 0.05)., RESULTS: The radiographic responses in patients with carcinoid tumors comprised a minor response in 2 patients (10%), stable disease in 16 patients (80%; median time to progression, 34 mo), and progressive disease in 2 patients (10%). The symptomatic responses in patients with functioning carcinoid tumors comprised complete resolution in 3 of the 11 evaluable symptomatic patients (27%), partial resolution in 6 patients (55%), and no significant change in 11 patients. The median overall survival in patients with carcinoid tumors was 47 mo (95% confidence interval, 32-62), and the median progression-free survival was 34 mo (95% confidence interval, 13-55).

The most frequent nonhematologic side effect was mild nausea (grade 1 or 2), which was observed in 28% of administered cycles. No hepatic or renal toxicities were noted., CONCLUSION: Dose-intensified treatment with (131)I-MIBG at a fixed dose of 11.1 GBq (300 mCi) per cycle is safe and offers effective palliation of symptoms and disease stabilization in patients with advanced carcinoid tumors. The favorable survival and limited toxicity suggest that high cycle activities are suitable and that this modality may be used for targeted carcinoid treatment--either as an alternative or as an adjunct to other existing therapeutic options.",Excluded
1530,"Deregulated levels of the NF-kappaB1, NF-kappaB2, and rel genes in ukrainian patients with leukemia and lymphoma in the post-chernobyl period. Objective: Nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kappaB) is an important transcription factor in cancer and NF-kappaB activation has been seen in angiogenesis, tumor progression, and metastasis. Relationships between specific NF-kappaB gene networks, leukemogenesis, and radiation exposure are still unknown. Our aim was to study the expression levels of the NF-kappaB1, NF-kappaB2, and Rel genes in hematological malignancies in the post-Chernobyl period. Material(s) and Method(s): We analyzed gene expression levels of NFkappaB1, NF-kappaB2, and Rel in 49 B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia, 8 B-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, 3 acute myeloid leukemia, 3 chronic myeloid leukemia, 2 hairy cell leukemia, 2 myelodysplastic syndrome, and 2 T-cell large granular lymphocytic leukemia patients using realtime polymerase chain reaction. Result(s): Expression levels of NF-kappaB1, NF-kappaB2, and Rel genes were found to be deregulated. Conclusion(s): These results could be accepted as specific gene traces to radiation-induced leukemia or as potential candidates for new diagnostic biomarker studies. Larger experiments and non-exposed control malignant cell populations are needed to clarify these suggestions.Copyright © 2016, Turkish Society of Hematology. All right reserved.",Excluded

PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to compare magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) of three different regions of the human brain between 3 and 7 Tesla, using the same subjects and closely matched methodology at both field strengths., METHODS: A semi-LASER (sLASER) pulse sequence with TE 32ms was used to acquire metabolite spectrum along with the water reference at 3T and 7T using similar experimental parameters and hardware at both field strengths (n=4 per region and field). Spectra were analyzed in LCModel using a simulated basis set., RESULTS: Signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) at 7T was higher compared to 3T, and linewidths (in ppm) at both field strengths were comparable in ppm scale. Of the 13 metabolites reported in the paper, most metabolites were measured with higher precision at 7T in all three regions., CONCLUSION: The study confirms gains in SNR and measurement precision at 7T in all three representative brain regions using the sLASER pulse sequence coupled with a 32-channel phased-array head coil.

3239,"A cross-sectional case control study on genetic damage in individuals residing in the vicinity of a mobile phone base station. Mobile phone base stations facilitate good communication, but the continuously emitting radiations from these stations have raised health concerns. Hence in this study, genetic damage using the single cell gel electrophoresis (comet) assay was assessed in peripheral blood leukocytes of individuals residing in the vicinity of a mobile phone base station and comparing it to that in healthy controls. The power density in the area within 300 m from the base station exceeded the permissive limits and was significantly (p = 0.000) higher compared to the area from where control samples were collected. The study participants comprised 63 persons with residences near a mobile phone tower, and 28 healthy controls matched for gender, age, alcohol drinking and occupational sub-groups. Genetic damage parameters of DNA migration length, damage frequency (DF) and damage index were significantly (p = 0.000) elevated in the sample group compared to respective values in healthy controls. The female residents (n = 25) of the sample group had significantly (p = 0.004) elevated DF than the male residents (n = 38). The linear regression analysis further revealed daily mobile phone usage, location of residence and power density as significant predictors of genetic damage. The genetic damage evident in the participants of this study needs to be addressed against future disease-risk, which in addition to neurodegenerative disorders, may lead to cancer.",Excluded
1044,"A matched-pair analysis of stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) for oligometastatic lung tumors from colorectal cancer versus early stage non-small cell lung cancer. Background: The use of stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) for early-stage primary non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) reported excellent local control rates. But the optimal SBRT dose for oligometastatic lung tumors (OLTs) from colorectal cancer (CRC) has not yet been determined. This study aimed to evaluate whether SBRT to a dose of 48-60 Gy in 4-5 fractions could result in similar local outcomes for OLTs from CRC as compared to early-stage NSCLC, and to examine potential dose-response relationships for OLTs from CRC. Method(s): OLTs from CRC and primary NSCLCs treated with SBRT to 48-60 Gy in 4-5 fractions at a single institution were evaluated, and a matched-pair analysis was performed. Local recurrence-free survival (LRFS) was estimated by the Kaplan-Meier method. Univariate Cox regression was performed to identify significant predictors. Result(s): There were 72 lung lesions in 61 patients (24 OLTs from CRC in 15 patients and 48 NSCLCs in 46 patients) were analyzed with a median follow-up of 30 months. LRFS for OLTs from CRC was significantly worse than that of NSCLC when treated with 48-60 Gy/4-5 fx (p = 0.006). The 1, 3 and 5-year LRFS of OLTs from CRC vs NSCLC were 80.6% vs. 100%, 68.6% vs. 97.2%, and 68.6% vs. 81.0%, respectively. On univariate analysis, OLTs from CRC treated with higher dose (BED10 = 132 Gy) exhibited significantly better local recurrence-free survival than those treated to lower doses (BED10 <= 105.6 Gy) (p = 0.0022). The 1 and 3-year LRFS rates for OLTs treated to a higher dose (BED10 = 132 Gy) were 88.9% and 81.5%, vs 33.3%, and not achieved for lower doses (BED10 <= 105.6 Gy). Conclusion(s): The LRFS of OLTs from CRC after SBRT of 48-60 Gy/4-5 fx was significantly worse than that of primary NSCLC. Lower dose SBRT appeared to have inferior control for OLTs of CRC in this cohort. Further studies with larger sample sizes are needed.Copyright © 2018 The Author(s).",Excluded
632,"Impact of gamma radiation dose on sterility and quality parameters of Anastrepha fraterculus (Diptera: Tephritidae). Anastrepha fraterculus (Wiedemann, 1830) (Diptera: Tephritidae) is a major fruit pest, which is basicaly controlled using insecticides, which represents a risk to beneficial arthropods, human health and food contamination. The sterile insect technique (SIT) is a potential alternative tool for the management of this pest, however, only conflicting data is found regarding the optimal dose to achieve sterility. Thus, this study evaluated the effect of gamma radiation doses (0, 40, 50, 60 and 70 Gy) on male and female reproductive sterility, gonads morphometry, emergence, flight ability, and longevity under nutritional stress of A. fraterculus. Full female sterility was achieved at 50 Gy, while full male sterility was achieved at 70 Gy. Both ovarian and testicular sizes were affected by irradiation, while no influence was observed on the quality parameters evaluated. Our results suggest that 70 Gy applied 48 h before adult emergence can be used to sterilize A. fraterculus in a SIT programme.",Excluded
3280,"Mandibulotomy: an analysis of its morbidities. The mandibulotomy is a procedure that was developed to improve access in tumour resection. This study aimed to investigate the complications associated with mandibulotomy and analyze factors that could affect the risks of developing these complications. The hospital records of all patients who underwent a mandibulotomy as part of their tumour ablative surgery at two major centres in Malaysia were reviewed retrospectively. Demographic, clinical, and complications data were recorded and analyzed. Early postoperative complications occurred in 46.5% of the patients and post-radiation therapy complications in 16.1%. Wound dehiscence (27.9%) and inferior alveolar nerve injury (25.6%) were the common early postoperative complications. Dental injuries (9.7%) and plate exposure/infection (9.7%) were the common post-radiation therapy complications. Furthermore, inferior alveolar nerve injury and early abscess formation were significantly associated with the site of the mandibulotomy. The T-stage of a tumour but not the site of mandibulotomy was significantly associated with tumour margin clearance. Mandibulotomy does pose an added risk of complications for a patient undergoing tumour surgery. The benefits of mandibulotomy in terms of gaining margin clearance could not be proven in this study. The site of mandibulotomy appears to increase the risk of developing an inferior alveolar nerve injury.Copyright © 2019",Excluded
3354,"Anatomic and procedural determinants of fluoroscopy time during elective endovascular aortic aneurysm repair. Objective: To identify both the procedural and anatomic factors which determine duration of fluoroscopy during elective endovascular aortic aneurysm repair (EVAR). Method(s): We retrospectively analyzed our prospectively maintained EVAR database for the relationship between fluoroscopy time and both procedural (type of graft, configuration, number of components, surgeon) and anatomic factors reflective of aneurysm complexity (15 variables). Result(s): A total of 128 patients underwent elective EVAR with a mean fluoroscopy time of 5.7 +/- 3.4 min. The type of grafts used consisted of 41 (32%) Zenith, 85 (66.4%) Endurant and 2 (1.6%) Anaconda, with 105 (82%) being bifurcated and 23 (18%) being aorto-uni-iliac (AUI) in configuration. Both the surgeon performing the procedure (p = 0.001) and graft configuration (bifurcated vs. AUI, p = 0.03) were found to be predictive of fluoroscopy time; while procedural and anatomic variables were not. Conclusion(s): The surgeon's efficiency in the use of fluoroscopy during EVAR is the most important determinant of total fluoroscopy time. Anatomic complexity, make of device, and number of components inserted have minimal impact on duration of fluoroscopy. An endovascular surgeon's ability to curtail fluoroscopy duration is the key component in minimizing radiation exposure to both the surgical team and the patient.Copyright © 2015, The Author(s) 2015.",Excluded

PURPOSE: To compare the feasibility and safety of proximal cerebral protection to a distal filter during carotid artery stenting (CAS) via a transbrachial (TB) or transradial (TR) approach., METHODS: Among 856 patients who underwent CAS between January 2007 and July 2015, 214 (25%) patients (mean age 72+/-8 years; 154 men) had the procedure via a TR (n=154) or TB (n=60) approach with either Mo.MA proximal protection (n=61) or distal filter protection (n=153). The Mo.MA group (mean age 73+/-7 years; 54 men) had significantly more men and more severe stenosis than the filter group (mean age 71+/-8 years; 100 men). Stent type and CAS technique were left to operator discretion. Heparin and a dedicated closure device or bivalirudin and manual compression were used in TR and TB accesses, respectively. Technical and procedure success, crossover to femoral artery, 30-day major adverse cardiovascular/cerebrovascular events (MACCE; death, all strokes, and myocardial infarction), vascular complications, and radiation exposure were compared between groups., RESULTS: Crossover to a femoral approach was required in 1/61 (1.6%) Mo.MA patient vs 11/153 (7.1%) filter patients mainly due to technical difficulty in engaging the target vessel. Five Mo.MA patients developed acute intolerance to proximal occlusion; 4 were successfully shifted to filter protection. A TR patient was shifted to filter because the Mo.MA system was too short. CAS was technically successful in the remaining 55 (90%) Mo.MA patients and 142 (93%) filter patients. The MACCE rate was 0% in the Mo.MA patients and 2.8% in the filter group (p=0.18). Radiation exposure was similar between groups. Major vascular complications occurred in 1/61 (1.6%) and in 3/153 (1.96%) patients in the Mo.MA and filter groups (p=0.18), respectively, and were confined to the TB approach in the early part of the learning curve. Chronic radial artery occlusion was detected by Doppler ultrasound in 2/30 (6.6%) Mo.MA patients and in 4/124 (3.2%) filter patients by clinical assessment (p=0.25) at 8.1+/-7.5-month follow-up., CONCLUSION: CAS with proximal protection via a TR or TB approach is a feasible, safe, and effective technique with a low rate of vascular complications.

2158,"Phosphorylation of Ser312 contributes to tumor suppression by p53 in vivo. The tumor suppressor p53 is a master sensor of stress, and posttranslational modifications are key in controlling its stability and transcriptional activities. p53 can be phosphorylated on at least 23 Ser/Thr residues, the majority of which are phosphorylated by stress-related kinases. An exception is Ser315 in human p53 (Ser312 in mouse), which is predominantly phosphorylated by cell cyclerelated kinases. To understand the biological importance of Ser312 phosphorylation in vivo, wegenerated p53Ser312Ala knock-in mice. We show here that, although Ser312 is not essential for mouse life span under normal physiological conditions, Ser312Ala mutation dampens p53's activity during embryonic development. This is evident from its partial rescue of embryonic lethality caused by Mdm4 deletion. In agreement with the notion that Ser312 mutation weakens p53 function, Ser312Ala mice are alsomore susceptible to tumorigenesis following a sublethal ionizing radiation dose. Importantly, in the cohort studied, Ser312 mutation predisposes mice to develop thymic lymphomas and liver tumors, partly due to p53Ser312Ala's inability to fully induce a set of p53 target genes including p21 and cyclin G1. Thus, we demonstrate that phosphorylation of Ser312 is required for p53 to function fully as a tumor suppressor in vivo.",Excluded
2849,"Clinical and Spectrophotometric Evaluation of Skin Photoadaptation in Vitiligo Patients after a Short Cycle of NB-UVB Phototherapy. BACKGROUND: The phenomenon of photoadaptation to narrow-band ultraviolet B (NB-UVB) radiation has been previously described in vitiligo and has usually been clinically measured by the assessment of the minimal erythema dose (MED) after phototesting., OBJECTIVES: To assess the photoadaptive response in vitiligo and healthy skin after NB-UVB phototherapy not only clinically, but also by spectrophotometry., MATERIALS AND METHODS: Fourteen patients affected by generalized vitiligo underwent NB-UVB phototherapy twice weekly for 12 weeks. Before and after phototherapy, a phototesting procedure was administered on vitiligo patches and adjacent healthy skin with a solar simulated radiation (SSR). Visual assessment of the MED took place after 24 h. A spectrophotometer was used to assess the a* value and the melanin index (MI*), as signs of skin erythema and pigmentation. The photoadaptation factor (MED-PF) and the a* photoadaptation factor (a*-PF) were calculated., RESULTS: After NB-UVB phototherapy, both vitiligo and healthy skin showed an increase in MED and MI* values and a reduction of skin erythema compared to baseline (p < 0.05). MED-PF data showed a photoadaptation in 10 (71.4%) vitiligo lesions and in 12 (85.7%) healthy skin areas. The assessment of the a*-PF showed a negative mean percentage value in all affected and unaffected skin areas., CONCLUSIONS: A short cycle of NB-UVB phototherapy can induce photoadaptation in vitiligo by increasing the MED and reducing skin erythema after stimulation with SSR. This is most likely due to the physical filter function induced by ultraviolet radiation. Copyright © 2019 S. Karger AG, Basel.",Excluded

Purpose/Objective(S):: We report our experience using hypofractionated radiotherapy in older patients. MATERIALS/Methods: This analysis includes patients aged 60 years and older at our institution with inoperable Stage I (T1/T2 N0 M0) non-small-cell lung cancer that completed a curative course of radiotherapy alone using a hypofractionated schedule. Between 1991 and 2006, 75 such patients were identified with median age of 74 years (range, 60-86). Patient characteristics were as follows: male, 65/75 (86.7%); stage IA (T1N0), 47/75 (62.7%); stage IB (T2N0), 28/75 (37.3%). Patients received a median total dose of 6500 cGy using median daily dose fractions of 250 cGy. The following outcomes were analyzed: local failure free survival (time to local failure or death from any cause), time to distal failure as first event, and overall survival. Toxicities were evaluated using Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events v 3.0. Result(s): The median follow-up was 19.6 months (range: 4.0-128.8 months). Median local failure free survival was 19.6 months (95% confidence interval [CI]: 14.4-28.8 months); and median overall survival was 21.2 months (95% CI: 14.9-29.3 months). Analysis of competing risks showed that at 5 years, the probability of local failure as the first detected event was 22.1% (95% CI: 12.8%-32.9%); the probability of distal failure as the first detected event was 14.5% (95% CI: 7.3%-24.0%); and the probability of death without recording a failure was 48.6% (95% CI: 36.1%-60.1%). Radiation-related toxicity of grade 3 or greater was seen in 3 patients and there were no treatment-related deaths.

Objective: To assess the yield of non-contrast enhanced CT (CT KUB) across different ordering specialties and need of developing an algorithm for its rationale use. Material(s) and Method(s): We retrospectively reviewed 1550 consecutive CT KUB studies requested for suspected renal colic carried out at a single institution in a calendar year. The data was analyzed for demographic characteristics, referring clinician and final diagnosis. Only patients with CT as primary imaging for clinically suspected reno-ureteral colic were included. Departments ordering these CT KUB examinations were divided into three divisions: Urologist, emergency room (ER) physician and others. Result(s): Of 1550 CT KUB performed in the study period 766 met the inclusion criteria. Urologists (57%), followed by ER physicians (30%) mostly ordered the examination. The overall positive yield for urolithiasis was 64% (n = 490), rate of incidental/alternate findings was 15% (n = 116) and 21% (n = 160) were negative. Urologist has the highest positive yield of 67.4% (n = 295) followed by ER physician 67% (n = 152) and others 42.5% (n = 43); p < 0.001.

3424,"Reduced-dose fractionated stereotactic radiotherapy for acoustic neuromas: Maintenance of tumor control with improved hearing preservation. Background: Fractionated stereotactic radiotherapy (FSRT) is a noninvasive treatment for acoustic neuromas (ANs). Initial reports from our institution demonstrated that the reduction of treatment dose to 46.8 Gy resulted in improved preservation of functional hearing status. Objective(s): We now report the tumor control (TC), symptomatic outcome, and hearing preservation (HP) rate in patients treated with reduced-dose FSRT. Method(s): We analyzed all patients with AN treated from 2002 to 2011. All patients received 46.8 Gy in 1.8-Gy fractions. Follow-up audiogram and magnetic resonance imaging were performed in <=1-year intervals. TC and HP were calculated by the Kaplan-Meier method. Analysis of HP, defined as Gardner-Robertson value <=2, was determined by audiometric data. Non-hearing-related symptoms were defined by Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events version 4. Result(s): In total, 154 patients were analyzed. At a median follow-up of 35 months (range, 4-108), TC was achieved in 96% of patients (n = 148/154) and at 3 and 5 years was 99% and 93%. Eighty-seven patients had serviceable hearing at the time of FSRT and evaluable audiometric follow-up. Overall HP was 67% and at 3 and 5 years was 66% and 54%. Pure tone average decreased by a median of 13 dB in all patients. Nineteen percent (n = 31) of patients experienced symptom improvement, and 8% (n = 13) had worsening of symptoms. Cranial nerve dysfunction occurred in 3.8% of patients (n = 6). Conclusion(s): Reduced-dose FSRT to 46.8 Gy for AN achieves excellent functional HP rates and limited toxicity without compromising long-term TC. Based on these promising outcomes, further attempts at dose deescalation may be warranted. © 2013 by the Congress of Neurological Surgeons.",Excluded
1754,"The diagnosis of acute urethral trauma. Background: During trauma resuscitation, blind catheterization of an injured urethra may aggravate the injury by disrupting a partially torn urethra. In busy trauma centers, retrograde urethrograms (RUG) prior to catheterisation for all patients with unstable pelvic fractures presents a challenge during trauma resuscitation, and the procedure is not commonly practiced despite Advanced Trauma Life Support (ATLS) and World Health Organisation recommendations. The aim of this study was to determine the presenting clinical features of patients with urethral injuries and to predict major trauma patients needing further investigation to exclude this injury. Method(s): A retrospective review of adult major trauma patients diagnosed with urethral injuries during an 8-year period at a major trauma centre, was conducted. Result(s): There were 998 major trauma patients with fractures of the pelvis over the study period, of whom 223 had pubic symphysis disruption. There were 29 patients with urethral injuries. The sensitivity of any one of the traditional signs of urethral trauma was 66.7% (95% CI: 46.0-82.8). After exclusion of patients with penetrating trauma and iatrogenic injuries, pubic symphysis disruption on initial pelvis AP X-ray and/or the clinical signs of urethral injury had a sensitivity of 100% (95% CI: 84.4-100.0) for urethral trauma. Discussion(s): Reliance on clinical features alone to predict urethral injury results in a substantial proportion of missed injuries in major trauma patients. RUGs did not appear to be needed in patients with no disruption of the pubic symphysis on initial pelvis X-ray or where no signs of urethral injury are present. In the absence of clinical signs and pubic symphysis disruption, blind urethral catheterisation may be attempted. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.",Excluded
1546,"Indications of future decreasing trends in skin-melanoma mortality among whites in the United States. Trends in skin melanoma death rates during a 35-year period, 1950-84, were analyzed according to age, sex, and birth cohort for whites in the United States. In contrast to upward trends observed for older men and women (i.e., over 40), downward trends were noted for younger age groups. The risk of dying from skin melanoma appears to have peaked for male cohorts born during the 1950s and for female cohorts born during the 1930s. Assuming no future environmental or lifestyle changes, the upward trend in age-adjusted mortality rates, which averaged 2 to 3% per annum since 1950, is projected to discontinue and bend downward by the second decade of the 21st century. Skin melanoma incidence data, which was limited to a series of 12 years (1973-84) and inadequate for cohort analyses, were included to demonstrate that trends in age-specific rates were comparable with those observed for mortality during the overlapping time period. Incidence trends according to anatomical site are also described. These results indicate that baseline data necessary for assessing the potential effects on this disease from future depletions of the ozone layer, and predicted increases of solar ultra-violet radiation exposure, would be improved with the inclusion of cohort data and age-specific trend analyses.",Excluded

Objective: Bone loss in patients with inflammatory back pain (IBP) suspicious of early undifferentiated spondyloarthropathy is poorly defined. The aim of this study was to examine changes in bone mineral density (BMD) at the hip, lumbar spine and hand in patients with early IBP and to look for possible biomarkers associated with this change. Method(s): In 30 patients with early IBP, clinical data were collected and BMD assessed using dual energy x-ray absorptiometry at baseline, 6 and 12 months. Further imaging performed included MRI of the sacroiliac joints (SIJs) and spine at baseline and x-rays of the SIJs at baseline and after 8 years. Result(s): After 12 months no significant reduction in hip, spine and hand BMD was seen at the group level. However, hip bone loss was found to be associated with raised baseline C-reactive protein levels, baseline MRI bone marrow oedema of the SIJs and the presence of radiographic sacroiliitis after 8 years. No association was found with change in spine and hand BMD. Conclusion(s): Systemic bone loss in the hip is an early feature of the inflammatory disease process in patients with IBP in undifferentiated spondyloarthropathy and is related to disease activity. These data highlight the importance of aggressive intervention in the early stages of disease in undifferentiated spondyloarthropathy.",Excluded
2353,"Abdominal aortic calcification on a plain X-ray and the relation with significant coronary artery disease in asymptomatic chronic dialysis patients. Background: Coronary artery disease (CAD) is common in asymptomatic chronic dialysis patients and plays an important role in their poor survival. Early identification of these high-risk patients could improve treatment and reduce mortality. Abdominal aortic calcification (AAC) has previously been associated with CAD in autopsy studies. Since the AAC can be quantified easily using a lateral lumbar X-ray we hypothesized that the extent of AAC as assessed on a lateral lumbar X-ray might be predictive of the presence of significant CAD in dialysis patients. Method(s): All patients currently enrolled in the ICD2 trial without a history of CABG or a PCI with stent implantation were included in this study. All patients underwent CT-angiography (CTA) and a lateral X-ray of the abdomen. AAC on X-ray was quantified using a previously validated scoring system whereupon the association between AAC and the presence of significant CAD was assessed. Result(s): A total of 90 patients were included in this study (71% male, 67 +/- 7 years old). Forty-six patients were found to have significant CAD. AAC-score was significantly higher in patients with CAD (10.1 +/- 4.9 vs 6.3 +/- 4.6 (p < 0.05). Multivariate regression analysis revealed that AAC score is an independent predictor for the presence of CAD with a 1,2 fold higher risk per point increase (p < 0.01). The AAC score has a sensitivity of 85% and a specificity of 57% for the presence of significant CAD. Conclusion(s): This study shows that abdominal aortic calcification as assessed on a lateral lumbar X-ray is predictive for the presence of significant coronary artery disease in asymptomatic dialysis patients. This simple, non-invasive and cheap screening method could contribute to early identification of patients eligible for further screening of CAD.Copyright © 2017 The Author(s).",Excluded

Conclusion(s): Combination of automated TVA and ADMIRE in neck CT using third-generation DSCT results in a substantial radiation dose reduction with low noise and increased CNR. Key Points: * Third-generation DSCT provides automated tube voltage adaptation with an increment of 10 kV. * 10 kV increment optimizes scans to the patient's neck anatomy. * TVA combined with ADMIRE significantly lower radiation dose in contrast-enhanced neck CT. * TVA in combination with ADMIRE reduces noise and increases SNR and CNR. * Image analysis quoted less noise and better diagnostic acceptability in third-generation DSCT.Copyright © 2015, European Society of Radiology.",Excluded
1393,"Forward-Projected Model-Based Iterative Reconstruction in Screening Low-Dose Chest CT: Comparison With Adaptive Iterative Dose Reduction 3D. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study is to compare forward-projected model-based iterative reconstruction solution (FIRST), a newer fully iterative CT reconstruction method, with adaptive iterative dose reduction 3D (AIDR 3D) in low-dose screening CT for lung cancer. Differences in image noise, image quality, and pulmonary nodule detection, size, and characterization were specifically evaluated., MATERIALS AND METHODS: Low-dose chest CT images obtained for 50 consecutive patients between December 2015 and January 2016 were retrospectively reviewed. Images were reconstructed using FIRST and AIDR 3D for both lung and soft-tissue reconstruction. Images were independently reviewed to assess image noise, subjective image quality (with use of a 5-point Likert scale, with 1 denoting far superior image quality; 2, superior quality; 3, equivalent quality; 4, inferior quality; and 5, far inferior quality), pulmonary nodule count, size of the largest pulmonary nodule, and characterization of the largest pulmonary nodule (i.e., solid, part solid, or ground glass)., RESULTS: Across all 50 cases, measured image noise was lower with FIRST than with AIDR 3D (lung window, 44% reduction, 41 +/- 7 vs 74 +/- 8 HU, respectively; soft-tissue window, 32% reduction, 11 +/- 2 vs 16 +/- 2 HU, respectively). Readers subjectively rated images obtained with FIRST as comparable to images obtained with AIDR 3D (mean [+/- SD] Likert score for FIRST vs AIDR 3D, 3.2 +/- 0.3 for soft-tissue reconstructions and 3.0 +/- 0.3 for lung reconstructions). For each reader, very good agreement regarding nodule count was noted between FIRST and AIDR 3D (interclass correlation coefficient [ICC], 0.83 for reader 1 and 0.78 for reader 2). Excellent agreement regarding nodule size (ICC, 0.99 for reader 1 and 0.99 for reader 2) and characterization of the largest nodule (kappa value, 0.92 for reader 1 and 0.82 for reader 2) also existed., CONCLUSION: Images reconstructed with FIRST are superior to those reconstructed AIDR 3D with regard to image noise and are equivalent with regard to subjective image quality, pulmonary nodule count, and nodule characterization.",Excluded

2546,"Evaluation and treatment results of trimodality therapy for advanced esophageal squamous cell carcinoma. Objectives: The prognosis for highly advanced esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) remains poor, and there is currently no standard treatment. The purpose of this study was to examine the benefits of trimodality therapy [chemoradiation plus surgery, (CRT + S)] by evaluating the surgical outcomes of patients with ESCC in Keiyukai Sapporo Hospital, Japan. We assessed the preoperative and postoperative adverse events, treatment effects of preoperative CRT, metastatic diagnosis of the dissected lymph nodes, and survival. Patients and Methods: Between 2012 and 2018, 148 patients with highly advanced ESCC who underwent preoperative CRT + S were analyzed for diagnosis and staging, preoperative complications, clinical and histopathological effects of CRT in the resected specimens, survival rates, and recurrences. Result(s): The grade 3 and higher complications of preoperative CRT were neutropenia in 3 cases and thrombocytopenia in 1 case. Among the postoperative complications, there were 2 cases (1.4%) of direct surgical death, only tracheobronchial bleeding and liver failure. Using the 11th edition of the classification of esophageal cancer by the Japanese Esophageal Society, 60 patients (40.5%) were classified as grade 3 (negative for cancer cells, pathological complete response). However, 20 of them (33.3%) had metastatic tumor cells in the lymph nodes. The overall 5-year survival rate was 58.5%. Including references to the pathological findings and recurrence patterns, there is no effective diagnostic method for selecting the subsequent approach based on the effectiveness of CRT. Conclusion(s): Planned surgery following CRT was the only solution for achieving better treatment results. CRT + S is a promising treatment with low direct surgical mortality.Copyright © 2020, The Japan Esophageal Society.",Excluded
555,"Effects of variable power on tissue ablation dynamics during magnetic resonance-guided laser-induced thermal therapy with the Visualase system. Purpose: Magnetic resonance-guided laser-induced thermal therapy (MRgLITT) is a minimally invasive procedure used to treat various intracranial pathologies. This study investigated the effects of variable power on maximal estimated thermal damage during ablation and duration required to reach maximal ablation. Materials/Methods: All ablations were performed using the Visualase Thermal Therapy System (Medtronic Inc., Minneapolis, Minnesota), which uses a 980 nm diffusing tip diode laser. Cases were stratified into low, medium and high power. Maximal thermal damage estimate (TDEmax) achieved in a single plane and time to reach maximal damage (ttdemax) were measured and compared between groups using a 2x3 Fixed Factor Analysis of Covariance. Ablation area change for cases in which an initial thermal dose was followed by a subsequent dose, with increased power, was also assessed. Result(s): We used real-time ablation data from 93 patients across various intracranial pathologies. ttdemax (mean +/- SEM) decreased linearly as power increased (low: 139.2 +/- 10.4 s, medium: 127.5 +/- 4.3 s, high: 103.7 +/- 5.8 s). In cases where a second thermal dose was delivered at higher power, the TDE expanded an average of 51.4 mm2 beyond the initial TDE generated by the first ablation, with the second ablation approaching TDEmax at a higher rate than the initial ablation. Conclusion(s): Increased power results in a larger TDEmax and an increased ablation rate. In cases where an initial thermal dose does not fully ablate the target lesion, a second ablation at higher power can increase the area of ablation with an increased ablation rate.Copyright © 2017, © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",Excluded
2121,"[Hypothyroidism incidence after multimodal treatment for laryngeal cancer]. BACKGROUND: Hypothyroidism following total laryngectomy or radiotherapy treatment for laryngeal cancer is not a rare event, especially in advanced stages. There are no reports on the incidence of hypothyroidism in patients who received chemotherapy and radiotherapy. The objective of this study is to determine the incidence of thyroid dysfunction in a group of patients with laryngeal cancer who underwent surgery as sole treatment, total laryngectomy or radiotherapy alone, and patients with combined treatment: surgery plus radiotherapy, concomitant chemoradiation therapy and chemoradiation therapy plus salvage surgery., METHODS: A prospective study of patients diagnosed with laryngeal cancer whose serum TSH and T4 levels were evaluated in a serial fashion., RESULTS: 70 patients with laryngeal cancer were studied; the average age at diagnosis was 70.2 years. Male patients were more affected, with a men-women ratio of 3.6:1. Glottic localization was the most frequent (44%). 64% of tumors were locally advanced carcinomas and 51% received multimodal treatment. 45 patients (63%) were diagnosed with hypothyroidism; 49% of the patients with subclinical hypothyroidism, and 51% with clinical hypothyroidism., CONCLUSIONS: Hypothyroidism is a complication following treatment for laryngeal cancer. It is recommended to evaluate the thyroid function periodically for timely detection.",Excluded
1778,"Less is More: The Impact of Multidisciplinary Thyroid Conference on the Treatment of Well-Differentiated Thyroid Carcinoma. BACKGROUND: In 2006, a multidisciplinary thyroid conference (MDTC) was implemented to better plan management of thyroid cancer patients at our institution. This study assessed the clinical impact of a MDTC on radioactive iodine (RAI) treatment patterns., METHODS: A prospective database (2003-2014) collected patient and tumor characteristics, RAI doses, and tumor recurrences. Patients treated with total thyroidectomy for differentiated thyroid carcinoma >=1 cm were stratified based on American Thyroid Association (ATA) risk classification. RAI regimens were compared before initiation of MDTC (2003-2005, n = 88), after establishment of MDTC (2007-2009, n = 95), and after the release of 2009 ATA guidelines (2011-2014, n = 181). RAI doses were defined as low (<=75 mCi), intermediate (76-150 mCi), and high (>150 mCi)., RESULTS: There was a significant decrease in the number of patients who received high-dose RAI after implementation of MDTC compared to before initiation of MDTC in the intermediate and high-risk patient groups (p = 0.04 and p < 0.01) without an associated increase in tumor recurrence (11 vs. 7%, p = 0.74). On multivariable analysis, presentation of a patient at MDTC was a negative predictor for receiving high-dose RAI (p = 0.002). As might be expected, there was also a significant decrease in use of RAI after the 2009 ATA guidelines were issued compared to after implementation of MDTC (p < 0.01)., CONCLUSION: In conjunction with implementation of a thyroid malignancy multidisciplinary conference, we observed significantly decreased postoperative dosing of RAI without increased tumor recurrence. The 2009 ATA guidelines were associated with a further decrease in RAI administration. Treatment for patients with thyroid carcinoma is optimized by a multidisciplinary approach.",Excluded
115,"Age does not worsen the efficacy nor tolerance to combined induction therapies in locally advanced non-small cell lung cancer. Background: One third of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) affects elderly patients in a locally advanced (LA) stage. Induction therapy followed by a curative approach is becoming the standard-of-care for LA-NSCLC. Patients and Methods: We compared the efficacy and tolerance to induction chemotherapy or chemo-radiation followed by surgery or definitive radiotherapy in patients younger (N=64) and older (N=44) than 70 years with LA-NSCLC. Result(s): Elderly patients trended towards having a worse baseline performance status, and presented a higher percentage of IIIB, and squamous tumors. Nevertheless, no significant differences in response rate, operability, or disease-free and overall survival were found between age groups in the whole series, nor in the sub-group of resected patients. Grade 3-4 toxicity tended to be lower in elderly patients. Conclusion(s): Age by itself did not significantly worsen either the efficacy or tolerance to combined induction and definitive treatment in patients with LA-NSCLC and Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status 0-2.Copyright © 2014, International Institute of Anticancer Research.

3651,"Optimal timing for salvage surgery after definitive radiotherapy in hypopharyngeal cancer. Purpose: Use of radiotherapy combined with chemotherapy is increasing in hypopharyngeal cancer. However, many show residual tumor after radiotherapy. Timing for treatment evaluation and salvage therapy is essential. However, optimal timing for salvage surgery has not been suggested. In this study, we tried to evaluate optimal timing for salvage surgery. Methods and Materials: Patients who were diagnosed with hypopharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma between 2006 and 2015 were retrospectively analyzed. All patients received definitive radiotherapy with or without chemotherapy. Response of all treated patients were analyzed at 1, 3, and 6 months after radiotherapy. Any patients with progression before 6 months were excluded. Result(s): A total of 54 patients were analyzed. Complete remission (CR) rates at 1 month (CR1), 3 months (CR3) and 6 months (CR6) were 66.7%, 81.5%, and 90.7%, respectively. Non-CR at 1 month (NCR1), 3 months (NCR3), and 6 months (NCR6) showed poor locoregional recurrence-free survival rates (1-year rates of 63.7%, 66.7%, and 0.0%, respectively) compared to CR1, CR3, and CR6 (1-year rates 94.3%, 88.0%, and 91.5%, respectively). Particularly significant differences were seen between CR6 and NCR6 (p < 0.001). Of 10 patients with NCR3, 5 showed CR at 6 months (NCR3/CR6). There was no statistical difference in locoregional recurrence-free survival between CR3 and NCR3/CR6 group (p = 0.990). Conclusion(s): Our data suggest half of patients who did not show CR at 3 months eventually achieved CR at 6 months.

2678,"Impact of treatment interruptions due to toxicity on outcome of patients with early stage (I/II) non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) treated with hyperfractionated radiation therapy alone. We investigated the effect of treatment interruptions due to high-grade (> or =3) toxicity on outcome of patients with early stage (I/II) non-small-cell lung cancer treated with hyperfractionated radiation therapy (Hfx RT). Of 116 patients treated with total tumour doses of 69.6 Gy, 1.2 Gy b.i.d. fractionation, 44 patients refused surgery while 72 patients were medically inoperable due to existing co-morbid states. Patients who were medically inoperable had worse KPS (P=0.0059) and more pronounced weight loss (P=0.0005). Among them, 12 patients experienced high-grade toxicity and 11 of them with either acute (n=6) or ""consequential"" late (n=5) high-grade toxicity requested interruption in the Hfx RT course (range, 12-25 days; median, 17 days). Superior survival (OS) was observed in patients who refused surgery when compared to those who were medically inoperable (P=0.0041), as well as superior local recurrence-free survival (LRFS) (P=0.011), but not different distant metastasis-free survival (P=0.14). Cause-specific survival (CSS) also favoured patients who refused surgery (P=0.004). Multivariate analysis showed independent influence of the reason for not undergoing surgery on OS (P=0.035), but not on LRFS (P=0.084) or CSS (P=0.068). Patients who refused surgery did not experience high-grade toxicity (0/44), whereas 11 of 72 patients with medical inoperability and co-morbid states experienced high-grade toxicity and had treatment interruptions to manage toxicity (P=0.0064). Patients without treatment interruptions had significantly better OS (P=0.00000), LRFS (P=0.00000) and CSS (P=0.00000) than those with treatment interruptions. When corrected for treatment interruptions, the reason for not undergoing surgery independently influenced OS (P=0.040), but not LRFS (P=0.092) or CSS (P=0.068). In contrast to this, treatment interruption was independent prognosticator of all three endpoints used (P=0.00031, P=0.0075 and P=0.00033, respectively). When 11 patients with treatment interruptions were excluded, the reason for not undergoing surgery still affected OS (P=0.037) and CSS (P=0.039) but not LRFS (P=0.11). Multivariate analyses using OS, CSS and LRFS showed that the reason for not undergoing surgery affected OS (P=0.0436), but neither CSS (P=0.083) nor LRFS (P=0.080).",Excluded
1690,"Relationship between body composition and development of diabetes in non-obese Japanese subjects. Background : Body mass index (BMI) is a simple and good index to detect individuals with high risk of developing diabetes, though not all obese people develop diabetes. In comparison with populations in USA and Europe, Asian populations have a lower frequency of obesity, and a relatively higher risk of diabetes in non-obese populations. Although epidemiology studies reveal association between body composition and cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factors, very few studies have examined the relationship between body composition and these risk factors in non-obese subjects. Objectives : The purpose of this prospective cohort study was to examine association of body composition with incidence of diabetes, a CVD risk factor, in non-obese Japanese subjects. Methods : The subjects of this study were 1,137 non-obese subjects without diabetes at baseline (368 males and 769 females, with an average age of 65.2) in the Hiroshima Adult Health Study that consists of atomic bomb survivors and their controls. Body composition was estimated by whole body DXA during the period from 1994 through 1996. We used percentages of trunk, leg, and arm fat in relation to total soft tissue mass as surrogate indicators of body fat distribution, and the ratio of appendicular lean mass/height2 (ALM/H2) as a surrogate indicator of appendicular muscle mass volume. Diabetes was defined by fasting glucose >=126mg/dl (7.0 mmol/L) or random glucose >= 200 mg/dL (11.1 mmol/L), a history of diabetes diagnosis by a medical institution, or current treatment for diabetes. Results : During the follow-up period lasting until 2011, 133 subjects developed diabetes. In Cox regression analyses with adjustment for BMI, presence of hypertension and dyslipidemia, radiation dose, and smoking and alcohol consumption status, significant negative association was observed between ALM/H2 and diabetes risk in men. Regarding body fat distribution, trunk fat percentage was positively associated with the incidence of diabetes and it was statistically significant only in men. On the other hand, leg fat percentage was significantly and negatively associated with the incidence of diabetes in women. . Significant association between the percentage of arm fat and diabetes risk was not observed in either gender. Conclusions : Among non-obese subjects, we found body composition to be associated with diabetes risk. Therefore, for Japanese people, body composition may be a useful tool for identifying individuals with high risk of developing diabetes.",Excluded
3477,"Endonasal phototherapy significantly alleviates symptoms of allergic rhinitis, but has a limited impact on the nasal mucosal immune cells. The literature documents the fact that UV irradiation of cutaneous Langerhans cells (LC) in vivo prevents the development of contact allergy and produces long-lasting immunosuppression. However, not much is known about the effect of UV irradiation on the LC of the nasal mucosa and their connection with clinical scores. Local antigen presentation may be necessary for both primary and recall T cell responses to birch pollen in patients with hay fever. Endonasal phototherapy combination of UVB (5%), UVA (25%) and visible light (70%) utilises the immunosuppressive effects of UV irradiation. The aim of this study was to correlate clinical symptom scores with possible changes in the LC of the nasal mucosa induced by UV radiation. The clinical effectiveness of this form of treatment is discussed. Nasal biopsies were obtained from ten birch pollen-sensitive patients with seasonal rhinitis before and after endonasal phototherapy. All patients showed a significant clinical benefit post-treatment as assessed by standardised instruments, including total nasal symptom score, nasal congestion score, nasal itching score, sneezing score, nasal secretion score and impairment-to-health score. However, we found no significant morphological changes, to, or quantitative differences in, the CD1a+, CD4, CD8 or CD31 cells before and 14 days after treatment. Despite the positive clinical effect, the study revealed no effect of UV irradiation on the LC and other analysed cells of the nasal mucosa immune system.

We S ought to ascertain how high the success rates of radioiodine therapy are for Graves' disease patients with large diffuse goiters when aiming for a constant absorbed dose of 250 Gy. Thirty-six patients with a thyroid volume of 50-110 mL were evaluated for changes in thyroid function and appearance 3, 6, and 12 months after radioiodine therapy. Success was defined as definitive elimination of hyperthyroidism following therapy (hypothyroidism corrected with thyroxine on diagnosis); failure as persistent/recurrent hyperthyroidism after 12 months. Overall success rate was 50%. However, a subgroup of 20 patients without simultaneous carbimazole (carbimazole-off) showed a highly significantly larger success rate (85%) than the 16 patients with simultaneous carbimazole (carbimazole-on) at the time of radioiodine therapy (6.3%, p< 0.000005). Successful cases showed a significantly higher volume reduction after radioiodine than failures (75.5% vs. 35.4%, p < 0.00005). Stepwise logistic regression showed that therapy failure was related to administration of carbimazole during radioiodine therapy (p < 0.0250 and absorbed dose (p < 0.05), but not thyroid function (free triiodothyronine [FT3] and free thyroxine [FT4]), initial thyroid volume or thyrotropin-receptor antibody (TRAb) value. However, a significant correlation of therapy success to absorbed dose (r = 0.69, p < 0.005) could be shown only for carbimazole-off patients, but not for the others. Finally, multivariate favor analysis consistently showed that therapy success was correlated only to absorbed dose and antithyroid drugs, not to initial thyroid volume, TRAb value, or thyroid function. Thyroid volume per se is not responsible for the lower success rate in Graves' disease patients with large goiters because even a comparable group of 32 Graves' disease patients with small thyroid glands (<=20 mL) and without simultaneous carbimazole showed a success rate of 87.5%. The high failure rate in the carbimazole-on patients (absorbed dose comparable to carbimazole-off) is due to the simultaneous administration of carbimazole. Therefore, if clinically feasible, we recommend discontinuing carbimazole at least one day before beginning radioiodine therapy.",Excluded
3694,"The impact of the effective dose to immune cells on lymphopenia and survival of esophageal cancer after chemoradiotherapy. Purpose: To test the hypothesis that effective dose to circulating immune cells (EDIC) impacts the severity of radiation-induced lymphopenia and clinical outcomes of esophageal cancer patients treated with concurrent chemoradiotherapy (CCRT). Material(s) and Method(s): 488 esophageal cancer patients treated with CCRT with and without surgery were analyzed. The EDIC model considers the exposure of circulating immune cells as the proportion of blood flow to lung, heart, liver, and the volume of the exposed area of the body, with the basis of mean lung dose (MLD), mean heart dose (MHD), mean liver dose (MlD), and integral dose (ITD) of the body region scanned, calculated as: EDIC=0.12*MLD+0.08*MHD+0.15*0.85*MlD*[Formula presented]1/2+0.45+0.35*0.85*[Formula presented]1/2*[Formula presented] Where n is the fraction number. Correlations of EDIC with overall survival (OS), progression free survival (PFS), distant metastasis free survival (DMFS), and locoregional control (LRC) rates were analyzed using both univariable and multivariable Cox models. Lymphopenia during CCRT was graded according to Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events version 4.0. Result(s): Grade 4 lymphopenia resulted in inferior clinical outcomes, including OS, PFS, and DMFS. The median EDIC was 3.6 Gy (range, 0.8-6.0 Gy). Higher EDIC was strongly associated with severe lymphopenia, particularly when EDIC was above 4 Gy. Patients with EDIC > 4.0 Gy had more G4 lymphopenia than those with EDIC <= 4.0 Gy (67.3% vs. 40.8%; P < 0.001). On multivariate analysis, increasing EDIC was independently and inversely associated with worse OS, PFS, and DMFS. Conclusion(s): EDIC can be recommended as a useful tool to predict lymphopenia and inferior clinical outcomes, and it should be minimized below 4 Gy.Copyright © 2020 Elsevier B.V.",Excluded
1761,"Molecular and cellular profiling of acute responses to total body radiation exposure in ovariectomized female cynomolgus macaques. Purpose: The threat of radiation exposure requires a mechanistic understanding of radiation-induced immune injury and recovery. The study objective was to evaluate responses to ionizing radiation in ovariectomized (surgically post-menopausal) female cynomolgus macaques. Material(s) and Method(s): Animals received a single total-body irradiation (TBI) exposure at doses of 0, 2 or 5 Gy with scheduled necropsies at 5 days, 8 weeks and 24 weeks post-exposure. Blood and lymphoid tissues were evaluated for morphologic, cellular, and molecular responses. Result(s): Irradiated animals developed symptoms of acute hematopoietic syndrome, and reductions in thymus weight, thymopoiesis, and bone marrow cellularity. Acute, transient increases in plasma monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 (MCP1) were observed in 5 Gy animals along with dose-dependent alterations in messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) signatures in thymus, spleen, and lymph node. Expression of T cell markers was lower in thymus and spleen, while expression of macrophage marker CD68 (cluster of differentiation 68) was relatively elevated in lymphoid tissues from irradiated animals. Conclusion(s): Ovariectomized female macaques exposed to moderate doses of radiation experienced increased morbidity, including acute, dose-dependent alterations in systemic and tissue-specific biomarkers, and increased macrophage/T cell ratios. The effects on mortality exceeded expectations based on previous studies in males, warranting further investigation.Copyright © 2015 Informa UK, Ltd.",Excluded
145,"Significant correlations between human cortical bone mineral density and quantitative susceptibility mapping (QSM) obtained with 3D Cones ultrashort echo time magnetic resonance imaging (UTE-MRI). PURPOSE: Quantitative susceptibility mapping (QSM) MRI is a tool that can characterize changes in susceptibility, an intrinsic property which is associated with compositional changes in the tissue. Current QSM estimation of cortical bone is challenging because conventional clinical MRI cannot acquire signal in cortical bone. This study aimed to implement Cones 3D ultrashort echo time MRI (UTE-MRI) for ex vivo QSM measurements in human tibial cortical bone, investigating the correlations of QSM with volumetric intracortical bone mineral density (BMD)., MATERIALS AND METHODS: Nine tibial midshaft cortical bone specimens (25mm long specimens cut at the mid-point of tibial shaft, 67+/-20years old, 5 women and 4 men) were scanned on a clinical 3T MRI scanner for QSM measurement. The specimens were also scanned on a high-resolution micro-computed tomography (muCT) scanner for volumetric BMD estimation. QSM and muCT results were compared at approximately nine regions of interest (ROIs) per specimen., RESULTS: Average 3D UTE-MRI QSM showed significantly strong correlation with volumetric BMD (R=-0.82, P<0.01) and bone porosity (R=0.72, P<0.01). Combining all data points together (77 ROIs), QSM showed significant moderate to strong correlation with volumetric BMD after correction for interdependencies in specimens (R=-0.70, P<0.01). The corrections were required because the data points were not independent in each specimen. Similarly, the correlation between QSM and porosity was significant (R=0.68, P<0.01)., CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that the Cones 3D UTE-MRI QSM technique can potentially serve as a novel and accurate tool to assess intracortical bone mineral density whilst avoiding ionizing radiation.

60,"Experience with wound complications after surgery for sacral tumors. Purpose: The aim of this article is to summarize our experience in treating sacral wound complications after sacrectomy. We focus, in particular, on factors associated with wound complications, including surgical site infection (SSI) and wound dehiscence. Method(s): The definition of SSI devised by Horgan et al. was applied. Wound dehiscence was defined as a wound showing breakdown in the absence of clinical signs meeting the diagnostic standard for SSI. Between September 1997 and August 2009, 387 patients with a sacral tumor underwent sacrectomy performed by the same team of surgeons and were followed up for >=12 months. Potential risk factors were evaluated for univariate associations with SSI and wound complications. Multivariable conditional logistic regression was used to identify the combined effects of several risk factors. Result(s): Of the 387 wounds studied, 274 healed uneventfully, and 113 (29.2 %) broke down because of infection or dehiscence. Fifty-one (13.2 %) patients developed a postoperative SSI, and 62 (16.0 %) patients developed wound dehiscence. Gram-negative bacteria grew in 45 cultures (91.8 %) and included 38 cases of Escherichia coli. Previous radiation, rectum rupture, longer duration of surgery, and cerebrospinal fluid leakage were significantly associated with increased likelihood of developing an SSI. Previous radiation, rectum rupture, age <40 years, history of diabetes mellitus, maximum tumor diameter >=10 cm, and instrumentation used were risk factors for wound complications. Conclusion(s): The incidence of wound complications is not so high at a musculoskeletal tumor center with surgeons experienced in treating sacral tumors. Controlling for these risk factors when possible may improve clinical outcomes. © 2013 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.",Excluded
1554,"Radiation. Exposure to solar and ionizing radiation increases the risk for cancer in humans. Some 5% of solar radiation is within the ultraviolet spectrum and may cause both malignant melanoma and non-melanocytic skin cancer; the latter is regarded as a benign disease and is accordingly not included in our estimation of avoidable cancers. Under the assumption that the rate of occurrence of malignant melanoma of the buttocks of both men and women and of the scalp of women would apply to all parts of the body in people completely unexposed to solar radiation, it was estimated that approximately 95% of all malignant melanomas arising in the Nordic populations around the year 2000 will be due to exposure to natural ultraviolet radiation, equivalent to an annual number of about 4700 cases, with 2100 in men and 2600 in women, or some 4% of all cancers notified. Exposure to ionizing radiation in the Nordic countries occurs at an average effective dose per capita per year of about 3 mSv (Iceland, 1.1 mSv) from natural sources, and about 1 mSv from man-made sources. While the natural sources are primarily radon in indoor air, natural radionuclides in food, cosmic radiation and gamma radiation from soil and building materials, the man-made sources are dominated by the diagnostic and therapeutic use of ionizing radiation. On the basis of measured levels of radon in Nordic dwellings and associated risk estimates for lung cancer derived from well-conducted epidemiological studies, we estimated that about 180 cases of lung cancer (1% of all lung cancer cases) per year could be avoided in the Nordic countries around the year 2000 if indoor exposure to radon were eliminated, and that an additional 720 cases (6%) could be avoided annually if either radon or tobacco smoking were eliminated. Similarly, it was estimated that the exposure of the Nordic populations to natural sources of ionizing radiation other than radon and to medical sources will each give rise to an annual total of 2120 cancers at various sites. For all types of ionizing radiation, the annual total will be 4420 cancer cases, or 3.9% of all cancers arising in the Nordic populations, with 3.4% in men and 4.4% in women.",Excluded
1508,"Cytogenetic and molecular characterization of plutonium-induced rat osteosarcomas. The association between ionizing radiation and the subsequent development of osteosarcoma has been well described, but little is known about the cytogenetic and molecular events, which could be involved in the formation of radiation-induced osteosarcomas. Here, we performed comparative genomic hybridization (CGH) to detect chromosomal copy number changes in a series of 16 rat osteosarcomas induced by injection of plutonium-238. Recurrent gains/amplifications were observed at chromosomal regions 3p12-q12, 3q41-qter, 4q41-qter, 6q12-q16, 7q22-q34, 8q11-q23, 9q11-q22, 10q32.1-qter, and 12q, whereas recurrent losses were observed at 1p, 1q, 3q23-q35, 5q21-q33, 8q24-q31, 10q22-q25, 15p, 15q, and 18q. The gained region at 7q22-q34 was homologous to human chromosome bands 12q13-q15/8q24/22q11-q13, including the loci of Mdm2, Cdk4, c-Myc and Pdgf-b genes. The lost regions at 5q21-q33, 10q22-q25 and 15q contained tumor suppressor genes such as p16INK4a/p19ARF, Tp53 and Rb1. To identify potential target gene(s) for the chromosomal aberrations, we compared the expression levels of several candidate genes, located within the regions of frequent chromosomal aberrations, between the tumors and normal osteoblasts by using quantitative RT-PCR analysis. The Cdk4, c-Myc, Pdgf-b and p57KIP2 genes were thought to be possible target genes for the frequent chromosomal gain at 7q22-34 and loss at 1q in the tumors, respectively. In addition, mutations of the Tp53 gene were found in 27% (4 of 15) osteosarcomas. Our data may contribute to further understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying osteosarcomas induced by ionizing radiation in human.",Excluded
1856,"Radiation-induced sarcoma of head and neck: 50 years of experience at a single institution in an endemic area of nasopharyngeal carcinoma in China. Radiation-induced sarcoma in the head and neck (RISHN) is a rare condition whose clinical presentation and management remain difficult because of its low incidence. In this retrospective study, we analyzed the symptoms, diagnosis, and the treatment of 16,634 patients with head and neck disease, who received radiotherapy between 1960 and 2010 at the Affiliated Tumor Hospital and its predecessor, Guangxi Medical University, China. Among these patients, 16 with a first tumor of nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) and 1 with squamous carcinoma of the tongue met the criteria of RISHN in the head and neck. Our epidemiological data showed that the incidence of RISHN rose from 0.06 to 0.17% from 1960 to 2010; the 3-year overall survival rate was 19.1%, and 3-year diseasefree survival rate was 11.1%. The mean latency (SD) period was 93.2 (33) months. Based on the experiences at our institution, we suggest that RISHN is a rare complication after radiotherapy for head and neck tumors, especially NPC. Owing to its low incidence, it should not be a major factor affecting decisions about radiotherapy. Nevertheless, there may be a possibility of increasing incidence of RISHN after radiotherapy of NPC, as shown in our epidemiological results. Given the poor prognosis of RISHN, this possibility should be taken into serious consideration before determination of high-dose radiotherapy for patients with NPC and other head and neck tumors. © Springer Science+Business Media, LLC 2011.",Excluded
2713,"Automated Planning to Improve Linac-Based Stereotactic Radiosurgery Plan Quality in Patients with 4 up to 10 Brain Metastases. Purpose/Objective(s): Stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) is a promising treatment option for patients with multiple brain metastases (BM). We studied whether automated planning can improve LINAC-based SRS plan quality for multiple BM. Additionally, the use of one isocenter instead of separate isocentres for each metastasis was studied. Materials/Methods: For 12 patients with 4 up to 10 brain metastases, five non-coplanar LINAC-based SRS plans were created for 6MV photons: a manually planed dynamic conformal arc (DCA) plan with a separate isocenter for each metastasis, a dynamic IMRT plan with one isocenter, a VMAT plan with one isocenter, two DCA plans with one isocenter for 3 and 5 couch rotations. The last three plans were automatically generated. The maximum allowed gross tumor volume to planning target volume (PTV) margin was 1 mm. The prescription dose was 21 Gy or 18 Gy in a single fraction or 8.5 Gy in 3 fractions depending on the PTV volume. All plans were calculated with Monte Carlo, except the VMAT which was calculated with Collapsed Cone algorithm. The PTV coverage should be at least 98%. To assess SRS plan quality, the Paddick conformity index (CI), the Paddick gradient index (GI), the total V12Gy and V5Gy were studied and reported as MEAN+/-1SD. The number of monitor units (MU) and irradiation time were also compared. Result(s): The mean total CI was the highest for dynamic IMRT (see table). The lowest GI was for DCA plans with the separate-isocenter approach (3.7+/-0.6) and automatically generated DCA plans with one isocenter, whereas the highest GI was for VMAT plans (7.0+/-3.0). Moreover, the GI was 4.4+/-0.6 and 4.2+/-0.6 for automatically generated DCA plans with 3 couch and 5 couch rotations, respectively. The total V12Gy of automatically generated DCA plans with one isocenter (4.7+/-5.6% and 4.1+/-4.3% for 3 and 5 couch rotations, respectively) and dynamic IMRT plans (4.4+/-4.5%) were comparable with the manual DCA plans (3.6+/-3.7%). For the total V5Gy, quite the same behaviour as for the GI was found. The number of MU was the smallest for VMAT plans, followed by automatically generated DCA and IMRT plans and much lower than the manual DCA plans. The irradiation time was the smallest for automatically planned DCA plans followed by VMAT and IMRT plans. Conclusion(s): Automatically generated LINAC-based SRS plans for multiple BM in one isocenter can make the number of MU and irradiation time smaller with a comparable plan quality to manual DCA plans with the separate-isocenter approach. Based on all compared parameters, dynamic IMRT and DCA plans with one isocenter were the best and comparable with manual DCA plans with separate isocentres for each metastasis. Moreover, we can conclude that automated DCA plans with 5 couch and 3 couch rotations were comparable. [Figure presented]Copyright © 2019",Excluded
2883,"Lateral mandibular reconstruction using soft-tissue free flaps and plates. OBJECTIVE: To assess the outcome of patients who are undergoing reconstruction of segmental lateral mandibular defects by using soft-tissue free flaps combined with mandibular reconstruction plates., DESIGN: Retrospective case series of 15 patients who were undergoing primary reconstruction of mandibular segments posterior to the mental foramen, resulting from treatment of head and neck cancer. All patients received either preoperative or postoperative radiation therapy., SETTING: Academic tertiary care referral center., INTERVENTIONS: Fourteen patients had mandibular continuity restored by using the titanium hollow screw reconstruction plate system, and 1 patient received a stainless steel mandibular reconstruction plate. Associated soft-tissue defects were repaired by using radial forearm (n = 11), rectus abdominis (n = 2), scapular and parascapular (n = 1), or lateral arm (n = 1) free flaps., MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Early and delayed complications., RESULTS: All 15 microvascular free tissue transfers were successful. Early complications were minor and occurred in 5 (33%) of 15 patients. One patient in whom the titanium hollow screw reconstruction plate system had been used experienced a fracture at 15 months after reconstruction. Three patients experienced delayed external plate exposure between 7 and 15 months after primary oromandibular reconstruction. Patients who experienced delayed external plate exposure required secondary reconstruction with a vascularized bone-containing free flap. The overall rate of delayed reconstructive failure was 40% in patients who were followed up for a minimum of 1 year., CONCLUSIONS: For patients who are undergoing free flap reconstruction of lateral mandibulectomy defects, the technique that used soft-tissue free flaps combined with mandibular reconstruction plates has been abandoned in favor of using vascularized bone-containing free flaps or a combination of free flaps to achieve optimal long-term results.",Excluded

2314,"Can FRAX help portuguese men?. The Portuguese model of the FRAX algorithm became available in June 2011. We reviewed the value of FRAX in a male population, to evaluate (1) if FRAX can identify patients with fracture risk (2) If it is relevant in patients without established risk factors. We reviewed all the DXA examinations in 2,5 years (1st July 2013 to 30th December 2015).A total of 6185 patients were examined with at least spine and femur analysis. During this period 395 examinations were done in men, of which 49 were excluded (7 which were incomplete and 42 patients who were on osteoporosis therapy). The study population consisted therefore of 346 examinations. Patients filled in a questionnaire. The technologist reviewed that data, inquired about fracture mechanisms and discussed risk factors with the patients. In many cases other relevant examinations (spine or hip x-ray, CT, MR) could be accessed on PACS. We had no laboratorial data. Previous fragility fractures were identified in 84 patients. For this study,FRAX values in patients with fractures were calculated ""without fracture"". We chose 10% as the threshold for the 10 year probability of major osteoporotic fracture (PMOF). The ratio of fractures increased slightly with age groups, except after 80y, and was very similar to osteoporosis diagnosed by DXA. Correlation with FRAX values was less reliable and FRAX identified much fewer cases. In patients without risk factors,FRAX didn't identify any patient with 10 year PMOF > 8%. The study population has several limitations: Its size is very small in comparison with studies with female patients, and it can suffer a selection bias. The poor performance of the FRAX threshold against DXAT-scores should be validated in a larger and prospective study. In the Portuguese male population even FRAX values computed with bone mineral density (BMD) data can sub evaluate fracture risk. FRAX values obtained without BMD should be interpreted with precaution. (Figure Presented).",Excluded
1688,"Identifying an optimal adjuvant radiotherapy dose for extremity and trunk Merkel cell carcinoma following resection: An analysis of the national cancer database. IMPORTANCE: Merkel cell carcinoma (MCC) is a rare and aggressive cutaneous neuroendocrine neoplasm with a high risk of recurrence following resection. Despite a rising incidence over the past 3 decades, there is a paucity of prospective data owing to the rarity of this disease. OBJECTIVE(S): To determine the optimal adjuvant radiation therapy (RT) dose following resection of localized MCC of the extremities or trunk. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Using the National Cancer Database, a large national database consisting of a heterogeneous population and treatment settings, we retrospectively analyzed a cohort of 2093 patients 18 years or older with stage I to III MCC of the extremities and/or trunk treated with definitive surgery and adjuvant RT between 1998 and 2011. Exclusion criteria included receiving treatment with palliative intent, preoperative RT, non-external-beam RT, and radiation dose of 30 Gy or lower or 70 Gy or higher. Cox proportional hazards regression model was used to compare overall survival (OS) between RT dose groups, accounting for age, sex, race, stage, surgery type, margin status, comorbidities, and use of chemotherapy. EXPOSURES: Radiation therapy dose was categorized into 4 groups: group 1 received the lowest dose (>30 to <40 Gy); group 2, the next lowest (40 to <50 Gy); group 3, the second highest dose (50 to 55 Gy); and group 4, the highest dose (>55 to 70 Gy). MAIN OUTCOME AND MEASURE: Overall survival. RESULT(S): Data from 2093 patients were analyzed; there were 1293 men (61.8%) and 800 women (38.2%) (median age, 73 years). After a median follow-up of 37 months for the entire cohort, 904 deaths were reported. The 3-year OS rates for groups 1, 2, 3, and 4 were 41.8%, 69%, 69.2%, and 66%, respectively (omnibus P < .001). Compared with group 3 (50 to 55 Gy), equivalent OS was seen in group 2 (40 to <50 Gy; adjusted hazard ratio [AHR], 0.89; 95% CI, 0.63-1.27; P = .52) and group 4 (>55 to 70 Gy; AHR, 1.18; 95% CI, 0.93-1.48; P = .17), but worse OS was found in group 1 (>30 to <40 Gy; AHR, 2.63; 95% CI, 1.44-4.80; P < .001). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Adjuvant RT dose from 40 to lower than 50 Gy appears adequate for extremities and/or trunk stage I to III MCC, with OS equivalent to that found at higher-dose regimens (>50 to 70 Gy).Copyright © 2017 American Medical Association.

621,"Concomitant cisplatin and radiotherapy in a conventional and modified fractionation schedule in locally advanced head and neck cancer: A randomised phase II EORTC trial. A randomised phase II trial was initiated to explore the feasibility of concomitant cisplatin and radiotherapy with conventional fractionation (CF) or multiple fractions per day (MFD) for patients with locally advanced head and neck malignancies. The MFD schedule was designed to achieve higher tumour concentrations of cisplatin at the time of irradiation by reducing the number of radiation treatment weeks from 7 to 3, allowing recovery from side-effects of both irradiation and cystostatic drugs during the rest periods, while keeping the same total dose and overall treatment time. Patients were randomised between a conventional fractionation scheme (CF) of 70 Gy in 7 weeks with 2 Gy per fraction with a daily dose of 6 mg/m2 cisplatin and a modified fractionation scheme (MFD) delivering three fractions of 1.6 Gy per day, in weeks 1, 4 and 7, keeping the same overall treatment time and total dose. In the modified treatment regime, a daily dose of 10 mg/m2 cisplatin was administered. 53 patients were entered in this trial and radiotherapy was given according to the schedule to all patients in both treatment arms. Cisplatin was given during the whole course of radiotherapy to only one quarter of the patients in the CF arm, stopping mostly after 5-6 weeks due to bone marrow depression and kidney toxicity, while patients in the MFD arm received it according to schedule. No difference was observed in acute and late toxicity in both treatment arms, while a similar or even better tumour response was obtained with MFD. A 67% higher daily dose of cisplatin concomitant with irradiation could be given in a 3-week multiple fractionation per day schedule, as opposed to the cisplatin given in the conventional daily fractionation schedule of 7 weeks with the same total radiation dose. Similar acute and late toxicities were seen in both treatment arms. © 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.",Excluded
817,"Gut microbial dysbiosis is associated with development and progression of radiation enteritis during pelvic radiotherapy. Radiation enteritis (RE) is the most common complication of radiotherapy for pelvic irradiation receivers. Herein we investigated the alterations in gut microbial profiles and their association with enteritis in patients undergoing pelvic radiotherapy. Faecal samples were collected from 18 cervical cancer patients during radiotherapy. Microbiota profiles were characterized based on 16S rRNA sequencing using the Illumina HiSeq platform. Epithelial inflammatory response was evaluated using bacterial-epithelial co-cultures. Dysbiosis was observed among patients with RE, which was characterized by significantly reduced alpha-diversity but increased beta-diversity, relative higher abundance of Proteobacteria and Gammaproteobacteria and lower abundance of Bacteroides. Coprococcus was clearly enriched prior to radiotherapy in patients who later developed RE. Metastat analysis further revealed unique grade-related microbial features, such as more abundant Virgibacillus and Alcanivorax in patients with mild enteritis. Additionally, using bacterial-epithelial co-cultures, RE patient-derived microbiota induced epithelial inflammation and barrier dysfunction, enhanced TNF-alpha and IL-1beta expression compared with control microbiota. Taken together, we define the overall picture of gut microbiota in patients with RE. Our results suggest that dysbiosis of gut microbiota may contribute to development and progression of RE. Gut microbiota can offer a set of biomarkers for prediction, disease activity evaluation and treatment selection in RE. Copyright © 2019 The Authors.

Our aim was to describe both sun exposure and sun protection behaviour in a series of patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), and to study their potential association with vitaminD concentration., PATIENTS AND METHODS: A cross sectional, observational study. The clinical-demographic variables were obtained via clinical interviews and medical history review. The sunlight exposure assessment was carried out using the Sun Exposure Questionnaire and the concentration of 25-hydroxy vitaminD (25OHD) was measured by an electro-chemiluminescence immunoassay. Questionnaires were conducted on quality of life, physical activity, weekly vitaminD intake and sun protection behaviour., RESULTS: 149 patients were included. In 69% of patients, deficient or insufficient 25OHD values were recorded. 67% showed low sun exposure. A modest significant correlation was observed between the total score of the solar exposure questionnaire and the 25OHD concentration in the complete series (r=0.226, P=.006) and in the summer (r=0.274, P=.01). The sun protection behaviour questionnaire score did not influence the 25OHD concentration. In the multivariate analysis, only the presence of clinical activity was associated with low sun exposure (OR=3.23)., DISCUSSION: Sun exposure according to the questionnaire used was low, was associated with the presence of clinical activity and was weakly correlated with serum 25OHD concentration. More studies are needed to explore the use of individual questionnaires for sun exposure and its relationship with vitaminD in patients with IBD. Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Espana, S.L.U.

189,"The Value of Computed Tomography Imaging of the Head After Ventriculoperitoneal Shunt Surgery in Adults. Background: Patients with a ventriculoperitoneal shunt for hydrocephalus often undergo multiple follow-up computed tomography (CT) scans of the head, increasing the risk for long-term effects of ionizing radiation. The purpose of our study was to evaluate the necessity as a routine diagnostic procedure and cost analysis of routine postoperative CT scan of the head after ventriculoperitoneal shunt surgery. Method(s): In this study, we comprised adults with ventriculoperitoneal shunt operations who underwent early CT scans within 48 hours postoperatively. We reviewed the correlation between revision surgery rate and the experience of surgeons who performed surgery and provided a cost analysis. Result(s): In total, 479 surgeries were performed in 439 patients. Early revision surgery was performed in 11 (2.3%) patients. Reason for revision surgery was malposition in 9 cases and intracerebral hemorrhage in 2 patients. There was no significant correlation between the surgeon's experience and the rate of revision surgery. Placement of the ventricular catheter via an approach other than a standard right or left frontal burr hole resulted in risk of need for surgical shunt revision (P >= 0.002, odds ratio 54, confidence interval 13.5-223). A total of 468 CT scans of the head revealed a normal finding; thus, ~$562,000 could be saved by omitting postoperative head CT scans. Conclusion(s): Routine postoperative head CT scans after fentriculoperitoneal shunting are not necessary in all cases. The reduction of exposure to ionization radiation and the beneficial economic factor are main advantages.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.",Excluded
1491,"Dramatic and prolonged decrease of whole salivary secretion in nasopharyngeal carcinoma patients treated with radiotherapy. Objectives. This study evaluates: (1) the change in whole salivary secretion rates of nasopharyngeal carcinoma patients before, during, and after radiotherapy, especially during the first week of irradiation; (2) the recovery capability of salivary glands up to 2 years postirradiation; and (3) the possible prognostic factors affecting salivary gland functions. Study design. Fifty patients who completed conventional radiotherapy using either once-per-day or hyperfractionated technique were included. Both unstimulated and stimulated whole salivary flow rates and ratios (flow rate compared with baseline) were measured before, during, 1, 3, and 6 months, and 1 and 2 years after radiotherapy. Multivariate analysis of potential prognostic factors affecting the salivary secretion ratio was made. Results. Salivary glands were very radiosensitive and responded to radiation very early. After 720 cGy at the fourth day of the 8-week treatment, the unstimulated and stimulated salivary flow rates had decreased by 40%-50%. The nadir was reached in many patients after 3600 cGy (4 weeks). A second phase of decrease in salivary secretion was noted after completion of radiotherapy. Conclusions. Different mechanisms may be responsible for salivary response after low and high dose of radiation. This study shows no recovery of salivary secretion during the follow-up period, and the best strategy for managing radiation-induced salivary gland damage may be reduction of radiation dose to the glands. © 2006 Elsevier Inc.

PURPOSE: To characterize the relationship between radiation pneumonitis (RP) clinical symptoms and pulmonary metabolic activity on post-treatment [(18)F]-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET)., PATIENTS AND METHODS: We retrospectively studied 101 esophageal cancer patients who underwent restaging FDG-PET/computed tomography imaging 3-12 weeks after completing thoracic radiotherapy. The National Institutes of Health Common Toxicity Criteria, version 3, was used to score the RP clinical symptoms. Linear regression was applied to the FDG-PET/computed tomography images to determine the normalized FDG uptake vs. radiation dose. The pulmonary metabolic radiation response (PMRR) was quantified as this slope. Modeling was performed to determine the interaction of PMRR, mean lung dose (MLD), and the percentage of lung receiving >20 Gy with RP outcomes., RESULTS: Of the 101 patients, 25 had Grade 0, 10 had Grade 1, 60 had Grade 2, 5 had Grade 3, and 1 had Grade 5 RP symptoms. Logistic regression analysis demonstrated that increased values of both MLD and PMRR were associated with a greater probability of RP clinical symptoms (p = 0.032 and p = 0.033, respectively). Spearman's rank correlation found no association between the PMRR and the dosimetric parameters (planning target volume, MLD, percentage of lung receiving >5-30 Gy). Twofold cross-validation demonstrated that the combination of MLD and PMRR was superior to either alone for assessing the development of clinical RP symptoms. The combined MLD (or percentage of lung receiving >20 Gy) and PMRR had a greater sensitivity and accuracy (53.3% and 62.5%, respectively) than either alone., CONCLUSION: The results of this study have demonstrated a significant correlation between RP clinical symptoms and the PMRR measured by FDG-PET/computed tomography after thoracic radiotherapy.",Excluded
1306,"A Multiinstitutional Study on Wasted CT Scans for Over 60,000 Patients. OBJECTIVE. Repeated imaging is an unnecessary source of patient radiation exposure, a detriment to patient satisfaction, and a waste of time and money. Although analysis of rates of repeated and rejected images is mandated in mammography and recommended in radiography, the available data on these rates for CT are limited. MATERIALS AND METHODS. In this retrospective study, an automated repeat-reject rate analysis algorithm was used to quantify repeat rates from 61,102 patient examinations obtained between 2015 and 2018. The algorithm used DICOM metadata to identify repeat acquisitions. We quantified rates for one academic site and one rural site. The method allows scanner-, technologist-, protocol-, and indication-specific rates to be determined. Positive predictive values and sensitivity were estimated for correctly identifying and classifying repeat acquisitions. Repeat rates were compared between sites to identify areas for targeted technologist training. RESULTS. Of 61,102 examinations, 4676 instances of repeat scanning contributed excess radiation dose to patients. Estimated helical overlap repeat rates were 1.4% (95% CI, 1.2-1.6%) for the rural site and 1.1% (95% CI, 1.0-1.2%) for the academic site. Significant differences in rates of repeat imaging required because of bolus tracking (11.6% vs 4.3%; p < 0.001) and helical extension (3.3% vs 1.8%; p < 0.001) were observed between sites. Positive predictive values ranged from 91% to 99% depending on the reason for repeat imaging and site location. Sensitivity of the algorithm was 92% (95% CI, 87-96%). Rates tended to be highest for emergent imaging procedures and exceeded 9% for certain protocols. CONCLUSION. Our multiinstitutional automated quantification of repeat rates for CT provided a useful metric for unnecessary radiation exposure and identification of technologists in need of training.",Excluded

Disease staging based on either PET/MRI or PET/CT was correct for 54 of the 60 patients (90% vs. 90%), with difference between proportions of 0.0 (95% CI, -9 to 9%; P=0.034 for the equivalence test). As compared with reference standard, invasion of lymph nodes was identified with PET/MRI in 100% and with PET/CT in 100%, of the spleen with PET/MRI in 66% and PET/CT in 55%, of the lung with PET/MRI in 60% and PET/CT in 100%, of the liver with PET/MRI in 67% and PET/CT in 100%, and of the bone with PET/MRI in 100% and PET/CT in 50%. The only statistically significant difference between PET/MRI and PET/CT was observed in bony infiltration detection rates. For PET/CT, iodinate contrast medium infusions' average was 86 mL, and exposure to ionizing radiation was estimated to be 4-fold higher than PET/MRI. PET/MRI is a promising safe new alternative in the care of patients with HL.",Excluded
1767,"Allogeneic stem cell transplantation for idiopatic myelofibrosis: A single centre experience. Background: Allogeneic Stem Cell Transplantation (ASCT) is the only curative option for Myelofibrosis (MF). Development of reduced intensity conditioning (RIC) regimens and introduction of Ruxolitinib (Rux) have improved the outcome of ASCT. However, this procedure is still burdened by substantial morbidity and high transplantrelated mortality (TRM). Here we report our experience with ASCT in MF setting, in order to evaluate the factors influencing post-transplant outcome, in term of overall survival (OS) and Progression-free survival (PFS). Method(s): In the last 10 years we performed 30 ASCT on 27 MF patients (pts); 3 pts of them received a second ASCT for MF relapse. The median age was 51 (range: 25-68) years. Driver mutations were found in 23 pts and were: JAK2V617F in 16 (59%), MPL in 3(11%) and CALR mutations in 4 (15%) pts; 4 (15%) pts were defined as ""triple-negative"". According to Dynamic International Prognostic Scoring System (DIPSS) at transplant, pts were stratified into high, intermediate-2 and intermediate-1 risk in 11 (41%), 12 (44%) and 4 (15%) cases, respectively. Considering the first ASCT, donors were matched related (MRD), matched unrelated (MUD) and haploidentical in 18 (67%), 7 (26%), and 2 (7%) of cases, respectively. Conditioning regimen (CR) was RIC in 11 pts (41%) or myeloablative in 16 pts (59%); all CR were Busulfan and Fludarabine-based, in 48% of cases (n=13) associated with Tiothepa. Conventional GVHD prophylaxis regimens were used according to type of ASCT. Splenectomy or spleen irradiation were performed before ASCT in 2 and 6 pts in pre-Rux era; 16 pts (59%) received Rux before ASCT. Source of stem cells were bone marrow in 15 (56%) or peripheral blood stem cells in 12 (44%) pts. OS and PFS have been evaluated by Kaplan-Meier analysis. Result(s): Aafter a median follow-up of 18.5 (range: 0.5 - 175) months from first ASCT, 4/27 pts (15%) died for early TRM, 6 (22%) pts for MF relapse (4) or leukemic evolution (2). 17 (63%) pts were alive, 15 of them with full chimerism and complete remission (one after the second ASCT); 2 pts were alive in MF relapse. Chronic GVHD occurred in 6 (22%) pts. The probability of OS for the entire cohort at 2 and 5 years was respectively 75% and 60% and the 2 and 5 year PFS was 75% and 55% respectively. In statistical analysis, significant predictive factors of good outcome were: intermediate-1 DIPSS score at transplant, Rux-exposition pre-transplant and development of chronic GVHD. There was no correlation between clinical outcome and type of driver mutations, age at transplant, donor type, CR, source of stem cells. Conclusion(s): ASCT in MF is actually a valid therapeutic option for pts eligible to the procedure also in the Rux era. In our experience, earlier stage of MF at time of transplant and Rux exposition before transplant seem to have a favourable impact on the outcome post-ASCT; also a chronic GVHD seems to play a protective role for reducing relapse risk post-ASCT.",Excluded
296,"Coronary CT angiography performed by the novel whole organ volumetric high definition CT scanner in patients with atrial fibrillation. Objectives: To evaluate the image quality, coronary interpretability and radiation exposure of coronary CT angiography (CCTA) performed with a newest generation of cardiac-CT scanner in patients with atrial fibrillation (AF). Background(s): Despite the relevant improvement in the CT temporal resolution that characterizes the last scanner generation, the evaluation of coronary arteries by CCTA in patients with AF remains the more challenging application of cardiac- CT, particularly in patients with heart rate (HR) >75 bpm. Moreover, the radiation exposure associated with CT is still very high in this clinical subset. Material(s) and Method(s): 49 patients (30 males, mean age 71,5+/-7,3 years old) with chronic AF undergoing CCTA for suspected CAD by using a novel whole organ volumetric high definition CT scanner (16cm z-axis coverage with 256 detector rows and 512 slices, gantry rotation time 0.28 sec), were enrolled in the study. Prospective ECG-triggering was used in all patients, of whom 20 with double-shot technique and the remaining 29 with single-shot technique. In all patients, image quality score (by a 4-point Likert scale on a per-segment level) and coronary interpretability were evaluated and the effective dose (ED) was recorded. Result(s): The mean HR during the scan was 87.7+/-22 bpm. The overall image quality was very high (Likert=3.4+/-1.2, excellent image quality=451 segments, good=206 segments, adequate=90 segments, poor/non diagnostic=19 segments). The overall coronary interpretability was 97.5% (747/766 segments); in patients performed with double-shot technique, the interpretability was 96.4%, whereas we found an interpretability of 98.4% with single-shot technique. The overall mean ED was 4.6+/-2.1 mSv, while a significantly lower dose (3.6+/-1.5 mSv) was measured for single-shot technique vs. double-shot approach (5.9+/-2.1 mSv, p<0.01). Conclusion(s): The novel whole organ high definition CT scanner allows to evaluate coronary arteries with high image quality and coronary interpretability and low radiation exposure in patients with atrial fibrillation and high HR during the scan.",Excluded
952,"Interventional Radiology Image-Guided Suprapubic Cystostomy Using Trocar versus Seldinger Technique: A Comparative Analysis of Outcomes and Complications. Objective: To compare two techniques-trocar and Seldinger-for performing percutaneous suprapubic cystostomy. Materials And Methods: 125 patients, mean age 71.8 +/- 16.5 years (range, 15-102 years), underwent primary suprapubic cystostomy from January 2013 to December 2018. Trocar access (N = 60) was performed as a single step using a puncture cannula without guidewire access. Seldinger access (N = 65) involved needle puncture, guidewire placement, and serial dilation. A retrospective review of patient records was conducted. Result(s): All procedures were technically successful. Mean catheter size was 13.1 +/- 2.0 and 13.9 +/- 2.0 French for trocar and Seldinger, respectively (P =.044). Mean procedure time was significantly reduced using trocar technique, 12.4 +/- 7.7 versus 25.7 +/- 12.1 minutes (P <.001), and was associated with lower anxiolytic dose, 1.2 +/- 0.8 versus 1.9 +/- 1.1 mg midazolam (P =.003), and less radiation exposure, 20.2 +/- 59.5 versus 100.7 +/- 98.5 mGy (P <.001). Catheter occlusion was the most common complication (28.8%), followed by UTI (13.6%) and bladder spasm (8.0%). All but 2 complications were classified as Clavien-Dindo grade I or II. Catheter occlusion was more frequent in the trocar group (41.7% vs 16.9%, P =.003), while bladder spasms were more frequent in the Seldinger group (13.8% vs 1.7%, P =.018). Conclusion(s): Suprapubic cystostomy via trocar is associated with faster procedure time, lower anxiolytic dose, and less radiation. While major complications are rare, catheter occlusion is a common occurrence that may be overlooked. Although we detected more occlusions with trocar technique, this may be confounded by a catheter-tract size discrepancy.Copyright © 2020",Excluded
3106,"Commercial sunscreen formulations: UVB irradiation stability and effect on UVB irradiation-induced skin oxidative stress and inflammation. Evidence shows that sunscreens undergo degradation processes induced by UV irradiation forming free radicals, which reduces skin protection. In this regard, the biological effects of three commercial sunscreen formulations upon UVB irradiation in the skin were investigated. The three formulations had in common the presence of benzophenone-3 added with octyl methoxycinnamate or octyl salycilate or both, which are regular UV filters in sunscreens. The results show that formulations F1 and F2 presented partial degradation upon UVB irradiation. Formulations F1 and F2 presented higher skin penetration profiles than F3. None of the formulations avoided UVB irradiation-induced GSH depletion, but inhibited reduction of SOD activity, suggesting the tested formulations did not present as a major mechanism inhibiting all UVB irradiation-triggered oxidative stress pathways. The formulations avoided the increase of myeloperoxidase activity and cytokine production (IL-1beta and TNF-alpha), but with different levels of protection in relation to the IL-1beta release. Concluding, UVB irradiation can reduce the stability of sunscreens, which in turn, present the undesirable properties of reaching viable skin. Additionally, the same SPF does not mean that different sunscreens will present the same biological effects as SPF is solely based on a skin erythema response. This found opens up perspectives to consider additional studies to reach highly safe sunscreens. Copyright © 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",Excluded

Thyroid volume has been reported as one of the factors influencing radioiodine therapy outcome in man and cats. The goal of this study was to describe the most reliable and practically applicable formula to determine thyroid volume using scintigraphy. The volume of each thyroid lobe of 32 hyperthyroid cats was determined by ultrasound and scintigraphy. The ultrasonographically determined volume (ellipsoid formula) for each thyroid lobe was compared with the scintigraphic volume that was calculated using eight different formulas: F1 [(pi/6) x L x H x W], F2 [(pi /2) x L x W(2)], F3 [0.33 x (area cm(2))(3/2)], F4 [1.08 x (pi /6) x L x W(2)], F5 (area x H), F6 (0.27 x area x L), F7 (pi x L x W(2)) and F8 [pi x (4/3) x W(3)]. F1, F3, F4 and F6 did not differ statistically from the volumes measured on ultrasound, while F2, F5, F7 and F8 did. Subjective shape assessment of the thyroid lobes, assigned as cylindrical or spherical, and the use of corresponding formulas, did not appear to be useful.",Excluded
1252,"Reduced intensity VEPEMB regimen compared with standard ABVD in elderly Hodgkin lymphoma patients: Results from a randomized trial on behalf of the Fondazione Italiana Linfomi (FIL). Survival rates for elderly Hodgkin Lymphoma (HL) have not improved substantially in recent years, mainly because of a lack of prospective randomized studies, due to difficulties in enrolling patients. Between 2002 and 2006, 54 untreated HL patients, aged between 65 and 80 years and considered 'non-frail' according to a comprehensive geriatric evaluation, were enrolled into a phase III randomized trial to compare a reduced-intensity regimen (vinblastine, cyclophosphamide, procarbazine, prednisone, etoposide, mitoxantrone, bleomycin; VEPEMB) with standard ABVD (adriamycin, bleomycin, vinblastine, dacarbazine). Primary endpoint was progression-free survival (PFS). Seventeen patients were in early stage (I-IIA), while 37 were advanced stage. Median age was 72 years and median follow-up was 76 months. Five-year PFS rates were 48% vs. 70% [adjusted Hazard ratio (HR) = 2.19, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.94-5.10, P = 0.068] and 5-year overall survival (OS) rates were 63% vs. 77% (adjusted HR = 1.67, 95% CI = 0.69-4.03, P = 0.254) for VEPEMB compared to ABVD. Overall treatment-related mortality was 4%. World Health Organization grade 4 cardiac and lung toxicity occurred in four patients treated with ABVD versus no cases in the VEPEMB arm. Standard ABVD regimen resulted in better PFS and OS than the VEPEMB, although the differences were not statistically significant. The low toxicity of both treatments was probably attributable to stringent selection of patients based on a Comprehensive Geriatric Assessment that excluded frail patients.Copyright © 2016 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",Excluded
2054,"Novel use of ultrasound guidance for recanalization of iliac, femoral, and popliteal arteries. OBJECTIVES: We attempted to demonstrate the safety and feasibility of intravascular ultrasound (IVUS)-guided endluminal endovascular therapy for chronic total occlusion (CTO) of the iliac and/or femoropopliteal arteries using Treasure 12, a stiff guidewire for peripheral CTO of 0.018 in. in monodirectional approach setting., BACKGROUND: Endovascular therapy for CTO of the iliac and femoropopliteal arteries is still technically challenging., METHODS: Endovascular therapy was performed in 110 patients who were admitted to Hyogo College of Medicine Hospital with iliac and/or femoropopliteal artery disease from January 2006 to October 2007. We retrospectively analyzed the data of consecutive 47 patients who underwent the endovascular therapy by monodirectional approach for CTO lesions of the iliac and femoropopliteal arteries. From January 2006 to November 2006 (phase 1), standard technique was applied for the treatment of 21 lesions. From December 2006 to October 2007 (phase 2), IVUS-guided endovascular therapy was applied for the treatment of 31 lesions., RESULTS: Clinical and lesion characteristics in phase 1 were not significantly different from those in phase 2. The overall initial technical success rate improved from 81% in phase 1 to 97% in phase 2. There were no significant differences in radiation exposure time between phase 1 and phase 2. Total volume of contrast material was significantly smaller in phase 2 than in phase 1 (P < 0.01)., CONCLUSIONS: The IVUS-guided endovascular therapy for CTO using Treasure 12 guidewire is feasible and safe, minimizes contrast material, and has a high initial technical success rate.

Objective: To evaluate the feasibility of postoperative intensity-modulated radiotherapy for head and neck cancer by investigating the patterns of failure after this therapy. Method(s): A retrospective chart review was performed. Result(s): Between March 2006 and December 2013, 122 consecutive patients with head and neck squamous cell carcinoma were treated by surgery followed by postoperative intensity-modulated radiotherapy. In regard to the site of the primary tumor, 59 (48%) patients had cancer of the oral cavity, 31 (26%) patients had cancer of the hypopharynx, 14 (11%) patients had cancer of the oropharynx, 10 (8%) patients had cancer of the larynx and 8 (7%) patients had cancer of unknown primary. The median follow-up period of the surviving patients was 54 months (range, 25-115). Concurrent chemotherapy was administered in 76 patients (62%). The median prescribed radiation dose was 66 Gy. The 3-year overall survival, progression-free survival, distant metastasis free survival and loco-regional control rates were 59%, 48%, 52.4% and 71%, respectively. Of the 122 patients, 32 developed loco-regional recurrence as the initial recurrence, including in-field recurrence in 26 patients, marginal recurrence in five patients and out-field recurrence in seven patients. Of the five patients with marginal recurrence, four have had two or more surgeries before the intensity-modulated radiotherapy and three had oral cavity cancer. Severe adverse events were not frequent, occurring at a frequency of <5%, except for mucositis. No severe toxicities associated with the flap reconstruction were observed either.

Oesophageal cancer, a disease with high morbidity and mortality, has a relatively high incidence in eastern India, usually presenting at advanced stage. The main aim of treatment for majority of patients remains palliation of dysphagia, which can be effectively done by intraluminal brachytherapy with or without external radiotherapy. Between January 2006 to January 2010 a total of 35 patients with advanced/metastatic (24/35) or recurrent (11/35) oesophageal carcinoma were treated with intraluminalhigh dose rate (HDR) iridium192 source brachytherapy at Medical College Hospitals, Kolkata. Selection for palliative brachytherapy includes one or more of the following criteria: Lesion more than 5 cm long on imaging studies or upper GI endoscopy, Karnofsky performance status <50%, Locoregional recurrence. Palliative external radiotherapy (20Gy/5# or 30 Gy/10#) was given to 11 patients (31.42%) before brachytherapy. All patients treated with 2 fractions of high dose rate-intraluminal brachytherapy (HDRILRT) one week apart with 600 cGy per fraction at 1 cm off axis. Thirty-five patients were treated with palliative HDR-ILRT. Significant improvement in swallowing status was seen in 20 patients (57.14%) since just after treatment up to 7.5 months. However, 9 patients (25.71%) showed no improvement, and 6 patients (17.14%) showed no changes in dysphagia scoring. Only 3 patients developed ulceration and 2 developed fistula immediately after treatment and 5 patients developed stricture. Median dysphagiafree survival was 6 months.

366,"A new recombined double low restorer line for the Ogu-INRA cms in rapeseed (Brassica napus L.). A major objective of breeders using the Ogu-INRA cytoplasmic male sterility (cms) system in rapeseed (Brassica napus L.) is to obtain double low restorer lines with a shorter introgression and a good agronomic value. The development of low glucosinolate content (low GC) restorer lines often occurs through the deletion of a part of the introgression. One of these lines has lost the radish Pgi-2 allele expression, without recovering that of the rapeseed Pgi-2 allele. This line shows a defect in the meiotic transmission of the restorer gene Rfo and a very poor agronomic value. We initiated a programme to force non-spontaneous recombination between this Rfo-carrying introgression and the rapeseed homologous chromosome from a low GC B. napus line. Gamma ray irradiation was used to induce chromosome breakage just prior meiosis aiming at just such a recombination. Low GC cms plants were crossed with the pollen of irradiated plants that were heterozygous for this introgression. The F 2 families were scored for their vigour, transmission rate of Rfo and female fertility. One family of plants, R2000, showed an improved behaviour for these three traits. This family presented a unique combination of molecular markers when compared to other rapeseed restorers analysed, which suggests that the recombination event allowed the recovery of B. oleracea genetic information that was originally replaced by the radish introgression in the original restorers. This resulted in a duplicated region (originating from radish and B. oleracea) on the chromosome carrying the introgression in the R2000 family. © Springer-Verlag 2005.",Excluded

Objective: To investigate the value of lung perfusion single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) scans in patients with stage III non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) treated with three dimensional conformal radiotherapy (3DCRT). Method(s): Eight patients with stage III NSCLC who were candidated for 3DCRT were enrolled. All the patients had PET-CT scans and SPECT scans. The imagings were accurately co-registered in the planning system. The PET-CT images were used to define the gross tumor volume, and the SPECT images were used to define a volume of perfused ""functioning"" lung (FL). The planning objective was to minimize the dose to FL. Statistical analysis was made for the difference between the two sets of 3DCRT plans. Result(s): After 3DCRT was optimized, both the percentage of whole lung volume received dose >=xGy (WLVx) and the percentage of functional lung volume received dose >=xGy (FLVx) were decreased. However, the FLVx was decreased significantly. There were significant differences in WLV10, WLV15, WLV20, WLV25, WLV30 and FLV10, FLV15, FLV20, FLV25, FLV30 between before and after the 3DCRT was optimized (P=0.001, 0.002, 0.014, 0.046, 0.017 and 0.000, 0.000, 0.004, 0.027, 0.023).

Background: During the follow-up visits after Adult Spine Deformity (ASD) surgery, obtaining surveillance radiographs is a usual practice, and this study tried to identify evidence to support or refute such practice. Method(s): This is a retrospective, diagnostic case series (Level IV) of 49 patients. We identified the abnormal radiographic findings and their association with need for revision surgery. We determined the odds of obtaining an abnormal radiographs that lead to revision surgery at each of the given time intervals of follow-up. We also estimated the risk versus benefit of obtaining radiographs at each of the given time intervals of follow-up. Result(s): We identified a total of 11 individual types of abnormal postoperative radiographic findings. Of them, the two radiographic findings that always needed revision surgery because of the associated clinical presentation were pedicle screw pullout and bilateral rod fracture. One abnormal radiographic finding that was never associated with revision surgery was the halo around a pedicle screw. In each of the given postoperative time intervals of follow-up at which the routine radiographs were obtained, we noted that the odds of noticing abnormal radiographic finding that lead to revision surgery was always >1. We found that the cumulative hazard rate for exposure to radiation was significantly higher during the initial follow-up visits when compared to subsequent follow-up visits. Conclusion(s): This study finds evidence to support the practice of routine postoperative radiographic evaluation of patients who come for follow-up after ASD surgery.Copyright © 2018 Scoliosis Research Society",Excluded

PURPOSE: To evaluate functional results and corneal changes after femtosecond laser correction of presbyopia (INTRACOR, Technolas Perfect Vision GmbH) in emmetropes using a modified treatment pattern over a 12-month period., METHODS: Twenty eyes from 20 emmetropic patients were treated with a modified intrastromal INTRACOR pattern consisting of 5 central rings and 8 radial cuts in a prospective, nonrandomized, uncontrolled, open, single-center, clinical study. Refraction, visual acuity, endothelial cell density, corneal pachymetry, total corneal power, and stray light were evaluated preoperatively and 1 (except endothelial cell density and stray light), 3, 6, and 12 months postoperatively. Patients filled out a subjective questionnaire at 12 months postoperatively., RESULTS: Comparison of preoperative versus 12-month postoperative median values revealed a significant improvement in uncorrected near visual acuity (UNVA) from 0.60 (20/80) to 0.10 logMAR (20/25) (P<.0001) and a significant decrease in corrected distance visual acuity (CDVA) from -0.10 (20/16) to 0.00 logMAR (20/20), which equals a median loss of one line (P=.0005). Fifteen percent of patients lost two lines of CDVA in the treated eye. Subjective spherical equivalent refraction remained unchanged at 0.00 diopters (D) (P=.194). After INTRACOR treatment, significant corneal steepening of 1.40 D and midperipheral flattening of 0.50 D occurred (both P<.0001). Corneal pachymetry at the thinnest point and endothelial cell density did not change significantly (P=.829 and P=.058, respectively)., CONCLUSIONS: After 12 months, the modified INTRACOR pattern improved UNVA in emmetropic patients without inducing a myopic shift or significant changes in endothelial cell density or pachymetry.

3198,"Real-time magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) during active wrist motion--initial observations. BACKGROUND: Non-invasive imaging techniques such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) provide the ability to evaluate the complex anatomy of bone and soft tissues of the wrist without the use of ionizing radiation. Dynamic instability of wrist--occurring during joint motion--is a complex condition that has assumed increased importance in musculoskeletal medicine. The objective of this study was to develop an MRI protocol for evaluating the wrist during continuous active motion, to show that dynamic imaging of the wrist is realizable, and to demonstrate that the resulting anatomical images enable the measurement of metrics commonly evaluated for dynamic wrist instability., METHODS: A 3-Tesla ""active-MRI"" protocol was developed using a bSSFP sequence with 475 ms temporal resolution for continuous imaging of the moving wrist. Fifteen wrists of 10 asymptomatic volunteers were scanned during active supination/pronation, radial/ulnar deviation, ""clenched-fist"", and volarflexion/dorsiflexion maneuvers. Two physicians evaluated distal radioulnar joint (DRUJ) congruity, extensor carpi ulnaris (ECU) tendon translation, the scapholunate (SL) interval, and the SL, radiolunate (RL) and capitolunate (CL) angles from the resulting images., RESULTS: The mean DRUJ subluxation ratio was 0.04 in supination, 0.10 in neutral, and 0.14 in pronation. The ECU tendon was subluxated or translated out of its groove in 3 wrists in pronation, 9 wrists in neutral, and 11 wrists in supination. The mean SL interval was 1.43 mm for neutral, ulnar deviation, radial deviation positions, and increased to 1.64 mm during the clenched-fist maneuver. Measurement of SL, RL and CL angles in neutral and dorsiflexion was also accomplished., CONCLUSION: This study demonstrates the initial performance of active-MRI, which may be useful in the investigation of dynamic wrist instability in vivo.",Excluded

Purpose: In this prospective trial we compared ultralow dose computerized tomography reconstruction algorithms and routine low dose computerized tomography for detecting urolithiasis., Materials and Methods: A total of 48 consenting adults prospectively underwent routine low dose noncontrast computerized tomography immediately followed by an ultralow dose series targeted at a 70% to 90% reduction from the routine low dose technique (sub mSv range). Ultralow dose series were reconstructed with filtered back projection, and adaptive statistical and model based iterative reconstruction techniques. Transverse (axial) and coronal images were sequentially reviewed by 3 relatively inexperienced trainees, including a radiology resident, a urology fellow and an abdominal imaging fellow. Three experienced abdominal radiologists independently reviewed the routine low dose filtered back projection images, which served as the reference standard., Results: The mean effective dose for the ultralow dose scans was 0.91 mSv (median 0.82), representing a mean+/-SD 78%+/-5% decrease compared to the routine low dose. Overall sensitivity and positive predictive value per stone for ultralow dose computerized tomography at a 4 mm threshold was 0.91 and 0.98, respectively. Sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values, and accuracy per patient were 0.87, 1.00, 1.00, 0.94 and 0.96, respectively. At a 4 mm threshold the sensitivity and positive predictive value per stone of the ultralow dose series for filtered back projection, and adaptive statistical and model based iterative reconstruction was 0.89 and 0.96, 0.91 and 0.98, and 0.93 and 1.00, respectively. Sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values, and accuracy per patient at the 4 mm threshold were 0.82, 1.00, 1.00, 0.91 and 0.94 for filtered back projection, 0.85, 1.00, 1.00, 0.93 and 0.95 for adaptive statistical iterative reconstruction, and 0.94, 1.00, 1.00, 0.97 and 0.98 for model based iterative reconstruction, respectively. Sequential review of coronal images changed the final stone reading in 13% of cases and improved diagnostic confidence in 49%., Conclusions: At a 4 mm renal calculus size threshold ultralow dose computerized tomography is accurate for detection when referenced against routine low dose series with dose reduction to below the level of a typical 2-view plain x-ray of the kidneys, ureters and bladder. Slight differences were seen among the reconstruction algorithms. There was mild improvement with model based iterative reconstruction over filtered back projection and adaptive statistical iterative reconstruction.

557,"Assessment of the degradation rates and effectiveness of different coated Mg-Zn-Ca alloy scaffolds for in vivo repair of critical-size bone defects. Surgical repair of bone defects remains challenging, and the search for alternative procedures is ongoing. Devices made of Mg for bone repair have received much attention owing to their good biocompatibility and mechanical properties. We developed a new type of scaffold made of a Mg-Zn-Ca alloy with a shape that mimics cortical bone and can be filled with morselized bone. We evaluated its durability and efficacy in a rabbit ulna-defect model. Three types of scaffold-surface coating were evaluated: group A, no coating; group B, a 10-mum microarc oxidation coating; group C, a hydrothermal duplex composite coating; and group D, an empty-defect control. X-ray and micro-computed tomography(micro-CT) images were acquired over 12 weeks to assess ulnar repair. A mechanical stress test indicated that bone repair within each group improved significantly over time (P < 0.01). The degradation behavior of the different scaffolds was assessed by micro-CT and quantified according to the amount of hydrogen gas generated; these measurements indicated that the group C scaffold better resisted corrosion than did the other scaffold types (P < 0.05). Calcein fluorescence and histology revealed that greater mineral densities and better bone responses were achieved for groups B and C than for group A, with group C providing the best response. In conclusion, our Mg-Zn-Ca-alloy scaffold effectively aided bone repair. The group C scaffold exhibited the best corrosion resistance and osteogenesis properties, making it a candidate scaffold for repair of bone defects.",Excluded

Moreover, earlier studies have suggested improved survival with addition of cisplatin-based chemotherapy (CT). We present here the results of combined treatment with induction and concomitant CT and accelerated hyperfractionated RT in a retrospective series of patients with advanced NSCLC. Between August 1990 and August 1995, 90 consecutive patients, aged 42-77 years (median 63 years), with locally advanced unresectable or medically inoperable NSCLC and good performance status were referred for treatment: stage: I 23%, IIIa 37%, IIIb 40%. Patients histologies included: squamous cell carcinoma 52%, adenocarcinoma 34% and large cell carcinoma 13%. The treatment consisted of two courses of CT (cisplatin 100 mg/m2 day 1 and etoposide 100 mg/m2 day 1- 3 i.v.), the second course given concomitantly with RT. The total RT dose was 61.2-64.6 Gy, with two daily fractions of 1.7 Gy. A one-week interval was introduced after 40.8 Gy to reduce acute toxicity, making the total treatment time 4.5 weeks. Concerning toxicity, 33 patients had febrile neutropenia, 10 patients suffered from grade III oesophagitis and 7 patients had grade III pneumonitis. There were two possible treatment-related deaths, one due to myocardial infarction and the other due to a pneumocystis carinii infection. The 1-, 2- and 3-year overall survival rates were 72%, 46% and 34%, respectively; median survival was 21.3 months. Fifty-one patients had progressive disease: 21 failed locoregionally, 29 had distant metastases and 9 patients had a combination of these. Pretreatment weight loss was the only prognostic factor found, except for stage. However, the results for stage IIIb were no different from those for stage IIIa. We conclude that the survival results compare favourably with those of most other studies with a manageable toxicity.",Excluded
1443,"Polarization Variability in Age-related Macular Degeneration. SIGNIFICANCE: Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is a leading cause of irreversible vision loss. Complementary imaging techniques can be used to better characterize and quantify pathological changes associated with AMD. By assessing specific light-tissue interactions, polarization-sensitive imaging can be used to detect tissue disruption early in the disease process., PURPOSE: The aim of this study was to compare variability in central macular polarization properties in patients with nonexudative AMD and age-matched control subjects., METHODS: A scanning laser polarimeter (GDx, LDT/CZM) was used to acquire 15 x 15-degree macular images in 10 subjects diagnosed with nonexudative AMD and 10 age-matched control subjects. The coefficient of variation (COV, SD/mean) was used to quantify variability in pixel intensity in the central 3.3degree of the macula for custom images emphasizing multiply scattered light (the depolarized light image) and polarization-retaining light (the maximum of the parallel detector image). The intensity COV was compared across subject categories using paired t tests for each image type., RESULTS: The COV in the central macula was significantly higher in the AMD subject group (average, 0.221; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.157 to 0.265) when compared with matched control subjects (average 0.120; 95% CI, 0.107 to 0.133) in the depolarized light image (P = .01). The COV in the maximum of the parallel detector image was not statistically different between the two subject groups (AMD average, 0.162 [95% CI, 0.138 to 0.185]; control average, 0.137 [95% CI, 0.115 to 0.158]; P = .21)., CONCLUSIONS: Variability in multiply scattered light is higher than that of light that is more polarization preserving in patients with nonexudative AMD. Multiple scattering may act as an early indicator representing disruption to the macula in early AMD.",Excluded
91,"Cyberknife treatment for advanced or terminal stage hepatocellular carcinoma. AIM: To investigate the safety and efficacy of the Cyberknife treatment for patients with advanced or terminal stage hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC)., METHODS: Patients with HCC with extrahepatic metastasis or vascular or bile duct invasion were enrolled between May 2011 and June 2015. The Cyberknife was used to treat each lesion. Treatment response scores were based on Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors v1.1. The trends of tumor markers, including alpha fetoprotein (AFP) and proteins induced by vitamin K absence II (PIVKA II) were assessed. Prognostic factors for tumor response and tumor markers were evaluated with Fisher's exact test and a logistic regression model. Survival was evaluated with the Kaplan-Meier method and multivariate analysis was performed using the Cox proportional hazards model., RESULTS: Sixty-five patients with 95 lesions were enrolled. Based on the Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer classification, all patients were either in the advanced or terminal stage of the disease. The target lesions were as follows: 52 were bone metastasis; 9, lung metastasis; 7, brain metastasis; 9, portal vein invasion; 4, hepatic vein invasion; 4, bile duct invasion; and 10 other lesion types. The response rate and disease control rate were 34% and 53%, respectively. None of the clinical factors correlated significantly with tumor response. Fiducial marker implantation was associated with better control of both AFP (HR = 0.152; 95%CI: 0.026-0.887; P = 0.036) and PIVKA II (HR = 0.035; 95%CI: 0.003-0.342; P = 0.004). The median survival time was 9 mo (95%CI: 5-15 mo). Terminal stage disease (HR = 9.809; 95%CI: 2.589-37.17, P < 0.001) and an AFP of more than 400 ng/mL (HR = 2.548; 95%CI: 1.070-6.068, P = 0.035) were associated with worse survival. A radiation dose higher than 30 Gy (HR = 0.274; 95%CI: 0.093-0.7541, P = 0.012) was associated with better survival. In the 52 cases of bone metastasis, 36 patients (69%) achieved pain relief. One patient had cerebral bleeding and another patient had an esophageal ulcer after treatment., CONCLUSION: The Cyberknife can be safely administered to patients with advanced or terminal stage HCC. High AFP levels were associated with worse survival, but a higher radiation dose improved the survival.",Excluded
993,"Clinical Spectrum and Outcomes of Ocular and Periocular Complications following External-Beam Radiotherapy for Inoperable Malignant Maxillary Sinus Tumors. Purpose: To highlight the clinical spectrum, management, and outcomes of ocular/periocular complications following high-dose external-beam radiotherapy (EBRT) for inoperable malignant maxillary sinus-involving tumors (MMST). Method(s): A retrospective, interventional case series. All patients who were diagnosed with inoperable MMST (with orbital involvement) and treated with high-dose fractionated EBRT (65 Gy in 30 fractions) at James Cook University Hospital, UK, were included. Result(s): Seven patients with advanced MMST (T4aN0M0-T4bN2cM0) were included and were followed up for 23.8 +/- 10.2 months. Severe lid margin disease, dry eye, and neurotrophic keratopathy were universally observed. Other complications included cicatricial conjunctivitis (71%), corneal perforation (57%), limbal stem cell deficiency (LSCD; 43%), glaucoma (29%), and superimposed candida keratitis (14%). Amniotic membrane transplant (AMT; 71%), tarsorrhaphy (43%), tectonic keratoplasty (29%), and evisceration (14%) were warranted. Intact corneal epithelium was observed in all patients and good corrected-distance visual acuity (>=20/60) was observed in 3 (43%) patients at final follow-up. Conclusion(s): High-dose EBRT for inoperable MMST can lead to a wide array of severe ocular/periocular complications. AMT serves as a potentially useful treatment modality to restore the ocular surface integrity after severe radiation keratopathy. We advocate active monitoring for any evolving ophthalmic complications during and after EBRT to enable timely intervention.Copyright © 2020 S. Karger AG, Basel.",Excluded
3423,"Thermoradiotherapy of patients with locally advanced carcinoma of the rectum. The effectiveness of local hyperthermia was investigated in 56 patients with locally advanced carcinoma of the rectum (T4N0M0). All received combined heat and radiation therapy as a pre-operative treatment. The control group consisted of 59 patients with the same stage of disease as those who were only irradiated. Both groups of patients underwent the same surgical procedure. The total tumour dose of ionizing radiation was 40 Gy in 10 fractions, three times a week. The tumour was heated four or five times to a maximum of 42-43 degrees C by electromagnetic waves with a frequency of 905 MHz before irradiation. Each heating session lasted 60 min. Patients were selected on the principle of randomization: 16.1% of patients (n = 9; n: actual number of patients) showed complete response and 53.6% (n = 30) showed significant regression of the primary tumour compared with 1.7% (n = 1) and 33.9% (n = 20) in the control group, respectively. The differences were significant (p less than 0.05). It was found that thermoradiotherapy allowed the 5-year survival rate of patients to increase up to 35.6% (n = 12) compared with 6.6% (n = 7) in the control group (p less than 0.05).",Excluded
1087,"Patient doses from X-ray computed tomography examinations by a single-array detector unit: Axial versus spiral mode. Background: X-ray computed tomography (CT) examinations deliver a significant amount of radiation doses to patients comparing to conventional radiography examinations. The objective of the current study was to analyze and investigate the average patient received dose from axial and spiral CT exams in a medical imaging center. Material(s) and Method(s): In this study, the patient imaging technique, weight and height were recorded. The patients' doses provided by CT unit in terms of CTDIw were also recorded. Then, other dosimetric quantities including dose-length product (DLP) and effective dose were calculated for each patient using the recorded data. The average values were obtained for all the studied dosimetric quantities. Also, their distribution in terms of examined regions and imaging mode; ie, axial and spiral CT were analyzed by SPSS software. Result(s): For all patients, the mean effective dose of 4.4 mGy with the standard deviation of 9.2 was found. The CTDIw for axial group was two times higher than spiral ones. Conversely, the effective dose of axial group was less than spiral group. Additionally, the effective doses of 2.3 and 5.2 mSv were found for axial and spiral, receptively. For both quantities of CTDIw and effective dose, the observed difference between axial and spiral modes were significant (P<0.001). Conclusion(s): Our results showed that although the patient doses in the current study was comparable with the reported values by similar studies in other countries, it was higher than the reported values of a similar study in Iran.

3108,"Avelumab-cetuximab-radiotherapy versus standards of care in locally advanced squamous-cell carcinoma of the head and neck: The safety phase of a randomised phase III trial GORTEC 2017-01 (REACH). Background: Based on the hypothesis of synergistic effect of avelumab with cetuximab and radiotherapy, this new combination is tested in a randomised trial against two well-established standard of care (SOC) in locally advanced squamous-cell carcinoma of the head and neck (LA-SCCHN). Method(s): This phase III trial comprises two cohorts of patients deemed fit to receive cisplatin (100 mg/m2 Q3W) (cohort 1) or unfit to cisplatin (cohort 2). The SOC was Intensity Modulated Radiation Therapy (IMRT) with cisplatin in cohort 1 (arm A) and with weekly cetuximab in cohort 2 (arm D). In both cohorts, experimental arms (arms B and C) were IMRT with cetuximab and avelumab (10 mg/kg day 7 and every 2 weeks) followed by avelumab every two weeks for 12 months. A safety phase was planned among the first 41 patients in experimental arms by monitoring grade >=IV adverse events (AEs) with an unacceptable rate of 35%. Result(s): Between September 2017 and August 2018, 82 patients with LA-SCCHN were randomised including 41 patients in experimental arms. All patients of experimental arms except one (arm C) received entire radiotherapy as planned. Most common grade >=III AEs were mucositis, radio-dermatitis, and dysphagia. Grade >=IV AEs occurred in 5/41 (12%) patients, all in arm C (no grade V). This rate was acceptable according to the hypotheses of the safety phase. In the SOC arms, grade >=IV AEs occurred in 3/21 patients (14%) in arm A and 2/20 (10%) in arm D. One grade V haemorrhage occurred in arm A. Conclusion(s): The avelumab-cetuximab-RT combination was tolerable for patients with LA-SCCHN, and the approval was given for continuing the trial without modification.

3520,"Radiation therapy for extramammary paget disease: Treatment outcomes and prognostic factors. Purpose/Objective(s): Extramammary Paget disease (EMPD) is a relatively rare cutaneous malignancy that primarily affects the genital regions, such as the vulva and scrotum, of the elderly. Although wide surgical excision is the standard curative treatment for EMPD, it is frequently unsuitable due to old age or severe coexisting disease. Radiation therapy is considered a possible treatment option for these patients, but to date there have been few studies that have presented treatment results. Consequently, we have investigated the outcome of radiation therapy in EMPD. Materials/Methods: Thirty-six patients with EMPD received radiation therapy with curative intent. Of these patients, 13 were men and 23 were women, and their median age at irradiation was 74 years (range, 52-94 years). The primary tumor sites were the perineum in 13 patients, vulva in 12, scrotum in 10, and penis in one. Twelve patients had regional lymph node metastases prior to radiation therapy, but none had distant metastasis. Total radiation doses of 45-80.2 Gy (median, 60 Gy) were delivered to tumor sites in 23-43 fractions (median, 33 fractions) with fraction sizes of 1.8-2.2 Gy (median, 1.8 Gy). Result(s): All irradiated tumors had disappeared macroscopically by 2-9 months after irradiation, and the initial complete response rate was 100%. However, 14 of the 36 patients developed recurrences, including four with local progression within the radiation field and 11 with lymph node or/and distant metastases outside the radiation field, during follow-up periods of 2-150 months (median, 40 months). All but one of the 11 patients with regional lymph node or distant metastases after irradiation exhibited tumor invasion into the dermis, whereas of the 15 patients without tumor invasion into the dermis, none had regional lymph node metastasis and only one had distant metastasis after irradiation. The local progression-free and diseasefree rates were 86% and 53%, respectively at 3 years and 86% and 45%, respectively at 5 years. Nine patients died at 6-73 months after irradiation; the causes of death were tumor progression in five patients, infectious pneumonia in two, renal failure in one and old age in one. The overall and cause-specific survival rates were 93% and 95%, respectively at 3 years and 61% and 80%, respectively at 5 years. Tumor invasion into the dermis was a statistically significant prognostic factor for both distant metastasis (p = 0.004) and survival (p = 0.005). No therapy-related toxicities of grade 3 or greater were observed. Conclusion(s): Radiation therapy was found to be safe and effective for patients with EMPD. It appeared to contribute to prolonged survival through good tumor control, and to be a promising curative treatment option.",Excluded
406,"Increased metabolic activity in the spinal cord of patients with long-standing Lhermitte's sign. PURPOSE: To investigate the pathophysiology of the radiation-induced, chronic Lhermitte's sign (LS) on the basis of long-standing case histories with partial functional recovery., PATIENTS AND METHODS: As radiotherapy in two nasopharyngeal cancer patients, a biologically effective dose (BED) of 103.8 Gy(2) (case 1) and 94.8 Gy(2) (case 2) was delivered to the cervical spinal cord. Neurologic signs relating to the irradiated spinal cord segments developed after 2 months (case 1) and 5 years (case 2), with radiation-induced damage equivalent to grade 3 (case 1) and grade 2 (case 2) toxicity (Common Toxicity Criteria, Version 2.0). The clinical status improved to grade 2 (case 1) and grade 1 (case 2). Positron emission tomography (PET) and fibroblast clonogen assay were applied 25 and 7 years postirradiation, respectively, to characterize this rare clinical picture., RESULTS: PET demonstrated increased [(18)F]fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) accumulation and [(15)O]butanol perfusion, but negligible [(11)C]methionine uptake in the irradiated spinal cord segments in both patients. In clonogenic assays, fibroblasts from case 1 displayed much higher radiation sensitivity than in healthy controls, while in case 2 the fibroblasts sensitivity was normal., CONCLUSIONS: These data suggests a close direct relationship between regional perfusion and metabolism of the spinal cord, similarly as in the brain. The postirradiation recovery may be related to energy-demanding conduction, explaining the increased metabolism and perfusion. The increased radiosensitivity and higher spinal cord BED may have contributed to the more severe sequelae in case 1.",Excluded

BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Determination of the dose-response relations for oesophageal stricture after radiotherapy of the head and neck., MATERIAL AND METHODS: In this study 33 patients who developed oesophageal stricture and 39 patients as controls are included. The patients received radiation therapy for head and neck cancer at Karolinska University Hospital, Stockholm, Sweden. For each patient the 3D dose distribution delivered to the upper 5 cm of the oesophagus was analysed. The analysis was conducted for two periods, 1992-2000 and 2001-2005, due to the different irradiation techniques used. The fitting has been done using the relative seriality model., RESULTS: For the treatment period 1992-2005, the mean doses were 49.8 and 33.4 Gy, respectively, for the cases and the controls. For the period 1992-2000, the mean doses for the cases and the controls were 49.9 and 45.9 Gy and for the period 2001-2005 were 49.8 and 21.4 Gy. For the period 2001-2005 the best estimates of the dose-response parameters are D(50)=61.5 Gy (52.9-84.9 Gy), gamma=1.4 (0.8-2.6) and s=0.1 (0.01-0.3)., CONCLUSIONS: Radiation-induced strictures were found to have a dose response relation and volume dependence (low relative seriality) for the treatment period 2001-2005. However, no dose response relation was found for the complete material. Copyright © 2010 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.",Excluded
1217,"Effect of a proton pump inhibitor on postprandial gastric volume, emptying and symptoms in healthy human subjects: A pilot study. Background: In consensus guidelines, proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) are recommended for the treatment of functional dyspepsia. It is unclear whether PPIs change gastric volume or emptying. Aim(s): To assess the effect of a PPI, rabeprazole, on gastric volume and emptying and postprandial symptoms. Method(s): In a double-blind, parallel-group placebo-controlled trial, 13 healthy participants were randomized to rabeprazole, 20 mg b.d., or placebo. On day 3, fasting gastric volume was measured using intravenous 99mTc- pertechnate and single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT). After the last dose of study medication, an 111In-chloride egg meal (300 kcal) was ingested, and postprandial gastric volume and emptying were measured by SPECT. Symptom ratings using a visual analogue scale (fullness, nausea, bloating, abdominal pain, aggregate score) were obtained at baseline and 15, 30, 45, 60 and 75 min postprandially. Group comparisons were performed using Mann-Whitney rank sum test. Result(s): There were no statistically significant differences in gastric volume or emptying in the two groups. However, there was a borderline increase in gastric volume with rabeprazole compared with placebo. Rabeprazole treatment reduced aggregate postprandial symptoms, particularly fullness, 30 min after the meal (P = 0.01). Conclusion(s): In healthy participants, rabeprazole, 20 mg b.d., did not significantly change gastric emptying, but reduced symptoms and had a borderline effect on gastric volume postprandially. The mechanism of reduced postprandial symptoms with a PPI requires further study. © 2006 The Authors.",Excluded

Background: We previously described the feasibility of myocardial perfusion imaging (MPI) with nearly half the radiation dose using ordered-subset expectation maximization with resolution recovery (OSEM-RR) processing. This study sought to determine if the findings can be expanded to obese patients. Method(s): Fifty obese patients (>100 kg) referred for MPI underwent stress-rest or rest-stress studies with a half dose of Tc-99m sestamibi in a 1-day protocol using OSEM-RR processing. Image quality and clinical results were compared with matched patients (by age, sex, weight, presence/probability of coronary artery disease) evaluated with standard ""full-dose"" Tc-99m sestamibi, mostly in a 2-day protocol. Dose activities were adjusted individually by weight. Result(s): Mean Tc-99m activity was 33.4 +/- 13.9 mCi in the half-dose group and 60 +/- 10 mCi in the full-dose group (P <.0001). Respective mean effective doses per study were 10 +/- 4 and 18 +/- 3 mSv (P <.0001). Overall image quality was good-to-excellent in 94% of the half-dose group and 80% of the full-dose group (P <.045). There was no between-group difference in rate or size of ischemia or infarction, except for stress left ventricular ejection fraction.

PURPOSE: This study evaluates the difference in damage to middle ear function with CRT and IMRT techniques in the treatment of nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC). We explore the isthmus of the Eustachian tube (ET) as the key anatomic site for the prevention of radiation-induced otitis media with effusion., METHODS AND MATERIALS: Eighty-two patients with NPC were divided into two groups: 40 patients treated with CRT and 42 patients treated with IMRT. The difference between dosage over the middle ear cavity and the isthmus of the ET was evaluated in both CRT group and IMRT group. All patients underwent hearing tests including pure tone audiometry and impedance audiometry before and after RT., RESULTS: The dosage difference to the middle ear cavity and isthmus between these two groups was statistically significant (p<0.05). The difference in hearing test results between these two groups was also statistically significant (p<0.05). If we limited the dose to the middle ear cavity under 34 Gy and the dose to the isthmus under 53 Gy with IMRT, we may decrease radiation-induced OME even with the larger 2.25 Gy fraction size., CONCLUSIONS: IMRT may have better protected the middle ear function compared with the CRT technique, even with larger fraction sizes than for the conventional CRT technique.",Excluded
1041,"Radiation therapy for squamous cell carcinoma of the subglottic larynx. Objective: This study aims to summarize our institution's experience in treating patients with primary subglottic squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) with radiotherapy (RT) and to define the optimal treatment plan for these patients. Method(s): We retrospectively reviewed the medical records of 18 patients with subglottic SCC curatively treated with RT between 1977 and 2009. T1 and T2 cancers were considered early disease; T3 and T4 lesions were considered advanced disease. Patients were stratified according to whether they received RT alone or RT and surgery. Patients treated surgically tended to have more advanced disease and required a total laryngectomy. Patients were excluded if they had distant metastasis at diagnosis or if their tumor was glottic in origin and extended inferiorly into the subglottis. Result(s): Twelve patients (67 %) had advanced disease, and six patients (33 %) had early disease. Local control was achieved in 100 % of the patients with early disease, regardless of treatment group. Of the patients with advanced disease, local control was achieved in five of the seven patients (71 %) treated with RT alone and in four of the five (80 %) treated with surgery and RT. Ultimate local control was achieved in six of the seven patients (86 %) with advanced disease treated with RT alone. Overall local control was 83 % at 5 years, with a 5-year cause-specific survival of 66 % and a 5-year overall survival of 44 %. Local-regional control mirrored that of local control, with an overall local-regional control rate of 83 %. No patient suffered a severe acute or late complication or acute toxicity during the treatment process. Conclusion(s): Patients with SCC of the subglottic larynx have a high likelihood of local-regional control after undergoing RT along or combined with surgery. Those with T1-T2 and low volume T3-T4 cancers have high probability of local control with voice preservation after definitive RT. © 2012 Springer-Verlag.",Excluded
3569,"Prognosis of severe lymphopenia after postoperative radiotherapy in non-small cell lung cancer: Results of a long-term follow up study. Purpose: To investigate the incidence and prognosis of severe radiation-induced lymphopenia (sRIL) after postoperative radiotherapy (PORT) for resected NSCLC. Patients and Methods: Between 1998 and 2017, 170 patients treated with PORT for NSCLC were retrospectively reviewed. Lymphopenia was divided into tertiles with severe lymphopenia defined as absolute lymphocyte counts (ALC) < 0.37 x 103/ul. Result(s): sRIL was observed in 32.3% of patients. Multivariable logistic regression analysis indicated sRIL was associated with planning target volume radiation fraction numbers (OR 1.09, p = 0.005) and total lung mean dose (OR 1.12, p = 0.006). With a median follow-up time of 12.2 years, the median progression-free survival and overall survival were 14.8 months and 28.4 months respectively in patients with sRIL, vs. 21.7 months (p = 0.008) and 48.3 months (p = 0.01) respectively in patients without sRIL. Multivariable analyses indicated sRIL significantly decreased OS (HR 1.95, p < 0.01). Since PORT for stage I-II NSCLC was done largely for positive margins, which may confound the contribution of severe RIL, we analyzed stage III separately and found that sRIL also significantly decreased OS (HR 1.88, p = 0.004) in multivariable analysis. Conclusion(s): For this long-term outcome study, severe RIL correlated with total lung mean dose and radiation fractionation numbers, and was a strong prognostic factor for poor survival in PORT patients, particularly in patients with stage III NSCLC, highlighting the importance of an intact immune system for post-radiation immunologic disease surveillance.Copyright © 2021 The Authors",Excluded
2274,"Determination of netilmicin in rat serum using high performance liquid chromatography and resonance Rayleigh scattering. A method was developed for the direct determination of netilmicin in rat serum using high performance liquid chromatography and resonance Rayleigh scattering (RRS). The separation was carried out on a Cl8 column with the isocratic elution of the mixture of 20 mmol/L sodium acetate aqueous solution and methanol containing 0.22% trifluoroacetic acid (92: 8, v/ v). With the molecular recognition probe of pontamine sky blue, netilmicin formed an ion-association complex and enhanced the intensity of RRS. The RRS signal was detected by a commercial fluorescence detector at 365 nm of both excitation wavelength (lambdaem) and emission wavelength (lambdaex). Under the optimized conditions, the limit of detection (LOD, S/N = 3) for the netilmicin was 0. 7 mg/L. With the internal standard (IS) of tobramycin, a linear calibration curve ranged from 1. 2 mg/L to 30 mg/L was obtained. The presented method can be used for the pharmacokinetics study of netilmicin in rat serum, and can be a new choice for the determination of aminoglycoside antibiotics in biological samples.",Excluded
1645,"Potential Irish dose reference levels for cardiac interventional examinations. Collective dose for cardio-angiography studies is the highest of all non-CT radiological investigations. Deterministic effects such as erythema, epilation and ulceration being reported on patients who have undergone these procedures emphasise the importance of optimising radiation dose, whilst not compromising diagnostic efficacy. This study investigated radiation doses delivered to patients for four common types of cardiac radiological examinations: coronary angiography (CA), percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), coronary angiograms (which were followed by an interventional procedure (CA-PCI)) and permanent pacemaker insertions (PPIs). 21 cardiac imaging suites participated in the study in 14 hospitals, representing 90% of relevant centres within Ireland. Radiation dose was monitored for 1804 adult patients using dose-area product meters. Operational and examination details, such as cardiologist grade, patient details, examination complexity and exposure factors, were recorded for each examination. Variation factors in dose between centres ranged from 2.7 to 11.1, but these factors were not higher than intrahospital variations previously recorded for other examinations within Ireland, such as chest X-ray. High-dose centres were often associated with long screening times, a high patient body mass index and complexity of the procedure. Preliminary dose reference levels (DRLs) were established using rounded third quartile values at 4200 cGy cm(2), 8400 cGy cm(2), 10,700 cGy cm(2) and 2100 cGy cm(2) for CA, PCI, CA-PCI and PPI, respectively. With these commonly performed relatively high-dose procedures, it is important that some guideline values are available to encourage optimised strategies. These proposed DRLs offer such guidance.",Excluded
719,"Staying in bed to benefit ESA's astronauts and Europe's citizens. Since Yuri Gagarin's historic first flight into space in April 1961, it has quickly become evident that the space environment influences the human body in many different ways and causes it to adapt in ways that can lead to problems when returning to Earth's gravity. Much research has been performed in the meantime and our understanding of what happens to our bodies in space improved considerably during the Mir space station and Space Shuttle/Spacelab era. However, many questions, particularly regarding how to counteract those changes that we now know take place, still need to be addressed through studies on the International Space Station (ISS) and through simulations on the ground. As we enter an era in which crews will spend longer periods in space on the ISS and of longer term plans by almost every space-faring nation for missions to Mars, it is clear that much more knowledge is needed, and quickly. Although a few hundred men and women have already travelled into space, the operating environment severely limits the amount of systematic research that can be performed--a situation that is unlikely to change. Other avenues for addressing specific scientific questions in a controlled research environment must therefore be found. One of these complementary alternatives is head-down-tilt bed-rest studies in which volunteers are confined to beds that are tilted -6 deg below the horizontal at the head end. Every activity, including eating, reading, showering, etc., is performed in this position for the duration of the study. This leads to changes in the human body that are very similar to those seen during spaceflight, such as bone-mass and muscle-mass loss, cardiovascular and neuro-sensory deconditioning. The controlled bed-rest setting therefore allows meaningful research into the bodily consequences of spaceflight and possible countermeasures. It also gives the scientific community interested in space-related medical research more ready access to a clinical model. The benefits of these studies go far beyond their space application. Patients bed-ridden because of illness or accidents suffer the same symptoms and can thus also profit from the studies. As a clear indication of this link, the clinicians and researchers involved in the bed-rest campaigns typically spend the majority of their time exploring ""terrestrial"" problems.",Excluded
2311,"Surgical management of osteoradionecrosis of the jaws. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study is to evaluate our 10-year clinical experience in surgical management of patients with osteoradionecrosis (ORN) unresolved with conservative nonoperative treatment., PATIENTS AND METHODS: The medical records of 120 patients who had been surgically treated for ORN during a 10-year period (January 2003 to January 2013) were retrospectively reviewed., RESULTS: The most predilection ORN site was mandible (82.5%), followed by the maxilla (11.7%). ORN developed within initial 12 months in 39.2% and within the first 3 years in 68.3%. The median radiation dose was 68.1 Gy (range, 35-148 Gy), but 51 patients (42.5%) experienced ORN even though radiation doses were controlled under 60 Gy. Surgical trauma, as we believed, was the most important factor leading to this result. Among all the patients, 12 (10.0%) patients were found ineligible for operative treatment due to comorbid systematic diseases whereas none healed or improved. In terms of surgical management of the rest of the 108 patients, 90 (75.0%) patients underwent radical resection (4 patients unhealed), and 18 (15.0%) patients underwent mild surgical procedures such as sequestrectomy or debridement (1 patient unhealed). Of the 90 radical resection patients, 58 patients underwent radical resections and immediate microvascular flap reconstruction (19 bone flaps and 39 soft flaps), and 32 patients only experience radical resection (5 patients received second-stage reconstruction). According to follow-up information, 55 patients were free of disease., CONCLUSION: Though priority should be given to surgical treatment for the patient whose ORN does not respond to conservative nonoperative treatment, we may as well take into account more individualized regimens based on ORN severity. A hard lesson learned from our article is that the oral maxillofacial surgeon should minimize the trauma for jaws as possible as he can, especially to patients who need to receive postoperative radiotherapy.",Excluded

2170,"Standard dose and dose-escalated radiation therapy are associated with favorable survival in select elderly patients with newly diagnosed glioblastoma. We hypothesized elderly patients with good Karnofsky Performance Status (KPS) treated with standard dose or dose-escalated radiation therapy (SDRT/DERT) and concurrent temozolomide (TMZ) would have favorable overall survival (OS) compared to historical elderly patients treated with hypofractionated RT (HFRT). From 2004 to 2015, 66 patients age >= 60 with newly diagnosed, pathologically proven glioblastoma were treated with SDRT/DERT over 30 fractions with concurrent/adjuvant TMZ at a single institution. Kaplan-Meier methods and the log-rank test were used to assess OS and progression-free survival (PFS). Multivariate analysis (MVA) was performed using Cox Proportional-Hazards. Median follow-up was 12.6 months. Doses ranged from 60 to 81 Gy (median 66). Median KPS was 90 (range 60-100) and median age was 67 years (range 60-81), with 29 patients >= 70 years old. 32% underwent gross total resection (GTR). MGMT status was known in 28%, 42% of whom were methylated. Median PFS was 8.3 months (95% CI 6.9-11.0) and OS was 12.7 months (95% CI 9.7-14.1). Patients age >= 70 with KPS >= 90 had a median OS of 12.4 months. Median OS was 27.1 months for MGMT methylated patients. On MVA controlling for age, dose, KPS, MGMT, GTR, and adjuvant TMZ, younger age (HR 0.9, 95% CI 0.8-0.9, p < 0.01), MGMT methylation (HR:0.2, 95% CI 0.1-0.7, p = 0.01), and GTR (HR:0.5, 95% CI 0.3-0.9, p = 0.01) were associated with improved OS. Our findings do not support routine use of a standard 6-week course of radiation therapy in elderly patients with glioblastoma.

2337,"Holistic peripheral processing of a polygon display. Polygon displays compress information that would otherwise be conveyed by separate indicators into a single display in which each reading is represented by the distance of a polygon vertex from its center. The effect on detection of fault states of varying the number of polygon vertices from 4 to 20 in a display presented peripherally around a dynamic, simulated flight display was studied. Presence of the dynamic task reduced both speed and accuracy of response to the polygon display but did not significantly affect the pattern of response to differing numbers of vertices. All measures of performance were better with larger numbers of vertices. If the vertices are processed serially, more vertices require more processing time. Therefore, the result argues for holistic processing and implies that such information integration is beneficial to human performance in fault detection.",Excluded

Photodynamic therapy (PDT) with 5-aminolaevulinic acid (ALA) is a novel treatment for high-grade dysplasia (HGD) in Barrett's esophagus (BE). Our aim was to evaluate the effectiveness of differing light doses. Patients with HGD in BE received oral ALA (60 mg/kg) activated by low (500 J/cm), medium (750 J/cm), high (1,000 J/cm), or highest (1,000 J/cm x2) light dose at 635 nm. Follow-up was by regular endoscopy with quadrantic biopsies. Twenty-four patients were treated. Successful eradication of HGD was significantly correlated with light dose (log rank, p < 0.01). Six of eight patients (75%) treated with the highest light dose, one of two treated with high dose (50%), two of nine (22%) receiving medium light dose, and zero of five receiving low light dose had successful eradication of HGD (median follow-up 45 months, range 1-78 months). No skin photosensitivity or esophageal strictures occurred. The efficacy of ALA-PDT for eradication of HGD in BE is closely related to the light dose used. With a drug dose of 60 mg/kg and light at 635 nm, we recommend a minimum light dose of 1,000 J/cm of esophagus. This dose appears safe.",Excluded
3618,"Argon plasma coagulation for the treatment of hemorrhagic radiation proctitis. BACKGROUND AND STUDY AIMS: Chronic radiation proctitis is a complication of radiotherapy for malignant pelvic diseases. Rectal bleeding caused by radiation proctitis is difficult to manage. Argon plasma coagulation (APC) is an electrocoagulation technique that appears to be an effective and low-cost alternative to the use of lasers in gastrointestinal endoscopy. The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of APC, as well as patients' tolerance of the procedure, in the treatment of bleeding radiation-induced proctitis., PATIENTS AND METHODS: The charts of 16 patients with chronic radiation proctitis were analyzed retrospectively. Their average age was 73.5 (range 62-80). Fifteen patients had prostate cancer, and one had uterine cancer. The average time to onset of symptoms after radiotherapy was 15 months (range 6-36 months). All patients had intermittent or daily rectal bleeding, and three patients needed blood transfusions. The severity of bleeding was graded from 0 to 4. APC treatment was administered every month; the argon gas flow was set at 0.6 l/min with an electrical power setting of 40 W., RESULTS: All patients were improved with APC treatment. A mean of 3.7 sessions was necessary to relieve symptoms. APC therapy resulted in a reduction in the mean severity score from 2.4 to 0.6. Seven patients had no recurrent rectal bleeding, and the bleeding was significantly reduced to occasional and negligible spotting (less than one bleeding episode per week) in nine patients. None of the patients required transfusions after treatment. During the follow-up period (average 10.7 months, range 8-28 months), one patient had a recurrence of rectal bleeding that required two repeat sessions. The tolerance was good, with no long-term treatment-related complications., CONCLUSIONS: APC is an effective, safe and well-tolerated treatment for rectal bleeding caused by chronic radiation proctitis. It should be considered as a first-line therapy for radiation proctitis.",Excluded

Cisplatin was given at days 1, 22, and 43. Median follow-up was 36 months., RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: Grade 3 mucositis, dysphagia, and erythema was observed in ten (25%), nine (23%), and six (13%) patients, respectively. Grade 3 or more anemia was observed in two (6%) patients, and leukopenia in five (13%) patients. No grade 3 or 4 thrombocytopenia was observed. Grade 3 nephrotoxicity was observed in one patient (3%). No treatment-related mortality was observed. Grade 2 or more xerostomia and edema were observed in ten (25%) and one (3%) patient, respectively. Locoregional relapse occurred in eight patients, and seven patients developed distant metastases. Median time to locoregional relapse was 6 months. Three-year overall, disease-free survival, and locoregional control rates were 63%, 62%, and 81%, respectively. Multivariate analysis revealed that the only prognostic factor was nodal status., CONCLUSION: Reducing overall treatment time using accelerated PORT/CT by weekly concomitant boost (six fractions per week) combined with concomitant cisplatin CT is easily feasible with acceptable morbidity.",Excluded

Background: This phase I study was aimed at defining the toxicity profile and pathological response rate of a neoadjuvant schedule including weekly docetaxel and cisplatin, protracted venous infusion (PVI) of 5-FU and concomitant radiotherapy (RT) in locally advanced esophageal cancer. Patients and Methods: The schedule consisted of a first phase of chemotherapy alone and a second phase of concurrent chemoradiation. Initial doses were: docetaxel and cisplatin 20 mg/m2 on days 1, 8, 15, 29, 36 and 43 plus 5-FU 150 mg/m2 PVI on days 1-21 and 29-49; RT (40 Gy) started on day 29. In the following steps the doses were escalated up to docetaxel 35 mg/m2 and cisplatin 25 mg/m2 on days 1, 8, 15, 29, 36, 43, 50 and 57 plus 5-FU 180 mg/m2 PVI on days 1-21 and 150 mg/m2 PVI on days 29-63 concurrently with RT 50 Gy. Result(s): Forty-seven patients were enrolled and 46 completed the planned treatment. During the concomitant phase, grade 3-4 hematological toxicities occurred in three patients (6.5%) (or 3/174 cycles) and non-hematological toxicities in six patients (13%) (or 7/179 cycles). A pathological downstaging was obtained in 59.6% of the cases (28/47): complete remission (pCR) in 14 patients, near pCR (residual microfoci on the primary pN0) in eight patients, pT2 pN0 in three patients and partial response on the primary with positive lymph nodes in three patients. Six (13%) and 13 (28%) patients were considered stable and non-responders, respectively. In the last dose level, eight pCR and four near-pCR were obtained out of 15 patients. The maximum tolerable dose was not formally defined because dose escalation was stopped at the last dose level. Conclusion(s): This schedule represents a feasible treatment and the high pathological response rate is extremely encouraging; the doses found in the last dose-level are the basis for an ongoing phase II study at our institution. © 2005 European Society for Medical Oncology.",Excluded

Purpose/Objective(s): To analyze the outcome of adjuvant chemoradiotherapy for patients with pancreatic adenocarcinoma who underwent incomplete resection, and to identify the prognostic factors for these patients. Materials/Methods: Data from 41 patients with pancreatic adenocarcinoma who underwent R1 or R2 resection followed by adjuvant chemoradiotherapy from January 1987 to March 2010 was collected. There were 27 men and 14 women, and the median age was 60 years (range, 40-84). The adjuvant radiotherapy (RT) was delivered to the tumor bed and regional lymph nodes. Radiation dose was less than 50 Gy for 22 patients and at least 50 Gy for 19 patients. The chemotherapy during radiotherapy was either 5-fluorouracil (n = 37) or capecitabine (n = 4). The median follow-up duration was 15.8 months (range 4.5 -53.4). Result(s): The median survival was 13.2 months and the 2-year overall survival (OS) was 17% ; the median time to failure was 7.5 months and 2-year progression free survival (PFS) rate was 9% ; the median time to distant metastasis was 9.2 months and the 2- year distant metastasis free survival (DMFS) rate was 27% ; the median time to locoregional failure was 10.8 months and the locoregional failure free survival (LRFFS) rate was 16%. On univariate analysis, nodal involvement (p = 0.046), post-operative CA 19-9 (<=37 U/mL vs>37 U/mL,p=0.027) and post-RT CA 19-9 (<=37 U/mL vs.37 U/mL, p<0.001) were associated with OS. Nodal involvement (p = 0.053 for PFS, p = 0.029 for LRFFS), initial CA 19-9 (<=1000 U/mL vs .1000 U/mL, p = 0.029 for PFS,p=0.003 for LRFFS), post-operative CA 19-9 (p=0.03 for PFS,p= 0.035 for LRFFS) and post-RT CA 19-9 (p<0.001 for PFS and LRFFS) were statistically significant prognosticators for PFS and LRFFS. For DMFS, nodal involvement (p=0.054) and post-RT CA 19-9 (p<0.001) were significant prognosticators. On multivariate analysis, only post-RT CA 19-9 showed statistical significance for all outcomes. There was no difference in all outcomes between R1 resection and R2 resection. RT dose was not a significant prognostic factor for all outcomes. However, in a subgroup analysis of 21 patients who had pancreatic head cancer and underwent 3-dimensional conformal RT, lower radiation dose was related with inferior PFS and DMFS (p = 0.085 and p = 0.068, respectively). Conclusion(s): Patients with pancreatic cancer after incomplete resection have poor outcomes even after adjuvant chemoradiotherapy. Nodal involvement and CA 19-9 were prognostic factors, whereas increased radiation dose showed marginal significance.",Excluded

Aim To assess the diagnostic accuracy of computed tomography coronary angiography (CTCA) using a combination of high-definition CT (HD-CTCA) and high level of reader experience, with invasive coronary angiography (ICA) as the reference standard, in high-risk patients for the investigation of coronary artery disease (CAD). Materials and methods Three hundred high-risk patients underwent HD-CTCA and ICA. Independent experts evaluated the images for the presence of significant CAD, defined primarily as the presence of moderate (>=50%) stenosis and secondarily as the presence of severe (>=70%) stenosis in at least one coronary segment, in a blinded fashion. HD-CTCA was compared to ICA as the reference standard. Results No patients were excluded. Two hundred and six patients (69%) had moderate and 178 (59%) had severe stenosis in at least one vessel at ICA. The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value were 97.1%, 97.9%, 99% and 93.9% for moderate stenosis, and 98.9%, 93.4%, 95.7% and 98.3%, for severe stenosis, on a per-patient basis. Conclusion The combination of HD-CTCA and experienced readers applied to a high-risk population, results in high diagnostic accuracy comparable to ICA.

In experiments with two species of animals (dogs, guinea pigs) irradiated with sublethal and lethal doses of gamma-rays, it was observed, that leucynferon had antiradiation effect. Course of injections: dogs--8 injections subcutaneus: 2.0 ml (1, 3, 5, 8, 12, 14, 21, 34 days after irradiation); guinea pigs--14 injections subcutaneus, 0.2 ml (1-14 days after irradiation). Therapeutical effect was explained by capacity of the preparation to defend the hemopoietic organs from the radiation and to stimulate hemopoiesis. Leucynferon hindered the development of acute radiation sickness symptoms. Immunoreactivity of dogs and guinea pigs in experimental group was more complete and restored faster. The growth of the automicroflora on the skin was restrained. Production of interferon-gamma (which is a function of T-lymphocytes) was restored faster.",Excluded

Objectives/Hypothesis: To review the fistula rate in irradiated patients undergoing salvage laryngectomy, compare the effect of closure type on fistula rate, and examine possible perioperative risk factors that might contribute to an increased fistula rate., Study Design: Case series with chart review., Methods: We conducted a retrospective review of the University of Pittsburgh head and neck tumor registry and identified 73 patients from 1998 to 2011 who had received prior radiation before total laryngectomy or salvage laryngectomy and who had either primary closure, pectoralis major myofascial (PMMF) flap onlay, or pectoralis major myocutaneous (PMMC) flap., Results: Fistula was more common in patients who underwent initial primary closure (45%) than in patients who had immediate PMMF onlay (10.5%). The fistula rate for patients who underwent immediate PMMC flap was 28.6%, intermediate to primary closure and PMMF flap. Several factors were evaluated for relationship to fistula, but no significant associations were identified. However, patients with fistula tended to have longer inpatient stays and may have been more likely to have a history of cardiovascular or hypoxic disease., Conclusion: Pharyngocutaneous fistula is a well-established complication of total laryngectomy and is especially a concern in patients with a previous history of radiation. Our retrospective review demonstrates that PMMF onlay flap appears to be more effective in reducing the rate of fistula compared to primary closure in these patients. Myocutaneous augmentation flaps, in contrast, have a fairly high fistula rate and may be better replaced with alternative closures such as free flaps.Copyright © 2013 The American Laryngological.",Excluded

Cumulative long-term exposure to solar ultraviolet radiation promotes premature skin aging characterized by wrinkle formation and reduced skin elasticity. In this study, we assessed whether microfat transfer could improve dermal and subcutaneous tissue thickness loss associated with photoaging. Twenty-one patients affected by facial photoaging (photodamage grade II-IV; age range 35-62 years; 19 females, 2 males; all of Caucasian origin) were treated using minimally invasive autologous dermal white fat transfer harvested with a recently designed microcannula. The results were determined by clinical assessment and patient self-evaluation and quantified by the Antera 3D dermal digital device for noninvasive, objective, reliable, and accurate assessment of facial skin texture, color, and wrinkle characteristics. Compared with the pretreatment condition, the increment in soft tissue volume and improvement in skin quality and texture were assessed by a dermatologist after treatment. In addition, instrumental evaluation by digital skin profilometry of the treated areas revealed a 41% reduction in average wrinkle depth (7.29 +/- 1.04 x 10-2 mm pretreatment vs. 4.31 +/- 1.16 x 10-2 mm at 90 days posttreatment; p < 0.001), improved skin texture, more homogeneous and uniform skin color, and declined facial hemoglobin and melanin concentrations. The majority of patients (above 90%) reported improvements in self-perception. No significant complications were reported throughout the study. In conclusion, by using digital profilometry analysis as an objective and innovative tool to determine the outcome of treatment, we demonstrated that autologous microfat transfer is a safe and well-tolerated procedure with measurable beneficial effects on facial skin aging.Copyright © 2017 British Association of Plastic, Reconstructive and Aesthetic Surgeons",Excluded

This pilot study investigated the feasibility, toxicity and effect of continuous, hyperfractionated, accelerated radiotherapy (CHART) in 19 patients with adenocarcinoma of the rectum who were treated at Mount Vernon Hospital between April 1992 and April 1994. A total dose of 54 Gy was given in 36 fractions over 12 consecutive days; three fractions of 1.5 Gy were employed each day with an interfraction interval of 6 hours. Of these 19 patients, 13 had local pelvic recurrence from rectal carcinoma, four had a primary rectal carcinoma (which was unsuitable for abdominoperineal resection because of patient frailty), and two had large, fixed, unresectable tumours and were given radiotherapy preoperatively to a lower dose of 42 Gy in 28 fractions over 10 days to facilitate surgery. However, none of the 19 patients subsequently underwent surgical resection. Treatment compliance with radiotherapy was 95%. Acute bowel toxicity was assessed by means of a daily bowel chart for 6 weeks and then at 8, 12 and 26 weeks after the completion of radiotherapy. Patients were subsequently scored using the World Health Organization (WHO) grading system. No toxic deaths were observed in this study. There were five grade 3 and one grade 4 toxicities (WHO scale) observed in six patients. There has been minimal acute bladder toxicity in two patients and skin reactions have been surprisingly minimal in all but three patients. Small bowel obstruction and late bowel damage, possibly attributable to radiotherapy, occurred in three patients. Complete pain relief was achieved in recurrent rectal cancer in 100% of patients, at a median of 15 days since commencing radiotherapy (range 7-63 days), and has been maintained for mean and median durations of 19 and 18 months respectively (range 1.5-45 months). Five patients have had a recurrence of pain at 3, 4, 8, 9 and 18 months respectively. All four patients with primary rectal adenocarcinoma achieved a complete response, which has been sustained for 4 months (until death), 54 and 57 months, although one patient relapsed locally at 8 months. In summary, CHART appears to be a feasible treatment for pelvic tumours with regard to toxicity.

The aim of this article was to investigate the effect of ambroxol on radiation lung injury and the expression of transforming growth factor beta1 (TGF-beta1), as well as tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) in plasma. Totally, 120 patients with locally advanced lung cancer in radiotherapy were randomized into treatment and control groups. Patients in the treatment group took ambroxol orally at a dosage of 90 mg, three times per day for 3 months from the beginning of radiotherapy. The expression of TGF-beta1 and TNF-alpha in plasma was analyzed. The clinical symptoms and lung diffusing capacity were monitored using high resolving power computed tomography. The level of TGF-beta1 in the control group was increased (11.8 +/- 5.5 ng/ml), whereas in ambroxol-treated patients, the increase was not significant (5.6 +/- 2.6 ng/ml, P < 0.001). Radiotherapy-induced elevation of TNF-alpha levels, seen in control patients, was also abolished after treatment with ambroxol (5.1 +/- 1.0 vs. 2.4 +/- 0.8 ng/ml, P < 0.001). In the treatment group, carbon monoxide diffusion capacity was not significantly decreased at 6, 12, and 18 months post-radiotherapy, compared with the control group (P < 0.05).

1827,"Use of surgical gamma probe for the detection of lymph node metastases in differentiated thyroid cancer. Background: Patients with differentiated thyroid cancer (DTC) after total or near-total thyroidectomy require 131I therapy. After surgery the persistence of lymph node metastases in our series of patients was frequent (30%). Such patients are preferentially treated with radioiodine and shifted to surgical reintervention when the nodal lesions persist after two 131I treatments. Aim(s): Use of an intraoperative radioactive probe (C-TraK) to allow a more radical surgical approach in thyroid cancer patients submitted to surgery for lymph node metastases. Methods and Results: After adequate withdrawal of L-thyroxine suppressive therapy six patients were given high 131I doses followed by post-therapy WBS which demonstrated cervical activity in 5 patients and peri-jugular activity in 1. Surgery with the help of a gamma probe allowed to detect and remove all metastatic nodes. After excision all surgical specimens showed higher radioactive counts with respect to the background. The post-surgical scan showed the disappearance of all areas of 131I uptake. Histology confirmed the presence of metastatic lesions from papillary thyroid cancer.

2716,"Corticofugal modulation of the tactile response coherence of projecting neurons in the gracilis nucleus. Precise and reproducible spike timing is one of the alternatives of the sensory stimulus encoding. We test coherence (repeatability) of the response patterns elicited in projecting gracile neurons by tactile stimulation and its modulation provoked by electrical stimulation of the corticofugal feedback from the somatosensory (SI) cortex. To gain the temporal structure we adopt the wavelet-based approach for quantification of the functional stimulus-neural response coupling. We show that the spontaneous firing patterns (when they exist) are essentially random. Tactile stimulation of the neuron receptive field strongly increases the spectral power in the stimulus and 5- to 15-Hz frequency bands. However, the functional coupling (coherence) between the sensory stimulus and the neural response exhibits ultraslow oscillation (0.07 Hz). During this oscillation the stimulus coherence can temporarily fall below the statistically significant level, i.e., the functional stimulus-response coupling may be temporarily lost for a single neuron. We further demonstrate that electrical stimulation of the SI cortex increases the stimulus coherence for about 60% of cells. We find no significant correlation between the increment of the firing rate and the stimulus coherence, but we show that there is a positive correlation with the amplitude of the peristimulus time histogram. The latter argues that the observed facilitation of the neural response by the corticofugal pathway, at least in part, may be mediated through an appropriate ordering of the stimulus-evoked firing pattern, and the coherence enhancement is more relevant in gracilis nucleus than an increase of the number of spikes elicited by the tactile stimulus.",Excluded

AIM: Ultraviolet (UV) B irradiation induces gene expression that leads to skin cancer. Among the transcription factors induced by UVB radiation exposure, the cyclic AMP response element-binding protein (CREB) is significant. Since several factors downstream of CREB signaling are known to be involved in pterygium pathogenesis, we investigated CREB expression in pterygial and human conjunctival tissues to evaluate if a similar expression pattern is present. Moreover, we analyzed the correlation with CREB expression and other known pterygium markers., METHODS: Primary pterygium samples and normal bulbar conjunctivas surgically removed were analyzed. Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissues were stained by immunohistochemistry with anti-CREB, anti-vimentin, anti-ki-67, anti-survivin, anti-MMP7, anti-p63, anti-cyclin D1, or anti-p53 antibodies., RESULTS: 94.4% of pterygium samples were positive for CREB with a significant difference compared to the control group (p = 0.002). The staining was localized in the epithelium and absent in the stroma. An increased expression was found for cyclin D1 (p = 0.019), ki-67 (p = 0.005), vimentin (p = 0.003), survivin (p < 0.001), p63 (p = 0.003), and MMP7 (p = 0.002). CREB expression showed a significant correlation with cyclin D1 (rho = 0.49; p = 0.035), ki-67 (rho = 0.61; p = 0.007), and p53 (rho = 0.57; p = 0.013) in pterygium., CONCLUSIONS: These results permit to hypothesize that CREB is involved in pterygium pathogenesis. Since various molecules have been discovered to inhibit CREB, these data could be of interest for pterygium treatment. Copyright © 2013 S. Karger AG, Basel.",Excluded
2084,"Vertebroplasty combined with anti-osteoporosis treatment reduces refracture rate. BACKGROUND: Currently, vertebral compression fractures are the most common osteoporotic fracture in postmenopausal women; however, incidence of refracture has aroused increasing attention due to a lack of standard treatment. OBJECTIVE(S): To evaluate whether vertebroplasty combined with anti-osteoporosis treatment can reduce refracture rate following osteoporotic vertebral compressive fractures. METHOD(S): Eighty-nine patients with osteoporotic vertebral compressive fractures undergoing vertebroplasty were divided into control group (n=38) and treatment group (n=51) after making an informed choice about treatment. Chest/lumbar X-ray and bone mineral density determinations were performed through outpatient or inpatient follow-up. The spinal stability, bone mineral density and refracture rate of patients in both groups were followed up. RESULTS AND CONCLUSION(S): Seventy-eight patients achieved complete follow-up (ranged from 6-39 months, average 26.73 months). There was no significant difference in the spinal stability between both groups (P > 0.05), while rare bone trabecula was found in the control group. There was a significant difference in bone mineral density between both groups at postoperative 12, 24, and 36 months (P < 0.05). The refracture rate in the treatment group was significantly lower than that in the control group (P < 0.05). Our results indicate that anti-osteoporosis treatment can effectively reduce the incidence of refracture after vertebroplasty in patients with osteoporotic vertebral compressive fractures, and this study found satisfactory short-and medium-term clinical outcomes.Copyright © 2016, Journal of Clinical Rehabilitative Tissue Engineering Research.

2725,"Regression models for near-infrared measurement of subcutaneous adipose tissue thickness. Obesity is often associated with the risks of diabetes and cardiovascular disease, and there is a need to measure subcutaneous adipose tissue (SAT) thickness for acquiring the distribution of body fat. The present study aimed to develop and evaluate different model-based methods for SAT thickness measurement using an SATmeter developed in our laboratory. Near-infrared signals backscattered from the body surfaces from 40 subjects at 20 body sites each were recorded. Linear regression (LR) and support vector regression (SVR) models were established to predict SAT thickness on different body sites. The measurement accuracy was evaluated by ultrasound, and compared with results from a mechanical skinfold caliper (MSC) and a body composition balance monitor (BCBM). The results showed that both LR- and SVR-based measurement produced better accuracy than MSC and BCBM. It was also concluded that by using regression models specifically designed for certain parts of human body, higher measurement accuracy could be achieved than using a general model for the whole body. Our results demonstrated that the SATmeter is a feasible method, which can be applied at home and in the community due to its portability and convenience.",Excluded
1134,"Concurrent liposomal paclitaxel and cisplatin chemotherapy improved outcomes for locally advanced esophageal squamous cell carcinoma treated with intensity-modulated radiotherapy. Background: To ascertain whether concurrent chemotherapy using liposomal paclitaxel and cisplatin could improve the outcomes of patients with locally advanced esophageal squamous cell carcinoma receiving intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT). Method(s): A total of 72 patients with locally advanced esophageal squamous cell carcinoma, which were admitted to our hospital from October 2011 to December 2013, were retrospectively analyzed in this study. Result(s): Thirty-six patients (50%) were treated with IMRT alone, while the other 36 patients (50%) were treated by IMRT combined with chemotherapy containing liposomal paclitaxel and cisplatin. Patients treated with chemoradiotherapy showed significantly superior overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) compared to patients treated with IMRT alone (median OS: respectively, 29.7 vs. 12.9 months, P=0.0287; median PFS: respectively, 14.0 vs. 6.5 months, P=0.0186). Multivariate Cox analysis confirmed the inclusion of chemotherapy as an independent predictor of favorable OS and PFS. Both chemoradiotherapy and IMRT were well-tolerated in our cohort. Conclusion(s): Chemotherapy improved the prognosis of locally advanced esophageal squamous cell carcinoma treated with IMRT. Large prospective studies are needed to confirm the therapeutic value of IMRT combined with chemotherapy in locally advanced esophageal squamous cell carcinoma.Copyright © Annals of Translational Medicine.

In the liver, an area of low attenuation corresponding to the radiation port (or an area of hyperattenuation if the underlying liver tissue shows fatty change) can be seen at computed tomography (CT) performed within 3-6 months after therapy. Later, the liver may be fibrotic and contracted. In the stomach, small intestine, and colon, wall thickening and edema are early manifestations. Ulcers may also be observed. Long-term complications include strictures and fistulas. After irradiation of the kidneys, altered attenuation of the renal parenchyma may be seen at CT. Ureteral strictures, typically involving the distal ureter, may be observed after pelvic irradiation. The bladder may be small and contracted with a thickened wall after radiation exposure. Fistulas between the bladder and other pelvic organs sometimes occur. Typical musculoskeletal changes include growth abnormalities in skeletally immature patients, fatty replacement of bone marrow, and radiation osteitis.

1516,"Does the Gamma Knife dose rate affect outcomes in radiosurgery for trigeminal neuralgia?. OBJECT: The object of this study was to determine whether the radiation dose rate affects clinical outcomes in patients who undergo stereotactic Gamma Knife surgery (GKS) to manage typical trigeminal neuralgia (TN)., METHODS: The authors retrospectively studied pain relief in 165 patients with medically intractable TN, who underwent 80-Gy GKS using a single 4-mm collimator between 1994 and 2005. No patient had received prior radiation treatment. The measured relative helmet output factor of the Gamma Knife was 0.8 throughout this interval, and the dose rate varied from 1.21 Gy/minute to 3.74 Gy/minute (median 2.06 Gy/minute). Irradiation time varied from 26.73 to 95.11 minutes. The authors divided patients into a low-dose-rate (LDR) group, in which the dose rate varied from 1.21 to 2.05 Gy/minute, and a high-dose-rate (HDR) group, in which the dose rate varied from 2.06 to 3.74 Gy/minute. Post-GKS, the patients' pain control was determined using the Barrow Neurological Institute (BNI) pain scale. There was no statistically significant difference between groups with respect to history of prior microvascular decompression (p = 0.410) or peripheral neuroablative procedures (p = 0.583). The length of symptoms in patients varied from 3 to 414 months with a median of 84 months (p = 0.698). Median follow-up was 26 months with a maximum of 139 months., RESULTS: Initial pain relief was obtained in 71% of patients in the LDR group and 78% in the HDR group (p = 0.547). Patients who initially obtained improved pain relief (BNI Scores I-IIIa) after GKS maintained pain control for median durations of 52 months (LDR group) and 54 months (HDR group) (p = 0.403). New or increased facial sensory dysfunction was found in 14.5% of patients in the LDR group and in 19.3% of patients in the HDR group (p = 0.479)., CONCLUSIONS: The authors found that the GKS dose rate did not affect pain control or morbidity within the range of 1.21-3.74 Gy/minute. Cobalt 60 source decay did not affect outcomes of GKS for TN pain management, even for dose rates approximating a 2-half-life decay of the isotope.",Excluded
2073,"Octreotide acetate enables the administration of chemoradiotherapy, including the oral anticancer drug S-1, in gastric cancer patients with malignant gastrointestinal obstruction. Advanced gastric cancer frequently RESULTS in the inability to ingest food or drink orally, a condition called malignant gastrointestinal obstruction (MGO). MGO is clinically defned as a gastrointestinal outlet obstruction caused by a large tumor, or malignant bowel obstruction with peritoneal dissemination. MGO impacts the quality of life by interfering with oral intake and by causing gastrointestinal symptoms, such as nausea, vomiting and abdominal pain. Octreotide acetate (OA) is an analogue of somatostatin which has been increasingly used to relieve gastrointestinal symptoms since it decreases the secretion of digestive juices and increases the absorption of water and electrolytes. In Japan, the oral anticancer drug S-1 was recently adopted as a key chemotherapeutic agent in advanced gastric cancer; however, its oral formulation precludes its utility in the MGO setting. This is a pilot study of chemoradiotherapy plus OA in gastric cancer with MGO. Patients were initially treated with OA to control gastrointestinal symptoms. Following resolution of their symptoms, the patients received chemotherapy with S-1 plus low-dose cisplatin and radiation. Irradiation was targeted at the primary tumor and surrounding lesions, including the lymph nodes. Grade 4 toxicity was observed in only 1 patient, and no treatment-related deaths were noted. After treatment, 3 patients achieved a partial response and 4 achieved stable disease. Of the 9 patients, 8 were able to tolerate solid food orally and were discharged. The outcomes of these cases suggest that OA is a useful adjunctive therapy that enables advanced gastric cancer patients with MGO to receive S-1-containing chemotherapy.",Excluded
3495,"Upfront Gamma Knife radiosurgery for Cushing's disease and acromegaly: A multicenter, international study. OBJECTIVE Gamma Knife radiosurgery (GKS) is typically used after failed resection in patients with Cushing's disease (CD) and acromegaly. Little is known about the upfront role of GKS for patients with CD and acromegaly. In this study, the authors examine the outcome of upfront GKS for patients with these functioning adenomas. METHODS An international group of 7 Gamma Knife centers sent pooled data from 46 patients (21 with CD and 25 with acromegaly) undergoing upfront GKS to the coordinating center of the study for analysis. Diagnosis was established on the basis of clinical, endocrine, and radiological studies. All patients were treated on a common radiosurgical platform and longitudinally followed for tumor control, endocrine remission, and hypopituitarism. Patients received a tumor median margin dose of 25 Gy (range 12-40.0 Gy) at a median isodose of 50%. RESULTS The median endocrine follow-up was 69.5 months (range 9-246 months). Endocrine remission was achieved in 51% of the entire cohort, with 28% remission in acromegaly and 81% remission for those with CD at the 5-year interval. Patients with CD achieved remission earlier as compared to those with acromegaly (p = 0.0005). In patients post-GKS, the pituitary adenoma remained stable (39%) or reduced (61%) in size. Hypopituitarism occurred in 9 patients (19.6%), and 1 (2.2%) developed third cranial nerve (CN III) palsy. Eight patients needed further intervention, including repeat GKS in 6 and transsphenoidal surgery in 2. CONCLUSIONS Upfront GKS resulted in good tumor control as well as a low rate of adverse radiation effects in the whole group. Patients with CD achieved a faster and far better remission rate after upfront GKS in comparison to patients with acromegaly. GKS can be considered as an upfront treatment in carefully selected patients with CD who are unwilling or unable to undergo resection, but it has a more limited role in acromegaly.Copyright ©AANS 2019",Excluded
2060,"[The impact of proton pump inhibitors on esophageal acid exposure in gastroesophageal reflux disease]. OBJECTIVE: To explore the effects of proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) therapy on esophageal acid exposure of patients with gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), and the correlation of anxiety and depression with recurrence of acid-related symptoms after discontinuation of PPIs., METHODS: From February 2010 to June 2011, 28 patients with GERD diagnosed by ambulatory 24 h esophageal pH monitoring admitted to Beijing Jishuitan Hospital were treated with esomeprazole 20 mg 2 times/d for 8 weeks (male 16, female 12). Symptoms after drug discontinuation were monitored. Ambulatory 24 h esophageal pH monitoring was performed on patients, whose symptom recurred within 8 weeks after treatment. BMI, Self-rating Anxiety Scale (SAS), and Self-rating Depression Scale (SDS) were detected., RESULTS: Among the 28 patients with GERD, 15 (53.6%) recurred symptoms after withdraw of PPIs. Compared with the asymptomatic group after withdraw of PPIs, the pretreatment duration of pH 4 (supine), 24 h total acid reflux time, number of time periods with acid reflux > 5 minutes, the maximal acid reflux time and 24 h total number of acid reflux in the symptomatic recurrence group were statistically significantly increased (11.7% vs 4.5%, 138.8 minutes vs 62.1 minutes, 6.0 vs 2.0, 27.0 minutes vs 12.4 minutes, 74.0 times vs 43.0 times, respectively, all P values < 0.05). There were no significant differences in BMI, SAS and SDS between the two groups., CONCLUSIONS: The basic level of esophageal acid exposure of patients with GERD before PPIs therapy may influence the esophageal acid exposure after PPIs therapy and then may affect the recurrence of symptoms. Although anxiety and depression is common in patients with GERD, it is not found that the recurrence of acid-related symptoms after the discontinuation of PPIs therapy is related to the anxiety and depression.",Excluded

Climatological data from 4 weather stations in the area were collected. The association between RRD incidence and solar radiation was investigated., RESULTS: A total of 256 RRD cases were identified. There was a seasonal variation in the incidence of RRD with a maximum number of incident cases observed in June and July and a minimum number of cases observed in January and December. An association was found between RRD incidence and solar radiation both monthly (p = 0.004) and bimonthly (p = 0.057). The right eye was more frequently affected than the left eye (p = 0.035). RD cases other than rhegmatogenous showed neither seasonality nor association with radiation., CONCLUSIONS: Solar radiation may play a role in RRD genesis in our area. Laterality could be related to the amount of radiation reaching each eye. Copyright © 2019 S. Karger AG, Basel.",Excluded
510,"Decreased asbestos-induced lung inflammation and fibrosis after radiation and bone marrow transplant. The effect of lung irradiation on subsequent inflammatory or fibrotic lung injuries remains poorly understood. We postulated that irradiation and bone marrow transplantation might impact the development and progression of lung remodeling resulting from asbestos inhalation. Our objective was to determine whether irradiation and bone marrow transplantation affected inflammation and fibrosis associated with inhaled asbestos exposure. Inflammation, cytokine production, and fibrosis were assessed in lungs of naive and sex-mismatched chimeric mice exposed to asbestos for 3, 9, or 40 days. Potential engraftment of donor-derived cells in recipient lungs was examined by fluorescence in situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry. Compared with asbestos-exposed naive (nonchimeric) mice, chimeric mice exposed to asbestos for 3, 9, or 40 days demonstrated significant abrogation of acute increases in asbestos-associated inflammatory mediators and fibrosis. Donor-derived cells trafficked to lung but did not significantly engraft as phenotypic lung cells. Irradiation and bone marrow transplantation alters inflammatory and fibrotic responses to asbestos, likely through modulation of soluble inflammatory mediators.",Excluded

Background The aim of this trial was to determine feasibility of incorporating bevacizumab (B) into concurrent chemoradiotherapy (CRT) for locally advanced non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Patients and Methods Patients with unresectable stage III NSCLC, performance status of 0 to 1, and adequate organ function were accrued in 2 strata, low- and high-risk (squamous histology, hemoptysis, tumor with cavitation and/or adjacent to a major vessel). Cohort 1 patients received cisplatin 50 mg/m2 days (d) 1 and 8, etoposide 50 mg/m2 (d 1-5) for 2 cycles concurrent with radiotherapy (64.8 Gy) followed by docetaxel (D) 75 mg/m2 and B 15 mg/kg for 3 cycles. If safety was established, then accrual would continue to cohort 2 (B, d 15, 36, 57) and then subsequently to cohort 3 (B, d 1, 22, 43). Results Twenty-nine patients (17 low- and 12 high-risk) registered to cohort 1. Twenty-six patients (including 4 squamous, 1 adenosquamous) were assessable. Twenty-five completed CRT. Grade 3/4 toxicities during CRT included acceptable rates of hematologic toxicity, esophagitis, and pneumonitis. Of 21 assessable for safety with D/B consolidation, major adverse events were pneumonitis (2 Grade 3) and 2 episodes of fatal hemoptysis in the high-risk group, resulting in closure of this stratum. The low-risk stratum subsequently closed because of slow accrual. Median overall survival was 46 months for low-risk and 17 months for high-risk strata. Conclusion Bevacizumab was not safely integrated into CRT for stage III NSCLC in patients considered at high risk for hemoptysis. In lower risk patients, data are insufficient to determine safety or efficacy.Copyright © 2015 Elsevier Inc.",Excluded

Narrow-band UVB (NB-UVB) is light over a very narrow band of wavelengths (around 311 nm) that is concentrated in the therapeutic range and minimally in the sunburn range. It has therefore become the phototherapy treatment of choice for skin diseases. The minimal erythema dose (MED) on canine skin for standardizing dosage schedules in NB-UVB treatment and histopathological analyses were performed in these dogs. In all 32 dogs tested, the MED ranged from 432 to 864 mJ/cm2. There were no significant differences in MED among breeds, sex and age groups. Histopathology obtained from areas irradiated by MED showed only mild vascular dilatation.

3267,"Radiotherapy-induced pemphigus vulgaris with autoantibodies targeting a 110kDa epidermal antigen. Background Pemphigus is an autoimmune intraepidermal blistering disease mediated by autoantibodies targeting desmosomes. It can be induced by many triggers, such as ionizing radiation. Methods We report a case of radiotherapy-induced pemphigus (RIP) with a review of the published cases in the English and French literature. Results A 61-year old man was diagnosed to have epidermoid carcinoma of the piriform sinus and then received a 70 Gy radiation therapy. One month after the treatment completion, multiple blisters and erosions occurred initially on the site of irradiation, then in other skin areas. Histological examination showed an intraepidermal blister with acantholysis and necrosis of individual keratinocytes. Direct immunofluorescence and indirect immunofluorescence were typical of pemphigus. Immunoblot revealed antibodies reacting with a 110 kDa antigen. This feature was consistent with the diagnosis of RIP. Less than 20 cases of RIP have been reported previously. Mean age at diagnosis was 64.2 years, and there is a slight female preponderance. RIP occurred, in most cases, initially within the area of irradiation. Conclusion Our patient showed some distinctive findings never reported previously in RIP: a histological focal keratinocyte necrosis, and the presence of autoantibodies reacting with a 110 kDa keratinocytic protein in immunoblot analysis. Because of a different prognosis, it is important to differentiate RIP and paraneoplastic pemphigus (PNP), although cases of ionizing radiation-induced PNP had also been described. As in our patient, RIP seems to respond well to systemic corticosteroids and immunosuppressive therapy, which induce remission within a few months. © 2011 The International Society of Dermatology.",Excluded

2926,"Immune events associated with protection in C57BL/6 mice immunized with anti-idiotypic antibodies mimicking protective antigens shared between gamma-irradiated cercariae vaccine and human resistance model of Schistosoma haematobium. Immunoregulation is central for successful manipulation of schistosomiasis. Unlike schistosome vaccine development strategies that relied on direct selection of antigens from crude responses leading to selection of mildly protective antigens, the present study tested the utility of selection of potentially protective antigens encompassed rounds of immunoregulation via idiotypic network. Anti-idiotypic antibodies (Ab2) were purified from sera of New Zealand white rabbits multiply immunized with gamma-irradiated cercariae of S. haematobium, using adult worm specific idiotypes (Ab1) purified from sera of subjects resistant to reinfection. Ab2 was used for immunization of C57BL/6 mice and consequences of immunization were monitored before and after challenge infection with S. haematobium. Results showed an increase of splenic T cell expression of intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) and very late antigen-4 (VLA-4) upon immunization (average % stimulated cells 54.9 vs. 20.4, P < 0.05 for ICAM-1 and 31.1 vs. 6.6, P < 0.01 for VLA-4) and challenge, especially at day 6 (83.5 vs. 45.6, P < 0.01) for ICAM-1 and day 10 (50.4 vs. 20.8, P < 0.05) for VLA-4. Thereafter, both adhesion molecules declined at day 28 through 90. Similarly, lymphoproliferation was manifested upon immunization (OD570-630 0.27 vs. 0.09, P < 0.01) and challenge at day 6 (0.5 vs. 0.17, P < 0.01) through day 10 (0.49 vs.0.18, P < 0.05), then declined at day 28 through 90. Moreover, sera of Ab2-immunized mice exhibited an anti-anti-ids (Ab3) reactivity against antigens of approximate molecular weight 40, 80 and 160 kDa of adult worms, which were also recognized by Ab1. However, in contrast to Ab1, Ab3 showed no surface binding to 3 hr schistosomula. Strikingly, mice immunized with Ab2 showed strong resistance to challenge infection (approximately 82% reduction in worm burden, P < 0.001). Taking all, this alternative vaccine development strategy appears to filter out non-protective antigens. Indeed Ab3 recognizes much fewer numbers of antigens, which passed through two rounds of immune regulation. These antigens appear to represent a significant proportion of the protective response in the gamma-irradiated cercariae vaccine and human resistance model as well, providing the basis for an alternative vaccine for schistosomiasis.",Excluded
147,"Effect of radiation fraction size on local control rates for early glottic carcinoma. A model analysis for in vivo tumor growth and radio-response parameters. BACKGROUND: Two recent studies have suggested that the probability of local control for early glottic carcinoma (stages T1 and T2) following radiation therapy is lower when daily fractions of 1.8 Gy are given instead of 2.0 Gy when the total dose is kept constant at approximately 66 Gy., METHODS: We reviewed our experience with a total of 42 patients with T1, N0, M0 squamous cell carcinoma of the glottic larynx who were treated with radiation alone during the period 1979 to 1989. All patients received conventional fractionation radiation therapy (one treatment per day, 5 days per week). Eight patients received 2.0 Gy per fraction for an average total dose of 64.8 Gy, and 34 patients received 1.8 Gy per fraction for an average total dose of 66.7 Gy. We also calculated overall survival statistics. Combining the clinical data from our series and those of patients from other series (171 total patients), we analyzed the tumor response curve and doubling time for early glottic carcinoma by using a time-dependent, linear quadratic equation model. The analysis is valid for the typical range of radioresponsiveness for most tumors in healthy tissue., RESULTS: Using statistical z analysis, we noted a significant difference in the local control rates at 5 years, with better local control in the group that received 2.0 Gy per fraction (100% vs 70%). Our results for the calculated doubling time and tumor response curves correspond with experimental values for in vitro squamous cell carcinoma systems., CONCLUSION: It appears from the literature and from our data that the control rates for T1, N0, M0 glottic carcinoma may be significantly improved by using 2.0 Gy per fraction dose vs 1.8 Gy per fraction dose. Our analysis has provided a model of in vivo tumor response of early glottic carcinomas based on reported local control rates using these two different treatment regimens.",Excluded

Several studies suggest that dietary supplementation with antioxidant can influence the response to chemotherapy as well as the development of adverse side effects caused by treatment with chemotherapeutic agents. Using CBA mouse model, we investigated a clinically potential use of a water-soluble derivative of propolis (WSDP) in the treatment of various cytopenias induced by radiation and/or chemotherapy. Also, the antimetastatic efficiency of WSDP given intraperitoneally alone or in combination with chemotherapeutic agents and their effects on the blood leukocytes count as well as on hematopoiesis were studied. Tumor was a transplantable mammary carcinoma (MCa) of CBA mouse. Metastases in the lung were generated by injecting viable tumor cells intravenously (iv). WSDP (50 or 150 mg/kg) exerted a significant antimetastatic effect (P < 0.001) when given either before or after tumor cell inoculation. In combined treatment WSDP and Epirubicin profoundly inhibited metastasis formation; this synergistic effect is maximal when Epirubicin and WSDP were administrated after tumor cell inoculation. Positive outcome of combined treatment with WSDP and Epirubicin was also found regarding the number of red and white blood cells in peripheral blood while in mice treated with Epirubicin alone the significant drop in all hematological parameters was noticed on day 13 after tumor cell inoculation. Furthermore, when WSDP (50 mg/kg) was given perorally (po) for 20 consecutive days an increased number of exogenous CFUs was found in treated mice. WSDP given either for 20 or 40 days increased cellularity of hematopoietic tissue and the number of leucocytes in peripheral blood; prolonged treatment with WSDP also elevated myeloid and megakaryocytic types of CFUs. To conclude, these findings indicate that the combination of WSDP with chemotherapeutics could increase the antimetastatic potential of chemotherapeutic agents; these findings suggest the benefits of potential clinical trials using WSDP combined with chemotherapeutic agents in order to maximize their antitumor activity and minimize postchemotherapeutic or radiotherapeutic deteriorated reactions.",Excluded

Materials and methods. - A total of twenty consecutive, unselected patients (16 males, four females), were eligible for this study because the dose they were to received was 44 Gy (2 Gy/fraction) to the head, neck and supraclavicular regions. Patients were randomly allocated to one of two treatment groups. The first group (n = 11) was treated on a Philips SL-75 linear accelerator (SL- 75), using 5 MV photons and tray-mounted cerrobend blocks. The second group (n = 9) was treated on a Philips SL-25 linear accelerator (SL-25-MLC), using 6 MV photons and a MLC. Patients of the second group were treated using the automatic set-up facility of the SL-25-MLC, without entering the treatment room between consecutive fields. Result. - Overall treatment time was significantly shorter on the SL-25-MLC than on the SL-75 (P< 0.0001). The difference in total treatment-execution time was in the range of 157 s per treatment session. The largest difference was observed in the set-up time. There was an average of a 125 s time gain per treatment day (P < 0.0001) in favour of the SL-25-MLC.

BACKGROUND: Proton therapy (PT) improves outcomes in patients with nasal cavity (NC) and paranasal sinus (PNS) cancers. Herein, the authors have reported to their knowledge the largest series to date using intensity-modulated proton therapy (IMPT) in the treatment of these patients., METHODS: Between 2013 and 2018, a total of 86 consecutive patients (68 of whom were radiation-naive and 18 of whom were reirradiated) received PT to median doses of 70 grays and 67 grays relative biological effectiveness, respectively. Approximately 53% received IMPT., RESULTS: The median follow-up was 23.4 months (range, 1.7-69.3 months) for all patients and 28.1 months (range, 2.3-69.3 months) for surviving patients. The 2-year local control (LC), distant control, disease-free survival, and overall survival rates were 83%, 84%, 74%, and 81%, respectively, for radiation-naive patients and 77%, 80%, 54%, and 66%, respectively for reirradiated patients.

Sixteen radiation-naive patients (24%) experienced acute grade 3 toxicities; 4 (6%) experienced late grade 3 toxicities (osteoradionecrosis, vision loss, soft-tissue necrosis, and soft tissue fibrosis) (grading was performed according to the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events [version 5.0]). Slightly inferior LC was noted for patients undergoing reirradiation with higher complications: 11% experienced late grade 3 toxicities (facial pain and brain necrosis). Patients treated with reirradiation had more grade 1 to 2 radionecrosis than radiation-naive patients (brain: 33% vs 7% and osteoradionecrosis: 17% vs 3%)., CONCLUSIONS: PT achieved remarkable LC for patients with nasal cavity and paranasal sinus cancers with lower grade 3 toxicities relative to historical reports. IMPT has the potential to improve the therapeutic ratio in these malignancies and is worthy of further investigation. Copyright © 2020 American Cancer Society.",Excluded
939,"An analysis of anatomy image information on slice thickness variation in orbital CT scan examination. Background: In contrast to the literature, orbital CT scans at the hospital used a 1.25 mm thick slice, then reconstructed with a slice thickness according to the clinical setting. Aim(s): This research aimed to determine the anatomical image of orbital CT scan in slice thickness variations and determine the value of slice thickness, which produced optimal anatomical image information. Method(s): It was experimental research. There were 15 patients with orbital CT scans whose slice thickness was made into a 1.25 mm data row. The data row was then reconstructed with slice thickness variations into 1.25 mm, 2 mm, 2.5 mm, 3 mm, 4 mm, and 5 mm. Information clarity about anatomical imagery was assessed, including Nasal Bone, Optic Nerve, Sinus Ethmoidalis, Sinus Sphenoidalis, Lacrimal Bone, Cornea, Lens, Globe, and Sclera. Data analysis with Spearman test and Friedman test showed a = 5%. Result(s): There is a difference in information on anatomical images of orbital CT scan in Slice thickness variations with p-value <0.023. 2.5 mm slice thickness results in the most optimal anatomical image information with mean rank = 5.50. Slice thick 3 mm can be used as an alternative to getting the same anatomical image information with a smaller radiation dose.Copyright © 2021 Lahore Medical And Dental College.

3164,"Stereotactic radiosurgery of cranial nonvestibular schwannomas: Results of single-and multisession radiosurgery. BACKGROUND: Surgical resection of nonvestibular cranial schwannomas carries a considerable risk of postoperative complications. Stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) offers a non-invasive treatment alternative. The efficacy and safety of multi-session SRS of nonvestibular cranial schwannomas has not been well studied. OBJECTIVE(S): To analyze the results of single-and multi-session SRS of nonvestibular cranial schwannomas. METHOD(S): From 2001 to 2007, 42 lesions in 40 patients were treated with SRS at Stanford University Medical Center, targeting schwannomas of cranial nerves IV (n = 1), V (n = 18), VII (n = 6), X (n = 5), XII (n = 2), jugular foramen (n = 8), and cavernous sinus (n = 2). SRS was delivered to a median marginal dose of 18 Gy (range, 15-33 Gy) in 1 to 3 sessions, targeting a median tumor volume of 3.2 cm3 (range, 0.1-23.7 cm3). The median doses for treatments in 1 (n = 18), 2 (n = 9), and 3 (n = 15) sessions were 17.5, 20, and 18 Gy, respectively. RESULT(S): With a median follow-up of 29 months (range, 6-84 months), tumor control was achieved in 41 of the 42 lesions. Eighteen of 42 lesions (43%) decreased in size; 23 tumors (55%) remained stable. There were 2 cases of new or worsening cranial nerve deficits in patients treated in single session; no patient treated with multi-session SRS experienced any cranial nerve toxicity (P = 0.18). CONCLUSION(S): SRS of nonvestibular cranial schwannomas provides excellent tumor control with minimal risk of complications. There was a trend towards decreased complications with multi-session SRS.

2174,"Low-dose radiotherapy for lymphoid lesions of the orbit and ocular adnexa. Purpose: There is no agreement within the radiation oncology and ophthalmic communities regarding the treatment of lymphoid lesions of the orbit and ocular adnexa. The authors report their experience with the use of low-dose radiation therapy for malignant and benign lymphoid masses of the orbital region in a series of 54 patients treated between 1985 and 1993. Method(s): All patients received 2 Gy per day for a total of 24 Gy, except when the lesion was extensive, in which case the therapy was 1.5 Gy per day for a total of 25.5 Gy. A diagnosis was established by incisional surgical biopsy in 26 patients and aspiration cytology in 28 patients. Those with a malignant or an indeterminate diagnosis were evaluated with a modified Ann Arbor staging system. Result(s): Low-dose radiation therapy produced a complete response in 100% of the orbital lymphoid lesions. This local control was maintained in 52 patients (96%) for the first year and in 51 patients (95%) for 5 or more years with a mean follow-up of 7 years. One patient died of causes unrelated to the malignant lymphoma after the first year of observation. The mean age of the 54 patients was 67 years, and the range was 37 to 90 years. The mean ages of presentation for each location were: orbit, 67 years; conjunctiva, 68 years; lacrimal gland, 66 years; and eyelids, 72 years. The female-to-male ratio was 1.25:1 (34 women and 20 men). In this series, 9 patients had benign processes, 38 patients had non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, and 7 patients had abnormalities of indeterminate cause. All histologic subtypes of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma involving the orbit responded equally well to therapy. Forty-five patients had clinically staged disease as follows: stage I, 21 patients; stage II, 4 patients; stage III, 2 patients; and stage IV, 18 patients. Benign disease, diagnosed in 9 patients, was not staged. Conclusion(s): Low-dose radiation therapy proved effective in treating lymphoid lesions of the orbital area. No treatment-limiting complications occurred. The only early side effects were mild xerophthalmia and chemosis in 50% of patients, and the only chronic side effect was mild xerophthalmia in 33% of patients. Cataracts, corneal ulcerations, and retinal injury were not observed.",Excluded
1829,"Time trend of patient setup deviations during pelvic irradiation using electronic portal imaging. An electronic portal imaging device (EPID) was used to detect patient setup displacement during the course of a 3-field pelvic irradiation of two groups of patients: 10 rectal and 10 prostate carcinomas. These patients were irradiated with conventional treatment techniques in routine clinical practice. A total of 469 portal images and 60 simulator films were used to determine the values of setup deviations in the X- Y- and Z-directions of a fixed coordinate system, corresponding to the medio-lateral, cranio-caudal and antero-posterior direction, respectively. The absolute displacement averaged over all setups and patients ranged between 0.4 mm and 1.4 mm with a standard deviation (S.D.) of 1.6-3.9 mm. The overall distribution along each direction could be separated into a distribution of random deviations (S.D.s ranging from 1.2 to 2.8 mm) around the mean deviation of each patient and a distribution of the means themselves: the distribution of systematic deviations (S.D.s ranging from 1.0 to 2.6 mm). Significant gradual displacement as a function of time was detected in 5 out of the 20 patients, 2 in the rectum and 3 in the prostate group. This ""time trend"" was found along each of the 3 directions specified. The magnitude of the time-dependent displacement throughout the course of treatment ranged between 4 and 11 mm. It can be concluded that for treatments requiring a high level of precision, portal images should be made and analyzed during the whole treatment course in order to detect and correct significant time trends.",Excluded
2417,"Serial ultraviolet B exposure and serum 25 hydroxyvitamin D response in young adult American blacks and whites: no racial differences. We tested the hypothesis that repeated whole body suberythemal ultraviolet B (UVB) exposure would result in less increase of serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25OHD) concentrations in black compared with white young adults with no significant change or racial differences in serum calciotropic hormones concentrations. Thirteen white and 7 black adults ranging from 22 to 35 years of age were submitted to sequential total body suberythemal doses of UVB (280-315 nm) biweekly for 6 weeks. Initial UVB dose was 5% below the minimal erythemal dose for the most sensitive skin, followed by 10% increase per exposure for 4 weeks. Blood samples were drawn weekly. Baseline 25OHD concentrations were significantly lower in blacks compared to whites, but the increases in serum 25OHD concentrations were similar in both groups; there were no significant differences by sex or age. Serum 24,25-dihydroxyvitamin D [24,25-(OH)2D] concentrations paralleled the serum 250HD response. Mean serum calcium (total and ionized), magnesium, phosphate, alkaline phosphatase, vitamin D binding protein, C-terminal parathyroid hormone, calcitonin, 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D [1,25-(OH)2D], and osteocalcin concentrations did not differ between blacks and whites at any time. The ratio of the concentration of 1,25-(OH)2D to 25OHD in their serum was initially higher in blacks compared to whites (p less than 0.0001); the ratios decreased to levels similar to whites by the third UVB exposure. We conclude that, in blacks and whites, sequential suberythemal UVB exposure produces similar elevations of serum 25OHD concentrations and unchanged calciotropic hormones concentrations.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",Excluded
3632,"Induction chemotherapy with docetaxel plus cisplatin (TP regimen) followed by concurrent chemoradiotherapy with TP regimen versus cisplatin in treating locally advanced nasopharyngeal carcinoma. Background and Objective: Clinical trials on docetaxel plus cisplatin (DDP) (TP regimen) in treating nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) are still uncertain due to limited samples. This study was to compare the short-term efficacy and toxicity of induction chemotherapy with TP regimen followed by concurrent chemoradiotherapy with TP regimen versus DDP in treating locally advanced NPC. Method(s): Fifty-seven patients with stage T3-4N2-3M0 NPC diagnosed pathologically from December 2005 to December 2006 were randomized into TP group (30 patients) and DDP group (27 patients). Both groups received TP regimen as induction chemotherapy with docetaxel (70 mg/m2) on Day 1 and DDP (80 mg/m2) on Day 2, repeating every 21 days for two cycles. For concurrent chemotherapy, TP group were administered docetaxel (60 mg/ m2) on Day 1 and DDP (80 mg/m2) on Day 2; DDP group were administered DDP (80 mg/m2) on Day 1. Both schedules were repeated every 21 days for two cycles. Linear accelerator was used as radioactive source. Irradiation field was designed with CT-simulation and conventional fractions. Result(s): The 57 patients received 111 cycles of induction chemotherapy, and 53 of them received 103 cycles of concurrent chemotherapy; four patients ceased induction chemotherapy and three ceased concurrent chemotherapy. All patients completed radiotherapy. The major toxicity of induction chemotherapy was hematologic toxicity; the main toxicities of concurrent chemoradiotherapy were hematologic toxicity and mucositis. The occurrence rates of Grade 3-4 leucopenia and Grade 3-4 neutropenia were significantly higher in TP group than in DDP groups (p < 0.05). In concurrent chemoradiotherapy, the application rate of granulocyte colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) was significantly higher in TP group than in DDP group (100% vs. 72.0%, p < 0.05). After concurrent chemoradiotherapy, the complete remission (CR) rates of the nasopharynx and regional lymph nodes were 93.3% and 92.9% in TP group, and were 96.3% and 91.3% in DDP group (p > 0.05). Conclusion(s): The short-term efficacy of induction chemotherapy with TP regimen followed by concurrent chemoradiotherapy with TP regimen on locally advanced NPC is similar to that of TP regimen followed by concurrent chemoradiotherapy with DDP. The toxicity of the former schedule is severer than that of the latter, but it is tolerable with the use of G-CSF. The long-term efficacy of induction chemotherapy with TP regimen followed by concurrent chemoradiotherapy with TP regimen need to be further studied. © 2009 Landes Bioscience.",Excluded
3441,"Three-Dimensional Augmented Reality Visualization Informs Locoregional Therapy in a Translational Model of Hepatocellular Carcinoma. PURPOSE: To evaluate the utility of visualizing preprocedural MR images in 3-dimensional (3D) space using augmented reality (AR) before transarterial embolization of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in a preclinical model., MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 28 rats with diethylnitrosamine-induced HCCs > 5 mm treated with embolization were included in a prospective study. In 12 rats, 3D AR visualization of preprocedural MR images was performed before embolization. Procedural metrics including catheterization time and radiation exposure were compared vs a prospective cohort of 16 rats in which embolization was performed without AR. An additional cohort of 15 retrospective cases was identified and combined with the prospective control cohort (n = 31) to improve statistical power., RESULTS: A 37% reduction in fluoroscopy time, from 11.7 min to 7.4 minutes, was observed with AR when compared prospectively, which did not reach statistical significance (P = .12); however, when compared with combined prospective and retrospective controls, the reduction in fluoroscopy time from 14.1 min to 7.4 minutes (48%) was significant (P = .01). A 27% reduction in total catheterization time, from 42.7 minutes to 31.0 minutes, was also observed with AR when compared prospectively, which did not reach statistical significance (P = .11). No significant differences were seen in dose-area product or air kerma prospectively., CONCLUSIONS: Three-dimensional AR visualization of preprocedural imaging may aid in the reduction of procedural metrics in a preclinical model of transarterial embolization. These data support the need for further studies to evaluate the potential of AR in endovascular oncologic interventions. Copyright © 2020 SIR. Published by Elsevier Inc.

3350,"Age assessment by magnetic resonance imaging of the knee: A preliminary study. The authors developed an original magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) staging system for epiphyseal fusion of growth plate maturation of the knee and evaluated its reliability and validity for age assessment of living individuals. A total of 290 MRI scans of the knee were reviewed retrospectively in patients aged from 10 to 30 years old (138 males, 152 females). Five original MRI stages were defined to assess the degree of maturation of the distal femoral and proximal tibial epiphyses. Intra-observer variability was excellent and inter-observer variability was good, demonstrating the reliability and the validity of this original MRI staging system. In both sexes, the changes of growth plates (proximal tibial or distal femoral) were associated with age (p < 0.001). Our results agreed with classic data on skeletal maturation of the knee, with globally earlier maturation in females than in males, and also earlier maturation of the proximal tibial epiphysis than of the distal femoral epiphysis. MRI of the knee is an efficient non-invasive method of age assessment, without the disadvantage of X-ray exposure. Further studies with larger groups are needed to support our results. © 2011 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.",Excluded
1656,"Functional image-guided stereotactic body radiation therapy planning for patients with hepatocellular carcinoma. The aim of the current planning study is to evaluate the ability of gadoxetate disodium-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (EOB-MRI)-guided stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) planning by using intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) techniques in sparing the functional liver tissues during SBRT for hepatocellular carcinoma. In this study, 20 patients with hepatocellular carcinoma were enrolled. Functional liver tissues were defined according to quantitative liver-spleen contrast ratios >=1.5 on a hepatobiliary phase scan. Functional images were fused with the planning computed tomography (CT) images; the following 2 SBRT plans were designed using a ""step-and-shoot"" static IMRT technique for each patient: (1) an anatomical SBRT plan optimization based on the total liver; and (2) a functional SBRT plan based on the functional liver. The total prescribed dose was 48 gray (Gy) in 4 fractions. Dosimetric parameters, including dose to 95% of the planning target volume (PTV D95%), percentages of total and functional liver volumes, which received doses from 5 to 30Gy (V5 to V30 and fV5 to fV30), and mean doses to total and functional liver (MLD and fMLD, respectively) of the 2 plans were compared. Compared with anatomical plans, functional image-guided SBRT plans reduced MLD (mean: plan A, 5.5Gy; and plan F, 5.1Gy; p<0.0001) and fMLD (mean: plan A, 5.4Gy; and plan F, 4.9Gy; p<0.0001), as well as V5 to V30 and fV5 to fV30. No differences were noted in PTV coverage and nonhepatic organs at risk (OARs) doses. In conclusion, EOB-MRI-guided SBRT planning using the IMRT technique may preserve functional liver tissues in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).Copyright © 2017 American Association of Medical Dosimetrists",Excluded
1344,"Effect of constraint loading on the lower limb muscle forces in weightless treadmill exercise. Long exposure to the microgravity will lead to muscle atrophy and bone loss. Treadmill exercise could mitigate the musculoskeletal decline. But muscle atrophy remains inevitable. The constraint loading applied on astronauts could affect the muscle force and its atrophy severity. However, the quantitative correlation between constraint loading mode and muscle forces remains unclear. This study aimed to characterize the influence of constraint loading mode on the lower limb muscle forces in weightless treadmill exercise. The muscle forces in the full gait cycle were calculated with the inverse dynamic model of human musculoskeletal system. The calculated muscle forces at gravity were validated with the EMG data. Muscle forces increased at weightlessness compared with those at the earth's gravity. The increasing percentage from high to low is as follows: biceps femoris, gastrocnemius, soleus, vastus, and rectus femoris, which was in agreement with the muscle atrophy observed in astronauts. The constraint loading mode had an impact on the muscle forces in treadmill exercise and thus could be manipulated to enhance the effect of the muscle training in spaceflight. The findings could provide biomechanical basis for the optimization of treadmill constraint system and training program and improve the countermeasure efficiency in spaceflight.Copyright © 2018 Ning Guo et al.",Excluded

Purpose: To determine possibilities of photodynamic therapy (PDT) with non-coherent light sources in the blue range of the spectrum for treating streptostaphylodermias. Previously performed microbiological and spectrophotometric studies andexperimental work with animals have helped the author to choose photosensitisers and light sources for the present clinical trials. Material(s) and Method(s): PDT was done in 62-patients with superficial forms of streptostaphylodermias (28 men and-34 women) aged 17-58. In the control group there were 58 patients (27 men and 31 women) who had traditional therapy. In PDT treatment 1% gel of photosensitizer Photoditazin was applied at skin lesions one hour before irradiation. Light-emitting diode therapeutic apparatus ""AST"" (registration number FSR-2008/02720) generating light at the range 400-410nm (in the Sore band), power 500 mWt was used as a light source. 3 sessions a week, irradiation time 5-7 min at 5 cm distance. Results were assessed by changes in clinical picture, by biophotometric findings (with biophotometer ""Milta-08 1""). Changes were also fixed by a photocamera. Result(s): During the trial complete regression of skin rash was seen in 81% patients, considerable improvement in 27.5%; no changes in 11% after 4-8 PDT sessions (1.5-2.5 weeks after treatment beginning); in the control group 18%, 59% and 62%, correspondently. These findings have been confirmed by biophotometric examinations of the diseased areas on the skin: in the studied group reduction of a coefficient of reflection from the skin surface by 39%, reduction of a coefficient of reflection from deep skin layers by-23%; in the control group by 27% and 17%, correspondently. It has confirmed effectiveness and perspectiveness of the developed PDT technique. No recurrences were seen during 12 months in 75% of the studied group and in 21% in the control group.

Background and purpose: This study assessed the potential of tomotherapy based Image Guided Radiotherapy (IGRT) to increase the accuracy of bladder irradiation using a 'plan of the day' adaptive radiotherapy (ART) technique. Material(s) and Method(s): Ten patients with muscle invasive bladder cancer underwent bladder preservation with trimodality therapy in an ongoing trial. All patients received 64 Gy/32# to the whole bladder and seven of them received a boost of 68 Gy/32# to the tumour bed. The ART technique entailed the generation of six IMRT plans for each patient, using six isotropic PTVs of 5-30 mm applied to the bladder volume (CTV) to generate the PTVs. Megavoltage CT (MVCT) imaging was done to correct positioning errors and choose the 'plan of the day'. Result(s): Post treatment MVCT scans (315 scans) were used to generate multiple anisotropic PTVs for three hypothetical scenarios. Overall, coverage of anterior and superior walls required larger margins than other walls. Maximum geographical miss, in spite of IGRT, was noted for the superior (13.8%) and anterior walls (10.3%). Conclusion(s): Plan of the day ART is a feasible and promising technique for optimal treatment and dose escalation in bladder cancer. © 2011 Elsevier Ireland Ltd All rights reserved.

Background: The project aimed at determining the incidence of mandibular osteoradionecrosis (ORN) after radiotherapy, possible risk factors, and mandibular dose-volume effects in a large cohort of head and neck cancer patients (HNC). Methods: The cohort consisted of 1224 HNC patients treated with 66-68 Gy in 2007-2015 predominantly with IMRT. ORN cases were defined from clinical observations at follow-up and through hospital code diagnostics after oral-maxillofacial surgery and cross-checked with the national Danish Head and Neck Cancer database. In a nested case-control study, patients with ORN cases were matched with two controls (1:2) and pre-RT dental procedures including surgery to the mandible were documented. Multivariable Cox regression analysis was applied using demographic and treatment variables including dental procedures, smoking and tumor characteristics, and combined with dosimetric data. Mean mandibular dose (Dmean) was pre-selected for the multivariable model. Results: ORN was recorded in 56 cases (4.6%) with a median time to event of 10.9 months (range 1.8-89.7) after RT, 90% occurred within 37.4 months. Median follow-up time was 22 months (0.3-95). Average Dmean was significantly higher in the ORN event cohort and significant dose-volume differences were observed for population mean DVH doses between 30 Gy and 60 Gy. In univariable analysis, smoking (HR = 1.69; CI 1.14-2.5), pre-RT surgery/tooth extraction (HR = 2.76; 1.48-5.14), and several dosimetric parameters including Dmean (HR = 1.05, 1.02-1.08) were all significantly associated with ORN. Dmean and surgery/tooth extraction remained significant predictors of ORN in multivariable analysis, HR = 1.04 (CI 1.01-1.07) and HR = 2.09 (CI 1.1-3.98), respectively, while smoking only retained its significance in an interaction analysis with pre-RT dental procedures. Conclusion: The onset of ORN of the mandible was early (median 10.8 months) and the incidence low (4.6%) after IMRT in HNC cancer patients.

OBJECTIVE: To compare the diagnostic performance of adaptive statistical iterative reconstruction applied low-dose computed tomography (CT) (LDCT) with that of the standard-dose CT (SDCT) for local recurrence in patients with stomach cancer. METHOD(S): Seventy-nine consecutive patients who had undergone surgical resection for stomach cancer were enrolled. To monitor recurrence, SDCT (120 kilovolt peak [kVp], 200mAs) had been performed. The LDCT (120 kVp, 100 mA s) was taken, and images were reconstructed with 4 levels of adaptive statistical iterative reconstruction (ASIR) blending (0%, 30%, 50%, and 70%). Two blinded radiologists recorded the diagnostic confidence scores for local recurrence in each data set using a 5-point scale. Endoscopic biopsy results served as the reference standard. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis was used to calculate the diagnostic performance. RESULT(S): The diagnostic performance of LDCT with variable ASIR blending ratios was comparable to that of SDCT (area under ROC curve, 0.727-0.734, 0.687, respectively, P > 0.05). CONCLUSION(S): The diagnostic performance of ASIR applied LDCT is comparable to that of SDCT. Copyright © 2014 by Lippincott Williams &Wilkins.",Excluded
1080,"Comparing different analysis methods for quantifying the MRI amide proton transfer (APT) effect in hyperacute stroke patients. Amide proton transfer (APT) imaging is a pH mapping method based on the chemical exchange saturation transfer phenomenon that has potential for penumbra identification following stroke. The majority of the literature thus far has focused on generating pH-weighted contrast using magnetization transfer ratio asymmetry analysis instead of quantitative pH mapping. In this study, the widely used asymmetry analysis and a model-based analysis were both assessed on APT data collected from healthy subjects (n = 2) and hyperacute stroke patients (n = 6, median imaging time after onset = 2 hours 59 minutes). It was found that the model-based approach was able to quantify the APT effect with the lowest variation in grey and white matter (<= 13.8 %) and the smallest average contrast between these two tissue types (3.48 %) in the healthy volunteers. The model-based approach also performed quantitatively better than the other measures in the hyperacute stroke patient APT data, where the quantified APT effect in the infarct core was consistently lower than in the contralateral normal appearing tissue for all the patients recruited, with the group average of the quantified APT effect being 1.5 +/- 0.3 % (infarct core) and 1.9 +/- 0.4 % (contralateral). Based on the fitted parameters from the model-based analysis and a previously published pH and amide proton exchange rate relationship, quantitative pH maps for hyperacute stroke patients were generated, for the first time, using APT imaging.

Objectives: Although mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue lymphoma (MALToma) is sensitive to radiation therapy (RT), the optimal RT dose and treatment volumes have not been established. This study aimed to assess the relapse patterns and outcomes of patients with orbital MALToma who underwent RT and to suggest implications for optimized RT. Method(s): We reviewed 212 patients (246 orbits) diagnosed with orbital MALToma who received RT between 1993 and 2013. Median RT dose was 25.2 Gy. Generally, conjunctival and eyelid lesions were irradiated with electrons, whereas retrobulbar and lacrimal gland lesions with photons. Lens shielding was used for 70% of treated eyes, mainly conjunctival and eyelid tumors. Result(s): Relapse occurred in 29 patients. Among 11 patients with local relapse (LR), 4 were attributed to insufficient dose (n = 2) and improper RT volume (n = 2). The 10-year LR, contralateral orbit relapse, and distant relapse rates were 8.6%, 12.8% and 4.9%, respectively. Twelve patients died of disease-specific causes (n = 1) and intercurrent diseases (n = 11). The 10-year relapse-free survival, overall survival, and cause-specific survival rates were 69.7%, 88.2% and 98.8%, respectively. Grade 3 cataracts and nasolacrimal duct obstruction were observed in 27 and 4 orbits, respectively. Conclusion(s): Low-dose RT with proper lens shielding is an appropriate treatment for orbital MALToma in terms of high disease control rate and acceptable morbidity. However, lower RT dose may be attempted to further reduce toxicity while maintaining excellent outcomes.Copyright © The Author(s) 2019.",Excluded
14,"Risk of oxidative damage and bone resorption from increased iron stores during space flight. An increased amount of stored iron from neocytolysis of red blood cells and a high dietary intake of iron during space flight have raised concern about the risk of excess iron causing oxidative damage, particularly in bone. To investigate this risk, biomarkers of iron status, oxidative damage, and bone resorption during space flight were analyzed for 23 (16 M/7 F) International Space Station crewmembers. As many as 5 in-flight blood samples and 24-h urine pools were collected from each crewmember. Serum iron increased slightly during space flight and decreased at landing (P < 0.0004). An increase in serum ferritin early in flight (217% in women and 68% in men, P < 0.0004), returning to preflight concentrations at landing, and a decrease in transferrin and transferrin receptors during flight indicated that a transient increase in iron stores occurred. No inflammatory response was observed during flight. The oxidative damage markers 8-hydroxy-2'- deoxyguanosine and prostaglandin F2alpha were positively correlated (both P < 0.001) with serum ferritin. A greater area under the curve for ferritin during flight was correlated with greater changes in bone mineral density of several bone regions after flight. The results suggest that increased iron stores do constitute a risk factor for oxidative damage and bone resorption, during space flight and on Earth.",Excluded

2009,"Allograft alone versus allograft with bone marrow concentrate for the healing of the instrumented posterolateral lumbar fusion. Background context Spondylodesis in the operative management of lumbar spine diseases has been the subject of numerous studies over several decades. The posterolateral fusion (PLF) with pedicle screw fixation is a commonly used procedure. Purpose To determine whether the addition of bone marrow concentrate (BMC) to allograft bone increases fusion rate after instrumented posterior lumbar fusion. Study design The study was prospective, randomized, controlled, and blinded. Methods Eighty patients with degenerative disease of the lumbar spine underwent instrumented lumbar or lumbosacral PLF (22 men, 58 women; body mass index less than 35 for a good visualization of the PLF in the X-rays). In 40 cases, the PLF was done with spongious allograft chips alone (Group I, age 62.7 years in average, range 47-77 years, level of fusion 1-2). In another 40 cases, spongious allograft chips were mixed with BMC (Group II, age 58.5 years in average, range 42-80, level of fusion 1-3), including the mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs). Patients were scheduled for anteroposterior and lateral radiographs 12 and 24 months after the surgery and for computed tomography scanning 24 months after the surgery. Fusion status and the degree of mineralization of the fusion mass were evaluated separately by two radiologists blinded to patient group affiliation. The bony mass was judged as fused if there was uninterrupted bridging of well-mineralized bone between the transverse processes or sacrum, with trabeculation indicating bone maturation on least at one side of the spines. Results In Group I at 12 months, the bone graft mass was assessed in X-rays as fused in no cases (0%) and at 24 months in four cases (10%). In Group II, 6 cases (15%) achieved fusion at 12 months and 14 cases (35%) at 24 months. The statistically significant difference between both groups was proven for complete fusion at both 12 (p=.041) and 24 months (p=.011). Computed tomography scans showed that 16 cases (40%) in Group I and 32 cases (80%) in Group II had evidence of at least unilateral continuous bridging bone between neighboring vertebrae at 24 months (p<.05). Conclusions We have confirmed the hypothesis that the autologous BMC together with the allograft is a better alternative for PLF than the allograft alone. The use of autologous MSCs in form of BMC in combination with allograft is an effective option to enhance the PLF healing. © 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.",Excluded
607,"DNA damage-induced PARP1 activation confers cardiomyocyte dysfunction through NAD+ depletion in experimental atrial fibrillation. Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common clinical tachyarrhythmia with a strong tendency to progress in time. AF progression is driven by derailment of protein homeostasis, which ultimately causes contractile dysfunction of the atria. Here we report that tachypacing-induced functional loss of atrial cardiomyocytes is precipitated by excessive poly(ADP)-ribose polymerase 1 (PARP1) activation in response to oxidative DNA damage. PARP1-mediated synthesis of ADP-ribose chains in turn depletes nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+), induces further DNA damage and contractile dysfunction. Accordingly, NAD+ replenishment or PARP1 depletion precludes functional loss. Moreover, inhibition of PARP1 protects against tachypacing-induced NAD+ depletion, oxidative stress, DNA damage and contractile dysfunction in atrial cardiomyocytes and Drosophila. Consistently, cardiomyocytes of persistent AF patients show significant DNA damage, which correlates with PARP1 activity. The findings uncover a mechanism by which tachypacing impairs cardiomyocyte function and implicates PARP1 as a possible therapeutic target that may preserve cardiomyocyte function in clinical AF.Copyright © 2019, The Author(s).",Excluded

To investigate the influence of a 3D image-based treatment-planning method for high-dose-rate interstitial brachytherapy (HDR-ISBT) for mobile tongue cancer, we analyzed dose-volume histogram results for the clinical target volume (CTV) and the mandible. Between October 2010 and November 2011, one and four patients having T2 and T3 tumors, respectively, were treated with HDR-ISBT. Multiplane implantation using 9-15 treatment applicators was performed. Lugol's iodine staining, metal markers, ultrasonography, and magnetic resonance imaging were used to identify the contours of the gross tumor volume (defined as the CTV). The results of the image-based treatment plan were compared with those of the conventional simulated plan on the basis of a reference point 5 mm from the applicator position. The mean D90(CTV) and V100(CTV) were 112% of the prescribed dose (PD) and 98.1%PD, respectively, for the image-based plan, and 113%PD and 97.2%PD, respectively, for the conventional plan. The median CTVref/Vref was 0.23 for the image-based plan and 0.16 for the conventional plan (P = 0.01).

763,"Relationship between prognosis of papillary thyroid carcinoma patient and age: a retrospective single-institution study. Age is an important prognostic factor in papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC). In this study, we investigated the difference in prognosis of 7 subsets of PTC patients without distant metastasis at presentation or a history of radiation exposure (20 years or younger, 21-30 years, 31-40 years, 41-50 years, 51-60 years, 61-70 years, and older than 70 years). The lymph node recurrence rate was high in patients 20 years or younger and those older than 60 years. Distant recurrence and carcinoma death rates significantly elevated in patients older than 60 years. The incidence of significant extrathyroid extension markedly increased with age, although that of large node metastasis or extranodal tumor extension did not differ much among the 7 subsets. With the Kaplan-Meier method, lymph node recurrence rate was poor in patients 20 years or younger and in those older than 60 years. Poor distant recurrence-free and cause specific survivals of patients older than 60 years were identified in the series of PTC patients with and without these aggressive features. It is therefore suggested that 1) Lymph node recurrence rate was high in patients 20 years or younger and those older than 60 years and 2) prognosis, including distant recurrence-free survival and cause-specific survival, of patients older than 60 years was poor regardless of clinicopathological features of PTC at initial surgery.",Excluded
652,"Clinical outcomes of radiotherapy for spinal cord ependymoma with adverse prognostic features: a single-center study. Purpose: This study evaluated the outcomes of radiotherapy (RT) for spinal ependymoma with adverse features, such as incomplete resection or disseminated disease. Method(s): Twenty-five patients underwent RT for spinal cord ependymoma during 1991-2016. Twenty-four patients had gross disease on the pre-RT spinal magnetic resonance images. Six patients (24%) had disseminated disease. The World Health Organization grades were I (12 patients), II (12 patients), and III (1 patient). The RT fields were the tumor bed plus margin in 19 patients (76%), the entire craniospinal axis in 5 patients (20%), and the entire spinal canal with posterior cranial fossa in 1 patient (4%). The median RT dose was 50.4 Gy (range 44.0-59.4 Gy). Result(s): The median follow-up was 49 months (range 9-321 months), with 5-year overall and progression-free survival rates of 83.7% and 70.8%, respectively. Relative to patients with grade II/III ependymoma, patients with grade I ependymoma had higher 5-year rates of overall survival (100% vs. 69.4%, P =.088) and progression-free survival (100% vs. 42.3%, P =.02). Disease progression was observed in 4 patients who had grade II ependymoma, including 2 of 6 patients with disseminated disease and 2 of 19 patients with localized disease. Twelve patients (48%) exhibited improved neurological function. One patient who underwent craniospinal irradiation developed late hypopituitarism. No other RT-related late toxicities were observed. Conclusion(s): Favorable survival outcomes were achieved using RT for spinal ependymoma with adverse prognostic features.

3076,"Reduction of healthcare-associated infections in a long-term care brain injury ward by replacing regular linens with biocidal copper oxide impregnated linens. Background: Contaminated textiles in hospitals contribute to endogenous, indirect-contact, and aerosol transmission of nosocomial related pathogens. Copper oxide impregnated linens have wide-spectrum antimicrobial, antifungal, and antiviral properties. Our aim was to determine if replacing non-biocidal linens with biocidal copper oxide impregnated linens would reduce the rates of healthcare-associated infections (HAI) in a long-term care ward. Method(s): We compared the rates of HAI in two analogous patient cohorts in a head injury care ward over two 6-month parallel periods before (period A) and after (period B) replacing all the regular non-biocidal linens and personnel uniforms with copper oxide impregnated biocidal products. Result(s): During period B, in comparison to period A, there was a 24% reduction in the HAI per 1000 hospitalization-days (p< 0.05), a 47% reduction in the number of fever days (>38.5. degreeC) per 1000 hospitalization-days (p< 0.01), and a 32.8% reduction in total number of days of antibiotic administration per 1000 hospitalization-days (p< 0.0001). Accordingly there was saving of approximately 27% in costs of antibiotics, HAI-related treatments, X-rays, disposables, labor, and laundry, expenses during period B.

1541,"A guide to mammography and other breast imaging procedures. Mammographic studies are performed for both diagnosis of breast disease and screening for cancer. Diagnostic mammography can demonstrate the presence of breast cancer in a symptomatic patient and more specifically, the size, location and extent of tumor. Mammographic screening involves examination of asymptomatic women in an attempt to detect breast cancer before it grows large enough to be palpable. The use of diagnostic mammography is well accepted due to the compelling clinical need for the information provided. The implementation of a mammographic screening program depends upon: (1) indication of a favorable benefit/risk ratio for the population being screened; (2) availability of suitably trained radiologists, medical physicists, and technologists and appropriate mammographic equipment subject to a vigorous QA program; and (3) acceptably low cost. Breast anatomy and function must be understood (Section 2) in order to design and utilize the mammographie techniques which will effectively detect and demonstrate breast cancer. The technique which is employed for the preponderance of mammography examinations is screen-film mammography with a grid. Good screen-film mammography requires dedicated equipment which can provide an appropriate soft x-ray beam (proper choice of operating potential, target, filter, window, HVL) (Section 3), proper compression, a target-film distance of suitable length for the given focal-spot size, and provision for vertical adjustment and mechanical rotation of the tube and image-receptor assembly for proper positioning (Section 2). The two views, which are recommended, are the CC and the MLO view (Section 2) which allow more visualization of the posterior glandular tissues, particularly in the auxiliary tail than a lateral view. The lateral view should also be employed whenever a nonpalpable lesion is discovered, in order to provide accurate three-dimensional localization. Screen-film mammography should be performed by a technologist who has had special training in compression and positioning techniques for the standard and special views used for mammography (ACR, 1999). Only an intensifying screen designed specifically for mammography should be used in combination with a suitable single-emulsion film (Section 3). The combination should be placed in low-absorption cassettes designed for mammography. There are many factors which affect image quality (Section 4). The three major components of image quality are contrast, sharpness and noise. Image quality can be optimized by suitable adjustment of the x-ray spectrum (operating potential, filtration, target material), breast compression, grids, imaging geometry (small focal spot, long target-film distance), choice of screens and films, and optimization of film-processing techniques. Image quality may be checked with suitable phantoms. Section 4 provides information to allow facilities to determine whether the particular combination of x-ray machine, compression devices, technique factors and image receptors in current use, or under consideration for use, for mammography will provide optimum image quality. A major objective of mammography dosimetry is to provide relevant information so that potential radiation risks from alternative techniques may be compared. For this purpose a single-valued dose"" per view for each technique, which corresponds reasonably well to the resulting carcinogenic potential, should be determined. This task involves consideration of tissue vulnerability to radiation effects, anatomy, technique and dosimetry. In addition, a unique dose value for each technique requires that the dose be determined for a fixed-reference breast composition with breast thickness stated. Simple computational models of the breast have been developed for estimation of mammographic dose. Several assumptions are implicit in these models relating to radiation risk, breast anatomy, and technique (Section 5). Three specific points are relevant to radiation risk: (1) breast glandular tissue is most vulnerable as compared with adipose, skin and areo ar tissues; (2) an average breast dose (namely, the mean glandular dose), rather than a maximum dose, is most useful in characterizing risk of carcinogenesis consistent with a linear dose-response relationship; and (3) the population of primary interest is women 40 y and older since younger women are likely to receive only diagnostic and baseline studies. This assumption that the population of primary interest is women 40 y and older limits application of the computational models to the older on average, more adipose breast, which helps justify certain simplifying assumptions. A major technique variable is the degree of compression employed. Firm compression, which is assumed in dose computations, greatly distorts the breast anatomy, making more rectangular the sagittal and transverse cross-sections of the volume that includes the glandular tissue. This greatly simplifies the breast geometry and makes the computational models more appropriate than otherwise would be the case (Section 5). The mean glandular dose (D<inf>g</inf>) meets the stated requirements outlined above. The computational model used in this Report for D<inf>g</inf> assumes that 0.5 cm thick adipose layers enclose a central ""glandular tissue"" containing a uniform mix of glandular and adipose tissues in roughly equal amounts. The procedure for estimating mean glandular dose for a specific population of patients is described in Table 4.3 (Approach II). A basic requirement for maintaining optimum image quality in mammography is implementation of a suitable QA program (Section 6). Each of the items contributing to image quality must be evaluated on a regular basis. The quality administration program (medical audit) evaluates the appropriateness and accuracy of image interpretation (Section 6.3). The benefit from screening by mammography and physical examination in the form of decreased breast cancer mortality has long been accepted for women above age 50 on the basis of a randomized trial (the HIP study, see Section 7), which indicated that the contribution of mammography to decreased breast cancer mortality was significant in older women. The randomized clinical trials of mammographic screening have not demonstrated a benefit for women age 40 to 49, within the first 7 y of starting screening. Those trials for which 10 or more years of follow-up is available, show evidence of a 23 percent benefit in reducing mortality. Although this reduction is smaller than that observed for older women, it is statistically significant and therefore, one can reject the possibility that this may have happened by chance. Compared with mammography practiced in the previous randomized trials, high-quality modern mammography could result in increased benefit. Even a very small benefit (e.g., one percent) more than offsets any risk of radiation-induced breast cancer. The benefit versus risk will be substantial, if analysis of ongoing screening experience demonstrates a reduction in breast cancer mortality rate of 30 percent or more. Among the various imaging methods designed to evaluate the breast for cancer, mammography is the most accurate and most widely used. It has gained clinical acceptance primarily because of its ability to detect a cancer before the tumor mass becomes large enough to be palpable, thereby permitting ""early"" diagnosis. It has also been proven an invaluable tool to distinguish benign from malignant lesions and can facilitate prompt biopsy of cancers, while encouraging clinical observation (rather than biopsy) of many benign masses. Other breast imaging methods have, thus far, been considered less successful; these include thermography, transillumination, ultrasonography, and MRI and MRS all of which do not utilize ionizing radiation. Computed tomography (Section 8.4) and digital mammography (Section 3.3) which use x rays, and therefore involve the potential risk of mammary carcinogenesis are being subjected to clinical investigation to determine their role in breast cancer diagnosis. Explanations of the principles of operation, a chronology of developments, an an extensive discussion of the limitations of each of these methods is contained in Sections 3.3 and 8.4.""",Excluded

Background: Topical photodynamic therapy (PDT) mediated with 5-aminolevulinic acid (ALA) offers an alternative option for the treatment of acne vulgaris. Objective(s): To study the effects of ALA dose, incubation time, and lesion type on protoporphyrin IX (PpIX) production and treatment outcomes. Method(s): To examine the time course of PpIX production, 10% ALA was applied to inflammatory papules for 1 to 5 hours and followed by in situ fluorescence examination. To determine the effects of ALA dose and lesion type, 3, 5, and 10% ALA was applied to acne lesions in split-face fashion for 3 hours followed by whole-face light irradiation at 633 nm and 30 to 70 J/cm2. Treatment was repeated twice at 2-week intervals. Result(s): PpIX reached a stable level after 3 hours of incubation. Similar PpIX levels were seen in areas receiving 3, 5, and 10% ALA. Poisson regression analyses indicated that lesion counts decreased by 0.791 times for a one-unit increase in treatment times (95% CI 0.782-0.799, p < .0001) but only by 0.999 times for a one-unit increase in ALA dose (95% CI 0.998-1.000, p = .22).

1475,"Variant Splicing and Influence of Ionizing Radiation on Human Endogenous Retrovirus K (HERV-K) Transcripts in Cancer Cell Lines. Human endogenous retrovirus K (HERV-K) is the most intact retrovirus in the human genome. There are multiple full-length or near full-length HERV-K proviruses in it. To analyze which HERV-K proviruses give rise to viral transcripts in cancer cell lines and to test whether ionizing radiation can alter the levels of HERV-K transcripts, RT-PCR studies were undertaken using multiple human cancer cell lines. Primers from several positions in the viral genome were used and included pairs designed to cross splice junctions in viral RNAs. In the absence of ionizing radiation, transcripts were detected from multiple HERV-K proviruses in cell lines from human prostate, cervical, head and neck, or breast cancers, and the proviruses from which the transcripts originated varied among the different lines. Only one of 13 cell lines tested (cervical cancer line C33A) failed to show HERV-K transcripts. Spliced RNAs detected included viral RNAs spliced as expected at the conventional viral splice sites, plus several alternatively spliced RNAs. Alternatively spliced transcripts arose from specific proviruses, and were detected in most of the cell lines used. Quantitative RT-PCR was performed to assess the effects of ionizing radiation. These analyses showed that HERV-K transcripts were elevated in four of twelve lines tested, specifically all three prostate cancer lines used and one breast cancer line. The increases were transient, peaking at 24 hours following a single dose of gamma-irradiation that ranged from 2.5 to 20 Gy, and returning to baseline levels by 72 hours. In summary, these studies showed that ionizing radiation can affect the levels of HERV-K transcripts in cells, and these effects vary among different cells. The changes in HERV-K transcript levels might affect multiple biological processes in cells, and future studies of the effects of ionizing radiation on HERV-K are worth pursuing. © 2013 Agoni et al.",Excluded
2794,"Improvement in automated quantitation of myocardial perfusion abnormality by using iterative reconstruction image in combination with resolution recovery, attenuation and scatter corrections for the detection of coronary artery disease. OBJECTIVE: An iterative reconstruction method in combination with resolution recovery, attenuation and scatter corrections (IR-RASC) can improve image quality. It, however, is undetermined whether this technique can improve the detection of coronary artery disease (CAD) when automated quantitative analysis is used. This study evaluated diagnostic values of IR-RASC in combination with automated quantitative analysis in stress myocardial perfusion imaging (MPI) in the CAD detection., METHODS: This study enrolled consecutive 64 patients (mean age 66.2 +/- 17.3 years, 39 males) who had undergone both 99mTc-labeled tetrofosmin stress MPI and coronary angiography within 3 months. Stress MPI abnormalities quantified as summed stress score (SSS), summed rest score (SRS) and summed difference score (SDS) by Heart Risk View-S (HRV-S) and Quantitative Perfusion SPECT (QPS) softwares using IR-RASC images were compared with those by using conventional filtered back-projection method (FBP) images and angiographic findings., RESULTS: Based on expert visual assessment, SSS and SRS by HRV-S/QPS softwares with IR-RASC were significantly lower than those by HRV-S/QPS softwares with FBP at mid- and basal left ventricular segments. Receiver-operating characteristics analysis showed that areas under the curve assessed by HRV-S (0.687) and QPS (0.678) with IR-RASC were nearly identical to those (0.717-0.724) by expert assessment with FBP, and were significantly (P < 0.05) greater than those by HRV-S (0.505) and QPS (0.522) with FBP. When HRV-S was used, the specificity and diagnostic accuracy of IR-RASC in the CAD detection were significantly greater than those of FBP: 90.3 versus 51.6%, P < 0.0001 and 79.7 versus 54.7%, P = 0.0027, respectively. Likewise, when QPS was used, the specificity and diagnostic accuracy of IR-RASC in the CAD detection were significantly greater than those of FBP: 80.6 versus 41.9%, P < 0.0001, and 78.1 versus 51.6%, P = 0.0018, respectively.

The use of the beta-emitter 90Sr/Y significantly reduced treatment time and operator exposure compared with previous trials with the gamma-emitter 192Ir. Conclusions - In this study, the administration of endovascular beta-radiation after angioplasty was safe and feasible and substantially altered the postangioplasty late lumen loss, resulting in a lower-than-expected rate of restenosis. On the basis of these encouraging results, a multicenter, randomized trial with operators and patients blinded to treatment assignment is planned.",Excluded
513,"Perfusion MRI detects rCBF abnormalities in early stages of HIV-cognitive motor complex. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate patients with early HIV-cognitive motor complex (HIV-CMC) for possible regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) abnormalities on perfusion MRI (pMRI)., BACKGROUND: Nuclear medicine techniques have demonstrated global and focal cerebral perfusion abnormalities in patients with HIV dementia. Ultrafast pMRI enables the measurement of rCBF throughout the brain without the need to apply radioactive tracers or ionizing radiation., METHODS: pMRI was used to measure the rCBF in 19 patients with early stages of HIV-CMC and 15 healthy seronegative control subjects. The rCBF maps were registered to high-resolution anatomic MRI scans and transformed into Talairach space. Statistical analysis of the rCBF maps was performed with SPM96., RESULTS: Compared with the control subjects, the patients with HIV had statistically significantly decreased rCBF bilaterally in the inferior lateral frontal cortices (right: -15%, p < 0.002; left: -12%, p < 0.005) and in the inferior medial parietal brain region (-15%, p < 0.0009). In contrast, rCBF was increased bilaterally in the posterior inferior parietal white matter (right: +19%, p < 0.0001; left: + 17%, p < 0.001). Furthermore, rCBF abnormalities correlated significantly with clinical disease severity as measured by CD4 count, plasma viral load, Karnofsky score, and HIV dementia scale., DISCUSSION: Our results are consistent with previous findings from PET and SPECT studies. Furthermore, pMRI can detect rCBF abnormalities that correlate with disease severity in HIV-CMC. Because pMRI is more cost-effective, faster, and safer than nuclear medicine techniques for monitoring rCBF changes, pMRI may be more feasible for monitoring the effects of therapy for HIV-CMC.",Excluded
1383,"Therapeutic applications of PARP inhibitors: Anticancer therapy and beyond. The aim of this article is to describe the current and potential clinical translation of pharmacological inhibitors of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) for the therapy of various diseases. The first section of the present review summarizes the available preclinical and clinical data with PARP inhibitors in various forms of cancer. In this context, the role of PARP in single-strand DNA break repair is relevant, leading to replication-associated lesions that cannot be repaired if homologous recombination repair (HRR) is defective, and the synthetic lethality of PARP inhibitors in HRR-defective cancer. HRR defects are classically associated with BRCA1 and 2 mutations associated with familial breast and ovarian cancer, but there may be many other causes of HRR defects. Thus, PARP inhibitors may be the drugs of choice for BRCA mutant breast and ovarian cancers, and extend beyond these tumors if appropriate biomarkers can be developed to identify HRR defects. Multiple lines of preclinical data demonstrate that PARP inhibition increases cytotoxicity and tumor growth delay in combination with temozolomide, topoisomerase inhibitors and ionizing radiation. Both single agent and combination clinical trials are underway. The final part of the first section of the present review summarizes the current status of the various PARP inhibitors that are in various stages of clinical development. The second section of the present review summarizes the role of PARP in selected non-oncologic indications. In a number of severe, acute diseases (such as stroke, neurotrauma, circulatory shock and acute myocardial infarction) the clinical translatability of PARP inhibition is supported by multiple lines of preclinical data, as well as observational data demonstrating PARP activation in human tissue samples. In these disease indications, PARP overactivation due to oxidative and nitrative stress drives cell necrosis and pro-inflammatory gene expression, which contributes to disease pathology. Accordingly, multiple lines of preclinical data indicate the efficacy of PARP inhibitors to preserve viable tissue and to down-regulate inflammatory responses. As the clinical trials with PARP inhibitors in various forms of cancer progress, it is hoped that a second line of clinical investigations, aimed at testing of PARP inhibitors for various non-oncologic indications, will be initiated, as well. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

1894,"Pedicled perforator flap of stellate design. The perforator flap has proven to be effective as both a free flap and a pedicled flap in the reconstruction of a variety of regions. Usually, a V-Y advancement pattern or simple ellipse is the design selected for pedicled perforator island flaps. On the other hand, the transposition of multiple perforator flaps or skin grafting on the donor sites is required for larger defects. The authors used a stellate design to elevate a perforator flap with large dimensions, whilst allowing the easier closure of the donor defect. This method was used for reconstructing the sacral (six cases), trochanteric (one case), and lower leg (three cases) regions. Although minor wound dehiscence at the donor sites was encountered in three cases, all the defects were reconstructed successfully using a single perforator flap. This design would be a valuable option for planning a pedicled perforator flap, particularly when a difficult donor closure is expected.",Excluded
1817,"Reduction of radiation exposure in cryoballoon ablation procedures: a single-centre study applying intracardiac echocardiography and other radioprotective measures. Aims: The population treated with cryoballoon (CB) ablation is relatively young, and radiation protection is of major importance. We aimed to demonstrate that radiation exposure can be markedly reduced by intracardiac echocardiography (ICE) and optimized settings of the X-ray system., Methods and results: We analysed 100 patients undergoing CB pulmonary vein isolation (PVI) for treatment of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation. In 50 consecutive patients (25 male, 59 +/- 13 years; Group 1), we used ICE, skipped PV angiography prior to CB inflation, and avoided fluoroscopy whenever possible. Furthermore, we reduced the frame rate, minimized distance between patient and detector, and consequently applied collimation. These patients were compared with 50 similar preceding patients in Group 2 (29 male, 61 +/- 12 years). Total fluoroscopy time was reduced from 18 +/- 6 min in Group 2 to 12 +/- 5 min in Group 1 (P < 0.001). Moreover, the dose area product was significantly lower (1555 +/- 1219 vs. 4935 +/- 2094 cGycm2, P < 0.001), total freezing time was significantly shortened (1855 +/- 399 vs. 2121 +/- 756 s, P = 0.031), and contrast media use was significantly reduced (66 +/- 25 vs. 109 +/- 27 mL, P < 0.001). At the same time, total procedure duration and complication rates did not differ significantly between both groups. After a 12 months follow-up, a similar percentage of patients was free from recurrences (74% in Group 1 vs. 78% in Group 2, P = 0.640)., Conclusion: Radiation exposure in CB PVI can be markedly reduced without prolonging procedure times, affecting the outcome or complication rates. Moreover, ICE seems to shorten total freezing time. Copyright Published on behalf of the European Society of Cardiology. All rights reserved. © The Author 2016.

2236,"Neoadjuvant therapy reduces the incidence of nodal micrometastases in esophageal adenocarcinoma. Background We evaluated the impact of neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy (CRT) on nodal micrometastases (NMMs) in esophageal adenocarcinoma (EAC) patients with histologically negative nodes ([y]pN0). Methods Of 48 consecutively treated patients with neoadjuvant CRT, we selected 20 EAC ypN0 patients (group 1). These patients were matched with 20 pN0 EAC patients who had surgery alone (group 2). Harvested (y)pN0 lymph nodes were examined immunohistochemically (anti-CK8/18 [CAM 5.2]) according to a validated sentinel node protocol. A 3rd group (n = 11) staged as ypN1 after neoadjuvant CRT was used as the control group. Results Upstaging to NMM+ occurred in 2 patients (10%) in group 1 and in 8 patients (40%) in group 2 (P =.028). Disease-free and overall survival rates in NMM+ patients in group 1 were worse compared with NMM- patients (P =.014 and P =.003, respectively) but comparable with ypN1 patients (n = 11). Conclusions A 30% reduction of NMM+ was obtained after neoadjuvant treatment in (y)pN0 patients. NMM+ after CRT had a negative impact on survival in ypN1 patients. These data warrant further investigation in larger prospective datasets. © 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.",Excluded
3637,"The effect of anatomical modeling on space radiation dose estimates: A comparison of doses for NASA phantoms and the 5th, 50th, and 95th percentile male and female astronauts. The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) performs organ dosimetry and risk assessment for astronauts using model-normalized measurements of the radiation fields encountered in space. To determine the radiation fields in an organ or tissue of interest, particle transport calculations are performed using self-shielding distributions generated with the computer program CAMERA to represent the human body. CAMERA mathematically traces linear rays (or path lengths) through the computerized anatomical man (CAM) phantom, a computational stylized model developed in the early 1970s with organ and body profiles modeled using solid shapes and scaled to represent the body morphometry of the 1950 50th percentile (PCTL) Air Force male. With the increasing use of voxel phantoms in medical and health physics, a conversion from a mathematical-based to a voxel-based ray-tracing algorithm is warranted. In this study, the voxel-based ray tracer (VoBRaT) is introduced to ray trace voxel phantoms using a modified version of the algorithm first proposed by Siddon (1985 Med. Phys. 12 252-5). After validation, VoBRAT is used to evaluate variations in body self-shielding distributions for NASA phantoms and six University of Florida (UF) hybrid phantoms, scaled to represent the 5th, 50th, and 95th PCTL male and female astronaut body morphometries, which have changed considerably since the inception of CAM. These body self-shielding distributions are used to generate organ dose equivalents and effective doses for five commonly evaluated space radiation environments. It is found that dosimetric differences among the phantoms are greatest for soft radiation spectra and light vehicular shielding. 2011 Institute of Physics and Engineering in Medicine.",Excluded
3165,"Patient-reported versus physiologic swallowing outcomes in patients with head and neck cancer after chemoradiation. Objective: The primary objective of this project was to retrospectively investigate the relationship between patient-reported and physiologic swallowing measures after chemoradiation therapy for head neck cancer (HNC). Method(s): Adult patients who underwent chemoradiation therapy for HNC and presented for videofluoroscopic swallow study were reviewed retrospectively. Surgically treated patients were excluded. Patient perception of swallowing-related outcomes was assessed via the MD Anderson Dysphagia Inventory (MDADI) on the same day that physiologic measures of swallow function were obtained. Using vidoefluoroscopic data, the Dynamic Imaging Grade of Swallowing Toxicity (DIGEST) scale yielded measures of safety (DIGEST-S: penetration/aspiration) and efficiency (DIGEST-E: residue). Statistical analysis for correlation coefficients was performed. Result(s): Thirty patients met the inclusion criteria. The oropharynx was the most commonly affected site (70.0%), followed by the larynx (16.7%). The median radiation dose was 72 grays (Gy), and participants were assessed a mean of 4.6 (range 0-12) years following completion of treatment. There was no correlation between the MDADI and the DIGEST-E score (Pearson rho = -0.045, P = 0.812), DIGEST-S score (Pearson rho = 0.075, P = 0.695), or summary DIGEST grade (Pearson rho = 0.046, P = 0.810). MDADI scores did not change significantly with increasing time since radiation (P = 0.375), whereas the DIGEST-E scores, DIGEST-S score, and summary DIGEST grades worsened over time (P = 0.007, P = 0.002, and P = 0.0005, respectively). Conclusion(s): Assessment of swallowing physiology showed that function worsened after chemoradiation therapy, but this did not correlate with patient-reported quality-of-life measures. Reduced patient awareness of swallow dysfunction years after completion of chemoradiation has implications for management of dysphagia in the face of physiologic decline. Level of Evidence: 4.

Aim of this controlled prospective study was to find out the long time effect of repeated radon mine inhalation therapy on patients with ankylosing spondylitis concerning their consumption of NSAIDS and their complications of the gastrointestinuum. 100 patients with definite ankylosing spondylitis and with repeated rehabilitation-therapy within 12 years were asked about their consumption of NSAIDS (days per week) and about occurring of in patient treatment because of severe complications of the gastrointestinuum. Additionally they reported their examinations of the gastrointestinuum and their use of gastroprotective medication (PPI). Several sociodemographic parameters and some more medical parameters were observed. Treatment group (n = 49) and control group (n = 51) had about 6 in-patient rehabilitation treatments within the period of 12 years, in the treatment group additionally radon mine inhalation therapy was given. Compared to the beginning of the study consumption of NSAIDS after 12 years was only reduced in the treatment group (p < 0,05). Severe complications of the gastrointestinuum followed by in patient treatment were reported by 18 % of the control group and 5% of the treatment group. Bleeding complications only occurred in the control group.

Background: Induction chemotherapy followed by concurrent chemoradiotherapy is one of the standards of care for patients with nasopharyngeal carcinoma, but the optimal number of induction cycles is unclear. Here we compared survival data from patients treated with 2 to 4 cycles. Method(s): Patients with nasopharyngeal carcinoma at West China Hospital of Sichuan University between January 2009 and December 2015 were retrospectively analyzed. Result(s): Six hundred and seventy three patients met eligibility criteria. After a median follow-up of 53 months (interquartile range, 38-74), there was no difference between 2 and 3 cycles in overall survival (88.14% vs 91.24%). But four cycles were associated with worse overall survival (79.12%) and higher incidence of treatment-related toxicities. Multivariate analysis showed that the number of induction cycles and lymph node classification were prognostic factors. Conclusion(s): Two and three cycles of induction chemotherapy are associated with similar survival, while four cycles reduce survival and increase treatment-related toxicity in endemic regions.Copyright © 2020 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",Excluded

2115,"Neoadjuvant stereotactic body radiation therapy, capecitabine, and liver transplantation for unresectable hilar cholangiocarcinoma. Hilar cholangiocarcinoma (CCA) is a difficult malignancy to treat surgically because of its anatomical location and its frequent association with primary sclerosing cholangitis. Neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy followed by liver transplantation in lymph node-negative patients has been advanced by select liver transplant centers for the treatment of patients with unresectable disease. This approach has most commonly used external-beam radiotherapy in combination with biliary brachytherapy and 5-fluorouracil-based chemotherapy. Our center recently embarked on a protocol using stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) followed by capecitabine in lymph node-negative patients until liver transplantation. We, therefore, retrospectively determined the tolerability and pathological response in this pilot study. During a 3-year period, 17 patients with unresectable hilar CCA were evaluated for treatment under this protocol. In all, 12 patients qualified for neoadjuvant therapy and were treated with SBRT (50-60 Gy in 3-5 fractions over the course of 2 weeks). After 1 week of rest, capecitabine was initiated at 1330 mg/m2/day, and it was continued until liver transplantation. During neoadjuvant therapy, there were 35 adverse events in all, with cholangitis and palmar-plantar erythrodysesthesia being the most common. Capecitabine dose reductions were required on 5 occasions. Ultimately, 9 patients were listed for transplantation, and 6 patients received a liver transplant. The explant pathology of hilar tumors showed at least a partial treatment response in 5 patients, with extensive tumor necrosis and fibrosis noted. Additionally, high apoptotic indices and low proliferative indices were measured during histological examinations. Eleven transplant-related complications occurred, and the 1-year survival rate after transplantation was 83%. In this pilot study, neoadjuvant therapy with SBRT, capecitabine, and liver transplantation for unresectable CCA demonstrated acceptable tolerability.

532,"Pulmonary nodules: effect of adaptive statistical iterative reconstruction (ASIR) technique on performance of a computer-aided detection (CAD) system-comparison of performance between different-dose CT scans. PURPOSE: To evaluate the effects of ASIR on CAD system of pulmonary nodules using clinical routine-dose CT and lower-dose CT., MATERIALS AND METHODS: Thirty-five patients (body mass index, 22.17 +/- 4.37 kg/m(2)) were scanned by multidetector-row CT with tube currents (clinical routine-dose CT, automatically adjusted mA; lower-dose CT, 10 mA) and X-ray voltage (120 kVp). Each 0.625-mm-thick image was reconstructed at 0%-, 50%-, and 100%-ASIR: 0%-ASIR is reconstructed using only the filtered back-projection algorithm (FBP), while 100%-ASIR is reconstructed using the maximum ASIR and 50%-ASIR implies a blending of 50% FBP and ASIR. CAD output was compared retrospectively with the results of the reference standard which was established using a consensus panel of three radiologists. Data were analyzed using Bonferroni/Dunn's method. Radiation dose was calculated by multiplying dose-length product by conversion coefficient of 0.021., RESULTS: The consensus panel found 265 non-calcified nodules <= 30 mm (ground-glass opacity [GGO], 103; part-solid, 34; and solid, 128). CAD sensitivity was significantly higher at 100%-ASIR [clinical routine-dose CT, 71% (overall), 49% (GGO); lower-dose CT, 52% (overall), 67% (solid)] than at 0%-ASIR [clinical routine-dose CT, 54% (overall), 25% (GGO); lower-dose CT, 36% (overall), 50% (solid)] (p<0.001). Mean number of false-positive findings per examination was significantly higher at 100%-ASIR (clinical routine-dose CT, 8.5; lower-dose CT, 6.2) than at 0%-ASIR (clinical routine-dose CT, 4.6; lower-dose CT, 3.5; p<0.001). Effective doses were 10.77 +/- 3.41 mSv in clinical routine-dose CT and 2.67 +/- 0.17 mSv in lower-dose CT., CONCLUSION: CAD sensitivity at 100%-ASIR on lower-dose CT is almost equal to that at 0%-ASIR on clinical routine-dose CT. ASIR can increase CAD sensitivity despite increased false-positive findings. Copyright © 2011 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.",Excluded

2098,"High-tech facelift. Recent technological advances in our specialty have made us reappraise the way we approach facial rejuvenation. Some of these technological interfaces have made it possible, in the author's experience, to improve results and to tackle difficult aesthetic problems. The purpose of this paper is to report how we combine these technological advances in an effort to improve the aesthetic outcomes. These technological advances are: laser skin resurfacing, endoscopy, newer fat grafting procedures, and new alloplastic materials for bone augmentation. Other technological advances are consultations via the Internet, computer imaging for simulation of possible outcomes, etc. Endoscopy is routinely used in our facial rejuvenative procedures, almost always for the forehead, often for the midface and less often for the neck. Fat grafting procedures using newly adapted concepts are used for the brow, glabella, tear trough deformity, cheeks, lips, chin, nasolabial folds, marionette lines, and other areas of soft tissue depressions apparent before or after the lifting procedures. This has allowed us to restore the tridimensional volume and treat the soft tissue atrophy. Patients with significant skeletal soft tissue disproportion due to aging, loss of dentition, prior trauma or congenital defects may receive one or more of the following implants: glabella, cheek, piriformis, angle of the mandible, mandibular body glove type of implant, prejawl implant, chin overlay or a glove type of implant. Our preference is for a porous polyethylene material because of its tissue ingrowth inductiveness. Individuals who have damaged skin due to solar exposure, aging, smoking, etc., may receive Ultrapulse CO2 laser resurfacing at the same operative setting (more often) or in a delayed fashion. The Versapulse laser is also needed for the treatment of some skin changes secondary to aging such as telangiectasias (Variable Pulse Green) and brown spots (Q-Switch 532). The high-tech facelift has allowed us to treat the severely damaged skin, fat atrophy, bone atrophy in many patients, at the same time that the lifting procedure is performed. This provides a more comprehensive approach to facial rejuvenation. The combination of different techniques and technologies maximizes the effectiveness and minimizes the potential side effects of each one. Scars in the forehead and scalp are avoided. Incision and fat removal in the lower eyelid are often unnecessary. It provides a more precise vertical lifting with correction of the tear trough deformity and gives a tridimensional restoration of the facial volume. The facial disharmony is treated at every level starting from the facial skeletal support to the most external envelope (skin). Over 200 patients have been treated this way with a minimal rate of complications. The high-tech facial rejuvenation has allowed us to improve the surgical results of our patients compared with previous isolated techniques. The combination of each one of the techniques require a precise understanding of the limits and benefits of each. Case examples of the different combinations will be shown.",Excluded
1121,"A comparison between unilateral transverse process-pedicle and bilateral puncture techniques in percutaneous kyphoplasty. Study Design. A prospective comparative study. Objective. To assess the clinical and radiological outcomes for the treatment of osteoporotic vertebral compression fractures using unilateral transverse process-pedicle and bilateral percutaneous kyphoplasty (PKP). Summary of Background Data. PKP is a widely used vertebral augmentation procedure for treating painful vertebral compression fractures. A percutaneous bilateral approach is typically used to access the vertebral body. Many previous studies have reported excellent clinical results with PKP. In contrast, numerous complications and problems have also been reported, such as puncture diffi culty, cement leakage, and adjacent vertebral fracture. Methods. This prospective study included 316 patients with singlelevel lumbar osteoporotic vertebral compression fracture, 224 females and 92 males with a mean age of 71.5 years. Randomized patients underwent PKP using 2 different puncture techniques. The patients were followed up postoperatively and were assessed mainly with regard to clinical and radiological outcomes. Clinical outcomes were evaluated mainly using the visual analogue scale for pain and 36- Item Short Form Health Survey (SF-36) questionnaire for health status. Radiological outcomes were assessed mainly on the basis of radiation dose, bone cement distribution, vertebral body height, and kyphotic angle. Results. Patients were followed up from 12 to 28 months, with an average of 16.8 months. One hundred fi fty-eight patients were treated with unilateral method and 151 patients were treated with bilateral method. In the unilateral group, the volume of the injected cement and radiation dose were signifi cantly less than that in the bilateral group. All patients in both groups had signifi cantly less pain after the procedures, compared with their preoperative period pain. No statistically signifi cant differences were observed when visual analogue scale and 36-Item Short Form Health Survey were compared between the groups. Both unilateral and bilateral groups showed insignifi cant decrease in the kyphotic angle during the follow-ups. The kyphotic angle in the unilateral group improved more signifi cantly than in the bilateral group. In the bilateral group, 16 patients had obvious pain in the puncture sites at 1 month postoperatively caused by facet joint violation. With local block treatment, the pain disappeared in all patients at the last follow-up. Conclusion. Both bilateral and unilateral PKP are relatively safe and provide effective treatment for patients with painful osteoporotic vertebral compression fracture. However, unilateral PKP received less radiation dose and operation time, it also offered a higher degree of deformity correction and resulted in less complication than bilateral PKP.Copyright © 2014 Lippincott Williams & Wilkins.",Excluded
3373,"Nomogram model to predict postoperative relapse after mandibular osteoradionecrosis surgery. Purpose: Osteoradionecrosis of the mandible (ORNM) is one of the most devastating complications following radiotherapy. Postoperative relapse (POR) occurs with high incidence even if a radical resection is performed. The current investigation was designed to identify prognostic factors for POR and to establish a nomogram model to estimate the risk for the onset of POR of ORNM. Material(s) and Method(s): A retrospective study was conducted in ORNM patients during the period from 2003 to 2016. Predictive factors for POR were preliminarily filtered by Kaplan-Meier analysis and were further confirmed by Cox regression model. A nomogram model was established to predict the risk for the onset of POR, and the performance was estimated by receiver operating characteristic (ROC) and calibration curve. POR was defined as the primary outcome variable and was measured using univariate and multivariate analyses. Result(s): A total of 213 patients were analyzed, and the total incidence of POR was 24.4% (52/213). In the Cox regression analysis, radiation doses >=80 Gy (versus80 Gy, OR = 3.528, P0.001, 95% CI: 1.759-7.076), location of ORNM (lesion only in mandibular body versus that involving mandibular body, angulus and ramus versus, OR = 2.900, P = 0.007, 95% CI: 1.345-6.253), S classification (S2 versus S0, OR = 8.926, P = 0.001, 95% CI: 2.487-32.036), and surgical treatment (sequestretomy versus ER + reconstruction, OR = 3.299, P = 0.012, 95% CI: 1.294-8.411) were significantly associated with POR. The current nomogram model can effectively evaluate the hazard risk and survival rate of POR. The discrimination capability was tested by the ROC curve with an area under the curve of 0.813, revealing highly predictive abilities. The calibration curve showed sufficient fitness. Conclusion(s): The current nomogram model was effective in predicting the risk of POR in ORNM patients.Copyright © 2018",Excluded

OBJECTIVES: This study compares cancerogenesis risks posed by the 64 row detector and the 320 row detector computed tomography scanners used during coronary computed tomography angiography (CCTA) following decennial screening guidelines., MATERIAL AND METHODS: Data of the radiation absorbed after CCTA by lung, thyroid, and female breast in patients between 50 and 70 years of age obtained from prior published literature for the 64 row CT scanner were compared with data from our study using 320 row detector CT scanner. Data from the 64 row and the 320 row detector CT scanners was used to determine lifetime attributable risks (LAR) of cancer based on the biological effects of ionizing radiation (BEIR) VII report., RESULTS: The relative reduction of LAR (%) for 50-, 60-, and 70-year-old patients undergoing scanning with the 320 row detector CT scanner was 30% lower for lung, and more than 50% lower for female breast when compared with results from 64 row detector CT scanner. The use of 320 row detector CT would result in a combined cumulative cancer incidence of less than 1/500 for breast in women and less than 1/1000 for lung in men; By comparison, this is much lower than other more common risk factors: 16-fold for lung cancer in persistent smokers, 2-fold for breast cancer with a first degree family member history of breast cancer, and 10-fold for thyroid cancer with a family member with thyroid cancer. Decennial screening would benefit at least 355,000 patients from sudden cardiac death each year, 94% of whom have significant coronary artery disease, with at least one stenosis >75%. LAR for thyroid cancer was negligible for both scanners., CONCLUSION: Lung and female breast LAR reductions with 320 row detector compared with 64 row detector CT are substantial, and the benefits would outweigh increased cancer risks with decennial screening in the age group of 50-70 years.",Excluded

The scattering light intensity of the surface and internal matrix of the optic was measured using Scheimpflug photography. Visual acuity (VA) was measured using VA charts, and contrast VA and that with glare (glare VA) were examined using a contrast sensitivity tester. Ocular higher-order aberrations (HOAs) were measured using a Hartmann-Shack aberrometer., RESULTS: Mean scattering light intensity of the surface and internal matrix of the optic was significantly higher in the acrylic group than in the silicone and PMMA groups (P < .0001). Mean uncorrected VA, photopic and mesopic contrast VA and glare VA, and HOAs did not differ significantly among groups, although mean corrected VA in the acrylic group was significantly better than that in the other groups (P = .0023). Scattering light intensity of the surface and internal matrix did not correlate with VA, contrast VA, or glare VA, and did not correlate with ocular and internal optic HOAs in the acrylic group., CONCLUSIONS: At more than 10 years postoperatively, visual function, including contrast sensitivity, and ocular HOAs were comparable among eyes that received acrylic, silicone, and PMMA IOLs. Surface scattering and glistenings with the acrylic IOLs were not significantly correlated with visual function and optical aberrations. Copyright © 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.",Excluded
2249,"Relationships between nasopharyngeal carcinoma and radioactive elements in soils in China. Earlier comparisons of epidemiological and geochemical maps of China disclosed associations between high mortality rates from nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) and low contents of magnesium in the soil. More recent work has shown that high rates of NPC are also associated with high levels of uranium and thorium in the soil. These latest findings are consistent with the earlier ones, since uranium and thorium occur predominantly in acid rocks poor in magnesium. Uranium and thorium are radioactive, and their progeny include radioactive elements such as radium and radon. Whether or not naturally occurring radioactive elements could be risk factors in NPC should, therefore, be further investigated. Direct carcinogenic properties of radon are well known, but in connection with NPC possibilities for reactivation of virus by natural ionizing radiation should also be considered.

1266,"Anaplastic thyroid carcinoma: comparison of conventional radiotherapy and hyperfractionation chemoradiotherapy in two groups. Anaplastic thyroid carcinoma (ATC) is a highly aggressive neoplasm with a poor prognosis. Curative management of these tumors has been difficult secondary to delayed diagnosis and advanced disease at presentation. Treatment modalities including surgery and fractionated radiotherapy have had limited success in controlling these tumors. Median survival time is often measured in months. A review of all patients treated between 1952 and 1999 identified 32 patients with anaplastic or poorly differentiated thyroid carcinoma. Patients were divided into two groups: those treated between 1952 to 1980 (9 patients, group 1) and those treated between 1981 and 1999 (23 patients, group 2). Most group 1 patients received once-daily radiotherapy and most group 2 patients received twice-daily radiotherapy with concurrent chemotherapy. A variety of radiotherapy techniques were used. Chemotherapy consisted of doxorubicin, paclitaxel, vincristine, or cisplatin. Eleven patients presented with lymph node metastasis and two patients had distant metastases at diagnosis. The most common clinical presentation was a neck mass in 17 patients. In group 1, one patient was treated with surgery only, four with surgery and radiotherapy and four with radiotherapy alone. In group 2, 1 patient was treated with surgery only; 3 with surgery and radiotherapy; 10 with radiotherapy and chemotherapy; 5 with surgery, radiotherapy, and chemotherapy; and 5 with radiotherapy alone. Overall 2-year survival rates were 44% for group 1 and 52% for group 2. Two-year progression-free survival (PFS) was 53% for group 1 and 38% for group 2. Five (16%) patients died within 60 days of diagnosis. Severe side effects included skin sequelae (one patient) and osteoradionecrosis of the mandible (one patient). There were 10 (52%) long-term survivors (>2 years). Clinicopathologic features associated with extended survival were limited extent of disease and inclusion in group 2. Among patients with ATC surgery, hyperfractionated radiotherapy in conjunction with chemotherapy is associated with better survival but not PFS compared to conventional radiotherapy.",Excluded
1048,"Renal Safety of Repeated Intravascular Administrations of Iodinated or Gadolinium-Based Contrast Media within a Short Interval. OBJECTIVE: We aimed to investigate whether repeated intravascular administration of iodinated contrast media (ICM) or gadolinium-based contrast agents (GBCAs) within a short interval was associated with an increased risk of post-contrast acute kidney injury (PC-AKI). MATERIALS AND METHODS: This retrospective study included 300 patients (mean age +/- standard deviation, 68.5 +/- 8.1 years; 131 male and 169 female) who had undergone at least one ICM-enhanced perfusion brain CT scan, had their baseline and follow-up serum creatinine levels available, and had not undergone additional contrast-enhanced examinations 72 hours before and after a time window of interest were included. The study population was divided into three groups: single-dose group and groups of patients who had received multiple contrast administrations in the time window of interest with the minimum contrast repeat interval either within 4 hours (0-4-hour group) or between 4 to 48 hours (4-48-hour group). Multivariable logistic regression analysis was conducted to evaluate the association between AKI and repeated ICM administrations. A similar supplementary analysis was performed including both ICM and GBCA. RESULT(S): When ICM was only considered ignoring GBCA, among 300 patients, 207 patients received a single dose of ICM, 58 had repeated doses within 4 hours (0-4-hour group), and 35 patients had repeated doses between 4 to 48 hours (4-48-hour group). Most patients (> 95%) had a baseline estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) of >= 30 mL/min/1.73 m2. AKI occurred in 7.2%, 13.8%, and 8.6% of patients in the single-dose, 0-4-hour, and 4-48-hour groups, respectively. In the 0-4-hour and 4-48-hour groups, additional exposure to ICM was not associated with AKI after adjusting for comorbidities and nephrotoxic drugs (all p values > 0.05). CONCLUSION(S): Repeated intravascular administrations of ICM within a short interval did not increase the risk of AKI in our study patients suspected of acute stroke with a baseline eGFR of >= 30 mL/min/1.73 m2.Copyright © 2021 The Korean Society of Radiology.",Excluded
313,"A retrospective multicenter study of carbon-ion radiotherapy for major salivary gland carcinomas: Subanalysis of J-CROS 1402 HN. A retrospective multicenter study was carried out to assess the clinical outcomes of carbon-ion radiotherapy for head and neck malignancies (Japan Carbon-Ion Radiation Oncology Study Group [J-CROS] study: 1402 HN). We evaluated the safety and efficacy of carbon-ion radiotherapy in patients with major salivary gland carcinoma. Sixty-nine patients treated with carbon-ion radiotherapy at four Japanese institutions were analyzed. Thirty-three patients (48%) had adenoid cystic carcinomas, 10 (14%) had mucoepidermoid carcinomas, and 26 (38%) had other disease types. Three patients (4%) had T1 disease, 8 (12%) had T2, 25 (36%) had T3, and 33 (48%) had T4. The median radiation dose was 64 Gy (relative biological effectiveness) in 16 fractions. The median gross tumor volume was 27 mL. The median follow-up period was 32.7 months. The 3-year local control rate and overall survival rate were 81% and 94%, respectively. Regarding acute toxicities, seven patients had grade 3 mucositis and seven had grade 3 dermatitis. Regarding late toxicities, one patient had grade 3 dysphagia and one had a grade 3 brain abscess. No grade 4 or worse late reactions were observed. In conclusion, definitive carbon-ion radiotherapy was effective with acceptable toxicity for major salivary gland carcinomas.Copyright © 2018 The Authors.

695,"Impact of sarcopenia on survival of pancreatic cancer patients treated with concurrent chemoradiotherapy. Purpose: To investigate the prognostic impact of sarcopenia on the survival of patients with locally advanced pancreatic cancer (LAPC) treated with concurrent chemoradiotherapy (CCRT). Method(s): We retrospectively reviewed 299 patients diagnosed with LAPC and treated with definitive CCRT from 2000 to 2015. Skeletal muscle index (SMI) was measured using computed tomography scans and sarcopenia was defined as SMI <29.6 cm2/m2 for women and <36.2 cm2/m2 for men. The significance of sarcopenia for progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) was evaluated. Result(s): Sarcopenia was present in 29 patients (9.7%). In multivariate analysis, sarcopenia was a significant factor for PFS (p = 0.043). Although sarcopenia was not a significant factor for OS (p = 0.121) in multivariate analysis, long-term survivors were observed only in the no sarcopenia group (OS at 60 months: 9.5% vs 0%, p < 0.001). Conclusion(s): In patients undergoing CCRT for LAPC, sarcopenia is an independent factor for adverse prognosis.Copyright © Fondazione IRCCS Istituto Nazionale dei Tumori 2020.",Excluded

Objectives: This study aims to assess rheumatologists' perceptions, utilization patterns, and attitudes towards the modified New York (mNY) criteria for ankylosing spondylitis (AS) and Assessment of SpondyloArthritis International Society (ASAS) criteria for axial spondyloarthritis (axSpA). Method(s): Members of the national rheumatology societies in five countries (United States of America (USA), Canada, India, Turkey, and Brazil) were invited to participate in a survey containing questions regarding rheumatologists' familiarity, and use of AS and axSpA classification criteria in daily practice, perceived specificity of spondyloarthritis features in making the diagnosis, patterns of imaging tests performed in daily practice, and their opinion about the need for modification of current classification criteria. The responses were analyzed by gender, age, years in practice, as well as by country of practice. Descriptive statistics, t test, and chi-square test were used for comparison of groups. Result(s): Approximately 6% rheumatologists (478 out of 8021 professional association members) from five countries completed the survey. The country-specific response rates were Brazil 4%, USA 4.3%, India 11%, Canada 14%, and Turkey 29%, though the overall contributions from individual countries were USA 47%, India 14.9%, Brazil 13.8%, Turkey 12.8%, and Canada 8.8%. The mean age of respondents was 50 years (+/- 11.8), 31% were females and 90% spent majority (> 75%) of their time in clinical practice. The mNY and ASAS criteria were regularly used in clinical practice by 44 and 66% of responders, respectively. Those reporting ""always"" using ASAS criteria were more likely to be women (p = 0.006), and within 5 years of completing rheumatology training. Vast majority (74%) regarded Inflammatory Back Pain (IBP) as a specific feature for axSpA. Majority (50 and 60%, respectively) regarded uveitis and dactylitis as ""very specific"" features helping them make the diagnosis of axSpA, whereas heel enthesitis, peripheral inflammatory arthritis, and response to NSAIDs were considered ""somewhat specific"" by 50% of the responders. Less than half (47%) of the responders used the mNY grading for X-ray of SI joints. In the case of normal X-ray of SI joint, the use of MRI was more frequent than CT scan (83.6 vs. 10.9%) in assessing for sacroiliitis. If sacroiliitis was not seen on X-rays, the likelihood of ordering MRI was significantly higher among rheumatologists completing training within < 15 years versus > 25 years prior (90 vs. 75%, p = 0.007). Overall, 70% thought that ASAS criteria were adequately specific for clinical trials. However, 42% respondents still felt a need to modify ASAS classification criteria for axSpA. Also, 46% respondents felt that mNY criteria should be modified. Conclusion(s): In the absence of diagnostic criteria, majority of rheumatologists are using the classification criteria for diagnosis of axSpA. Though axSpA classification criteria are perceived to be specific for clinical trials, 40% rheumatologists feel the need to modify these criteria.Key Points* This study informs how rheumatologists in five countries spread over four different continents diagnose axSpA in clinical practice.* Since majority rheumatologists among survey respondents across the countries use ASAS criteria for diagnosis of axSpA, more specific criteria may be required to avoid overdiagnosis.* MRI is commonly used to rule out sacroiliitis in case of normal X-ray of sacroiliac joints.Copyright © 2020, International League of Associations for Rheumatology (ILAR).",Excluded
3478,"Survival curves after X-ray and heat treatments for melanoma cells derived directly from surgical specimens of tumours in man. X-ray and heat survival curves were established for melanoma cells derived directly from surgical specimens of tumours in man by using the Courtenay soft agar colony assay. The plating efficiency for 11 of the 14 melanomas studied was sufficiently high (PE = 0.3-58%) to measure cell survival over at least two decades. Experiments repeated with cells stored in liquid nitrogen showed that the survival assay gave highly reproducible results. The melanomas exhibited individual and characteristic survival curves whether exposed to radiation or heat (43.5 degrees C). The Do-values were in the ranges 0.63-1.66 Gy (X-rays) and 33-58 min (heat). The survival curves were similar to those reported previously for human melanoma xenografts. The radiation sensitivity of the cells was not correlated to the heat sensitivity. Since the melanomas appeared to be very heterogeneous in radiation response in vitro as melanomas are known to be clinically, it is suggested that melanomas may be suitable for prospective studies aimed at establishing whether clinical radioresponsiveness somehow is related to in vitro survival curve parameters.",Excluded
584,"Use of handheld X-ray fluorescence as a non-invasive method to distinguish between Asian and African elephant tusks. We describe the use of handheld X-ray fluorescence, for elephant tusk species identification. Asian (n = 72) and African (n = 85) elephant tusks were scanned and we utilized the species differences in elemental composition to develop a functional model differentiating between species with high precision. Spatially, the majority of measured elements (n = 26) exhibited a homogeneous distribution in cross-section, but a more heterologous pattern in the longitudinal direction. Twenty-one of twenty four elements differed between Asian and African samples. Data were subjected to hierarchical cluster analysis followed by a stepwise discriminant analysis, which identified elements for the functional equation. The best equation consisted of ratios of Si, S, Cl, Ti, Mn, Ag, Sb and W, with Zr as the denominator. Next, Bayesian binary regression model analysis was conducted to predict the probability that a tusk would be of African origin. A cut-off value was established to improve discrimination. This Bayesian hybrid classification model was then validated by scanning an additional 30 Asian and 41 African tusks, which showed high accuracy (94%) and precision (95%) rates. We conclude that handheld XRF is an accurate, non-invasive method to discriminate origin of elephant tusks provides rapid results applicable to use in the field.",Excluded
2268,"Have increases in solar ultraviolet exposure contributed to the rise in incidence of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma?. The incidence of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) has increased substantially in many countries over recent decades. The aetiology of this cancer is poorly understood, and this rise is largely unexplained. The incidence of NHL is known to increase markedly following immune suppression. In the light of evidence that exposure to ultraviolet radiation (UVR) may cause systemic immune suppression, part of the recent increase in NHL incidence may reflect population-based increases in UVR exposure. That such exposure increases have occurred is inferred from the widespread increases in skin cancer incidence in fair-skinned populations, especially malignant melanoma (MM), over recent decades. Epidemiological evidence presented here in support of the proposed UVR-NHL relationship includes the following: in Caucasian populations there is a moderate positive correlation between ambient UVR level, by latitude, and NHL incidence; there is also a positive correlation between time trends in MM incidence and NHL; there is some evidence that migration across latitude gradients induces concordant shifts in risks of NHL and MM. Data from two historical cancer patient registers show that, in individuals, these two cancers concurred a little more often than expected. These findings support recent suggestions that UVR-induced impairment of immune functioning contributes to the aetiology of NHL.",Excluded
1245,"Functional changes cardiovascular: normobaric activity and microgravity in young healthy human subjects. BACKGROUND: The cardiovascular system works to maintain homeostasis through a series of adaptive responses to physiological requirements. Different self-regulatory mechanism prevent the effects induced by hydrostatic pressure changes on oncotic pressure caused by postural changes. Gravity exerts a strong influence on the postural changes with implications on the cardiovascular system. In orbit, gravity (+Gz) is responsible of mass redistribution of circulating blood flow. The aim of this study was the evaluation of the adaptive responses of cardiovascular system to postural changes with and without the use of the Lower Body Negative Pressure (LBNP). We considered that pressure changes that occur in human body in orbit can be simulated experimentally with use of Tilt-Test (Clino/ortho; Clino/head-down; head-down/ortho). This investigation could be useful for studying the influence on astronauts of long flights., SUBJECTS AND METHODS: We studied in 12 months, 30 young healthy volunteers (20 males, 10 female) during postural change tests. In the first evaluation they were submitted to tilt-test for 40 minutes, remaining in head-up +60 degrees (this state corresponds to a kind of gravitational stress +Gz) and in head-down to -30 degrees (-Gz) for 20 minutes. During the second assessment (after 5 +/- 1 days) all volunteers wear a device that simulate a state of LBNP at -20 mmHg. Afterwards, they were processed to 20 minutes in Head Down -8 degrees and after 2 hours of rest to 20 minutes at -15 degrees. Volunteers were monitored measuring blood pressure, heart rate and by Transthoracic Echocardiogram (TTE)., RESULTS: Collected data were elaborated by a statistical analysis. We observed during orthostatic position for 40 min (+60 degrees) without LBNP, lower diameters and volumes of left and right ventricular (p < 0.05) and an increase in heart rate in comparison with the baseline conditions in clinostatism. Despite the reduction of preload volume, the mean value of cardiac output does not vary significantly. In Trendelemburg (-15 degrees) data show a non-significant variation (p > 0.05) of left and right ventricular diameters and volumes, while cardiac output and systolic blood pressure varies significantly (p < 0.05) compared to clinostatic and orthostatic position. With LBNP in head down to -8 degrees and -15 degrees, systolic and diastolic arterial pressure, ventricular volumes and cardiac output were unchanged if compared to values obtained in clinostatism with and without LBNP. If compared to -30 degrees in Trendelemburg without LBNP, data reached statistical significance (p < 0.05)., CONCLUSIONS: The cardiovascular system and the autonomic nervous system, respond to postural changes and to volemia alterations, maintaining the physiological cardiac output, in order to preserve the metabolic requirements of body.",Excluded
696,"Hapten-specific IgE antibody responses in mice. VI. Selective enhancement of IgE antibody production by low doses of X-irradiation and by cyclophosphamide. Exposure of BALB/c, A/J, and (BALB/c X A/J)F1 mice, which are IgE high responder animals, to total body x-irradiation ranging from 50 to 200 R resulted in a dose-dependent enhancement of the hapten-specific IgE antibody level as compared to unirradiated control mice. In contrast, anti-hapten antibody responses of the IgG class in these same animals were rarely enhanced, and when so, were of a lesser degree. This relatively selective augmentation of the IgE vs IgG antibody responses was observed in both unprimed and primed mice. By utilizing adoptive transfer systems, it was demonstrated that the enhancing effects of x-irradiation resulted from its action on the carrier-primed cell population and not upon the responding B cells or upon macrophages. The data presented herein suggest that this enhancement phenomenon is the result of the elimination of T cells (or their products) with suppressive functions and that these cells are neither dependent upon nor specific for the carrier antigen employed in the immunization. This hypothesis is given indirect support by the observations that treatment of the same strains of mice with cyclophosphamide, in doses known to abrogate suppressive T cell functions, resulted in a similar enhancing effect to that observed after low doses of x-irradiation. In addition an interesting difference between IgE and IgG precursor B lymphocytes was observed by the ability of IgE B cells to differentiate to the secretory state at a strikingly more rapid rate than IgG B lymphocytes when exposed to comparable T cell helper influences. These observations may provide important clues to the cellular mechanisms of the immune regulation of the IgE response and its relationship to allergic diseases.",Excluded

AIMS: Stereotactic ablative body radiotherapy (SABR) is a non-invasive treatment option for inoperable patients or patients with irresectable liver tumors. Outcome and toxicity were evaluated retrospectively in this single-institution patient cohort., PATIENTS AND METHODS: Between 2010 and 2014, 39 lesions were irradiated in 33 consecutive patients (18 male, 15 female, median age of 68 years). All the lesions were liver metastases (n = 34) or primary hepatocellular carcinomas (n = 5). The patients had undergone four-dimensional respiration-correlated PET-CT for treatment simulation to capture tumor motion. We analyzed local control with a focus on CT-based response at three months, one year and two years after treatment, looking at overall survival and the progression pattern., RESULTS: All patients were treated with hypofractionated image-guided stereotactic radiotherapy. The equivalent dose in 2 Gy fractions varied from 62.5 Gy to 150 Gy, delivered in 3-10 fractions (median dose 93.8 Gy, alpha/beta = 10). The CT-based regression pattern three months after radiotherapy revealed partial regression in 72.7% of patients with a complete remission in 27.3% of the cases. The site of first progression was predominantly distant. One- and two-year overall survival rates were 85.4% and 68.8%, respectively. No toxicity of grade 2 or higher according to the NCI Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events v4.0 was observed., CONCLUSION: SABR is a safe and efficient treatment for selected inoperable patients or irresectable tumors of the liver. Future studies should combine SABR with systemic treatment acting in synergy with radiation, such as immunological interventions or hypoxic cell radiosensitizers to prevent distant relapse.

389,"Shifts in broadband power and alpha peak frequency observed during long-term isolation. Prolonged periods of social isolation and spatial confinement do not only represent an issue that needs to be faced by a few astronauts during space missions, but can affect all of us as recently shown during pandemic situations. The fundamental question, how the brain adapts to periods of sensory deprivation and re-adapts to normality, has only received little attention. Here, we use eyes closed and eyes open resting-state electroencephalographic (EEG) recordings to investigate how neural activity is altered during 120 days of isolation in a spatially confined, space-analogue environment. After disentangling oscillatory patterns from 1/f activity, we show that isolation leads to a reduction in broadband power and a flattening of the 1/f spectral slope. Beyond that, we observed a reduction in alpha peak frequency during isolation, but did not find strong evidence for isolation-induced changes that are of oscillatory nature. Critically, all effects reversed upon release from isolation. These findings suggest that isolation and concomitant sensory deprivation lead to an enhanced cortical deactivation which might be explained by a reduction in the mean neuronal population firing rate.",Excluded

Introduction and Objectives: Since 2006 patients from Gothenburg with metastatic kidney cancer have been treated with targeted therapy at the outpatient clinic of the Urologic department, Sahlgrenska University Hospital. Therapy was started by a senior urologist and thereafter administrated by two specialized nurses conducting frequent visits for handing out medicine, blood checks, weight and blood pressure controls, patient education and tending of side effects. The responsible doctor was contacted when adjustment of the treatment was needed. All medicine was handed to the patients to ensure that a minimum of the drugs were wasted. Visits to the doctors were conducted every 4th to 6th month mostly at the time of X-ray or when needed. The objective of the study was to report our experience with targeted therapy at a urologic outpatient clinic performed as partly nurse administered. Material(s) and Method(s): Between 2006 and 2012, 82 patients in total were treated with targeted therapy and registered in a database. All treatment and survival data were recorded. There were 56 men and 26 women. Result(s): Eighty-two patients were treated in first line. Treatment time on targeted therapy ranged from 9 days to 3 years and 10 months (median 11.5 months). In the first line 58 (71%) of the patients had sunitinib, 13 (16%) sorafenib, 7 (8%) bevacizumab+interferon, 3 (4%) pazopanib and 1 (1%) had temsirolimus. Thirty-four treatments were started in the second line. Ten treatments were given in the third and 2 in the fourth line. In 2012 33 patients were treated. During that year 213 visits were conducted by the specialized nurses and 54 visits by a senior urologist. Conclusion(s): A partly nurse administrated outpatient treatment with targeted therapy is possible when performed in close contact with the responsible doctor. It makes it possible to follow up the patients with short intervals and provides a close contact which they can always turn to with the numerous problems these patients have without consuming too much of doctor time.",Excluded

The examination was carried out with the horse in the standing position or under general anaesthesia. Angiocardiograms were performed on 10 normal horses and satisfactory pictures of the right and left ventricles, pulmonary arteries, aorta and coronary circulation were obtained. The technique was also used in a foal with severe congenital heart disease. The most practical methods of recording the images in the standing position were cinefilm or video taperecording. In the recumbent position both cinefilm and radiographs were taken. No damage to the heart was inflicted by the catheters and only a few ventricular premature contractions (less than five) were produced by the pressure of injection. No signs of toxicity were recorded using repeated injections of contrast material (ie, less than 600 ml).",Excluded
1273,"Calcium pyrophosphate crystal deposition in a cohort of 52 patients with Gitelman Syndrome. Background: Gitelman syndrome (GS) is a rare recessively inherited tubulop-athy, caused by inactive mutations in SLC12A3 gene encoding the thiazide-sensi-tive-sodium-chloride transporter. It is characterized by an hypokalemic metabolic alkalosis with hypomagnesemia and hypocalciuria. Calcium pyrophosphate (CPP) crystal deposition is frequently described in GS case-reports but its prevalence and clinical phenotype are unknown. Objective(s): The aim is to describe clinical, biological and radiological features of CPP in a cohort of patients with genetically proven GS. Method(s): All patients (pts) with genetically proven GS in the French national reference center of rare diseases were proposed to have a consultation with a senior rheumatologist. Demographic data, history of joint pain and flare and biology disorders were recorded. Other causes of CPP disease were systematically ruled out. CPP crystal deposition was assessed by X-rays (all peripheral joints and cervical spine) and ultrasonography (US) (wrist, knee, ankle joints and symptomatic joints). Patients with history of cervical pain underwent computed tomography (CT) of the full cervical spine from occipital bone to C1-T1 disk, including temporomandibular joints. Result(s): Fifty-two GS pts (21 men, mean age 46.5+/- 12.2 years) have been examined by a rheumatologist. Almost all patients had an heterozygous mutation on SLC12A3 gene. Forty-four pts experienced joint pain (84.6%), 23 joint flares (44,2%) and 25 cervical pain (48.1%). X-rays were performed in 42 pts, US in 38 and CT in 23. CPP depositions were observed in 36 (85.7%), 27 (71.1%) and 15 pts (65.2%) by X-rays, US and CT, respectively. All techniques combined, chondrocalcinosis was discovered in 42 patients. Deposits occurred in knees (n=32), wrists (n=29), cervical spine (n=23), ankles and feet (n=22) and shoulders (n=16). CPP depositions were widespread involving at least 3 joints in 27 (55.1%) pts. In knees, CPP depositions involved menisci (n=24), hyaline cartilages (n=16) and ligament or joint capsule (n=15). Cervical spine CT demonstrated CPP deposition in vertebral discs (n=17), transverse ligament (n=13), other ligament (n=13), vertebral facets (n=3) and temporo-mandibular joints (n=5). Patients with CPP crystal deposition in more than 3 joints were significantly older (52.8+/-10.5 years) than patients with 2 or 3 affected joints (40.8+/-11.6 years, p=0.02) or patients without any affected joint (36.6+/-8.1 years, p=0.001). They were also more symptomatic with significantly more joint flares (p<0.0001). Mag-nesemia was inversely correlated with the number of affected joints: patients with >3 or 2-3 affected joints had a significantly lower magnesemia (0.57+/-0.1 and 0.59 +/-0.1 mM, respectively) than patients with only 1 affected joint (0.83+/-0.1 mM). CPP crystal deposition was not associated with potassium level. (Table Presented).",Excluded
2536,"Lung tumour induction in mice after uniform and non-uniform external thoracic X-irradiation. The aim of this study was to investigate the validity of the ICRP procedure of using average tissue/organ dose in estimating carcinogenic risk. It has been suggested that highly non-uniform exposure ('hot spots') is much more carcinogenic than an equivalent dose delivered uniformly. In a series of experiments, mice were irradiated with X-rays either uniformly to the thorax or non-uniformly with 72 1-mm microbeams which irradiated approximately 20 per cent of the total lung volume. Two experiments involving uniform irradiation showed a peaked tumour incidence curve with a maximum at 5 Gy. The first 'microbeam' study also produced a pronounced peak in the dose response with a maximum tumour incidence at 1 Gy average lung dose or 5 Gy to the irradiated lung tissue. This implied the use of average tissue dose might underestimate the carcinogenic hazard of non-uniform exposure. Later, more extensive, microbeam experiments failed to replicate this finding. The results were nearly similar to those for uniform irradiation, with a slight increase in tumour incidence from 2.5-5.0 Gy average lung dose. These results imply that for these irradiation conditions the ICRP dose averaging procedure remains valid.",Excluded

For the other members of the operating team the X-ray load is significantly lower and, therefore, there are no limits in practice. It must be noted that an exact record of the fluoroscoping time and dose measurements is absolutely necessary.",Excluded
173,"670 nm light mitigates oxygen-induced degeneration in C57BL/6J mouse retina. BACKGROUND: Irradiation with light wavelengths from the far red (FR) to the near infrared (NIR) spectrum (600 nm -1000 nm) has been shown to have beneficial effects in several disease models. In this study, we aim to examine whether 670 nm red light pretreatment can provide protection against hyperoxia-induced damage in the C57BL/6J mouse retina. Adult mice (90-110 days) were pretreated with 9 J/cm2 of 670 nm light once daily for 5 consecutive days prior to being placed in hyperoxic environment (75% oxygen). Control groups were exposed to hyperoxia, but received no 670 nm light pretreatment. Retinas were collected after 0, 3, 7, 10 or 14 days of hyperoxia exposure (n = 12/group) and prepared either for histological analysis, or RNA extraction and quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR). Photoreceptor damage and loss were quantified by counting photoreceptors undergoing cell death and measuring photoreceptor layer thickness. Localization of acrolein, and cytochrome c oxidase subunit Va (Cox Va) were identified through immunohistochemistry. Expression of heme oxygenase-1 (Hmox-1), complement component 3 (C3) and fibroblast growth factor 2 (Fgf-2) genes were quantified using qPCR., RESULTS: The hyperoxia-induced photoreceptor loss was accompanied by reduction of metabolic marker, Cox Va, and increased expression of oxidative stress indicator, acrolein and Hmox-1. Pretreatment with 670 nm red light reduced expression of markers of oxidative stress and C3, and slowed, but did not prevent, photoreceptor loss over the time course of hyperoxia exposure., CONCLUSION: The damaging effects of hyperoxia on photoreceptors were ameliorated following pretreatment with 670 nm light in hyperoxic mouse retinas. These results suggest that pretreatment with 670 nm light may provide stability to photoreceptors in conditions of oxidative stress.",Excluded
3510,"Targeted use of endoscopic CO2 laser cricopharyngeal myotomy for improving swallowing function following head and neck cancer treatment. BACKGROUND: Cricopharyngeal dysfunction following head and neck cancer treatment may lead to a significant reduction in oral intake. Carbon dioxide laser is an established procedure for the treatment of non-malignant cricopharyngeal disorders. We report our experience of laser cricopharyngeal myotomy with objective swallowing outcome measures, before and after treatment., METHODS: We identified 11 patients who had undergone carbon dioxide laser cricopharyngeal myotomy for dysphagia following radiotherapy, with or without chemotheraphy between January 2006 and July 2011. We analysed the swallowing outcomes following carbon dioxide laser cricopharyngeal myotomy by retrospective grading of pre- and post-procedure videofluoroscopic swallowing study of liquids, using the validated Modified Barium Swallow Impairment Profile., RESULTS: The median Modified Barium Swallow Impairment Profile score was 13 pre-myotomy and 10 post-myotomy. This difference between scores was non-significant (p = 0.41). The median, cricopharyngeal-specific Modified Barium Swallow Impairment Profile variables (14 and 17) improved from 3 to 2, but were similarly non-significant (p = 0.16). We observed the improved Modified Barium Swallow Impairment Profile scores post-procedure in the majority of patients., CONCLUSION: Endoscopic carbon dioxide laser cricopharyngeal myotomy remains a viable option in treatment-related cricopharyngeal dysfunction; its targeted role requires further prospective study. Objective analysis of the technique can be reported using the validated Modified Barium Swallow Impairment Profile.",Excluded
2406,"Results of hypofractionated whole brain radiotherapy (2x8 Gy) for patients with brain metastases from lung cancer. Purpose: To evaluate the clinical and radiologic response rates, toxicity and tolerability of 2x8 Gy whole brain radiotherapy (WBRT) in lung cancer patients with brain metastases (BM). Method(s): WBRT was delivered to 126 lung cancer patients with BM during 2002-2006. External beam RT was delivered with a fraction dose of 8 Gy on the same day of each consecutive week. Tumor and symptom response and toxicity were recorded at every follow-up. Recursive partitioning analysis (RPA) and the new Graded Prognostic Assessment (GPA) were used for analysis of overall survival (OS). Result(s): Twenty-three patients had small cell (SCLC) and 103 had non small cell lung cancer. Pretreatment median Karnofsky performance score (KPS) was 70 (range 20-90). Clinical response rates were as follows: complete 31%; good partial 30.2%; partial 21.4%; stable 7.9%; and progressive 5.6%. Median palliation and survival duration was 57 and 80 days, respectively. Two- and 6-month survival rates (SR) were 59.5% and 25.4%, respectively. According to recursive partitioning analysis (RPA) 6-month SR for groups 1, 2 and 3 were 61.5, 41.6 and 33.9%, respectively (p=0.002). Six-month SR for the new Graded Prognostic Assessment (GPA) were: GPA 0-1, 7%; GPA 1.5-2.5, 34.2%; GPA 3, 25%; and GPA 3.5-4.0, 66.6% (p=0.0003). Conclusion(s): 2x8 Gy WBRT was found to be feasible. However, the late morbidity of this schedule is unknown so its use could be restricted to patients with poor performance status, with a short life expectancy and/or social problems, unlikely to tolerate more protracted radiotherapy regimens. © 2011 Zerbinis Medical Publications.",Excluded
2956,"Potential welfare impacts of kill-trapping European moles (Talpa europaea) using scissor traps and Duffus traps: A Post mortem examination study. Moles are widely trapped as pests on farms and amenity land in Britain. Spring traps for killing mammals generally require welfare approval in the UK, but mole traps are exempt. Previous research demonstrated wide variation in the mechanical performance of mole traps. In this context, we aimed to produce new data on the welfare impact of kill-trapping moles in the field. We collected 50 moles trapped in southern England (November 2008-August 2009). Captures peaked during the peak in male breeding activity, when captures were almost exclusively male. Post mortem and x-ray (radiation) examinations were conducted to determine injuries and likely cause of death. No moles sustained damaged skulls or upper cervical vertebrae (which could cause unconsciousness immediately). The primary identifiable cause of death for all but one mole was acute haemorrhage; this contrasts with the findings of the only previous such study, in which only one mole showed clear evidence of haemorrhaging. Some moles may have asphyxiated although it was not possible to determine this. Moles most likely became unconscious before death, but times to unconsciousness, and death, can be determined only through killing trials and further investigation is urgently needed. This should be done through the spring traps approval process; this could improve the welfare standards of trapping for many thousands of moles each year. Mole trapping for long-term population control might be better targeted after the peak in male breeding activity, when females are more likely to be caught, but this would threaten the welfare of dependent young underground.Copyright © 2015 Universities Federation for Animal Welfare.",Excluded
3001,"A randomized trial comparing levothyroxine with radioactive iodine in the treatment of sporadic nontoxic goiter. A randomized clinical trial was performed in consecutive patients with sporadic nontoxic nodular goiter to compare efficacy and side effects of iodine-131 (131I) therapy with suppressive levothyroxine (L-thyroxine) treatment. Sixty-four patients were randomized after stratification for sex and menopausal age to receive 131I (4.44 MBq/g thyroid; group A) or suppressive L-thyroxine treatment aiming at TSH values between 0.01 and 0.1 mU/L (group B). The main outcome measurements after 2 yr were goiter size by ultrasound, serum thyroid function tests, markers of bone turnover, and bone mineral density (BMD). Fifty-seven patients completed the trial. Goiter size was reduced after 2 yr by 44% in group A and by 1% in group B (P < 0.001). Nonresponders (goiter reduction < 13%)were 1 of 29 patients in group A and 16 of 28 patients in group B (P = 0.00001). In responders, goiter reduction in group A (46%) was greater than in group B (22%; P < 0.005). In group A, 45% of patients developed hypothyroidism. In group B, 10 patients experienced thyrotoxic symptoms, requiring discontinuation of treatment in 2 (in 1 because of atrial fibrillation). Markers of bone formation and bone resorption increased significantly in group B, related to a mean decrease of 3.6% of BMD at the lumbar spine after 2 yr (from 1.09 +/- 0.22 to 1.05 +/- 0.23 g/cm2; P < 0.001), both in pre- and postmenopausal women. No changes in BMD were observed in group A. In conclusion, 131I therapy is more effective and better tolerated than L-thyroxine treatment in patients with sporadic nontoxic goiter.

Background: The purpose of the present study was to analyze the outcome of chemoradiotherapy for extrahepatic bile duct (EHBD) cancer patients with gross residual disease after surgical resection. Patients and Methods: We retrospectively analyzed 30 patients with EHBD adenocarcinoma who underwent chemoradiotherapy after palliative resection (R2 resection). Postoperative radiotherapy was delivered to the tumor bed including residual tumor and regional lymph nodes (range=40-55.8 Gy). Most patients underwent chemoradiotherapy concurrently with 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) or gemcitabine. Result(s): The 2-year locoregional progression-free, distant metastasis-free and overall survival rates were 33.3%, 42.4% and 44.5%, respectively. High radiation dose >=50 Gy had a marginally significant impact on superior locoregional progression-free survival compared to 40 Gy (p=0.081). One patient developed grade 3 late gastrointestinal toxicity. Conclusion(s): Adjuvant chemoradiotherapy for EHBD cancer patients with gross residual disease after surgery was well-tolerated. There could be a chance for durable locoregional control and even long-term survival in selected patients.Copyright © 2014, International Institute of Anticancer Research.

1597,"Biodistribution and radiation dosimetry of deuterium-substituted 18F-fluoromethyl-[1, 2-2H4]choline in healthy volunteers. UNLABELLED: (11)C-choline and (18)F-fluoromethylcholine ((18)F-FCH) have been used in patients to study tumor metabolic activity in vivo; however, both radiotracers are readily oxidized to respective betaine analogs, with metabolites detectable in plasma soon after injection of the radiotracer. A more metabolically stable FCH analog, (18)F-fluoromethyl-[1,2-(2)H4]choline ((18)F-D4-FCH), based on the deuterium isotope effect, has been developed. We report the safety, biodistribution, and internal radiation dosimetry profiles of (18)F-D4-FCH in 8 healthy human volunteers., METHODS: (18)F-D4-FCH was intravenously administered as a bolus injection (mean +/- SD, 161 +/- 2.17 MBq; range, 156-163 MBq) to 8 healthy volunteers (4 men, 4 women). Whole-body (vertex to mid thigh) PET/CT scans were acquired at 6 time points, up to 4 h after tracer injection. Serial whole-blood, plasma, and urine samples were collected for radioactivity measurement and plasma radiotracer metabolites. Tissue (18)F radioactivities were determined from quantitative analysis of the images, and time-activity curves were generated. The total numbers of disintegrations in each organ normalized to injected activity (residence times) were calculated as the area under the curve of the time-activity curve normalized to injected activities and standard organ volumes. Dosimetry calculations were performed using OLINDA/EXM 1.1., RESULTS: The injection of (18)F-D4-FCH was well tolerated in all subjects, with no radiotracer-related serious adverse event reported. The mean effective dose averaged over both men and women (+/- SD) was estimated to be 0.025 +/- 0.004 (men, 0.022 +/- 0.002; women, 0.027 +/- 0.002) mSv/MBq. The 5 organs receiving the highest absorbed dose (mGy/MBq) were the kidneys (0.106 +/- 0.03), liver (0.094 +/- 0.03), pancreas (0.066 +/- 0.01), urinary bladder wall (0.047 +/- 0.02), and adrenals (0.046 +/- 0.01). Elimination was through the renal and hepatic systems., CONCLUSION: (18)F-D4-FCH is a safe PET radiotracer with a dosimetry profile comparable to other common (18)F PET tracers. These data support the further development of (18)F-D4-FCH for clinical imaging of choline metabolism.",Excluded
2306,"Injectable bone graft for the repair of nonunion of midshaft clavicular fracture after internal fixation. BACKGROUND: Treatment of nonunion of clavicular fractures usually requires the insertion of bone material to facilitate bone healing. Injectable bone grafts have been successfully used in the treatment of limb fractures and lumbar fusion. However, there are few studies on its use in the treatment of nonunion. OBJECTIVE(S): To investigate the clinical effect of injection bone graft in the treatment of nonunion of clavicle fracture after internal fixation. METHOD(S): Totally 13 patients (9 males and 4 females aged 19-54 years old) with nonunion after internal fixation of clavicular fractures in the middle segment of the clavicle, who were treated in the No. 908 Hospital of Joint Logistic Support Force of Chinese PLA from January 2015 to December 2016, were selected. All of them were treated with ALLOMATRIX injection bone graft. Postoperative follow-up was conducted for 12 months. The fracture healing quality was evaluated by Lane-Sandhu X-ray score, and the shoulder joint function was evaluated by Constant score. This experiment was approved by the Ethics Committee of No. 908 Hospital of Joint Logistic Support Force of Chinese PLA. RESULTS AND CONCLUSION(S): (1) All the 13 patients received osseous healing, which lasted 8-16 weeks, and no complications such as infection, dislocation, or fixator loosening occurred. (2) The total Lane-Sandhu X-ray score of 13 patients at 3 months and the last follow-up was higher than that before the operation (P < 0. 05).

OBJECTIVE: To determine whether the amount of tagged stool and fluid significantly affects the radiation exposure in low-dose screening CT colonography performed with an automatic tube-current modulation technique., METHODS: The study included 311 patients. The tagging agent was barium (n = 271) or iodine (n = 40). Correlation was measured between mean volume CT dose index (CTDI (vol)) and the estimated x-ray attenuation of the tagged stool and fluid (ATT). Multiple linear regression analyses were performed to determine the effect of ATT on CTDI (vol ) and the effect of ATT on image noise while adjusting for other variables including abdominal circumference., RESULTS: CTDI (vol) varied from 0.88 to 2.54 mGy. There was no significant correlation between CTDI (vol) and ATT (p = 0.61). ATT did not significantly affect CTDI (vol) (p = 0.93), while abdominal circumference was the only factor significantly affecting CTDI (vol) (p < 0.001). Image noise ranged from 59.5 to 64.1 HU. The p value for the regression model explaining the noise was 0.38., CONCLUSION: The amount of stool and fluid tagging does not significantly affect radiation exposure.",Excluded

Proton radiation therapy (PRT) offers dosimetric advantages for normal tissue sparing and may benefit previously irradiated patients. Here, we report our initial experience with the use of PRT for H&N reirradiation, with focus on clinical outcomes and toxicity., METHODS AND MATERIALS: We retrospectively reviewed the records of patients who received H&N reirradiation with PRT from April 2011 through June 2015. Patients reirradiated with palliative intent or without prior documentation of H&N radiation therapy were excluded. Radiation-related toxicities were recorded according to the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events Version 4.0., RESULTS: The conditions of 60 patients were evaluated, with a median follow-up time of 13.6 months. Fifteen patients (25%) received passive scatter proton therapy (PSPT), and 45 (75%) received intensity modulated proton therapy (IMPT). Thirty-five patients (58%) received upfront surgery, and 44 (73%) received concurrent chemotherapy. The 1-year rates of locoregional failure-free survival, overall survival, progression-free survival, and distant metastasis-free survival were 68.4%, 83.8%, 60.1%, and 74.9%, respectively. Eighteen patients (30%) experienced acute grade 3 (G3) toxicity, and 13 (22%) required a feeding tube at the end of PRT. The 1-year rates of late G3 toxicity and feeding tube independence were 16.7% and 2.0%, respectively. Three patients may have died of reirradiation-related effects (1 acute and 2 late)., CONCLUSIONS: Proton beam therapy can be a safe and effective curative reirradiation strategy, with acceptable rates of toxicity and durable disease control.

BACKGROUND: The risk of proximal humerus fractures increases with age and deterioration of bone quality over time, and the treatment of these injuries may be clinically challenging.The aim of this study was to analyse the relationship between local bone quality and the morphology of proximal humerus fractures. MATERIAL AND METHODS: We conducted a retrospective study of 187 patients diagnosed with proximal humerus fractures. X-ray images of all patients were analysed, and on this basis, bone quality was assessed, using the Deltoid Tuberosity Index (DTI), average cortical bone thickness (CBTavg) and the Tingart measurement. The type of fracture was classified according to Neer's and Association for Osteosynthesis (AO) classifications. Moreover, the caput-collum-diaphyseal (CCD) angle was measured and the relationships between valgus or varus fractures and the DTI, CBTAVG and Tingart parameters were investigated in all patients. RESULT(S): Using the Neer classification, the most common fracture type was type 3, found in 90 patients (48.1%). A total of 51 patients (27.3%) sustained an AO B1 fracture. Significantly lower mean DTI values were noted in patients with a Neer 4 fracture compared to those with Neer 3 (p = 0.02) and Neer 2 fractures (p = 0.03). Moreover, significantly higher mean DTI (p <0.00) and CBTAVG (p <0.025) values were noted in the group of patients with valgus fractures (CCD> 140). CONCLUSION(S): 1. In the group of patients diagnosed with a four-part fracture according to Neer, bone quality assessed using the Deltoid Tuberosity Index was significantly worse than in two- and three-part fractures. 2. Significantly higher bone quality, assessed on the basis of the DTI and CBTAVG indices, was observed among patients with valgus fractures compared to those with varus fractures.",Excluded
492,"Survival and prognostic factors in patients treated with stereotactic radiotherapy for brain metastases. Background. Stereotactic radiation therapy (SRT) of brain metastases is used with good effect around the world, but no consensus exists regarding which prognostic factors that are related to favourable or unfavourable prognosis after the treatment. A better definition of these factors will ensure a more precise application of the treatment. Material and methods. A consecutive cohort of the 198 patients treated for brain metastases with SRT without concurrent whole-brain radiation therapy at our department from 2001 to 2012 was retrospectively analysed. Results. Median survival was seven months and median time to clinical cerebral progression was eight months. The multivariate analysis revealed age >= 65 years, Performance Status >= 2, extracranial metastases and size of metastasis > 20 mm as independent prognostic factors related to shorter survival. No factors were independently related to clinical cerebral progression. Conclusion. We identified four prognostic factors related to survival after SRT for brain metastases. The grouping of patients by these factors is useful to determine the level of treatment. We discourage the delivery of SRT to patients with 3-4 unfavourable prognostic factors because of the very short median survival of two months.Copyright © 2015 Informa Healthcare.",Excluded

Wave front measurements were performed with a Hartmann-Shack aberrometer. To investigate lenticular spherical aberration, HOAs were examined in 28 eyes before and after phacoemulsification, followed by insertion of an aberration-free intraocular lens. The relationship between lens opacity grade and ocular and lenticular spherical aberrations were investigated., RESULTS: Mean spherical aberrations in groups 1, 2, 3, and 4 were 0.25 +/- 0.10, 0.16 +/- 0.13, 0.12 +/- 0.15, and 0.10 +/- 0.20 mum, respectively, and showed a significant difference with nuclear opacity grading (p = 0.001). The spherical aberration showed negative associations with nuclear opacity grading (r = -0.408, p < 0.001). The predominant change in HOAs after phacoemulsification was an increase in spherical aberration, and 86 % of lenticular spherical aberrations were presumed to have negative values.

Background and purpose Improvement of the results of radiotherapy by EGFR inhibitors is modest, suggesting significant intertumoural heterogeneity of response. To identify potential biomarkers, a preclinical trial was performed on ten different human squamous cell carcinoma xenografts of the head and neck (HNSCC) studying in vivo and ex vivo the effect of fractionated irradiation and EGFR inhibition. Local tumour control and tumour growth delay were correlated with potential biomarkers, e.g. EGFR gene amplification and radioresponse-associated gene expression profiles. Material and methods Local tumour control 120 days after end of irradiation was determined for fractionated radiotherapy alone (30 f, 6 weeks) or after simultaneous EGFR-inhibition with cetuximab. The EGFR gene amplification status was determined using FISH. Gene expression analyses were performed using an in-house gene panel. Results Six out of 10 investigated tumour models showed a significant increase in local tumour control for the combined treatment of cetuximab and fractionated radiotherapy compared to irradiation alone. For 3 of the 6 responding tumour models, an amplification of the EGFR gene could be demonstrated. Gene expression profiling of untreated tumours revealed significant differences between amplified and non-amplified tumours as well as between responder and non-responder tumours to combined radiotherapy and cetuximab. Conclusion The EGFR amplification status, in combination with gene expression profiling, may serve as a predictive biomarker for personalized interventional strategies regarding combined treatment of cetuximab and fractionated radiotherapy and should, as a next step, be clinically validated.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",Excluded

3626,"Individually adapted examination protocols for reduction of radiation exposure in chest CT. RATIONALE AND OBJECTIVES: To develop a simple directive for the reduction of radiation exposure without loss of diagnostic information in routine chest CT examinations., METHODS: Two hundred fifty adult patients (164 male, 86 female) were entered into a prospective trial. All examinations were performed with a multislice CT technique (Somatom Volume Zoom, Siemens). Four groups of 50 patients each were scanned with patient-related specific parameters: individual mA-s values were derived from the estimated body weight: kilograms + 10, +/- 0, - 10, and - 20 mAs. The results were compared with those of 50 patients who were examined by a standard chest protocol by using the parameters 120 mAs and 140 kV. All other parameters including the tube voltage were kept constant. Subjective image quality was rated on a three-point scale: 1 = excellent, 2 = fair, 3 = nondiagnostic. In addition, objective criteria based on signal-to-noise measurements were assessed by using a region-of-interest methodology., RESULTS: Image quality was sufficient in all cases. Mean subjective gradings of image quality, based on soft-tissue window settings, were 1.1 for the 120-mAs protocol, 1.1 for the (body weight [kg] + 10) mAs protocol, 1.1 for the (body weight [kg] +/- 0) mAs protocol, 1.3 for the (body weight [kg] - 10) mAs protocol, and 1.2 for the (body weight [kg] - 20) mAs protocol. Objective criteria based on noise measurements showed mean +/- standard deviation values of 5.7 +/- 0.8 Hounsfield units (HU) for the 120-mAs protocol. For the reduced-dose protocols, values were calculated as 7.6 +/- 1.2 HU (group + 10), 7.9 +/- 1.3 HU (group +/- 0), 8.7 +/- 1.2 HU (group - 10), and finally 9.1 +/- 1.3 HU (group - 20). The best correlation for an entire subgroup was achieved with the - 10 protocol (body weight [kg] - 10) mAs, with nearly constant noise related to body weight in all patients., CONCLUSIONS: By deriving mAs values from body weight estimation, an individually adapted protocol for chest CT can be recommended and easily employed in a clinical setting. With an adaptation of the tube current-time product based on the estimated body weight of the patient - 10 (body weight [kg] - 10 mAs), a well-balanced examination without significant loss of information, even in soft-tissue window settings, can be performed with this particular scanner. For this adapted mAs protocol, a mean reduction of radiation exposure of 45% was achievable, compared with the standard protocol. A maximum decrease per case down to 31 mAs was obtained, without relevant loss of image quality. Therefore, for other types of CT scanners, analogous protocols may be adapted.",Excluded
943,"Alterations in expression and structure of the DNA repair gene XRCC1. The repair-associated gene XRCC1 was previously cloned by complementing the hamster mutant EM9, which has a high rate of spontaneous SCE and hypersensitivity to DNA damaging agents. In analyzing XRCC1 gene expression, similar levels of steady-state mRNA were found in normal cells, Bloom's syndrome cells with altered SCE, and in squamous carcinoma cells with differential X-ray sensitivity. An EcoRI restriction fragment-length polymorphism previously identified in XRCC1 did not correlate with the repair phenotypes of these cells. The mRNA of XRCC1 decreased to 20-40% after treatment of cells with a DNA damaging agent. XRCC1 also showed tissue specific expression in rats. The mRNA levels were high in testis (7-8 fold), ovary (3-4 fold) and brain (4-5 fold), when compared with those in intestine, liver and spleen (1-2 fold). These data and the high levels of XRCC1 protein detected in testis indicate that XRCC1 may play an important role in DNA processing during meiogenesis and recombination in germ cells.",Excluded

Objective: To evaluate the effect of secukinumab, an interleukin-17A inhibitor, on clinical signs and symptoms and radiographic changes through 2 years in patients with ankylosing spondylitis (AS). Method(s): In the phase III MEASURE 1 study, patients were randomised to receive intravenous secukinumab 10 mg/kg (at baseline, week 2 and week 4) followed by subcutaneous secukinumab 150 mg (intravenous 150 mg; n=125) or 75 mg (intravenous 75 mg; n=124) every four weeks, or matched placebo (n=122). Placebo-treated patients were re-randomised to subcutaneous secukinumab 150 or 75 mg from week 16. Clinical efficacy assessments included Assessment of SpondyloArthritis international Society 20 (ASAS20) response rates through week 104. Radiographic changes at week 104 were assessed using the modified Stoke Ankylosing Spondylitis Spine Score (mSASSS). Result(s): 97 (77.6%) and 103 (83.1%) patients in the intravenous 150 mg and intravenous 75 mg groups, respectively, completed week 104. In the full analysis set (intent-to-treat), ASAS20 response rates at week 104 were 73.7% and 68.0% in the intravenous 150 mg and intravenous 75 mg groups, respectively. Among patients with evaluable X-rays who were originally randomised to secukinumab (n=168), mean change in mSASSS from baseline to week 104 was 0.30+/-2.53. Serious adverse events were reported in 12.2% and 13.4% of patients in the 150 mg and 75 mg groups, respectively. Conclusion(s): Secukinumab improved AS signs and symptoms through 2 years of therapy, with no unexpected safety findings. Data from this study suggest a low mean progression of spinal radiographic changes, which will need to be confirmed in longer-term controlled studies.",Excluded

In this preliminary study, we examined the association of the SIPA1 -313A>G (rs931127) polymorphism with overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) in 351 inoperable patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) treated with radiotherapy or radiochemotherapy (curative or palliative). The GG homozygotes had significantly shorter PFS under codominant and recessive models in all patients (hazard ratio (HR) 1.47, p = 0.035, and HR 1.47, p = 0.022, respectively) and in advanced stage subgroup (HR 1.49, p = 0.037, and HR 1.48, p = 0.023, respectively). The GG genotype was also associated with reduced OS and PFS (codominant model: HR 2.41, p = 0.020, and HR 2.34, p = 0.020, respectively; recessive model: HR 2.16, p = 0.026, and HR 2.18, p = 0.022, respectively) in radiotherapy alone subgroup. Moreover, the SIPA1 -313GG was identified as an independent adverse prognostic factor for PFS in the cohort. Our results indicate, for the first time, that the SIPA1 -313A>G may have a prognostic role in unresected NSCLC making it a potential predictor of poor survival due to earlier progression.Copyright © 2014, International Society of Oncology and BioMarkers (ISOBM).",Excluded
2980,"Current attitudes of Turkish anesthesiologists to radiation exposure. Purpose: The aim of this study was to investigate the attitudes of anesthesiologists to radiation exposure and current safety practice in Turkey. Method(s): The study enrolled anesthesiologists from all over Turkey, including all levels of academic degrees and all types of different institutions. Questionnaire forms were sent via e-mail to 505 anesthesiologists. The survey collected demographic data such as age, gender, position, and the institution at which the participant worked, and data about the frequency of radiation exposure during procedures and the participant's attitudes concerning radiation safety measures during these procedures. Result(s): The questionnaire forms were delivered to 491 anesthesiologists, and 301 (61.3 %) of these were returned. Of these, 9 had not completed the questionnaire because of a lack of exposure to radiation. Among the remaining 292 personnel, the weekly frequencies of radiation exposure were more than five times (36.7 %), one to five times (50.3 %), and less than once (13 %) per week, respectively. Only a few anesthesiologists regularly wore a lead apron (30.11 %) and a thyroid shield (11.3 %) during procedures involving radiation exposure. Conclusion(s): This study demonstrated that nearly all anesthesiologists are regularly exposed to radiation and that few anesthesiologists in Turkey wear protective clothing, which is essential for radiation protection. Therefore, if it is not, increasing awareness about radiation protection should be an integral part of medical training and education. © 2013 Japanese Society of Anesthesiologists.",Excluded
1062,"Rotational angiography for diagnosis and surgical planning in the management of spinal vascular lesions. OBJECT: The management of spinal vascular malformations has undergone significant evolution with the advent of advanced endovascular and angiographic technology. Three-dimensional rotational spinal angiography is an advanced tool that allows the surgeon to gain a better appreciation of the anatomy of these spinal vascular lesions and their relation to surrounding structures. This article describes the use of rotational angiography and 3D reconstructions in the diagnosis and management of spinal vascular malformations., METHODS: The authors present representative cases involving surgical treatment planning for spinal vascular malformations with focus on the utility and technique of rotational spinal angiography. They report the use of rotational spinal angiography for a heterogeneous collection of vascular pathological conditions., RESULTS: Eight patients underwent rotational spinal angiography in addition to digital subtraction angiography (DSA) for the diagnosis and characterization of various spinal vascular lesions. Postprocessed images were used to characterize the lesion in relation to surrounding bone and to enhance the surgeon's ability to precisely localize and obliterate the abnormality. The reconstructions provided superior anatomical detail compared with traditional DSA. No associated complications from the rotational angiography were noted, and there was no statistically significant difference in the amount of radiation exposure to patients undergoing rotational angiography relative to traditional angiography., CONCLUSIONS: The use of rotational spinal angiography provides a rapid and powerful diagnostic tool, superior to conventional DSA in the diagnosis and preoperative planning of a variety of spinal vascular pathology. A more detailed understanding of the anatomy of such lesions provided by this technique may improve the safety of the surgical approach.",Excluded

Objective: To compare the objective and subjective image quality indicators and radiation doses of computed tomography (CT) venography performed using model-based iterative reconstruction (MBIR) at 80 kVp and adaptive statistical iterative reconstruction (ASIR)-V at 70 kVp. Material(s) and Method(s): Eighty-three patients who had undergone CT venography of the lower extremities with MBIR at 80 kVp (Group A; 21 men and 20 women; mean age, 55.5 years) or ASIR-V at 70 kVp (Group B; 18 men and 24 women; mean age, 57.3 years) were enrolled. Two radiologists retrospectively evaluated the objective (vascular enhancement, image noise, signal-to-noise ratio [SNR], contrast-to-noise ratio [CNR]) and subjective (quantum mottle, delineation of contour, venous enhancement) image quality indicators at the inferior vena cava and femoral and popliteal veins. Clinical information, radiation dose, reconstruction time, and objective and subjective image quality indicators were compared between groups A and B. Result(s): Vascular enhancement, SNR, and CNR were significantly greater in Group B than in Group A (p <= 0.015). Image noise was significantly lower in Group B (p <= 0.021), and all subjective image quality indicators, except for delineation of vein contours, were significantly better in Group B (p <= 0.021). Mean reconstruction time was significantly shorter in Group B than in Group A (1 min 43 s vs. 131 min 1 s; p < 0.001). Clinical information and radiation dose were not significantly different between the two groups. Conclusion(s): CT venography using ASIR-V at 70 kVp was better than MBIR at 80 kVp in terms of image quality and reconstruction time at similar radiation doses.Copyright © 2019 The Korean Society of Radiology.",Excluded
2108,"Effects of beta radiation from organically bound tritium on cultured mouse embryonic mid brain cells. Effects of beta radiation from four kinds of organically bound tritium compounds were investigated on cultured mouse embryonic mid brain cells, isolated from 11-d-old mouse embryos. The MBC showed a critical time when they were more radiosensitive. Although dose-dependent inhibition was found for both cellular proliferation and differentiation, the differentiation was more sensitive to radiation than proliferation when compared at ID50, the inhibitory dose that reduced assessment value by 50% of the control. Dose-dependent decrease of DNA and protein contents were also observed. The relative biological effectiveness values, ranging from 4.6 to 8.7, of beta ray from organically bound tritium compounds were obtained when compared with x irradiation at their ID50s on the inhibition of cell proliferation and differentiation, and on the decrease of DNA and protein contents of the cultures. The mixed exposure to x ray and one kind of organically bound tritium compound or to any two kinds of organically bound tritium compound resulted in a more efficiently inhibitory effect on differentiation than the exposure to x ray or to any one kind of organically bound tritium compound alone, especially when methyl-3H-thymidine was used. Doses as low as 0.05 Gy (5 cGy) from a mixed exposure resulted in detectable inhibitory effects.",Excluded
243,"Transanal minimally-invasive surgery for treating patients with regressed rectal cancer after preoperative chemoradiotherapy. Purpose: Although the standard treatment for patients with locally advanced rectal cancer managed by preoperative chemoradiotherapy (CRT) is a radical resection, local excisions are used in highly-selective cases. Recently, transanal minimally-invasive surgery (TAMIS) has emerged as a feasible technique for local excision of midrectal lesions. We assess the feasibility of using TAMIS to treat patients with locally advanced rectal cancer who showed good response to CRT. Method(s): From October 2010 to June 2013, 35 consecutive patients with rectal cancer managed by using preoperative CRT underwent TAMIS. After a single-incision laparoscopic surgery port had been introduced into the anal canal, a fullthickness local excision with conventional laparoscopic instruments was performed. We retrospectively reviewed a prospectively collected database of these cases. Result(s): Of the 35 patients analyzed, 18 showed pathologic complete responses and 17 had residual lesions (2 ypTis, 4 ypT1, 9 ypT2, and 2 ypT3); 34 (97.1%) showed clear deep, lateral margins. The median distance of lesions from the anal verge was 5 cm. All procedures were completed laparoscopically, and the median operating time was 84 minutes. No intraoperative events or morbidities were seen in any of the patients, except one with wound dehiscence, who was treated conservatively. The median postoperative hospital stay and follow-up period were 4 days and 36 months, respectively. During the study period, no patients died, but 5 (14.3%) experienced recurrence, including one recurrence at the TAMIS site. Conclusion(s): TAMIS seems to be a feasible, safe modality for treating patients with locally advanced rectal cancer who show good response to preoperative CRT.Copyright © 2017 The Korean Society of Coloproctology.",Excluded

However, it has been suggested that they could be involved in the aetiology of some types of brain tumours. Objective(s): The objective was to analyse the association between mobile phone exposure and primary central nervous system tumours (gliomas and meningiomas) in adults. Method(s): CERENAT is a multicenter case-control study carried out in four areas in France in 2004-2006. Data about mobile phone use were collected through a detailed questionnaire delivered in a face-to-face manner. Conditional logistic regression for matched sets was used to estimate adjusted ORs and 95% CIs. Result(s): A total of 253 gliomas, 194 meningiomas and 892 matched controls selected from the local electoral rolls were analysed. No association with brain tumours was observed when comparing regular mobile phone users with non-users (OR=1.24; 95% CI 0.86 to 1.77 for gliomas, OR=0.90; 95% CI 0.61 to 1.34 for meningiomas). However, the positive association was statistically significant in the heaviest users when considering life-long cumulative duration (>=896 h, OR=2.89; 95% CI 1.41 to 5.93 for gliomas; OR=2.57; 95% CI 1.02 to 6.44 for meningiomas) and number of calls for gliomas (>=18 360 calls, OR=2.10, 95% CI 1.03 to 4.31). Risks were higher for gliomas, temporal tumours, occupational and urban mobile phone use.

Background: The impact of novel alternative access and valve type on radiation exposure during transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) has not yet been evaluated. This study sought to determine the impact of a transarterial approach and prosthesis type on physician and patient exposure to radiation during TAVR. Method(s): This was a prospective study including 140 consecutive patients undergoing TAVR by transfemoral (n = 102) or transcarotid (TC) (n = 38) access at 2 centers. Implanted valves were the self-expanding Evolut R/PRO system (Medtronic, Minneapolis, MN; n = 38) and the balloon-expandable SAPIEN 3 valve (Edwards Lifesciences, Irvine, CA; n = 102). The primary endpoint was first operator radiation exposure. The secondary endpoint was patient radiation exposure. Result(s): First operator radiation exposure was 4-fold greater during TC TAVR (P < .001). The use of a self-expanding valve was associated with a longer x-ray time (P = .015) and a 2-fold greater first operator radiation dose (P = .018). Patient radiation dose was not significantly affected by arterial approach (P = .055) or valve type (P = .095). After adjustment for potential confounders, the TC approach remained associated with a 174.8% (95% confidence interval, 80.6-318.3, P < .001) increase in first operator radiation dose, whereas the use of a self-expanding valve no longer influenced the first operator dose (P = .630). Conclusion(s): TC access and the use of a self-expanding valve were associated with a 4- and 2-fold greater first operator radiation exposure during TAVR procedures, respectively.

To define the role of stereotactic radiosurgery in the treatment of metastatic brain tumors we treated 24 consecutive patients (20 men, 4 women) with the 201-source 60Co gamma unit between May 1988 and March 1990. The primary tumors included malignant melanoma (n = 10), non-small cell lung carcinoma (n = 6), renal cell carcinoma (n = 3), colorectal carcinoma (n = 1), oropharyngeal carcinoma (n = 1), and adenocarcinoma of unknown origin (n = 3). All tumors were less than or equal to 3.0 cm in greatest diameter. Twenty patients received a planned combination of 30-40 Gy whole brain fractionated irradiation and a radiosurgical ""boost"" of 16-20 Gy to the tumor margins; one patient refused conventional fractionated irradiation. Three patients with recurrent, persistent, or new non-small cell lung carcinomas had radiosurgical treatment 12-20 months after receiving 30-42.5 Gy whole-brain external beam irradiation. Stereotactic computed tomographic imaging was used for target coordinate determination and imaging-integrated dose planning. All tumors were enclosed by the 50-90% isodose shell using one (n = 22), two (n = 1), or three (n = 1) irradiation isocenters. During this 23-month period (median follow-up of 7 months) no patient died from progression of a radiosurgically-treated brain metastasis.

437,"In vitro effects of simulated microgravity on Sertoli cell function. With the advent of space flights questions concerning the effects of microgravity (0G) on human reproductive physiology have received great attention. The aim of this study was to evaluate the influence of 0G on Sertoli cells. A Sertoli cell line from mouse testis (42GPA9) was analyzed for cytoskeletal and Sex Hormone Binding Globilin (SHBG) changes by immunohistochemistry, for antioxidant content by RT-PCR and for culture medium lactate concentrations by protein chemistry. Cells were cultured for 6, 24 and 48 h on a three-dimensional Random Positioning Machine (3D-RPM); static controls (1G) were positioned on the supporting frame. At the end of each experiment, cultured cells were either fixed in paraformaldehyde or lysed and RNA-extracted or used for culture medium lactate measurements as needed. At 0G, Sertoli cytoskeleton became disorganized, microtubules fragmented and SHBG undetectable already after 24 h, with alterations worsening by 48 h. It was evident that various antioxidant systems appreciably increased during the first 24 h but significantly decreased at 48 h. No changes occurred in the 1G samples. Initially, 0G seemed to disturb antioxidant protection strategies allowing the testes to support sperm production, thus generating an aging-like state of oxidative stress. Lactate production at 0G slightly decreased after 24 h. Further experiments are needed in space to investigate upon steroidogenesis and germ cell differentiation within the testis, to rule out male infertility as a possible consequence, which could be a problem, as life expectancy increases. 2010 COSPAR.

Background: Loss of skeletal muscle mass(MM) increases the risk for morbidity and mortality in hemodialysis (HD) patients. Dual energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) is a valid tool for assessing skeletal MM but limited by cost and radiation exposure. In contrast, bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA) is cheap and has no radiation exposure risk. Aim of this study was to assess the concordance between MM measured by BIA and DXA in HD patients. Method(s): We enrolled 55 clinically stable HD patients. Body composition, including appendicular lean muscle mass (ALM), was evaluated by BIA (Inbody S10) and whole body DXA (HOLOGIC). Hand grip strength (HGS) was performed to evaluate muscle performance. Agreement between tools was assessed by means of the Bland Altman method. Multiple linear regression was used to develop an ALM value by BIA closed to that by DXA. Result(s): The mean age was 63.4+/-11.29 years (range 39 to 88 years) and 65.5% were men. The prevalence of diabetes and hypertension was 54.5% and 94.5%, respectively. There was a significant association between muscle mass index which determined via DXA and BIA. The mean value of ALM divided by the height2 (AMMI) was found to be 5.98+/-0.90 kg/m2 and 7.90 +/-1.39 kg/m2 by DXA and by BIA, respectively, indicating overestimation of ALM in BIA method. BIA overestimated total body lean mass in 98% of participants. Bland-Altman plots for differences in AMMI between BIA and DXA showed large bias (Mean= 1.92kg/m2), with significant mean differences ([0.29, 3.55], P<0.001). After adjusting for sex, age and BMI, AMMI by BIA was significantly correlated with those measure by DXA (R2=0.643, P<0.001). Using the formula, we can estimate the AMMI by DXA with AMMI by BIA (DXA=0.859+0.452BIA+0.068BMI, R2=0.709, P<0.001). Mean HGS was 24.6+/-7.90 kg and AMMI showed no correlation with the HGS. Conclusion(s): Our results showed that AMMI measured by BIA is reliable but overestimated in HD patients.

To evaluate the efficacy of 308-nm excimer light therapy for Japanese psoriasis patients, seven patients (six men and one woman) with plaque-type psoriasis were treated with 308-nm excimer light at 7-14-day intervals. The Psoriasis Severity Index (PSI) was calculated for individual plaques in order to assess the effectiveness of the therapy. A 74.9% mean improvement in the PSI was observed after 10 treatment sessions. These results suggested that targeted irradiation with 308-nm excimer light leads to rapid and selective improvement in plaque-type psoriatic lesions without unnecessary radiation exposure to the surrounding unaffected skin.",Excluded
146,"Dynamic CTA in Native Kidneys Using a Multiphase CT Protocol-Potential of Significant Reduction of Contrast Medium. RATIONALE AND OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to assess an optimized renal multiphase computed tomography angiography (MP-CTA) protocol regarding reduction of contrast volume., MATERIALS AND METHODS: Thirty patients underwent MP-CTA (12 phases, every 3.5 seconds, 80 kV/120 mAs) using 30 mL of contrast medium. The quality of MP-CTA was assessed quantitatively measuring vessel attenuation, image noise, and contrast-to-noise ratio. MP-CTA was evaluated qualitatively regarding depiction of vessels, cortex differentiation, and motion artifacts (grades 1-4, 1 = best). Mean effective radiation dose was registered. Results were compared to standard renal computed tomography angiography (CTA) (80 mL). Student t test was applied, if variables followed normal distribution. For other variables, nonparametric Mann-Whitney U test was used., RESULTS: All acquisitions were successfully performed, and no patient had to be excluded from the study. MP-CTA enabled high attenuation (aorta: 503 +/- 91 HU, renal arteries: 450 +/- 73 HU/456 +/- 72 HU) at adequate image noise (13.7 +/- 1.5) and good contrast-to-noise ratio (34.2 +/- 10.2). Good attenuation of renal veins was observed (286 +/- 43 HU/282 +/- 42 HU). Arterial enhancement was significantly higher compared to renal CTA (aorta: 396 +/- 90 HU, renal arteries: 331 +/- 74 HU/333 +/- 80 HU; P < .001). MP-CTA protocol enabled good image quality of renal arteries (1.5 +/- 0.6) and veins (1.7 +/- 0.6). Cortex differentiation and motion artifacts were ranked 1.8 +/- 0.8 and 1.6 +/- 0.8. The mean effective radiation dose was 9 mSv (MP-CTA)., CONCLUSIONS: Compared to standard renal CTA, the renal MP-CTA enabled the significant reduction of contrast volume and simultaneously provided a significantly higher arterial attenuation.

2326,"Treatment of idiopathic hemifacial spasm with radiosurgery or hypofractionated stereotactic radiotherapy: Preliminary results. Introduction: Microvascular decompression in the posterior cranial fossa is the first treatment option for hemifacial spasm. For patients not suitable for surgery because of advanced age, poor general conditions or patients who refuse surgery, radiotherapeutic treatment could be an alternative. Only one case of resolution of hemifacial spasm in a patient undergoing radiosurgery for an intracanalicular vestibular schwannoma has been described in the literature. In this article we present three patients affected by idiopathic hemifacial spasm, refractory to medical therapy and botulinum toxin injections, who were treated by radiosurgery in one case and hypofractionated stereotactic radiotherapy in the other two. Method(s): Radiosurgery, with a single dose of 8Gy, was used in the first patient affected by idiopathic hemifacial spasm and autoimmune polyneuropathy with severe hypoacusia; hypofractionated stereotactic radiotherapy, with 15Gy in 5 fractions of 3Gy each, was preferred in the other 2 cases. In all patients, the target consisted of the vestibulocochlear-facial bundle immediately before its entry into the internal acoustic foramen. Result(s): A marked improvement of symptoms was observed in 2 patients, and almost complete disappearance in the other case, with no complications, particularly, auditory. Conclusion(s): The mean follow-up time of 24 months reported here could be judged too short, and our series too small, but the good results observed so far lead us to underline that, as in trigeminal neuralgia, radiosurgery or hypofractionated stereotactic radiotherapy could represent a therapeutic alternative to microvascular decompression for idiopathic hemifacial spasm for patients not suitable for surgery. © Georg Thieme Verlag KG Stuttgart .

3401,"Breast conservation in early and locally advanced breast cancer: Regional cancer centre, JIPMER experience. Introduction and Objectives: Breast preservation is the standard care for early breast cancer. The therapeutic challenges of locally advanced stage are well recognized, especially increased risk of local recurrence. However, with introduction of neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NACT), significant tumour regression is achieved, thereby permitting breast conservation, hence a non-randomized single arm study was conducted. Material(s) and Method(s): From 2007 to 2014 one hundred & ten patients were recruited. 59 out of 110 underwent NACT. All underwent lumpectomy and axillary dissection & intraoperatively template guided rigid/flexible needle with 2 or 3 plane. After 2D/3D based CT - planning, HDR dose of 15-16 Gy/2 - 2.5 Gy/# BD given for 3-5 days. Whole breast irradiation (46-50 Gy) was delivered after a 2-3 weeks' gap. CTV & DHI parameters were studied. Acute skin toxicity assessed at end of treatment. Cosmetic assessment done at 3 months according to Harvard scale. Unpaired t and Chi-square tests were used for analysis of parameters. Result(s): The ipsilateral breast tumour recurrence rate was (5) 4.5% with median follow up 5.4 years. Mean D90 (91.5%) and V90 (90.7%). Mean V100 was 84.20%. DHI range 0.7-0.8. The ipsilateral breast except the CTV (Breast-CTV) received a mean dose of 33.2%. Mean dose received by heart was 7.2%. Mean dose received by contralateral breast was (V5%) 1.6% & (V10%) 0.08%. Mean dose received by ipsilateral lung was (V5%) 46% & 18% (V10%). Mean dose to skin is significantly 24.9% brachytherapy. Excellent/good overall cosmesis is observed in 69 patients and fair/poor cosmesis observed in 32 patients. Poor cosmesis was observed in 9 patients. Conclusion(s): Breast conservation treatment options show comparable local control with acceptable dosimetric parameters & cosmetic outcomes even in LABC. With careful patient selection, optimal treatment planning, and careful attention to excision margins & radiation doses, breast conservation can be performed in these patients without sacrificing local control of disease.",Excluded
3300,"Skin cancer risk perception and sun protection behavior at work, at leisure, and on sun holidays: A survey for Danish outdoor and indoor workers 11 Medical and Health Sciences 1117 Public Health and Health Services. Background: To prevent occupational skin cancer, it is essential that the sun-protective behavior of outdoor workers is adequate. The aim is to study the sun-protective behavior of Danish outdoor workers at work, at leisure, and on sun holiday and compare it to that of indoor workers. Method(s): This is a cross-sectional study, based on a 53-item survey completed by Danish outdoor (n = 380) and indoor workers (n = 119) in 2016-2017. Status as outdoor or indoor worker was decided based on self-report and behavioral differences were tested using (paired) t tests and multiple regression adjusted for age, sex, educational level, history of smoking, and skin type. Result(s): Danish outdoor workers at work use sun protection less than they do at leisure and on sun holiday (alpha <.05) where their sun protection behavior is similar to that of indoor workers. The proportion of Danish outdoor workers that always/often use sun protection at work is for shade seeking around noon 4.2%, sunscreen 34.5%, wide-brimmed hat 25.3%, and long trousers and shirt with sleeves 42.4%. Of Danish outdoor workers, 49.5% do not think about the risk of occupational skin cancer and 11.8% think the risk is insignificant, 32.4% think that the use of sun protection is of low or no importance, 84.2% consider sunburn important as skin cancer risk factor still 88.9% have a history of sunburn at work, > 80.0% agree that risk of skin cancer is reduced by the use of sun protection, and only 4.0% dismiss the possibility of sun protection use at work. Conclusion(s): Skin cancer risk and use of sun protection at work are largely neglected in Danish outdoor workers, more so than at leisure and on sun holiday where their risk behavior resembles that of indoor workers. This indicates an untapped workplace preventive potential.Copyright © 2018 The Author(s).",Excluded
2181,"Occurrence of Phosphenes in Patients Undergoing Proton Beam Therapy for Ocular Tumor. Purpose: Phosphenes are frequently reported by patients irradiated in the head and neck area. The aim of the present study was to characterize and investigate potential mechanisms of proton beam therapy (PBT)-induced phosphenes in a large population of patients undergoing PBT for ocular tumors. Design(s): Prospective cohort study. Method(s): Consecutive patients who underwent PBT in a single center were included. Immediately after the first session, all patients completed a questionnaire collecting information about the presence of phosphenes as well as their color, shape, and duration. Patient, tumor and treatment characteristics (dose volume histograms) were also collected. Result(s): Among the 474 patients included, 62.8% reported phosphenes during the first session of PBT. Reported colors were mainly blue-violet (70.5%) and white (14.1%). The prevalence of phosphenes was higher in younger patients (P =.003); other patient or ocular characteristics were not associated with the occurrence of phosphenes. Irradiation of the macula (P <.001) and/or optic disc (P <.001) were significantly associated with the presence of phosphenes, whereas blue-violet color was only associated with young age and irradiation of macular area (P =.04). Pupillary constriction was reported for 57.1% of patients with phosphenes vs 18.5% of patients without (P <.001). Blue-violet phosphenes (P <.001) and irradiation of macula (P =.001) were statistically associated with pupillary constriction. Conclusion(s): The present study reported a high rate of phosphenes in patients irradiated by PBT for ocular tumor. Their blue-violet color and their association with a pupillary constriction probably indicates the stimulation of S-cones and retinal ganglion cells that reflects the activation of the afferent visual pathway.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.",Excluded
1243,"Hypothesis testing, statistical power, and confidence limits in the presence of epistemic uncertainty. Hypothesis testing, statistical power, and confidence limits are concepts from classical statistics that require data from observations. In some important recent applications some of the data are not observational but are reconstructed by computer models. There is generally epistemic uncertainty in model formulations, as well as in parameter and input values. The resulting epistemic uncertainty of the reconstructed data is determined by an uncertainty analysis and is expressed by subjective probability distributions. Sometimes only the mean or median values of the distributions are used in the concepts mentioned above, which hides the uncertainty of the data thereby rendering misleading results. Misleading results are also obtained if the epistemic uncertainty of the data is combined incorrectly with the stochastic variability of the outcome of the actual random complex concerned. This paper argues that an uncertainty analysis of the application of classical statistical concepts is essentially the correct way of dealing with the epistemic uncertainty of the data. A practical example serves as an illustration.",Excluded
2645,"Randomized phase II chemotherapy and radiotherapy trial for patients with locally advanced inoperable non-small-cell lung cancer: long-term follow-up of RTOG 92-04. PURPOSE: The standard treatment for patients with locally advanced inoperable non-small-cell lung cancer and good prognostic factors has become combined chemotherapy (ChT) and radiotherapy (RT). However, the sequencing of the two modalities, as well as fractionation of RT, has been controversial. The Radiation Therapy Oncology Group (RTOG) Study 92-04 was a randomized Phase II study designed to evaluate further the toxicity and efficacy of 2 different strategies of chemoradiation evaluated in 2 prior RTOG Phase II studies., METHODS: Patients with Stage II or III medically inoperable or unresectable non-small-cell lung cancer, good performance status, and minimal weight loss were enrolled into a prospective randomized Phase II RTOG study. Arm 1 consisted of induction ChT (vinblastine 5 mg/m(2) i.v. bolus weekly for the first 5 weeks, and cisplatin, 100 mg/m(2) i.v. on Days 1 and 29) followed by concurrent ChT/RT (cisplatin 75 mg/m(2) i.v. on Days 50, 71, and 92) during thoracic radiotherapy (63 Gy in 34 fractions during 7 weeks starting on Day 50). Arm 2 was concurrent ChT and hyperfractionated RT starting on Day 1 with a total dose of 69.6 Gy in 58 fractions during 6 weeks, 1.2 Gy/fraction b.i.d. ChT consisted of cisplatin, 50 mg/m(2) i.v. on Days 1 and 8, and oral VP-16, 50 mg b.i.d. for 10 days only on the days of thoracic radiotherapy repeated on Day 29., RESULTS: A total of 168 patients were entered between 1992 and 1994, and 163 patients were eligible for analysis. Eighty-one patients were treated in Arm 1 and 82 patients in Arm 2. Pretreatment characteristics, including age, gender, Karnofsky performance status, histologic features, and stage, were similar. The incidence of acute esophagitis was significantly higher among patients treated in Arm 2 than among those treated in Arm 1 (p <0.0001). The incidence of acute hematologic toxicity was significantly higher among patients treated in Arm 1 (p = 0.01 for anemia and p = 0.03 for other hematologic toxicities) than among those treated in Arm 2. Analysis of late toxicity showed that chronic esophageal toxicity was significantly more frequent in Arm 2 than in Arm 1 (p = 0.003). The time to in-field progression was significantly different (p = 0.009), favoring Arm 2 compared with Arm 1 (26% vs. 45% with failure in 2 years and 30% vs. 49% with failure in 4 years, respectively). The median 2-year and overall 5-year survival rates were similar between the two arms., CONCLUSION: Concurrent ChT and hyperfractionated RT resulted in a significant prolongation of the time to in-field progression, but with higher acute and chronic esophagitis. No other significant differences were observed between the two groups. Investigation with a chemoradio-protector is under way.",Excluded
2880,"Evaluation of endogenous control gene(s) for gene expression studies in human blood exposed to 60Co gamma-rays ex vivo. In gene expression studies, it is critical to normalize data using a stably expressed endogenous control gene in order to obtain accurate and reliable results. However, we currently do not have a universally applied endogenous control gene for normalization of data for gene expression studies, particularly those involving (60)Co gamma-ray-exposed human blood samples. In this study, a comparative assessment of the gene expression of six widely used housekeeping endogenous control genes, namely 18S, ACTB, B2M, GAPDH, MT-ATP6 and CDKN1A, was undertaken for a range of (60)Co gamma-ray doses (0.5, 1.0, 2.0 and 4.0 Gy) at 8.4 Gy min(-1) at 0 and 24 h post-irradiation time intervals. Using the NormFinder algorithm, real-time PCR data obtained from six individuals (three males and three females) were analyzed with respect to the threshold cycle (Ct) value and abundance, DELTACt pair-wise comparison, intra- and inter-group variability assessments, etc. GAPDH, either alone or in combination with 18S, was found to be the most suitable endogenous control gene and should be used in gene expression studies, especially those involving qPCR of gamma-ray-exposed human blood samples.

Method(s): We treated 38 Korean patients with conventional PUVA and 54 with D-PUVA. We compared the total number, duration and total UVA dose of PUVA therapy to reach grade 4 between two groups. We categorized each patient into clearing, improvement, or failure groups based on the therapeutic efficacy, and evaluated PASI score at patient's visits. Result(s): The irradiation number and total cumulative dose of D-PUVA phototherapy to achieve grade 4 were significantly smaller than PUVA phototherapy. Conclusion(s): Combining PUVA with a vitamin D analogue, calcipotriol, in the treatment of psoriasis may lead to lowering the risk of long-term exposure to UV radiation with higher efficacy.",Excluded

PURPOSE: This Phase I study was designed to evaluate the tolerability of involved-field radiotherapy (IFRT) to areas of persistent disease in patients with high-risk Hodgkin's disease and non-Hodgkin's lymphomas before autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT)., METHODS AND MATERIALS: Thirty-one patients with primary refractory or relapsed Hodgkin's disease (n = 13) and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (n = 18) were treated with IFRT followed by high-dose chemotherapy and ASCT. All patients had bulky disease (> or =5 cm) and/or an inadequate response to salvage chemotherapy. The IFRT dose was escalated to a maximum of 36 Gy. Dose-limiting toxicity was defined as Grade 3-4 Bearman toxicity (life-threatening/fatal toxicity occurring within 28 days of ASCT). The chemotherapy regimen consisted of cyclophosphamide, etoposide, and carmustine., RESULTS: The delivered dose of IFRT was 20 Gy in 9 patients, 28-30 Gy in 20, and 32-36 Gy in 2 patients to mediastinal (n = 19) and nonmediastinal (n = 12) sites. The median interval between IFRT completion and ASCT was 19 days. One patient developed Bearman Grade 3 hepatic toxicity. No other Grade 3 or 4 Bearman toxicity was observed. An increased requirement for i.v. narcotics was observed in patients treated with mediastinal IFRT vs. nonmediastinal IFRT (p = 0.02). A trend toward increased mucositis severity was seen in patients previously treated with a larger number of chemotherapy agents (p = 0.09) and in those with a shorter interval between IFRT and ASCT (p = 0.12). Pulmonary toxicity was more common in patients treated with mediastinal IFRT than in those treated with nonmediastinal IFRT (21% vs. 0%, p = 0.13). The 2-year overall and progression-free survival rate was 70% and 49% for all patients, 84% and 50% for patients with Hodgkin's disease, and 59% and 47% for patients with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, respectively., CONCLUSION: The maximal tolerated dose of IFRT was not reached when Grade 3-4 Bearman toxicity was dose limiting. Increased pulmonary toxicity and mucositis severity was seen after mediastinal IFRT compared with nonmediastinal IFRT. Because local control was excellent, higher doses of IFRT are not recommended. The absolute benefit of IFRT in this patient population needs investigation in future studies.",Excluded

OBJECTIVE: While nuclear myocardial perfusion imaging (MPI) offers many benefits to patients with known or suspected cardiovascular disease, concerns exist regarding radiation-associated health effects. Little is known regarding MPI practice in Africa. We sought to characterise radiation doses and the use of MPI best practices that could minimise radiation in African nuclear cardiology laboratories, and compare these to practice worldwide., METHODS: Demographics and clinical characteristics were collected for a consecutive sample of 348 patients from 12 laboratories in six African countries over a one-week period from March to April 2013. Radiation effective dose (ED) was estimated for each patient. A quality index (QI) enumerating adherence to eight best practices, identified a priori by an IAEA expert panel, was calculated for each laboratory. We compared these metrics with those from 7 563 patients from 296 laboratories outside Africa., RESULTS: Median (interquartile range) patient ED in Africa was similar to that of the rest of the world [9.1 (5.1-15.6) vs 10.3 mSv (6.8-12.6), p = 0.14], although a larger proportion of African patients received a low ED, <= 9 mSv targeted in societal recommendations (49.7 vs 38.2%, p < 0.001). Bestpractice adherence was higher among African laboratories (QI score: 6.3 +/- 1.2 vs 5.4 +/- 1.3, p = 0.013). However, median ED varied significantly among African laboratories (range: 2.0-16.3 mSv; p < 0.0001) and QI range was 4-8., CONCLUSION: Patient radiation dose from MPI in Africa was similar to that in the rest of the world, and adherence to best practices was relatively high in African laboratories. Nevertheless there remain opportunities to further reduce radiation exposure to African patients from MPI.",Excluded

Xeroderma pigmentosum (XP) patients with a defect in the nucleotide excision repair gene XPA, develop tumors with a high frequency on sun-exposed areas of the skin. Here we describe that hairless XPA-deficient mice also develop skin tumors with a short latency time and a 100% prevalence after daily exposure to low doses of U.V.B. Surprisingly and in contrast to U.V.B.-exposed repair proficient hairless mice who mainly develop squamous cell carcinomas, the XPA-deficient mice developed papillomas with a high frequency (31%) at a U.V. dose of 32 J/m2 daily. At the highest daily dose of 80 J/m2 mainly squamous cell carcinomas (56%) and only 10% of papillomas were found in XPA-deficient hairless mice. p53 gene mutations were examined in exons 5, 7 and 8 and were detected in only 3 out of 37 of these skin tumors, whereas in tumors of control U.V.B.-irradiated wild type littermates this frequency was higher (45%) and more in line with our previous data. Strikingly, a high incidence of activating ras gene mutations were observed in U.V.B.-induced papillomas (in 11 out of 14 tumors analysed). In only two out of 14 squamous cell carcinomas we found similar ras gene mutations. The observed shift from squamous cell carcinomas in wild type hairless mice to papillomas in XPA-deficient hairless mice, and a corresponding shift in mutated cancer genes in these tumors, provide new clues on the pathogenesis of chemically- versus U.V.B.-induced skin carcinogenesis.",Excluded

This study aimed to determine the zinc status and its relationship with demographic factors and chelation therapy in beta-thalassemia major (beta-TM) patients. This cross-sectional study was conducted on 102 beta-thalassemia (beta-thal), patients. Zinc level was evaluated in subjects using the atomic absorption method. The results were analyzed through descriptive statistics, chi 2 and Mann-Whitney U tests. Of 102 cases, 92 patients were eligible and evaluated. The mean age was 23 (minimum 11, maximum 43) years. Forty-six percent of cases were males and 54.0% were females. Of the 92 patients taking iron chelators, 29.3% used deferoxamine (DFO), 16.3% deferasirox (DFX), 20.6% DFO and deferiprone (DFP), and 33.8% DFO and DFP. All cases had zinc deficiency, 89.1% had zinc levels <40.0 mg/dL, and 10.9% with zinc levels >40.0 mg/dL. There was a significant relationship between gender and group with zinc levels greater than 40.0 mg/dL and those with less than 40.0 mg/dL. Zinc deficiency is highly prevalent among patients with thalassemia in the city of Yasuj, Iran. There was a significant relationship between zinc levels and gender although no significance was observed between zinc level and age, body mass index (BMI), ferritin, and chelation factors; it is recommended that these patients be periodically evaluated for zinc level.

Background There is a lack of expertise in the rheumatoid arthritis (RA) diagnosis in primary level medical centers in Colombia. Frequently, patients with osteoarthritis (OA) are misdiagnosed as rheumatoid arthritis (RA) in primary care centers, leading to wrong treatment and consequent clinical and pharmacoeconomic impact Objectives The objective of this study was to describe demographic and clinical characteristics of a cohort of patients derived to a specialized RA center with presumptive RA diagnosis and finally diagnosed as osteoarthritis Methods A descriptive, cross sectional study. Patients were referred and assisted to a specialized RA center in a 24 month period with presumptive diagnosis of this disease. A complete medical record was fulfilled by a rheumatologist; it was measured rheumatoid factor and anti-citrullinated antibodies, and other laboratories depending on each case. Also were made x-rays of hands, and in some cases of persistent doubt about the diagnosis was requested comparative MRI of hands. Frequencies and Percentages were calculated for the demographic and clinical characteristics of the cohort of patients Results From a total of 3665 Patients derived to specialized in RA center with presumptive RA diagnosis, after medical and laboratory evaluation 1451 (39.6%) had a wrong RA diagnosis; of them 1116 patients (76.9%) had finally osteoarthritis diagnosis. Of these patients 790 (70.7%) were women and 326 (29.2%) men, with an average age of 59.7 (+/-12 years).

938,"Sexual Function, Quality of Life, and Mood After Radiation Therapy in Patients with Anal Cancer. PURPOSE/OBJECTIVE(S): Definitive chemoradiation (CRT) results in high cure rates of anal cancer, with advanced radiation (RT) techniques improving toxicity. However, there is limited data regarding these patients' sexual function (SF), quality of life (QOL), and mood. We hypothesized that anal cancer treatment would result in detrimental effects on SF, QOL, and mood., MATERIALS/METHODS: We prospectively surveyed patients with anal cancer treated with definitive CRT. We assessed SF for women with the Female Sexual Function Index (FSFI) and for men with the International Index of Erectile Function (IIEF). For all patients, we assessed QOL using EORTC QLQ-C30 and CR29 and mood using the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS). We reported descriptive statistics for SF, QOL, and mood and used univariate analysis to evaluate predictors of SF for women., RESULTS: Of 50 eligible patients, 84% completed the surveys. Median time from RT until survey was 36 months (1-97 months). Women (n = 34) reported poor SF overall (mean FSFI score = 15, scale 2-36, standard deviation (SD) 10.4). Most women reported poor SF related to satisfaction, desire, orgasm, arousal, pain, and lubrication. Men (n = 8) also had poor overall satisfaction (mean IIEF score = 6.1, scale 2-10, SD 3.6). Men reported poor erectile function and lower satisfaction with intercourse. Mean QLQ-C30 QOL score was 86.5 (SD 16.3). Results from EORTC QLQ-CR-20 demonstrated patients experienced poor sexual interest. Per HADS, 2.5% reported depression and 18% anxiety., CONCLUSION: Patients with anal cancer experience sexual dysfunction after RT, with QOL and mood symptoms similar to patients with other cancers. Our data support the need for ongoing efforts to understand and address issues with SF, QOL, and mood following RT for these patients.",Excluded
3285,"Elective lymph node irradiation with intensity-modulated radiotherapy: Is conventional dose fractionation necessary?. Purpose: Intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) is the standard of care for head-and-neck cancer (HNC). We treated patients with HNC by delivering either a moderate hypofractionation (MHF) schedule (66 Gy at 2.2 Gy per fraction to the gross tumor [primary and nodal]) with standard dose fractionation (54-60 Gy at 1.8-2.0 Gy per fraction) to the elective neck lymphatics or a conventional dose and fractionation (CDF) schedule (70 Gy at 2.0 Gy per fraction) to the gross tumor (primary and nodal) with reduced dose to the elective neck lymphatics. We analyzed these two cohorts for treatment outcomes. Methods and Materials: Between November 2001 and February 2009, 89 patients with primary carcinomas of the oral cavity, larynx, oropharynx, hypopharynx, and nasopharynx received definitive IMRT with or without concurrent chemotherapy. Twenty patients were treated using the MHF schedule, while 69 patients were treated with the CDF schedule. Patient characteristics and dosimetry plans were reviewed. Patterns of failure including local recurrence (LR), regional recurrence (RR), distant metastasis (DM), disease-free survival (DFS), overall survival (OS), and toxicities, including rate of feeding tube placement and percentage of weight loss, were reviewed and analyzed. Result(s): Median follow-up was 31.2 months. Thirty-five percent of patients in the MHF cohort and 77% of patients in the CDF cohort received chemotherapy. No RR was observed in either cohort. OS, DFS, LR, and DM rates for the entire group at 2 years were 89.3%, 81.4%, 7.1%, and 9.4%, respectively. Subgroup analysis showed no significant differences in OS (p = 0.595), DFS (p = 0.863), LR (p = 0.833), or DM (p = 0.917) between these two cohorts. Similarly, no significant differences were observed in rates of feeding tube placement and percentages of weight loss. Conclusion(s): Similar treatment outcomes were observed for MHF and CDF cohorts.

Suckling young of opossums (Monodelphis domestica) were exposed to ultraviolet radiation (UVR, predominantly UVB: 290-320 nm) in part to determine an optimal protocol for induction and progression of melanoma in this species. In all, 620 litters were introduced to one of seven protocols. The lowest dose (175 J/m2) administered three times a week for almost three weeks led to the highest incidence of melanotic lesions with melanoma potential (8.1%) among young (5-month-old) adults. Among 101 much older animals (> 17 months at necropsy), 43% showed metastatic melanoma to the lymph nodes and almost one-third of these had progressed to widespread dissemination. Three of the latter animals, from a total of 13 obtained so far, were selected for detailed histological examination of disseminated disease. At necropsy, all three showed widespread metastases beyond the lymph nodes to the spleen, lungs, and other distant sites. Histological changes typical of malignant melanoma included junctional activity, mitotic figures, and nerve and vessel invasion. This novel finding leads us to conclude that UVR can act as a complete carcinogen for progression to widely disseminated disease and that exposure of sucklings can lead, in old age, to widespread metastatic melanoma in this model. The results are thus not inconsistent with the view that, in humans, early exposure to sunlight might act as an initiating factor in a later progression to malignant melanoma.",Excluded
2298,"Evaluation of the reticulocyte micronucleus assay in patients treated with radioiodine for thyroid cancer. In the case of accidental radiation exposure, biological dosimetry has an important role. Previous studies have indicated that the flow cytometric micronucleus (MN) assay in human transferrin receptor positive reticulocytes (Tf-Ret) in blood could be a sensitive biomarker for chromosome damage. In the present investigation, the utility and sensitivity of this method was studied in 44 young patients from Belarus, who were treated with 131I for thyroid cancer. Red marrow (RM) is the critical organ in radioiodine therapy (RIT). In our patients, it was exposed to 100-700 mSv low-dose rate irradiation within 2-4 days. About 3 days after 131I administration, the frequency of micronucleated-Tf-Ret (f(MN-Tf-Ret)) increases within 1 day to a maximum and declines in the following 2-5 days to its value before treatment. A total dose of 100 mSv was easily detectable. The sensitivity of the assay after acute irradiation may be 50 mSv. The method should be useful for monitoring individuals after a radiation accident, provided blood samples can be obtained within a few days after exposure. The time-course of f(MN-Tf-Ret) is interpreted using a model, which considers the exponential exposure of red marrow in RIT as well as the kinetics of erythroblast maturation and reticulocyte migration into the peripheral circulation. Similar modelling was done on published data of MN in immature mouse erythrocytes. Striking similarities in the kinetic and in the yield of MN-induction were found between these two species. This lends support for the use of the mouse as a model for the MN-induction in humans.",Excluded
198,"Diagnostic performance of CT-guided percutaneous transthoracic core needle biopsy using low tube voltage (100 kVp): comparison with conventional tube voltage (120 kVp). Background: Computed tomography (CT)-guided percutaneous transthoracic core needle biopsy (PTNB) is typically performed at 120 kVp tube voltage. However, there is no study that has demonstrated diagnostic performance including ground-glass nodules and radiation dose reduction at lower tube voltage in large population. Purpose(s): To retrospectively compare the diagnostic performance and radiation dose between 100 kVp and 120 kVp during CT-guided PTNB. Material(s) and Method(s): This study included 393 PTNBs performed in 385 patients (Group I; 120 kVp) from March 2011 to September 2011 and 1368 PTNBs performed in 1318 patients (Group II; 100 kVp) from October 2011 to December 2013. The patients underwent CT-guided PTNB with the coaxial technique. Diagnostic performance, complication rate, and radiation dose were compared between two groups. Result(s): Technical success was achieved in 391 of 393 PTNBs (99.5%) in Group I and in 1344 of 1368 PTNBs (98.2%) in Group II (P = 0.09). The diagnostic accuracies for pulmonary lesions were not significantly different between two groups (97.1% [362/373] versus 96.2% [1202/1249], P = 0.458). Complication rate showed no significant differences between two groups in terms of pneumothorax (19.7% [77/391] versus 19.4% [261/1344], P = 0.904) and hemoptysis (2.3% [9/391] versus 3.2% [43/1344], P = 0.360). Among patients who developed pneumothorax, three patients (3.9%, 3/77) in Group I and eight patients (3.1%, 8/261) in Group II required treatment with drainage catheter. Nobody needed further treatment for hemoptysis in the two groups. The mean radiation dose was 1.5 +/- 1.9 mSv in Group I and 0.7 +/- 0.3 mSv in Group II (P < 0.001). Conclusion(s): The 100-kVp protocol for CT-guided PTNB showed significant benefit of radiation dose reduction while maintaining high diagnostic accuracy and safety.Copyright © 2017, © The Foundation Acta Radiologica 2017.",Excluded
1375,"Definition of an optimal model based on segments' contribution for the estimation of the acceleration of the center of mass in people with lower-limb amputation. Introduction In the context of rehabilitation of people with amputation, gait analysis provides information about gait alterations. In that perspective, the body center of mass (BCoM) trajectory, or its derivatives, can be used to describe how the whole body moves (Cavagna and Kaneko 1977). It is generally obtained using force plates or an optical motion capture system (OMC). However, these instruments are constrained to laboratory use. Magneto-Inertial measurement units (MIMUs) are wearable sensors that allow BCoM kinematics assessment in every-day life conditions (Pavei et al. 2020): first, the BCoM acceleration can be obtained from a weighted average of segments' center of mass (sCoM) accelerations, using MIMUs located on the segments, and then, the BCoM trajectory is estimated by integration of the obtained acceleration. Finding a balance between a limited number of sensors and good accuracy is crucial. In this respect, Shahabpoor et al. (2018) recently proposed a method to select a reduced number of MIMUs for the estimation of the 3D BCoM acceleration. However, the methodology was not applied in people with lower-limb amputation. This study aims at filling this gap. First, the most appropriate segments to include in the model are identified, then the accuracy of models based on different combinations of these segments was assessed using OMC data. 2. Methods 2.1. Experimental method The study was approved by the local ethical committee and 8 transfemoral amputees (6 males, 2 females, age: 40.8 +/- 12.6 years, mass: 70.8 +/- 17.5 kg) gave their written informed consent to participate in the study. According to the methodology reported in Al Abiad et al. (2020), the 3D trajectory of 59 reflective markers located on patients' anatomical landmarks were acquired with OMC during walking, and combined with static EOS-based biplanar x-rays acquisition. 2.2. Data processing A 15-segments hybrid inertial model constructed according to Al Abiad et al. (2020), was used to obtain sCoM inertial parameters. sCoM accelerations were obtained from OMC, and reference BCoM acceleration was obtained using the abovementioned inertial model. The contribution of each segment in the BCoM acceleration was defined as the acceleration of the sCoM, weighted by the relative mass of the segment in the body (1) Then, for each subject, Pearson's cross-correlations of sCoM accelerations were computed for each pair of segments and between each sCoM and BCoM accelerations over a complete gait cycle, for the anteroposterior (AP), mediolateral (ML) and vertical (V) directions. For each direction, the cross-correlation matrices were averaged over all subjects. These steps allowed to define the most relevant contributing segments to the BCoM acceleration to construct a MIMUs-based experimental model with a minimal number of segments (MiNuM model). The mass of the non-selected segments was attributed to the main contributors based on sCoM accelerations cross-correlations (Shahabpoor et al. 2018). MiNuM models were validated against the reference BCoM using a leave-one-out methodology. Reference and MiNuM-based BCoM accelerations were compared over the central prosthetic gait cycle of each trial using Pearson's correlation coefficients and peak-to-peak normalized root-mean square errors (NRMSE), averaged over all patients. 3. Results and discussion A total of 22 gait cycles were analysed for the 8 participants. Trunk, pelvis, both thighs and both feet were considered as the best sensor locations to be considered (Figure 1). Finally, different MiNuM models were built (see 'Segment included' column in Table 1). Leave-one-out validation results are summarized in Table 1. The optimal MiNuM model for transfemoral amputees is based on 5 segments, i.e., trunk, both thighs and both feet. Indeed, it presented results similar to improved compared to those presented in Shahabpoor et al. (2018) in healthy subjects using the 3-sensor configuration (16%, 7%, 18% in AP, V, ML respectively) and provided a good compromise between accuracy and reduced number of sensors. 4. Conclusions This study allowed to obtain insight on the best location of sensors for 3D BCoM acceleration estimation in people with transfemoral amputation. It is worth to underline that the achieved results rely on the localization of sCoM using EOS imaging and were obtained using acceleration data derived from OMC markers. When using MIMUs, one may be confronted with additional sources of errors such as softtissue artefacts that could affect the obtained results. Therefore, the accuracy obtained using actual MIMUs as well as methodologies to correctly identify MIMU positions relative to the sCoM represent research tracks of interest.",Excluded

486,"Fractures of the sacrum after chemoradiation for rectal carcinoma: Incidence, risk factors, and radiographic evaluation. Purpose: Sacral insufficiency fractures after adjuvant radiation for rectal carcinoma can present similarly to recurrent disease. As a complication associated with pelvic radiation, it is important to be aware of the incidence and risk factors associated with sacral fractures in the clinical assessment of these patients. Methods and Materials: Between 1998 and 2007, a total of 582 patients with locally advanced rectal carcinoma received adjuvant chemoradiation and surgical excision. Of these, 492 patients had imaging studies available for review. Hospital records and imaging studies from all 492 patients were retrospectively evaluated to identify risk factors associated with developing a sacral insufficiency fracture. Result(s): With a median follow-up time of 3.5 years, the incidence of sacral fractures was 7.1% (35/492). The 4-year sacral fracture free rate was 0.91. Univariate analysis showed that increasing age (>=60 vs. <60 years), female sex, and history of osteoporosis were significantly associated with shorter time to sacral fracture (P=.01, P=.004, P=.001, respectively). There was no significant difference in the time to sacral fracture for patients based on stage, radiotherapy dose, or chemotherapy regimen. Multivariate analysis showed increasing age (>=60 vs. <60 years, hazard ratio [HR] = 2.50, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.22-5.13, P=.01), female sex (HR = 2.64, CI = 1.29-5.38, P=.008), and history of osteoporosis (HR = 3.23, CI = 1.23-8.50, P=.02) were independent risk factors associated with sacral fracture. Conclusion(s): Sacral insufficiency fractures after pelvic radiation for rectal carcinoma occur more commonly than previously described. Independent risk factors associated with fracture were osteoporosis, female sex, and age greater than 60 years. © 2012 Elsevier Inc.",Excluded
516,"Correlation of physical exam findings with fever in patients with skin and soft tissue infections. Introduction: The objectives of this study were to determine the prevalence of fever in adult ED patients with skin and soft tissue infections (SSTI) and to determine which, if any, physical exam, radiograph and laboratory test findings were associated with fever. Method(s): We conducted a prospective, observational study at an urban county trauma center of adults who presented to the ED for evaluation of suspected SSTI. ED providers measured area of erythema and induration using a tape measure, and completed data sheets indicating comorbid conditions and the presence or absence of physical exam findings. Fever was defined as any recorded temperature > 38degreeC during the first six hours of ED evaluation. Result(s): Of the 734 patients enrolled, 96 (13.1%) had fever. Physical and laboratory exam findings associated with the presence of a fever in multivariable logistic regression were the area of erythema, particularly the largest quartile of area of erythema, 144-5,000 cm2, (odd ratio [OR] = 2.9; 95% confidence interval [CI] [1.6-5.2]) and leukocytosis (OR = 4.4, 95% CI [2.7-7.0]). Bullae, necrosis, streaks, adenopathy, and bone involvement on imaging were not associated with fever. Conclusion(s): Fever is uncommon in patients presenting to the ED for evaluation of suspected SSTI. Area of erythema and leukocytosis were associated with fever and should be considered in future decision rules for the evaluation and treatment of SSTI.Copyright © 2017 Mongelluzzo et al.",Excluded

Study Design.Retrospective study of postoperative outcomes of adult spinal deformity (ASD) surgery.Objective.To clarify the differences in postoperative outcomes depending on the presence or absence of thoracic compensatory changes among patients with a T1 slope (TS) more than 40degree.Summary of Background Data.Loss correction after ASD surgery is more likely to occur when preoperative TS is more than 40degree. When preoperative TS is more than 40degree, some cases involve compensatory changes in the thoracic spine and decreased thoracic kyphosis (TK); others involve increased TK without compensatory changes.Methods.Seventy-nine patients with TS more than 40degree who underwent ASD surgery were enrolled and separated into compensated and noncompensated groups (group C: TK <40degree; group NC: TK >=40degree). Radiographic parameters obtained by whole-spine standing x-ray, the Oswestry Disability Index (ODI), and Scoliosis Research Society-22 (SRS-22) questionnaire were assessed.Results.There were 41 patients in group C and 38 patients in group NC. Preoperative significant differences in TS did not disappear after surgery (preoperative TS: group C and group NC=46degree and 55degree, P<0.001; just after surgery: group C and group NC=27degree and 40degree, P<0.001; 2 years later: group C and group NC=34degree and 47degree, P<0.001). There were no significant differences in ODI and all domains of the SRS-22 before surgery. However, 2 years after the surgery, ODI (38%), pain (3.5), self-image (3.0), and total (3.2) values of the SRS-22 for group NC were significantly worse than those (28%, 4.0, 3.4, and 3.5, respectively) for group C (P<0.05).Conclusion.Changes in the thoracic spine (TS and TK >40degree) result in poor postoperative outcomes. Extending the upper instrumented vertebra (UIV) to the upper thoracic spine must be considered. Even when TS is more than 40degree, TK less than 40degree, and upper instrumented vertebra set to the lower thoracic level result in good postoperative outcomes.

PURPOSE: To identify the dose-volumetric parameters associated with the risk of radiation-induced hepatic toxicity (RIHT) in hepatocellular carcinoma patients treated with three-dimensional conformal radiotherapy., METHODS AND MATERIALS: A total of 105 hepatocellular carcinoma patients underwent three-dimensional conformal radiotherapy (total dose range, 44-58.5 Gy; median, 54). RIHT was scored within 4 months of completing three-dimensional conformal radiotherapy. The dose-volume parameters analyzed were the gross tumor volume; normal liver volume; total liver volume; radiation dose; mean dose to the normal liver; percentage of the normal liver volume receiving > or =20, > or =25, > or =30, > or =35, and > or =40 Gy; percentage of the total liver volume receiving > or =20, > or =25, > or =30, > or =35, and > or =40 Gy; and the normal tissue complication probability., RESULTS: Of the 105 patients, Grade 1 RIHT was observed in 21 (20.0%), Grade 2 in 7 (6.7%), Grade 3 in 5 (4.8%), and Grade 4 in 1 (1.0%) patient. No fatal Grade 5 RIHT developed. On multivariate analysis for predicting Grade 2 or worse RIHT, the total liver volume receiving > or =30 Gy was the only significant parameter (p < 0.001). Grade 2 or worse RIHT was observed in only 2 (2.4%) of 85 patients with a total liver volume receiving 30 Gy of 60% (p < 0.001)., CONCLUSION: The total liver volume receiving > or =30 Gy appears to be a useful dose-volumetric parameter for predicting the risk of RIHT. This volume should be limited to < or =60% whenever possible to minimize the risk of Grade 2 or worse RIHT.",Excluded
1950,"Mechanisms for discomfort glare in central vision. PURPOSE: The presence of a bright light source in the visual field can generate visual discomfort. Based on empirical observations we can predict to a reasonable degree of accuracy how uncomfortable a given lighting installation is likely to be; yet very little is known about the mechanism or physiological underpinnings that lead to visual discomfort. This study attempts to elucidate some of the underlying mechanisms by controlling the amount of light reaching the retina and by varying photometric properties of the glare source., METHODS: The participants were required to view a source of light presented against a simulated residential street background in the form of uniform flashes of light of varying intensity. Discomfort-glare thresholds were estimated using a staircase procedure; the dependent variable was retinal illuminance. The size of the glare source and the luminance of the surrounding background were varied systematically., RESULTS: Across glare-source sizes or background luminances the discomfort-glare threshold varied less in terms of retinal illuminance than it did in terms of pupil-plane illuminance or light flux. A two-stage model based on saturation of photoreceptors followed by summation of an edge response signal that defines the edges of the glare-source accurately predicted the data., CONCLUSIONS: Discomfort glare in central vision is more closely associated with the spatial properties of the glare source, such as contrast-defined edges, than the overall amount of light entering the eye. The results suggest that discomfort glare in lighting installations could be reduced while maintaining adequate illuminance levels by an appropriate choice of illuminant source size.

3211,"Prospective assessment of gustatory function after radiotherapy for head and neck cancers. Background: Taste disorders are major causes of morbidity in patients undergoing head and neck irradiation. We quantitatively assessed the gustatory function of patients with head and neck cancers who underwent radiotherapy using recently developed standardised tools for measuring taste. Method(s): Twenty patients undergoing head and neck irradiation responded to a specific questionnaire and were assessed by olfactory and gustatory function tests. To assess changes over time, testing was performed before, immediately after, and at 2- and 4-week intervals following the start of radiotherapy. Concurrently, patients were evaluated for xerostomia from radiotherapy. Result(s): A decrease in the taste recognition threshold was observed in the second week after the beginning of radiotherapy. The taste detection threshold improved within the 14th-18th week. Most affected patients demonstrated that their gustatory function primarily decreased independent of the olfactory function. Disturbances in taste were exponentially worsened beyond an accumulated dose of 30 Gy and involved all tastants. According to a multivariate analysis, radiation-induced taste impairment was not influenced by the degree of xerostomia. However, there was an association between the dose of irradiation and the severity of taste disturbance. Conclusion(s): In this preliminary study, we found that the taste function was worse 2 weeks after the start of radiotherapy and returned to pretreatment levels within 4.5 months. Taste disturbances were exponentially worse beyond an accumulated dose of 20 Gy. Taste dysfunction after radiotherapy was not influenced by the degree of xerostomia, whereas only the dose of irradiation was associated with the severity of taste dysfunction.Copyright © 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.",Excluded

The results suggest that either an emigrant wave, or waves, of modern humans emerged from Africa and with time segregated into at least three groups: Australian aborigines, Europeans, and Southeast Asians, or less likely due to genetic and archaeologic observations, a southern Asia origin of all modem humans from an emigrant African hominid.

Objectives: To assess radiation dose and image quality using Adaptive Statistical Iterative Reconstruction (ASIR) in craniocervical computed tomographic angiography and to further evaluate the impact of body mass index (BMI) on image quality. Method(s): A total of 178 consecutive patients (112 men, 66 women; age range, 25-79 years) were enrolled in this prospective study and randomly divided into 2 groups: group A (conventional group): 120 kV, filtered back-projection reconstruction, and group B (low-dose group): 100 kV, 40% ASIR reconstruction. Radiation dose and image quality between groups A and B were compared. Correlation coefficients were calculated between quantitative image quality measurement and BMI, and between radiation dose and BMI using Pearson correlation. Two experienced radiologists independently evaluated the image quality with 4-point scores, and interrater reliability was calculated using kappa analysis. Result(s): The volume CT dose index, dose-length product, and effective dose of group B were lower than those of group A (each P < 0.01), with decreases of 23.99%, 25.15% and 25.47% respectively. Positive correlations existed between radiation dose and BMI for both groups A and B (each P < 0.01). GroupB had lower image noise, higher attenuation, higher signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR), and higher subjective score than did group A (each P < 0.01). Computed tomographic values had negative correlations with BMI for the head, neck, and shoulders in both groups A and B (each P < 0.01). Image noise, SNR, and CNR had no correlations with BMI for the head and neck in both groups (each P > 0.01). On the contrary, image noise had a positive correlation, and SNR and CNR had a negative correlations with BMI for the shoulders in group A (each P < 0.01), but in contrast, no such correlations were found in group B (each P > 0.01). Conclusion(s): In craniocervical CTA, ASIR can improve the image quality and reduce radiation dose in patients.

Method(s): Patients who completed definitive radiotherapy (RT) for oropharyngeal cancer and had blood counts taken pre-RT from 2002 to 2013 were included. NLR was calculated as total neutrophil/lymphocytes. Survival rates were estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method. Univariable and multivariable analyses were conducted with linear and Cox regression methods. NLR was analysed posteriori and dichotomised on the discovered median. Result(s): Eight hundred and forty-eight patients were analysed. The median pre-RT NLR was 3. Patients with NLR of <3 had improved overall survival (OS) than those with NLR >= 3 (5-year OS 85 vs 74%, p < 0.0001). OS differences remained significant when stratified according to HPV status (HPV-positive p = 0.011; HPV-negative p = 0.003). Freedom from any recurrence (FFR), locoregional control (LRC) and freedom of distant recurrence (FDR) were better in those with NLR < 3. The negative impact of elevated pre-RT NLR on OS (HR = 1.64, p = 0.001), FFR (HR = 1.6, p = 0.006) and LRC (HR = 1.8, p = 0.005) remained significant on multivariable analysis.

3556,"Novel mutation in keratin 10 causing autosomal dominant epidermolytic ichthyosis. Epidermolytic ichthyosis (EI; OMIM 113800), previously termed bullous congenital ichthyosiform erythroderma or epidermolytic hyperkeratosis, is a clinically heterogeneous disorder of keratinization caused by mutations in either of the KRT1 or KRT10 genes, which encode the suprabasal keratins K1 and K10, respectively. The condition is usually characterized clinically by severe neonatal erythroderma, blistering and fragile skin, with the subsequent development of generalized hyperkeratosis. Usually mutations are missense substitutions in the highly conserved alpha-helical rod domains of these keratins, which play a critical role in filament formation. The presence of palmoplantar keratoderma is suggestive of KRT1 mutations, whereas KRT10 mutations are associated with palmoplantar sparing. We report a seven-generation kindred with EI due to a novel mutation in KRT10. A 32-year-old woman presented with widespread ichthyosis and erythema affecting her trunk and limbs. She gave a history of scaling and erythroderma since birth but no blistering, erosions or collodion membrane. She had been maintained on oral isotretinoin 20-40 mg once daily from the age of 13 years, but had recently developed lower-back and hip pain. Examination revealed widespread fine scaling and erythema over the trunk and limbs with more significant hyperkeratosis at the elbows, knees and ankles. There was relative sparing of the palmoplantar skin. Her father, uncle and grandmother were more severely affected, but none was receiving oral retinoids. Four further generations were recorded as affected. Histology of affected elbow and upper-arm skin demonstrated acanthosis, marked overlying hyperkeratosis, vacuolar change of the upper epidermal cells in the upper epidermis with prominent clumping of keratohyaline granules and abnormal eosinophilic cytoplasm. X-rays of the lower lumbar spine and left hip demonstrated bridging osteophytes T11-L1 and flattening of the left femoral head, with magnetic resonance imaging confirming the presence of avascular necrosis. This required treatment with a left core decompression of the left hip, with good results. Mutation screening of KRT10 identified a novel heterozygous deletion extending from intron 5 into exon 6 (designated K10 c.1156-79- 1243del), abolishing the exon 6 acceptor splice site, resulting in a shorter aberrant K10 protein lacking a sequence motif critically important for keratin filament assembly. The mutation was present in her affected father. This finding adds to the evidence that K10 mutations are the principal cause of autosomal dominant EI with palmoplantar sparing. It also highlights the possible side-effects of long-term oral retinoid treatment in these inherited conditions.",Excluded
412,"Intraoperative electron radiation therapy as an important treatment modality in retroperitoneal sarcoma. Background: Local recurrence (LR) rates in patients with retroperitoneal sarcoma (RPS) are high, ranging from 40% to 80%, with no definitive studies describing the best way to administer radiation. Intraoperative electron beam radiation therapy (IOERT) provides a theoretical advantage for access to the tumor bed with reduced toxicity to surrounding structures. The goal of this study was to evaluate the role of IOERT in high-risk patients. Method(s): An institutional review board approved, single institution sarcoma database was queried to identify patients who received IOERT for treatment of RPS from 2/2001 to 1/2009. Data were analyzed using the Kaplan-Meier method, Cox regression, and Fisher Exact tests. Result(s): Eighteen patients (median age 51 y, 25-76 y) underwent tumor resection with IOERT (median dose 1250 cGy) for primary (n = 13) and recurrent (n = 5) RPS. Seventeen patients received neoadjuvant radiotherapy. Eight high-grade and 10 low-grade tumors were identified. Median tumor size was 15 cm. Four patients died and two in the perioperative period. Median follow-up of survivors was 3.6 y. Five patients (31%) developed an LR in the irradiated field. Three patients with primary disease (25%) and two (50%) with recurrent disease developed an LR (P = 0.5). Four patients with high-grade tumors (57%) and one with a low-grade tumor (11%) developed an LR (P = 0.1). The 2- and 5-y OS rates were 100% and 72%. Two- and 5-y LR rates were 13% and 36%. Conclusion(s): Using a multidisciplinary approach, we have achieved low LR rates in our high-risk patient population indicating that IOERT may play an important role in managing these patients. © 2013 Elsevier Inc.

1492,"Radioiodide (131I) therapy for the treatment of canine thyroid carcinoma. OBJECTIVE: To assess the efficacy of radioactive iodine treatment (131I) for canine thyroid carcinoma, as both the sole therapeutic modality and as an adjunct to surgery. DESIGN: Retrospective analysis of case records from the Gladesville Veterinary Hospital Nuclear Medicine Service, Sydney, between August 1988 and December 2001. CASE DETAILS: The records of 65 dogs with thyroid carcinoma were analysed according to therapy and outcome. Forty-three dogs received radioiodide therapy, either as the sole therapeutic modality (32) or as an adjunct to surgery (11). Radioisotope therapy consisted of one to three doses of 131I with a dose range of 555 to 1850 MBq. For analysis, dogs were divided into groups according to therapy: no treatment, surgery alone, surgery with radioiodide therapy or radioiodide therapy alone. Mode of therapy, dosage of 131I, clinical staging and age were all independently analysed according to survival to compare efficacy or predictive value respectively. RESULT(S): When radioiodide therapy was used as an adjunct to surgery, median survival was 34 months. Censored median survival time for dogs that received radioiodide alone was 30 months. Dogs that did not receive treatment had a median survival of only 3 months. Log rank statistical analysis indicated that mode of therapy was significantly correlated with survival but that clinical stage of disease was not. CONCLUSION(S): The authors conclude that 131I therapy is effective at extending survival time, both as a sole therapeutic modality and as an adjunct to surgery, in dogs with invasive canine thyroid carcinoma. Incomplete surgical resection may not prolong survival in dogs also receiving 131I therapy, however surgical resection with curative intent should be recommended as the first line of therapy for mobile thyroid carcinomas. Radioisotope therapy can be recommended for cases where surgery alone is considered unlikely to be curative because of metastatic disease or local invasion, or for cases where surgery has been attempted but complete surgical removal has not been achieved.",Excluded
3638,"The effects of radioactive iodine therapy on olfactory function. PURPOSE: To determine the possible adverse effects of radioactive iodine (RAI) treatment on the olfactory functions of patients with differentiated thyroid carcinoma., MATERIALS AND METHODS: This prospective clinical study included 63 Turkish patients who had been diagnosed with papillary thyroid carcinoma only to ensure homogeneity. The Connecticut Chemosensory Clinical Research Center olfactory test was administered at 1 week before treatment and at the third week and the first year after treatment. Triiodothyronine, thyroxine, thyroid stimulating hormone, thyroglobulin, and antithyroglobulin levels were measured 1 week before treatment and 2 weeks after treatment., RESULTS: The smell threshold test, smell identification test, and total smell scores showed statistically significant decreases after treatment when compared with the pretreatment scores (p = 0.000). No significant differences were noted between the late term and early term after RAI for either the identification score (p = 0.502) or the total score (p = 0.051). The Spearman correlation analysis indicated a significant correlation between age and RAI before and after treatment for the smell threshold test, smell identification test, and total smell scores (p < 0.05). A total of 54% of the patients displayed normosmia in the posttreatment period. A few patients had mild hyposmia before RAI, 27% had mild hyposmia in the early stage after RAI, and 29% had mild hyposmia in the late stage., CONCLUSION: The olfactory function deteriorated in almost half of the patients in the early stage after RAI. Mild and moderate hyposmia in particular occurred in the first year after RAI.",Excluded

Purpose/Objective(s): Stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) is a rapidly prevailing treatment modality suggesting high effectiveness in the treatment of medically inoperable stage I non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). It has also been applied in operable stage I NSCLC patients, but the prospective data have not been available yet. The purpose of JCOG0403 was to evaluate the safety and efficacy of SBRT in patients with both operable and medically inoperable T1N0M0 NSCLC (UICC 6th ed., 2002), and this is the first report analyzed for operable population. Materials/Methods: The eligibility criteria included histologically or cytologically proven NSCLC, clinical T1N0M0, operable patients assessed by thoracic surgeons, PS 0-2, >= 20 years old, PaO2 >= 60 torr, FEV1.0>= 700 mL, and written informed consent. The prescription was 48 Gy at the isocenter in 4 fractions over 4-8 days. 4-10 MV X rays were allowed. Heterogeneity corrected doses by pencil beam algorithms were used. The GTV included the primary tumor only, CTV margin was not considered, and ITV margin and 5 mm setup margin were added. As a quality assurance program, credentialing of institutions and an individual case review using the Image-guided Therapy Center (ITC) remote review tool were performed. The primary endpoint was the three-year overall survival. The secondary endpoints included overall survival (OS), progression-free survival (PFS), local-progression free survival (LPFS), event-free survival (EFS), toxicity, and patterns of failure. The sample size was determined so that the 95% confidence interval for the estimated 3-year OS would be +/- 10% around expected value of 80%. Result(s): Between July 2004 and January 2007, 65 patientswere registered in this study from15 institutions.The patients characteristics were:male 45, female 20; median age 79 (range, 50-91);median tumor size 21mm(range, 10-30mm); adenocarcinomas 40, squamous cell carcinomas 21, others 4; and PS 0/1/2, 43/20/2. All patients completed the protocol treatment. At the last follow-up in November 2009, median follow-up of censored cases was 45.4 months. of the eligible 64 patients, the 3-year overall survival was 76.0% (95% CI: 63.3% - 84.8%). To date, a total of 25 progressions were observed, and the 3-year PFS, LPFS, and EFS were 54.5% (95% CI: 41.5% - 65.7%), 68.5% (95% CI: 55.5% -78.4%) and 51.4% (95% CI: 38.6% - 62.9%), respectively. Grade 3 toxicity was observed in chest pain 1 (1.5%), dyspnea 2 (3.1%), hypoxia 1 (1.5%), and pneumonitis 2 (3.1%). No grade 4 and 5 toxicity was observed.

No trend was found toward more frequent testing after adjustment for patient characteristics, risk factors, and provider characteristics (P-0.134). Cardiac stress tests with imaging comprised a growing portion of all tests, increasing from 59% in 1993 to 1995 to 87% in 2008 to 2010.

The purpose of this study is to determine the efficacy of gamma knife radiosurgery (GKS) treatment of pituitary adenomas that have invaded the cavernous sinus. Methods. Sixteen patients were treated with GKS: three with nonfunctional adenomas and 13 with hormone-secreting (seven growth hormone [GH] and six adrenocorticotropic hormone [ACTH]) adenomas. More than 16 Gy and 30 Gy were delivered to the tumor margin for nonfunctioning tumors and functioning tumors, respectively, keeping the dose to the optic pathways below 10 Gy.

968,"Radiosensitizing effects of miR-18a-5p on lung cancer stem-like cells via downregulating both ATM and HIF-1alpha. Lung cancer is one of the main causes of cancer mortality globally. Most patients received radiotherapy during the course of disease. However, radioresistance generally occurs in the majority of these patients, leading to poor curative effect, and the underlying mechanism remains unclear. In the present study, miR-18a-5p expression was downregulated in irradiated lung cancer cells. Overexpression of miR-18a-5p increased the radiosensitivity of lung cancer cells and inhibited the growth of A549 xenografts after radiation exposure. Dual luciferase report system and miR-18a-5p overexpression identified ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM) and hypoxia inducible factor 1 alpha (HIF-1alpha) as the targets of miR-18a-5p. The mRNA and protein expressions of ATM and HIF-1alpha were dramatically downregulated by miR-18a-5p in vitro and in vivo. Clinically, plasma miR-18a-5p expression was significantly higher in radiosensitive than in radioresistant group (P < .001). The cutoff value of miR-18a-5p >2.28 was obtained from receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve. The objective response rate (ORR) was significantly higher in miR-18a-5p-high group than in miR-18a-5p-low group (P < .001). A tendency demonstrated that the median local progression-free survival (PFS) from radiotherapy was longer in miR-18a-5p-high than in miR-18a-5p-low group (P = .082). The median overall survival (OS) from radiotherapy was numerically longer in miR-18a-5p-high than in miR-18a-5p-low group (P = .281). The sensitivity and specificity of plasma miR-18a-5p to predict radiosensitivity was 87% and 95%, respectively. Collectively, these results indicate that miR-18a-5p increases the radiosensitivity in lung cancer cells and CD133+ stem-like cells via downregulating ATM and HIF-1alpha expressions. Plasma miR-18a-5p would be an available indicator of radiosensitivity in lung cancer patients. Copyright © 2018 The Authors. Cancer Medicine published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",Excluded

The aim of this study was to determine diagnostic reference levels (DRLs) for cardiac computed tomography (CCT) in Jordan. Volume computed tomography dose index (CTDIvol ) and dose-length product (DLP) were collected from 228 CCTs performed at seven Jordanian hospitals specialized in cardiac CT. DRLs for cardiac CT were defined at the 75th percentile of CTDIvol and DLP. CTDIvol and DLP were collected from 30 successive cardiac CT in each center except for one center (18 scans). The 75th percentile of the CTDIvol and the DLP of the centers calculated from mixed retrospective and prospective gated modes were 47.74 milligray (mGy) and 1035 mGy/cm, respectively. This study demonstrated wide dose variations among the surveyed hospitals for cardiac CT scans; there was a 5.1-fold difference between the highest and lowest median DLP with a range of 223.2-1146.7 mGy/cm. Differences were associated with variations in the mAs and kVp. This study confirmed large variability in CTDIvol and DLP for cardiac CT scans; variation was associated with acquisition protocols and highlights the need for dose optimization. DRLs are proposed for CCT; there remains substantial potential for optimization of cardiac CT examinations for adults in Jordan.Copyright © 2019 The Authors.

The pharmacokinetics and dosimetry of (86)Y-DOTA(0)- d-Phe(1)-Tyr(3)-octreotide ((86)Y-SMT487) were evaluated in a phase I positron emission tomography (PET) study of 24 patients with somatostatin receptor-positive neuroendocrine tumours. The effect of amino acid (AA) co-infusion on renal and tumour uptake was assessed in a cross-over randomised setting. Five regimens were tested: no infusion, 4-h infusion of 120 g mixed AA (26.4 g l-lysine + l-arginine), 4 h l-lysine (50 g), 10 h 240 g mixed AA (52.8 g l-lysine + l-arginine) and 4 h Lys-Arg (25 g each). Comparisons were performed on an intra-patient basis. Infusions of AA started 0.5 h prior to injection of (86)Y-SMT487 and PET scans were obtained at 4, 24 and 48 h p.i. Absorbed doses to tissues were computed using the MIRD3 method. (86)Y-SMT487 displayed rapid plasma clearance and exclusive renal excretion; uptake was noted in kidneys, tumours, spleen and, to a lesser extent, liver. The 4-h mixed AA co-infusion significantly ( P<0.05) reduced (86)Y-SMT487 renal uptake by a mean of 21%. This protective effect was significant on the dosimetry data (3.3+/-1.3 vs 4.4+/-1.0 mGy/MBq; P<0.05) and was further enhanced upon prolonging the infusion to 10 h (2.1+/-0.4 vs 1.7+/-0.2 mGy/MBq; P<0.05). Infusion of Lys-Arg but not of l-lysine was more effective in reducing renal uptake than mixed AA. Infusion of AA did not result in reduced tumour uptake. The amount of (90)Y-SMT487 (maximum allowed dose: MAD) that would result in a 23-Gy cut-off dose to kidneys was calculated for each study: MAD was higher with mixed AA co-infusion by a mean of 46% (10-114%, P<0.05 vs no infusion). In comparison with 4 h mixed AA, the MAD was higher by a mean of 23% (9-37%; P<0.05) with prolonged infusion and by a mean of 16% (2-28%; P<0.05) with Lys-Arg. We conclude that infusion of large amounts of AA reduces renal exposure during peptide-based radiotherapy and allows higher absorbed doses to tumours. The prolongation of the infusion from 4 to 10 h further enhances the protective effect on the kidneys.",Excluded
2349,"Reduction of operator radiation dose by a pelvic lead shield during cardiac catheterization by radial access: Comparison with femoral access. Objectives: This study sought to determine the efficacy of patient pelvic lead shielding for the reduction of operator radiation exposure during cardiac catheterization via the radial access in comparison with the femoral access. Background(s): Cardiac catheterization via the radial access is associated with significantly increased radiation dose to the patient and the operator. Improvements in radiation protection are needed to minimize this drawback. Pelvic lead shielding has the potential to reduce operator radiation dose. Method(s): We randomly assigned 210 patients undergoing elective coronary angiography by the same operator to a radial and femoral access with and without pelvic lead shielding of the patient. Operator radiation dose was measured by a radiation dosimeter attached to the outside breast pocket of the lead apron. Result(s): For radial access, operator dose decreased from 20.9 +/- 13.8 muSv to 9.0 +/- 5.4 muSv, p < 0.0001 with pelvic lead shielding. For femoral access, it decreased from 15.3 +/- 10.4 muSv to 2.9 +/- 2.7 muSv, p < 0.0001. Pelvic lead shielding significantly decreased the dose-area product-normalized operator dose (operator dose divided by the dose-area product) by the same amount for radial and femoral access (0.94 +/- 0.28 to 0.39 +/- 0.19 muSv x Gy-1 x cm-2 and 0.70 +/- 0.26 to 0.16 +/- 0.13 muSv x Gy-1 x cm-2, respectively). Conclusion(s): Pelvic lead shielding is highly effective in reducing operator radiation exposure for radial as well as femoral procedures. However, despite its use, radial access remains associated with a higher operator radiation dose. © 2012 American College of Cardiology Foundation.",Excluded

PURPOSE: To assess the relationship between fibroblast intrinsic radiosensitivity in vitro and late reactions of normal tissues in patients treated by definitive radiotherapy for variety of tumors., PATIENTS AND METHODS: Ten patients were selected for this study. They were treated by radical radiotherapy for variety of tumors, including non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, prostate, glottic larynx, anal canal, cervix, bladder, thyroid gland, and tonsil pillar. Five patients did not develop any significant late reactions (normally sensitive group, NS). The other five developed late complications in different normal tissues and organs that proved to be fatal in one patient (clinically hyper-sensitive group, HS). Fibroblast cultures were established from punch skin biopsy and radiosensitivity in vitro was measured. The survival fraction at 2 Gy (SF2) was calculated and compared between the two groups., RESULTS: SF2 ranged between 0.10 and 0.38 with a mean of 0.24. The mean SF2 for each of the NS and the HS groups were 0.31 and 0.17, respectively. The non-parametric rank test of Mann-Whitney shows that the difference between the two groups is statistically significant (p = 0.01)., CONCLUSION: This study indicates that the in vitro radiosensitivity of skin fibroblasts is correlated with late complications in different organs and normal tissues following radiotherapy for variety of tumors. It also lends support to the existence of a common genetic component determining the radiosensitivity of cells targeted by the late effects of ionizing radiation.",Excluded

Method(s): Patients with coronary artery disease and clinical indications for percutaneous intervention were enrolled. The coronary intervention was performed with the CorPath 200 robotic system, which consists of a remote interventional cockpit and a bedside disposable cassette that enables the operator to advance, retract, and rotate guidewires and catheters. The primary endpoints were clinical procedural success, defined as <30% residual stenosis at the completion of the robotic-assisted procedure without major adverse cardiovascular events within 30 days, and device technical success, defined as the successful manipulation of the intracoronary devices using the robotic system only. Result(s): A total of 164 patients were enrolled at 9 sites. Percutaneous coronary intervention was completed successfully without conversion to manual operation, and device technical success was achieved in 162 of 164 patients (98.8%). There were no device-related complications. Clinical procedural success was achieved in 160 of 164 patients (97.6%), whereas 4 (2.4%) had periprocedural non-Q-wave myocardial infarctions.

3179,"Clinical outcomes of 130 patients with primary and secondary lung tumors treated with Cyberknife robotic stereotactic body radiotherapy. Authors report clinical outcomes of patients treated with robotic stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) for primary, recurrent and metastatic lung lesions. 130 patients with 160 lesions were treated with Cyberknife SBRT, including T1-3 primary lung cancers (54%), recurrent tumors (22%) and pulmonary metastases (24%). The mean biologically equivalent dose (BED10Gy) was 151 Gy (72-180 Gy). Median prescribed dose for peripheral and central lesions was 3x20 Gy and 3x15 Gy, respectively. Local control (LC), overall survival (OS), and cause-specific survival (CSS) rates, early and late toxicities are reported. Statistical analysis was performed to identify factors influencing local tumor control. Median follow-up time was 21 months. In univariate analysis, higher dose was associated with better LC and a cut-off value was detected at BED10Gy <= 112.5 Gy, resulting in 1-, 2-, and 3-year actuarial LC rates of 93%, vs 73%, 80% vs 61%, and 63% vs 54%, for the high and low dose groups, respectively (p = 0.0061, HR = 0.384). In multivariate analysis, metastatic origin, histological confirmation and larger Planning Target Volume (PTV) were associated with higher risk of local failure. Actuarial OS and CSS rates at 1, 2, and 3 years were 85%, 74% and 62%, and 93%, 89% and 80%, respectively. Acute and late toxicities >= Gr 3 were observed in 3 (2%) and 6 patients (5%), respectively. Our favorable LC and survival rates after robotic SBRT, with low rates of severe toxicities, are coherent with the literature data in this mixed, non-selected study population.Copyright © 2017 Radiol Oncol.",Excluded
430,"DNA double strand breaks but not interstrand crosslinks prevent progress through meiosis in fully grown mouse oocytes. There is some interest in how mammalian oocytes respond to different types of DNA damage because of the increasing expectation of fertility preservation in women undergoing chemotherapy. Double strand breaks (DSBs) induced by ionizing radiation and agents such as neocarzinostatin (NCS), and interstrand crosslinks (ICLs) induced by alkylating agents such as mitomycin C (MMC), are toxic DNA lesions that need to be repaired for cell survival. Here we examined the effects of NCS and MMC treatment on oocytes collected from antral follicles in mice, because potentially such oocytes are readily collected from ovaries and do not need to be in vitro grown to achieve meiotic competency. We found that oocytes were sensitive to NCS, such that this ionizing radiation mimetic blocked meiosis I and caused fragmented DNA. In contrast, MMC had no impact on the completion of either meiosis I or II, even at extremely high doses. However, oocytes treated with MMC did show gamma-H2AX foci and following their in vitro maturation and parthenogenetic activation the development of the subsequent embryos was severely compromised. Addition of MMC to 1-cell embryos caused a similarly poor level of development, demonstrating oocytes have eventual sensitivity to this ICL-inducing agent but this does not occur during their meiotic division. In oocytes, the association of Fanconi Anemia protein, FANCD2, with sites of ICL lesions was not apparent until entry into the embryonic cell cycle. In conclusion, meiotic maturation of oocytes is sensitive to DSBs but not ICLs. The ability of oocytes to tolerate severe ICL damage and yet complete meiosis, means that this type of DNA lesion goes unrepaired in oocytes but impacts on subsequent embryo quality.",Excluded
2839,"Radiosurgical techniques and clinical outcomes of gamma knife radiosurgery for brainstem arteriovenous malformations. OBJECTIVE: Brainstem arteriovenous malformation (AVM) is rare and radiosurgical management is complicated by the sensitivity of the adjacent neurological structures. Complete obliteration of the nidus is not always possible. We describe over 20 years of radiosurgical procedures for brainstem AVMs, focusing on clinical outcomes and radiosurgical techniques., METHODS: Between 1992 and 2011, the authors performed gamma knife radiosurgery (GKRS) in 464 cerebral AVMs. Twenty-nine of the 464 patients (6.3%) reviewed had brainstem AVMs. This series included sixteen males and thirteen females with a mean age of 30.7 years (range : 5-71 years). The symptoms that led to diagnoses were as follows : an altered mentality (5 patients, 17.3%), motor weakness (10 patients, 34.5%), cranial nerve symptoms (3 patients, 10.3%), headache (6 patients, 20.7%), dizziness (3 patients, 10.3%), and seizures (2 patients, 6.9%). Two patients had undergone a previous nidus resection, and three patients had undergone a previous embolization. Twenty-four patients underwent only GKRS. With respect to the nidus type and blood flow, the ratio of compact type to diffuse type and high flow to low flow were 17 : 12 and 16 : 13, respectively. In this series, 24 patients (82.8%) had a prior hemorrhage. The mean target volume was 1.7 cm(3) (range 0.1-11.3 cm(3)). The mean maximal and marginal radiation doses were 38.5 Gy (range 28.6-43.6 Gy) and 23.4 Gy (range 18-27 Gy), and the mean isodose profile was 61.3% (range 50-70%)., RESULTS: Twenty-four patients had brainstem AVMs and were followed for more than 3 years. Obliteration of the AVMs was eventually documented in 17 patients (70.8%) over a mean follow-up period of 77.5 months (range 36-216 months). With respect to nidus type and blood flow, the obliteration rate of compact types (75%) was higher than that of diffuse types (66.7%), and the obliteration rate of low flow AVMs (76.9%) was higher than that of high flow AVMs (63.6%) (p<0.05). Two patients (6.9%) with three hemorrhagic events suffered a hemorrhage during the follow-up period. The annual bleeding rate of AVM after GKRS was 1.95% per year. No adverse radiation effects or delayed cystic formations were found., CONCLUSION: GKRS has an important clinical role in treatment of brainstem AVMs, which carry excessive surgical risks. Angiographic features and radiosurgical techniques using a lower maximal dose with higher isodose profiles are important for lesion obliteration and the avoidance of complications.",Excluded
1963,"Renal involvement in primary Sjogren's syndrome: a prospective cohort study. The objective of the study is to prospectively evaluate the spectrum of clinical and subclinical renal involvement in patients with primary Sjogren's syndrome (pSS). Of the 174 patients screened, seventy patients with pSS underwent renal function tests, urine examination, renal ultrasound, arterial blood gases, urine pH followed by urine acidification test and renal biopsy (if indicated). Renal tubular acidosis (RTA) was treated with alkali replacement and moderate-severe tubulointerstitial nephritis (TIN) was treated with oral prednisolone. Sixty-two patients completed 1-year follow-up. A comparison was made between patients with and without renal involvement. Thirty-five (50%) patients had renal involvement. They had a lower baseline eGFR (71.85 +/- 18.04 vs. 83.8 +/- 17, p = 0.005). Twenty-nine patients had RTA (25 complete and 4 incomplete). Eleven patients had urinary abnormalities. Patients with RTA (n = 29) were younger (34.9 +/- 9 vs. 42 +/- 11.3, p = 0.006), had fewer articular (34% vs. 78%, p = 0.001) and ocular sicca (62% vs. 88%, P = 0.01) than those without RTA (n = 41) and commonly presented with hypokalemic paralysis. On biopsy, TIN (9/17) and IgA nephropathy (3/17) were most common. On follow-up, there was no clinically significant change in eGFR; however, one patient with renal calculi and incomplete distal renal tubular acidosis (dRTA) progressed to complete dRTA. Two patients treated with steroids had marginal improvement in eGFR. Renal involvement in pSS is under-recognized with the most common manifestation being RTA presenting with hypokalemic paralysis. These patients are younger with less articular and sicca symptoms. Subclinical RTA may progress to complete RTA. Renal biopsy should be considered in all patients with renal involvement.Copyright © 2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.",Excluded
3290,"Single-balloon versus double-balloon bipedicular kyphoplasty for osteoporotic vertebral compression fractures. Twenty-eight patients with osteoporotic vertebral compression fractures (OVCF) were treated with single-balloon bipedicular kyphoplasty (Group A), and 40 patients were treated with double-balloon bipedicular kyphoplasty (Group B). Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) score, vertebral height, and kyphotic angle (KA) were evaluated pre-operatively, post-operatively (3 days after surgery) and at final follow-up. Operative time, X-ray exposure frequency and costs were recorded. The mean operative time and X-ray exposure frequency in Group A were greater than in Group B (p < 0.05). Significant improvement of the VAS score was noted in each group, and remained unchanged at final follow-up. Mean increases of anterior and middle height of the fractured vertebral body were 5.14 mm and 4.14 mm in Group A, respectively, and 6.22 mm and 5.06 mm in Group B, respectively, and the differences between the groups were statistically significant (p < 0.05). Mean reduction of KA was 6.9degree in Group A and 8.8degree in Group B, which was statistically significant (p < 0.05). No statistically significant difference was observed in terms of cement leakage between groups. The mean cost of Group A (US$4202) was significantly less than that of Group B (US$6220) (p < 0.001). Single-balloon bipedicular kyphoplasty is a safe and cost-effective surgical method for the treatment of OVCF. It can achieve pain relief comparable with double-balloon bipedicular kyphoplasty. However, double-balloon bipedicular kyphoplasty is more efficacious in terms of the restoration of vertebral height and reduction of KA, and the operative time and X-ray exposure frequency are lower.Copyright © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

110,"Carbon ion radiotherapy for oligo-recurrent lung metastases from colorectal cancer: A feasibility study. Background: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the efficacy and feasibility of carbon ion radiotherapy (CIRT) for oligo-recurrent lung tumors from colorectal cancer (CRC). Method(s): From May 1997 to October 2012, 34 consecutive patients with oligo-recurrent pulmonary metastases from CRC were treated with CIRT. The patients were not surgical candidates for medical reasons or patient refusal. Using a respiratory-gated technique, carbon ion therapy was delivered with curative intent using 4 coplanar beam angles. A median dose of 60 GyE (range, 44-64.8 GyE) was delivered to the planning target volume (PTV), with a median daily dose of 15 GyE (range, 3.6-44 GyE). Treatment outcome was analyzed in terms of local control rate (LCR), survival rate, and treatment-related complications. Result(s): In total, 34 patients with 44 oligo-recurrent pulmonary lesions were treated with CIRT. Median follow-up period was 23.7 months. The 2- and 3-year actuarial LCRs of the treated patients were 85.4% +/- 6.2% and 85.4% +/- 6.2%, respectively. Overall survival was 65.1% +/- 9.5% at 2 years, and 50.1% +/- 10.5% at 3 years. Although survival rates were relatively worse in the subsets of patients aged < 63 years or with early metastasis (< 36 months after resection of primary site), these factors were not significantly correlated with overall survival (P = 0.13 and 0.19, respectively). All treatment-related complications were self-limited, without any grade 3-5 toxicity. Conclusion(s): CIRT is one of the most effective nonsurgical treatments for colorectal lung metastases, which are relatively resistant to stereotactic body radiotherapy. CIRT is considered to be the least invasive approach even in patients who have undergone repeated prior thoracic metastasectomies. © 2014 Takahashi et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",Excluded
533,"Incidence of Breast Cancer in the Life Span Study of Atomic Bomb Survivors: 1958-2009. The importance of reproductive history in breast tissue development and etiology of sporadic breast cancer in females is well established. However, there is limited evidence of factors, other than age, that modify risk of radiation-related breast cancer. In this study, we evaluated breast cancer incidence in the Life Span Study cohort of atomic bomb survivors, adding 11 years of follow-up and incorporating reproductive history data. We used Poisson regression models to describe radiation risks and modifying effects of age and reproductive factors. Among 62,534 females, we identified 1,470 breast cancers between 1958 and 2009. Of 397 new cases diagnosed since 1998, 75% were exposed before age 20. We found a strong linear dose response with excess relative risk (ERR) of 1.12 per Gy [95% confidence interval (CI): 0.73 to 1.59] for females at age 70 after exposure at age 30. The ERR decreased with increasing attained age ( P = 0.007) while excess absolute rate (EAR) increased with attained age up to age 70 ( P < 0.001). Age at menarche was a strong modifier of the radiation effect: for a given dose, both the ERR and EAR decreased with increasing age at menarche ( P = 0.007 and P < 0.001). Also, independently, age-at-exposure effects on ERR and EAR differed before and after menarche ( P = 0.043 and P = 0.015, respectively, relative to log-linear trends), with highest risks for exposures around menarche. Despite the small number of male breast cancers (n = 10), the data continue to suggest a dose response (ERR per Gy = 5.7; 95% CI: 0.3 to 30.8; P = 0.018). Persistently increased risk of female breast cancer after radiation exposure and its modification pattern suggests heightened breast sensitivity during puberty.",Excluded
2287,"Adjuvant versus neoadjuvant radiochemotherapy for locally advanced rectal cancer. Aim: The standard treatment for patients with clinically resectable rectal cancer is surgery. Postoperative radiochemotherapy is recommended for patients with advanced disease (pT3/4 or pN+). In recent years, encouraging results of preoperative radiotherapy have been reported. This prospective randomized phase-III trial (CAO/ARO/AIO-94) compares the efficacy of neoadjuvant radiochemotherapy to standard postoperative radiochemotherapy. We report on the design of the study and first results with regard to toxicity of radiochemotherapy and postoperative morbidity. Patients and Methods: Patients with locally advanced operable rectal cancer (uT3/4 or uN+, Mason CS III/IV) were randomly assigned to pre- or postoperative radiochemotherapy: A total dose of 50.4 Gy (single dose 1.8 Gy) was applied to the tumor and the pelvic lymph nodes. 5-FU (1,000 mg/m2/d) was administered concomitantly in the first and fifth week of radiation as 120-h continuous infusion. Four additional cycles of 5-FU chemotherapy (500 mg/m2/d, iv bolus) were applied. Radiochemotherapy was identical in both arms except for a small-volume boost of 5.4 Gy in the postoperative setting. Time interval between radiochemotherapy and surgery was 4-6 weeks in both arms. Techniques of surgery were standardized and included total mesorectal excision. In addition, stratification according to surgeons involved has been provided for. Primary endpoints of the study are 5-year overall-survival, local and distant control, secondary endpoints include rate of curative (R0) resections and sphincter saving procedures, toxicity of radiochemotherapy, surgical complications and quality of life. Result(s): As of 15th November 2000, 628 patients were randomized from 26 participating institutions: 310 patients were randomized to postoperative radiochemotherapy, 318 patients to preoperative radiochemotherapy. Acute toxicity (WHO) of radiochemotherapy was low, with less than 15% of patients experiencing Grade 3 or higher toxicity: The principal toxicity was diarrhea, with 12% in the postoperative radiochemotherapy arm and 10% in the preoperative radiochemotherapy arm having Grade-3, and 1% in either arm having Grade-4 diarrhea. Erythema, nausea and leukopenia were the next common toxicities, with less than 3% of patients in either arm suffering Grade 3 or greater leukopenia or nausea. Postoperative complication rates were similar in both arms, with 12% (postoperative radiochemotherapy) and 13% (preoperative radiochemotherapy) of patients, respectively, suffering from anastomotic leakage, 4% (postoperative radiochemotherapy) and 3% (preoperative radiochemotherapy) from postoperative bleeding, and 6% (postoperative radiochemotherapy) and 5% (preoperative radiochemotherapy) from delayed wound healing. Conclusion(s): The patient accrual of our trial is satisfactory, neoadjuvant radiochemotherapy is well tolerated and bears no higher risk for postoperative morbidity.",Excluded
1500,"Tumor heterogeneity determined with a gammaH2AX foci assay: A study in human head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (hHNSCC) models. Purpose This study aimed to analyze the intra-tumoral heterogeneity of gammaH2AX foci in tumor specimens following ex vivo radiation to evaluate the potential of gammaH2AX foci as predictors for radiosensitivity. Material and methods gammaH2AX foci were quantified in tumor specimens of 3 hHNSCC tumor models with known differences in radiosensitivity after reoxygenation in culture medium (10 h, 24 h), single dose exposure (0 Gy, 4 Gy), and fixation 24 h post-irradiation. Multiple, equally treated samples of the same tumor were analyzed for foci, normalized and fitted in a linear mixed-effects model. Results The ex vivo reoxygenation time had no significant effect on gammaH2AX foci counts. A significant intra model heterogeneity could be shown for FaDu (p = 0.033) but not for SKX (p = 0.167) and UT-SCC-5 (p = 0.082) tumors, respectively. All tumor models showed a significant intra-tumoral heterogeneity between specimens of the same tumor (p < 0.01) or among microscopic fields of a particular tumor specimen (p < 0.0001). Conclusion Similar results for ex vivo gammaH2AX foci between 10 h and 24 h reoxygenation time support the applicability of the assay in a clinical setting. The high intra-tumoral heterogeneity underlines the necessity of multiple analyzable samples per patient and therewith the need for an automated foci analysis.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",Excluded
2731,"Increased protoporphyrin IX accumulation does not improve the effect of photodynamic therapy for actinic keratosis: a randomized controlled trial. Background: Photodynamic therapy (PDT) with methyl aminolaevulinate (MAL) is highly effective for treating actinic keratosis (AK) on the face/scalp, but less effective on the extremities. Insufficient accumulation of protoporphyrin IX (PpIX) may cause these inferior efficacy rates. However, it is possible to increase PpIX accumulation by extending the MAL application time and/or pretreating the skin with curettage. Objective(s): To investigate whether increased PpIX accumulation improves the effect of MAL-PDT for AKs in a randomized intra-individual study. Method(s): Twenty-two patients with 533 AKs on both hands were treated with MAL-PDT. To obtain different concentrations of PpIX, four symmetrical areas on each patient were randomly allocated to different regimens: (i) 3-h MAL application without prior curettage (3hC-); (ii) 3 h with curettage (3hC+); (iii) 21 h without curettage (21hC-); and (iv) 21 h with curettage (21hC+). Treatment efficacy was evaluated after 3 months, whereas PpIX fluorescence, pain and erythema were assessed during and after PDT. Result(s): Extended MAL application with and without curettage increased PpIX accumulation significantly compared with the standard 3hC+ regimen (P = 0.001 and P = 0.002, respectively). However, the median total clearance rates did not improve accordingly: 3hC+ (55.0%), 21hC- (55.0%) and 21hC+ (53.6%). Conversely, insufficient PpIX accumulation in the 3hC- regimen led to a significantly lower clearance rate (33.3%) than the other regimens (P < 0.045). Furthermore, pain and erythema were correlated to PpIX accumulation. Conclusion(s): Increased PpIX accumulation does not improve the effect of MAL-PDT for AKs on the hands, but leads to worse adverse events. Different strategies are needed to improve PDT on the extremities.Copyright © 2016 British Association of Dermatologists",Excluded

The mean age was 52 years and the male to female ratio 3.2:1. Diagnosis of SPB was confirmed by biopsy in 16 patients and tumour excision in seven. 20 patients received megavoltage radiotherapy to the bone lesion with limited margins, and one received chemotherapy. Two patients who underwent complete tumour excision received no further treatment. All seven patients with EMP received megavoltage radiotherapy, four following biopsy and three after tumour excision. Local control was achieved in all patients with SPB. Nine progressed to multiple myeloma and one developed a solitary plasmacytoma in another bone. Six patients with EMP achieved local control. Three later progressed to multiple myeloma and one had local relapse. Median time to relapse was 28 months in SPB and 30 months in EMP. 5-year overall survival rates were 82% and 57% for patients with SPB and EMP, respectively. The corresponding progression free survival rates were 55% and 50%, respectively. Age, sex, site of tumour, serum M protein and haemoglobin levels did not significantly influence progression free survival. The extent of surgery, radiotherapy dose or time to relapse were not significant prognostic factors. Radiotherapy appears to be an effective modality of treatment of solitary plasmacytoma. No dose-response relationship is observed, and high local control rates are achieved with limited portals. Progression to multiple myeloma is the commonest pattern of failure, although no prognostic factors for progression are identified.

All 4 patients were treated with topical chemotherapy and additionally 1 patient each was treated with excisional biopsy and photodynamic therapy. The main outcome measure was the recurrence of OSSN and the clarity of corneal graft after treatment. Result(s): The mean time interval between corneal graft and diagnosis of OSSN was 36 months (range, 2 to 73 months). All 4 eyes were on chronic treatment with topical steroids for a minimum duration of 2 months and 2 eyes had previous herpes keratitis. Misdiagnosis of graft rejection was found in 2 cases. The mean tumor basal diameter was 18 mm (range, 14- to 25-mm) and the tumor involved a mean of 76% of the corneal surface (range, 15% to 90%). Management was successful in all cases using topical mitomycin C (n = 1), topical interferon alpha2b (n = 4), and photodynamic therapy (n = 1). At mean follow-up of 20 months, tumor control was achieved in all cases and all 4 eyes showed chronic graft opacification with vascularization but no intraocular tumor.

OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to project clinical outcomes, health care costs, and cost-effectiveness of coronary computed tomography angiography (CCTA), as compared with conventional diagnostic technologies, in the evaluation of patients with stable chest pain and suspected coronary artery disease (CAD)., BACKGROUND: CCTA has recently been found to be effective in the evaluation of patients with suspected CAD, but investigators have raised concerns related to radiation exposure, incidental findings, and nondiagnostic exams., METHODS: With published data, we developed a computer simulation model to project clinical outcomes, health care costs, and cost-effectiveness of CCTA, compared with conventional testing modalities, in the diagnosis of CAD. Our target population included 55-year-old patients who present to their primary care physicians with stable chest pain., RESULTS: All diagnostic strategies yielded similar health outcomes, but performing CCTA-with or without stress testing or performing stress single-photon emission computed tomography-marginally minimized adverse events and maximized longevity and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs). Health outcomes associated with these strategies were comparable, with CCTA in men and women yielding the greatest QALYs but only by modest margins. Overall differences were small, and performing the most effective test-compared with the least effective-decreased adverse event rates by 3% in men and women. Comparable increases in longevity and QALYs were 2 months and 0.1 QALYs in men and 1 month and 0.03 QALYs in women. CCTA raised overall costs, partly through the follow-up of incidental findings, and when performed with stress testing, its incremental cost-effectiveness ratio ranged from $26,200/QALY in men to $35,000/QALY in women. Health outcomes were marginally less favorable in women when radiation risks were considered., CONCLUSIONS: CCTA is comparable to other diagnostic studies and might hold good clinical value, but large randomized controlled trials are needed to guide policy.",Excluded

The distant metastases rates were 42.6% and 51.4% (p=0.274) respectively. Grade 3-4 hematological toxicity and radiation esophagitis had no statistically significant, but grade 3-4 radiation pneumonia was observed in only 7.4% in the arm without CTV, compared 22.9% in the arm with CTV (p=0.040). The median survival in the arm without CTV had not reached, compared with 38 months in the with CTV arm. The l- years, 2- years, 3- years survival rates of the arm without CTV and the arm with CTV were 81.0%, 66.2%, 61.5% and 88.6%, 61.7%, 56.6% (p=0.517). The multivariate analysis indicated that the distant metastases (p=0.000) and PCI factor (p=0.004) were significantly related to overall survival., CONCLUSIONS: Target delineation omitting CTV for limited-disease small cell lung cancer received IMRT was feasible. The distant metastases and PCI factor were significantly related to overall survival.",Excluded
2632,"Association of clinical response and long-term outcome among patients with biopsied orbital pseudotumor receiving modern radiation therapy. Purpose: To retrospectively evaluate institutional outcomes for patients treated with modern radiation therapy (RT) for biopsied orbital pseudotumor (OP). Methods and Materials: Twenty patients (26 affected orbits) with OP were treated with RT between January 2002 and December 2011. All patients underwent biopsy with histopathologic exclusion of other disease processes. Sixteen patients (80%) were treated with intensity modulated RT, 3 (15%) with opposed lateral beams, and 1 (5%) with electrons. Median RT dose was 27 Gy (range 25.2-30.6 Gy). Response to RT was evaluated at 4 months post-RT. Partial response (PR) was defined as improvement in orbital symptoms without an increase in steroid dose. Complete response (CR) 1 and CR 2 were defined as complete resolution of orbital symptoms with reduction in steroid dose (CR 1) or complete tapering of steroids (CR 2). The median follow-up period was 18.6 months (range 4-81.6 months). Result(s): Seventeen patients (85%) demonstrated response to RT, with 7 (35%), 1 (5%), and 9 (45%) achieving a PR, CR 1, and CR 2, respectively. Of the 17 patients who had >=PR at 4 months post-RT, 6 (35%) experienced recurrence of symptoms. Age (>46 years vs <=46 years, P=.04) and clinical response to RT (CR 2 vs CR 1/PR, P=.05) were significantly associated with pseudotumor recurrence. Long-term complications were seen in 7 patients (35%), including 4 with cataract formation, 1 with chronic dry eye, 1 with enophthalmos, and 1 with keratopathy. Conclusion(s): RT is an effective treatment for improving symptoms and tapering steroids in patients with a biopsy supported diagnosis of OP. Older age and complete response to RT were associated with a significantly reduced probability of symptom recurrence. The observed late complications may be related to RT, chronic use of steroids/immunosuppressants, medical comorbidities, or combination of factors. © 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.",Excluded
2373,"Stricture of the proximal esophagus in head and neck carcinoma patients after radiotherapy. BACKGROUND. It is well recognized that many patients with head and neck carcinoma have problems with food intake and malnutrition. The objective of the current study was to determine the clinical pattern of patients with nonneoplastic stricture of the upper esophagus after radiotherapy for head and neck carcinoma. METHODS. A retrospective chart study of 22 patients with stricture of the proximal esophagus diagnosed between 1993 and 1999 at Karolinska Hospital was performed. The dose volume histograms of the first 2 cm and 5 cm, respectively, of the proximal esophagus were calculated. RESULTS. Five of the patients (23%) had total obliteration. The first 2 cm of the esophagus received at least 60 grays (Gy) in > 80% of the volume. Radiation injury was not reported to occur at doses < 60 Gy. There was a correlation found between dysphagia during radiotherapy and the development of proximal esophageal stricture. Stricture was diagnosed 1-60 months (median, 6 months) after radiotherapy. In 18 patients, the stricture was treated with single or repeated endoscopic dilation. These treatments allowed a nearly normal diet in 78% of the patients. CONCLUSIONS. Stricture of the upper esophagus is one deglutition disorder that is reported to occur after radiotherapy for head and neck carcinoma. In the current study, the authors emphasize the importance of knowing the tolerance of the normal esophagus to irradiation as well as early diagnosis of stricture of the proximal esophagus because this condition may lead to physical and emotional distress. © 2003 American Cancer Society.",Excluded
2390,"Intraoperative C-arm CT imaging in angular stable plate osteosynthesis of distal radius fractures. The purpose of this study was to analyze the practicability and benefit of intraoperative C-arm computed tomography (CT) imaging in volar plate osteosynthesis of unstable distal radius fractures. During a 1 year period, intraoperative three dimensional (3D) imaging with the ARCADIS Orbic 3D was performed in addition to standard fluoroscopy in 51 cases. The volar angular stable plate oesteosyntheses were analyzed intraoperatively and, if necessary, improved immediately. The duration of the scan and radiation exposure dose were measured. On average, performance of the scan and analysis of the CT dataset took 6.7 minutes. In 31.3% of the surgeries a misplacement of screws was detected and correction was done immediately. C-arm CT imaging can easily be integrated in the normal course of surgery. As a complement to the standard 2D-fluoroscopy, the C-arm CT is a useful tool to evaluate the quality of osteosynthesis.",Excluded
2559,"[The aqueous humour antioxidative capacity in different types and color of the age-related cataract]. BACKGROUND/AIM: Oxidative stress results from increased oxidative processes, decreased antioxidative protection, or both processes simultaneously. Photooxidative stress, as a form of oxidative stress, induced by the energy of solar radiation, today is considered as crucial in the age-related cataractogenesis. Other known and unknown, endogenous and egsogenous factors that contribute to the oxidative stress intensity, can influnce the cataract type and brunescence. Thus the oxidative stress intensity and its form might determine the cataract type and brunescence, and also make the efforts in cataract prevention more complex. Hence, the objective of the present paper was to investigate the current amount of antioxidative capacity in aqueous humour during the cataract genesis of different types and pigmentation of cataract., METHODS: Transversal review of 80 samples of humour aqueous obtained during extracapsular cataract extraction. Aqueouses were analyzed by tiobarbituric acid (TBA) method for the total antioxidant activity estimation, expressed as %iMDA, and by using 0.1 ml of aqueous., RESULTS: The mixed type of cataract showed the statistically significantly lower values of the intensities of antioxidative protection in aqueous humour compared to cortical and nuclear cataracts (p < 0.001, respectively). Between pure nuclear and cortical cataracts we found the small differences of the investigated parameter, but they pointed to the decreased level of antioxidative protection, i.e. the increased intensity of the aqueous humour oxidative stress in the cortical cataract type. A significant correlation betweer the cortical cataract maturation and the %iMDA (p < 0.05) was found., CONCLUSIONS: The role of the oxidative stress, here expressed as the antioxidative capacity of aqueous humour, could not be the same for all the cataract types. The lower level of antioxidative protection of aqueous in brunescent and mixed cataracts may point to the higher intensity of oxidative stress in those cataract types. The correlation betweer the cortical cataract maturity and %iMDA points to the significant decrease of the aqueous antioxidative protection in the cataract progression.",Excluded
2527,"Comparison of distal interphalangeal fusion with and without joint preparation in cases of stage IV chondropathy. The main complications in distal interphalangeal (DIP) fusion are non-union and hardware-related symptoms. The primary aim of this study was to show that joint preparation for DIP fusion is not necessary in cases of stage IV chondropathy. The secondary aim was to show that use of buried compression screws decreases the complication rate. This continuous retrospective study included two groups of DIP percutaneous arthrodesis procedures carried out with 1.8. mm break-away compression screws: group 1 underwent joint preparation through a dorsal approach and group 2 underwent a percutaneous procedure without joint preparation. Group 1 included 15 patients (18 fingers) with a mean age of 65.3 years, representing nine cases of osteoarthritis, four cases of open trauma, one of gout, and one of rheumatoid arthritis. Group 2 included 18 patients (21 fingers) with a mean age of 58.9 years, representing 16 cases of osteoarthritis, one of rheumatoid arthritis and one of swan-neck deformity. Tourniquet time was longer in group 1 (61. min) than in group 2 (24. min). The amount of emitted ionizing radiation was not different between groups. Pain and QuickDASH scores were not improved in group 1 but they were in group 2. There was no difference in the fusion time. One non-union was observed in group 1. Our results show that joint preparation for DIP arthrodesis is unnecessary in stage IV chondropathy. No hardware-related complications were observed.Copyright © 2015 Elsevier Masson SAS.",Excluded
1561,"Plasminogen is a master regulator and a potential drug candidate for the healing of radiation wounds. Around 95% of cancer patients undergoing radiotherapy experience cutaneous side effects, and some develop radiation wounds or fibrosis. Currently, there is no effective treatment for these indications. We show here that plasminogen administration enhanced the healing of radiation wounds via pleiotropic effects on gene expression. Using RNA sequencing, we found that plasminogen downregulated the expression of genes in the TLR, TNF, WNT, MAPK, and TGF-beta signaling pathways, and enhanced the anti-inflammatory effect of arachidonic acid, leading to significantly decreased inflammation and improved remodeling of granulation tissue compared with placebo treatment. In addition, plasminogen induced metabolic changes, including decreased glycolysis. Importantly, many of the factors downregulated by plasminogen are pro-fibrotic. Therefore, in radiation wounds with excessive inflammation, plasminogen is able to enhance and redirect the healing process, such that it more closely resembles physiological healing with significantly reduced risk for developing fibrosis. This makes plasminogen an attractive drug candidate for the treatment of radiation wounds in cancer patients.Copyright © 2020, The Author(s).",Excluded
769,"Evaluation of light-emitting diode (LED-835 NM) application over human gingival fibroblast: An in vitro study. Since the laser and photomodulation were discovered over 50 years, they have been used for many applications in medicine and in dentistry also. In particular, light-emitting diodes therapy (LT) achieved a great success in medical treatment and photo-therapy. In the decades, LT has been used for several therapeutic purposes. Many beneficial effects have been demonstrated in vitro and in vivo, including antibacterial, antiviral, antitumor, cell differentiation, immune potentiating and tissue repair activities. Beneficial effects of LT have also been observed in clinical settings. Although there are lots of cell culture studies in low-level laser therapy, there are only a few cell culture studies in LT that have similar characteristics. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of LT on primary human gingival fibroblast cells (HGF) on elastin (ELN) gene activation using Real Time PCR. ELN gene activation is directly connected with elastin protein production and HGF functionality. Human gingival tissue biopsies were obtained from three healthy patients during tooth extraction. The gingival specimens were fragmented with a scalpel and transferred in culture dishes containing Dulbecco's modified Eagle medium supplemented with 20% fetal calf serum (FBS) and antibiotics, i.e. penicillin 100U/ml and streptomycin 100mug/ml. Cells were incubated in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2 at 37C. The medium was changed the next day and twice a week. After 15 days, the samples of gingival tissue were removed from the culture dishes. Cells were harvested after an additional 24 h incubation. Human gingival fibroblasts at the second passage were seeded on multiple 6-well plates. The cells stimulation was performed with a light-emitting diodes (LEDs) medical device type E-Light. The LED irradiation seems to be directly correlated with the elastin (ELN) gene activation. Interestingly, ELN gene expression in the cultured human gingival fibroblasts seems to be inversely related to the patients' age; in fact, its expression tends to decrease with aging. In summary, the result of the present study shows that LED irradiation promoted ELN gene expression more in elderly than in younger adults.Copyright © by BIOLIFE, s.a.s.",Excluded

715,"Endovascular treatment of ruptured internal carotid artery pseudoaneurysms after irradiation for nasopharyngeal carcinoma patients. Objectives To evaluate the efficacy and complications of endovascular treatment for ruptured internal carotid artery pseudoaneurysms following irradiation of nasopharyngeal carcinoma. Design Retrospective case series. Setting Tertiary neurosurgical referral unit of a Hong Kong public hospital. Patients Patients with ruptured radiation-induced internal carotid artery pseudoaneurysms that were treated endovascularly from October 1999 to October 2011 at Queen Elizabeth Hospital were reviewed. Hospital records, imaging, and angiographic data were studied. Results During the study period, 15 such nasopharyngeal carcinoma patients were treated by endovascular means at Queen Elizabeth Hospital. Ten presented with epistaxis, three with otorrhagia (bleeding from the ear), and two with both. Therapeutic occlusion of the affected internal carotid artery was performedin four patients, and stenting of the artery (with or without coil obliteration of the pseudoaneurysm) was performed in 11. Immediate haemostasis was achieved in all cases. One (7%) of the 15 patients endured symptomatic recurrence of the pseudoaneurysm, and in another an asymptomatic residualpseudoaneurysm was noted in the follow-up angiogram. Three patients suffered clinically significant procedure-related complications, including cerebral infarction (n=2) and brain abscess (n=1). In the angiograms obtained after a mean posttreatment interval of 13 (range, 0.7-60) months, the stent patency rate was 67%. All three patients with occluded stents were asymptomatic. Conclusions Ruptured internal carotid artery pseudoaneurysms following radiotherapy is a rare but life-threatening condition. Endovascular treatment by occlusion or reconstruction of the internal carotid artery with stents provides immediate haemostasis and obliteration of the pseudoaneurysms, with a low recurrence rate. Long-term follow-up is necessary to look out for delayed posttreatment complications.",Excluded
2481,"Expression of salivary biomarkers in patients with oral mucositis: evaluation by SELDI-TOF/MS. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to evaluate changes in proteomic salivary profile of patients with oral mucositis after adjuvant cancer treatments., MATERIALS AND METHODS: Samples were collected from patients after adjuvant cancer therapies, and were analyzed by means of SELDI/TOF. Patients were separated in two groups: patients affected by mucositis (MUCOSITIS) and patient without mucositis (NO MUCOSITIS). All patients were divided in function of the anticancer treatment: patients who had radiotherapy (MUCOSITIS RADIO), had not radiotherapy (MUCOSITIS NO RADIO), had chemotherapy (MUCOSITIS CHEMO), and those who had not chemotherapy (MUCOSITIS NO CHEMO). Statistical evaluation PCA (Principal Component Analysis) was conducted with the software BIO-RAD Data Manager( TM) (Version 3.5)., RESULTS: We found the increased peaks of 3443, 3487, and 4135 m/z in MUCOSITIS group, while 6237 m/z was reduced. These same peaks would the same modifications in MUCOSITIS RADIO, while in MUCOSITIS CHEMIO are increased 3443 and 6237 m/z but 3487, 4135 m/z are reduced. These data were confirmed by the PCA., CONCLUSION: Anticancer therapy influenced the level expression of many salivary biomarkers in mucositis with a good significance. Therefore, 3443, 3487, 4135, and 6237 m/z are good biomarker candidates of oral mucositis. Copyright © 2015 John Wiley & Sons A/S. Published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",Excluded
2732,"Surgical treatment for diffused-type giant cell tumor (pigmented villonodular synovitis) about the ankle joint. Background: Diffused-type giant cell tumor(Dt-GCT) is a rare, aggressive disorder of the joint synovium, bursa and tendon sheaths. Osseous erosions and subchondral cysts may develop as the result of synovium infiltration in Dt-GCT. We present a retrospective study of a series of patients who are diagnosed with Dt-GCT about the ankle joint, there clinical outcome is evaluated in this study. Material(s) and Method(s): Fifteen patients with radiologically and histologically confirmed Dt-GCT about the ankle joint were identified in our foot and ankle department. Patients were managed with open synovectomy for the tumor tissue and bone grafting for bony erosions. X-rays and MRI scans were used for evaluation of the tumor and bony erosions pre- and post-operatively. Pre- and post-operative ankle function was assessed using the American Orthopedic Foot and Ankle Society -Ankle and Hindfoot (AOFAS-AH) score and the Muscularskeletal Tumor Society (MSTS) score. Result(s): The mean follow-up duration was 37.4 months (range 25 to 50 months). There were 6 males and 9 females, with a mean age of 35 years old (range 18 to 65 years). All patients had talar erosion with the average size of 10.1*9.1z.ast;8.2 mm, distal tibia was affected in 5 patients with the average size of 6.2 5.6 5.8 mm. 7 patients had tendon involvement, 2 patients had recurrence and progression of ankle osteoarthritis.

277,"53BP1 Repair Kinetics for Prediction of In Vivo Radiation Susceptibility in 15 Mouse Strains. We present a novel mathematical formalism to predict the kinetics of DNA damage repair after exposure to both low- and high-LET radiation (X rays; 350 MeV/n 40Ar; 600 MeV/n 56Fe). Our method is based on monitoring DNA damage repair protein 53BP1 that forms radiation-induced foci (RIF) at locations of DNA double-strand breaks (DSB) in the nucleus and comparing its expression in primary skin fibroblasts isolated from 15 mice strains. We previously reported strong evidence for clustering of nearby DSB into single repair units as opposed to the classic ""contact-first"" model where DSB are considered immobile. Here we apply this clustering model to evaluate the number of remaining RIF over time. We also show that the newly introduced kinetic metrics can be used as surrogate biomarkers for in vivo radiation toxicity, with potential applications in radiotherapy and human space exploration. In particular, we observed an association between the characteristic time constant of RIF repair measured in vitro and survival levels of immune cells collected from irradiated mice. Moreover, the speed of DNA damage repair correlated not only with radiation-induced cellular survival in vivo, but also with spontaneous cancer incidence data collected from the Mouse Tumor Biology database, suggesting a relationship between the efficiency of DSB repair after irradiation and cancer risk.Copyright ©2020 by Radiation Research Society.

PURPOSE: To compare the outcomes (survival and adverse events) of the authors' use of (90) Y microsphere radioembolisation in patients with chemotherapy-refractory liver metastases with published data from other groups using radioembolisation. To retrospectively evaluate the efficiency, in particular survival benefits, of radioembolisation in the treatment of liver metastases., METHODS AND MATERIALS: Over 5 years, 339 patients underwent (90) Y microsphere radioembolisation for unresectable liver metastases and were evaluated for adverse events at the time of treatment and 1 and 3 months after treatment. Overall survival (OS) was calculated by the Kaplan-Meier method. The results from the present retrospective study were compared with a number of prospective and retrospective clinical trials which have addressed the use of (90) Y microspheres as a salvage treatment for liver metastases., RESULTS: The OS time of the present study (12.0 months) compares favourably with survival times reported by other groups. The incidence of late grade 2 adverse events (e.g. duodenal or gastric ulceration, radiation-induced liver disease, gall bladder complications) is comparable to previous studies, with a lower prevalence of grade 2/3 ulcerations (3.7%) at our centre., CONCLUSIONS: The survival results, together with the low acute and late toxicity observed in our data and previous studies, support the use of radioembolisation to aid in the local control of unresectable liver metastases in the salvage setting.

2690,"Prognostic impact of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) expression on loco-regional recurrence after preoperative radiotherapy in rectal cancer. BACKGROUND: Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) represents a major target for current radiosensitizing strategies. We wished to ascertain whether a correlation exists between the expression of EGFR and treatment outcome in a group of patients with rectal adenocarcinoma who had undergone preoperative radiotherapy (RT)., METHODS: Within a six-year period, 138 patients underwent preoperative radiotherapy and curative surgery for rectal cancer (UICC stages II-III) at our institute. Among them, 77 pretherapeutic tumor biopsies were available for semi-quantitative immunohistochemical investigation evaluating the intensity and the number (extent) of tumor stained cells. Statistical analyses included Cox regression for calculating risk ratios of survival endpoints and logistic regression for determining odds ratios for the development of loco-regional recurrences., RESULTS: Median age was 64 years (range: 30-88). Initial staging showed 75% and 25% stage II and III tumors, respectively. RT consisted of 44-Gy pelvic irradiation in 2-Gy fractions using 18-MV photons. In 25 very low-rectal-cancer patients the primary tumor received a boost dose of up to 16 Gy for a sphincter-preservation approach. Concomitant chemotherapy was used in 17% of the cases. All patients underwent complete total mesorectal resection. Positive staining (EGFR+) was observed in 43 patients (56%). Median follow-up was 36 months (range: 6-86). Locoregional recurrence rates were 7 and 20% for EGFR extent inferior and superior to 25%, respectively. The corresponding locoregional recurrence-free survival rate at two years was 94% (95% confidence interval, CI, 92-98%) and 84% (CI 95%, 58-95%), respectively (P = 0.06). Multivariate analyses showed a significant correlation between the rate of loco-regional recurrence and three parameters: EGFR extent superior to 25% (hazard ratio = 7.18, CI 95%, 1.17-46, P = 0.037), rectal resection with microscopic residue (hazard ratio = 6.92, CI 95%, 1.18-40.41, P = 0.032), and a total dose of 44 Gy (hazard ratio = 5.78, CI 95%, 1.04-32.05, P = 0.045)., CONCLUSION: EGFR expression impacts on loco-regional recurrence. Knowledge of expression of EGFR in rectal cancer could contribute to the identification of patients with an increased risk of recurrences, and to the prediction of prognosis.",Excluded

In head and neck cancer (HNC) patients, long-term treatment-related complications include radiotherapy (RT)-induced carotid vasculopathy and stroke. The current study investigated the magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) characteristics of the carotid wall in long-term HNC survivors treated with RT.Methods. MRI of the carotid arteries was performed within a prospective cohort of 42 HNC patients on average 7 years after RT. Two independent radiologists assessed maximal vessel wall thickness of common and internal carotid arteries. In case of wall thickening (>= 2 mm) the MRI signals as well as length of the thickened segment were assessed.Results. Mean (SD) age of the 42 patients at baseline was 53 (13) years and mean (SD) follow-up time after RT was 6.8 (1.3) years. In total 62% were men and 60% had one or more cerebrovascular risk factors. Mean (SD) dose of RT on the common carotid arteries and internal carotid arteries was 57 Gy (11) and 61 Gy (10), respectively. Wall thickening was observed in 58% of irradiated versus 27% of non-irradiated common carotid arteries and 24% of irradiated versus 6% of non-irradiated internal carotid arteries (p < 0.05). Mean (SD) thickness of the irradiated and non-irradiated common carotid arteries was 2.5 (0.9) and 2 (0.7) mm (p = 0.02). Mean thickness of the irradiated and non-irradiated internal carotid arteries was 1.8 (0.8) and 1.5 mm (0.3) (n.s.).

3316,"High validity of measuring the width and volume of medial meniscal extrusion three-dimensionally using an MRI-derived tibial model. Background: Medial meniscal extrusion (MME) is an important marker of knee osteoarthritis (KOA) progression. The purposes of this study were: 1) to determine whether there are morphological differences between CT- and MRI-derived tibial plateau models; and 2) to determine whether measurement of MME volume and width using an MRI-derived tibial model is as accurate as measurements on a CT-derived tibial model. Method(s): This was a cross-sectional study that enrolled ten participants with medial KOA (Kellgren-Lawrence grade 1 to 3). Primary outcome was surface difference of the medial tibial plateau between CT- and MRI-derived models. Furthermore, volume and cross-sectional area of the medial tibial plateau were compared between CT- and MRI-derived models. Measurements of MME volume and width were compared between CT- and MRI-derived tibial models. Result(s): Minimal and maximal surface differences of the medial tibial plateau between the CT- and MRI-derived models were - 0.15 [- 0.44, 0.14] mm (mean [95% confidence interval]) and 0.24 [- 0.09, 0.57] mm, respectively. There were no significant differences in volume and cross-sectional area of the medial tibial plateau between CT- and MRI-derived tibial models. The MME volumes measured on CT- and MRI-derived models were 942.6 [597.7, 1287.6] mm3 and 916.2 [557.9, 1274.6] mm3, respectively (p = 0.938).

1025,"The utility of PET/CT in staging and assessment of treatment response of nasopharyngeal cancer. Introduction: The aim of this study was to evaluate the impact of positron emission tomography/computerised tomography (PET/CT) as an adjunct to conventional imaging (CI) in the management of nasopharyngeal cancer (NPC) both for initial staging and assessment of post-treatment response. Method(s): All NPC cases referred to the Peter MacCallum Centre for Metabolic Imaging between January 2002 and December 2007 were identified. In patients undergoing initial staging, any differences between the pre-PET/CT management plan based on CI and that following performance of the PET/CT scan were noted. Clinical impact was scored using the Centre's published criteria: 'high' if PET/CT changed the primary treatment modality or intent, 'medium' if treatment modality was unchanged but the radiotherapy technique or dose was altered, and 'low' if there was no change in treatment modality or intent. Patients undergoing PET/CT following definitive treatment were scored according to whether or not they achieved a complete metabolic response. Result(s): Forty-eight patients underwent a staging PET/CT. The clinical impact was high in 8%, medium in 25% and low in 66% of patients. Twenty-one patients were scanned for post-treatment response. PET/CT was less frequently equivocal than MRI (3 vs 8/21). A complete metabolic response on PET/CT was associated with a 93% negative predictive value for subsequent recurrence. Conclusion(s): PET/CT is a valuable staging tool for the detection of occult metastatic disease and defining the extent of neck nodal disease. Post-treatment, a complete metabolic response on PET/CT has a very high negative predictive value with fewer equivocal results than MRI. © 2011 The Royal Australian and New Zealand College of Radiologists.",Excluded
1429,"Proton pump inhibitor use and risk of community-acquired Clostridium difficile-associated disease defined by prescription for oral vancomycin therapy. BACKGROUND: The association between the use of proton pump inhibitors and the risk of Clostridium difficile-associated disease (CDAD) is controversial. In this study we re-examined a previously reported association between the use of proton pump inhibitors and the development of community-acquired CDAD, this time using an alternative case definition of the disease., METHODS: We performed a case-control study of community-acquired CDAD using a United Kingdom clinical research database. Patients receiving oral vancomycin therapy were identified as having CDAD, the only indication for this drug. Each case subject was matched with up to 10 control subjects. Neither the cases nor the controls had been admitted to hospital in the year before the date of the vancomycin prescription (index date). Conditional logistic regression analysis was used to adjust for key covariates., RESULTS: We identified 317 cases of community-acquired CDAD treated with oral vancomycin therapy and 3167 matched control subjects. Exposure to a proton pump inhibitor in the 90 days before the index date was associated with an increased risk of CDAD (odds ratio [OR] 3.5, 95% confidence interval [CI] 2.3-5.2). Antibiotic exposure in the 90 days before the index date was also a significant risk factor for community-acquired CDAD (OR 8.2, 95% CI 6.1- 11.0), even though 45% of the case subjects had not received a prescription for an antibiotic during that period. Certain comorbidities, in particular renal failure, inflammatory bowel disease and malignant disease, as well as prior methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus infection, were also associated with an increased risk., INTERPRETATION: Proton pump inhibitor use was associated with an increased risk of community-acquired CDAD, when cases were defined by receipt of prescription for oral vancomycin therapy. Prior antibiotic exposure was also a significant risk factor, but a significant proportion of the patients with community-acquired CDAD had no such exposure.",Excluded
3092,"Impact of Significant Coronary Artery Calcification Reported on Low-Dose Computed Tomography Lung Cancer Screening. BACKGROUND: Coronary artery calcification (CAC) is a common and important incidental finding in low-dose computed tomography (LDCT) performed for lung cancer screening (LCS). The impact of these incidental findings on patient management is unclear., PURPOSE: The goals of our study were to determine the impact of reporting CAC on patient management and to determine whether standardized reporting of CAC affects the likelihood of future interventions., METHODS: In this IRB-approved retrospective study, we queried our LCS database for reports of LDCT performed between January 2016 and September 2018. All reports with significant findings of CAC designated with the letter ""S"" for any Lung-RADS category were selected. The grading of CAC was extracted from the reports. Medical records were reviewed for each patient to determine demographics, clinical history, medications, and cardiac-related diagnostic and interventional procedures. The changes in management after the report of significant CAC on LDCT were documented. Statistical analysis with Student t test and Pearson chi test was performed., RESULTS: A total of 756/3110 patients (mean age: 67+/-6.4 y; M=466, 61.6%: F=290, 38.4%) were reported to have significant CAC on LDCT for LCS. Of them, 236/756 patients (31.2%) had established coronary artery disease (CAD) at baseline, before the initial LDCT. A change in management was observed in 155/756 patients (20.5%). The most common changes in management included the following: alteration in medication regimen (n=114/155, 73.5%), stress testing (n=65/155, 41.9%), and referral to a cardiologist (36/155, 23.2%). Percutaneous coronary intervention (4, 2.6%) and surgery (3, 1.9%) were uncommon. Changes in management were more common in those without established CAD and in those whose CAC was semiquantitatively graded (35% vs. 25%, P=0.02)., CONCLUSION: CAC is a common significant finding in LDCT for LCS. Reporting of CAC in patients with nonestablished CAD and semiquantitative assessment resulted in changes in management.",Excluded

1146,"Optimization of 131I ablation in patients with differentiated thyroid carcinoma: comparison of early outcomes of treatment with 100 mCi versus 60 mCi. INTRODUCTION: The aim of this study was to compare the early outcomes between two groups of patients with differentiated thyroid carcinoma (DTC) who received 60 or 100 mCi of (131)I for remnant ablation. MATERIAL AND METHODS: 224 DTC patients with primary tumor > 1 cm of diameter or multifocal were randomised into prospective clinical trial. Patients with extrathyroideal extension of primary tumor and nodal metastases or M1 were not enrolled. 99 patients received 60 mCi, and 125--100 mCi of radioiodine as the first ablative dose. RESULT(S): The effectiveness of thyroid ablation was evaluated after one year, during endogenous TSH (thyroid stimulating hormone) stimulation, and after two years during Lthyroxine therapy. Whole body scintigraphy (WBS) was performed under thyroxine withdrawal and thyroglobulin serum level was assessed. Distant micrometastases were detected in 9.8% of patients by post-therapy WBS, 11 patients in group A treated with 60 mCi and 11 in group B treated with 100 mCi. In other patients no symptoms of persistent disease were detected. At one year follow up full remission was diagnosed in 176 patients: 76 in group A and 100 in group B. The remaining ones, 13.3% and 11.2% respectively, received the second course of (131)I for remnant ablation. There were no statistically significant differences in Tg (thyroglobulin) serum level either 12 or 24 months after 131I treatment. CONCLUSION(S): Our evaluation of early efficacy of adjuvant radioiodine treatment in low risk DTC patients shows no differences between two radioiodine activities - 60 and 100 mCi in relation to thyroid ablation. Thus, the activity of 60 mCi is recommended.",Excluded

2265,"Clinical criteria for obtaining maxillofacial computed tomographic scans in trauma patients. BACKGROUND: Over 150,000 patients present with maxillofacial trauma annually to emergency rooms in the United States. Although maxillofacial computed tomography is a sensitive screening tool for identifying facial fractures, indiscriminate use leads to unnecessary radiation exposure and substantial costs. A decision instrument is needed to ensure computed tomographic evaluation of patients at high risk for facial fracture and limit computed tomography use in low-risk patients., METHODS: A retrospective review was conducted of all patients evaluated at a Level I trauma center over a 3-year period. Inclusion criteria were maxillofacial examination on presentation, maxillofacial computed tomography, and head computed tomography. A total of 525 patients met the enrollment criteria., RESULTS: Injury to the maxillofacial skeleton occurred in 332 patients (63.2 percent). The presence of any of the following five physical examination criteria identified patients at high risk for facial fracture: bony stepoff or instability, periorbital swelling or contusion, Glasgow Coma Scale score less than 14, malocclusion, or tooth absence. These criteria identified all but six of the 332 patients with a facial fracture (sensitivity, 98.2 percent; 95 percent confidence interval, 96.5 to 99.1 percent). The negative predictive value was 87.8 percent (95 percent confidence interval, 76.3 to 94.2 percent). No patient determined by these criteria to be at low risk for a facial fracture required surgical treatment. If these criteria had been applied to the study population, radiographic imaging could have been avoided in 9.3 percent of patients., CONCLUSIONS: A decision instrument based on clinical criteria can ensure appropriate screening of patients at high risk for facial fracture. Application of this instrument may reduce unnecessary maxillofacial imaging.",Excluded
136,"Routine computed tomography in the evaluation of vocal fold movement impairment without an apparent cause. OBJECTIVE: Routine computed tomography (CT) for vocal fold movement impairment (VFMI) without an apparent cause is common. However, given increased cancer risk associated with ionizing radiation exposure, our purpose is to evaluate the utility of routine scans for these patients., STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective case series., SETTING: Houston, Texas., SUBJECTS AND METHODS: A 5-year review of patients with VFMI diagnosed at an academic institution was conducted. For patients without an apparent cause (eg, recent head, neck, or cardiothoracic surgery or known malignancy), CT head/neck and chest was performed to evaluate the recurrent laryngeal nerve course. Data included demographics, symptoms, radiography, and interventions. Statistical analyses were performed via chi(2) analysis., RESULTS: Of 406 patients with VFMI, 47 (11%) patients had no apparent cause clinically. Routine CT revealed abnormalities in 10 (21%) patients, of which only 3 (6%) could account for VFMI: benign thyroid adenoma (1), papillary thyroid cancer (1), and an esophageal mass (1). The most common lesion detected involved the thyroid. Demographic data and symptom type were not significantly associated with detection of a VFMI-attributable lesion on CT. Overall, routine CT did not identify a focal etiology in 94% patients with VFMI without an apparent cause., CONCLUSION: Routine pan-CT evaluation failed to reveal an etiology in 94% of patients with VFMI without an apparent cause. Patients may be subjected to health risks associated with radiation exposure without significant diagnostic benefit. Further studies should consider more judicious use of CT in the context of risk factors and safer imaging modalities as the initial diagnostic step.

843,"Type of interventional pain procedure, body weight, and presence of spinal pathology are determinants of the level of radiation exposure for fluoroscopically guided pain procedures. In the recent years new technology has led to the development of a bewildering array of imaging procedures. Yet, conventional radiography remains one of the most used tools to diagnose and to aid procedural interventions. Fluoroscopy guidance facilitates targeted drug delivery or radiofrequency directly to the area of pathology, a benefit that has to be balanced against the risks of radiation exposure. In this prospective observational survey of routine practice, dose area product (DAP) and screening time (ST) were recorded in 127 consecutive patients undergoing fluoroscopically guided spinal procedures along with other probable measures of potentially greater radiation exposure such as weight, type of spinal pathology, the ease of recognition of the anatomical landmarks, and the radiographic quality of the image in terms of contrast and graininess. The mean ST was 34+/-27 seconds (range, 3 to 218 seconds), the mean DAP was 1.18+/-1.08 Gy cm(2) (range, 0.023 to 6.82 seconds). A correlation between weight and DAP was confirmed (r=0.230, P<0.05, Spearman's correlation coefficient). Patients with spinal pathology (n=33) had higher radiation exposure than those without (DAP median=0.85, U=978.00, P<0.005, r=-0.28, Mann-Whitney test). The DAP values obtained compare favourably with the recommended doses for radiographs and other procedures, although they generally exceed the values for a chest X-ray. Copyright © 2011 The Authors.

1844,"3D Printed Personalized Guide Plate in the Femoral Head Core Decompression. Objective. To investigate the feasibility of using 3D printed personalized guide plates in core decompression procedures for the treatment of osteonecrosis of the femoral head (ONFH). Methods. The clinical data of 8 patients undergoing femoral head core decompression from January to December 2019 were analyzed retrospectively. Three-dimensional (3D) images of the patients were reconstructed from the CT scan data taken preoperatively. From the data obtained, puncture position, drill hole, and depth were evaluated, and individualized 3D puncture guide plates were designed using Mimics 21.0 software. During the operation, the needle went through the hole of the guide plate, the depth of the drill was controlled, and the obtained bone tissues were sent for pathological evaluation. Intraoperative X-ray and postoperative pathological results were used to evaluate the success of the puncture. Results. The individualized guide plates used for core compression on the 8 patients were well fitted with the anatomic structure of the puncture site, and the direction and depth of the needle insertion were consistent with the preoperative design. The operation time was about 15-22 mins. The position of the decompression tunnel was the same as the designed plate. The postoperative pathology showed necrotic bone tissue. There were no postoperative complications such as infection, bleeding, and fracture. Conclusion. The 3D printed individualized guide plate can simplify core decompression and would make this procedure more accurate, safe, and quick, in addition to obtaining necrotic tissues for pathological examination.Copyright © 2020 Liangliang Cheng et al.",Excluded
2579,"Combined effects of glutathione S-transferase polymorphisms and thyroid cancer risk. Since exposure to ionizing radiation, a risk factor for thyroid cancer, may produce genotoxins potentially eliminated by glutathione-S-transferases, we conducted a case control study to evaluate the role of the GSTM1- and GSTT1-null genotypes and GSTP1 polymorphisms in thyroid cancer. The frequency of GSTP1 Ile/Ile, GSTM1-, and GSTT1-null genotypes was increased in cancer patients when compared with control population. Considering the genotypes over-represented in thyroid cancer patients as potential risk genotypes, we carried out an odds ratio (OR) analysis considering the presence of none, one, two, or three risk genotypes. The results obtained showed that the presence of three potentially risk alleles (GSTM1 null, GSTT1 null, and GSTP1 Ile/Ile) lead to a significant OR increase for all the cases, irrespective of the type of tumor (OR=2.91), for papillary (OR=3.64) but not for follicular tumors. The presence of GSTP1 Ile/Ile leads to a significant later age of tumor onset when compared with GSTP1 Ile/Val and Val/Val (P<0.05), suggesting a possible association between GSTP1 Ile/Ile and the age of disease manifestation. These results suggest that combined GST polymorphisms lead to a moderate increased risk for thyroid cancer, especially for the papillary type, and GSTP1 polymorphisms might modulate the age of onset of the disease.",Excluded
1408,"A Quantitative Assessment of Pre-Operative MRI Reports in Glioma Patients: Report Metrics and IDH Prediction Ability. Objectives: To measure the metrics of glioma pre-operative MRI reports and build IDH prediction models. Method(s): Pre-operative MRI reports of 144 glioma patients in a single institution were collected retrospectively. Words were transformed to lowercase letters. White spaces, punctuations, and stop words were removed. Stemming was performed. A word cloud method applied to processed text matrix visualized language behavior. Spearman's rank correlation assessed the correlation between the subjective descriptions of the enhancement pattern. The T1-contrast images associated with enhancement descriptions were selected. The keywords associated with IDH status were evaluated by chi2 value ranking. Random forest, k-nearest neighbors and Support Vector Machine algorithms were used to train models based on report features and age. All statistical analysis used two-tailed test with significance at p <.05. Result(s): Longer word counts occurred in reports of older patients, higher grade gliomas, and wild type IDH gliomas. We identified 30 glioma enhancement descriptions, eight of which were commonly used: peripheral, heterogeneous, irregular, nodular, thick, rim, large, and ring. Five of eight patterns were correlated. IDH mutant tumors were characterized by words related to normal, symmetric or negative findings. IDH wild type tumors were characterized words by related to pathological MR findings like enhancement, necrosis and FLAIR foci. An integrated KNN model based on report features and age demonstrated high-performance (AUC: 0.89, 95% CI: 0.88-0.90). Conclusion(s): Report length depended on age, glioma grade, and IDH status. Description of glioma enhancement was varied. Report descriptions differed for IDH wild and mutant gliomas. Report features can be used to predict glioma IDH status.© Copyright © 2021 Cao, Erson-Omay, Gunel, Moliterno and Fulbright.",Excluded

89,"Treatment of type I endoleaks using transcatheter embolization with onyx. Purpose: To report a single-center experience with transcatheter embolization of type I endoleaks using the liquid embolic agent Onyx, an ethylene vinyl alcohol copolymer. Method(s): Eight patients (4 men; mean age 74.8 years, range 63-86) with 10 type I endoleaks (6 abdominal and 4 thoracic) diagnosed 2 days to 9 years after endovascular repair were treated with Onyx embolization because cuff extension was precluded by an insufficient landing zone in 6 cases and an unsuitable aortic diameter in 2. Endoleaks were accessed with a 4-F diagnostic catheter and a coaxially introduced dimethylsulfoxide- compatible microcatheter. Onyx-34 was predominantly applied due to its high viscosity; patent side branches were coil embolized prior to Onyx delivery in 3 cases. Result(s): Technical success of the procedure was achieved in all cases. The mean volume of Onyx used for abdominal endoleaks was 11.8 mL (range 3.0-25.5) and 19.4 mL (range 4.5- 31.5) for thoracic endoleaks. The average duration of the procedure was 76.7 minutes (range 34.5-110.6), and the average radiation dose area product was 18.8 cGy*cm2 (range 10.6-55.8). Reperfusion of the endoleak was detected in one case 2 days after the procedure. A second case showed an occluded endoleak but a small trace of contrast between the aortic wall and the stent-graft. Non-target embolization was not found in any case. Mean follow-up was 13.2 months (range 8-24). The mean reduction in diameters for thoracic aneurysms after 6 and 12 months was 0.4 and 0.9 cm, respectively, and 0.6 and 1.2 cm, respectively, for abdominal aneurysms. Conclusion(s): Transcatheter embolization of type I endoleaks using Onyx is a simple, safe, and sustainable treatment option with a high primary success rate for cases in which stentgraft extension is not possible. The benefit of additional coil embolization remains uncertain. © 2014 by the INTERNATIONAL SOCIETY OF ENDOVASCULAR SPECIALISTS.",Excluded

The selected AEC strength curve applied to ""slim"" patients (diameter <32 cm estimated from the attenuation automatically measured on the topogram) was ""average"" and ""very strong"" in hospital A and hospital B, respectively. Two radiologists with 13 and 24 years of experience scored the image quality of the lung parenchyma and the mediastinum on a 5-point scale. The patients' effective diameter, the delivered CT dose index volume, and dose-length products were recorded., RESULTS: A total of 410 patients were included. The average body mass index was 24.0 kg/m in hospital A and 24.8 kg/m in hospital B. There was no significant difference between hospitals with respect to age, sex ratio, weight, height, body mass index, effective diameters, and image quality scores for each radiologist (P ranging from 0.050 to 1.000). The mean CT dose index volume for the entire population was 2.0 mGy and was significantly lower in hospital B with the ""very strong"" AEC curve as compared with hospital A (-11%, P=0.001). The mean dose-length product delivered in this 70 kg-weight population was 68 mGy cm, corresponding to an effective dose of 0.95 mSv., CONCLUSION: Changing the AEC strength curve from ""average"" to ""very strong"" for slim patients maintains image quality and reduces the radiation dose to <1 mSv in routine chest CT examinations reconstructed with filtered back-projection techniques.",Excluded

Introduction: Limited data establish the efficacy and safety of SBRT in the abdominopelvic (AP) space, where SBRT delivery is challenging due to the proximity of radiosensitive luminal gastrointestinal (GI) organs. The aim of this study was to assess clinical outcomes in patients with AP OM treated with SBRT. Method(s): Eligible patients were those with OM (defined as metastases in <=3 total sites) in the AP space (excluding liver) treated with SBRT. Descriptive statistics and Kaplan-Meier estimates of (LC), progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS) and chemotherapy-free survival (CFS) were performed. Result(s): Fifty-one patients with 58 AP OM received SBRT between 2011 and 2015. Median follow-up was 21.9 months. All SBRT treatments were delivered in 5 fractions with a median dose of 35 Gy (25-40 Gy). Progression post-SBRT occurred in 38/51 patients (75%), with a median PFS of 4.9 months (95% CI: 2.5-7.5), and 2-year PFS of 29%. Rates of 2-and 4-year LC were 74% and 69%, respectively. Median OS was 42.6 months (95% CI: 31-55). Oligometastatic progression occurred in 21/38 patients, and of those, 48% (10/21) received further SBRT.

1026,"Peritumoral inflammatory reaction in non-melanoma skin cancers - histological and immunohistochemical study. Non-melanoma skin cancers (NMSCs) are the most frequent types of cancer in white skin populations, all over the world. In the last 40 years, there was observed a rapid increase of their incidence, because of the UV radiations exposure and weather changes. Although its morbidity is a relatively modest one, the direct social costs of NMSCs are quite substantial due to a high incidence. Due to these reasons, numerous studies try to clarify the etiopathogenic mechanisms of NMSCs, to elaborate treatment and prevention measures. In the last years, a special attention was given to the relation between inflammation and skin cancer. In our study, we performed a histological and immunohistological evaluation of the inflammatory reaction on a number of 73 surgical exeresis pieces coming from the patients diagnosed with NMSCs. Of these, 21 were squamous cell carcinomas (SCCs) and 52 basal cell carcinomas (BCCs). The peritumoral inflammatory reaction in NMSCs was an extremely variable one in intensity and distribution, from one case to another and even from one area to another within the same tumor, thus proving the complexity of the relations between tumor cells and the cells of the immune system. By comparing the intensity of the inflammatory reaction between the two main types of NMSCs, there was observed that in SCCs the inflammatory reaction was more intense in comparison to BCCs. Also, in SCC there was highlighted a more abundant inflammatory infiltrate in poorly differentiated carcinomas, in comparison to the well-differentiated ones. The presence of the immune system cells (T-lymphocytes, macrophages, mast cells) among the tumoral cells, in a direct contact with these, makes us believe that between the two categories of cells there may appear mechanisms of intercellular communication, distinct from the mechanisms of paracrine signaling.",Excluded

Background Osteoporosis responsible for loss of bone strength and vertebral fracture (VF) rates ranged from 0% to 18% have been reported in patients with ankylosing spondylitis (AS). Objectives In this study we examined the prevalence of low bone mineral density (BMD) and VF in patients with AS (modified New York criteria), and investigated the associations between BMD or VF and demographic, body composition or disease-related parameters. Methods Skeletal and body composition assessment included dual X-ray Absortiometry (DXA) at the lumbar spine, hip and total body and radiographs of the spine. The presence of VF was established by the Genant's semi-quantitative method. Results A total of 79 AS patients, 65 males and 14 females with mean age of 43 and 49 years, respectively and with a mean disease duration of 10 years were included. Mean Z score BMD (SD below the age- and gender-matched mean reference value) were slightly decreased only in male patients, both at lumbar spine and total hip (-0,4 p=0,05; -0,3 p<0,01), while mean total body Z score BMD were positive in both genders (female +1,2 p<0,05; male +0,7 p<0,001), independent of the presence of syndesmophytes. Z score BMD values at both total hip and lumbar spine were directly and significantly (p<0.01) associated with body mass index (BMI, Kg/m2); Z score BMD were significantly correlated with both fat and lean mass (kg), measured by DXA, only at hip sites. Z score BMD were significantly lower in the 36 patients with syndesmophytes and in those (19%) with peripheral joints involvement. Despite reasonably preserved BMD values at least one VF was identified in 31% of males and 14% of females; most VF were located at thoracic-lumbar transition and were mild wedge fractures. The presence of VF was not associated with BMD values (ANOVA) but rather with peripheral joints involvement (chi-square test, p<0.01), Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Metrology Index (logistic regression, p<0,01), and Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Functional Index (p<0,01). Conclusions In this study we found that BMD is relatively well preserved in AS patients. The total body BMD values above the normal range suggest that the overall bone formation might be somewhat increased despite the propensity to decreased mobility. VF are very common particularly in male AS patients: its occurrence is unrelated with BMD values while it is significantly correlated with clinical parameters of disease activity and functional impairment.",Excluded

Median dose of 82 gray (80-86gy) was planned on retrogasserian target close to pars triangularis using single isocenter multiarc non-coplanar beams on a Monte-Carlo optimizer. Treatment was delivered using 5mm stereotactic cones with FFF beams at dose rate of 1200mu/mt, 3-D CBCT image guidance, intrafraction imaging and 6-DOF couch. All patients underwent serial MR imaging at time points 72 hrs, 1 week, 1 mo, 3 mo, 6 mo, & 12 mo post SRS. Targeting accuracy was assessed from deviation of the coordinates of the intended target compared with the center of enhancement on 1 month post-SRS MRI. Radiation dose delivered at the borders of contrast enhancement was evaluated. ""Favorable"" responders were patients rendered free of pain, either with or without medications. Complications were defined as lasting neurologic deficits attributable to treatment, and included anesthesia, paresthesia or dysesthesia. Result(s): At median follow-up of 14 mo. pain relief was complete in 13 patients with BNI class 1 response (no medication) and 2 patients BNI had class 2 response (occasional pain not requiring medication). The actuarial rate of obtaining complete pain relief was 93.3%. Imaging changes were same in all the patients post radiosurgery. Nerve edema is seen at 72 hrs post treatment, minimal brainstem edema (nearby DREZ) is noted at 7 days post treatment. Focal enhancement corresponding to SRS shot is seen at 1 month. The enhancement persisted through 6mon. scan but the brainstem edema decreased to pretreatment levels. At 12mo. MR the enhancement faded in intensity. The median deviation of the coordinates between the intended target and the center of contrast enhancement was 0.5 mm (0.3-0.7mm) in Euclidean space. The median radiation doses fitting within the borders of the contrast enhancement of the shot ranged from 78gy. Conclusion(s): Warping original treatment doses on the 1 month post SRS postcontrast MRI gives the clinical team an idea about the accuracy of the treatment and accordingly the errors in treatment.

Purpose: In reported retrospective non-randomized trials of treatment of esophageal carcinoma, blacks have a lower survival from esophageal cancer than whites. None of these studies has accounted for the extent of disease, or the methods and quality of treatment. We reviewed the data that included only patients treated on the chemoradiation arm of the RTOG-8501 esophageal carcinoma trial to see if there were differences in overall survival between black and white patients receiving the same standard of care. Methods and Materials: One hundred-nineteen patients, 37 blacks and 82 whites were evaluated who met the criteria for receiving chemoradiation of 5000 cGy and four courses of Cisplatin (75 mg/m2) and Fluorouracil (1000 mg/m2 for 4 days). Result(s): Blacks had squamous histology only, with 86% of blacks having weight loss of 10 lbs. or more compared to 56% of whites (p = 0.001). In addition, blacks had larger tumors and more difficulty eating (p = 0.010). Overall, there was no difference in the Kaplan-Meier median survival estimate by race (p = 0.2757). Only when we limited the analysis to the 'squamous histology' subgroup, stratified according to age >70 vs. <70 years (p = 0.0002), and nodal status (p = 0.0177) in a Cox regression model analysis, did race appear to be a significant factor (p = 0.0012). However, using the entire database, the age effect was found to be a 'bimodal' effect, wherein the 'youngest' ( 70 years) did poorly. Because of the dramatic differences in the age and histology distributions between blacks and whites, this issue could not be resolved in the subset of squamous only who received chemoradiation. Conclusion(s): The increasing incidence of adenocarcinoma among white patients without a corresponding increase of this histology in blacks reflects a difference in diet and or lifestyle compared to blacks that deserves additional study. When treated aggressively with chemoradiation, race did not appear to be a statistically significant factor for overall survival.",Excluded
2830,"Doses to carotid arteries after modern radiation therapy for hodgkin lymphoma: Is stroke still a late effect of treatment?. Purpose Hodgkin lymphoma (HL) survivors are at an increased risk of stroke because of carotid artery irradiation. However, for early-stage HL involved node radiation therapy (INRT) reduces the volume of normal tissue exposed to high doses. Here, we evaluate 3-dimensional conformal radiation therapy (3D-CRT), volumetric-modulated arc therapy (VMAT), and proton therapy (PT) delivered as INRT along with the extensive mantle field (MF) by comparing doses to the carotid arteries and corresponding risk estimates. Methods and Materials We included a cohort of 46 supradiaphragmatic stage I-II classical HL patients. All patients were initially treated with chemotherapy and INRT delivered as 3D-CRT (30 Gy). For each patient, we simulated MF (36 Gy) and INRT plans using VMAT and PT (30 Gy). Linear dose-response curves for the 20-, 25-, and 30-year risk of stroke were derived from published HL data. Risks of stroke with each technique were calculated for all patients. Statistical analyses were performed with repeated measures analysis of variance. Results The mean doses to the right and left common carotid artery were significantly lower with modern treatment compared with MF, with substantial patient variability. The estimated excess risk of stroke after 20, 25, and 30 years was 0.6%, 0.86%, and 1.3% for 3D-CRT; 0.67%, 0.96%, and 1.47% for VMAT; 0.61%, 0.96%, and 1.33% for PT; and 1.3%, 1.72%, and 2.61% for MF. Conclusions INRT reduces the dose delivered to the carotid arteries and corresponding estimated risk of stroke for HL survivors. Even for the subset of patients with lymphoma close to the carotid arteries, the estimated risk is low. © 2013 Elsevier Inc.",Excluded
3567,"Feasibility of low radiation dose retrospectively-gated cardiac CT for functional analysis in adult congenital heart disease. BACKGROUND: The use of cardiac computed tomography (CT) in the evaluation of adult congenital heart disease patients is limited due to concerns of high radiation doses. The purpose of this study was to prospectively assess whether low radiation dose cardiac CT is feasible to evaluate ventricular systolic function in adults with congenital heart disease., METHODS: The study group included 30 consecutive patients with significant congenital heart disease who underwent a total of 35 ECG-gated cardiac CT scans utilizing a 320-detector row CT scanner. Each study included a non-contrast scan and subsequent contrast-enhanced retrospectively-gated acquisition. Effective radiation dose was estimated by multiplying the dose length product by a k-factor of 0.014mSv/mGycm., RESULTS: The mean age of the patients was 34.4+/-8.9years, 60% were men, and mean body mass index was 24.2+/-4.3kg/m2. A majority of patients (n=28, 93.3%) had contraindications to cardiac MRI. A tube potential of 80kV was used in 27 (77.1%) of the contrast-enhanced scans. The mean signal-to-noise and contrast-to-noise ratios were 11.5+/-3.9 and 10.3+/-3.7, respectively. The median radiation dose for non-contrast and contrast-enhanced images were 0.1mSv (0.07-0.2mSv) and 0.94mSv (0.5-2.1mSv), respectively. All 35 CT scans were successfully analyzed for ventricular systolic function., CONCLUSIONS: A low radiation contrast-enhanced, retrospectively-gated cardiac CT with a median radiation dose of less than 1mSv was successful in evaluating ventricular systolic function in 30 consecutive adult congenital heart disease patients who underwent a total of 35 scans.

3109,"Evaluation of a novel normal database with matched SPECT systems and optimal pre-filter parameters for 3D-SSP. PURPOSE: A normal perfusion database (NDB) is imperative for the statistical imaging of brain function. This study validates a novel NDB created under the same injection dose and acquisition conditions for three gamma camera systems and evaluates optimal pre-filter parameters for three-dimensional stereotactic surface projections (3D-SSPs)., METHOD: We compared a novel NDB that matched the databases in each of three vendor gamma camera systems with a conventionally constructed NDB (conventional NDB) and a NDB constructed in-house for 3D-SSP. We generated hypoperfused regions where pre-specified volumes were simulated for various areas in SPECT images. The properties of each NDB were evaluated based on the distribution of the standard deviation (SD). Abnormal accumulation regions were validated using Z, extent, and artifactual scores. Detection error was used to evaluate the optimal Butterworth pre-filter cutoff frequency with the perfusion defect rate (PDR) in 3D-SSP., RESULTS: The SD distribution was the same in the novel NDB and in the NDB constructed in-house, and the SD of the peak distribution was 0.08-0.07. The Z and extent scores of the novel DB and the NDB constructed in-house were similar, but increased along with the artifactual scores when using the conventional NDB. Many artifacts appeared in the Z score map when using the conventional NDB. The detection error deviated from the actual value by -1.3% at a cutoff frequency of 0.58 cycles/cm and a PDR of 30%, which was the lowest. The cutoff frequency became lower or higher, and the low-perfusion defect rate increased according to the increasing detection error. The optimal cutoff frequency was between 0.52 and 0.58 cycles/cm., CONCLUSIONS: We generated a novel NDB according to the individual devices and compared it with a conventional and a NDB constructed in-house. The Z and extent scores were essentially equal when using the novel DB and the NDB constructed in-house, but considerably differed when using the conventional NDB. The optimal cutoff frequency of the Butterworth filter evaluated from the detection error was in the range of 0.52-0.58 cycles/cm. The detection error increased the perfusion defect rate by <15% and this was undetectable in 3D-SSP. The next step will be to improve the accuracy of the extent of abnormal regions and the sensitivity of the Z score using a novel NDB constructed according to the individual devices.",Excluded
2343,"Gamma band oscillations reveal neural network cortical coherence dysfunction in schizophrenia patients. BACKGROUND: Gamma band activity has been associated with many sensory and cognitive functions, and is important for cortico-cortical transmission and the integration of information across neural networks. The aims of the present study were to determine if schizophrenia patients have deficits in the generation and maintenance of coherent, synchronized oscillations in response to steady-state stimulation, and to examine the clinical and cognitive correlates of the electroencephalography (EEG) oscillatory dynamics., METHODS: Schizophrenia patients (n = 100) and nonpsychiatric subjects (n = 80) underwent auditory steady-state event-related potential testing. Click trains varying in rate of stimulation (20, 30, and 40 Hz) were presented; EEG-evoked power and intertrial phase synchronization were obtained in response to each stimulation frequency. Subjects also underwent clinical and neurocognitive assessments., RESULTS: Patients had reductions in both evoked power and phase synchronization in response to 30- and 40-Hz stimulation but normal responsivity to 20-Hz stimulation. Maximal deficits were detected in response to 40-Hz stimulation. A modest association of reduced working memory performance and 40-Hz intertrial phase synchronization was present in schizophrenia patients (r = .32, p <.01)., CONCLUSIONS: Schizophrenia patients have frequency-specific deficits in the generation and maintenance of coherent gamma-range oscillations, reflecting a fundamental degradation of basic integrated neural network activity.",Excluded
1578,"Ancillary effect of three-dimensional printing technology applied in the orthopedic surgery of severe rigid kyphoscoliosis. BACKGROUND: For severe rigid kyphoscoliosis patients, due to severe spinal deformity, and high risk for orthopedic surgery, designing an individualized and precise placement and osteotomy scheme preoperatively is needed to reduce surgery risk. OBJECTIVE(S): To evaluate the clinical effect of three-dimensional (3D) printing applied in the orthopedic surgery for severe rigid kyphoscoliosis. METHOD(S): Thirty-two patients with severe rigid kyphoscoliosis from January 2015 to June 2017 were included. Sixteen cases underwent 3D-assisted osteotomy (preoperative spinal reconstruction by 3D printing, and designing rational osteotomy scheme, trial group), and other 16 cases received orthopedic surgery under X-ray (control group). The perioperative indexes, postoperative correction effect, accuracy of pedicle screw placement and incidence of complications were recorded. RESULTS AND CONCLUSION(S): The operation time, intraoperative blood loss, intraoperative fluoroscopy time, postoperative drainage, postoperative incidence of complications, postoperative scoliosis and kyphosis Cobb angle in the trial group were significantly lower than those in the control group, but the accuracy of pedicle screw placement, scoliosis and kyphosis corrective rate were significantly higher than those in the control group (P < 0.05). To conclude, based on 3D printing, an individualized and precise placement and osteotomy scheme is designed for severe rigid kyphoscoliosis, can improve the operation safety, reduce the trauma, and obtain satisfactory clinical outcomes.Copyright © 2018, Journal of Clinical Rehabilitative Tissue Engineering Research.

3016,"Kruppel-like Factor 5 Regulates Stemness, Lineage Specification, and Regeneration of Intestinal Epithelial Stem Cells. Background & Aims: Self-renewal and multipotent differentiation are cardinal properties of intestinal stem cells (ISCs), mediated in part by WNT and NOTCH signaling. Although these pathways are well characterized, the molecular mechanisms that control the 'stemness' of ISCs are still not well defined. Here, we investigated the role of Kruppel-like factor 5 (KLF5) in regulating ISC functions. Method(s): We performed studies in adult Lgr5EGFP-IRES-creERT2;Rosa26LSLtdTomato (Lgr5Ctrl) and Lgr5EGFP-IRES-creERT2;Klf5fl/fl;Rosa26LSLtdTomato (Lgr5DELTAKlf5) mice. Mice were injected with tamoxifen to activate Cre recombinase, which deletes Klf5 from the intestinal epithelium in Lgr5DELTAKlf5 but not Lgr5Crtl mice. In experiments involving irradiation, mice were subjected to 12 Gy total body irradiation (TBI). Tissues were collected for immunofluorescence (IF) analysis and next generation sequencing. Oganoids were derived from fluoresecence activated cell sorted- (FACS-) single cells from tamoxifen-treated Lgr5DELTAKlf5 or Lgr5Crtl mice and examined by immunofluorescence stain. Result(s): Lgr5+ ISCs lacking KLF5 proliferate faster than control ISCs but fail to self-renew, resulting in a depleted ISC compartment. Transcriptome analysis revealed that Klf5-null Lgr5+ cells lose ISC identity and prematurely differentiate. Following irradiation injury, which depletes Lgr5+ ISCs, reserve Klf5-null progenitor cells fail to dedifferentiate and regenerate the epithelium. Absence of KLF5 inactivates numerous selected enhancer elements and direct transcriptional targets including canonical WNT- and NOTCH-responsive genes. Analysis of human intestinal tissues showed increased levels of KLF5 in the regenerating epithelium as compared to those of healthy controls. Conclusion(s): We conclude that ISC self-renewal, lineage specification, and precursor dedifferentiation require KLF5, by its ability to regulate epigenetic and transcriptional activities of ISC-specific gene sets. These findings have the potential for modulating ISC functions by targeting KLF5 in the intestinal epithelium.Copyright © 2020 The Authors",Excluded
583,"Radiation-related cranial nerve palsy in patients with nasopharyngeal carcinoma. BACKGROUND: Cranial nerve palsy is a rare complication after patients with nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) receive radiotherapy using a technique that delivers 180-200 centigrays (cGy) per day. Cranial neuropathy is of particular clinical interest in terms of making a differential diagnosis, because it is also a common presenting manifestation in patients with NPC. Cranial neuropathy may lead to distressing signs and symptoms in these patients, and their treatment has not been addressed in previous reports. This article presents the authors' experience with radiotherapy-related cranial nerve palsy in patients with NPC., METHODS: Nineteen patients were diagnosed with radiation-related neuropathy. Patients with recurrent tumors or with a suspicion of persistent or recurrent tumors were excluded. Most patients were treated using 180 cGy or 200 cGy per fraction per day. The total dose was 7000-13,000 cGy to the nasopharynx and 5000-9000 cGy to the neck. Unilateral vocal cord paralysis alone and hearing loss were not included in the analysis., RESULTS: There were 15 male patients and 4 female patients. The latency before palsy occurred was 12-240 months. Single nerve palsy developed in four patients, including two patients with hypoglossal palsy and two patients with recurrent laryngeal palsy. Two patients had three nerve palsies each. The other 13 patients presented with 2 nerve palsies each. Vagus and hypoglossal palsy appeared to be a frequent combination and occurred in 11 patients. Overall, there were 17 patients with hypoglossal palsy (7 bilateral, 8 left-sided, and 2 right-sided), 11 patients with vagus palsy (2 bilateral, 7 left-sided, and 2 right-sided), 6 patients with recurrent laryngeal nerve palsy (5 bilateral), and 2 patients with accessory palsies (all bilateral). Marked neck fibrosis was present in 12 patients. Patients who had vocal cord paralysis suffered from easy choking and hoarseness. Severe respiratory difficulty occurred in two patients who had bilateral vocal cord palsy. Surgical procedures included laryngoplasty, tracheostomy, and gastrostomy. Quality of life improved considerably after patients underwent surgery., CONCLUSIONS: Radiotherapy-related cranial nerve palsy may occur in patients with NPC after they receive conventional radiotherapy. Hypoglossal nerve palsy was found the most frequently in this series, followed by vagus nerve palsy and recurrent laryngeal nerve palsy. Neck fibrosis and the course of the three nerves through the neck may be important risk factors for the development of palsy. The diagnosis must be made only after the possibilities of tumor-induced palsy and idiopathic palsy are excluded. Surgery is helpful in improving the quality of life in many patients.

308,"Exogenous T3 mimics long day lengths in Siberian hamsters. Siberian hamsters (Phodopus sungorus) exhibit seasonal cycles of reproduction driven by changes in day length. Day length is encoded endogenously by the duration of nocturnal melatonin (Mel) secretion from the pineal gland. Short-duration Mel signals stimulate reproduction and long-duration signals inhibit reproduction. The mechanism by which Mel signals are decoded at the level of neural target tissues remains uncharacterized. In Siberian hamsters, exposure to short day lengths or injections of Mel in long days results in a decrease in hypothalamic expression of type 2 iodothyronine deiodinase (Dio2) mRNA. Dio2 catalyzes the conversion of the thyroid hormone thyroxine to triiodothyronine (T3). Thus exposure to short and long day lengths should decrease and increase hypothalamic T3 concentrations, respectively. We tested the hypothesis that exogenous T3 administered to short-day hamsters would mimic exposure to long day lengths with respect to gonadal stimulation. Hamsters gestated and raised in short day lengths that exhibited photoinhibition of the testes were given daily subutaneous injections of T3 or saline vehicle for 4 wk beginning at week 12 of life. The results indicate that exogenous T3 induced gonadal growth in short-day hamsters and delayed spontaneous gonadal development by an interval equal to the number of weeks during which T3 was administered. T3 injections delayed gonadal regression if given coincident with the transfer of hamsters from long to short day lengths. These results suggest that T3 mimics long day exposure in Siberian hamsters and may serve as an intermediate step between the Mel rhythm and the reproductive response.",Excluded

1386,"Precise determination of the erythema response of human skin to ultraviolet radiation and quantification of effects of protectors. BACKGROUND: We describe highly reproducible methods for quantifying the erythema response of precisely selected areas (spots) of human skin to graded doses of ultraviolet radiation (UVR). These methods have permitted evaluation of the efficacy of protectors, such as sulforaphane from crucifers, that defend cells through induction of cytoprotective (phase 2) genes., METHODS: Spots on the back were precisely located by opaque, adhesive, vinyl templates provided with 16 circular, 2.0 cm diameter occludable windows. Doses (100-800 mJ/cm(2)) of narrow-band (311 nm) UVR were administered, and the erythema index (a(*)) was measured with a chromometer on treated and control areas, before and after radiation., RESULTS: Daily variations in basal a(*) values of each spot were much smaller than the differences of a(*) values among spots of one individual, or those of corresponding spots among different individuals. The increments in erythema responses to UVR (Delta a(*)) were similar despite large variations of basal a(*) of spots. The most appropriate measure of UVR-evoked erythema is therefore the Delta a(*) value for each spot, which is an independent observational entity. Delta a(*) was proportional to UVR dose, and independent of spot location. To evaluate effectiveness of protectors against UVR damage we paired horizontally adjacent spots for treatment and controls. Vertical or random spot pairing did not provide significantly higher consistency. Protective efficacy against UVR erythema is appropriately expressed as percent reduction in Delta a(*) values upon treatment with inducers., CONCLUSIONS: The protection of skin against UVR damage can be quantified precisely from changes in erythema index (Delta a(*)) obtained with a chromometer.",Excluded

Background: To evaluate the safety and efficacy of particle therapy (PT) using pencil beam scanning (PBS) technique for early stage non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Method(s): From 08/2014 to 03/2018, 31 consecutive patients with sum of the longest diameters of primary tumor and hilar lymph node < 5 cm, N0-1, M0 NSCLC treated with PT were retrospectively analyzed. Gating/active breathing control techniques were used to control tumor motion in 20 and 7 patients. PBS-based proton radiotherapy (PRT) or carbon ion radiotherapy (CIRT) plans were designed via Syngo planning system. PRT, PRT + CIRT boost, and CIRT were used in 6, 6 and 19 patients, respectively. Prescriptions were categorized to 3 levels: 5-7.5 GyE*8-10 Fx, 4-5 GyE*15-16 Fx and 2.25-3.5 GyE*20-31 Fx. Result(s): Thirty-one patients (20 males and 11 females) with a median age of 71 (50-80) years were enrolled with a median follow-up time of 12.1 (2.9-45.2) months. Fourteen were adenocarcinomas, 7 squamous cell carcinomas, 4 non-specified NSCLC and 6 had no histological diagnosis (4/6 had previous resected lung cancer). The median tumor size was 3.1 (1.1-4.7) cm. No grade 4-5 toxicities were observed. One patient experienced grade 3 (per the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events version 4.03) radiation-induced lung injury (RILI) at 6.7 months from radiation started. Grade 2 acute toxicities included hematological toxicities (5 cases), RILI (2), plural pain (1) and dermatitis (1). Grade 2 late toxicities included RILI (3) and asymptomatic rib fracture (1). Three patients had progressed disease at 4.0~10.6 months after the initiation of PT. One experienced local failure with simultaneous distant failure and died of brain metastasis at 10.8 months; one developed regional and distant failure and died of lung infection at 8.7 months; the other experienced isolated distant failure only and his disease was well controlled after salvage systemic therapy. The estimated rates of progression-free survival, local control, cause-specific survival and overall survival at 1, 2 years were 85.5% and 85.5%, 95.2% and 95.2%, 95.0% and 95.0%, 90.7% and 90.7%, respectively.

2387,"[Plaque radiotherapy for anterior uveal melanomas]. AIM: To determine the effectiveness of plaque radiation therapy for anterior uveal melanomas and to evaluate the risk and frequency of complications at different time intervals after the treatment., MATERIAL AND METHODS: During 2010-2013 a total of 30 patients (10 male, 20 female) aged 11-73 (50 years on the average) with iris or iridociliary melanomas were treated with Ru-106 and Sr-90 ophthalmic plaques. In 8 patients the brachytherapy was preceded by local tumor excision. Morphological diagnosis was verified in 10 patients (8 iridectomies, 2 enucleations), of them 8 cases turned out to be spindle cell melanomas and the other 2--mixed cell melanomas. Follow-up period ranged from 1 to 54 months with the median of 13,5 months., RESULTS: Tumor regression was achieved in all cases. Enucleation had to be performed in 2 patients due to cornea and sclera necrosis. In the early post-brachytherapy period (up to 1 month) the most frequent radiation-related complications were keratopathy and uveitis (8 and 6 patients correspondingly). In patients observed for up to 3 months (28 patients) these were keratopathy and cataract (8 and 5 patients correspondingly). In the long-term (over 6 months) cataract predominated (17 patients). At the end of the study all patients were alive. Metastatic disease was diagnosed in one patient 30 months after the treatment., CONCLUSIONS: The results of the present clinical study confirm the effectiveness of brachytherapy for iris and iridociliary melanomas, which implies that tumor is well locally controlled and radiation-related complications are moderate and curable. This method of local tumor destruction can be another alternative to enucleation in cases when local tumor excision cannot be performed.",Excluded
3310,"Assessing Sensorimotor Function Following ISS with Computerized Dynamic Posturography. INTRODUCTION: Postflight postural ataxia reflects both the control strategies adopted for movement in microgravity and the direct effects of deconditioning. Computerized dynamic posturography (CDP) has been used during the first decade of the International Space Station (ISS) expeditions to quantify the initial postflight decrements and recovery of postural stability., METHODS: The CDP data were obtained on 37 crewmembers as part of their pre- and postflight medical examinations. Sensory organization tests evaluated the ability to make effective use of (or suppress inappropriate) visual, vestibular, and somatosensory information for balance control. This report focuses on eyes closed conditions with either a fixed or sway-referenced base of support, with the head erect or during pitch-head tilts (+/- 20degree at 0.33 Hz). Equilibrium scores were derived from peak-to-peak anterior-posterior sway. Motor-control tests were also used to evaluate a crewmember's ability to automatically recover from unexpected support-surface perturbations., RESULTS: The standard Romberg condition was the least sensitive. Dynamic head tilts led to increased incidence of falls and revealed significantly longer recovery than head-erect conditions. Improvements in postflight postural performance during the later expeditions may be attributable to higher preflight baselines and/or advanced exercise capabilities aboard the ISS., CONCLUSIONS: The diagnostic assessment of postural instability is more pronounced during unstable-support conditions requiring active head movements. In addition to supporting return-to-duty decisions by flight surgeons, the CDP provides a standardized sensorimotor measure that can be used to evaluate the effectiveness of countermeasures designed to either minimize deconditioning on orbit or promote reconditioning upon return to Earth.",Excluded
2642,"Posterior capsule opacification severity, assessed with straylight measurement, as main indicator of early visual function deterioration. PURPOSE: To study the effect of posterior capsule opacification (PCO) morphology and severity on different aspects of visual function (VF): the small-angle domain (visual acuity [VA], contrast sensitivity [CS]) and large-angle domain (straylight; logarithm of the straylight parameter s [log{s}]). To evaluate whether straylight is a valuable additional indicator for appropriate posterior capsulotomy referral., DESIGN: Prospective, comparative study., PARTICIPANTS AND CONTROLS: For the study population, 240 pseudophakic eyes with PCO and a capsulotomy indication were selected. For the reference population, 99 pseudophakic eyes without PCO were selected., METHODS: The relation between PCO morphology and PCO severity and the precapsulotomy and postcapsulotomy logarithm of the minimum angle of resolution (logMAR), logarithm of CS (log[CS]), and log(s) values were determined. The PCO severity was assessed with retroillumination using evaluation of posterior capsule opacification (EPCO) software. Precapsulotomy logMAR and log(s) values were used to predict functionally significant logMAR and log(s) improvement after capsulotomy., MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The logMAR, log(CS), and log(s) improvements of >=0.20 log units were considered functionally significant (i.e., treatment effect). Precapsulotomy logMAR and log(s) values, above which a treatment effect (improvement>=0.20 log units) can be expected with >=50% probability, were determined and called cutoff values., RESULTS: Postcapsulotomy VF improvement was related to precapsulotomy VF values: Postcapsulotomy improvement was largest in cases with substantially impaired precapsulotomy VF parameters. Visual function deterioration was related to PCO severity rather than PCO morphology. The PCO severity (EPCO score) assessed with retroillumination has a progressive, linear relation with log(s) and a curvilinear relation with logMAR. Reflected light examination is expected to overestimate functional PCO severity. The precapsulotomy cutoff value was >=1.44 for log(s) and >=0.21 for logMAR., CONCLUSIONS: The linear relation between retroillumination PCO severity and log(s) indicates that log(s) is sensitive to low PCO severity, whereas the curvilinear relation between PCO severity and logMAR indicates that logMAR is unaffected by low PCO severity. Straylight is a sensitive, additional indicator for capsulotomy referral, especially in less severe cases of PCO. In ophthalmic practice, the precapsulotomy log(s) cutoff value of 1.44 can be used as an indicator for beneficial capsulotomy referral., FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE(S): The author(s) have no proprietary or commercial interest in any materials discussed in this article.

2027,"The treatment of movement disorders using gamma knife stereotactic radiosurgery. GK radiosurgical thalamotomy is an effective and useful alternative to invasive radiofrequency techniques for patients at high surgical risk. The mechanical accuracy of the gamma unit combined with the anatomical accuracy of high-resolution MR imaging makes radiosurgical lesioning safe and precise. Higher radiosurgical doses are more effective than lower ones at eliminating or reducing tremor and are without complications. The results from radiosurgical pallidotomy have been disappointing compared to those of gamma thalamotomy. A 50% complication rate in the former (homonymous field cuts, hemipareses, and dysphagias) combined with a poor success rate has led us to re-evaluate the indications for this procedure in the face of the excellent results obtained from radiofrequency pallidotomy with physiological monitoring. Perhaps lowered radiosurgical prescription doses can improve the complication rate. Anatomically, there appears to be a different sensitivity of the pallidum to radiation than that of the thalamus. Age-related or anatomy-related susceptible blood supply to the area may lead to hypoxia after single-fraction radiosurgery in a nuclear complex known to be especially susceptible to hypoxia. In addition, varying levels of iron deposition within the pallidum may catalyze free radical formation in the elderly only to be further exacerbated by tissue hypoxia.

Movement disorder is characterized by unique, unusual movements that are repetitive, and involuntary cervical motion has been well established to cause cervical spondylosis. The purpose of this study was to investigate the management of neurological and orthopedic complications in patients with movement disorder induced cervical spondylosis by botulinum toxin injection to provide immobilization of neck. In this retrospective study, 6 patients during the period from 2003 to 2010 who were diagnosed with movement disorder-induced cervical spondylosis by neurologists. Each patient received botulinum toxin injection with a total dosage of 500-600U in the sternocleidomastoid, trapezius, splenius capitis, levator scapulae one week prior to surgery. Patients' demographics, diagnoses, injected dosage of botulinum toxin, and operative methods are retrospectively collected. All patients had a repeat cervical spine X-ray to assess the fusion and integrity of the construct. The clinical outcomes were assessed by using modified Rankin scale (mRS). The duration of follow-up was measured from the date of operation to the date of the last clinic visit. The mean age of our patients was 47.2 years ranging from 31 to 64 years. There was a male gender predilection with a male/female ratio of 4:2. The causing diseases prior to cervical spondylosis in our six patients were as follows: cerebral palsy in 3 patients, spasmodic torticollis in 2, and tardive dyskinesia in 1. At the mean follow-up of 56.5 months, all patients had improvement in their daily activities, and the average ratio of improvement in mRS was 41%. Cervical spine X-ray series showed no evidence of implant failure in any of the patients. Intramuscular injection of botulinum toxin provided post-operative immobilization of the neck for treatment of movement disorder-induced cervical spondylosis. These patients need long-term follow up for monitoring of adjacent segmental degeneration. © 2011 JMS.",Excluded
464,"Radionuclide monitoring in Northern Ireland of the Chernobyl nuclear reactor accident. Northern Ireland received higher radiation doses due to the radionuclide contamination from the Chernobyl nuclear reactor accident than did the south of England. Levels of radioactive iodine ((131)I) and caesium ((137)Cs) in cows' milk in Northern Ireland increased to 166 and 120 Bq/l respectively in May 1986, but had decreased by factors of one million, and of twenty-five, respectively, by 1 September 1986. The resultant radiation doses represent less than one per cent of those received by a Northern Ireland individual over a period of 40 years from natural background radiation sources. The added risk to any individual from the Chernobyl accident will therefore be very small and may best be judged in the context of the enormously greater risk of death due to potentially preventable diseases, such as smoking-related lung cancer, and coronary heart disease.",Excluded
1156,"Solar radiation, lip protection, and lip cancer risk in Los Angeles County women (California, United States). A population-based case-control study of 74 women with lip cancer diagnosed from 1978 to 1985 in Los Angeles County (California, United States) and frequency matched to 105 controls investigated the risk of solar radiation and protection from lip sunscreening agents to explore the hypothesis that excess incidence of lip cancer seen in men is due partly to lower rates in women, conferred by frequent use of lip protection. We confirm the importance in women of risk factors similar to those found in men, i.e., fair complexion, sun exposure, and smoking. Risk was related strongly to lifetime solar radiation (odds ratio [OR] = 13.5 for highest quartile of exposure, 95 percent confidence interval [CI] = 4.5-40.6, P trend < 0.0001) and time spent outdoors (OR = 4.7 for highest quartile of average yearly hours, CI = 1.9-12.1, P trend = 0.01). Further, among women with high lifetime solar-radiation exposure, those who used lip protection once a day or less had twice the risk of lip cancer than women who used lip protection more than once a day (OR = 7.3, CI = 1.9-27.2 cf OR = 3.2, CI = 1.1-9.2). These findings show that solar radiation is a major risk factor for lip cancer and suggest that lip sunscreening is protective, thereby supporting the hypothesis that use of lipstick and other sunscreening agents by women has contributed to their lower incidence of this disease.",Excluded
2429,"Phase I drug and light dose-escalation trial of motexafin lutetium and far red light activation (phototherapy) in subjects with coronary artery disease undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention and stent deployment: procedural and long-term results. BACKGROUND: Motexafin lutetium (MLu; Antrin) is a photosensitizer that is taken up by atherosclerotic plaque and concentrated within macrophages and vascular smooth muscle cells. After photoactivation with far red light, MLu facilitates production of cytotoxic oxygen radicals that mediate apoptosis. We assessed the safety and tolerability of phototherapy (PT) with MLu in patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention with stent deployment., METHODS AND RESULTS: An open-label, phase I, drug and light dose-escalation clinical trial of MLu PT enrolled 80 patients undergoing de novo coronary stent deployment. MLu was administered to 79 patients by intravenous infusion 18 to 24 hours before procedure, and photoactivation was performed after balloon predilatation and before stent deployment. Clinical evaluation, serial quantitative angiography, and intravascular ultrasound were performed periprocedurally and at 6 months follow-up. MLu PT was well tolerated without serious dose-limiting toxicities, and side effects (paresthesia and rash) were minor. No adverse angiographic outcomes were attributed to phototherapy., CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates that coronary MLu PT seems safe, and the maximum well-tolerated MLu dose and range of tolerated light doses were identified. These data can be used in phase II efficacy trials of MLu PT for the treatment of coronary atherosclerosis or vulnerable plaque.",Excluded
883,"Biodistribution and Radiation Dosimetry of 124I-DPA-713, a PET Radiotracer for Macrophage-Associated Inflammation. Whole-body PET/CT was performed using 124I-DPA-713, a radioligand for the 18-kDa translocator protein (TSPO), to determine biodistribution and radiation dosimetry. Methods: Healthy subjects aged 18-65 y underwent whole-body PET/CT either at 4, 24, and 48 h or at 24, 48, and 72 h after intravenous injection of 124I-DPA-713. Time-activity curves were generated and used to calculate organ time-integrated activity coefficients for each subject. The resulting time-integrated activity coefficients provided input data for calculation of organ absorbed doses and effective dose for each subject using OLINDA. Subjects were genotyped for the TSPO polymorphism rs6971, and plasma protein binding of 124I-DPA-713 was measured. Results: Three male and 3 female adults with a mean age of 40 +/- 19 y were imaged. The mean administered activity and mass were 70.5 +/- 5.1 MBq (range, 62.4-78.1 MBq) and 469 +/- 34 ng (range, 416-520 ng), respectively. There were no adverse or clinically detectable pharmacologic effects in any of the 6 subjects. No changes in vital signs, laboratory values, or electrocardiograms were observed. 124I-DPA-713 cleared rapidly (4 h after injection) from the lungs, with hepatic elimination and localization to the gastrointestinal tract. The mean effective dose over the 6 subjects was 0.459 +/- 0.127 mSv/MBq, with the liver being the dose-limiting organ (0.924 +/- 0.501 mGy/MBq). The percentage of free radiotracer in blood was approximately 30% at 30 and 60 min after injection. Conclusion: 124I-DPA-713 clears rapidly from the lungs, with predominantly hepatic elimination, and is safe and well tolerated in healthy adults.

2890,"Alternating radiotherapy and chemotherapy for inoperable stage III non- small-cell lung cancer: Long-term results of two phase II GOTHA trials. Purpose/Objective: To report on two consecutive Phase II cooperative trials in which we evaluated the combination of alternating hyperfractionated accelerated radiotherapy and cisplatin-based chemotherapy in inoperable Stage III non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Patients and Methods: Between February 1986 and September 1989, 65 patients were entered in the first trial (GOTHA I), and between December 1989 and October 1992 67 were enrolled in the second trial (GOTHA II). In both protocols, radiotherapy (RT) was administered twice daily, at 6 h intervals, 5 days a week, to a total dose of 63 Gy in 42 fractions of 1.5 Gy. RT was given during weeks 2, 3, 6, and 7, over an elapsed time of 6 weeks. In GOTHA I, three cycles of cisplatin, 60 mg/m2 day 1, mitomycin, 8 mg/m2 day 1, and vindesin 3 mg/m2 day 1 and the first day of the following week, were given during weeks 1, 5, and 9; in GOTHA II, cisplatin 70 mg/m2 day 1 and vinblastin 5 mg/m2 day 1 and the first day of the following week were given during weeks 1, 5, 9, 13, 17, and 21. Result(s): With a minimum follow-up of 3 years, the 1-, 2-, 5-, and 8-year overall survival probability was 56% (95% CI 47-64%), 27% (20-35%), 12% (7- 18%) and 9% (3-16%), respectively, with a median survival of 13.6 months (11.4-16.8). Median follow-up for survivors was 6 years (3.3-9.9). There were no survival differences between Stages IIIA and IIIB (p = 0.84), performance status 0, 1, 2 (p = 0.87), sex (p = 0.45) or between the two treatment protocols. At this time, 14 patients are alive, and 118 have died: 102 from NSCLC, 4 from acute toxicity, 2 from secondary surgery, 4 from other medical causes, and 6 from unknown causes. Correlation between response and long- term survival was poor, since of the 24 patients who survived 3 years or more, only 6 (25%) were classified as having a complete response; the remainder having either a partial response (11, 46%), no change (6, 25%), or 'progressive disease' (1,4%). First site of relapse was local in 31% of these cases, distant in 43%, local and distant in 15%, and unknown in 11%. Main grade 3-4 acute toxicities were nausea-vomiting (17%), mucositis (15%), leukopenia (41%), and thrombocytopenia (11%). Eight patients presented with grade 3-4 symptomatic lung radiation pneumopathy. Conclusion(s): Based on this experience with 132 patients, this combination of alternated RT and chemotherapy (CT) for inoperable Stage III NSCLC is feasible with acceptable toxicity, and long-term results suggest a gain in survival when compared to those obtained with conventional RT alone. However, the still high local and distant failure rates indicate that both local and systemic therapies need to be improved.",Excluded
2169,"National prevalence, trends and outcomes of takotsubo syndrome in hospitalizations with prior history of mediastinal/intrathoracic cancer and radiation therapy. Background: Radiation therapy (RT) for cancers in thoracic/mediastinal region has been linked with heart damage following years of radiation exposure. However, prevalence of takotsubo syndrome (TTS) in patients with prior intrathoracic/mediastinal malignancies treated with RT has never been analyzed on a large scale. Method(s): We identified adult hospitalizations with prior mediastinal/intrathoracic cancer and RT and TTS using ICD-9 CM codes and the National Inpatient Sample (2007-2014) after excluding current admissions for chemotherapy. We then assessed the prevalence, odds, trends and in-hospital outcomes of TTS-related admissions in patients with vs. without prior intrathoracic cancer and RT. Result(s): We identified a total of 5,991,314 hospitalizations with prior intrathoracic/mediastinal malignancies and RT (~73 yrs., 85.2% female), of which 7663 (0.13%, 128 per 100,000) were diagnosed with TTS (~74 yrs., 95.8% females, 88.1% white). Higher odds and rising trends in TTS per 100,000 hospitalizations (from 31 to 241) were seen among patients with prior intrathoracic malignancies and RT as compared to those without (from 19 to 104) (ptrend < 0.001). All-cause in-hospital mortality (4.6% vs 2.8%; OR 1.45; 95%CI 1.29-1.63, p < 0.001), cardiogenic shock (4.3% vs 0.2%), cardiac arrest (3.1% vs 0.9%), arrhythmia (34.3% vs 24.6%), stroke (3.6% vs 2.8%), respiratory failure (14.5% vs 4.6%), and median length of stay and hospital charges were significantly higher in the TTS cohort. Conclusion(s): This study showed higher odds and increasing trends in TTS-related admissions with worse in-hospital outcomes among patients with prior intrathoracic/mediastinal cancer and RT, irrespective of the time interval from cancer diagnosis or RT to TTS occurrence.Copyright © 2020 Elsevier B.V.",Excluded

2362,"Antegrade wire escalation for chronic total occlusions in coronary arteries: Simple algorithms as a key to success. Aims: Antegrade wire escalation (AWE) remains the method of choice for tackling chronic total occlusions (CTOs), especially for lesions with low J-CTO score. To increase the number of operators which treat CTOs and increase AWE success rates, there is a need for a clear, algorithmic approach. We report the results of a simple AWE algorithm with new guidewire technology in coronary CTOs. Method(s): Hundred consecutive CTO lesions selected for AWE as the primary strategy were included in five Benelux centers. The algorithm follows a step-wise increase in guidewire tip load. Lesions were categorized according to the J-CTO score. Primary endpoint was successful guidewire crossing. Result(s): No differences in baseline demographics were present between successful and unsuccessful procedures. Overall, in 75% of the lesions AWE resulted in successful crossing. AWE success rates in easy, intermediate, difficult and very difficult CTOs were 83, 86, 71 and 43%, respectively. 46% could be crossed using a soft guidewire only. An additional success of 34 and 60% could be reached with an intermediate and stiff guidewire, respectively. Adding additional techniques resulted in 88% overall success. Procedure and fluoroscopy times, radiation doses and use of contrast were within highly acceptable ranges (67+/-39min, 27+/-19min, 1.7+/-1.3 Gy, 264+/-123ml). Conclusion(s): The algorithm and new wire technologies led to high success rates. AWE as a standalone procedure is highly successful in J-CTO 0-1. Low- and intermediatevolume CTO operators should try to implement a systematic approach in their CTO procedures, especially for lesions with low J-CTO scores. Adding additional techniques further increases these success rates.© Copyright 2016 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc. All rights reserved.",Excluded
3538,"Comparison of the micronucleus and chromosome aberration techniques for the documentation of cytogenetic damage in radiochemotherapy-treated patients with rectal cancer. PURPOSE: The goal of the interdisciplinary Clinical Research Unit KFO179 (Biological Basis of Individual Tumor Response in Patients with Rectal Cancer) is to develop an individual Response and Toxicity Score for patients with locally advanced rectal cancer treated with neoadjuvant radiochemotherapy. The aim of the present study was to find a reliable and sensitive method with easy scoring criteria and high numbers of cell counts in a short period of time in order to analyze DNA damage in peripheral blood lymphocytes. Thus, the cytokinesis-block micronucleus (CBMN) assay and the chromosome aberration technique (CAT) were tested., MATERIALS AND METHODS: Peripheral blood lymphocytes obtained from 22 patients with rectal cancer before (0 Gy), during (21.6 Gy), and after (50.4 Gy) radiochemotherapy were stimulated in vitro by phytohemagglutinin (PHA); the cultures were then processed for the CBMN assay and the CAT to compare the two methods., RESULTS: A significant increase of chromosomal damage was observed in the course of radiochemotherapy parallel to increasing radiation doses, but independent of the chemotherapy applied. The equivalence of both methods was shown by Westlake's equivalence test., CONCLUSION: The results show that the CBMN assay and the CAT are equivalent. For further investigations, we prefer the CBMN assay, because it is simpler through easy scoring criteria, allows high numbers of cell counts in less time, is reliable, sensitive, and has higher statistical power.

2519,"Triiodothyronine increases calcium loss in a bed rest antigravity model for space flight. Bed rest has been used as a model to simulate the effects of space flight on bone metabolism. Thyroid hormones accelerate bone metabolism. Thus, supraphysiologic doses of this hormone might be used as a model to accelerate bone metabolism during bed rest and potentially simulate space flight. The objective of the study was to quantitate the changes in bone turnover after low doses of triiodothyronine (T(3)) added to short-term bed rest. Nine men and 5 women were restricted to bed rest for 28 days with their heads positioned 6 degrees below their feet. Subjects were randomly assigned to receive either placebo or oral T(3) at doses of 50 to 75 microg/d in a single-blind fashion. Calcium balance was measured over 5-day periods; and T(3), thyroxine, thyroid-stimulating hormone, immunoreactive parathyroid hormone, osteocalcin, bone alkaline phosphatase, and urinary deoxypyridinoline were measured weekly. Triiodothyronine increased 2-fold in the men and 5-fold in the women during treatment, suppressing both thyroxine and thyroid-stimulating hormone. Calcium balance was negative by 300 to 400 mg/d in the T(3)-treated volunteers, primarily because of the increased fecal loss that was not present in the placebo group. Urinary deoxypyridinoline to creatinine ratio, a marker of bone resorption, increased 60% in the placebo group during bed rest, but more than doubled in the T(3)-treated subjects (P < .01), suggesting that bone resorption was enhanced by treatment with T(3).

AIMS AND BACKGROUND: Radiation therapy holds a fundamental role in oncological emergencies such as superior vena cava syndrome, spinal cord compression and endocranial hypertension. The purpose of our study was, by comparing schedules of treatment, to confirm the efficacy of hypofractionated radiation therapy., METHODS: From January 1994 to December 1998, 43 patients with superior vena cava syndrome, 37 patients with metastatic spinal cord compression and 108 patients with endocranial hypertension secondary to metastasis were treated at our institution. In the group of patients with superior vena cava syndrome, radiotherapy schedules were: 4 Gy x 5 to a total dose of 20 Gy (23 patients) and 3 Gy x 10 to a total dose of 30 Gy (20 patients). In the group of patients with spinal cord compression, radiation schedules were: 3 Gy x 10 to a total dose of 30 Gy (15 patients); 4 Gy x 5 to a total dose of 20 Gy (12 patients); a single fraction of 8 Gy in 10 cases, repeated after 1 week in 7 responder cases to a total dose of 16 Gy. 5 out of 37 patients were underwent to laminectomy plus stabilization of the spine and post-operative radiotherapy. In the group of patients with endocranial hypertension, radiotherapy schedules were: 6 Gy x 2 to a total dose of 12 Gy (53 patients), repeated after 4 weeks in 34 responder patients and 3 Gy x 10 to a total dose of 30 Gy (55 patients)., RESULTS: The patients with superior vena cava syndrome, revaluated after 4 weeks at the end of treatment, obtained a partial remission of symptomatology in 73.9% with 20 Gy and in 75% with 30 Gy. The patients with spinal cord compression obtained symptomatic relief in 73.3% with 30 Gy, in 66.6% with 20 Gy and in 70% of cases treated with 8 Gy. The patients with endocranial hypertension obtained symptomatic relief in 64.1% with 12 Gy and in 63.3% with 30 Gy., CONCLUSION: Histology, pretreatment and performance status were important prognostic factors for the response to therapy. Our results demonstrated no significant difference among different schedules of radiotherapy and confirmed the importance of radiotherapy for oncological emergencies: it improves the quality of life and, in responding patients, is associated with a longer survival time.",Excluded
1137,"Cytoplasmic chromatin triggers inflammation in senescence and cancer. Chromatin is traditionally viewed as a nuclear entity that regulates gene expression and silencing. However, we recently discovered the presence of cytoplasmic chromatin fragments that pinch off from intact nuclei of primary cells during senescence, a form of terminal cell-cycle arrest associated with pro-inflammatory responses. The functional significance of chromatin in the cytoplasm is unclear. Here we show that cytoplasmic chromatin activates the innate immunity cytosolic DNA-sensing cGAS-STING (cyclic GMP-AMP synthase linked to stimulator of interferon genes) pathway, leading both to short-term inflammation to restrain activated oncogenes and to chronic inflammation that associates with tissue destruction and cancer. The cytoplasmic chromatin-cGAS-STING pathway promotes the senescence-associated secretory phenotype in primary human cells and in mice. Mice deficient in STING show impaired immuno-surveillance of oncogenic RAS and reduced tissue inflammation upon ionizing radiation. Furthermore, this pathway is activated in cancer cells, and correlates with pro-inflammatory gene expression in human cancers. Overall, our findings indicate that genomic DNA serves as a reservoir to initiate a pro-inflammatory pathway in the cytoplasm in senescence and cancer. Targeting the cytoplasmic chromatin-mediated pathway may hold promise in treating inflammation-related disorders.Copyright © 2017 Macmillan Publishers Limited, part of Springer Nature.

618,"Fluselenamyl: Evaluation of radiation dosimetry in mice and pharmacokinetics in brains of non-human primate. Introduction: To allow quantitative assessment of therapeutic efficacy for therapeutic interventions (either approved or undergoing FDA approvals) for either inhibiting or reducing development of Abeta pathophysiology in vivo, 18F-labelled tracers, such as Florbetapir, Florbetaben, and Flutemetamol have been approved. Previously, we have reported on development and preclinical validation of 18F-Fluselenamyl, comprising traits of translatable Abeta imaging agents. Herein, we report the dosimetry data for 18F-Fluselenamyl to provide radiation dose deposited within organs and determine effective dose (ED) for human studies, while also evaluating its pharmacokinetics in the nonhuman primate brains. Method(s): To evaluate safety profiles of 18F-Fluselenamyl for enabling its deployment as a PET imaging agent for monitoring Abeta pathophysiology in vivo, we estimated the human radiation dosimetry extrapolated from rodent biodistribution data obtained by standard method of organ dissection. Animal biodistribution studies were performed in FVB/NCR mice (20 males, 20 females), following tail-vein injection of the tracer. Following euthanasia of mice, organs were harvested, counted, radiation dose to each organ and whole body was determined using the standard MIRD methodology. For evaluation of pharmacokinetics in non-human primates, following intravenous injection of the tracer, dynamic PET scan of rhesus monkey brains were performed, and co-registered with MR for anatomical reference. Parametric images of tracer transport rate constant and distribution volume relative to cerebellum were generated using a simplified reference tissue model and a spatially-constraint linear regression algorithm. Result(s): The critical organ in humans has been determined to be the gall bladder with a gender average radiation absorbed dose of 0.079 mGy/MBq with an effective dose of 0.017 mSv/MBq and 0.020 mSv/MBq, in males and females, respectively. Therefore, these data provide preliminary projections on human dosimetry derived from rodent estimates, thereby defining safe imaging conditions for further validations in human subjects. Additionally, the tracer penetrated the non-human primate brain and excreted to background levels at later-time points thus pointing to the potential for high signal/noise ratios during noninvasive imaging. Tissue time activity curves (TACs) also show fast initial uptake with maximum projection of activity at 2-6 min post administration followed by clearance of activity at later time-points from cortex, cerebellum, and white matter of nonhuman primate brain. Parametric images confirmed that the 18F-Fluselenamyl has relative high transport rate constant at striatum, thalamus, and cortex. Conclusion(s): The data obtained from radiation dosimetry studies in mice indicate that 18F-Fluselenamyl can be safely used for further evaluation in humans. Additionally, 18F-Fluselenamyl demonstrated ability to traverse the blood brain barrier (BBB) and indicated high initial influx, followed by clearance to background levels in non-human primate brains. Combined information indicates that 18F-Fluselenamyl would be a potential candidate for detecting amyloid plaques in the living human brain.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.",Excluded

2004,"Timing of Adjuvant Fractionated Stereotactic Radiosurgery Affects Local Control of Resected Brain Metastases. Purpose: For resected brain metastases (BMs), stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) is often offered to minimize local recurrence (LR). Although the aim is to deliver SRS within a few weeks of surgery, a variety of socioeconomic, medical, and procedural issues can cause delays. We evaluated the relationship between timing of postoperative SRS and LR. Methods and Materials: We retrospectively identified a consecutive series of patients with BM managed with resection and SRS or fractionated SRS at our institution from 2012 to 2018. We assessed the correlation of time to SRS and other demographic, disease, and treatment variables with LR, local recurrence-free survival, distant recurrence, distant recurrence-free survival, and overall survival. Result(s): A total of 133 patients met inclusion criteria. The median age was 64.5 years. Approximately half of patients had a single BM, and median BM size was 2.9 cm. Gross total resection was achieved in 111 patients (83.5%), and more than 90% of patients received fractionated SRS. The median time to SRS was 37.0 days, and the LR rate was 16.4%. Time to SRS was predictive of LR. The median time from surgery to SRS was 34.0 days for patients without LR versus 61.0 days for those with LR (P < .01). The LR rate was 2.3% with SRS administered <=4 weeks postoperatively, compared with 23.6% if SRS was administered >4 weeks postoperatively (P < .01). Local recurrence-free survival was also improved for patients who underwent SRS at <=4 weeks (P = .02). Delayed SRS was also predictive of distant recurrence (P = .02) but not overall survival. Conclusion(s): In this retrospective study, the strongest predictor of LR after postoperative SRS for BM was time to SRS, and a cutoff of 4 weeks was a reliable predictor of recurrence. These findings merit investigation in a prospective, randomized trial.Copyright © 2021",Excluded
2276,"Parotid dysfunction after various methods of radiotherapy for nasopharyngeal carcinoma. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the radiation induced parotid dysfunction in nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) patients who had received different methods of radiotherapy. METHOD(S): From January 1996 to January 2000, 380 NPC patients were divided into conventional fraction (CF-175 patients), late-course accelerated hyperfractionation (LCAF-63 patients) and intensity modulated radiation therapy (IMRT-142 patients) groups. Conventional radiotherapy was given with a total dose of 70 Gy. Patients in the LCAF group were treated with the same fractionation as CF group until the dose of 36 - 40 Gy, then followed by LCAF radiotherapy to a total dose of 75 Gy. IMRT in the form of full-course was given to a total dose of 72 Gy. Acute parotiditis was observed during the treatment. The parotid secretory function was examined 2 years after radiotherapy. RESULT(S): The dose of parotid in IMRT was much lower than those in the other 2 groups. Extreme damage rates of parotid secretory function in CF, LCAF and IMRT groups were 81.7%, 81.0% and 69.7% (P < 0.05); acute parotiditis rates were 23.4%, 20.4% and 41.3% respectively, with the differences among the 3 groups significant (P < 0.05). CONCLUSION(S): The radiation parotid functional damage differs in the various methods of radiotherapy. IMRT, being able to improve the tumor target coverage and spare the adjacent critical structures, is indicated for NPC.",Excluded

Contrast investigations of hysterosalpingography (HSG) and retrograde urethrography (RUG) fluoroscopy procedures remain the dominant diagnostic tools for the investigation of infertility in females and urethral strictures in males, respectively, owing to the scarcity and high cost of services of alternative diagnostic technologies. In light of the radiological risks associated with contrast based investigations of the genitourinary tract systems, there is a need to assess the magnitude of radiation burden imparted to patients undergoing HSG and RUG fluoroscopy procedures in Tanzania. The air kerma area product (KAP), fluoroscopy time, number of images, organ dose and effective dose to patients undergoing HSG and RUG procedures were obtained from four hospitals. The KAP was measured using a flat transmission ionization chamber, while the organ and effective doses were estimated using the knowledge of the patient characteristics, patient related exposure parameters, geometry of examination, KAP and Monte Carlo calculations (PCXMC). The median values of KAP for the HSG and RUG were 2.2 Gy cm2 and 3.3 Gy cm2, respectively. The median organ doses in the present study for the ovaries, urinary bladder and uterus for the HSG procedures, were 1.0 mGy, 4.0 mGy and 1.6 mGy, respectively, while for urinary bladder and testes of the RUG were 3.4 mGy and 5.9 mGy, respectively.

The median values of effective dose per hospital for the HSG and RUG procedures had a range of 1.6-2.8 mSv and 1.9-5.6 mSv, respectively, while the overall differences between individual effective doses across the four hospitals varied by factors of up to 22.0 and 46.7, respectively for the HSG and RUG procedures. The proposed diagnostic reference levels (DRLs) for the HSG and RUG were for KAP 2.8 Gy cm2 and 3.9 Gy cm2, for fluoroscopy time 0.8 min and 0.9 min, and for number of images 5 and 4, respectively. The suggested DRLs for the HSG and RUG procedures may be used by the radiology departments in Tanzania for management of attained dose levels until the national DRLs are established.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Ltd",Excluded
3368,"An exploratory study of the relation of population density and agricultural activity to hematologic malignancies in North Dakota. Introduction: Established risk factors for hematologic cancers include exposure to ionizing radiation, organic solvents, and genetic mutation; however, the potential roles of environmental and sociological factors are not well explored. As North Dakota engages in significant agricultural activity, the present investigation seeks to determine whether an association exists between the incidence of hematologic cancers and either population density or agricultural occupation for residents of south central North Dakota. Method(s): The present study is a retrospective analysis. Cases of hematologic malignancies and associated pre-malignant conditions were collected from the regional Central North Dakota Cancer Registry, and analysis of study-specific demographic factors was performed. Result(s): Significantly higher incidence of hematologic cancers and pre-malignant disorders was associated with residence in an ""urban"" county and rural city/town. Within the latter designation, there was a higher rate of self-reported agricultural occupation (40% vs 10%, P < 0.0001). Conclusion(s): The increased incidence of hematologic cancer in low population density areas of south central North Dakota supports the need for more detailed prospective research centered on agricultural exposures.",Excluded
1919,"Coronary artery calcium: 0.5 mm slice-thickness reconstruction with adjusted attenuation threshold outperforms 3.0 mm by validating against spatially registered intravascular ultrasound with radiofrequency backscatter. RATIONALE AND OBJECTIVES: Coronary artery calcium (CAC) images can be reconstructed with thinner slice thickness on some modern multidetector-row computed tomography scanners without additional radiation. We hypothesized that the isotropic 0.5-mm CAC reconstruction outperforms the conventional 3.0-mm reconstruction in detecting and quantifying coronary calcium, and we proposed to compare them by validating against spatially registered intravascular ultrasound with radiofrequency backscatter-virtual histology (IVUS-VH)., MATERIALS AND METHODS: Twenty-seven patients were enrolled, and 5976 mm of coronary arteries were analyzed. A semiautomatic software was developed to coregister CAC and IVUS-VH on a detailed slice-by-slice basis. Calcium detection and calcium volume quantification were evaluated and compared using varying calcium attenuation thresholds. Algorithms for deriving individualized optimal threshold and comparable Agatston score on the 0.5-mm reconstruction were developed., RESULTS: The isotropic 0.5-mm reconstruction achieved significantly higher area under receiver-operating curve than the conventional 3.0-mm reconstruction (0.9 vs. 0.74, P < .001). Using the optimal threshold, the 0.5-mm reconstruction had higher sensitivity (0.79 vs. 0.65), specificity (0.85 vs. 0.77), positive predictive value (0.42 vs. 0.29), and negative predictive value (0.97 vs. 0.94) than the 3.0 mm. Individualized optimal threshold was significantly correlated with the image noise (r = 0.66, P < .001) in the 0.5-mm reconstruction., CONCLUSIONS: By optimizing the calcium threshold, the 0.5-mm reconstruction is superior to the conventional 3.0-mm in detecting and quantifying calcium, which may improve the clinical value of CAC without additional radiation.

3065,"Straylight measurements as an indication for cataract surgery. PURPOSE: To assess adding straylight measurements to the indication for cataract surgery., SETTING: Onze Lieve Vrouwe Hospital, Amsterdam, and Zonnestraal Eye Clinic, Hilversum, The Netherlands., DESIGN: Prospective interventional cohort study., METHODS: Before and after cataract extraction, corrected distance visual acuity (CDVA) and straylight were recorded in all patients. Subjective complaints were documented by the 39-item National Eye Institute Visual Function Questionnaire (NEI VFQ-39) and a straylight questionnaire., RESULTS: The population comprised 217 patients with a mean age of 72 years +/- 9.12 (SD) (range 29 to 90 years). Preoperatively, the mean straylight was 1.55 +/- 0.29 log(s) and the mean CDVA, 0.28 +/- 0.21 logMAR. Visual acuity and straylight showed little correlation (R(2) = 0.08). The mean postoperative improvement in CDVA was 0.26 +/- 0.20 logMAR (range -0.12 to 1.12 logMAR) and in straylight, 0.31 +/- 0.32 log(s) (range -0.50 to 1.27 log[s]). The preoperative breakeven point (50% chance of postoperative improvement) was 0.06 logMAR for CDVA and 1.29 log(s) for straylight. Preoperative and postoperative questionnaires showed straylight had almost the same influence as visual acuity on quality of vision., CONCLUSIONS: Straylight and visual acuity measure different aspects of quality of vision and influenced subjective visual quality almost equally.

2194,"A deep learning tool for fully automated measurements of sagittal spinopelvic balance from X-ray images: performance evaluation. Purpose: The purpose of this study is to evaluate the performance of a novel deep learning (DL) tool for fully automated measurements of the sagittal spinopelvic balance from X-ray images of the spine in comparison with manual measurements. Method(s): Ninety-seven conventional upright sagittal X-ray images from 55 subjects were retrospectively included in this study. Measurements of the parameters of the sagittal spinopelvic balance, i.e., the sacral slope (SS), pelvic tilt (PT), spinal tilt (ST), pelvic incidence (PI) and spinosacral angle (SSA), were obtained manually by identifying specific anatomical landmarks using the SurgiMap Spine software and by the fully automated DL tool. Statistical analysis was performed in terms of the mean absolute difference (MAD), standard deviation (SD) and Pearson correlation, while the paired t test was used to search for statistically significant differences between manual and automated measurements. Result(s): The differences between reference manual measurements and those obtained automatically by the DL tool were, respectively, for SS, PT, ST, PI and SSA, equal to 5.0degree (3.4degree), 2.7degree (2.5degree), 1.2degree (1.2degree), 5.5degree (4.2degree) and 5.0degree (3.5degree) in terms of MAD (SD), with a statistically significant corresponding Pearson correlation of 0.73, 0.90, 0.95, 0.81 and 0.71. No statistically significant differences were observed between the two types of measurement (p value always above 0.05). Conclusion(s): The differences between measurements are in the range of the observer variability of manual measurements, indicating that the DL tool can provide clinically equivalent measurements in terms of accuracy but superior measurements in terms of cost-effectiveness, reliability and reproducibility.Copyright © 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.",Excluded

1221,"Prevalence of less severe hypercortisolism in fractured patients admitted in an outpatient clinic for metabolic bone diseases. Purpose: To evaluate the prevalence of less severe hypercortisolism (LSH) in fractured patients, and its association with hypertension, hyperglicemia, dyslipidemia, and obesity. Method(s): From July 2015 to October 2018 we enrolled all fractured patients admitted in our outpatient center for metabolic bone diseases, after exclusion of patients with secondary osteoporosis apart from diabetes and taking drugs known to affect bone metabolism. In all enrolled patients we collected data regarding gonadal status, history of diabetes, high blood pressure, dyslipidemia, and measured blood pressure, lipid profile, fasting glycaemia. Bone mass was measured with DXA at lumbar spine and femoral neck and the presence of fractures was evaluated with X-ray of thoracic and lumbar spine. All patients performed twice, 1 mg overnight dexametasone suppression test (DST) and, as confirmatory, 2day low-dose DST for diagnosing hypercortisolism. Result(s): We enrolled 101 fractured patients (75 females, 26 males), aged 65 +/- 10.3 years. Five out of 101 (5.0%) patients were diagnosed as LSH. Fifty-five (54.5%) out of 101 were hypertensive, 57 (56.4%) dyslipidemic, 17 (16.8%) hyperglicaemic, 28(27.7%) obese patients. LSH tended to be associated to blood hypertension [5/5 vs 50/96 (Fisher exact test, p = 0.06) hypertensive patients]. Four out five LSH patients were hypogonadic. Conclusion(s): Our study confirms that a nonnegligible percentage of fractured subjects actually presents an unrecognized hypercortisolism. Accordingly, regardless of age, we suggest to screen for hypercortisolism all patients with established osteoporosis and in particular hypertensive subjects.Copyright © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC part of Springer Nature.",Excluded
698,"Hybrid resistance to parental bone marrow grafts in nonlethally irradiated mice. Resistance to parental bone marrow (BM) grafts in F1 hybrid recipients is due to natural killer (NK) cell-mediated rejection triggered through ""missing self"" recognition. ""Hybrid resistance"" has usually been investigated in lethally irradiated F1 recipients in conjunction with pharmacological activation of NK cells. Here, we investigated BM-directed NK-cell alloreactivity in settings of reduced conditioning. Nonlethally irradiated (1-3 Gy) or nonirradiated F1 (C57BL6 x BALB/c) recipient mice received titrated doses (5-20 x 106) of unseparated parental BALB/c BM without pharmacological NK cell activation. BM successfully engrafted in all mice and multilineage donor chimerism persisted long-term (24 weeks), even in the absence of irradiation. Chimerism was associated with the rearrangement of the NK-cell receptor repertoire suggestive of reduced reactivity to BALB/c. Chimerism levels were lower after transplantation with parental BALB/c than with syngeneic F1 BM, indicating partial NK-mediated rejection of parental BM. Activation of NK cells with polyinosinic-polycytidylic acid sodium salt poly(I:C), reduced parental chimerism in nonirradiated BM recipients but did not prevent hematopoietic stem cell engraftment. In contrast, equal numbers of parental lymph node cells were completely rejected. Hence, hybrid resistance leads to incomplete rejection of parental BM under reduced conditioning settings.Copyright © 2018 The Authors American Journal of Transplantation published by Wiley Periodicals, Inc. on behalf of The American Society of Transplantation and the American Society of Transplant Surgeons",Excluded

The Cognitive Abilities Screening Instrument (CASI) was developed by Japanese and American researchers, including the authors, to examine cognitive functions, based on previous neuropsychological tests, such as Hasegawa's Dementia Scale and the MMSE. From the Adult Health Study (AHS) population of the Radiation Effects Research Foundation, 2052 men and women aged 60 or over and living in Hiroshima were evaluated for their cognitive functions using the CASI. Dementia was diagnosed in 93 and 1,959 were considered not to suffer from dementia based on the DSM-III-R criteria using neurological examination and the Informant Questionnaire on Cognitive Decline in the Elderly (IQCODE) completed by caregivers. Multivariate regression analysis not only indicated that total score was higher with lower age and higher education but that the slope of its decrease is steeper with higher age and fewer years of education. The slope of score decrease with increase of age was steeper for women than for men. Furthermore, CASI items were categorized by domains of cognitive function. Multivariate regression analysis for each cognitive domain showed clear effects of age and level of education. The effect of age for the nondementia subjects was large in cognitive domains dealing with temporal orientation, short-term memory, and list-generating fluency. The most useful cognitive domains for diagnosing dementia were temporal orientation, short-term memory, and list-generating fluency, as was indicated by high sensitivity and specificity.",Excluded
204,"Curative stereotactic body radiotherapy for liver malignancy. Nine patients with 11 primary or secondary liver non-neuroendocrine malignancies with mean and maximum diameters of 4.0 and 7.7 cm became long-term survivors after precision irradiation in a stereotactic body frame. Doses varied from 20 to 45 Gy split at 2-4 occasions a few days apart, with higher doses in the target centers. Occasional chemotherapy was stopped well before irradiation. No hospitalizations were needed because side effects, regional pain and nausea, were mild. All patients have now survived 5-14 years without recurrences. Two verified and one suspected secondary cancers occurred in organs close to the irradiated targets, and two of them could be resected for cure. Precision irradiation can thus cure selected liver malignancies. It is the first non-invasive method to achieve this, and the present patients are its first long-term survivors. A prolonged follow-up period is, however, necessary, because we have in other patients seen local tumor regrowth as late as four years after irradiation. The approach may cure some tumors, which are technically unsuited for other treatment modalities, and can be used for patients at high surgical risk. The success rate for local control seems good, but has to be defined by formal studies after optimization of radiation doses. © 2008 Humana Press Inc.",Excluded
2032,"Acute Erythemal Ultraviolet Radiation Causes Systemic Immunosuppression in the Absence of Increased 25-Hydroxyvitamin D3 Levels in Male Mice. Vitamin D is synthesised by ultraviolet (UV) irradiation of skin and is hypothesized to be a direct mediator of the immunosuppression that occurs following UV radiation (UVR) exposure. Both UVR and vitamin D drive immune responses towards tolerance by ultimately increasing the suppressive activities of regulatory T cells. To examine a role for UVR-induced vitamin D, vitamin D3-deficient mice were established by dietary vitamin D3 restriction. In comparison to vitamin D3-replete mice, vitamin D3-deficient mice had significantly reduced serum levels of 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 (25(OH)D3, <20 nmol.L-1) and 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (1,25(OH)2D3, <20 pmol.L-1). Following either acute erythemal UVR, or chronic sub-erythemal UVR (8 exposures over 4 weeks) treatment, serum 25(OH)D3 levels significantly increased in vitamin D3-deficient female but not male mice. To determine if UVR-induced vitamin D was a mediator of UVR-induced systemic immunosuppression, responses were measured in mice that were able (female) or unable (male) to increase systemic levels of 25(OH)D3 after UVR. Erythemal UVR (>=4 kJ/m2) suppressed contact hypersensitivity responses (T helper type-1 or -17), aspects of allergic airway disease (T helper type-2) and also the in vivo priming capacity of bone marrow-derived dendritic cells to a similar degree in female and male vitamin D3-deficient mice. Thus, in male mice, UVR-induced 25(OH)D3 is not essential for mediating the immunosuppressive effects of erythemal UVR. © 2012 Gorman et al.",Excluded

BACKGROUND: Vertebroplasty is one of the effective methods for minimally invasive treatment of osteoporotic vertebral compression fractures. Bone cement as the most commonly used filling material is disputed on its clinical effects of different viscosity. OBJECTIVE(S): To compare the efficacy and safety of different viscosity bone cement vertebroplasty in the treatment of osteoporotic vertebral compression fractures. METHOD(S): One hundred and eighty-three patients with osteoporotic vertebral compression fracture were randomly divided into four groups: percutaneous vertebroplasty with high viscosity bone cement group (group A), percutaneous vertebroplasty with low viscosity bone cement group (group B), percutaneous kyphoplasty with high viscosity bone cement group (group C), and percutaneous kyphoplasty with low viscosity bone cement group (group D). RESULTS AND CONCLUSION(S): (1) The operative time and X-ray exposure time were longer in the two low viscosity bone cement groups than the two corresponding high viscosity bone cement groups, respectively. (2) After operation, visual analogue scale scores and disability index scores were gradually decreased in the all the groups. Compared with the group A, the visual analogue scale score and disability index score were lower in the group C; compared with group B, the visual analogue scale score and disability index score were lower in the group D. (3) After operation, the kyphosis Cobb angle was gradually reduced and the sagittal index of injured vertebrae were gradually increased in all the groups. The postoperative Cobb angle value was ranked as follows: group A > group C > group D. (4) Compared with two low viscosity bone cement groups, two high viscosity bone cement group had lower incidence of adverse events. These findings indicate that high viscosity bone cement has better safety and effectiveness in the treatment of osteoporotic vertebral compression fractures. The clinical efficacy of percutaneous kyphoplasty with high viscosity bone cement is the best among the four systems.Copyright © 2018, Journal of Clinical Rehabilitative Tissue Engineering Research.

Purpose: To retrospectively evaluate the diagnostic performance and complications of C-arm cone-beam CT (CBCT)-guided percutaneous transthoracic needle biopsy (PCNB) in 1108 patients. Material(s) and Method(s): This retrospective study was approved by the institutional review board. From January 2009 to December 2011, 1108 patients (633 males and 475 females; mean age, 62.4 years+/-12.3; range 9-89 years) with 1110 pulmonary lesions (mean size, 2.7 cm+/-1.7; range 0.5-13.0 cm) underwent 1153 CBCTguided PCNB with or without virtual navigation guidance. Diagnostic performance, complication rate, and radiation dose of CBCT-guided PCNB were investigated. Variables influencing the diagnostic performance and complication were assessed using univariate and multivariate analysis. Result(s): 1153 PCNBs, histologic specimens were successfully obtained in 1148 PCNBs (99.6%); 767 malignant (66.5%), 314 benign (27.2%), and 67 indeterminate (5.8%). Pulmonary lesions were correctly diagnosed in 1050 PCNBs and were incorrectly diagnosed in 31 PCNBs. The sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of CBCT-guided PCNB was 96.0% (736/767), 100% (314/314), and 97.1% (1050/1081), respectively. Lesions in the lower lobe (odds ratio (OR), 2.956; P=0.013) and lesion <=1 cm (OR, 2.427; P=0.021) were significant risk factors for diagnostic failure (31 PCNBs with false negatives and 5 with inadequate samplings). As for complications, pneumothorax and hemoptysis occurred in 196 (17.0%) and 80 (6.9%) procedures, respectively. However there were no severe complications such as mortality or air embolism. As for influencing factors for complications, pleural passage >=2 (OR, 4.998; P<0.001) and emphysema along the needle pathway (OR, 2.612; P<0.001) were the two most significant risk factors for pneumothorax, and ground-glass nodules (OR, 4.188; P<0.001) were the most significant risk factor for hemoptysis. The mean radiation exposure during the procedures was 7.3 mSv+/-3.8 (range, 0.7-15.3 mSv). Conclusion(s): CBCT-guided PCNB is a safe and highly accurate diagnostic method of pulmonary lesions. Clinical Implication: CBCT-guided PCNB with its real-time capability and CT function has been shown to be highly accurate and safe in a large clinical population and thus can be considered an established method for tissue sampling in clinical practice.",Excluded

2812,"An action spectrum (290-320 nm) for TNFalpha protein in human skin in vivo suggests that basal-layer epidermal DNA is the chromophore. Terrestrial solar UVB radiation (=295-320 nm) readily induces cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers (CPDs) in human skin DNA that result in characteristic mutations associated with nonmelanoma skin cancer. The proinflammatory cytokine TNFalpha is important in mouse skin chemical carcinogenesis and is thought to also play a role in UVR-induced skin cancer by its immunomodulatory properties. There is some in vitro evidence that CPDs initiate the production of TNFalpha, and we tested this hypothesis by comparing the wavelength dependence (action spectrum) for TNFalpha protein induction in human skin in vivo with our earlier in vivo action spectra for CPD induction in four different epidermal layers of human skin. Normal volunteers (n = 35) were irradiated with physiologically relevant doses of monochromatic UVB (290-320 nm), and TNFalpha concentration was assessed, by high-sensitivity ELISA, in exudates from skin suction blisters raised 8 h after irradiation. An action spectrum, constructed from the slopes of the dose-response curves at the different wavelengths, showed maximal efficacy at 300 nm. An excellent match was observed for TNFalpha and the CPD action spectrum for cells in the lower basal epidermis. These data strongly suggest that UVB-induced photodamage to DNA in the epidermal basal layer is a major trigger for TNFalpha production. The TNFalpha may originate directly from the keratinocytes in this layer or inflammatory cells that are rapidly recruited into the upper dermis (e.g., neutrophils) as a consequence of DNA photodamage to basal-layer keratinocytes. © 2007 by The National Academy of Sciences of the USA.",Excluded

In 1G, the apparent time constant (Td) of postrotatory SPV decay with the head tilted face down is 55% of that with head erect (Te). This phenomenon is called ""nystagmus dumping"" and has been attributed to G effects on VOR velocity storage. Similarly, postrotatory sensation duration with head tilted (Dd) is 32% of that when head erect (De). In parabolic flight, Te and De are 70% of 1-G values, but a pitch back dumping movement produces no further change. Te, Td, and Dd have not previously been measured in orbital flight. VOR and sensation duration was tested in 4 crewmembers in 4 preflight, 1 inflight (days 4 or 5) and 4 post flight sessions. Bitemporal EOG was recorded with eyes open in darkness. Instructions were to ""gaze straight ahead,"" and indicate when ""rotation sensation disappears or becomes ambiguous"". Subjects were rotated CW and CCW head erect for 1 min at 120 degrees/s, stopped, and EOG was recorded for another 1 min. This procedure was then used to study dumping, except that immediately after chair stop, subjects pitched their head forward 90 degrees. SPV was calculated using order statistic filtering, and dropouts removed using an iterative model fitting method. Te and Td were determined by logarithmic linear regression of mean SPV for each subject. In orbit, 90 degrees pitch movement produced rapid subjective dumping, but not nystagmus dumping. Dd was noticeably shorter (""almost instantaneous"") compared to preflight Dd. Te and Td in orbit were similar to preflight Te for 3/4 subjects (rather than to preflight Td as expected). No consistent VOR gain changes were seen in orbit. Although Te is known to decrease acutely in parabolic flight, a longer time constant was measured in 3/4 subjects after 4-5 days adaptation to weightlessness, suggesting a return of angular velocity storage.",Excluded

We explored the association between polymorphisms of the DNA repair gene XRCC1 (codons 194, 280, and 399) and lung cancer risk in a case-control study nested within a cohort of tin miners. Cases were those diagnosed with lung cancer over 6 years of follow-up (n = 108). Two controls, matched on age and sex, were selected for each case by incidence density sampling. Of the three polymorphisms, only the XRCC1 Arg280His allele was associated with increased lung cancer risk (odds ratio, 1.8; 95% confidence interval, 1.0-3.4) after adjustment for radon and tobacco exposure. In addition, individuals with the variant Arg280His allele who were alcohol drinkers seemed to be at higher risk for lung cancer compared with those with the homozygous wild-type genotype. Conversely, individuals with the variant Arg194Trp allele who were alcohol drinkers seemed to be at lower risk for lung cancer compared with those with the homozygous wild-type genotype. Polymorphisms of XRCC1 appear to influence risk of lung cancer and may modify risk attributable to environmental exposures.",Excluded

3205,"Assessment of glenoid inclination on routine clinical radiographs and computed tomography examinations of the shoulder. Background: Accurate assessment of glenoid inclination is of interest for a variety of conditions and procedures. The purpose of this study was to develop an accurate and reproducible measurement for glenoid inclination on standardized anterior-posterior (AP) radiographs and on computed tomography (CT) images. Material(s) and Method(s): Three consistently identifiable angles were defined: Angle alpha by line AB connecting the superior and inferior glenoid tubercle (glenoid fossa) and the line identifying the scapular spine; angle beta by line AB and the floor of the supraspinatus fossa; angle gamma by line AB and the lateral margin of the scapula. Experimental study: these 3 angles were measured in function of the scapular position to test their resistance to rotation. Conventional AP radiographs and CT scans were acquired in extension/flexion and internal/external rotation in a range up to +/-40degree. Clinical study: the inter-rater reliability of all angles was assessed on AP radiographs and CT scans of 60 patients (30 with proximal humeral fractures, 30 with osteoarthritis) by 2 independent observers. Result(s): The experimental study showed that angle alpha and beta have a resistance to rotation of up to +/-20degree. The deviation from neutral position was not more than +/-10degree. The results for the inter-rater reliability analyzed by Bland-Altman plots for the angle beta fracture group were (mean +/- standard deviation) -0.1 +/- 4.2 for radiographs and -0.3 +/- 3.3 for CT scans; and for the osteoarthritis group were -1.2 +/- 3.8 for radiographs and -3.0 +/- 3.6 for CT scans. Conclusion(s): Angle beta is the most reproducible measurement for glenoid inclination on conventional AP radiographs, providing a resistance to positional variability of the scapula and a good inter-rater reliability. © 2012 Journal of Shoulder and Elbow Surgery Board of Trustees.",Excluded
2269,"Changes in the Selected Antioxidant Defense Parameters in the Blood of Patients after High Resolution Computed Tomography. Ionizing radiation generated during high resolution computed tomography (HRCT) scanning may have an indirect effect on the mechanisms regulating the oxidative-antioxidant balance in the human body, which is one of the necessary factors ensuring the maintenance of its homeostasis. The aim of the study was to analyze the response of antioxidant systems through the determination of the antioxidant markers in the blood of patients exposed to oxidative stress resulting from the routine HRCT examination of the chest. Blood of 35 people aged 60.77 +/- 10.81 taken before and at four time points after the examination constituted the test material. The determination of the total antioxidant capacity expressed as ferric reducing ability of plasma (FRAP) and ferric reducing antioxidant activity and ascorbic acid concentration (FRASC) were performed together with an examination of catalase activity and the concentration of the reduced glutathione. The organism's response to ionizing radiation was associated with a significant decrease in the antioxidant markers' levels at all time-points and showed a significant negative correlation depending on the radiation dose. Visible down-regulation of these markers is a response to increased oxidative stress. In light of the obtained results, the measurement of the selected markers of antioxidant defense may be a useful parameter of oxidative stress caused by ionizing radiation.",Excluded

526,"Abdominal radiographs understimate the prevalence of paget's disease of bone in a fifht of patients. Background The most frequent skeletal localizations of Paget's disease of bone (PDB) are the pelvis, lumbar spine and proximal femur. Thus, an x-ray including these locations, such as an abdominal radiograph, allows the identification of the disease with a high probability. However, according to previous studies, only 60 to 90% of the global skeletal affection by PDB is included in the area of an abdominal radiograph [1]. In order toknow with certainty the real prevalence of PDB in any population, usually assessed by abdominal radiographs, we need to know the percentage of patients with PDB without pagetic affection of bones included in an abdominal x-ray. Objectives To estimate the percentage of PBD patients without skeletal affection in the pelvis, lumbar spine and/or proximal femur to assess the underestimation of the prevalence of PDB assessed by abdominal radiographs. Methods Transversal descriptive study based on medical records of 602 patients from the Spanish National PBD Register [2]. We included consecutive patients with a skeletal radionuclide scintigraphy and alkaline phosphatase measurement in the year of the diagnosis. We excluded patients treated with bisphosphonates or calcitonin in the previous five years. A central lecture of scintigraphies was made by expert rheumatologists, who identified the pagetic bones included in an abdominal radiograph and in the whole skeleton. Results 214 (36%) bone scans were analyzed. There were not significant differences (p>0.25) between the included patients and patients from the Register in age, gender and time from diagnosis. The percentage of patients with PDB in the lumbar spine, pelvis and/or proximal femur was 80% (IC 95%: [74%>85%]), without differences by gender. This implies that 1/5 of patients are not diagnosed of PDB if only abdominal x-rays are analyzed. New PDB prevalence estimation in Spain is 1.2% (0.9%>1.6%), being 1.5% (1%>2.1%) in men and 1% (0.7%>1.5%) in women. Figure 1 shows the percentage of patients with pagetic involvement in each area. Conclusions Evaluation by abdominal x-rays underestimates 1/5 of patients with Paget's disease of bone. According to these data, the prevalence of this disease in Spain is 1.2%.

541,"Biological dosimetry after yttrium-90 citrate colloid radiosynoviorthesis. UNLABELLED: Radiosynoviorthesis (RSO) with the ss-particle-emitting nuclide yttrium-90 is an established concept for the treatment of persistent synovitis of the knee joint. The AIM of this study was to investigate the biological radiation effect on the basis of a characteristic radiation parameter., PATIENTS, METHODS: After RSO procedures with yttrium-90 citrate colloid and subsequent immobilisation of the knee, blood specimens of 10 patients were collected immediately before RSO and 11 to 13 days after the intervention. The yield of dicentric chromosomes in the lymphocytes was determined exclusively in metaphases of the first cell cycle in vitro. In addition, activity leakage was measured by wholebody bremsstrahlung-scintigraphy., RESULTS: No statistically significant increase in the number of dicentric chromosomes (26 before treatment and 34 after treatment) in 20 192 cells analyzed from the 20 blood samples could be found as a result of RSO. However, the analysis of at least 1000 cells per blood sample demonstrates a tendency for a biological radiation effect in the blood of patients on the basis of this characteristic radiation parameter. Two of the 10 RSO patients had undergone a second RSO using yttrium-90 citrate, whereby one patient displayed activity transport out of the knee joint, amounting to 6 MBq. Only for him a radiation effect (about 130 mGy per single RSO) could be calculated by biological dosimetry., CONCLUSION: Since in general, based on the analysis of dicentric chromosomes in at least 1000 lymphocytes per individual, detection limits for groups of persons after long-term exposures to low-LET radiation of 50-100 mGy are possible, we assume that RSO with yttrium-90 should be associated with a low whole-body radiation exposure.",Excluded

The outcomes of interest were procedural outcomes including procedural time, contrast amount, and radiation dose, technical and procedural success rates, in-hospital major adverse cerebral and cardiac events (MACCEs), and procedure-related complications. Result(s): Procedure time was significantly shorter in the direct RA compared to the indirect RA [60 min (interquartile range (IQR), 42-90 min) indirect RA vs. 68 min (IQR, 50-106 min), p<0.001]. Technical and procedural success rate, in-hospital MACCEs and procedure-related complication were similar between the two groups. There was no event of cardiac tamponade and in-hospital stroke in the direct RA. Also, severe coronary artery dissection and coronary perforation were numerically less frequently observed in the direct RA compared to the indirect RA.

3707,"Analysis of EPR and FISH studies of radiation doses in persons who lived in the upper reaches of the Techa River. Waterborne radioactive releases into the Techa River from the Mayak Production Association in Russia during 1949-1956 resulted in significant doses to about 30,000 persons who lived in downstream settlements. The residents were exposed to internal and external radiation. Two methods for reconstruction of the external dose are considered in this paper, electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) measurements of teeth, and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) measurements of chromosome translocations in circulating lymphocytes. The main issue in the application of the EPR and FISH methods for reconstruction of the external dose for the Techa Riverside residents was strontium radioisotopes incorporated in teeth and bones that act as a source of confounding local exposures. In order to estimate and subtract doses from incorporated (89,90)Sr, the EPR and FISH assays were supported by measurements of (90)Sr-body burdens and estimates of (90)Sr concentrations in dental tissues by the luminescence method. The resulting dose estimates derived from EPR to FISH measurements for residents of the upper Techa River were found to be consistent: The mean values vary from 510 to 550 mGy for the villages located close to the site of radioactive release to 130-160 mGy for the more distant villages. The upper bound of individual estimates for both methods is equal to 2.2-2.3 Gy. The EPR- and FISH-based dose estimates were compared with the doses calculated for the donors using the most recent Techa River Dosimetry System (TRDS). The TRDS external dose assessments are based on the data on contamination of the Techa River floodplain, simulation of air kerma above the contaminated soil, age-dependent lifestyles and individual residence histories. For correct comparison, TRDS-based doses were calculated from two sources: external exposure from the contaminated environment and internal exposure from (137)Cs incorporated in donors' soft tissues. It is shown here that the TRDS-based absorbed doses in tooth enamel and muscle are in agreement with EPR- and FISH-based estimates within uncertainty bounds. Basically, this agreement between the estimates has confirmed the validity of external doses calculated with the TRDS.",Excluded

904,"Advanced multimodal nanoparticles delay tumor progression with clinical radiation therapy. Radiation therapy is a major treatment regimen for more than 50% of cancer patients. The collateral damage induced on healthy tissues during radiation and the minimal therapeutic effect on the organ-of-interest (target) is a major clinical concern. Ultra-small, renal clearable, silica based gadolinium chelated nanoparticles (SiGdNP) provide simultaneous MR contrast and radiation dose enhancement. The high atomic number of gadolinium provides a large photoelectric cross-section for increased photon interaction, even for high-energy clinical radiation beams. Imaging and therapy functionality of SiGdNP were tested in cynomolgus monkeys and pancreatic tumor-bearing mice models, respectively. A significant improvement in tumor cell damage (double strand DNA breaks), growth suppression, and overall survival under clinical radiation therapy conditions were observed in a human pancreatic xenograft model. For the first time, safe systemic administration and systematic renal clearance was demonstrated in both tested species. These findings strongly support the translational potential of SiGdNP for MR-guided radiation therapy in cancer treatment.Copyright © 2016 Elsevier B.V.",Excluded
12,"Analysis of entrance surface dose in general radiographies using body mass index classification.

The primary purpose of our study was to determine the entrance surface dose (ESD) for men and women, from which we established an easy estimation equation for ESD, using the body mass index (BMI) as a variable. From April 2000 to March 2002, 15424 patients (8586 men, 6838 women; mean age, 58 years old; age range, 20 to 90 years old) were recruited in this study. Estimated equation of ESD was obtained from the dispersion data of BMI and ESD. Welch's t-test was used as the test of significance. P values evaluated levels of significance at 5%. Analysis for correlation coefficients was used for Peason's correlation coefficient test. And, we also performed a simple regression analysis. The results of the simple regression equation with BMI as variable (y: ESD [mGy], x: BMI [kg/m(2)), and the median values of ESD were as follows: for chest PA, men, 0.22, y = 0.0145 x - 0.0876, women, 0.20, y = 0.0126 x - 0.0704; for abdomen AP, men, 2.12, y = 0.2707 x - 3.7206, women, 1.65, y = 0.2561 x - 3.7989; for pelvis AP, men, 1.87, y = 0.0517 x + 0.8753, women, 1.77, y = 0.0674 x + 0.4775; for lumbar spine AP, men, 3.08, y = 0.3462 x - 4.1416, women, 2.66, y = 0.2525 x - 2.8131; and for lumbar spine lateral, men, 9.31, y = 0.6012 x - 3.7216, women, 7.42, y = 0.3147 x + 0.3384.

To assess whether nimustine (ACNU), a drug that can cross the blood brain barrier, combined with radiotherapy, improved the survival of patients with primary central nervous system lymphoma (PCNSL). Clinical materials and methods. Between 1995 and 2005, we treated 63 immunocompetent PCNSL patients with combination therapy consisting of intra-arterial ACNU (100mg/m 2) and whole brain radiotherapy (36-50Gy). Their median age was 60 years (range 28-81). The median follow-up was 24 months. Findings. With this regimen we achieved a complete response rate of 75% (43 of 57 patients). Kaplan-Meier estimates for median progression-free survival and median overall survival were 26 and 39 months, respectively. The 3- and 5-year survival rates were 51% (95% confidence interval [CI], 36-65%) and 32% (95% CI, 17-47%), respectively. By multivariate analysis, age (<60 vs. >=60 years) was the only statistically significant prognostic factor; the WBRT dose, sex, and number of tumors were not significant prognostic factors in this study. Myelosuppression was the most frequent side effect, 60% of patients experienced grade 3-4 leukopenia. Late neurotoxicity as a result of treatment was observed in 14 of 43 patients (34%) and higher age (>60) was associated with a high risk of neurotoxicity. Conclusion. The intra-arterial administration of ACNU combined with radiation therapy yielded a high response rate at acceptable toxicity levels in younger patients with PCNSL. However, late neurotoxicity was a serious complication in patients above 60 years of age. © 2007 Springer-Verlag.",Excluded

Importance: Oral mucositis causes substantial morbidity during head and neck radiotherapy. In a randomized study, doxepin mouthwash was shown to reduce oral mucositis-related pain. A common mouthwash comprising diphenhydramine-lidocaine-antacid is also widely used., Objective: To evaluate the effect of doxepin mouthwash or diphenhydramine-lidocaine-antacid mouthwash for the treatment of oral mucositis-related pain., Design, Setting, and Participants: A phase 3 randomized trial was conducted from November 1, 2014, to May 16, 2016, at 30 US institutions and included 275 patients who underwent definitive head and neck radiotherapy, had an oral mucositis pain score of 4 points or greater (scale, 0-10), and were followed up for a maximum of 28 days., Interventions: Ninety-two patients were randomized to doxepin mouthwash (25 mg/5 mL water); 91 patients to diphenhydramine-lidocaine-antacid; and 92 patients to placebo., Main Outcome and Measures: The primary end point was total oral mucositis pain reduction (defined by the area under the curve and adjusted for baseline pain score) during the 4 hours after a single dose of doxepin mouthwash or diphenhydramine-lidocaine-antacid mouthwash compared with a single dose of placebo. The minimal clinically important difference was a 3.5-point change. The secondary end points included drowsiness, unpleasant taste, and stinging or burning. All scales ranged from 0 (best) to 10 (worst)., Results: Among the 275 patients randomized (median age, 61 years; 58 [21%] women), 227 (83%) completed treatment per protocol. Mucositis pain during the first 4 hours decreased by 11.6 points in the doxepin mouthwash group, by 11.7 points in the diphenhydramine-lidocaine-antacid mouthwash group, and by 8.7 points in the placebo group. The between-group difference was 2.9 points (95% CI, 0.2-6.0; P = .02) for doxepin mouthwash vs placebo and 3.0 points (95% CI, 0.1-5.9; P = .004) for diphenhydramine-lidocaine-antacid mouthwash vs placebo. More drowsiness was reported with doxepin mouthwash vs placebo (by 1.5 points [95% CI, 0-4.0]; P = .03), unpleasant taste (by 1.5 points [95% CI, 0-3.0]; P = .002), and stinging or burning (by 4.0 points [95% CI, 2.5-5.0]; P < .001). Maximum grade 3 adverse events for the doxepin mouthwash occurred in 3 patients (4%); diphenhydramine-lidocaine-antacid mouthwash, 3 (4%); and placebo, 2 (2%).

896,"Axon initial segment Kv1 channels control axonal action potential waveform and synaptic efficacy. Action potentials are binary signals that transmit information via their rate and temporal pattern. In this context, the axon is thought of as a transmission line, devoid of a role in neuronal computation. Here, we show a highly localized role of axonal Kv1 potassium channels in shaping the action potential waveform in the axon initial segment (AIS) of layer 5 pyramidal neurons independent of the soma. Cell-attached recordings revealed a 10-fold increase in Kv1 channel density over the first 50 microm of the AIS. Inactivation of AIS and proximal axonal Kv1 channels, as occurs during slow subthreshold somatodendritic depolarizations, led to a distance-dependent broadening of axonal action potentials, as well as an increase in synaptic strength at proximal axonal terminals. Thus, Kv1 channels are strategically positioned to integrate slow subthreshold signals, providing control of the presynaptic action potential waveform and synaptic coupling in local cortical circuits.",Excluded
3046,"[Assessment of the genetic risk of radiation by irradiation data from laboratory mammals]. An attempt has been made to assess quantitatively genetic risk of radiation for man based on mammalian (mostly mouse) data and using the direct method proposed by UNSCEAR. The parameter employed was induction of reciprocal translocations. Two assumptions were made: human radiosensitivity equals that of the mouse; and dose-response is linear. From observations with acute gamma irradiation the estimate of risk per 10(-2) Gy was as follows: 39 translocation heterozygotes are expected among one million F1 conceptions, 5 cases of multiple congenital anomalies, 25 abortions recorded and 49 unrecorded. Chronic gamma irradiation at dose rates of 1.3 X 10(-5), 1.7 X 10(-4) and 1.0 X 10(-4) Gy/min was 3 to 10 times less effective. Exposure to 4.2 GeV deuterons proved inferior in effectiveness to gamma irradiation. Chronic exposure to 4.1 MeV neutrons delivered at 8 X 10(-4) Gy/min showed 7 times the effectiveness of chronic gamma irradiation. Administration of tritiated water (from 37 to 37 X 10(2) kBq/g b.w.) to rats entailed a risk of the same order of magnitude as external chronic gamma irradiation. Reduction of genetic risk was achieved by pretreatment with either AFT-, ATP-serotonin mixtures or the molecular combinations, Adeturon and Cytriphos. Study of interspecies differences in genetic radiosensitivity showed decline in the following order: rat-rabbit-mouse-Syrian hamster. A dose-rate effect was most clearly seen in the rat, and least clearly in the rabbit. In female mice, examination of oocyte depletion indicated primary follicles to be highly susceptible to acute gamma irradiation; decrease in sensitivity was observed beginning with stage 4.

A propensity-matched analysis, incorporating preoperative variables, was used to compare localization and surgical outcomes between the two groups., RESULTS: After matching, a total of 90 patients in the AFB group (N = 30) and CT-guided group (N = 60) were selected for analysis. No significant difference was noted in the demographic data between both the groups. Dye localization was successfully performed in 29 patients (96.7%) and 57 patients (95%) with AFB and CT-guided method, respectively.

No major procedure-related complications occurred in either group; however, a higher rate of pneumothorax (0 vs. 16.7%, p = 0.029) and focal intrapulmonary hemorrhage (3.3 vs. 26.7%, p = 0.008) was noted in the CT-guided group., CONCLUSION: AFB dye marking is an effective alternative for the preoperative localization of small pulmonary lesions, with a lower risk of procedure-related complications than the conventional CT-guided method.",Excluded
1771,"Pleomorphic adenomas: post-operative radiotherapy is unnecessary following primary incomplete excision: a retrospective review. BACKGROUND: Current standard treatment of Pleomorphic Salivary Adenoma (PSA) of the Parotid Gland is by surgical excision. The management of incomplete excision remains undecided with post-operative radiotherapy advocated by some and observation by others., METHODS: 190 patients who underwent resection of PSA of the parotid gland within the West of Scotland region from 1981 to 2008 were identified and data collected., RESULTS: 78/190 patients had a primary incomplete excision. 25/78 received post-operative radiotherapy and 53 were observed. Recurrences occurred in 11/53 in those observed and in 1/25 of those who received radiotherapy. 21/25 complained of significant side effects from the radiotherapy. 38 surgeons performed 190 procedures, with a range of experience from 1 to28 procedures., CONCLUSIONS: Radiotherapy does appear to reduce recurrence with incomplete excision, however it is associated with significant side effects. We therefore feel radiotherapy should not be routinely recommended. Subspecialisation should be adopted to increase the operating surgeon's experience.

3123,"Variability of radiation doses of cardiac diagnostic imaging tests: the RADIO-EVINCI study (RADIationdOse subproject of the EVINCI study). BACKGROUND: Patients with coronary artery disease can accumulate significant radiation dose through repeated exposures to coronary computed tomographic angiography, myocardial perfusion imaging with single photon emission computed tomography or positron emission tomography, and to invasive coronary angiography. Aim of the study was to audit radiation doses of coronary computed tomographic angiography, single photon emission computed tomography, positron emission tomography and invasive coronary angiography in patients enrolled in the prospective, randomized, multi-centre European study-EVINCI (Evaluation of Integrated Cardiac Imaging for the Detection and Characterization of Ischemic Heart Disease)., METHODS: We reviewed 1070 tests (476 coronary computed tomographic angiographies, 85 positron emission tomographies, 310 single photon emission computed tomographies, 199 invasive coronary angiographies) performed in 476 patients (mean age 60 +/- 9 years, 60% males) enrolled in 12 centers of the EVINCI. The effective doses were calculated in milli-Sievert (mSv) as median, interquartile range (IQR) and coefficient of variation of the mean., RESULTS: Coronary computed tomographic angiography (476 exams in 12 centers) median effective dose was 9.6 mSv (IQR = 13.2 mSv); single photon emission computed tomography (310 exams in 9 centers) effective dose was 9.3 (IQR = 2.8); positron emission tomography (85 in 3 centers) effective dose 1.8 (IQR = 1.6) and invasive coronary angiography (199 in 9 centers) effective dose 7.4 (IQR = 7.3). Inter-institutional variability was highest for invasive coronary angiography (100%) and coronary computed tomographic angiography (54%) and lowest for single photon emission computed tomography (20%). Intra-institutional variability was highest for invasive coronary angiography (121%) and coronary computed tomographic angiography (115%) and lowest for single photon emission computed tomography (14%)., CONCLUSION: Coronary computed tomographic angiography and invasive coronary angiography doses vary substantially between and within centers. The variability in nuclear medicine procedures is substantially lower. The findings highlight the need to audit doses, to track cumulative exposures and to standardize doses for imaging techniques., TRIAL REGISTRATION: The study protocol is available at https://www.clinicaltrials.gov/ (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT00979199 ).

Limb-salvage surgery has become a safe and well-established alternative to amputations for malignant tumors of the proximal humerus. The authors describe six cases with favorable restoration of the upper limb following tumor resection type IB Malawer and proximal humeral reconstruction by vascularized fibula graft (VFG) as a primary or secondary procedure. A scapulofibular arthrodesis was elected in all cases. A special custom-made plate was used in four cases. One patient required a latissimus dorsi musculocutaneous flap for better coverage. Serial x-rays assessed the bone union. Neither flap necrosis nor sepsis phenomena were noted. Stress fracture was the only complication. This was encountered in two cases. Every patient was reviewed and assessed by the Enneking score. The average score was 21.8. The average follow-up was 5-years.

2109,"The feasibility of evaluating radiation dose to the heart by integrating kilovoltage-cone beam computed tomography in stereotactic body radiotherapy of early non-small-cell lung cancer patients. BACKGROUND: To investigate the feasibility of contouring the planning risk organ volume (PRV) for the heart, and to determine the probability of evaluating radiation dose to the heart using kilovoltage-cone beam computed tomography (kV-CBCT) in early-stage non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients, who received stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT)., MATERIALS AND METHODS: Seventeen NSCLC patients who received SBRT (5Gy/f x 10f dose) were enrolled and subjected to CBCT and CT imaging analyses to plan treatment. Sequential planning CBCT images of individual patient's hearts were analyzed for reproducibility of heart contouring and volume. Comparative analyses were made between the planning CT- and CBCT-detected heart margins and dose-volume indices for treatment., RESULTS: The heart volume from planning CT images was significantly smaller than that from CBCT scans (p < 0.05), and the volumes based on the different series of CBCT images were similar (p > 0.05). The overlap of the heart region on the same anatomical section between the first series of CBCT scans and other scans reached 0.985 +/- 0.020 without statistically significant differences (p > 0.05). The mean margins of the heart from planning CT and CBCT scans were 10.5 +/- 2.8 mm in the left direction, 5.9 +/- 2.8 mm in the right direction, 2.2 +/- 1.6 mm in the direction of the head, 3.3 +/- 2.2 mm in the direction of the foot, 6.7 +/- 1.1 mm in the anterior direction, and 4.5 mm +/- 2.5 mm in the posterior direction. All relative and absolute dose-volume indices obtained from CBCT images were significantly larger than those from planning CT scans (p < 0.05), with the exception of the volume in the 5Gy region., CONCLUSION: The PRV of heart contouring based on kV-CBCT is feasible with good reproducibility. More accurate and objective dose-volume indices may be obtained for NSCLC patients by using kV-CBCT, instead of CT, to plan SBRT.",Excluded
254,"Acute toxicity in pelvic radiotherapy; a randomised trial of conformal versus conventional treatment. BACKGROUND: A prospective, randomized clinical trial to assess the effect of reducing the volume of irradiated normal tissue on acute reactions in pelvic radiotherapy accured 266 evaluable patients between 1988 and 1993., PURPOSE: This is the definitive analysis to assess the differences between the conformal and conventional arms of the trial., MATERIALS AND METHODS: In both arms, patients were treated with 6 MV X-rays using a 3-field technique (in all but 5 cases) consisting of an anterior and two wedged lateral or posterior oblique fields; in the conventional arm, rectangular fields were employed, whereas in the conformal arm, the fields were shaped with customized blocks drawn according to the beam's-eye-view of the target volume. The most common dosage was 64 Gy in 2-Gy fractions 5 times a week, although a subgroup (of ca. bladder patients) were treated with 30-36 Gy in once-a-week 6 Gy fractions. Each patients completed a comprehensive acute toxicity scoring questionnaire concentrating on bowel and bladder problems, tiredness and nausea, before the start of treatment, weekly during and for 3 weeks after the end of treatment and then monthly for a further 2 months. compliance was excellent., RESULTS: There were no differences between the patients in the two arms with respect to age, gender, tumour type (52% prostate, 41% bladder, 5% rectum, 2% other) fractionation/dosage, anterior field size, weight, or baseline symptoms. Substantial differences in normal-tissue volumes (rectum, bladder, etc.) were achieved: median high-dose volume (HDV) of 689 cm3 for the conformal technique versus 792 cm3 for the conventional. A clear pattern of an increase in symptoms during RT, followed by a decrease after RT, was observed for the patient group as a whole. However, a very extensive analysis has not revealed any (statistically) significant differences between the two arms in level of symptoms, nor in medication prescribed. The disparity between our findings and those of other, non-randomized studies is discussed., CONCLUSIONS: The data on late effects must be collected and analyzed before any definite conclusions can be drawn on the benefits of conformal therapy in the pelvis.",Excluded
165,"Dopaminergic Modulation of Sensory Attenuation in Parkinson's Disease: Is There an Underlying Modulation of Beta Power?. Background and Aims: Pathological high amplitude of beta oscillations is thought as the underlying mechanism of motor symptoms in Parkinson's disease (PD), in particular with regard to bradykinesia. In addition, abnormality in a neurophysiological phenomenon labeled sensory attenuation has been found in patients with PD. The current study explored the hypothesis that the abnormal sensory attenuation has a causal link with the typical abnormality in beta oscillations in PD. Method(s): The study tested sixteen right-handed patients with a diagnosis of PD and 22 healthy participants, which were matched by age and gender. Somatosensory evoked potentials were elicited through electrical stimulation of the median nerve at the wrist. Electrical activity was recorded at the scalp using a 128 channels EEG. Somatosensory evoked potentials were recorded in 2 conditions: at rest and at the onset of a voluntary movement, which was a self-paced abduction movement of the right thumb. Result(s): Healthy participants showed a reduction of the N20-P25 amplitude at the onset of the right thumb abduction compared to the rest condition (P < 0.05). When patients were OFF medication, they showed mild reduction of the N20-P25 component at movement onset (P < 0.05). On the contrary, they did show greater attenuation of the N20-P25 component at the onset of movement compared to the rest condition when ON medication (P < 0.05). There was no significant evidence of a link between the degree of sensory attenuation and the change in beta oscillations in our cohort of patients. Conclusion(s): These results confirmed a significant link between dopaminergic modulation and sensory attenuation. However, the sensory attenuation and beta oscillations were found as two independent phenomena.© Copyright © 2019 Macerollo, Limousin, Korlipara, Foltynie, Edwards and Kilner.",Excluded
3511,"Synchronous Chemoradiotherapy in Patients with Locally Advanced Squamous Cell Carcinoma of the Head and Neck using Capecitabine: A Single-centre, Open-label, Single-group Phase II Study. Aim: To evaluate the efficacy of concurrent oral capecitabine with accelerated hypofractionated radical radiotherapy in locally advanced squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck (SCCHN). Material(s) and Method(s): Between 2001 and 2004, 50 patients with stage III/IV SCCHN (0 to 2 performance status) were enrolled into this study. The capecitabine dose was between 450 and 550mg/m2 twice daily, continuously for 28 days. The radiotherapy dose was 5500cGy in 20 fractions over 4 weeks. No intensity-modulated radiation was used. We evaluated the complete response rate, toxicity, locoregional control, overall survival, disease-free survival and cancer-specific survival. Result(s): The median age was 55 (range 38-76) years; 72% had stage IV disease. The median follow-up was 6 years on the 30 surviving patients. Eighty-two per cent of patients completed the course of capecitabine and 94% completed prescribed radiotherapy. There were no treatment-related deaths, grade 3/4 haematological or renal toxicity. Five patients developed drug-related grade 3/4 acute toxicity (cardiac, skin, bowel); 47 developed grade 3/4 mucositis from chemoradiotherapy. Twenty-two (44%) patients required tube feeding and the tube dependency rate at 1 year was 6%. The complete response rate at 3 months was 90% (45/50 patients). Relapse occurred in 17/50 (34%) patients by 5 years. The locoregional control, overall survival, cancer-specific survival and disease-free survival rates at 3 years were 78, 72, 82 and 62%, respectively, and at 5 years were 72, 64, 75 and 56%, respectively. Conclusion(s): This schedule of synchronous capecitabine for locally advanced SCCHN is well tolerated. The local control in this series compares favourably with other synchronous chemoradiotherapy reports. Chronic dysphagia and tube dependence is uncommon with this approach. Capecitabine as targeted therapy given with each fraction of radiotherapy and administered orally may have significant advantages over intravenous, 3 weekly cisplatin. © 2010 The Royal College of Radiologists.",Excluded

1110,"Simplified screening for immune complexes by laser nephelometry of ultracentrifuged serum. Serum samples were drawn from 14 healthy volunteers after an overnight fast and again after a meal. Each sample was divided into two aliquots. One aliquot was centrifuged at 20,000 rpm for 20 min, and a portion from the middle of the tube was removed by puncturing the tube's side. All samples were then added to cuvettes containing 0.14 M NaCl alone or 1, 2, 3, or 4% polyethylene glycol in 0.15 M KCl. The light scattering of each tube was measured. The centrifuged samples scattered 58% less light than the uncentrifuged controls. The range of values obtained with the centrifuged samples was also smaller as reflected in the standard deviation of the means obtained at each polyethylene glycol concentration. The coefficient of variation for replicate samples ranged from 0 to 16.6% (mean 5.8%), even when samples were processed differently. Storage at -70 degrees C significantly increased light scattering compared to baseline values. Serum samples were drawn from 44 patients with diseases that have been associated with immune complexes. Nephelometry selectively identified some groups of patients as abnormal. We conclude that preparative ultracentrifugation removes much of the background light scattering of serum samples, including that due to lipid, under conditions that do not sediment out immune complexes. Because it measures a physical property of immune complexes, this assay may provide information that is not available from biological receptor-based assays.",Excluded

(1) Background: The purpose of this study is to evaluate the impact of an augmented reality navigation system (SIRIO) for percutaneous biopsies and ablative treatments on bone lesions, compared to a standard CT-guided technique. (2) Methods: Bioptic and ablative procedures on bone lesions were retrospectively analyzed. All procedures were divided into SIRIO and Non-SIRIO groups and in <2 cm and >2 cm groups. Number of CT-scans, procedural time and patient's radiation dose were reported for each group. Diagnostic accuracy was obtained for bioptic procedures. (3) Results: One-hundred-ninety-three procedures were evaluated: 142 biopsies and 51 ablations. Seventy-four biopsy procedures were performed using SIRIO and 68 under standard CT-guidance; 27 ablative procedures were performed using SIRIO and 24 under standard CT-guidance. A statistically significant reduction in the number of CT-scans, procedural time and radiation dose was observed for percutaneous procedures performed using SIRIO, in both <2 cm and >2 cm groups. The greatest difference in all variables examined was found for procedures performed on lesions <2 cm. Higher diagnostic accuracy was found for all SIRIO-assisted biopsies. No major or minor complications occurred in any procedures. (4) Conclusion(s): The use of SIRIO significantly reduces the number of CT-scans, procedural time and patient's radiation dose in CT-guided percutaneous bone procedures, particularly for lesions <2 cm. An improvement in diagnostic accuracy was also achieved in SIRIO-assisted biopsies.Copyright © 2021 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.",Excluded
2699,"Application of an artificial neural network model for early outcome prediction of gamma knife radiosurgery in patients with trigeminal neuralgia and determining the relative importance of risk factors. Objectives: Stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) is a minimally invasive modality for the treatment of trigeminal neuralgia (TN). Outcome prediction of this modality is very important for proper case selection. The aim of this study was to create artificial neural networks (ANN) to predict the clinical outcomes after gamma knife radiosurgery (GKRS) in patients with TN, based on preoperative clinical factors. Patients and Methods: We used the clinical findings of 155 patients who were underwent GKRS (from March 2000 to march 2015) at Iran Gamma Knife center, Teheran, Iran. Univariate analysis was performed for a long list of risk factors, and those with P-Value < 0.2 were used to create back-propagation ANN models to predict pain reduction and hypoesthesia after GKRS. Pain reduction was defined as BNI score 3a or lower and hypoesthesia was defined as BNI score 3 or 4. Result(s): Typical trigeminal neuralgia (TTN) (P-Value = 0.018) and age>65 (P-Value = 0.040) were significantly associated with successful pain reduction and three other variables including radiation dosage >85 (P-Value = 0.098), negative history of diabetes mellitus (P-Value = 0.133) and depression (P-Value = 0.190). On the other hand, radio dosage>85 (P-Value = 0.008) was significantly associated with hypoesthesia, other related risk factors (with p-Value<0.2), were history of multiple sclerosis (P-Value = 0.106), pain duration more than 10 years before GKRS (P-Value = 0.115), history of depression (P-Value = 0.139), history of percutaneous ablative procedures (P-Value = 0.148) and history of diabetes mellitus (P-Value = 0.169).ANN models could predict pain reduction and hypoesthesia with the accuracy of 84.5% and 91.5% respectively. By mutual elimination of each factor in this model we could also evaluate the contribution of each factor in the predictive performance of ANN. Conclusion(s): The findings show that artificial neural networks can predict post operative outcomes in patients who underwent GKRS with a high level of accuracy. Also the contribution of each factor in the prediction of outcomes can be determined using the trained network.Copyright © 2018",Excluded

Objective: Our aim was to analyze association of diurnal variations of blood pressure with all-cause and cardiovascular (CV) mortality in patients undergoing chronic hemodialysis during a follow-up of 48 months. Design and method: A total of 126 HD patients (74m 52w; average age 61.5+/-15.8) were enrolled. All patients were dialysed by European and KDIGO guidelines. ABPM (24-hours) was performed with SpaceLab 90207 after mid-week dialysis; pulse wave velocity (PWV) and aortic augmentation index (AIx) were measured using Arteriograph after mid-week dialysis. Malnutritioninflammation score (MIS) and protein energy wasting (PEW) score were calculated in all enrolled patients. There were 67.6% of patients without prior CV disease, and prior coronary heart disease, valvular disease, atrial fibrillation, stroke, and peripheral arterial disease were diagnosed in 7.1%, 5,6%, 4.7%, 8.7%, 3.9% patients, respectively. Prior diabetes and prior hypertension were diagnosed in 26.2% and 92.4%, respectively. Result(s): There were 74.6% of non-dippers, while white coat hypertension and masked hypertension were diagnosed in 25.4% and 7.9%, respectively. During the follow up period of 48 months 69 patients died from all-cause and 53 from CV mortality. Diurnal variations of blood pressure were not associated with all-cause mortality. Neither white-coat nor masked hypertension were associated with all-cause mortality. Patients with arterio-venous fistula showed significantly better survival when compared to patients with permanent dialysis catheters and in the linear regression model MIS/PEW and PWV were the only predictors of longer survival (b =-0.371, p = 0.001; b =-0.249, p = 0.009). Conclusion(s): Blood pressure characteristics (ABPM) were not predictors of allcause mortality in patients undergoing chronic hemodialysis. On contrary, arterial stiffness and malnutrition were associated with shorter survival. Observed better survival of patients with A-V fistula compared to patients with permanent catheter is very probably reverse epidemiology.

184,"'A comparative study using conventional concomitant chemoradiotherapy (using cisplatin-based chemotherapy) with accelerated (six fractions a week) chemoradiotherapy in inoperable or nonresectable locally advanced non-small cell lung cancers:' A prospective randomized trial. Context: The conventional concomitant chemoradiotherapy (CCRT) is the standard treatment for locally advanced non-small cell lung cancer. Accelerated CCRT results in shortening of overall treatment time which can contribute in controlling accelerated tumor repopulation. The increase in tumor control probability (TCP) can be expected with no or little effect on late normal tissue injury for a given total dose. Aim(s): The aim of this study was to compare the disease response, toxicity profile, quality of life (QoL), and overall survival in accelerated versus conventional CCRT. Subjects and Methods: Total 42 patients were randomized into two groups - study group (n = 21): Accelerated CCRT, radiation was given as 6 fractions per week (60 Gy/5 weeks/30#) with injection cisplatin 20 mg/m2intravenous (iv) days 1-5 and days 29-33 + injection etoposide 50 mg/m2iv days 1-5 and days 29-33 and control group (n = 21): Conventional CCRT, radiation was given as 5 fractions per week (60 Gy/6 weeks/30#) along with the same chemotherapy. External beam radiation therapy was delivered by cobalt-60 machines. Result(s): The overall response rate (complete and partial response) for all patients was 66.6%. In the control group, it was 66.2%, and in the study group, it was 66.6%. Grade >=II pulmonary, hematological, and esophageal toxicities were seen in 57%, 43%, and 24% in patients of the control group and 53%, 53%, and 33% in the study group, respectively.

1015,"Prescription dose and fractionation predict improved survival after stereotactic radiotherapy for brainstem metastases. Background: Brainstem metastases represent an uncommon clinical presentation that is associated with a poor prognosis. Treatment options are limited given the unacceptable risks associated with surgical resection in this location. However, without local control, symptoms including progressive cranial nerve dysfunction are frequently observed. The objective of this study was to determine the outcomes associated with linear accelerator-based stereotactic radiotherapy or radiosurgery (SRT/SRS) of brainstem metastases. Method(s): We retrospectively reviewed 38 tumors in 36 patients treated with SRT/SRS between February 2003 and December 2011. Treatment was delivered with the CyberknifeTM or TrilogyTM radiosurgical systems. The median age of patients was 62 (range: 28-89). Primary pathologies included 14 lung, 7 breast, 4 colon and 11 others. Sixteen patients (44%) had received whole brain radiation therapy (WBRT) prior to SRT/SRS; ten had received prior SRT/SRS at a different site (28%). The median tumor volume was 0.94 cm3 (range: 0.01-4.2) with a median prescription dose of 17 Gy (range: 12-24) delivered in 1-5 fractions. Result(s): Median follow-up for the cohort was 3.2 months (range: 0.4-20.6). Nineteen patients (52%) had an MRI follow-up available for review. Of these, one patient experienced local failure corresponding to an actuarial 6-month local control of 93%. Fifteen of the patients with available follow-up imaging (79%) experienced intracranial failure outside of the treatment volume. The median time to distant intracranial failure was 2.1 months. Six of the 15 patients with distant intracranial failure (40%) had received previous WBRT. The actuarial overall survival rates at 6- and 12-months were 27% and 8%, respectively. Predictors of survival included Graded Prognostic Assessment (GPA) score, greater number of treatment fractions, and higher prescription dose. Three patients experienced acute treatment-related toxicity consisting of nausea (n = 1) and headaches (n = 2) that resolved with a short-course of dexamethasone. Conclusion(s): SRT/SRS for brainstem metastases is safe and achieves a high rate of local control. We found higher GPA as well as greater number of treatment fractions and higher prescription dose to be correlated with improved overall survival. Despite this approach, prognosis remains poor and distant intracranial control remains an issue, even in patients previously treated with WBRT. © 2012 Leeman et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",Excluded
549,"Determinants of radiation dose during right transradial access: Insights from the RAD-MATRIX study. BACKGROUND: The RAD-MATRIX trial reported a large operator radiation exposure variability in right radial percutaneous coronary procedures. The reasons of these differences are not well understood. Our aim was to appraise the determinants of operator radiation exposure during coronary right transradial procedures., METHODS: Patient arrangement during transradial intervention was investigated across operators involved in the RAD-MATRIX trial. Operator radiation exposure was analyzed according to the position of the patient right arm (close or far from the body) and in relation to the size of the upper leaded glass., RESULTS: Among the 14 operators who agreed to participate, there was a greater than 10-fold difference in radiation dose at thorax level (from 21.5 to 267 muSv) that persisted after normalization by dose-area product (from 0.35 to 3.5 muSv/Gy*cm2). Among the operators who positioned the instrumented right arm far from the body (110.4 muSv, interquartile range 71.5-146.5 muSv), thorax dose was greater than that in those who placed the instrumented arm close to the right leg (46.1 muSv, 31.3-56.8 muSv, P = .02). This difference persisted after normalization by dose-area product (P = .028). The use of a smaller full glass shield was also associated with a higher radiation exposure compared with a larger composite shield (147.5 and 60 muSv, respectively, P = .016)., CONCLUSIONS: In the context of the biggest radiation study conducted in patients undergoing transradial catheterization, the instrumented right arm arrangement close to the leg and greater upper leaded shield dimensions were associated with a lower operator radiation exposure. Our findings emphasize the importance of implementing simple preventive measures to mitigate the extra risks of radiation exposure with right radial as compared with femoral access.

700,"Efficacy analysis of pedicle screw internal fixation of fractured vertebrae in the treatment of thoracolumbar fractures. The present study aimed to discuss the method and effect of posterior internal fixation of thoracolumbar fractures strengthened by the vertical stress pedicle screw fixation of fractured vertebrae. Patients with single thoracolumbar fractures were examined retrospectively. Fourteen patients (group A) had been treated with vertical stress pedicle screw fixation of a fractured vertebra and sixteen patients (group B) received traditional double-plate fixation, as a control. All patients were diagnosed with fresh fractures with a complete unilateral or bilateral pedicle and no explosion of the inferior half of the vertebral body or inferior endplate. In group A, patients received conventional posterior distraction and lumbar lordosis restoration, as well as pedicle screws in the fractured vertebra in a vertical direction to relieve stress to achieve a local stress balance. All patients were followed up postoperatively for 4-18 months (average, 12.6 months). The vertical stress pedicle screw fixation assisted in the reduction of vertebrae fracture, which reduced the postoperative Cobb's angle loss. There was a significant difference in the change of Cobb's angle between the two groups one year after surgery (P<0.01). Conditional application of pedicle screws in a single thoracolumbar fracture enhances the stability of the internal fixation system and is conducive to the correction of kyphosis and maintenance of the corrective effects.",Excluded

OBJECTIVES: To investigate the correlation between ""target-lesion"" SYNTAX score (tSS) and radiation dose (RD) and examine the predictive value of tSS and other variables on RD from percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI)., BACKGROUND: The complexity of PCI influences procedural RD. The novel tSS was utilized to quantify targeted-PCI complexity., METHODS: We studied 420 consecutive patients who had PCI in our hospital. Two investigators independently measured tSS using the SYNTAX scoring algorithm. Patients were divided into three BMI (kg/m(2) ) subgroups: <25 (normal), 25-30 (overweight), and >30 (obese); and tSS tertiles: <5.5 (simple), 5.5-9 (moderate), and >9 (complex)., RESULTS: Obese patients were significantly younger and likely to have diabetes mellitus (DM). tSS positively correlated with RD for both genders, with median RD significantly higher in males (P < 0.0001). tSS correlated with RD in all three BMI subgroups (all P < 0.0001). Multivariate linear regression showed RD can be predicted by the formula: RD = -898 + 18 tSS + 49 BMI + 142 DM + 207 male., CONCLUSIONS: We report that tSS is a quantitative index of ""target-lesion"" PCI complexity, which is easy to measure with good reproducibility. tSS significantly and independently correlates with RD, although the strength of the association is less than for other predictors of RD (gender, diabetes, and BMI). tSS may be used to determine the RD from PCI and enhance patient risk-stratification when formulating a PCI strategy.

2209,"Comparison of AO Titanium Locking Plate and Screw Fixation versus Anterograde Intramedullary Fixation for Isolated Unstable Metacarpal and Phalangeal Fractures. Objective: This study aimed to compare the clinical and radiologic outcomes of AO titanium locking plate and screw (ATLPS) and anterograde intramedullary (AIM) fixation for treating unstable metacarpal and phalangeal fractures. Method(s): Adult patients with isolated fresh unstable metacarpal and phalangeal fractures who met the inclusion criteria were enrolled into this prospective study from July 2013. Patients were divided into ATLPS or AIM groups when they were admitted to our department after considering their work requirement, fracture complexity, and surgeon's experience and were then treated accordingly. Relevant demographic, clinical and preoperative clinical data were collected and analyzed. Clinical examination and radiograph evaluation were performed 1 week and 1, 3, and 6 months postoperatively. Outcome measures were visual analog scale (VAS) scores for pain, total range of motion (ROM) of the injured digit, Quick Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder, and Hand scores (Quick-DASH) and grip strength (percentage of the contralateral corresponding digit). Result(s): From July 2013 to September 2014, 76 patients were treated by AIM and 71 by ATLPS. Age, sex, time from injury to operation, dominant hand, injury mechanism, fracture location, fracture type and participant occupation were similar in both groups (P > 0.05). Operations were all performed well and followed by uneventful postoperative functional recoveries. At 3-month follow-up, all clinical outcomes were significantly better in the AIM than ATLPS group (P < 0.05) except for VAS pain scores. However, at 6-month follow-up, the differences were no longer significant, indicating similar results for both types of fixation. Patients in the AIM group developed significantly more complications (P = 0.037). Sick leave was significantly longer in the AIM group (P = 0.02). Conclusion(s): AIM outperforms ATLPS in the treatment of unstable metacarpal and phalangeal fractures in the early, but not the later, postoperative period; the latter is associated with significantly more complications. Patients treated by ATLPS require shorter sick leave, which is of particular benefit to workers with specialized manual skills.Copyright © 2016 Chinese Orthopaedic Association and John Wiley & Sons Australia, Ltd",Excluded

764,"Raw data-based iterative reconstruction in body CTA: evaluation of radiation dose saving potential. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate prospectively, in patients undergoing body CTA, the radiation dose saving potential of raw data-based iterative reconstruction as compared to filtered back projection (FBP)., METHODS: Twenty-five patients underwent thoraco-abdominal CTA with 128-slice dual-source CT, operating both tubes at 120 kV. Full-dose (FD) images were reconstructed with FBP and were compared to half-dose (HD) images with FBP and HD-images with sinogram-affirmed iterative reconstruction (SAFIRE), both reconstructed using data from only one tube-detector-system. Image quality and sharpness of the aortic contour were assessed. Vessel attenuation and noise were measured, contrast-to-noise-ratio was calculated., RESULTS: Noise as image quality deteriorating artefact occurred in 24/25 (96%) HD-FBP but not in FD-FBP and HD-raw data-based iterative reconstruction datasets (p < 0.001). Other artefacts occurred with similar prevalence among the datasets. Sharpness of the aortic contour was higher for FD-FBP and HD-raw data-based iterative reconstruction as compared to HD-FBP (p < 0.001). Aortoiliac attenuation was similar among all datasets (p > 0.05). Lowest noise was found for HD-raw data-based iterative reconstruction (7.23HU), being 9.4% lower than that in FD-FBP (7.98HU, p < 0.05) and 30.8% lower than in HD-FBP images (10.44HU, p < 0.001). Contrast-to-noise-ratio was lower in HD-FBP (p < 0.001) and higher in HD-raw data-based iterative reconstruction (p < 0.001) as compared to FD-FBP., CONCLUSION: Intra-individual comparisons of image quality of body CTA suggest that raw data-based iterative reconstruction allows for dose reduction >50% while maintaining image quality. Key Points * Raw data-based iterative reconstruction reduces image noise and improves image quality as compared to filtered back projection * At a similar radiation dose, raw data-based iterative reconstruction improves the sharpness of vessel contours * In body CTA a dose reduction of >50% might be possible when using raw data-based iterative reconstructions, while image quality can be maintained.",Excluded
571,"Radiation doses and estimated risk from angiographic projections during coronary angiography performed using novel flat detector. Coronary angiography (CA) procedure uses various angiographic projections to elicit detailed information of the coronary arteries with some steep projections involving high radiation dose to patients. This study intends to evaluate radiation doses and estimated risk from angiographic projections during CA procedure performed using novel flat detector (FD) system with improved image processing and noise reduction techniques. Real-time monitoring of radiation doses using kerma-area product (KAP) meter was performed for 140 patients using Philips Clarity FD system. The CA procedure involved seven standard projections, of which five were extensively selected by interventionalists. Mean fluoroscopic time (FT), KAP, and reference air kerma (Ka,r) for CA procedure were 3.24 min (0.5-10.51), 13.99Gycm2 (4.02-37.6), and 231.43 mGy (73.8-622.15), respectively. Effective dose calculated using Monte Carlo-based PCXMC software was found to be 4.9mSv. Left anterior oblique (LAO) 45degree projection contributed the highest radiation dose (28%) of the overall KAP. Radiation-induced risk was found to be higher in females compared to males with increased risk of lung cancer. An increase of 10%-15% in radiation dose was observed when one or more additional projections were adopted along with the seven standard projections. A 14% reduction of radiation dose was achieved from novel FD system when low-dose protocol during fluoroscopy and medium-dose protocol during cine acquisitions were adopted, compared to medium-dose protocol.",Excluded
2199,"Good genes and the maternal effects of polyandry on offspring reproductive success in the bulb mite. Genetic benefits are potentially the most robust explanation of the controversial issue of evolutionary maintenance of polyandry, but the unambiguous demonstration of such benefits has been hindered by the possibility of their confusion with maternal effects. Previous research has shown that polyandrous bulb mite females produce daughters with higher fecundity than monandrous females. Here, we investigate whether this effect arises because polyandrous females invest more in their offspring, or because their offspring inherit 'good genes' from their fathers. Females were mated with either one or four (different) males. However, by sterilizing three of the four males with ionizing radiation, we eliminated any chance of sexual selection (in the polyandrous treatment) so that any differences in the female mating regimes must have been owing to maternal effects. Polyandry had no significant effect on daughter fecundity, thus indicating that any previously documented effects must have been genetic. This was further supported by a significant association between fathers' offensive sperm-competitive ability and the fecundity of their daughters. The association with fathers' sperm defensive ability was not significant, and neither was the association between fathers' sperm competitiveness and sons' reproductive success. However, sons of polyandrous females had lower reproductive success than sons of monandrous females. This shows that the maternal effects of polyandry should be taken into account whenever its costs and benefits are being considered.",Excluded
1160,"Combined use of automatic tube potential selection with tube current modulation and iterative reconstruction technique in coronary CT angiography. Purpose: To analyze the effect of automatic tube potential selection with tube current modulation (APSCM) and iterative reconstruction on image quality, diagnostic accuracy, and radiation dose at computed tomographic (CT) angiography and compare it with APSCM-only and body mass index (BMI)-based examination protocols. Material(s) and Method(s): This study was approved by the institutional review board, and informed consent was obtained from all patients. Images from 185 patients who underwent a BMI-based protocol and 197 patients who underwent an APSCM protocol with filtered back projection (FBP) and an APSCM protocol with sinogram-affirmed iterative reconstruction (SAFIRE) were retrospectively evaluated. Diagnostic performance was compared with that of conventional coronary angiography in a subgroup of 51 patients. Statistical analysis was performed by using the independent or paired t test, Mann-Whitney U test, Wilcoxon signed rank test, x2 statistics, linear weighted k statistics, and generalized estimating equation. Result(s): The APSCM group with SAFIRE had a significant reduction in image noise and a significant increase in CT number, contrast enhancement, signal-to-noise ratio, and contrast-to-noise ratio compared with the APSCM group with FBP (P < .0001) and the BMI-based group (P < .001, except P = .002 for image noise). Image quality and diagnostic accuracy showed no significant difference between the three groups. The use of APSCM resulted in a significant reduction in radiation dose compared with the BMI-based protocol. Conclusion(s): The combination of SAFIRE and APSCM at coronary CT angiography significantly improves objective image quality while maintaining diagnostic accuracy and reduced radiation dose. © RSNA, 2013.",Excluded

Introduction: Direct isthmic repair is a very effective surgical technique for the treatment of spondylolysis and spondylolisthesis in the young age. This surgical technique compared to the traditional fusion techniques allows to preserve lumbar spine mobility reducing the risk of an adjacent segment disease. Aim of the study was to analyze in a retrospective way patients who underwent direct repair for isthmic spondylolysis in order to evaluate the onset of degenerative diseases or of a vertebral slippage worsening at long-term follow-up. Method(s): From 1996 to 2003 45 patients, 32 males and 13 females, underwent isthmic direct repair. Inclusion criteria were: low grade spondilolysthesis, age ranged between 11 and 25 years, low back pain from at least 6 months and resistant to conservative treatment, no degenerative diseases at the involved and adjacent level. Radiographic evaluation was performed with pre-operative lumbar x-ray and MRI and post-operative lumbar x-ray at regular intervals. In all patients the grade of degeneration at the treated and adjacent level was evaluated with the UCLA classification; the presence of an instability and the spinopelvic harmony value were also evaluated. Result(s): Median age was of 15 years (range 11-25). Median follow-up was of 12 years (10-16). Good clinical outcome was observed in the 98 % of the patients, in 2 patients an hardware failure which requested a surgical revision with a traditional fusion was observed, in 1 patient a spondylodiscitis involving the adjacent level was observed at 7 years follow-up. Radiographic analysis showed no worsening of the vertebral slippage, a complete fusion of the lysis in the 94 % of patients, no bone resorption, no statistically significant variation in the spinopelvic harmony value, a one grade worsening of the UCLA classification value only in the 10 % of patients. In these patients a concomitant alteration of the spinopelvic harmony value was observed. Nor the worsening in the UCLA classification grade none the alteration of the spinopelvic harmony influenced the clinical outcome in our series. Conclusion(s): Direct repair is a valid and reliable surgical treatment possibility for lumbar isthmic spondylolysis. Its use allows, in young symptomatic patients, to preserve the motility of the treated level in order to avoid, at over 10 years follow-up, the onset of degenerative changes to the treated and adjacent discs and zygaphofiseal joints, preserving also, a good spinopelvic harmony)over time.",Excluded
456,"Clinical and molecular recursive partitioning analysis of high-grade glioma treated with IMRT. Introduction: Despite multimodal treatment for high-grade gliomas, prognosis remains grim. Prior Radiation Therapy Oncology Group-Recursive Partitioning Analysis (RTOG-RPA) reports indicate based on pretreatment and treatment-related factors, a subset of patients experience a significantly improved survival. Since the development of the RTOG-RPA, high-grade gliomas have seen the widespread introduction of temozolomide and tumor oncogenetics. Here we aimed to determine whether the RTOG-RPA retained prognostic significance in the context of modern treatment, as well as generate an updated RPA incorporating both clinical and genetic variables. Method(s): Patients with histologically proven glioblastoma, gliosarcoma, anaplastic astrocytoma, and anaplastic oligodendroglioma treated with intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) between 2004 and 2017 were reviewed. The primary endpoint was overall survival from date of diagnosis. Primary analysis compared actual survival rates to that expected of corresponding RTOG-RPA class. Secondary analysis utilized the rpart function to recursively partition overall survival by numerous clinical and genetic pretreatment and treatment-related variables. A tertiary analysis recursively partitioned a subset of patients in which the status of all genetic markers were known. Result(s): We identified 878 patients with histologically proven high-grade glioma treated with IMRT and 291 patients in our genetic subset. Median overall survival for the entire cohort was 14.2 months (95% confidence interval, 13.1-15.3). Applying the RTOG-RPA to our cohort validated the relative prognostic ordering of the survival classes except class II. Generating our new RPA created 7 significantly different survival classes (P<0.001, chi 2 =584) with median survival ranging from 96.4 to 2.9 months based on age, histology, O6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase methylation status, radiation fractions, tumor location, radiation dose, temozolomide status, and resection status. Our second RPA of our genetic subset generated 5 significantly different survival classes (P<0.001, chi 2 =166) with survival ranging from 65.3 to 5.6 months based on age, isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 mutation status, O6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase methylation status, neurological functional classification, hospitalization during IMRT, temozolomide status, and Karnofsky performance status. Conclusion(s): The RTOG-RPA retains partial prognostic significance, however, should be updated to reflect recent advancements. This series represents a large RPA analyzing both clinical and genetic factors and generated 7 distinct survival classes. Further assessment of patients with fully available genetic markers generated 5 distinct survival classes. These survival classifications need to be validated by a prospective data set and compared against the RTOG-RPA to determine whether they provide improved prognostic power.© Copyright 2018 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

OBJECTIVE: We estimated the absorbed doses for (111)In-DTPA-D-Phe(1)-octreotide and (90)Y-DOTA-D-Phe(1)-Tyr(3)-octreotide in the same patients in order to compare the potential effectiveness (tumour dose) and safety (kidney and red marrow dose) of these drugs for peptide-targeted radiotherapy of somatostatin receptor positive tumours., METHODS: Six patients with neuroendocrine tumours underwent quantitative (111)In-DTPA-D-Phe(1)-octreotide SPECT and (86)Y-DOTA-D-Phe(1)-Tyr(3)-octreotide PET scan at intervals of 1 week. All studies were performed with a co-infusion of amino acids for renal protection. PET and SPECT were reconstructed using iterative algorithms, incorporating attenuation and scatter corrections. Tissue uptakes (IA%) were measured and used to calculate residence times. Absorbed doses to tissues were estimated and the maximal allowed activity, defined as either the activity delivering 23 Gy to the kidneys (MAA(K)) or 2 Gy to the red marrow (MAA(RM)), was calculated and the resulting tumour absorbed doses were computed., RESULTS: For the MAA(K) the mean absorbed dose to the red marrow was lower for (90)Y-DOTA-D-Phe(1)-Tyr(3)-octreotide than for (111)In-DTPA-D-Phe(1)-octreotide (1.8+/-0.9 Gy vs. 6.4+/-1.6 Gy; P<0.001). The median absorbed dose to tumours for the MAA(K) was two-fold higher for (90)Y-DOTA-D-Phe(1)-Tyr(3)-octreotide as compared to (111)In-DTPA-D-Phe(1)-octreotide (30.1 vs. 12.6 Gy; P<0.05). The median absorbed dose to tumours estimated for the MAA(RM) was 10-fold higher for (90)Y-DOTA-D-Phe(1)-Tyr(3)-octreotide than for (111)In-DTPA-D-Phe(1)-octreotide (35.1 Gy vs. 3.9 Gy; P<0.05)., CONCLUSIONS: This direct intra-patient comparison confirms that the use of (90)Y-DOTA-D-Phe(1)-Tyr(3)-octreotide is more appropriate for therapy of somatostatin receptor bearing tumours. When using (111)In-DTPA-D-Phe(1)-octreotide, the red marrow represents the major critical organ; this can result in significant toxicity if high activities have to be administered to obtain efficient tumour irradiation.",Excluded

Summary The aim of this study was to assess the impact of F-18 fluorodeoxyglucose-positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) CT on radiotherapy planning parameters for patients treated curatively with radiotherapy for non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Five patients with stages I-III NSCLC underwent a diagnostic FDG-PET CT (dPET CT), planning FDG-PET CT (pPET CT) and a simulation CT (RTP CT). For each patient, three radiation oncologists delineated a gross tumour volume based on RTP CT alone, and fused with dPET CT and pPET CT. Standard expansions were used to generate PTVs, and a 3D conformal plan was created. Normal tissue doses were compared between plans. Coverage of pPET CT PTV by the plans based on RTP CT and dPET CT was assessed, and tumour control probabilities were calculated. Mean PTV was similar between RTP CT, dPET CT and pPET CT, although there were significant inter-observer differences in four patients. The plans, however, showed no significant differences in doses to lung, oesophagus, heart or spinal cord. The RTP CT plan and dPET CT plan significantly underdosed the pPET PTV in two patients with minimum doses ranging from 12 to 63% of prescribed dose. Coverage by the 95% isodose was suboptimal in these patients, but this did not translate into poorer tumour control probability. The effect of fused FDG-PET varied between observers. The addition of dPET and pPET did not significantly change the radiotherapy planning parameters. Although FDG-PET is of benefit in tumour delineation, its effect on normal tissue complication probability and tumour control probability cannot be predicted.",Excluded

Therapeutic decisions, as with any other manifestation of CAD, relate to the extent of myocardium at jeopardy and to the overall diffuseness of CAD. Management options possible are PTCA or coronary artery bypass surgery. The latter may be required in left main artery stenosis and complicated ostial lesions.

PURPOSE: To characterize, at the histopathologic and molecular levels, the irradiated epidermis in cases of human skin fibrosis induced by radiotherapy., METHODS AND MATERIALS: Surgical samples were obtained from 6 patients who had developed cutaneous fibronecrotic lesions from 7 months to 27 years after irradiation. The proliferation and differentiation status of the irradiated epidermis was characterized with specific markers using immunohistochemical methods., RESULTS: All samples presented with hyperplasia of the epidermis associated with local inflammation. The scar epidermis exhibited an increased expression of proliferating cell nuclear antigen, which revealed hyperproliferation of keratinocytes. Furthermore, an abnormal differentiation was found, characterized by the expression of K6 and K16, and by alterations in protein amounts and localization of cytokeratins, involucrin, and transforming growth factor-beta1., CONCLUSION: These results demonstrate that late damage of irradiated skin is not only characterized by fibrosis in the dermis but also by hyperplasia in the epidermis.

Background: Actinic cheilitis (AC) is a potentially malignant disorder of the lip caused by exposure to solar radiation. Objective(s): This study was conducted to evaluate the clinicopathologic profile of cases of AC and to verify associations with the degree of dysplasia. Method(s): This retrospective study analyzed data for 40 patients with AC. Demographic, clinical, and histopathologic data were evaluated. Sections measuring 5 mum in thickness were cut, deparaffinized, and stained with hematoxylin and eosin for histologic examination. The degree of epithelial dysplasia was graded using the criteria defined by the World Health Organization. Two calibrated oral pathologists analyzed the slides. Result(s): Analysis of the AC patients sampled showed that 75.0% were male (P = 0.002), 80.0% were aged >=40 years (P < 0.001), 74.3% were Caucasian (P = 0.004), and 68.6% had occupational exposure to sunlight (P = 0.028).

Objective: To investigate the outcome of linac-based fractionated stereotactic radiotherapy over the last 10 years for intracranial skull base benign meningiomas in patients who were inoperable, who had residual tumors with some components of high mitotic index after surgery and who experienced relapse of the tumor. Method(s): Twenty-seven patients with intracranial skull base benign meningiomas treated with fractionated stereotactic radiotherapy were retrospectively reviewed. Twenty-seven cases were diagnosed as benign meningiomas on pathological (17 cases) or radiological (10 cases) examination. The median follow-up time was 90 months after initial treatment and 63 months after fractionated stereotactic radiotherapy. The median biological equivalent dose calculated using an alpha/beta ratio of 2.0 Gy was 82.0 Gy (range, 60-106 Gy). Result(s): The 5-year overall survival was 95.7 (95% confidence interval: 87.3-100)% after initial treatment and 96.2 (88.8-100)% after fractionated stereotactic radiotherapy. The 5-year overall survival and local control rate of patients who received4/8/2011 fractionated stereotactic radiotherapy alone were both 100%. The 5-year progression-free survival and local control rate after fractionated stereotactic radiotherapy were all 100% with a tumor volume of <9.1 cc and 68.2 (37.2-99.2) and 75.8 (45.2-100)% for the tumors 9.1 cc, respectively. The difference was significant in progression-free survival (P = 0.022) and local control rate (P = 0.044). The local control rate was significantly worse in patients who received fractionated stereotactic radiotherapy for relapsed tumors (P = 0.01). No late radiation damage was observed in the follow-up period. Conclusion(s): The long-term outcome suggests that fractionated stereotactic radiotherapy is a safe and effective treatment for intracranial skull base benign meningioma, especially for those who have tumors <9.1 cc or would receive fractionated stereotactic radiotherapy with or without surgery as the initial treatment. © The Author (2010).

578,"Radiation-associated changes in the length of telomeres in peripheral leukocytes from inpatients with cancer. Purpose: The telomere length of somatic cells shortens with age and with other endogenous and exogenous pathogenic factors. However, the effects of radiation therapy on telomere DNA of non-cancer tissue have not been thoroughly investigated. This study analyzed the telomere length of inpatients with cancer treated with radiation therapy to see whether the telomere lengths change in response to therapeutic radiation. Material(s) and Method(s): Twenty-five patients were enrolled in the study. The patients had lung cancer, prostate cancer, thyroid cancer, hepatoma, or rectal cancer. They received radiation therapy with a dose range of 15-74 Gy. The telomere lengths and telomere length distribution in peripheral leukocytes were analyzed by using a Southern blot-based method. Result(s): The telomere length and the telomere length distribution of the peripheral leukocytes did not change after radiation therapy. However, there was a significant proportional decrease in the short telomere fraction (< 4.4 kb) per day and per Gy. Conclusion(s): This observation suggested that the telomere length distribution of peripheral leukocytes could be affected by radiation therapy, and that the effect of radiation tends to appear in cells with short telomeres. Radiation therapy-associated somatic telomere length change within a short range of time, about three months or shorter, can be detected by analyzing the mean telomere length and telomere length distribution. © 2013 Informa UK, Ltd.",Excluded

Subjective quality was assessed by two experienced radiologists using a 5-point scale (0: non diagnostic-4: excellent) using the 15-segment American Heart Association (AHA) coronary artery classification., RESULTS: Mean effective dose and noise were non significantly different between the two groups: mean effective dose was 2.89 +/- 0.7 mSv in the 100 kV group and 2.80 +/- 0.57 mSv in the 120 kV group (p = 0.25) while noise was 28.9 +/- 3.3 in the 120 kV group and 29.05 +/- 3.6 in the 100 kV group (p = 0.72). Both SNR and CNR were significantly higher in the 100 kV group than in the 120 kV group. This data agrees with the evidence that subjective quality was significantly higher in the 100 kV group in the middle and distal segmental classes., CONCLUSION: Our study shows that, in using a 320 row CCTA with AEC strategy it is better to employ a 100 kV tube voltage protocol because compared to 120 kV tube voltage setting, it appears to significantly improve both subjective and objective image quality without decreasing the mean effective radiation dose.",Excluded
2487,High-dose continuous infusion folinic acid and bolus 5-fluorouracil in patients with advanced colorectal cancer: a phase II study. Encouraging results have recently been reported for studies using folinic acid in combination with 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) in the treatment of patients with gastrointestinal (GI) malignancies. Thirty-six patients with advanced colorectal cancer with unequivocal evidence of progression while treated with fluoropyrimidines were treated with a six-day continuous infusion of 500 mg/m2/d of folinic acid initiated 24 hours before a five-day course of 5-FU administered as an intravenous (IV) bolus of 370 mg/m2/d. An initial dose of 250 mg/m2/d of 5-FU was used in patients previously treated with ionizing radiation and/or a nitrosourea. Three objective partial responses were observed. The overall median duration of survival was 8.1 months. Toxicity was acceptable and not in excess of that expected for 5-FU alone.,Excluded
94,"Evaluating radiation-induced white matter changes in patients treated with stereotactic radiosurgery using diffusion tensor imaging: A pilot study. Stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) has been an effective treatment method for brain tumors; however, few data are available regarding radiation-induced white matter (WM) damage by SRS. In this work, diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) was used to investigate WM changes following SRS. Fifteen patients with gliomas were enrolled, with prescription doses ranging 18-25 Gy. Patients were scanned with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) including DTI before and after SRS. Diffusion tensors were calculated and fiber tracking was performed. Non-irradiated WM volumes and irradiated WM volumes receiving >=12 Gy and >=5 Gy were contoured as volumes of interest (VOI). Apparent diffusion coefficient (), fractional anisotropy (FA) and number of fibers (NF) were calculated and assessed using the Wilcoxon signed-rank test. Compared with those of non-irradiated VOIs, FA and NF decreased considerably after two months of SRS in the irradiated WM VOIs. The variation in was however small and was not statistically significant. The preliminary results suggested that FA and NF might potentially be more sensitive indicators than in measuring radiation-induced WM changes and DTI could be a valuable tool to assess radiation-induced WM changes in SRS. Although it is still preliminary, this pilot study may be useful to provide insights for future studies. © Adenine Press (2014).",Excluded
935,"Clinical protocol: Phase I study to the immunotherapy of metastatic malignant melanoma by a cancer vaccine consisting of autologous cancer cells transfected with the human IL-2 gene. The direct modification of tumor cells using cytokine genes as a strategy to enhance host immunity against cancer has been studied extensively in animal models. Results obtained showed that mice injected with IL-2-transfected cancer cells mount a tumor-specific immune response that is sufficient in magnitude to protect the animals against a challenge with a tumorigenic dose of wild-type parental cancer cells. Currently, trials are ongoing to determine the feasibility of such a treatment in patients with renal cell carcinoma, colon carcinoma and melanoma. We now propose a cancer vaccine trial for stage IV melanoma patients with no hope for cure by either chemotherapy, surgery or irradiation. The vaccine consists of irradiated, autologous melanoma cells which had been genetically engineered by means of receptor-mediated, adenovirus-augmented gene delivery (transferrinfection) to produce human IL-2. Patients receive repeated injections of two different doses of the vaccine and will be monitored for the occurrence of any adverse reactions to it. In addition, we will determine whether the administration of the vaccine induces and/or enhances tumor-specific host responses at the immunological and/or clinical level.",Excluded
861,"Growth factor treatment prior to low-dose total body irradiation increases donor cell engraftment after bone marrow transplantation in mice. Low-toxicity conditioning regimens prior to bone marrow transplantation (BMT) are widely explored. We developed a new protocol using hematopoietic growth factors prior to low-dose total body irradiation (TBI) in recipients of autologous transplants to establish high levels of long-term donor cell engraftment. We hypothesized that treatment of recipient mice with growth factors would selectively deplete stem cells, resulting in successful long-term donor cell engraftment after transplantation. Recipient mice were treated for 1 or 7 days with growth factors (stem cell factor [SCF] plus interleukin 11 [IL-11], SCF plus Flt-3 ligand [FL], or granulocyte colony-stimulating factor [G-CSF]) prior to low-dose TBI (4 Gy). Donor cell chimerism was measured after transplantation of congenic bone marrow cells. High levels of donor cell engraftment were observed in recipients pretreated for 7 days with SCF plus IL-11 or SCF plus FL. Although 1-day pretreatments with these cytokines initially resulted in reduced donor cell engraftment, a continuous increase in time was observed, finally resulting in highly significantly increased levels of donor cell contribution. In contrast, G-CSF treatment showed no beneficial effects on long-term engraftment. In vitro stem cell assays demonstrated the effect of cytokine treatment on stem cell numbers. Donor cell engraftment and number of remaining recipient stem cells after TBI were strongly inversely correlated, except for groups treated for 1 day with SCF plus IL-11 or SCF plus FL. We conclude that long-term donor cell engraftment can be strongly augmented by treatment of recipient mice prior to low-dose TBI with hematopoietic growth factors that act on primitive cells.",Excluded

Background: The present study evaluated the correlation of hepatobiliary toxicity and radiation dose received in patients undergoing neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy (NACRT) for locally advanced unresectable gall bladder cancers (LAGBC). Method(s): Twenty-six patients with LAGBC, treated with NACRT (55-57 Gy/25 fractions/5 weeks and weekly gemcitabine 300 mg/m2) within a phase II study, were included. Whenever feasible, surgery was performed after NACRT. Acute and late hepatobiliary toxicity was recorded. Treatment scans were retrieved to delineate central porto-hepatobiliary system (CPHBS), resected liver surface, segment IV B and V, and duodenum. The doses received by these structures were recorded and correlated with toxicity. Result(s): Of 26 patients, 20 (77%) had partial or complete response and 12 (46%) had R0 resection. At the median follow-up of 38 months, overall survival was 38%. Eight (30%) patients had post-treatment toxicity, of which most common was biliary toxicity (30%). A correlation was observed between the biliary leak and V45Gy CPHBS >50 cm3 (P = 0.070). Higher toxicity was observed in those with metallic stents (P = 0.072). Conclusion(s): The incidence of the biliary leak was 46%. CPHBS dose was found to correlate with biliary leaks. Restricting V45Gy CPHBS <50 cm3 and using plastic stent may facilitate a reduction in hepatobiliary toxicity in patients undergoing NACRT and surgery.",Excluded
2693,"Salivary gland cancer in the United States. The risk of salivary gland cancer (SGC) is increased in atomic bomb survivors and after radiotherapy, but other risk factors are not well established. Some studies have suggested an association of SGC with breast cancer and with exposure to various viruses or UVB radiation. Corroborating evidence of these associations was sought by using population-based registries to examine the demographic distribution of SGC, patterns of secondary primary cancers after SGC, and risk of SGC with AIDS. SGC incidence per 100,000 persons did not change between 1973 and 1992, averaging 1.2 in males and 0.8 in females, with a steep age gradient. To examine the relationship between UVB exposure and SGC, population-based, age-adjusted incidence rates of SGC were plotted against the UVB insolation of each registry site. Regression analysis suggested no correlation between SGC incidence and increasing UVB insolation (beta = 0.10, R2 = 0.08). SGC also did not appear to be associated with second cancers that have been linked to herpes or papilloma viruses or with AIDS [observed/expected (O/E) ratio, <2.8], but all of these conditions are so uncommon that only very large relative risks would have been statistically significant. Women with SGC before age 35 had a statistically nonsignificant elevation in breast cancer risk [O/E, 3.30; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.66-9.65], and older women had no increased risk of breast cancer. SGC patients were at increased risk for nonsalivary, second-primary oropharyngeal cancers (O/E, 3.27; 95% CI, 2.00-5.05), thyroid cancer (O/E, 3.31; 95% CI, 1,07-7.73), and lung cancer (O/E, 1.86; 95% CI, 1.45-2.35), particularly in patients whose SGC was treated with radiotherapy (O/E, 2.83; 95% CI, 2.06-3.80). In summary, SGC remains rare and does not appear to be associated with AIDS, virally related malignancies, or UVB. Patients who have had SGC, however, should be monitored for subsequent oropharyngeal, thyroid, and lung cancers.",Excluded

We also demonstrate that GnRH agonist stimulated recovery of spermatogenesis and fertility not only when the hormone was administered immediately after irradiation, but also at 20 weeks after irradiation, after the decline in spermatogenesis had occurred. These results suggest that GnRH agonist treatment given to azoospermic men after cytotoxic therapy for cancer may stimulate the recovery of spermatogenesis and fertility.",Excluded

Ataxia with oculomotor apraxia (ataxia-telangiectasia-like syndrome [AOA]; MIM 208920) is an autosomal recessive disorder characterized by ataxia, oculomotor apraxia, and choreoathetosis. These neurological features resemble those of ataxia-telangiectasia (AT), but in AOA there are none of the extraneurological features of AT, such as immunodeficiency, neoplasia, chromosomal instability, or sensitivity to ionizing radiation. It is unclear whether these patients have a true disorder of chromosomal instability or a primary neurodegenerative syndrome, and it has not been possible to identify the defective gene in AOA, since the families have been too small for linkage analysis. We have identified a new family with AOA, and we show that the patients have no evidence of chromosomal instability or sensitivity to ionizing radiation, suggesting that AOA in this family is a true primary cerebellar ataxia. We have localized the disease gene, by linkage analysis and homozygosity mapping, to a 15.9-cM interval on chromosome 9q34. This work will ultimately allow the disease gene to be identified and its relevance to other types of autosomal recessive cerebellar ataxias to be determined.",Excluded

1322,"Effects of non-covalent self-association on the subcutaneous absorption of a therapeutic peptide. PURPOSE: To utilize an acylated peptide as a model system to investigate the relationships among solution peptide conformation, non-covalent self-association, subcutaneous absorption and bioavailability under pharmaceutically relevant solution formulation conditions., METHODS: CD spectroscopy, FTIR spectroscopy, equilibrium sedimentation, dynamic light scattering, and size exclusion chromatography were employed to characterize the effects of octanoylation on conformation and self-association of the 31 amino acid peptide derivative des-amino-histidine(7) arginine(26) human glucagon-like peptide (7-37)-OH (IP(7)R(26)GLP-1). Hyperglycemic clamp studies were performed to compare the bioavailability, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamics of solution formulations of oct-IP(7)R(26)GLP-1 administered subcutaneously to normal dogs., RESULTS: Octanoylation of IP(7)R(26)GLP-1 was shown to confer the propensity for a major solvent-induced conformational transition with an accompanying solvent- and temperature-dependent self-association behavior. Formulations were characterized that give rise to remarkably different pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics that correlate with distinct peptide conformational and self-association states. These states correspond to: (i) a minimally associated alpha-helical form (apparent molecular weight = 14 kDa), (ii) a highly associated, predominantly beta-sheet form (effective molecular diameter 20 nm), and (iii) an unusually large, micelle-like soluble beta-sheet aggregate (effective molecular diameter 50 nm)., CONCLUSIONS: Bioavailability and pharmacokinetics of a self-associating peptide can be influenced by aggregate size and the ease of disruption of the non-covalent intermolecular interactions at the subcutaneous site. Hydrophobic aggregation mediated by seemingly innocuous solution formulation conditions can have a dramatic effect on the subcutaneous bioavailability and pharmacokinetics of a therapeutic peptide and in the extreme, can totally preclude its absorption. A size exclusion chromatographic method is identified that distinguishes subcutaneously bioavailable aggregated oct-IP(7)R(26)GLP-1 from non-bioavailable aggregated oct-IP(7)R(26)GLP-1.",Excluded

We investigated the feasibility of simultaneous integrated boost (SIB) volumetric modulated arc therapy (VMAT) using elective nodal irradiation (ENI) for middle or lower esophageal cancer and compared it with three-dimensional conformal radiotherapy (3D-CRT). The study included 15 patients. The prescribed doses included a standard dose (50.4 Gy) and a high dose (60 Gy) for the planning target volume (PTV) of the involved lesions. The objective of the whole lung volume receiving >= 20 Gy (V20Gy) was < 30%, and the mean lung dose (MLD) was < 20 Gy. The volumes of the lung receiving 5 Gy (V5Gy) and the heart receiving 30-50 Gy (V30-50Gy) were kept as low as reasonably achievable. As a result, SIB-VMAT showed superior dose conformity for the PTV (p<0.001). Although the lung V5Gy was significantly increased (p<0.001), the V20Gy and MLD showed no significant increase. The heart V30-50Gy showed a > 20% reduction in the mean against 3D-CRTs. Our results demonstrate the feasibility of SIB-VMAT for the treatment of middle or lower esophageal cancer with ENI.

Introduction and Aims: Intradialytic hypertension with a prevalence of 15% among hemodialysis patients is with unknown pathophysiology, demographic, laboratory and clinical characteristic of patients, and it's influence on long - lasting clinical effects (cardiovascular morbidity and mortality, rate of hospitalization). So, the aim of the study is to present the clinical, laboratory and demographic characteristics of patients with intradialytic hypertension in our dialysis center. Method(s): Of total 110 hemodialysis patients, 17 patients (15,45%) were intradialytic hypertensive - started at a systolic pressure greater than 140 mm Hg or had an increase in systolic pressure more than 10 mm Hg during the session, and 17 patients were normotensive or had a drop in blood pressure during the dialysis. HD were performed 3 times per week with a duration of 4-5 hours, on machines with controlled ultrafiltration and high flux syntetic membrane ( polyetersulfon) sterilized with gamma rays. It was used dialysate with standard electrolytes content (Na+ 138 mmol/L, K+ 2,0 mmol/L, Ca++ 1,5 mmol/L, Mg +1,0 mmol/L, CH3COO- 3,0 mmol/L, Cl -110 mmol/l, HCO3- 35 mmol/L). Analysed demographic and clinical characteristics were: gender, age, BMI, dialysis vintage, vascular acces, cardiovascular comorbidity (cardiomyopathy, ischemic cardiac disease, peripheral artery disease, heart valve disease), number and type of antihypertensive drugs, a weekly dose of erythropoesis - stimulating agent, standard monthly, three and six months laboratory analyzes, and sp Kt/V and PCR. Statistical analysis was performed with SPSS 17.0. Result(s): In the both groups were more men (IDH group 88,23%, control group 64,07%). IDH group was older (59,00+/- 7,64 versus 49.00+/- 13,91, p= 0,314) and with lower BMI (p = 0,246) compared to control group. Significantly lower serum sodium and higher sodium gradient had IDH patients (135,75+/-2,03 versus 137,33 +/-1,97, p= 0,042; 2,25+/-1,98 versus 0,66+/-1,44, p=0,0267, respestively). In other laboratory analysis there was no statistically significant differences between two groups.

Baseline characteristics were collected via a questionnaire, and X-rays of knee and hand joints were scored using a semi-quantitative grading system. The relationship between serum adiponectin levels and radiographic severity was evaluated by linear and logistic regression analysis. Subjects in the higher serum adiponectin levels tertiles were older and had a lower body mass index (BMI) than those in the lower tertiles.

In terms of hand joint scores, no association was found between serum adiponectin levels and the total, osteophyte, JSN, subchondral cyst, sclerosis, erosion, or malalignment score after the above-mentioned adjustments. Similarly, subjects with serum adiponectin levels above the median had higher total radiographic scores in the knee joints, but not in the hand joints, after adjustment.

Background: Radiation based imaging techniques like panoramic radiography, computed tomography (CT) or cone beam computed tomography (CBCT) are currently the standard for depicting the mandibular canal prior to surgical procedures. However, these modalities are lacking sufficient soft tissue visualization of the inferior alveolar nerve (IAN) and the lingual nerve (LN), which is particularly exposed to injury during wisdom tooth removal. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) using dedicated imaging sequences showed promising results in the direct visualization of the IAN and the LN with high spatial resolution and signal-to-noise-ratio (SNR) quantification. The aim of this study was to define standard specifications in MRI which allow for benchmark definition of SNR values in healthy subjects. Method(s): 33 healthy volunteers were examined on a 3T scanner. The conducted sequence protocol consisted of a 3D STIR, 3D WATS and a 3D T1 FFE ""black bone""-sequence. Result(s): The study highlights the feasibility of a direct visualization of proximal and peripheral branches of the IAN and proximal LN. STIR and WATS sequences allowed for morphological discrimination of nerval and vascular components and their anatomical localization within the mandible. The STIR sequence showed significantly higher signalto-noise-ratios for IAN as well as for the LN in the proximal and distal part of the corresponding nerves (p < 0.05). Discussion(s): The data presented in this study reveal, that a direct visualization of the course of the IAN and LN is feasible using high resolution STIR and WATS sequences. Furthermore, the imaging protocol conducted not only allowed for reproducible nerve diameter measurements but also for subsequent calculation of quantitative parameters like aSNR. Conclusion(s): MRI using a dedicated sequence protocol allows for detection, nerve signal quantification and morphological characterization of the course of the IAN and the LN with its variant forms in healthy subjects.",Excluded

However, the optimal schedule of treatment remains to be determined. Method(s): A prospective study was conducted in patients with locally advanced stage IIIA or IIIB NSCLC, to determine the tolerability and local control obtained with 7 weekly courses of concurrent chemo-radiotherapy using Docetaxel (D: 20 mg/m2) or Paclitaxel (P: 60 mg/m2) and TRT (2 Gy daily Monday through Friday, totalizing 70 Gy in the seven weeks), after 3 cycles of cisplatinum-based induction chemotherapy (cisplatinum + gemcitabine +/- vinorelbine). Result(s): From December 1999 to December 2004, fifty two out of 129 patients treated with induction chemotherapy and at least with stable disease were considered eligible for analysis. Twenty seven were treated with docetaxel (D) and twenty five with paclitaxel (P). The average of weeks of treatment was 5 for D (range 7-3) and 6 for P (7-1), and 40% and 58% of patients respectively in each group completed 7 weeks and received the programmed doses. Significant toxicity during concurrent therapy included (D/P %): esophagitis (grade I, 22/18; grade II, 25/29; grade III, 30/8), pneumonitis (grades I-II, 14/5), diarrhea (grades I-II, 14/0).

We examined the mortality risks among 2463 individuals who were exposed in utero to atomic bomb radiation in Hiroshima or Nagasaki in August 1945 and were followed from October 1950 through 2012. Individual estimates of mother's weighted absorbed uterine dose (DS02R1) were used. Poisson regression method was used to estimate the radiation-associated excess relative risk per Gy (ERR/Gy) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for cause-specific mortality. Head size, birth weight, and parents' survival status were evaluated as potential mediators of radiation effect. There were 339 deaths (216 males and 123 females) including deaths from solid cancer (n = 137), lymphohematopoietic cancer (n = 8), noncancer disease (n = 134), external cause (n = 56), and unknown cause (n = 4). Among males, the unadjusted ERR/Gy (95% CI) was increased for noncancer disease mortality (1.22, 0.10-3.14), but not for solid cancer mortality (- 0.18, < - 0.77-0.95); the unadjusted ERR/Gy for external cause mortality was not statistically significant (0.28, < - 0.60-2.36). Among females, the unadjusted ERRs/Gy were increased for solid cancer (2.24, 0.44-5.58), noncancer (2.86, 0.56-7.64), and external cause mortality (2.57, 0.20-9.19). The ERRs/Gy adjusted for potential mediators did not change appreciably for solid cancer mortality, but decreased notably for noncancer mortality (0.39, < - 0.43-1.91 for males; 1.48, - 0.046-4.55 for females) and external cause mortality (0.10, < - 0.57-1.96 for males; 1.38, < - 0.46-5.95 for females). In conclusion, antenatal radiation exposure is a consistent risk factor for increased solid cancer mortality among females, but not among males. The effect of exposure to atomic bomb radiation on noncancer disease and external cause mortality among individuals exposed in utero was mediated through small head size, low birth weight, and parental loss.Copyright © 2021, The Author(s).",Excluded

Purpose and Objectives We report on the clinical outcomes of a phase 2 study assessing image guided hypofractionated weekly radiation therapy in bladder cancer patients unsuitable for radical treatment. Methods and Materials Fifty-five patients with T2-T4aNx-2M0-1 bladder cancer not suitable for cystectomy or daily radiation therapy treatment were recruited. A ""plan of the day"" radiation therapy approach was used, treating the whole (empty) bladder to 36 Gy in 6 weekly fractions. Acute toxicity was assessed weekly during radiation therapy, at 6 and 12 weeks using the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events version 3.0. Late toxicity was assessed at 6 months and 12 months using Radiation Therapy Oncology Group grading. Cystoscopy was used to assess local control at 3 months. Cumulative incidence function was used to determine local progression at 1 at 2 years. Death without local progression was treated as a competing risk. Overall survival was estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method. Results Median age was 86 years (range, 68-97 years). Eighty-seven percent of patients completed their prescribed course of radiation therapy. Genitourinary and gastrointestinal grade 3 acute toxicity was seen in 18% (10/55) and 4% (2/55) of patients, respectively. No grade 4 genitourinary or gastrointestinal toxicity was seen. Grade >=3 late toxicity (any) at 6 and 12 months was seen in 6.5% (2/31) and 4.3% (1/23) of patients, respectively. Local control after radiation therapy was 92% of assessed patients (60% total population). Cumulative incidence of local progression at 1 year and 2 years for all patients was 7% (95% confidence interval [CI] 2%-17%) and 17% (95% CI 8%-29%), respectively. Overall survival at 1 year was 63% (95% CI 48%-74%). Conclusion Hypofractionated radiation therapy delivered weekly with a plan of the day approach offers good local control with acceptable toxicity in a patient population not suitable for radical bladder treatment.Copyright © 2017 The Author(s)",Excluded
1308,"Low-dose radiation exposure and protection against atherosclerosis in ApoE(-/-) mice: the influence of P53 heterozygosity. We recently described the effects of low-dose gamma-radiation exposures on atherosclerosis in genetically susceptible (ApoE(-/-)) mice with normal p53 function. Doses as low as 25 mGy, given at either early or late stage disease, generally protected against atherosclerosis in a manner distinctly nonlinear with dose. We now report the influence of low doses (25-500 mGy) on atherosclerosis in ApoE(-/-) mice with reduced p53 function (Trp53(+/-)). Single exposures were given at either low or high dose rate (1 or 150 mGy/min) to female C57BL/6J ApoE(-/-) Trp53(+/-) mice. Mice were exposed at either early stage disease (2 months of age) and examined 3 or 6 months later, or at late stage disease (7 months of age) and examined 2 or 4 months later. In unirradiated mice, reduced p53 functionality elevated serum cholesterol and accelerated both aortic root lesion growth and severity in young mice. Radiation exposure to doses as low as 25 mGy at early stage disease, at either the high or the low dose rate, inhibited lesion growth, decreased lesion frequency and slowed the progression of lesion severity in the aortic root. In contrast, exposure at late stage disease produced generally detrimental effects. Both low-and high-dose-rate exposures accelerated lesion growth and high dose rate exposures also increased serum cholesterol levels. These results show that at early stage disease, reduced p53 function does not influence the protective effects against atherosclerosis of low doses given at low dose rate. In contrast, when exposed to the same doses at late stage disease, reduced p53 function produced detrimental effects, rather than the protective effects seen in Trp53 normal mice. As in the Trp53 normal mice, all effects were highly nonlinear with dose. These results indicate that variations in p53 functionality can dramatically alter the outcome of a low-dose exposure, and that the assumption of a linear response with dose for human populations is probably unwarranted.",Excluded
1165,"Quality of life and toxicity after SBRT for organ-confined prostate cancer, a 7-year study. Objectives: Stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) yields excellent disease control for low- and intermediate-risk prostate cancer by delivering high doses of radiation in a small number of fractions. Our report presents a 7-year update on treatment toxicity and quality of life (QOL) from 515 patients treated with prostate SBRT. Method(s): From 2006 to 2009, 515 patients with clinically localized, low-, intermediate-, and high-risk prostate cancer were treated with SBRT using Cyberknife technology. Treatment consisted of 35-36.25 Gy in 5 fractions. Seventy-two patients received hormone therapy. Toxicity was assessed at each follow-up visit using the expanded prostate cancer index composite (EPIC) questionnaire and the radiation therapy oncology group urinary and rectal toxicity scale. Result(s): Median follow-up was 72 months. The actuarial 7-year freedom from biochemical failure was 95.8, 89.3, and 68.5% for low-, intermediate-, and high-risk groups, respectively (p < 0.001). No patients experienced acute Grade 3 or 4 acute complications. Fewer than 5% of patients had any acute Grade 2 urinary or rectal toxicity. Late toxicity was low, with Grade 2 rectal and urinary toxicity of 4 and 9.1%, respectively, and Grade 3 urinary toxicity of 1.7%. Mean EPIC urinary and bowel QOL declined at 1 month post-treatment, returned to baseline by 2 years and remained stable thereafter. EPIC sexual QOL declined by 23% at 6-12 months and remained stable afterwards. Of patients potent at baseline evaluation, 67% remained potent at last follow-up. Conclusion(s): This study suggests that SBRT, when administered to doses of 35-36.25 Gy, is efficacious and safe. With long-term follow-up in our large patient cohort, we continue to find low rates of late toxicity and excellent rates of biochemical control.Copyright © 2014 Katz and Kang.",Excluded
3521,"The radiologic technologists' health study in South Korea: study design and baseline results. PURPOSE: To describe the study design, methods, and baseline results of a prospective cohort of radiologic technologists which we have initiated in South Korea., METHODS: The cohort participants were enrolled through a self-administered questionnaire survey administered from April 2012 to May 2013. Survey data were linked with radiation dosimetry, a cancer registry, and health insurance data by personal identification numbers. A nationwide representative survey was also conducted using a stratified random sampling design with face-to-face interviews., RESULTS: A total of 12,387 radiologic technologists were enrolled, which accounted for approximately 63% of all diagnostic radiologic technologists working in South Korea. For nationwide survey, 585 workers were interviewed using the detailed questionnaire, and buccal cells were also collected by scraping the inside of the cheek. The majority of study subjects were under 50-year-old and male workers. The average annual effective dose of radiation declined both men (from 2.75 to 1.43 mSv) and women (from 1.34 to 0.95 mSv) over the period of 1996-2011. A total of 99 cancers (66 cancers in men and 33 in women) were reported from 1992 to 2010. The standardized incidence ratio of all cancer combined was significantly lower in men (SIR = 0.75, 95% CI 0.58-0.96) than general population, but the ratios for thyroid cancer were significantly higher than expected among both men and women., CONCLUSIONS: This cohort provides comprehensive information on work activities and health status of diagnostic radiologic technologists. In addition, the nationwide representative sample provides unique opportunities compared with previous radiologic technologist studies.",Excluded
1465,"Integrating Salvage Hypofractionated Radiosurgery with Low-Dose Adjuvant VEGF for Locally Recurrent Brain Metastasis with High-Dose Irradiation Previously. Purpose/Objective(s): Selection of the appropriate treatment for recurrent brain metastasis remains uncertain. Recent studies have demonstrated a significant response rate and acceptable toxicity with the use of fractionated stereotactic radiosurgery (FSRS) in locally recurrent glioblastoma and large brain metastasis patients due to high ""therapeutic ratio"" (ratio of tumor cell killing to normal tissue toxicity).However, radiation necrosis (RN) is a severe complication associated with salvage re-irradiation. RN may be treated with bevacizumab, which blocks the effects of vascular endothelial growth factor in leakage-prone capillaries. The purpose of this research was to evaluate the efficacy and toxicity of FSRS combined with the early use of low-dose bevacizumab as a new salvage treatment scheme for locally recurrent brain metastases with high dose irradiation. Materials/Methods: Patients with locally recurrent intracranial metastasis previously treated with SRS or WBRT with SRS were enrolled in this prospective study. The salvage FSRS dose ranged from 9.5to 29 Gy in two to five sessions with 62-75% isodoseline by robotic radiosurgery according to the brain tumor volume, site, and previous irradiation dose. Bevacizumab was prescribed to all patients within 24 hours after completion of the treatment for four cycles (5 mg/kg, 3-week intervals).Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), Karnofsky Performance Scale (KPS), adverse events, and associated clinical outcomes were recorded. The primary objective of this study was to identify the overall survival after salvage treatment. Secondary objectives included clinical response (KPS), imaging response (MRI), and treatment-related adverse events. Result(s): From December 2009 to October 2016, a total of 24 patients were enrolled. Of these patients, 9 received WBRT followed by SRS, and 15 underwent SRS. The median 1-year overall survival (OS) after salvage SRS was 87.5%. Twenty-three (96%) patients had a positive imaging response within a range of 6 to 22 cm3 (median 14 cm3, p= 0.032, paired t-test). Significant clinical improvement was achieved (p<0.05, best KPS, paired t-test). Grade 1/2 fatigue was observed in 8 (33%) patients. Other grade 1 or 2 toxicities included headache, hypertension, and nausea. Grade 3 fatigue and headache occurred in 1 patient. No grade 4 toxicity was observed. Conclusion(s): Salvage FSRS with early use of low dose adjuvant bevacizumab treatment showed favorable clinical and radiologic control with manageable toxicity for locally recurrent brain metastasis patients who underwent high dose irradiation previously. The diagnosis of RN and LR after salvage FSRS merit further study.Copyright © 2019",Excluded
1209,"Efficacy of gamma knife radiosurgery for small-volume recurrent malignant gliomas after initial radical resection. Objective: To review the authors' experience with Gamma Knife radiosurgery (GKR) for small recurrent high-grade gliomas (HGGs) following prior radical resection, external-beam radiation therapy (EBRT), and chemotherapy with temozolomide (TMZ). Method(s): The authors retrospectively analyzed 26 consecutive adults (9 women and 17 men; median age 60.4 years; Karnofsky Performance Status [KPS] >=70) who underwent GKR for recurrent HGGs from 2004-2009. Median lesion volume was 1.22 cc, and median treatment dose was 15 Gy. Pathology included glioblastoma multiforme (GBM; n = 16), anaplastic astrocytoma (AA; n = 5), and anaplastic mixed oligoastrocytoma (AMOA; n = 5). Two patients lost to follow-up were excluded from radiographic outcome analyses. Result(s): Median overall survival (OS) for the entire cohort from the time of GKR was 13.5 months. Values for 12-month actuarial survival from time of GKR for GBM, AMOA, and AA were 37%, 20% and 80%. Local failure occurred in 9 patients (37.5%) at a median time of 5.8 months, and 18 patients (75%) experienced distant progression at a median of 4.8 months. Complications included radiation necrosis in two patients and transient worsening of hemiparesis in one patient. Multivariate hazard ratio (HR) analysis showed KPS 90 or greater, smaller tumor volumes, and increased time to recurrence after resection to be associated with longer OS following GKR. Conclusion(s): GKR provided good local tumor control in this group of clinically stable and predominantly high-functioning patients with small recurrent HGGs after radical resection. Meaningful survival times after GKR were seen. GKR can be considered for selected patients with recurrent HGGs. © 2011 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.",Excluded

Background: Thyroid cancer patients treated with radioiodine are potential source of radiation exposure for other individuals. Thus, we evaluated the radiation dose received by family members of thyroid cancer patients treated with 131I after hospital discharge. Material(s) and Method(s): Seventy-six family members of 56 thyroid cancer patients were included in the study. Thyroid cancer patients were given 3.7GBq of 131I and remained in a radiation protection ward for 3 days. Radiation protection recommendations were given to patients and relatives. Life conditions were recorded and radiation doses were monitored using a personal dosimeter. Results and Discussion: At discharge, the mean residual activity was 188MBq. The mean radiation dose delivered to relatives during the 7 days after discharge was low (51.5muSv) and was similar with either recombinant human thyrotropin (rhTSH) (59muSv) or withdrawal (50muSv) (p=0.37). Conclusion(s): With our current practice, radiation doses to relatives are low and well below international recommendations. © 2012, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.",Excluded

Aim: To explore the feasibility and safety of endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography and laparoscopic cholecystectomy (LC) performed during the same session. Method(s): Between July 2010 and May 2013, 156 patients with gallstones and common bile duct (CBD) stones were enrolled in this retrospective study. According to the sequence of endoscopic procedures and LC, patients were classified into two groups: in group 1, patients underwent endoscopic stone extraction and LC during the same session, and in group 2, patients underwent LC at least 3 d after endoscopic stone extraction. Outcomes of the endoscopic procedures and LC were compared between the two groups, respectively. Result(s): There were 91 patients in group 1 and 65 patients in group 2. The characteristics of the two groups were similar. The mean duration of the endoscopic procedures was 34.9 min in group 1 and 35.3 min in group 2. There were no significant differences in the success rate of the endoscopic procedures (97.8% for group 1 vs 98.5% for group 2), the total rate of endoscopic complications (4.40% for group 1 vs 4.62% for group 2) and CBD stone clearance rate (96.7% for group 1 vs 96.9% for group 2). Duration of LC was 53.6 min in group 1 and 52.8 min in group 2. There were no significant differences in the overall LC-related morbidity and postoperative hospital stay.

239,"Comparative analysis of SmartArc-based dual arc volumetric-modulated arc radiotherapy (VMAT) versus intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) for nasopharyngeal carcinoma. The purpose of this study was to evaluate and quantify the planning performance of SmartArc-based volumetric-modulated arc radiotherapy (VMAT) versus fixed-beam intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) for nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) using a sequential mode treatment plan. The plan quality and performance of dual arc-VMAT (DA-VMAT) using the Pinnacle3 Smart-Arc system (clinical version 9.0; Philips, Fitchburg, WI, USA) were evaluated and compared with those of seven-field (7F)-IMRT in 18 consecutive NPC patients. Analysis parameters included the conformity index (CI) and homogeneity index (HI) for the planning target volume (PTV), maximum and mean dose, normal tissue complication probability (NTCP) for the specified organs at risk (OARs), and comprehensive quality index (CQI) for an overall evaluation in the 11 OARs. Treatment delivery time, monitor units per fraction (MU/fr), and Gamma(3 mm, 3%) evaluations were also analyzed. DA-VMAT achieved similar target coverage and slightly better homogeneity than conventional 7F-IMRT with a similar CI and HI. NTCP values were only significantly lower in the left parotid gland (for xerostomia) for DA-VMAT plans. The mean value of CQI at 0.98 +/- 0.02 indicated a 2% benefit in sparing OARs by DA-VMAT. The MU/fr used and average delivery times appeared to show improved efficiencies in DA-VMAT. Each technique demonstrated high accuracy in dose delivery in terms of a high-quality assurance (QA) passing rate (> 98%) of the Gamma(3 mm, 3%) criterion. The major difference between DA-VMAT and 7F-IMRT using a sequential mode for treating NPC cases appears to be improved efficiency, resulting in a faster delivery time and the use of fewer MU/fr.",Excluded
2428,"Cutaneous T-cell lymphoma: Trends in radiation doses and patterns of care 2004-2015. Background and Aim: Radiotherapy is an effective treatment for cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (CTCL). Since 2009, studies have advocated for low-dose radiotherapy (<30 Gy) given it results in similar response rates and less toxicity compared to higher doses (>=30 Gy). We aimed to see if low-dose radiotherapy has been adopted on a national scale in the USA. Material(s) and Method(s): A total of 11,292 adult patients with CTCL were identified in the National Cancer Database. Logistic regression models were created to evaluate predictors for use of low-dose radiotherapy. Result(s): A minority of patients received low-dose radiotherapy (22.4%). The annual percentage of patients receiving low-dose radiotherapy increased from 17.2% in 2009 to 38.4% in 2015. High-volume facilities were associated with use of low-dose radiotherapy (5th quintile vs. bottom two quintiles, odds ratio(OR)=1.76, 95% confidence interval(CI)=1.22-2.54, p=0.003). Conclusion(s): Although the radiotherapy dose administered is decreasing, most patients with CTCL are still receiving doses that may be higher than needed to palliate their disease effectively.Copyright © 2019 International Institute of Anticancer Research.

Purpose: The study aimed to compare two successive series of procedure using first pieces of natural madreporic coral, then coralline hydroxyapatite in traumatology. The goal of this work was to evaluate long term radiological features of absorption and influencing factors. Material: Within six years, 65 pieces were used; only impaction articular fracture on the lateral tibial plateau (31) and calcaneum fractures (23) were included 21 cases completed inclusion criteria. As there were 3 secondary infections, 18 had therefore, an aseptic evolution and were included in this series. Method(s): Absorption was evaluated in five degrees according to the volume of the remaining piece on X-rays. We also took into consideration the position of the pieces and the amount of surfaces in contact with cancellous bone. Result(s): Among the 18 pieces followed up for more than 19 months (average 40), there were 4 sequestrations (1 tibia, 3 calcaneum), all were natural madreporic coral, the others presented osteointegration. Only natural madreporic coral pieces were absorbed, but never completely and the absorption was slow (3 to 7 years) and never complete. A radiolucent line was present in 7 out of 10 pieces of madreporic coral and none around coralline hydroxyapatite. Three developed favorably. Four were sequestered. Number of surfaces in contact with cancellous bone was correlated with osteointegration. Discussion(s): The calcium carbonate which makes up the natural madreporic coral pieces is the Site of destruction by osteoclasts. The radiolucent line is the specific witness of this biochemical activity. The radiolucent line preceeds sequestrations. No substitute of coralline hydroxyapatite has presented the same sign of peripheral absorption or sequestration. Coralline hydroxyapatite could be the correct coralline material to fill cancellous defect after elevation of an articular depression. In every case, the piece of coral must be fitted in contact with the cancellous bone in the depth of the bone. Conditions of osteoconduction of madreporic coral must be reconsidered. The degree and speed of peripheral absorption must be controlled before weight bearing is allowed.",Excluded

Introduction: Recently in our country for curing brain tumors stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) is increasingly used, which combines a sufficient deleterious effect on the target with the maximum protection of the surrounding brain structures. We present our experience in the treatment on robotic system <>, UK. Material(s) and Method(s): Since 2010 this method therapy is applied for treating patients with brain tumors in Khabarovsk Clinical Oncology Centre. During the period of May 2010 - December 2012, 43 patients were treated using SRT. 30 patients with meningioma; 4 - with recurrent astrocytoma; 3 - with metastasis; 3 - with hemispheric cavernous malformation; 2 case of intracanalicular vestibular schwannoma; 1 patient with adenoma. Patients' age from 23 to 71 years old (mean, 52 Y). 10 men and 33 women. Formation of conformal dose distribution was obtained by multileaf (40-pair) collimator with a 0.25 mm accuracy of positioning. Frame fixation was standard. Dose distribution was calculated via XiO system. Patient positioning inaccuracy was measured by X-ray Volume Imaging (XVIm). The correction of patient's position was preformed automatically with HexaPod system, resulting in 0.1 mm accuracy by linear coordinates and 0.1degree by angular coordinates. Result(s): In the 6-months of postradiation period the stabilization of tumor and regression of symptoms was found in all patients. At the 12 months follow-up period tumor shrinking was found in 3 patients, in other cases the stabilization of tumor was observed. There were no severe adverse events. Conclusion(s): Our moderate experience of SRT of patients with brain tumors shows an effectiveness of the method. Moreover, in cases of tumor localization in eloquent areas and in patients with high operative risk, SRT implementation presents as the only accessible type of treatment.

There is no standard approach for salvage treatment. Here we present toxicity and treatment results for recurrent NFC patients who underwent fractionated stereotactic radiotherapy (FSRT) as second line radiotherapy (RT)., MATERIALS AND METHODS: Between April 2009 and July 2012, 24 patients, with a male to female ratio of 3:1, were treated with CykerKnife R FSRT for recurrent NFC in our institution. Seven out of 24 patients had metastatic recurrent disease. Median age was 53 years (range, 20-70 years). Initial RT dose was 70Gy. The time period between initial RT and FSRT was a median of 33.2 months. The median prescription dose for FSRT was 30Gy (range, 24-30 Gy) in a median of 5 fractions (range, 4-6)., RESULTS: The median follow-up for all patients was 19.5 months (IQR: 12.2. -29.2 months). The locoregional control; progression free survival and overall survival (OS) rates for 1-, 2- and 3-year were 64%, 38%, 21%; 60%, 30%, 17% and 83%, 43%, 31%, respectively.

OBJECTIVES: This study sought to compare and contrast use and radiation exposure using radial versus femoral access during cardiac catheterization of patients who had previously undergone coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery., BACKGROUND: Limited information is available on the relative merits of radial compared with femoral access for cardiac catheterization in patients who had previously undergone CABG surgery., METHODS: Consecutive patients (N = 128) having previously undergone CABG surgery and referred for cardiac catheterization were randomized to radial or femoral access. The primary study endpoint was contrast volume. Secondary endpoints included fluoroscopy time, procedure time, patient and operator radiation exposure, vascular complications, and major adverse cardiac events. Analyses were by intention-to-treat., RESULTS: Compared with femoral access, diagnostic coronary angiography via radial access was associated with a higher mean contrast volume (142 +/- 39 ml vs. 171 +/- 72 ml, p < 0.01), longer procedure time (21.9 +/- 6.8 min vs. 34.2 +/- 14.7 min, p < 0.01), greater patient air kerma (kinetic energy released per unit mass) radiation exposure (1.08 +/- 0.54 Gy vs. 1.29 +/- 0.67 Gy, p = 0.06), and higher operator radiation dose (first operator: 1.3 +/- 1.0 mrem vs. 2.6 +/- 1.7 mrem, p < 0.01; second operator 0.8 +/- 1.1 mrem vs. 1.8 +/- 2.1 mrem, p = 0.01). Fewer patients underwent ad hoc percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) in the radial group (37.5% vs. 46.9%, p = 0.28) and radial PCI procedures were less complex. The incidences of the primary and secondary endpoints was similar with femoral and radial access among PCI patients. Access crossover was higher in the radial group (17.2% vs. 0.0%, p < 0.01) and vascular access site complications were similar in both groups (3.1%)., CONCLUSIONS: In patients who had previously undergone CABG surgery, transradial diagnostic coronary angiography was associated with greater contrast use, longer procedure time, and greater access crossover and operator radiation exposure compared with transfemoral angiography.

Background: Definitive radiotherapy and vismodegib, an oral inhibitor of the hedgehog pathway, are both established treatment options for locally advanced basal cell carcinomas (BCC). Both have shown good results in local tumor control; however, the effects concerning advanced tumors are often not of a lasting nature and to date no systematic data about the combination of the two modalities are available. Patients and Methods: We retrospectively analyzed four patients who received vismodegib and radiotherapy in combination. Radiation doses varied between 50.4 Gy and 66.0 Gy. Three patients had recurrent BCC. One patient had locoregional lymph node involvement. Vismodegib was taken once a day (150 mg) during the entire time of irradiation and beyond upon instructions of the attending dermatologist. Result(s): In three cases a persistent complete response was observed, in one case the tumor remained stable for approximately 6 months until further tumor progression was documented. The combined therapy was well tolerated in all cases. No exceptional side effects pointing at a drug-radiation interaction were observed.

1036,"Phase II study of preoperative helical tomotherapy with a simultaneous integrated boost for rectal cancer. PURPOSE: The addition of concomitant chemotherapy to preoperative radiotherapy is considered the standard of care for patients with cT3-4 rectal cancer. The combined treatment modality increases the complete response rate and local control (LC), but has no impact on survival or the incidence of distant metastases. In addition, it is associated with considerable toxicity. As an alternative strategy, we explored prospectively, preoperative helical tomotherapy with a simultaneous integrated boost (SIB)., METHODS AND MATERIALS: A total of 108 patients were treated with intensity-modulated and image-guided radiotherapy using the Tomotherapy Hi-Art II system. A dose of 46 Gy, in daily fractions of 2 Gy, was delivered to the mesorectum and draining lymph nodes, without concomitant chemotherapy. Patients with an anticipated circumferential resection margin (CRM) of less than 2 mm, based on magnetic resonance imaging, received a SIB to the tumor up to a total dose of 55.2 Gy. Acute and late side effects were scored using the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events version 3.0., RESULTS: A total of 102 patients presented with cT3-4 tumors; 57 patients entered the boost group and 51 the no-boost group. One patient in the no-boost group developed a radio-hypersensitivity reaction, resulting in a complete tumor remission, a Grade 3 acute and Grade 5 late enteritis. No other Grade >=3 acute toxicities occurred. With a median follow-up of 32 months, Grade >=3 late gastrointestinal and urinary toxicity were observed in 6% and 4% of the patients, respectively. The actuarial 2-year LC, progression-free survival and overall survival were 98%, 79%, and 93%., CONCLUSIONS: Preoperative helical tomotherapy displays a favorable acute toxicity profile in patients with cT3-4 rectal cancer. A SIB can be safely administered in patients with a narrow CRM and resulted in a promising LC. Copyright © 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.",Excluded
2329,"When should the doctor order a spine X-ray? Identifying vertebral fractures for osteoporosis care: results from the European Prospective Osteoporosis Study (EPOS). UNLABELLED: Vertebral fractures are common but usually remain unrecognized in primary care. Data from 2908 women and 2653 men in the EPOS study were used to derive algorithms to indicate the need for a spine X-ray to identify a fracture using easily elicited determinants. At a sensitivity of 50% for identifying cases, the specificity was increased from 50% to 78% in women and from 50% to 72% in men compared with a random allocation of X-rays. Use of X-rays can be optimized by selecting patients at high risk using a short screening procedure., INTRODUCTION: Previous osteoporotic fracture is an independent risk factor for further fractures and an indication for treatment. Vertebral fractures are the most common osteoporotic fractures before age 75, accounting for 48% of all fractures in men and 39% in women over 50. They usually remain unrecognized, so many patients requiring treatment are denied it, doubling their risk of a further fracture. Our objective was to develop an efficient algorithm indicating the need for an X-ray., MATERIALS AND METHODS: Data from 2908 women and 2653 men >or=50 years of age in the European Prospective Osteoporosis Study (EPOS) were analyzed. Lateral thoracic and lumbar spine radiographs were taken at baseline and at an average of 3.8 years later. Prevalent fractures were qualitatively diagnosed by an experienced radiologist. Fracture risk was modeled as a function of age, statural height loss since age 25, gender, and fracture history including limb fractures in the last 3 years using negative binomial regression. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were used to summarize a model's predictive ability, and a prediction algorithm was devised to identify those most likely to have a fracture., RESULTS: In a multivariate model for women, the risk of prevalent vertebral fracture significantly increased with age (RR, 1.67 [95% CI, 1.46, 1.93] per decade), statural height loss (1.06, [1.03, 1.10] per centimeter decrease), self-reported history of spine fracture (7.52 [5.52, 10.23]), and history of other major fracture (1.83 [1.46, 2.28]). Higher body weight reduced risk (0.86 [0.79, 0.95] per 10-kg increase). In men, the respective RR estimates were as follows: age (1.32 [1.18, 1.49]); height loss (1.06 [1.04, 1.09]); self-reported spine fracture (5.05 [3.69, 6.90]); other major fracture (1.42 [1.12, 1.81]); and weight (0.86 [0.79, 0.94]). Using algorithms based on these easily elicited determinants, specificity was increased from 50% to 78% in women and from 50% to 72% in men at a sensitivity of 50% compared with a random allocation of X-rays. At a sensitivity of 75%, the specificity was 50% in women and 40% in men. Inclusion of hip BMD (femoral neck or trochanter), measured in 1360 women and 1046 men, significantly improved the area under the ROC curves by 4% in women (p < 0.002) but not in men (p > 0.350). Spine BMD, measured in 982 women and 847 men, produced a significant 5% AUC improvement in women (p = 0.007) but not in men (p = 0.554)., CONCLUSION: A woman 65 years of age with one vertebral fracture has a one in four chance of another fracture over 5 years, which can be reduced to one in eight by treatment. Positive treatment decisions are often contingent on identifying a vertebral fracture. Selective use of lateral vertebral X-rays can be optimized using a 2-minute screening procedure administered by a nurse.",Excluded
2512,"Dynamic CT for Parathyroid Adenoma Detection: How Does Radiation Dose Compare With Nuclear Medicine?. OBJECTIVE: Dynamic CT is increasingly used for preoperative localization of parathyroid adenomas, but concerns remain about the radiation effective dose of CT compared with that of 99mTc-sestamibi scintigraphy. The purpose of this study was to compare the radiation dose delivered by three-phase dynamic CT with that delivered by 99mTc-sestamibi SPECT/CT performed in accordance with our current protocols and to assess the possible reduction in effective dose achieved by decreasing the scan length (i.e., z-axis) of two phases of the dynamic CT protocol., MATERIALS AND METHODS: The effective dose of a 99mTc-sestamibi nuclear medicine parathyroid study performed with and without coregistration CT was calculated and compared with the effective dose of our current three-phase dynamic CT protocol as well as a proposed protocol involving CT with reduced scan length., RESULTS: The median effective dose for a 99mTc-sestamibi nuclear medicine study was 5.6 mSv. This increased to 12.4 mSv with the addition of coregistration CT, which is higher than the median effective dose of 9.3 mSv associated with the dynamic CT protocol. Reducing the scan length of two phases in the dynamic CT protocol could reduce the median effective dose to 6.1 mSv, which would be similar to that of the dose from the 99mTc-sestamibi study alone., CONCLUSION: Dynamic CT used for the detection of parathyroid adenoma can deliver a lower radiation dose than 99mTc-sestamibi SPECT/CT. It may be possible to reduce the dose further by decreasing the scan length of two of the phases, although whether this has an impact on accuracy of the localization needs further investigation.",Excluded
1989,"A prospective assessment of radiotherapy (RT)- Induced early functional renal changes by means of 23Na-Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI). Purpose: Radiation-induced renal damage is an important side effect for patients with long-term survival after abdominal RT. Time course of post-RT functional and morphological renal changes is unknown. MRI with 23Na imaging is a novel technique which provides functional kidney assessment. In a previous analysis, for long-term survivors of gastric cancer, late radiation induced changes in the kidney regions exposed to high doses but no alterations in regions exposed to intermediate/low doses were observed. Morphological and functional assessment in the acute post-RT phase in comparison to baseline values are missing. The purpose of this prospective study was to investigate kidney alterations and to correlate them to focal renal radiation doses before and early after abdominal RT. Patients/Methods: 3 pats without any known pre-RT kidney disease who were to undergo RT for abdominal sarcoma and B-NHL, respectively, were examined on a 3.0T scanner before and 2-6 weeks post-RT. In addition to T1- and T2w morphological sequences, 23Na images were obtained using a dedicated 23Na-tuned coil. The planning CT and the associated local radiation isodoses were deformably matched to the morphological MRI sequences with the software ""Velocity"" (Varian). Kidney regions exposed to radiation doses 5Gy, 20 Gy and 40Gy were identified and mean 23Na signal gradient along the cortico-medullary gradient and gradient slope were measured in these regions separately. Result(s): Mean relative 23Na signal of the cortico-medullary gradient and gradient slope matched with values of healthy volunteers in the pre-RT examination. All results are summarised in Table 1. In the first post-RT MRI, morphological sequences (T1 and T2w) did not show any changes. In kidney regions with doses below 20Gy, no changes in the 23Na-gradient slope were observed. For regions with doses of 40Gy and beyond, a functional result was observed that was different from the low dose regions: The slope of the 23Na cortico-medullary gradient in the high-dose regions was markedly reduced in the post-RT MRI when compared to the pre-RT MRI. (Table Presented) Average slope (in arbitrary units/pixel along the cortico-medullary axis) pre and post RT for different dose regions. A marked decrease in average slope is found for the 40Gy regions, whereas the slope of the cortico-medullary 23Na gradient remains high in areas receiving 20Gy or less. Conclusion(s): 2-6 weeks post RT, marked functional effects were observed in high-dose areas while no alteration in kidney function was observed in low dose areas (20Gy), indicating the value of functional MR imaging in the early assessment and characterisation of the chronological course of radiogenic nephrotoxicity.",Excluded

Rapid progress in the field of Cardiac CT is fostered by the advances in CT scanner technology as well as multiple clinical trials demonstrating its role in coronary artery disease and other indications like congenital heart disease, pulmonary vein assessment and pre transcatheter aortic valve replacement. The cardiovascular imager today is responsible for delivering diagnostic image quality while striking a balance with optimized radiation dose. Radiation dose is the result of multiple scanner and patient related factors. Achieving a justifiable radiation dose according to the ALARA principle requires an adept understanding of the factors affecting radiation dose.

3604,"Delayed radiation necrosis of brain evaluated positron emission tomography. In four patients highly suspected of having delayed radiation necrosis of the brain, regional cerebral blood flow and metabolism were studied by using positron emission tomography (PET) with the 15O-labelled gases, 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (18FDG). All four patients showed marked decreases in glucose and oxygen consumption in the lesion with that suspected pathology in comparison with those in normal brain parenchyma. Two of them were histologically proved to have radiation injuries (one was radiation necrosis and another was early delayed reactions). But one patient was histologically proved to have a recurrent tumor. Although metabolic study with PET using 18FDG is generally an excellent procedure for differentiation between radiation injuries and recurrent brain tumor, these results imply that in some cases the differential diagnosis is difficult even with 18FDG. The present study demonstrated considerably more pronounced reduction in the metabolism than the decrease of the blood flow in the lesion with radiation necrosis. This result would indicate that the primary effect causing the radiation necrosis is a direct effect of irradiation on neural tissue rather than the capillary damage.",Excluded

3303,"A multicenter study comparing the outcome of catheter ablation of atrial fibrillation between cryoballoon and radiofrequency ablation in patients with heart failure (CRABL-HF): Study design. Background: Catheter ablation of atrial fibrillation (AF) is increasingly performed worldwide in patients with heart failure (HF). However, it has been recently emphasized that AF ablation in patients with HF is associated with increased risks of procedure-related complications and mortality. There are little data about the differences in the efficacy and safety between cryoballoon (CB) and radiofrequency (RF) ablation of AF in patients with HF. Method(s): The CRABL-HF study is designed as a prospective, multicenter, open-label, controlled, and randomized clinical trial comparing the efficacy and safety of AF ablation between CB and RF ablation in patients with HF (LVEF <=40%) (UMIN Clinical Trials Registry UMIN000032433). The CRABL-HF study will consist of 110 patients at multicenter in Japan. The patients will be registered and randomly assigned to either the CB ablation or RF ablation group with a 1:1 allocation. The primary endpoint of this study is the occurrence of atrial tachyarrhythmias (ATs) at 1 year with a blanking period of 90 days after ablation. Key secondary endpoints are the success rate of the pulmonary vein isolation, total procedural time, left atrial dwelling time, total fluoroscopy time, radiation exposure, complication rate, composite of all-cause mortality or HF hospitalizations, cardiovascular events, change in left ventricular ejection fraction, and change in quality of life.

3447,"Radiation-free weekend rescued! Continuous accelerated irradiation of 7-days per week is equal to accelerated fractionation with concomitant boost of 7 fractions in 5-days per week: Report on phase 3 clinical trial in head-and-neck cancer patients. Purpose: To report long-term results of randomized trial comparing 2 accelerated fractionations of definitive radiation therapy assessing the need to irradiate during weekend in patients with head and neck squamous cell carcinoma. Methods and Materials: A total of 345 patients with SCC of the oral cavity, larynx, and oro- or hypo-pharynx, stage T2-4N0-1M0, were randomized to receive continuous accelerated irradiation (CAIR: once per day, 7 days per week) or concomitant accelerated boost (CB: once per day, 3 days per week, and twice per day, 2 days per week). Total dose ranged from 66.6-72 Gy, dose per fraction was 1.8 Gy, number of fractions ranged from 37-40 fractions, and overall treatment time ranged from 37-40 days. Result(s): No differences for all trial end-points were noted. At 5 and 10 years, the actuarial rates of local-regional control were 63% and 60% for CAIR vs 65% and 60% for CB, and the corresponding overall survival were 40% and 25% vs 44% and 25%, respectively. Confluent mucositis was the main acute toxicity, with an incidence of 89% in CAIR and 86% in CB patients. The 5-year rate of grade 3-4 late radiation morbidity was 6% for both regimens. Conclusion(s): Results of this trial indicate that the effects of accelerated fractionation can be achieve by delivering twice-per-day irradiation on weekday(s). This trial has also confirmed that an accelerated, 6-weeks schedule is a reasonable option for patients with intermediate-stage head-and-neck squamous cell carcinoma because of the associated high cure rate and minimal severe late toxicity. © 2013 Elsevier Inc.

2636,"The Assessment of the Integrated Antioxidant System of the Body in the Course of Radon Therapy: A Pilot Study. Introduction. The sources of Reactive Oxidative Species (ROS) in the organism are the respiratory processes occurring in cells catalyzed by different enzymes. Operation of ROS is balanced by antioxidants, the compounds; although present in low concentrations, they significantly inhibit the degree of oxidation of particular molecules. The Aim of the Study. The aim of this study was to assess the changes in the integrated antioxidant system under the influence of radon therapy in osteoarthritis patients. Material and Methods. Observation included 35 patients suffering from degenerative joints and disc disease (mean age 56.5 years) undergoing radon water therapy and control group that consisted of 15 osteoarthritis patients (mean age 54.2) without contact with radon water. Before therapy and after 18 days of treatment, serum total antioxidant status (TAS) was assessed with the use of standard colorimetric assay. Results. In the study group, we observed trends to increase TAS concentration, whereas, in the control group, TAS concentration was decreasing. Conclusions. (1) Radon waters treatment influenced the level of TAS of osteoarthritis patients treated with the radon water. (2) The change in TAS concentrations in the study group may be the result of low doses of ionizing radiation, but further studies on larger patient's groups are demanded.

1794,"Dose escalation of gemcitabine concomitant with radiation and cisplatin for nonsmall cell lung cancer: A phase 1-2 study. BACKGROUND: The current study was conducted to evaluate the maximum tolerable dose of weekly gemcitabine administered simultaneously with radiation and cisplatin in patients with locally advanced nonsmall cell lung cancer (NSCLC). METHOD(S): Patients with stage IIIA/B NSCLC received concurrently 63 grays radiation and 20 mg/m2 cisplatin Day 1 to 3 in Weeks 1 and 5, plus weekly gemcitabine at escalating doses (150-700 mg/m2) on Fridays after radiation to avoid radiosensitization. The authors assessed dose-limiting toxicities according to Common Toxicity Criteria. The primary endpoint was maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of gemcitabine. Tumor resectability, survival, and disease-free survival (DFS) were also determined. RESULT(S): Forty-two patients were accrued, of whom 95% received radiation and 66% cisplatin as above. Weekly doses of gemcitabine were escalated to 700 mg/m 2. Grade 3 dysphagia and 1 case of fatal, probably treatment-related pulmonary deterioration established the MTD of gemcitabine at 550 mg/m2 weekly. Twenty-five patients underwent surgery, and histopathological complete regression was documented in 26% of these patients. Overall, median actuarial survival and DFS were 23.8 and 12.4 months, respectively. CONCLUSION(S): Gemcitabine at doses up to 550 mg/m2 weekly can be given simultaneously with radiation and cisplatin to patients with locally advanced NSCLC. Radical resection thereafter is feasible.

3043,"Rapid High-Throughput Diagnostic Triage after a Mass Radiation Exposure Event Using Early Gene Expression Changes. Radiological exposure scenarios involving large numbers of people require a rapid and high-throughput method to identify the unexposed, and those exposed to low- and high-dose radiation. Those with high-dose exposure, e.g., >2 Gy and depending on host characteristics, may develop severe hematological acute radiation syndrome (HARS), requiring hospitalization and treatment. Previously, we identified a set of genes that discriminated these clinically relevant groups. In the current work, we examined the utility of gene expression changes to classify 1,000 split blood samples into HARS severity scores of H0, H1 and H2-4, with the latter indicating likely hospitalization. In several previous radiation dose experiments, we determined that these HARS categories corresponded, respectively, to doses of 0 Gy (unexposed), 0.5 Gy and 5 Gy. The main purpose of this work was to assess the rapidity of blood sample processing using targeted next-generation sequencing (NGS). Peripheral blood samples from two healthy donors were X-ray irradiated in vitro and incubated at 37degreeC for 24 h. A total of 1,000 samples were evaluated by laboratory personnel blinded to the radiation dose. Changes in gene expression of FDXR, DDB2, POU2AF1 and WNT3 were examined with qRT-PCR as positive controls. Targeted NGS (TREX) was used on all samples for the same four genes. Agreement using both methods was almost 78%. Using NGS, all 1,000 samples were processed within 30 h. Classification of the HARS severity categories corresponding to radiation dose had an overall agreement ranging between 90-97%. Depending on the end point, either a combination of all genes or FDXR alone (H0 HARS or unexposed) provided the best classification. Using this optimized automated methodology, we assessed 100x more samples approximately three times faster compared to standard cytogenetic studies. We showed that a small set of genes, rather than a complex constellation of genes, provided robust positive (97%) and negative (97%) predictive values for HARS categories and radiation doses of 0, 0.5 and 5 Gy. The findings of this study support the potential utility of early radiation-induced gene expression changes for high-throughput biodosimetry and rapid identification of irradiated persons in need of hospitalization.",Excluded

PURPOSE: The European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) phase II study No. 22953 demonstrated the feasibility of reducing the overall treatment time of chemoradiation, delivering mitomycin C twice rather than once and fluorouracil during the whole treatment. We tested the feasibility of chemoradiation in anal carcinoma with mitomycin and cisplatin in a phase II study. METHOD(S): Twenty-one patients with locally advanced anal carcinoma (15 women, 6 men) were treated. The first sequence of radiotherapy consisted of 36 Gy over four weeks. After a gap interval of 16 days, a second sequence of radiotherapy was given, delivering 23.4 Gy over 2.5 weeks. Mitomycin C was delivered at 10 mg/m2 day 1 of each sequence and cisplatin was delivered at 25 mg/m2/week of each sequence. RESULT(S): The compliance rates for the first sequence with radiation, mitomycinm, and cispaltin (dose and timing) were 100 percent. The median duration gap was 16 days (14-30 days). The compliance rates for the second sequence with radiation, mitomycin, and cisplatin (dose and timing) were 100, 76.2, and 85.7 percent, respectively. Grade>=2 acute toxicities of 62, 29, 25, and 5 percent were observed for skin, diarrhea, hematologic, and renal toxicities, respectively. Nineteen patients were in complete response (90.5 percent).

1430,"Development and evaluation of solid lipid nanoparticles of n-6-furfuryl adenine for prevention of photoaging. N-6-furfuryl adenine (N6FA) also known as ""kinetin"" is a biologically active natural phytochemical. It belongs to the category of cytokinins, the natural plant growth hormones that promote cell division and play role in cell differentiation. Overall, N6FA aids in increasing the plant's life span. Human cells also contain small quantities of N6FA. Scientists are trying to understand its function in humans. N6FA is being investigated for its properties such as antiplatelet, antioxidant, antiproliferative and anti-aging effects on human cells. The aim of the present investigation was to prepare solid lipid nanoparticle (SLN) based topical formulations of N6FA and to evaluate its efficacy against ultraviolet (UV) radiation induced skin photodamage. SLNs were prepared by hot microemulsion technique and optimized for the type and concentration of lipid and surfactant(s). The optimized SLN formulation was characterized in terms of particle size, drug entrapment efficiency, zeta potential and pH; evaluated for stability, spreadability, ex-vivo skin permeation and photoprotective effects against UV induced skin damage. The cumulative amount of drug permeated through mice skin using SLNs was 3 folds higher than from conventional cream base. The results of biochemical and histopathological investigations of skin treated with N6FA loaded SLNs clearly demonstrated the efficacy of optimized formulation in preventing photodamage (lesions, ulcers and changes in skin integrity) due to chronic UV exposure. The effects were comparable with widely used marketed formulation, Garnier wrinkle lift anti-aging cream. Results suggested that N6FA incorporated into SLNs may provide therapeutic as well as cosmeceutical benefits.Copyright © 2015 American Scientific Publishers All rights reserved.",Excluded
2384,"Role of routine chest radiography after percutaneous dilatational tracheostomy. BACKGROUND: The role of routine chest radiography (CXR) after percutaneous dilatational tracheostomy (PDT) has been questioned., METHODS: We performed a prospective observational study, on a mixed medical/surgical critical care unit in a university teaching hospital. We studied all patients undergoing PDT as part of their critical care management from November 1, 2003 until July 31, 2007. All PDTs were performed under bronchoscopic guidance. After PDT, we reviewed the immediate post-procedural films to assess the utility of routine postoperative CXR. For the purposes of CXR review, we considered a procedure to be either uncomplicated or technically difficult. Clinically relevant CXR findings were new barotrauma (pneumothorax, pneumomediastinum) or a significant change in consolidation from the pre-procedure film., RESULTS: A total of 384 patients underwent PDT during the study period. Of these, 345 had immediate post-procedural CXRs available for review. There were 252 PDTs (73%) documented as uncomplicated. There were 93 (27%) technically difficult procedures, with 107 adverse events recorded. In 82 (24%) procedures, these difficulties were described as minor procedural complications [multiple attempts at needle insertion (> or = 3), minor bleeding or tracheal ring fracture]. Significant complications (mal-placement in the anterior mediastinum and major bleeding) were documented in 12 (3.5%) patients. New abnormalities were noted on 8 (2.3%) immediate post-procedural CXRs. In only one patient was there a new CXR change in an uncomplicated PDT., CONCLUSIONS: Immediate CXR after uncomplicated PDT performed under bronchoscopic guidance rarely reveals unexpected radiological abnormalities. The role of CXR after PDT appears to be restricted to those patients undergoing technically difficult and complicated procedures. A change in practice to this effect will lead to reductions in both medical costs and exposure of staff and patients to ionizing radiation.",Excluded
3260,"Study of 201 non-small cell lung cancer patients given stereotactic ablative radiation therapy shows local control dependence on dose calculation algorithm. PURPOSE: Pencil beam (PB) and collapsed cone convolution (CCC) dose calculation algorithms differ significantly when used in the thorax. However, such differences have seldom been previously directly correlated with outcomes of lung stereotactic ablative body radiation (SABR)., METHODS AND MATERIALS: Data for 201 non-small cell lung cancer patients treated with SABR were analyzed retrospectively. All patients were treated with 50 Gy in 5 fractions of 10 Gy each. The radiation prescription mandated that 95% of the planning target volume (PTV) receive the prescribed dose. One hundred sixteen patients were planned with BrainLab treatment planning software (TPS) with the PB algorithm and treated on a Novalis unit. The other 85 were planned on the Pinnacle TPS with the CCC algorithm and treated on a Varian linac. Treatment planning objectives were numerically identical for both groups. The median follow-up times were 24 and 17 months for the PB and CCC groups, respectively. The primary endpoint was local/marginal control of the irradiated lesion. Gray's competing risk method was used to determine the statistical differences in local/marginal control rates between the PB and CCC groups., RESULTS: Twenty-five patients planned with PB and 4 patients planned with the CCC algorithms to the same nominal doses experienced local recurrence. There was a statistically significant difference in recurrence rates between the PB and CCC groups (hazard ratio 3.4 [95% confidence interval: 1.18-9.83], Gray's test P=.019). The differences (DELTA) between the 2 algorithms for target coverage were as follows: DELTAD99GITV = 7.4 Gy, DELTAD99PTV = 10.4 Gy, DELTAV90GITV = 13.7%, DELTAV90PTV = 37.6%, DELTAD95PTV = 9.8 Gy, and DELTADISO = 3.4 Gy. GITV = gross internal tumor volume., CONCLUSIONS: Local control in patients receiving who were planned to the same nominal dose with PB and CCC algorithms were statistically significantly different. Possible alternative explanations are described in the report, although they are not thought likely to explain the difference. We conclude that the difference is due to relative dosimetric underdosing of tumors with the PB algorithm. Copyright © 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.",Excluded

Aim: To summarize the effects of laparoscopic ethanol injection and radiofrequency ablation (L-EI-RFA), thoracoscopic (T-EI-RFA) and open-surgery assisted EI-RFA (O-EI-RFA) under general anesthesia for the treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Method(s): Time-lag performance of RFA after ethanol injection (Time-lag PEI-RFA) was performed in all cases. The volume of coagulated necrosis and the applied energy for total and per unit volume coagulated necrosis were examined in the groups treated under general (group G) or local anesthesia (group L). Result(s): The results showed that the total applied energy and the applied energy per unit volume of whole and marginal, coagulated necrosis were significantly larger in group G than those in the group L, resulting in a larger volume of coagulated necrosis in the group G. The rate of local tumor recurrence within one year was extremely low in group G. Conclusion(s): These results suggest that EI-RFA, under general anesthesia, may be effective for the treatment of HCC because a larger quantity of ethanol and energy could be applied during treatment under pain-free condition for the patients. © 2008 WJG.

1698,"An examination of radon awareness, risk communication, and radon risk reduction in a Hispanic community. Purpose: Radiation risk communication is a critical component of radiation protection and the public's understanding of radiation risks and benefits. Risk communication becomes even more complicated when considering cultural and language differences. In the US, many diverse communities face risk communication challenges. We obtained radon testing data to evaluate patterns of radon testing in Allentown, the third largest city in Pennsylvania. Radon exposure is the second leading cause of lung cancer after smoking and is associated with over 21,000 lung cancer deaths in the US annually. It is estimated that 1 in every 15 homes in the US has elevated radon levels above the recommended action level set by the US Environmental Protection Agency. Allentown has some of the highest reported levels of indoor radon in the country, yet only a small portion of the population has tested their homes. This is true particularly among self-identified Hispanics, who make up nearly half of the city's population. This study seeks to (1) characterize the difference in testing rates between self-identified Hispanics and non-Hispanics in Allentown, (2) quantify the level of radon awareness and knowledge, (3) identify potential obstacles to radon testing among the Allentown population that self-identifies as Hispanic, and (4) determine whether more effective risk communication is needed. Method(s): Radon test results in Allentown were analyzed to better understand the nature of radon testing. To evaluate radon awareness and knowledge, a cross-sectional study was conducted using a face-to-face survey. This data was informative in assessing testing and mitigation practices, ethnicity, income level, age, education level, homeowner status, zip code and primary language. Result(s): Ethnicity was an independent predictor of radon awareness and knowledge. Statistically significant differences were found between the number of self-identified Hispanics (39%) and non-Hispanics (84%) who indicated that they had ever heard of radon; 13% of Hispanics and 49% of non-Hispanics knew that they lived in an area with typically high radon levels. There was a statistically significant association between self-reported ethnicity and radon testing with non-Hispanics (43%) more likely to test their homes for radon than Hispanics (32%). Conclusion(s): Individual and community understanding of the risks of exposure to radiation sources such as radon is dependent upon communication that informs and spurs appropriate action. This study demonstrates the need for culturally appropriate radon risk communication strategies targeted to a Hispanic population. Successful communication will raise awareness and knowledge that can lead to better public health protection.© 2020, Copyright © 2020 Taylor & Francis Group LLC.",Excluded
2451,"Alternative means of estimating maximum permissible activity of I-131 administered to treat thyroid cancer. Objectives Maximum permissible activity (MPA) of I-131 to be administered to treat thyroid cancer traditionally combines 2 dose components & requires 5 days of repeatedly measuring whole body gamma radiation with an Anger camera & blood processing. The objective of our study was to determine whether the 2 dose components are sufficiently well correlated to enable estimating total dose from blood work alone. Methods Data were examined retrospectively for all pts studied from 2004 - 2015. An uncollimated gamma camera measured anterior & posterior counts (corrected for background & decay & calibrated by I-131 standards) 6 times over 5 days after administration of 37-74 MBq I-131 to estimate dose to blood from gamma emissions (Dgamma). Blood was sampled within 10 min of each camera measurement, well counter counts of which estimated dose to blood from beta emissions (Dbeta). Adding these 2 estimates provided total dose (DT) to blood forming organs, adjusted for body habitus. Predicted total dose (DP) was obtained from Dbeta alone by linear regression. Conventional MPA was computed as 200 rad/DT & predicted MPA as 200 rad/DP. Results There were 62 pts (age = 61+/-12 yrs; 30 female; 32 male), of whom 2 were studied twice & 3 were studied 3 times, for a total of 68 measurements. DT was progressively larger for pts studied multiple times (rank correlation rho = 0.39, p = 0.004). DP was computed as = -0.005+1.473* Dbeta, & correlated strongly with DT (r = 0.98, p < 0.0001; intercept = 0.04+/-0.02, p = 0.09; slope = 0.95+/-0.02, p < 0.0001), with similar means (0.76+/-0.51 versus 0.76+/-0.52 rad/mCi, paired t-test p = 0.96). Predicted & conventional total doses were similar for pts studied once (0.69+/-0.41 versus 0.68+/-0.42 rad/mCi, p = 0.72), twice (1.06+/-0.69 versus 1.11+/-0.64 rad/mCi, p = 0.39), & 3 times (1.25+/-0.59 versus 1.26+/-0.62 rad/mCi, p = 0.87).

Result(s): Twelve patients with well-differentiated gastroenteropancreatic (GEP) NETs took part in the study.68Ga-OPS202 cleared rapidly from the blood, with a mean residence time of 2.4 6 1.1 min/L. The organs with the highest mean dose coefficients were the urinary bladder wall, kidneys, and spleen. The calculated effective dose was 2.4E2 02 6 0.2E202 mSv/MBq, corresponding to 3.6 mSv, for a reference activity of 150 MBq. Based on total numbers of detected malignant lesions, the optimal time window for the scan was between 1 and 2 h. For malignant liver lesions, the time point at which most patients had the highest mean tumor contrast was 1 h.68Ga-OPS202 was well tolerated; adverse events were grade 1 or 2, and there were no signals of concern from laboratory blood or urinalysis tests. Conclusion(s):68Ga-OPS202 showed favorable biodistribution and imaging properties, with optimal tumor contrast between 1 and 2 h after injection. Dosimetry analysis revealed that the dose delivered by68Ga-OPS202 to organs is similar to that delivered by other68Ga-labeled sst analogs. Further evaluation of68Ga-OPS202 for PET/CT imaging of NETs is therefore warranted.Copyright COPYRIGHT © 2018 by the Society of Nuclear Medicine and Molecular Imaging.",Excluded
435,"Investigation of PKC isoform-specific translocation and targeting of the current of the late afterhyperpolarizing potential of myenteric AH neurons. AH neurons in the enteric nervous system play an essential role in initiating intestinal reflexes and factors that control AH neuron excitability therefore influence the state of the digestive system. Prominent afterhyperpolarizations that follow action potentials in these neurons strongly affect their excitability. In the present work, we have investigated the regulation of the afterhyperpolarizing current (I(AHP)) by protein kinase C (PKC). Electrophysiological responses and protein translocation were investigated in AH neurons of freshly dissected preparations of myenteric ganglia from the guinea-pig ileum. The activator of conventional and novel PKCs, phorbol dibutyrate, but not the activator of novel PKCs, ingenol, blocked the I(AHP). Phorbol dibutyrate had no effect on the hyperpolarization-activated current (I(h)) or on the A current (I(A)). Stimulation of synaptic inputs to the neurons also reduced the I(AHP), and had no effect on I(h) or I(A). Phorbol dibutyrate also reduced a background outward current that was present after the I(AHP) current had been blocked by clotrimazole. Both phorbol dibutyrate and ingenol caused translocation of the novel PKC, PKCepsilon, in these neurons. Only phorbol dibutyrate caused translocation of PKCgamma, a conventional PKC. The studies thus indicate that the activation of PKC by phorbol esters and by nerve stimulation affects AH neurons in a similar way, and that PKC activation targets both the I(AHP) and another background K(+) current. The I(AHP) is targeted by a conventional PKC, suggested to be PKCgamma, as this is the only conventional PKC that is prominent in AH neurons.",Excluded
945,"The effect of body mass index on fluoroscopic time and radiation dose during lumbar transforaminal epidural steroid injections. OBJECTIVE: Transforaminal epidural steroid injections (TFESIs) are a commonly used, effective treatment for radicular pain. Accurate delivery of the injected medication helps to ensure maximum therapeutic efficacy and to decrease possible adverse events, and fluoroscopy is the preferred and most common image-guidance modality used to ensure accurate needle placement during lumbar TFESIs. However, fluoroscopic-guided lumbar TFESIs put patients at risk because of radiation exposure. The purpose of this study was to determine the relationship between body mass index (BMI) and fluoroscopy time and radiation dose during lumbar TFESIs., DESIGN: A retrospective study design was used., SETTING: The study was conducted at an academic orthopedic center. All procedures were performed by physicians board-certified in Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation (PM&R) and with subspecialty certification in sports medicine, or by a trainee under close supervision from an attending physician., PARTICIPANTS: Participants were patients who underwent fluoroscopic-guided lumbar TFESIs between February 2013 and March 2015 with a documented height/weight, fluoroscopy time, and radiation dose., INTERVENTIONS: All patients received unilateral or bilateral lumbar TFESIs with fluoroscopic guidance. Fluoroscopy time and dose were recorded., MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The main outcome measures were fluoroscopy time and radiation dose. A Bonferroni correction was implemented for multiple comparisons, defining statistical significance at p<.01., RESULTS: A total of 2,443 injections were performed on 1,548 patients. There were 419 normal, 572 overweight, and 557 obese patients, respectively. There were 1,426 first-time injections and 1,017 repeat injections. Sixty-nine percent (1,681) were unilateral injections, and 26.4% (645) were single level injections. A trainee was involved in 1,361 (55.7%) of the injections performed. The mean fluoroscopy time for all injections was 30.0+/-17.5 seconds, and the mean radiation dose was 2,164+/-1,484 mGy-cm(2). The mean fluoroscopy time was 27.7+/-15.2 seconds for normal weight patients, 30.0+/-21.0 seconds for overweight patients, and 32.2+/-15.1 seconds for obese patients, showing a significant difference between groups (p<.001). The mean radiation doses for each group were 1,376+/-450, 1,911+/-653, and 3,029+/-640 mGy-cm(2), respectively, with a significant increase in radiation dose with increasing BMI (p<.001)., CONCLUSIONS: The findings of this study demonstrate that fluoroscopy radiation dose and fluoroscopy time during lumbar TFESIs are increased in patients with an elevated BMI, and in patients of greater age, but the presence of a trainee had no effect on fluoroscopy time.

2738,"Environmental radioactivity and high incidence rates of stomach and esophagus cancer in the Van Lake Region: A causal relationship?. This study examined the incidence rates of cancer cases (averages for 2006-2010) and relationships with environmental radioactivity levels. Soil and water samples were collected from provincial and district centers of Van city and the outdoor gamma doses were determined using a portable gamma scintillation detector. Gross alpha and beta, (226)Ra, (232)Th, and (40)K activities were measured in both tap water and soil samples. Although high rates of stomach and esophagus cancers have been reported previously in Van the underlying reasons have not hitherto been defined. Incidences of cancers were highest in the Gurpinar (326.0) and Ozalp (377.1) counties (p<0.001). As to the results of the gross alpha and gross beta radioactivity measurements in the drinking water, these two counties also had high beta radionuclide levels: Gurpinar (140 mBq/dm3) and Ozalp (206 mBq/dm3). Even if within the normal range, a relation between the higher rate of the incidence of stomach and esophagus cancers with that of the higher rate of beta radionuclide activity was clear. On Spearman correlation analysis, the relation between higher beta radionuclide levels and cancer incidence was found to be statistically significant (p<0.01). According to the results of the analysis, Van residents receive an average 1.86 mSv/y annual dose from outdoor gamma radiation, ingestion of radionuclides in the drinking water, and indoor 222Rn activity. Moreover, gross alpha and beta activities were found to be extremely high in all of the lakes around the city of Van, Turkey. Further investigations with long-term detailed environmental radiation measurements are needed regarding the relationship between cancer cases and environmental radioactivity in the city of Van.",Excluded
1691,"Neurotrophic keratitis after transscleral diode laser cyclophotocoagulation. OBJECTIVE: To study the relationship between treatment with diode laser transscleral cyclophotocoagulation and development a neurotrophic keratitis due to the damage of the sensitive corneal innervation., METHODS: A study was conducted on 5 eyes of 5 patients who were treated with diode laser transscleral cyclophotocoagulation and soon developed neurotrophic ulcers. Personal characteristics of the patients were collected, as well as refraction and risk factors for corneal hypoesthesia, and the parameters of the laser used in the surgery., RESULTS: It was found that the 5 patients had predisposing factors of corneal hypoesthesia prior to surgery (chronic use of topical beta blockers, surgery with corneal incisions, diabetes mellitus, or corneal dystrophies); however none had developed neurotrophic keratitis until the cyclophotocoagulation was performed. It also showed that 4 of them were highly myopic, and they all were treated with high laser parameters (with an average of 2880 mW for 3s at an average surface of 275degree), triggering neurotrophic ulcers between 10 and 35 days after surgery., CONCLUSION: Neurotrophic keratitis is a rare complication that can occur after diode laser transscleral cyclophotocoagulation, secondary to the damage of the long ciliary nerves. The emergence of this disorder can be triggered by the existence of previous risk factors, including high myopia, thus it is important to respect the recommended treatment parameters to prevent the development of this disorder.

PURPOSE: The aim of this study was to determine whether recurrence of meningiomas could be reduced by combining somatostatin receptor scintigraphy (SRS) of Tc-HYNIC-octreotide SPECT/CT and radio guidance with a hand-held gamma-probe during surgery., MATERIALS AND METHODS: Thirty patients with meningiomas diagnosed by MRI and considered as the study group were treated with Tc-HYNIC-octreotide SPECT/CT preoperatively and pathologically examined postoperatively. Another 60 patients considered as the control group underwent only an MRI preoperatively and a pathological examination postoperatively. For the patients in the study group, meningiomas were removed by a hand-held gamma-probe 4-12 h after SRS; these patients were followed up by MRI examination each year for 5 years to monitor the recurrence rate of the meningiomas. For the control group, routine operations without radio guidance were performed and followed up with MRI examination simultaneously., RESULTS: All patients in the study group, comprising 20 with grade I and 10 with grade II meningiomas, showed high Tc-HYNIC-octreotide accumulation with a sensitivity of 100% for SRS; four patients (13.3%) relapsed after a 5-year follow-up, including one (5%) patient with a grade I and three (30%) patients with a grade II meningioma. However, among the 60 control patients, 30 were of grade I and 30 were of grade II; 18 patients (30%) experienced recurrence, including five (16.7%) grade I patients and 13 (43.3%) grade II patients. There were significant differences in recurrence between the study group and the control group when considering all the patients and those in grade I and grade II (all P values were below 0.001)., CONCLUSION: Tc-HYNIC-octreotide SPECT/CT SRS is a sensitive technique for detecting meningiomas, and radio guidance using a hand-held gamma-probe with Tc-HYNIC-octreotide during surgery can significantly reduce the recurrence of meningiomas.",Excluded

2398,"High thyroid radiation dose associated with 131-I-19-iodocholesterol adrenal scanning. We have examined two patients undergoing 131I-19-iodocholesterol adrenal scans in order to assess thyroidal radiation dose. Thyroid uptakes of 3--5% of the administered 2 mCi dose were found despite prior administration of Lugol's iodine. Analysis of serum samples over a ten day period after iodocholesterol injection indicated that less than 10% of the radioactivity was free iodide. Kinetic results showed a high value for the thyroid/plasma 131I ratio indicating thyroid retention of 131I. This was substantiated by thyroid scintigrams. The thyroid radiation dose was estimated to be 200--250 rad for the two patients. The associated carcinogenic risk is of sufficient magnitude, in our opinion, to warrant regular follow-up of all patients who have undergone 131I-19-iodocholesterol adrenal scanning.",Excluded

1053,"Solar urticaria. Introduction. Solar urticaria (SU) is a rare photodermatosis induced by a broad spectrum of electromagnetic radiation. Theoretically it should not present a diagnostic problem, but in everyday practice it is quite frequently misdiagnosed. Objective. To characterize SU cases diagnosed in the photobiology unit of the Dermatological Department of WUM, with particular analysis of conformity of initial diagnosis with that established in the photobiology unit. Material and methods. Investigation was performed in 87 patients directed to the photobiology unit with diagnosis of solar urticaria (out of 12 041 patients with different forms of light hypersensitivity tested). In all patients in order to determine sensitivity to UVB and UVA phototests were performed. They included evaluation of minimal urticarial dose. As the light source fluorescent bulbs emitting a continuous spectrum of UVB or UVA were used. In 5 patients to evaluate sensitivity to visible light a slide projector was used. In 30 patients additionally photopatch tests were done. Results. Our results confirmed rare occurrence of solar urticaria. Diagnosis of US was confirmed only in 15 out of 87 patients with such initial diagnosis (17.2%); they represented 0.12% of all patients with photodermatoses tested. In this group there were 8 women and 7 men of mean age 26.2 years (M), 25.7 years (W). In the majority (9) of cases the disease lasted one year before testing. The US action spectrum in our patients was UVA + UVB in 9 cases, mainly UVA in 2, mainly UVB in 2, and in two patients urticarial wheals were provoked by UVA, UVB and visible light. We did not notice either delayed onset or prolonged duration of urticaria. Photopatch testing and longer (up to 2 weeks after UV exposure) observation of irradiated sites enabled us to make a proper diagnosis in further 52 patients. In 35 we disclosed polymorphic light eruptions, in 12 contact dermatitis to chromium, in 2 photocontact dermatitis to chlorpromazine and fragrance substances. In 3 patients we diagnosed chronic actinic dermatitis. In 20 cases it was not possible to establish a definite diagnosis. Wrong initial diagnosis was observed mainly in patients hypersensitive to UVA. Conclusions. In patients with oedemato-erythematous lesions after sun exposure lasting longer than 24 h, particularly in the elderly, diagnostic procedures should include additionally to phototesting patch and photopatch tests.",Excluded
933,"Comparative study of DNA damage and repair in head and neck cancer after radiation treatment. We compared DNA damage and the efficacy of its repair after genotoxic treatment with gamma-radiation of lymphocytes and tissue cells isolated from patients with squamous cell carcinoma of head and neck (HNSCC) and healthy donors. Thirty-seven subjects with HNSCC and 35 healthy donors were enrolled in the study. The extent of DNA damage including oxidative lesions and efficiency of the repair were examined by alkaline comet assay. HNSCC cancer cells were more sensitive to genotoxic treatment and displayed impaired DNA repair. In particular, lesions caused by gamma-radiation were repaired less effectively in metastasis of HNSCC than in healthy controls. The differences in radiation sensitivity of cancer and control cells suggested that DNA repair might be critical for HNSCC treatment. We conclude that gamma-radiation might be considered as an effective therapeutic strategy for head and neck cancers, including patients in advanced stage of the disease with clear evidence of metastasis.",Excluded
2888,"Needle placement for piriformis injection using 3-D imaging. Piriformis syndrome is a pain syndrome originating in the buttock and is attributed to 6% - 8% of patients referred for the treatment of back and leg pain. The treatment for piriformis syndrome using fluoroscopy, computed tomography (CT), electromyography (EMG), and ultrasound (US) has become standard practice. The treatment of Piriformis Syndrome has evolved to include fluoroscopy and EMG with CT guidance. We present a case study of 5 successful piriformis injections using 3-D computer-assisted electromagnet needle tracking coupled with ultrasound. A 6-degree of freedom electromagnetic position tracker was attached to the ultrasound probe that allowed the system to detect the position and orientation of the probe in the magnetic field. The tracked ultrasound probe was used to find the posterior superior iliac spine. Subsequently, 3 points were captured to register the ultrasound image with the CT or magnetic resonance image scan. Moreover, after the registration was obtained, the navigation system visualized the tracked needle relative to the CT scan in real-time using 2 orthogonal multi-planar reconstructions centered at the tracked needle tip. Conversely, a recent study revealed that fluoroscopically guided injections had 30% accuracy compared to ultrasound guided injections, which tripled the accuracy percentage. This novel technique exhibited an accurate needle guidance injection precision of 98% while advancing to the piriformis muscle and avoiding the sciatic nerve. The mean (+/- SD) procedure time was 19.08 (+/- 4.9) minutes. This technique allows for electromagnetic instrument tip tracking with realtime 3-D guidance to the selected target. As with any new technique, a learning curve is expected; however, this technique could offer an alternative, minimizing radiation exposure.",Excluded

Purpose: This prospective study seeks to extract semiquantitative positron emission tomography (PET) features from 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose PET scans performed before and during neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy for esophageal cancer and to compare their accuracy in predicting histopathologic response. Methods and Materials: From 2012 to 2016, 26 patients with esophageal cancer underwent pretreatment and intratreatment PET scans during chemoradiotherapy followed by surgery. Median patient age was 63 years (interquartile range, 58-68 years); 26 patients had esophageal adenocarcinoma, and 3 had esophageal squamous cell carcinoma. The intratreatment PET scan was performed at a median of 32.4 Gy (interquartile range, 30.6-32.4 Gy). PET features of the primary site including maximum standardized uptake value (SUV), SUV mean, metabolic tumor volume, and total lesion glycolysis were extracted from the pretreatment and intratreatment PET scans. Patients were histopathologic responders if there was complete or near-complete tumor response by modified Ryan scheme. Mean values of PET features were compared between histopathologic responders and nonresponders. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) was used to compare the accuracy of PET features in predicting histopathologic response. Result(s): Eleven patients (42%) were histopathologic responders. PET features most discriminatory of histopathologic response on AUC analysis were volumetric PET features from the intratreatment PET including metabolic tumor volume based on manual contour (AUC, 0.73; 95% confidence interval, 0.52-0.93) and total lesion glycolysis based on semiautomatic 40% SUV threshold (AUC, 0.73; 95% confidence interval, 0.53-0.94).

UNLABELLED: 3'-Deoxy-3'-(18)F-fluorothymidine ((18)F-FLT) is a PET imaging agent that shows promise for studying cellular proliferation in human cancers. FLT is a nucleoside analog that enters cells and is phosphorylated by human thymidine kinase 1, but the 3' substitution prevents further incorporation into DNA. We estimated the radiation dosimetry for this tracer from data gathered in patient studies., METHODS: Time-dependent tissue concentrations of radioactivity were determined from blood samples and PET images of 18 patients after intravenous injection of (18)F-FLT. Radiation-absorbed doses were calculated using the MIRD Committee methods, taking into account variations that were based on the distribution of activities observed in the individual patients. Effective dose equivalent (EDE) was calculated using International Commission on Radiological Protection Publication 60 tissue weighting factors for the standard man and woman., RESULTS: For a single bladder voiding at 6 h after (18)F-FLT injection, the (18)F-FLT EDE (mean +/- SD) was 0.028 +/- 0.012 mSv/MBq (103 +/- 43 mrem/mCi) for a standard male patient and 0.033 +/- 0.012 mSv/MBq (121 +/- 43 mrem/mCi) for a standard female patient. The organ that received the highest dose was the bladder (male, 0.179 mGy/MBq [662 mrad/mCi]; female, 0.174 mGy/MBq [646 mrad/mCi]), followed by the liver (male, 0.045 mGy/MBq [167 mrad/mCi]; female, 0.064 mGy/MBq [238 mrad/mCi]), the kidneys (male, 0.035 mGy/MBq [131 mrad/mCi]; female, 0.042 mGy/MBq [155 mrad/mCi]), and the bone marrow (male, 0.024 mGy/MBq [89 mrad/mCi]; female, 0.033 mGy/MBq [122 mrad/mCi])., CONCLUSION: Organ dose estimates for (18)F-FLT are comparable to those associated with other commonly performed nuclear medicine tests, and the potential radiation risks associated with (18)F-FLT PET imaging are within accepted limits.",Excluded
2372,"Development of Simple Methods to Reduce the Exposure of the Public to Radiation from Patients Who Have Undergone 18F-FDG PET/CT. At a time when reducing the radiation dose to patients and the public has become a major focus, we assessed the radiation exposure rate from patients after an 18F-FDG PET/CT scan and evaluated different interventions to reduce it. Methods: We enrolled 100 patients, divided into 2 groups. For both groups, the radiation dose rate was measured with an ionization survey meter immediately after the scan. For group 1, the patients then voided and their dose rate was measured again. For group 2, the patients waited 30 min before voiding, and we measured the dose rate before (group 2A) and after (group 2B) they voided. Results: In total, 74 of the 100 patients exceeded the 20 muSv/h (2 mR/h) threshold immediately after the scan. In group 1, the mean dose rate decreased by 20.0% from the postscan measurement, with 12 of 36 remaining at or above 20 muSv/h. In group 2A, the mean dose rate decreased by 23% from the postscan measurement, with 9 of 38 remaining at or above 20 muSv/h. In group 2B, the mean dose rate decreased by 35% from the postscan measurement, with 1 of 38 remaining at 20 muSv/h. Conclusion: Nearly 75% of patients undergoing an 18F-FDG PET/CT scan exceed 20 muSv/h when leaving the imaging facility.

Material(s) and Method(s): This study obtained the approval of ethics committee. One-hundred thirty CCTA patients were randomly divided into the low radiation and contrast dose group (group A) and routine dose group (group B) with 65 cases in each group. All patients underwent prospective ECG-triggered CCTA examination. Patients in Group A were scanned with 100 kV with injection of 270 mg-I/ml contrast medium, while patients in group B were scanned 120 kV with injection of 350 mg-I/ml contrast. Image quality, radiation dose (ED) and contrast dose between the two groups were compared. The sensitivity specificity, PPV, NPV and accuracy in-stent restenosis (ISR) were calculated and compared between the two groups. Result(s): Among the 107 measurable stents in group A, there were 14 stents among the 107 measurable stents in group A (13.1%) with ISR diagnosed by ICA. The specificity, sensitivity, PPV and NPV, accuracy in the diagnosis of ISR were 89.2% (83/93) and 85.7% (12/14), 54.5% (12/22) and 97.6% (83/85), 88.8% (95/107), respectively, in group A.

Abnormal presacral FDG uptake with elevated CEA indicates presacral recurrence, whereas positive PET with normal CEA does not usually indicate recurrence. Negative PET with normal CEA can be considered benign avoiding the need for biopsy.",Excluded
208,"The association between cumulative radiation dose and the incidence of severe oral mucositis in head and neck cancers during radiotherapy. Background: Quality of life can be influenced by oral mucositis (OM), and it is necessary to implement OM management strategies before the initiation of radiotherapy (RT) in patients with head and neck cancer (HNC). Aim(s): To examine the association between the cumulative radiation dose and the incidence of severe OM in HNC patients receiving RT. Methods and Results: A retrospective observational cohort study was conducted in a Showa University Fujigaoka Hospital, in Japan. We retrospectively analyzed 94 patients with HNC who developed OM during RT. We defined OM as a more than grade 2 OM. The cumulative incidence of OM curves of the two categories was estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method and compared using the log-rank test. We estimated the hazard ratio (HR) for OM after the adjustment of factors for covariates using Cox's regression analysis. Patients with smoking history had a significantly later development of OM than those with no smoking history (20 Gy-incidence OM 68.7% vs 39.7%, P =.003). In contrast, patients undergoing concurrent chemotherapy had an earlier development of OM than those undergoing RT alone (20 Gy-incidence OM 24.2% vs 55.7%, P <.001). Multivariate analysis revealed that no smoking history and concurrent chemotherapy were independent predictive factors, with a HR of 0.526 (P =.025) and 2.690 (P <.001), respectively. Conclusion(s): We demonstrated that no smoking history and concurrent chemotherapy may be predictive of OM in HNC patients.Copyright © 2020 The Authors.

1668,"A novel strategy of radiofrequency hyperthermia (neothermia) in combination with preoperative chemoradiotherapy for the treatment of advanced rectal cancer: A pilot study. The safety of weekly regional hyperthermia performed with 8 MHz radiofrequency (RF) capacitive heating equipment has been established in rectal cancer. We aimed to standardize hyperthermia treatment for scientific evaluation and for assessing local tumor response to RF hyperthermia in rectal cancer. Forty-nine patients diagnosed with rectal adenocarcinoma were included in the study. All patients received chemoradiation with intensity-modulated radiation therapy 5 days/week (dose, 50 Gy/25 times) concomitant with 5 days/week for five times of capecitabine (1700 mg/m2 per day) and once a week for five times of 50 min irradiations by an 8 MHz RF capacitive heating device. Thirty-three patients underwent surgery 8 weeks after treatment. Three patients did not undergo surgery because of progressive disease (PD) and 13 refused. Eight (16.3%) patients had a pathological complete response (ypCR) after surgery. Among patients without surgery, 3 (6.1%) had clinical complete response (CR) and 3 (6.1%) had local CR but distant PD (CRPD). Ninety percent of ypCR + CR patients were shown in 6.21 W min-1 m-2/treatment or higher group of average total accumulated irradiation output with 429degreeC min-1 m-2 or higher group of total accumulated thermal output. However, a patient with CRPD was in the higher total accumulated thermal output group. We propose a new quantitative parameter for the hyperthermia and demonstrated that patients can benefit from mild irradiation with mild temperature. Using these parameters, the exact output, optimal thermal treatment, and contraindications or indications of this modality could be determined in a multi-institutional, future study.Copyright © 2015 The Authors.",Excluded
3517,"Efficacy of low and high 131I doses for thyroid remnant ablation in patients with differentiated thyroid carcinoma based on post-operative cervical uptake. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to determine the efficacy of low (1110 MBq (30 mCi)) and high (3700 MBq (100 mCi)) 131I doses on the ablation of post-surgical remnants in patients with thyroid cancer based on the measurement of post-operative cervical uptake., METHODS: The study was conducted on 155 patients without metastases after thyroidectomy who received a 1110 or 3700 MBq ablative dose and who were assessed by pre-therapy cervical uptake. The patients were divided into six groups according to the uptake result and the dose received. Successful therapy was defined as a negative scan 6 months to 1 year after ablation., RESULTS: Ablative therapy was successful in 90% of patients with uptake <2% who received the 1110 MBq dose (n=30) and in 92.5% of patients who received the 3700 MBq dose (n=40), P=0.95. In the group with uptakes ranging from 2% to 5%, successful therapy was observed in 65% of patients receiving 1110 MBq (n=20) and in 86.6% of patients receiving 3700 MBq (n=30), P=0.14. In patients with uptake >5%, a 46.6% success rate was obtained for the 1110 MBq dose (n=15), while efficacy was 70% in patients receiving 3700 MBq (n=20), P=0.16., CONCLUSION: This study demonstrated the efficacy of low doses in patients with lower remnants after surgery (uptake <2%), the inverse correlation between uptake and ablation efficacy with low and high doses, and the usefulness of the measurement of cervical uptake for the definition of the ablative 131I dose.",Excluded

Purpose: This investigation focuses on biodistribution of irradiated dendrimer encapsulated ytterbium-175 (175Yb) and to estimate the absorbed dose from intravenous injection of PAMAM encapsulated 175Yb to human organs. Method(s): A dendrimer compound containing an average of 55 Yb+3 ions per dendrimer was prepared and irradiated with neutrons for 2h at 3x1011 n.cm-2s-1 neutron flux. The resulting mixture was injected into a group of tumor bearing mice and the mice were excised, weighed and counted at certain times to study the biodistribution. The human organs absorbed dose was assessed by MIRD schema and MCNP simulation. Result(s): The specific activity and radiochemical purity of the irradiated nano-composite were 7MBq/mg and >99% respectively. The rapid up take of dendrimer was in liver, lung, and, spleen. MIRD and MCNPX were applied for dose estimation. The human absorbed dose in liver, lung, spleen, kidney and bone that simulated by MCNP are 1.266, 0.8081, 0.8347, 0.03979 and 0.01706 mGy/MBq respectively and these values for MIRD schema are 1.351, 0.73, 1.03, 0.039, and 0.0097 mGy/MBq respectively.

381,"Polymorphisms in DNA repair genes and susceptibility to glioma in a Chinese population. The excision repair cross-complementing rodent repair deficiency complementation group 1 (ERCC1), and X-ray repair cross-complementing group 1 (XRCC1) genes appear to protect mammalian cells from the harmful effects of ionizing radiation. We conducted a large case-control study to investigate the association of polymorphisms in ERCC1 C118T, ERCC1 C8092A, XRCC1 A194T, XRCC1 A194T, and XRCC3 C241T, with glioma risk in a Chinese population. Five single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were genotyped, using the MassARRAY IPLEX platform, in 443 glioma cases and 443 controls. Association analyses based on an chi2 test and binary logistic regression were performed to determine the odds ratio (OR) and a 95% confidence interval (95% CI) for each SNP. For XRCC1 Arg194Trp, the variant genotype T/T was strongly associated with a lower risk of glioma cancer when compared with the wild type C/C (OR = 2.45, 95% CI = 1.43-4.45). Individuals carrying the XRCC1 399A allele had an increased risk of glioma (OR = 1.33, 95% CI = 1.02-1.64). The XRCC3 241T/T genotype was associated with a strong increased glioma risk (OR = 3.78, 95% CI = 1.86-9.06). Further analysis of the interactions of two susceptibility-associated SNPs, XRCC1 Arg194Trp and XRCC3 Thr241Met, showed that the combination of the XRCC1 194T and XRCC3 241T alleles brought a large increase in glioma risk (OR = 2.75, 95% CI = 1.54-4.04). XRCC1 Arg194Trp, XRCC1 Arg399Gln, and XRCC3 C241T, appear to be associated with susceptibility to glioma in a Chinese population. © 2013 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.",Excluded
601,"Patients Treated with Preoperative Chemoradiation for Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma have Impaired Bone Density, a Predictor of Distant Metastasis. Background: Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is a lethal neoplasm that spreads to surrounding tissue or distant sites. This study investigated distant metastases in PDAC patients with or without preoperative chemoradiation therapy (CRT), focusing on vitamin D levels and bone density. Method(s): This study included 146 patients with PDAC who underwent surgery from 2007 to 2014. Bone density was evaluated using computed tomography, and the preoperative vitamin D level was calculated by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for patients with available plasma (48 cases). Result(s): When the patients were divided into two groups according to the change in bone density, the group with decreased bone density had a shorter distant metastasis-free survival time (DMFS) after surgery than the other group (p < 0.05). Low vitamin D was a weak predictor of DMFS, but the difference was not significant (p = 0.08), perhaps because of the sample size. Multivariate analysis indicated three significant factors associated with distant metastasis: a decrease in bone density (hazard ratio [HR], 2.17; p = 0.04), normalization of the Dupan-2 value after surgery (hazard ratio [HR], 0.39; p = 0.02), and completion of adjuvant chemotherapy (HR, 0.29; p < 0.01). Univariate analysis showed that a low vitamin D concentration (<20 pg/ml) was a risk factor (p = 0.04) for bone density change. Multivariate analysis found that preoperative CRT was the only factor associated (+/-, OR, 5.8; p = 0.04) with bone density change, suggesting that preoperative CRT significantly decreases bone density in patients with insufficient vitamin D. Conclusion(s): Patients treated with preoperative CRT tend to have impaired bone density, which is a predictor of distant metastasis. Thus, vitamin D supplementation may decrease distant metastasis.Copyright © 2017, Society of Surgical Oncology.",Excluded
3659,"Long-Term Outcomes for Patients With Desmoid Fibromatosis Treated With Radiation Therapy: A 10-Year Update and Re-evaluation of the Role of Radiation Therapy for Younger Patients. Purpose: To update our experience with long-term outcomes in patients with desmoid fibromatosis treated with radiation therapy (RT) and to characterize factors associated with increased risk of local recurrence. Methods and Materials: We reviewed the records of 209 consecutive patients with desmoid fibromatosis treated with RT, either alone or as combined-modality therapy (CMT) with surgery, at our institution from 1965 to 2015. Result(s): Median follow-up time was 98 months (range, 1-509 months). The 5- and 10-year local control (LC) was 71% and 69%, respectively. Fifty-nine patients (28%) experienced a local recurrence at a median time of 23 months (interquartile range, 15-38 months). Among all patients, on multivariable analysis, adjusting for anatomic site, size, age, treatment era (>2005 vs <=2005), treatment approach (RT alone vs CMT), and an interaction between age and treatment, we found only age <=30 years (hazard ratio [HR], 2.94; P =.005; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.38-6.27) and large tumor size >10 cm (HR, 2.51; P =.03; 95% CI, 1.09-5.78) to be correlated with poorer LC. Notably, for patients receiving RT alone, the 5-year LC was 43% for patients <=30 years old versus 75% for >30 years old (P <.001). On multivariable analyses, for patients receiving RT alone, the only factor associated with inferior LC was age <=30 years (HR, 2.87; P =.001; 95% CI, 1.51-5.47). The same was true for patients treated with CMT; age <=30 years was the only factor associated with inferior LC (HR, 5.36; P =.01; 95% CI, 1.40-20.58). Conclusion(s): Among all patients with desmoid fibromatosis, RT is an effective local therapy for tumor control. However, young patients <= 30 years have notably high rates of local recurrence regardless of treatment strategy, which requires further study. Treatment decisions should be risk-adapted by large referral centers with multidisciplinary expertise in desmoid management.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.",Excluded
2853,"Adult-to-adult living donor liver transplantation preoperative survey using MDCT, a single medical center experience in Taiwan. This study evaluated multi-detector computed tomography (MDCT) scans performed on potential living donors for adult-to-adult liver transplantation (LDLT), with the aim of identifying significant findings that could be used to exclude potential transplantation donors. We retrospectively reviewed the medical records of 151 consecutive potential adult donors for LDLT from May 2007 to January 2015. Liver parenchyma steatosis, focal hepatic mass or intraabdominal malignancy, vascular variations, and donor liver volume were evaluated via MDCT. Grounds for excluding potential donors were also recorded and analyzed. Of the 151 potential donors, nine (6.0%) had moderate to severe fatty liver, 37 (24.5%) had hepatic arterial variants, 22 (14.6%) had significant portal venous variants, and more than half were found to have right accessory inferior hepatic vein. No intraabdominal malignancies were found. Eighty-eight potential donors were rejected, with the most common cause being insufficient recipient volume or remnant donor volume (47.7%), moderate to severe parenchymal steatosis (10.2%), and recipient expiration prior to transplantation (8.0%). An additional 16 potential donors were excluded by the surgical team due to the complexity of their portal venous variations. The rate of exclusion by pre-transplant imaging evaluation with MDCT was 33.8%. MDCT can provide accurate quantification of donor liver volume and steatosis severity along with precise demonstration of vascular variants, which are crucial for the preoperative evaluation of LDLT. However, MDCT may be ineffective for evaluating the biliary system without hepatobiliary-excreted contrast agent and has the disadvantage of ionizing radiation.Copyright © 2017",Excluded
2091,"Swimming kinematics and respiratory behaviour of Xenopus laevis larvae raised in altered gravity. We examined the respiratory behaviours and swimming kinematics of Xenopus laevis tadpoles hatched in microgravity (Space Shuttle), simulated microgravity (clinostat) and hypergravity (3 g centrifuge). All observations were made in the normal 1 g environment. Previous research has shown that X. laevis raised in microgravity exhibit abnormalities in their lungs and vestibular system upon return to 1 g. The tadpoles raised in true microgravity exhibited a significantly lower tailbeat frequency than onboard 1 g centrifuge controls on the day of landing (day0), but this behaviour normalized within 9 days. The two groups did not differ significantly in buccal pumping rates. Altered buoyancy in the space-flight microgravity tadpoles was indicated by an increased swimming angle on the day after landing (day1). Tadpoles raised in simulated microgravity differed to a greater extent in swimming behaviours from their 1 g controls. The tadpoles raised in hypergravity showed no substantive effects on the development of swimming or respiratory behaviours, except swimming angle. Together, these results show that microgravity has a transient effect on the development of locomotion in X. laevis tadpoles, most notably on swimming angle, indicative of stunted lung development. On the basis of the behaviours we studied, there is no indication of neuromuscular retardation in amphibians associated with embryogenesis in microgravity.",Excluded
2070,"Patient-reported voice and speech outcomes after whole-neck intensity modulated radiation therapy and chemotherapy for oropharyngeal cancer: Prospective longitudinal study. Purpose To describe voice and speech quality changes and their predictors in patients with locally advanced oropharyngeal cancer treated on prospective clinical studies of organ-preserving chemotherapy-intensity modulated radiation therapy (chemo-IMRT). Methods and Materials Ninety-one patients with stage III/IV oropharyngeal cancer were treated on 2 consecutive prospective studies of definitive chemoradiation using whole-field IMRT from 2003 to 2011. Patient-reported voice and speech quality were longitudinally assessed from before treatment through 24 months using the Communication Domain of the Head and Neck Quality of Life (HNQOL-C) instrument and the Speech question of the University of Washington Quality of Life (UWQOL-S) instrument, respectively. Factors associated with patient-reported voice quality worsening from baseline and speech impairment were assessed. Results Voice quality decreased maximally at 1 month, with 68% and 41% of patients reporting worse HNQOL-C and UWQOL-S scores compared with before treatment, and improved thereafter, recovering to baseline by 12-18 months on average. In contrast, observer-rated larynx toxicity was rare (7% at 3 months; 5% at 6 months). Among patients with mean glottic larynx (GL) dose <=20 Gy, >20-30 Gy, >30-40 Gy, >40-50 Gy, and >50 Gy, 10%, 32%, 25%, 30%, and 63%, respectively, reported worse voice quality at 12 months compared with before treatment (P=.011). Results for speech impairment were similar. Glottic larynx dose, N stage, neck dissection, oral cavity dose, and time since chemo-IMRT were univariately associated with either voice worsening or speech impairment. On multivariate analysis, mean GL dose remained independently predictive for both voice quality worsening (8.1%/Gy) and speech impairment (4.3%/Gy). Conclusions Voice quality worsening and speech impairment after chemo-IMRT for locally advanced oropharyngeal cancer were frequently reported by patients, underrecognized by clinicians, and independently associated with GL dose. These findings support reducing mean GL dose to as low as reasonably achievable, aiming at <=20 Gy when the larynx is not a target. © 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.",Excluded

Context: People being exposed to potentially harmful amounts of radioactive iodine need prophylaxis to prevent high radiation-absorbed doses to the thyroid. Objective(s): Parameters determining the individual protective effect of a pharmacological intervention were investigated. Design and Participants: Biokinetics of 123I was evaluated in 27 healthy volunteers (aged 22-46 yr, median 25 yr, in total 48 assessments) twice in a baseline measurement of the undisturbed kinetics and in an intervention assessment 48 h later. Intervention(s): Seven regimens using single doses of potassium iodide (KI) or sodium perchlorate (SP) at different times relative to exposure were compared: 100 mg KI (-24, 2, 8, 24 h), 100 mg SP (2 h), or 1 g SP (2, 8 h). Main Outcome Measure(s): Different drugs and dosages and the influence of individual parameters of iodine kinetics should be tested.

772,"Gamma Knife surgery for parasellar meningiomas: long-term results including complications, predictive factors, and progression-free survival. OBJECT: Stereotactic radiosurgery serves as an important primary and adjuvant treatment option for patients with many types of intracranial meningiomas. This is particularly true for patients with parasellar meningiomas. In this study, the authors evaluated the outcomes of Gamma Knife surgery (GKS) used to treat parasellar meningiomas., METHODS: The study is a retrospective review of the outcomes in 138 patients with meningiomas treated at the University of Virginia from 1989 to 2006; all patients had a minimum follow-up of 24 months. There were 31 men and 107 women whose mean age was 54 years (range 19-85 years). Eighty-four patients had previously undergone resection. The mean pre-GKS tumor volume was 7.5 ml (range 0.2-54.8 ml). Clinical and radiographic evaluations were performed, and factors related to favorable outcomes in each case were assessed., RESULTS: The mean follow-up duration was 84 months (median 75.5 months, range 24-216 months). In 118 patients (86%), the tumor volume was unchanged or had decreased at last follow-up. Kaplan-Meier analysis demonstrated radiographic progression-free survival at 5 and 10 years to be 95.4% and 69%, respectively. Fourteen patients (10%) developed new cranial nerve palsies following GKS. Factors associated with tumor control included younger age, a higher isodose, and smaller tumor volume. A longer follow-up duration was associated with either a decrease or increase in tumor volume. Fourteen patients (10%) experienced new or worsening cranial nerve deficits after treatment. Factors associated with this occurrence were larger pretreatment tumor volume, lower peripheral radiation dose, lower maximum dose, tumor progression, and longer follow-up., CONCLUSIONS: Gamma Knife surgery offers an acceptable rate of tumor control for parasellar meningiomas and accomplishes this with a low incidence of neurological deficits. Radiological control after radiosurgery is more likely in those patients with a smaller tumor volume and a higher prescription dose.",Excluded
2576,"The possible benefit from total tumour resection in primary diffuse large B-cell lymphoma of central nervous system-a one-decade single-centre experience. Background and methods. The aim of the study was to evaluate retrospectively clinical course of 27 patients with primary central nervous system lymphoma (PCNSL) diagnosed and treated by different surgical approaches. Initial therapy-diagnostic approach included surgery with total tumour reduction (TTR) performed in 12 patients (44.4%), while partial reduction and biopsy were performed in 8 (29.7%) and 7 (25.9%) patients, respectively. All patients were treated with chemotherapy based on high-dose methotrexate (HD-MTX) with/without whole-brain radiotherapy (WBRT). Results. The median overall survival (OS) and event-free survival were 37 and 31 months, respectively, with overall response rate of 74%. The patients who underwent an open surgery with TTR had significantly longer OS (median not reached), comparing with partial tumour reduction or biopsy only (Log-Rank chi2 6.08, p = 0.014) when median OS was 23 months. In patients with performance status according to Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG PS) >= 3, OS was 23 months, contrary to ECOG PS 1-2 when median was not reached. The International Extranodal Lymphoma Study Group score (low, intermediate and high) also influenced OS between three risk groups (Log-Rank chi2 12.5, p = 0.002). Conclusion. The treatment of PCNSL still remains doubtful, however possible benefit from the TTR followed with HD-MTX with/without WBRT should be reconsidered.Copyright © 2015 The Neurosurgical Foundation.",Excluded

2403,"Anatomy versus physiology-guided ablation for persistent atrial fibrillation. Background: Pulmonary vein isolation remains the cornerstone of atrial fibrillation (AF) ablation. However, due to high recurrence rates, especially in patients with persistent AF, PV antral isolation, complemented by linear ablation, autonomic modulation, and ablation of complex fractionated electrograms, have been attempted to increase the odds of success. However, the optimum approach for a complementary strategy in addition to PVI for persistent AF is unknown. Method(s): We performed a prospective randomized trial by assigning 92 patients with persistent AF in 1:1 ratio to pulmonary-vein isolation plus ablation of electrograms showing complex fractionated activity (45 patients), or pulmonary-vein isolation plus additional linear ablation across the left atrial roof and mitral valve isthmus (47 patients). The duration of follow-up was five years. The primary endpoint was freedom from any documented recurrence of atrial fibrillation after a single ablation procedure. Result(s): At a 12-month follow-up, 9 (23%) patients had AF recurrence in the linear ablation and 8 (21%) patients in the CFAE groups. At a mean follow-up duration of 59+/-36 months, 48.3% of patients in the linear ablation group and 44.6% of patients in the CFAE group were free from AF (p=0.403). There were no significant differences between the two groups for independent predictors of freedom from AF. The overall procedure time and radiation exposure were higher in the PVI+linear ablation group. There were five adverse events noted, two in the linear group (pericardial effusion not requiring drain) and 3 in the CFAE group (1 pseudoaneurysm, one effusion requiring pericardiocentesis and one effusion nor requiring drain).

Objective: To determine whether non-linear blending technique for arterial-phase dual-energy abdominal CT angiography (CTA) could improve image quality compared to the linear blending technique and conventional 120 kVp imaging. Material(s) and Method(s): This study included 118 patients who had accepted dual-energy abdominal CTA in the arterial phase. They were assigned to Sn140/80 kVp protocol (protocol A, n = 40) if body mass index (BMI) < 25 or Sn140/100 kVp protocol (protocol B, n = 41) if BMI >= 25. Non-linear blending images and linear blending images with a weighting factor of 0.5 in each protocol were generated and compared with the conventional 120 kVp images (protocol C, n = 37). The abdominal vascular enhancements, image noise, signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR) and radiation dose were assessed. Statistical analysis was performed using one-way analysis of variance test, independent t test, Mann-Whitney U test, and Kruskal-Wallis test. Result(s): Mean vascular attenuation, CNR, SNR and subjective image quality score for the non-linear blending images in each protocol were all higher compared to the corresponding linear blending images and 120 kVp images (p values ranging from < 0.001 to 0.007) except for when compared to non-linear blending images for protocol B and 120 kVp images in CNR and SNR.

Descriptive statistics and Student's t tests were performed., RESULTS: Most institutions use 3-6 phase CT urography protocols (80 %, median DLP 1793-3618mGy.cm) which were associated with 2.4-4.9-fold higher dose compared to 2-phase protocol (20 %, 740mGy.cm) (p<0.0001). Likewise, 52 % patients underwent 3-5 phase routine abdomen- pelvis CT (1574-2945mGy.cm) as opposed to 37 % scanned with a single-phase routine CT (676mGy.cm). The median DLP for urinary stones CT (516mGy.cm) were significantly lower than the median DLP for the other two CT protocols (p<0.0001)., CONCLUSIONS: Few institutions (4/13) use low dose CT for urinary stones. There are substantial variations in CT urography and routine abdomen-pelvis CT protocols result in massive radiation doses (up to 2945-3618mGy.cm). Copyright © 2020 Elsevier B.V.

509,"Definitive radiotherapy with interstitial implant boost for squamous cell carcinoma of the tongue base. BACKGROUND: The purpose of this study was to examine the long-term outcome of a cohort of patients with unresected base of tongue carcinoma who received interstitial brachytherapy after comprehensive external beam radiation therapy., METHODS: Between 1983 and 2000, 122 patients with primary or recurrent squamous cell carcinoma of the oropharynx or oral cavity received interstitial brachytherapy as part of their overall management. Forty patients had primary, unresected carcinoma of the base of tongue and are the subjects of this analysis. The median age was 54 years. Fifty-four percent had T3 or T4 disease, and 70% had clinical or radiographic lymphadenopathy. Twenty-four (60%) received two to three cycles of neoadjuvant chemotherapy. The oropharynx, bilateral neck, and supraclavicular fossae were comprehensively irradiated, and the tongue base received a median external beam dose of 61.2 Gy (50-72 Gy). The primary site was then boosted with an interstitial 192Iridium implant by use of a gold-button single-strand technique and three-dimensional treatment planning. The dose rate was prescribed at 0.4 to 0.5 Gy/hr. The median implant dose was 17.4 Gy (9.6-24 Gy) and adjusted to reach a total dose to the primary tumor of 80 Gy. N2 to 3 disease was managed by a planned neck dissection performed at the time of the implant., RESULTS: The median follow-up for all patients was 56 months, and the overall survival rates were 62% at 5 years and 27% at 10 years. The actuarial primary site control was 78% at 5 years and 70% at 10 years. The overall survival and primary site control were independent of T classification, N status, or overall stage. Systemic therapy was associated with an improvement in overall survival (p = .04) and a trend toward increased primary site control with greater clinical response. There were seven documented late effects, the most frequent being grade 3 osteonecrosis (n = 2), grade 2 swallowing dysfunction (n = 2), trismus (n = 2), and chronic throat pain (n = 1)., CONCLUSIONS: In an era of greatly improved dose distributions made possible by three-dimensional treatment planning and intensity-modulated radiation therapy, brachytherapy allows a highly conformal dose to be delivered in sites such as the oropharynx. If done properly, the procedure is safe and delivers a dose that is higher than what can be achieved by external beam radiation alone with the expected biologic advantages. The long-term data presented here support an approach of treating advanced tongue base lesions that includes interstitial brachytherapy as part of the overall management plan. This approach has led to a 78% rate of organ preservation at 5 years, with a 5% incidence of significant late morbidity (osteonecrosis) that has required medical management.

2985,"Spin echo functional MRI in bilateral auditory cortices at 7T: An application of B1 shimming. Ultra high fields (UHF) permit unprecedented explorations of functional organizations and insight into basic neuronal processes. Increases in the signal and contrast to noise ratios have allowed increases in the spatial resolution of T2* weighted gradient echo (GE) echo planar imaging (EPI). Furthermore, while the use of T2 weighted imaging methods at UHF (e.g. spin echo (SE) EPI, gradient and spin echo (GRASE) EPI) can also permit higher resolution images, they in addition allow for increased spatial specificity of functional responses, permitting the in-vivo study of functional organizations down to the columnar level of the cortex. The study of the visual cortex has, thus far, benefitted the most from higher resolution T2 weighted studies as achieving the required transmit B1 magnitude at 7T is more challenging in other brain regions, such as the auditory cortex. As such, auditory fMRI studies at UHF have been limited to T2* weighted GE sequences. Recent advances in multi-channel RF transmission (e.g. B1 shimming) have enabled procedures to efficiently address deficiencies in transmit B1 profiles. However, these techniques, shown to be advantageous in anatomical imaging at UHF, are not generally utilized to facilitate T2 weighted fMRI studies.Here we investigate the feasibility of applying B1 shimming to achieve efficient RF transmission in the human auditory cortex. We demonstrate that, with B1 shimming, functional responses to simple tones and to complex sounds (i.e. voices, speech, animal cries, tools and nature) can be efficiently measured with T2 weighted SE-EPI in the bilateral human auditory cortex at 7T without exceeding specific absorption rate (SAR) limits. © 2012 Elsevier Inc.",Excluded
476,"Statistical modeling of carcinogenic risks in dogs that inhaled 238PuO2. Combined analyses of data on 260 life-span beagle dogs that inhaled 238PuO2 at the Inhalation Toxicology Research Institute (ITRI) and at Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL) were conducted. The hazard functions (age-specific risks) for incidence of lung, bone and liver tumors were modeled as a function of cumulative radiation dose, and estimates of lifetime risks based on the combined data were developed. For lung tumors, linear-quadratic functions provided an adequate fit to the data from both laboratories, and linear functions provided an adequate fit when analyses were restricted to doses less than 20 Gy. The estimated risk coefficients for these functions were significantly larger when based on ITRI data compared to PNNL data, and dosimetry biases are a possible explanation for this difference. There was also evidence that the bone tumor response functions differed for the two laboratories, although these differences occurred primarily at high doses. These functions were clearly nonlinear (even when restricted to average skeletal doses less than 1 Gy), and evidence of radiation-induced bone tumors was found for doses less than 0.5 Gy in both laboratories. Liver tumor risks were similar for the two laboratories, and linear functions provided an adequate fit to these data. Lifetime risk estimates for lung and bone tumors derived from these data had wide confidence intervals, but were consistent with estimates currently used in radiation protection. The dog-based lifetime liver tumor risk estimate was an order of magnitude larger than that used in radiation protection, but the latter also carries large uncertainties. The application of common statistical methodology to data from two studies has allowed the identification of differences in these studies and has provided a basis for common risk estimates based on both data sets.",Excluded
223,"Intraoperative Gamma Probe Localization of the Ureters: A Novel Concept. Background: Ureteral stent placement to localize the ureters during operations is an invasive procedure. The aim of this study was to evaluate the feasibility of using the gamma probe to intraoperatively identify the ureters after intravenous injection of a radiopharmaceutical agent. Study Design: Ten patients undergoing elective abdominal operations were prospectively enrolled in this study. An average dose of 4.5 mCi (range 2.8 to 5.3 mCi) of technetium Tc 99m-labeled diethylenetriamine pentaacetic acid (99mTc-DTPA) was administered intravenously before localization of the ureters. The gamma probe was used to localize the ureters. Correct identification of the ureters was confirmed when gentle manipulation induced a typical ureteral peristaltic pattern. Result(s): Gamma counts were significantly elevated in all ureters examined. Compared with background counts, gamma counts were increased over the ureter in all patients, with an average increase of 465%. The technique was modified after use in the first 3 patients and standardized for patients 4 through 10. Data from those seven patients were analyzed. Both ureters were correctly identified using the gamma probe at a mean of 15 minutes (median, 10 minutes) after a single 99mTc-DTPA injection (range 4 to 41 minutes). The mean background count was 80 counts per second (cps, range 50 to 130 cps). The mean ureter count was 393 cps (range 128 to 700 cps). The average percent increase of each ureter count compared with its specific background count was 465% (range 256% to 1,077%). The difference was statistically significant for all values (p < 0.001). Conclusion(s): This novel technique of gamma probe localization of the ureters may offer a noninvasive approach for ureteral identification. © 2007 American College of Surgeons.",Excluded

1345,"An analysis of the factors influencing radiation dose and fluoroscopic time during renal artery stent placement. Purpose: To determine the factors that affect mean absorbed dose and fluoroscopic times during renal artery stent placement. Material(s) and Method(s): After institutional review board approval, the HI-IQ database was queried for patients undergoing renal artery stent placement only from January 2007 to June 2010. Procedures that were performed as part of other procedures such as iliac artery stents were excluded. The HI-IQ data included fluoroscopy time (f) and radiation dose (mGy). Demographic, medical history, procedural details, and advanced preprocedural renal artery stent imaging were obtained. Variables (number of stents, average body mass index , number of stents placed per year and number of years service of an interventional physician, pre-procedural imaging, and use of embolic protection device) were analyzed using a t test after log transformation and testing for variance with an F test. Result(s): A total of 134 patients (75 males, 70.6 +/- 10.5 years old) underwent the placement of 177 renal artery stents (unilateral [n =95], average stent per patient =1.3). Mean fluoroscopy time was 15.6 minutes and mean absorbed dose to the patient was 1729 mGy. The average fluoroscopic time and absorbed dose was significantly higher with bilateral stent placement compared to unilateral placement (13.8 vs 19.7 minutes, P =.002; 1803 vs 2380 mGy, P =.03). The average fluoroscopic time was significantly higher in patients undergoing abdominal aortogram prior to renal artery selection and stent placement. Conclusion(s): The placement of more than 1 stent with an abdominal angiogram prior to renal artery stent placement results in increased fluoroscopic time and mean absorbed dose.",Excluded
1720,"Automatic, three-segment, MR-based attenuation correction for whole-body PET/MR data. PURPOSE: The combination of positron emission tomography (PET) and magnetic resonance (MR) tomography in a single device is anticipated to be the next step following PET/CT for future molecular imaging application. Compared to CT, the main advantages of MR are versatile soft tissue contrast and its capability to acquire functional information without ionizing radiation. However, MR is not capable of measuring a physical quantity that would allow a direct derivation of the attenuation values for high-energy photons., METHODS: To overcome this problem, we propose a fully automated approach that uses a dedicated T1-weighted MR sequence in combination with a customized image processing technique to derive attenuation maps for whole-body PET. The algorithm automatically identifies the outer contour of the body and the lungs using region-growing techniques in combination with an intensity analysis for automatic threshold estimation. No user interaction is required to generate the attenuation map., RESULTS: The accuracy of the proposed MR-based attenuation correction (AC) approach was evaluated in a clinical study using whole-body PET/CT and MR images of the same patients (n = 15). The segmentation of the body and lung contour (L-R directions) was evaluated via a four-point scale in comparison to the original MR image (mean values >3.8). PET images were reconstructed using elastically registered MR-based and CT-based (segmented and non-segmented) attenuation maps. The MR-based AC showed similar behaviour as CT-based AC and similar accuracy as offered by segmented CT-based AC. Standardized uptake value (SUV) comparisons with reference to CT-based AC using predefined attenuation coefficients showed the largest difference for bone lesions (mean value +/- standard variation of SUV(max): -3.0% +/- 3.9% for MR; -6.5% +/- 4.1% for segmented CT). A blind comparison of PET images corrected with segmented MR-based, CT-based and segmented CT-based AC afforded identical lesion detectability, but slight differences in image quality were found., CONCLUSION: Our MR-based attenuation correction method offers similar correction accuracy as offered by segmented CT. According to the specialists involved in the blind study, these differences do not affect the diagnostic value of the PET images.",Excluded
374,"Diagnosis and treatment of lumbosacral plexopathies in patients with cancer. Eleven patients were diagnosed as having lumbosacral plexopathy at M. D.

Four causes were documented: plexopathy secondary to metastatic disease (six cases); radiation-induced plexopathy (two cases); plexopathy secondary to intra-arterial chemotherapy (two cases); and plexopathy as the result of a second primary tumor (one case). Patients with plexopathies secondary to tumor or irradiation complained of pain in the ipsilateral lower extremity. Computed tomography of the pelvis was the most accurate method of documenting tumor in the region of the lumbosacral plexus. Radiation therapy records of patients with cervical carcinoma were reviewed with respect to positioning of intracavitary radium, which was thought to be responsible for the development of radiation-induced plexopathies.

693,"Metformin use and improved response to therapy in rectal cancer. Locally advanced rectal cancer is commonly treated with chemoradiation prior to total mesorectal excision (TME). Studies suggest that metformin may be an effective chemopreventive agent in this disease as well as a possible adjunct to current therapy. In this study, we examined the effect of metformin use on pathologic complete response (pCR) rates and outcomes in rectal cancer. The charts of 482 patients with locally advanced rectal adenocarcinoma treated from 1996 to 2009 with chemoradiation and TME were reviewed. Median radiation dose was 50.4 Gy (range 19.8-63). Nearly, all patients were treated with concurrent 5-fluorouracil-based chemotherapy (98%) followed by adjuvant chemotherapy (81.3%). Patients were categorized as nondiabetic (422), diabetic not taking metformin (40), or diabetic taking metformin (20). No significant differences between groups were found in clinical tumor classification, nodal classification, tumor distance from the anal verge or circumferential extent, pretreatment carcinoembryonic antigen level, or pathologic differentiation. pCR rates were 16.6% for nondiabetics, 7.5% for diabetics not using metformin, and 35% for diabetics taking metformin, with metformin users having significantly higher pCR rates than either nondiabetics (P = 0.03) or diabetics not using metformin (P = 0.007). Metformin use was significantly associated with pCR rate on univariate (P = 0.05) and multivariate (P = 0.01) analyses. Furthermore, patients taking metformin had significantly increased disease-free (P = 0.013) and overall survival (P = 0.008) compared with other diabetic patients. Metformin use is associated with significantly higher pCR rates as well as improved survival. These promising data warrant further prospective study. © 2013 The Authors.

Out of 30 patients who underwent RHC for soft tissue sarcoma at our Institution, 6 were enrolled into this study to undergo a second-look operation for unplanned excision. Radiotherapy was given to a total dose of 32 Gy. Hyperthermia was conducted once a week, for a total of five sessions. Chemotherapy was performed at weekly intervals. Surgery was performed to excise the scar tissue that was enhanced on preoperative MRI. In all six cases, no residual tumors were identified in resected scar tissue; thus, no additional wide excision was performed. The average follow-up period was 10.9 years. There were no local recurrences, and all patients were alive at their final follow-up. Long-term followup confirmed that RHC can replace additional wide excision for unplanned excision of soft tissue sarcoma.",Excluded

Objective: To review our experience with concurrent chemoradiotherapy (CCRT) for patients with advanced resectable squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) of the larynx and to evaluate the factors affecting survival and larynx preservation. Study design: Retrospective study. Subjects and methods: The records of 102 patients with stage III or IV resectable SCC of the larynx treated with CCRT between February 1994 and March 2009 were reviewed. Of 102 patients, 59 were treated with high-dose regimens, including cisplatin, 5-fluorouracil (5-FU), methotrexate, and leucovorin or docetaxel, cisplatin, and 5-FU, and 43 were treated with low-dose regimens, including carboplatin and uracil-tegafur or S-1. Radiotherapy was delivered 5 days a week using a single daily fraction of 1.8-2.0 Gray (Gy), to a total dose of 66.0-70.2 Gy. Overall survival (OS), disease-specific survival (DSS), and DSS with larynx preservation were estimated using Kaplan-Meier methods. The log-rank test and Cox proportional hazards regression were used to identify significant prognostic factors for DSS and DSS with larynx preservation. Result(s): The 5-year OS and DSS for all patients treated with CCRT were 63.9 and 70.7 %, respectively. The 5-year DSS with larynx preservation was 54.1 %. On multivariate analysis, N stage, synchronous multiple primary cancers, and the contents of chemotherapy were significant predictors of OS for patients undergoing CCRT; T stage, N stage, and the contents of chemotherapy were significant prognostic factors for larynx preservation.

2634,"Growth hormone mitigates against lethal irradiation and enhances hematologic and immune recovery in mice and nonhuman primates. Medications that can mitigate against radiation injury are limited. In this study, we investigated the ability of recombinant human growth hormone (rhGH) to mitigate against radiation injury in mice and nonhuman primates. BALB/c mice were irradiated with 7.5 Gy and treated post-irradiation with rhGH intravenously at a once daily dose of 20 mug/dose for 35 days. rhGH protected 17 out of 28 mice (60.7%) from lethal irradiation while only 3 out of 28 mice (10.7%) survived in the saline control group. A shorter course of 5 days of rhGH post-irradiation produced similar results. Compared with the saline control group, treatment with rhGH on irradiated BALB/c mice significantly accelerated overall hematopoietic recovery. Specifically, the recovery of total white cells, CD4 and CD8 T cell subsets, B cells, NK cells and especially platelets post radiation exposure were significantly accelerated in the rhGH-treated mice. Moreover, treatment with rhGH increased the frequency of hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells as measured by flow cytometry and colony forming unit assays in bone marrow harvested at day 14 after irradiation, suggesting the effects of rhGH are at the hematopoietic stem/progenitor level. rhGH mediated the hematopoietic effects primarily through their niches. Similar data with rhGH were also observed following 2 Gy sublethal irradiation of nonhuman primates. Our data demonstrate that rhGH promotes hematopoietic engraftment and immune recovery post the exposure of ionizing radiation and mitigates against the mortality from lethal irradiation even when administered after exposure. © 2010 Chen et al.",Excluded
3558,"Predicting urban outdoor thermal comfort by the Universal Thermal Climate Index UTCI-a case study in Southern Brazil. Recognising that modifications to the physical attributes of urban space are able to promote improved thermal outdoor conditions and thus positively influence the use of open spaces, a survey to define optimal thermal comfort ranges for passers-by in pedestrian streets was conducted in Curitiba, Brazil. We applied general additive models to study the impact of temperature, humidity, and wind, as well as long-wave and short-wave radiant heat fluxes as summarised by the recently developed Universal Thermal Climate Index (UTCI) on the choice of clothing insulation by fitting LOESS smoothers to observations from 944 males and 710 females aged from 13 to 91 years. We further analysed votes of thermal sensation compared to predictions of UTCI. The results showed that females chose less insulating clothing in warm conditions compared to males and that observed values of clothing insulation depended on temperature, but also on season and potentially on solar radiation. The overall pattern of clothing choice was well reflected by UTCI, which also provided for good predictions of thermal sensation votes depending on the meteorological conditions. Analysing subgroups indicated that the goodness-of-fit of the UTCI was independent of gender and age, and with only limited influence of season and body composition as assessed by body mass index. This suggests that UTCI can serve as a suitable planning tool for urban thermal comfort in sub-tropical regions. © 2011 ISB.",Excluded

Primary and secondary outcome measures Overall survival and survival rates determined by Kaplan-Meier method, groups compared by log-rank test. Associations between clinical characteristics and treatment approach assessed by logistic regression. Associations between treatment approach and outcome analysed by Cox regression. Results Median overall survival was 10.2 months (95% CI 9.1 to 11.3). Resection was performed in 221 patients (60.9%), and was inversely associated with age over 70 years, higher comorbidity burden, deep-seated tumour localisation and multifocality. Median survival was 13.7 months (95% CI 12.1 to 15.4) in patients undergoing tumour resection, 8.3 months (95% CI 6.6 to 9.9) in patients undergoing biopsy and 4.5 months (95% CI 4.0 to 5.1) in patients where no surgical intervention was performed. Chemoradiotherapy according to the Stupp protocol was given to 157 patients (43%). Age over 70 years, higher comorbidity burden and cognitive impairment were associated with less intensive chemoradiotherapy. Median survival was 16.3 months (95% CI 14.1 to 18.5), 7.9 months (95% CI 6.7 to 9.0) and 2.0 months (95% CI 0.9 to 3.2) in patients treated according to the Stupp protocol, with less intensive chemoradiotherapy and with best supportive care, respectively. Surgical resection (HR 0.61 (95% CI 0.47 to 0.79)) and chemoradiotherapy according to the Stupp protocol (HR 0.09 (95% CI 0.06 to 0.15)) were strongly associated with favourable overall survival, when adjusted for clinical variables. Conclusions In a real-world setting, less than half of the patients received full-course chemoradiotherapy, with a median survival comparable to results from clinical trials. Survival was considerably worse in patients receiving less intensive treatment. Our results point out a substantial risk of undertreating glioblastoma, especially in elderly patients.Copyright © Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2021. Re-use permitted under CC BY-NC.

Six MeV electrons were used for intraoperative irradiation, and external beam irradiation was done using photons from a 6 MV linear accelerator. The psoas muscle in the irradiation field was examined histomorphometrically 2 or 5 years after irradiation. The percentage of muscle fibers and capillaries decreased, whereas the percentage of connective tissue increased with increased dose for both intraoperative irradiation only and intraoperative irradiation plus external beam irradiation. The dose causing a 50% decrease in the percentage of muscle fibers was 21.2 Gy and 33.8 Gy at 2 and 5 years, respectively, after intraoperative irradiation alone, and 22.9 Gy and 25.2 Gy at 2 and 5 years, respectively, after intraoperative irradiation combined with 50 Gy external beam irradiation. The ED50 for severe vessel lesions was 19.2 Gy and 25.8 Gy at 2 and 5 years, respectively, after intraoperative irradiation alone and 16.0 Gy and 18.0 Gy at 2 and 5 years, respectively, after intraoperative irradiation combined with 50 Gy external beam irradiation. External beam irradiation alone caused a slight decrease in percentage of muscle fibers with increased dose, and vessel lesions were infrequent or mild. Radiation-induced muscle injury was characterized by loss of muscle fibers, decreased fiber size, severe vessel lesions, hemorrhage, inflammation, coagulation necrosis, and fibrosis. These histopathologic characteristics distinguish this muscle injury from that caused by neurogenic atrophy. These data indicate that radiation-induced muscle injury most likely was caused by injury of the supporting vasculature. The lesions produced were largely a function of the single intraoperative dose rather than the external beam fractionated doses. Furthermore, it appears that 20 to 25 Gy intraoperative irradiation combined with 50 Gy external beam irradiation may be near the maximum tolerated dose by sublumbar musculature and its supporting vasculature.",Excluded

Purpose: In patients with locally advanced rectal cancer (LARC), preoperative chemoradiation is known to improve local control, and down-staging of the tumor serves as a surrogate for survival. Intensification of the systemic therapy may lead to higher down- staging rates and, thus, enhance survival. This phase II study investigated the efficacy and safety of preoperative capecitabine and oxaliplatin in combination with radiotherapy. Patients and Methods: Patients with LARC of the mid and lower rectum, T3NxM0 staged by MRI received radiotherapy (total dose 45 Gy) in combination with oral capecitabine (825 mg/m2 twice a day on radiotherapy days; weeks 1-4) and oxaliplatin 50 mg/m2 intravenously (days 1, 8, 15, and 22). Efficacy was evaluated as rate of tumor down-categorization at the T level. Result(s): A total of 59 patients were enrolled (19 women, 40 men; median age of 61 years) and all were evaluable for efficacy and toxicity. Down-categorization at the T level was observed in 53% with pathological complete response in 6 patients (10%). Actual total radiotherapy, oxaliplatin and capecitabine doses received were 97%, 90%, and 93% of the protocol-specified preplanned doses, respectively. Grade 3/4 toxicity was observed in 15 patients (25%). The most frequent was diarrhea (12%). Conclusion(s): Preoperative chemoradiation with capecitabine and oxaliplatin is feasible in patients with MRI-proven cT3 LARC. The only clinically relevant toxicity was diarrhea. Overall, efficacy of the multimodality treatment was good, but not markedly exceeding that of 5-FU- or capecitabine-based chemoradiation approaches. © Urban & Vogel.",Excluded

159,"Intentional outdoor tanning in the United States: Results from the 2015 Summer ConsumerStyles survey. There is limited literature about adults in the United States who usually or always spend time outdoors for the purpose of developing a tan, defined as intentional outdoor tanning. Using data from the 2015 Summer ConsumerStyles, an online cross-sectional survey weighted to the US adult population (n = 4,127), we performed unadjusted and adjusted multivariable logistic regressions to examine the associations between demographic characteristics, behaviors, and belief factors related to skin cancer risk and intentional outdoor tanning. Nearly 10% of the study population intentionally tanned outdoors. Outdoor tanning was more prevalent among women (11.4%), non-Hispanic white individuals (11.5%), those aged 18-29 years (14.1%), those without a high school diploma (12.7%), and those in the northeast United States (13.2%). The adjusted odds of outdoor tanning were significantly higher among women than men (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] 1.51, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.12-2.04); those with a history of indoor tanning or recent sunburn than those without (AOR 2.61, CI 1.94-3.51; AOR 1.96, CI 1.46-2.63, respectively); those who agreed they looked better with a tan than those who did not (AOR 6.69, CI 3.62-12.35); and those who did not try to protect their skin from the sun when outdoors than those who did (AOR 2.17, CI 1.56-3.04). Adults who engaged in other risky behaviors that expose a person to ultraviolet (UV) radiation were more likely to tan outdoors, further increasing their risk of skin cancer. These findings may guide potential interventions to reduce UV exposure from outdoor tanning.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Inc.",Excluded
2629,"Accelerated postoperative radiotherapy with weekly concomitant boost in patients with locally advanced head and neck cancer. BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: To assess the feasibility and efficacy of accelerated 66-Gy postoperative radiotherapy (PORT) using a single-fraction regimen from Mondays to Thursdays and a concomitant boost on Friday afternoon sessions in patients with locally advanced head and neck cancer (LAHNC)., PATIENTS AND METHODS: Between December 1997 and June 2002, 89 consecutive patients with pT1-pT4 and/or pN0-pN3 LAHNC were included. PORT was indicated in patients with positive surgical margins, T4 tumors, or extracapsular nodal infiltration. RT consisted of 66 Gy (2 Gy/fr) in 5 weeks and 3 days. Median follow-up was 21 months (range 2-59)., RESULTS: Acute morbidity was acceptable: grade 3 mucositis in 20 (22%) patients, grade 3 dysphagia in 22 (25%) patients, and grade 3 skin erythema in 18 (20%) patients. Median weight loss was 2 kg (range 0-14.5). No grade 4 toxicity was observed. Late effects included grade 3 xerostomia in 6 (7%) patients, and grade 3 edema in 2 (2%) patients. Median time to locoregional relapse was 10 months (range 2-21). Two-year overall, cause-specific, and disease-free survival rates were 70% (95% confidence interval (CI) 59-81), 75% (95% CI 64-86), and 63% (95% CI 52-74), respectively. The 2-year actuarial locoregional control rate was 80% (95% CI 70-90). Distant metastasis probability at 4 years was 38% (95% CI 20-56). Multivariate analysis revealed that pT-classification (pT1-2 vs. pT3-4) and extranodal extension (0, 1 vs. 2 or more) were the two factors independently influencing the outcome., CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that reducing the overall treatment time using an accelerated PORT schedule including a once-weekly concomitant boost (six fractions per week) is easily feasible with excellent local control. Acute and late RT-related morbidity is acceptable. Given the disease progression pattern (distant metastases), adjuvant chemotherapy should be considered.",Excluded
179,"Quantitative impact of small angle forward scatter on whole blood oximetry using a Beer-Lambert absorbance model. It is well known that red blood cell scattering has an impact on whole blood oximetry as well as in vivo retinal oxygen saturation measurements. The goal of this study was to quantify the impact of small angle forward scatter on whole blood oximetry for scattering angles found in retinal oximetry light paths. Transmittance spectra of whole blood were measured in two different experimental setups: one that included small angle scatter in the transmitted signal and one that measured the transmitted signal only, at absorbance path lengths of 25, 50, 100, 250 and 500 microm. Oxygen saturation was determined by multiple linear regression in the 520-600 nm wavelength range and compared between path lengths and experimental setups. Mean calculated oxygen saturation differences between setups were greater than 10% at every absorbance path length. The deviations to the Beer-Lambert absorbance model had different spectral dependences between experimental setups, with the highest deviations found in the 520-540 nm range when scatter was added to the transmitted signal. These results are consistent with other models of forward scatter that predict different spectral dependences of the red blood cell scattering cross-section and haemoglobin extinction coefficients in this wavelength range.",Excluded
624,"Can the implementation of aerospace science in elementary school help girls maintain their confidence and engagement in science as they transition to middle school?. There is a global crisis due to a lack of qualified applicants entering STEM careers, especially in science. Add the fact that women are greatly underrepresented in science, and the solution becomes obvious. Go to the source, and find out why girls as young as 12 years old are losing an interest in scientific endeavors that they once found to be captivating. This action research project sought to find out if the implementation of aerospace science, embedded both in the classroom and in an after school Space Club, could assist girls in maintaining their confidence and engagement in science overall as they transition to middle school. Furthermore, girls in fifth through seventh grade, who had previously been the teacher researcher's students, were included in the study in order to discover if their previous participation in a variety of authentic and ongoing aerospace activities had any impact upon their engagement in science as they entered the notable years of declined interest. The research took place at an international American school, Academia Cotopaxi, in Quito, Ecuador from September 2015 through April 2016. Data was collected through both qualitative and quantitative sources, and included attitude surveys, parent questionnaires, a writing prompt, photos, video, interviews and observations. Additionally, a control group was utilized in grades five to seven for purposes of comparison. Innovative activities included engaging and first-hand experiences with the Ecuadorian Civilian Space Agency (EXA), the National Aeronautics Space Administration (NASA), Space X and the Canadian Space Agency (CSA). Inquiry-based activities included, but were not limited to, experiences with: speaking live with both astronauts and cosmonauts on the International Space Station, robotics, rocketry, Skype chats with aerospace professionals, utilizing the Design Process, online resources and more. Findings suggested that embedding aerospace science in grade four, both during and after school hours, not only increased girls' interest and confidence in science, but also served to maintain and foster an interest in STEM as they transitioned to middle school.

315,"Aldehyde dehydrogenase, a therapeutic target in chordoma: Analysis in 3d cellular models. Chordomas are rare, slow-growing tumors of the axial skeleton. These tumors are locally aggressive and refractory to conventional therapies. Radical surgery and radiation remain the first-line treatments. Despite these aggressive treatments, chordomas often recur and second-line treatment options are limited. The mechanisms underlying chordoma radioresistance remain unknown, although several radioresistant cancer cells have been shown to respond favorably to aldehyde de-hydrogenase (ALDH) inhibition. The study of chordoma has been delayed by small patient cohorts and few available models due to the scarcity of these tumors. We thus created cellular 3D models of chordoma by using low-adherence culture systems. Then, we evaluated their radiosensitivity using colony-forming and spheroid size assays. Finally, we determined whether pharmacologically inhibiting ALDH increased their radiosensitivity. We found that 3D cellular models of chordoma (derived from primary, relapse, and metastatic tumors) reproduce the histological and gene expression features of the disease. The metastatic, relapse, and primary spheroids displayed high, me-dium, and low radioresistance, respectively. Moreover, inhibiting ALDH decreased the radiore-sistance in all three models.Copyright © 2021 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.",Excluded
442,"Long-haul flights, edema, and thrombotic events: Prevention with stockings and Pycnogenol supplementation (LONFLIT Registry Study). BACKGROUND: This registry study evaluated the effects of Pycnogenol on edema and thrombotic complications in long-haul flights; jet lag was also evaluated. METHOD(S): Four hundred and fifty subjects at different risk levels for thrombosis, flying in economy class twice in less than a week for more than 8 hours, were included; 295 completed the registry study and were subdivided in 3 groups according to their risk level - low, moderate, or high. The high-risk group also received Aspirin. Astandard management (SM) was used in all groups. In each risk category, three groups were made according to patient management: A Pycnogenol group, a SM group (control), and a stockings group. The groups were comparable at inclusion. No side effects were observed. RESULT(S): In the low risk group edema were reduced more (P<0.05) with Pycnogenol and stockings compared to control. Ankle circumference was smaller with Pycnogenol (P<0.05). No thrombosis was detected. D-dimer was negative in Pycnogenol subjects; one subject in the control group had increased values, as did two of the 36 subjects in the stockings group. In the group with moderate risk, edema and ankle circumference were lower in the Pycnogenol group (P<0.05). One deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and one minimal superficial vein thrombosis (SVT) was seen in controls. D-dimer was normal in the Pycnogenol group. In high-risk subjects, edema, and ankle circumference were significantly reduced in the Pycnogenol group (P<0.05). There were no SVT or DVT in the Pycnogenol group. One minimal DVT and one SVT were observed in controls. D-dimer was negative in all Pycnogenol subjects (P<0.05); three post-flight values increased in controls and in four of the 32 subjects in the stockings group. The jet lag score was lower in low-, medium-, and high-risk Pycnogenol subjects (P<0.05).

OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the usefulness of low-dose MDCT for radiologic monitoring of patients who have undergone placement of bronchial stents for airway bypass., SUBJECTS AND METHODS: In a prospective study, seven patients underwent MDCT according to a low-dose protocol (40 mAs, 120 kVp) before and after stent placement. The positions of the stents in the segmental bronchi were analyzed and compared with the bronchoscopic findings, which were reference standard. Patency versus lack of patency of stents was classified with five levels of confidence, and a definitive diagnosis was assigned to each stent. Prediction of stent dislodgment, follow-up findings, and complications occurring during the observation period were recorded. Consensus reading was performed by two radiologists. Statistical analysis was conducted by receiver operating characteristic analysis or four-field table., RESULTS: Seven patients underwent implantation of 37 stents (mean, 5 +/- 2 [SD] stents per patient; range, 2-8 stents). The area under the curve for differentiating patent from occluded stents was 0.995 with resulting sensitivity and specificity of 86.5% and 98.1%. The correct diagnosis of patency was established with MDCT for all but one stent (sensitivity, 94.7%; specificity, 100%). Sensitivity and specificity for prediction of dislodgment were 80% and 91%. Five stents were not identified during inspection bronchoscopy but were found in a regular position at MDCT. Three instances of minor bleeding and one of pneumothorax resolved spontaneously. The mean effective dose of the scan was 1.3 +/- 0.6 mSv., CONCLUSION: Low-dose MDCT is feasible for radiologic monitoring after airway bypass procedure.",Excluded
1438,"Preliminary exploration of tolerability in preoperative stereotactic ablation radiotherapy combined with surgical treatment for renal cell carcinoma and inferior vena cava tumor thrombus. Background and objectives Stereotactic ablation radiotherapy (SABR) has shown excellent control rates for renal cell carcinoma (RCC) currently. But relatively few studies expatiated the tolerability and safety of preoperative SABR combined with surgical treatment for RCC and inferior vena cava tumor thrombus (IVC-TT). Materials and methods The clinical data of six patients with level II IVC-TT was prospectively collected. Treatment planning CT with slice thickness of 1 milimeter and MRI was fused for target delineation. The IVC-TT received a total radiation dose of 30 Gy in six 5 Gy fractions, calculated with a Monte Carlo algorithms.The dose was prescribed to the 84% isodose line via 100-150 non-coplanar photon beams of 6 MV and 3D optimization ensuring >95% target volume (PTV) coverage. After completion of SABR, the patients underwent thrombectomy. Doselimiting toxicity (DLT) was defined as grade 3 or worse gastrointestinal/ genitourinary toxicity by Common Terminology Criteria of Adverse Events (version 4). Postoperative complications were graded according to the modified Clavien classifications, respectively. Results A total of 6 patients (4 men and 2 women) were treated on protocol. After 7-14 days, 3 patients underwent open radical nephrectomy and inferior vena cava thrombectomy and 3 patients underwent pure laparoscopic surgery. All 6 patients tolerated SABR well without possibly treatment-related acute toxicities. The average surgery time was (383.3 +/-88.7) min. The average blood loss volume was (1475.0 +/- 1515.8) mL. 2 cases underwent inferior vena cava wall resection because of tumor invasion. The average postoperative hospitalization of was (5.8 +/-1.2) d. Early postoperative complications occurred in 4 case of Clavien I according to modified Clavien classifications. Median (range) follow-up was 8 months (1-22 months). There was no postoperative recurrence or tumor specific death. Conclusion Our initial clinical results show that dose of 30 Gy in 6 fraction has been achieved successfully without treatment-related acute toxicities. preoperative SABR combined with surgical treatment was relatively safe.",Excluded

The aim of this study was to determine dose-volume histogram parameters and other factors that predict renal atrophy after 10-fraction stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) for primary renal cell carcinoma (RCC)., METHODS: A total of 14 patients (11 males, 3 females) who received SBRT for RCC at Tohoku University Hospital between April 2010 and February 2014 were analyzed. The median serum creatinine level was 1.1 mg/dl and two patients had a single kidney. Nine patients were implanted with fiducial markers. The median tumor diameter was 30 mm. SBRT was delivered at 70 Gy in 10 fractions for 7 tumors, at 60 Gy in 10 fractions for 2 tumors, and at 50 Gy in 10 fractions for 5 tumors with 6 and/or 15 MV X-ray using 5 to 8 multi-static beams. Renal atrophy was assessed using post-SBRT CT images after 12-24 months intervals. Correlations were examined by Spearman rank correlation analysis. Differences between two groups were evaluated by the Mann-Whitney test, and pairwise comparisons were made by the Wilcoxon signed-rank test., RESULTS: The median tumor volume shrunk from 14.8 cc to 10.6 cc (p = 0.12), and the median irradiated kidney volume changed from 160.4 cc to 137.1 cc (p < .01). The median peak creatinine level was 1.6 mg/dl after treatment (p < .01). Percentage volumes of the irradiated kidney receiving at least 10 Gy (V10, p = 0.03), V20 (p < .01), V30(p < .01), V40 (p = 0.01), mean irradiated kidney dose (p < .01), and magnitude of overlap between PTV and kidney volume (p = 0.03) were significantly correlated with post-treatment irradiated kidney volume in percent, and V20-V30 had strong correlation (r < -0.70, p < .01). Patients with implanted fiducial markers showed a significantly lower ratio of renal atrophy (p = 0.02)., CONCLUSIONS: Significant renal atrophic change was observed. Dose distribution of SBRT at 20-30 Gy had a strong correlation with renal atrophy when irradiation was performed in 10 fractions.",Excluded
1226,"Diagnostic accuracy of small intestine ultrasonography using an oral contrast agent in Crohn's disease: comparative study from the UK. AIM: To evaluate the usefulness of small intestine contrast-enhanced ultrasonography (SICUS) using an oral contrast agent in routine clinical practice by assessing the level of agreement with the established techniques, small bowel follow-through (SBFT) and computed tomography (CT), and diagnostic accuracy compared with the final diagnosis in the detection of small bowel Crohn's disease (CD) and luminal complications in a regional centre., MATERIALS AND METHODS: All symptomatic known or suspected cases of CD who underwent SICUS were retrospectively reviewed. The level of agreement between SICUS and SBFT, CT, histological findings, and C-reactive protein (CRP) level was assessed using kappa (kappa) coefficient. Sensitivity was demonstrated using the final diagnosis as the reference standard defined by the outcome of clinical assessment, follow-up, and results of investigations other than SICUS., RESULTS: One hundred and forty-three patients underwent SICUS of these 79 (55%) were female. Eighty-six (60%) were known to have CD and 57 (40%) had symptoms suggestive of intestinal disease with no previous diagnosis. Forty-six (55%) of the known CD patients had had at least one previous surgical resection. The sensitivity of SICUS in detecting active small bowel CD in known CD and undiagnosed cases was 93%. The kappa coefficient was 0.88 and 0.91 with SBFT and CT, respectively. SICUS detected nine patients who had one or more small bowel strictures and six patients with a fistula all detected by SBFT or CT., CONCLUSION: SICUS is not only comparable to SBFT and CT but avoids radiation exposure and should be more widely adopted in the UK as a primary diagnostic procedure and to monitor disease complications in patients with CD.

2876,"Collagen organisation in the interspinous ligament and its relationship to tissue function. X-ray diffraction and determination of optical anisotropy show that collagen fibres in pig and human lumbar interspinous ligaments tend to be orientated parallel to the spinous processes. There is a distribution of fibre orientations about this preferred direction. Flexion of the spine does not change the direction of preferred orientation but the angular spread of fibres increases. This pattern of collagen fibre orientations is consistent with the interspinous ligaments being able to transmit tension from the thoracolumbar fascia to the vertebrae. Since the collagen fibres tend to be aligned antero-posteriorly, they provide a high efficiency of reinforcement in this direction. The lack of fibres orientated perpendicular to the spinous processes will lead to low strength in the cranio-caudal direction so that the ligament can provide little resistance to flexion of the spine.",Excluded

OBJECTIVES: To determine the feasibility of automated co-registration of angiography and intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) to facilitate integration of these two imaging modalities in a synchronous manner., BACKGROUND: IVUS provides cross-sectional imaging of coronary arteries but lacks overview of the vascular territory provided by angiography. Co-registration of angiography and IVUS would increase utility of IVUS in the clinical setting., METHODS: Forty-nine consecutive patients undergoing surveillance for cardiac allograft vasculopathy with angiography and IVUS of the left anterior descending artery (LAD) were enrolled. A pre-IVUS angiogram of the LAD was performed followed by an ECG-triggered fluoroscopy (ECGTF) during IVUS pullback at 0.5 mm/s using an automatic pullback device. ECGTF was used to track the IVUS catheter during pullback and establish a spatial relationship to the pre-IVUS angiogram. Angio-IVUS co-registration was performed with a research prototype (Siemens Healthcare, Germany) and accuracy was evaluated by distance mismatch between angiography and IVUS images at vessel bifurcations., RESULTS: Median age was 54 (44.5, 67) years. The population was 82.6% male with minimal risk factors. The median (IQR) co-registration distance mismatch measured at 108 bifurcations in 42 (85%) patients was 0.35 (0.00-1.16) mm. Seven patients were excluded due to inappropriate data acquisition (n = 3) and failure of tracking (n = 4), e.g., due to overlapping sternal wires. Estimated effective radiation dose for ECGTF was 0.09 mSv., CONCLUSION: This study demonstrates the feasibility of angio-IVUS co-registration which may be used as a clinical tool for localizing IVUS cross-sections along an angiographic roadmap. © 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

3105,"Histopathological examination of spine tumors after treatment with radiosurgery. OBJECTIVE Increased survival time after diagnosis of neoplastic disease has resulted in a gradual increase in spine tumor incidence. Radiosurgery is frequently a viable alternative to operative management in a population with severe medical comorbidities. The authors sought to assess the histopathological consequences of radiosurgery in the subset of patients progressing to operative intervention. METHODS Eighteen patients who underwent radiosurgery for spine tumors between 2008 and 2014 subsequently progressed to surgical treatment. A histopathological examination of these cases was performed. Indications for surgery included symptomatic compression fractures, radiographic instability, and symptoms of cord or cauda equina compression. Biopsy samples were obtained from the tumor within the radiosurgical zone in all cases and were permanently fixated. Viable tumor samples were stained for Ki 67. RESULTS Fifteen patients had metastatic lesions and 3 patients had neurofibromas. The mean patient age was 57 years. The operative indication was symptomatic compression in 10 cases (67%). The most frequent metastatic lesions were breast cancer (4 cases), renal cell carcinoma (3), prostate cancer (2), and endometrial cancer (2). In 9 (60%) of the 15 metastatic cases, histological examination of the lesions showed minimal evidence of inflammation. Viable tumor at the margins of the radiosurgery was seen in 9 (60%) of the metastatic cases. Necrosis in the tumor bed was frequent, as was fibrotic bone marrow. Vascular ectasia was seen in 2 of 15 metastatic cases, but sclerosis with ectasia was frequent. No evidence of malignant conversion was seen in the periphery of the lesions in the 3 neurofibroma cases. In 1 case of neurofibroma, the lesion demonstrated some small areas of remnant tumor in the radiosurgical target zone. CONCLUSIONS This case series demonstrates important histopathological characteristics of spinal lesions treated by SRS. Regions with the highest exposure to radiation appear to be densely necrotic and show little evidence of tumor growth, whereas peripheral regions distant from the radiation dosage are more likely to demonstrate viable tumor in malignant and benign neoplasms. Physiological tissue appears to be similarly affected. With additional investigation, a more homogenized field of hypofractionated radiation exposure may allow for tumor obliteration with relative preservation of critical anatomical structures.",Excluded

2788,"Post-Fukushima radiation education for Japanese high school students in affected areas and its positive effects on their radiation literacy. In post-Fukushima Japan, radiation education is very important, and the subject is being actively discussed. However, little information is available about the amount of knowledge students initially had about radiation or about how well radiation education improves their understanding. Using the questionnaire results of 717 students completed before and after radiation lectures held in three high schools in Fukushima, we examined the number of answers to the questionnaire aligned with the evidence base, and classified the students into clusters based on radiation-related behavior and attitudes to assess the effectiveness of the lecture. The contents of the lectures consisted of (i) scientific knowledge relating to radiation, (ii) results of radiation examinations conducted locally following the disaster and (iii) measures and precautions for daily radiation protection. Associations between the type of knowledge and radiation-related behavior and attitude were also examined to determine which type of knowledge was more important for deepening students' understanding of radiation. This study revealed that radiation education in high schools was effective for students with respect to acquiring relevant basic and practical knowledge; however, the effects of the radiation lecture differed greatly between schools, presumably due to differences in the delivery and atmosphere of the lecture. The present study also suggested that radiation education may positively transform student attitudes and behaviors related to radiation. To enable such a change in awareness, the acquisition of scientific knowledge is essential, for it enables individuals to make better decisions about important matters in their daily lives.",Excluded

It has been reported that decreasing the surface dose reduces patient morbidity, especially facial weakness and numbness. The authors of this retrospective study examine patient data from a single center to determine if low-dose ( 14 Gy). METHOD(S): Based on the formula for ellipsoid volumes, the tumor volumes were calculated using measurements from MR images obtained at follow up in patients treated at the authors' center. Follow-up data were available in 159 patients with a mean age of 59.5 +/- 14.2 years at treatment. Fifty-six percent of the patients were women and 53.5% of the tumors were located on the right side of the brain. The mean tumor volume was 3.3 +/- 4.3 cm3 with 10% of the tumors having volumes larger than 8 cm3. After GKS, smaller tumors (> or = 40% decrease in volume) were observed in 44.8% of patients treated with a low dose and in 48.8% treated with a high dose. Enlarged tumors (> or = 40% increase in volume) were seen in 5.2% of the patients receiving a low dose and 2.3% of those receiving a high dose. These differences were not statistically significant. Patients who had been followed up for longer than 5 years after treatment had median residual volumes of only 28.2% of the starting volume in the low-dose group and 26% in the high-dose group.

3271,"A randomized study comparing the use of a pelvic lead shield during trans-radial interventions: Threefold decrease in radiation to the operator but double exposure to the patient. OBJECTIVES: To determine the efficacy of a 0.5-mm lead apron across the patient's abdomen in addition to standard operator protection for the reduction of scatter radiation on operator and patient radiation exposure, BACKGROUND: Cardiac angiography using the radial access compared to the femoral approach is associated with reduced complication rate and improved patient comfort but has significantly increased radiation dose. Improvements in radiation protection are needed, METHODS: We randomly assigned 332 patients undergoing coronary angiography to a group with pelvic lead shielding and a group with standard protection. In each procedure, eight digital dosimeters were used to measure operator radiation dose [under the lead apron, outside the thyroid shield, and at the left side of the head], patient dose at the level of the umbilicus [above and beneath the lead apron], and two on the acrylic shielding and one on the image receptor to measure scattered radiation, RESULTS: Both groups were similar in BMI, procedures performed, and number of sequences. Usage of lead shielding statistically significantly reduced the radiation dose of the operator at all three sites measured: under lead apron [all in microSv]: 0.53 +/- 1.4 vs. 0.17 +/- 0.6, on thyroid collar 5.9 +/- 7.7 vs. 2.9 +/- 3.4, and left side of head 3.3 +/- 3.4 vs. 2.1 +/- 2.2, P<0.001.

METHOD(S): Electronic case report forms (eCRF) were fielded to assess clinical response to systemic therapy in a rare malignancy. A comparison of subjectively reported best response with radio-graphic measurements of target lesions was performed to assess responses. RESULT(S): Fifteen physicians with experience treating this malignancy participated in a CRF-based analysis of patterns of care. Treatment response for each line of therapy was collected for each of the 59 patients via CRF. For 9 patients (15%) with reported partial remission (PR), CRFs were augmented with bi-dimensional measurements of sentinel tumors from pre-treatment and best response radiographs (reports). Treatment response was calculated using sum of diameters according to RECIST and compared to the corresponding physician-reported response. Measurement-based response revealed 4 PR, 2 stable disease, and 3 progressive disease, and a concordance of 44.4% (95% CI: 15.3%, 77.4%) between response assessment methods. Reasons cited for variance include availability of previous scans for comparison, inconsistency in target lesions imaged, bone metastases difficult to follow, and use of diameter vs SUV (standardized uptake value) on positron emission topography (PET) scans. CONCLUSION(S): Subjective assessments of response collected via manual chart extraction, electronic medical record (EMR) review via natural language processing, or CRF may be problematic and limit the potential role of RWE in drug label expansion. The collection of target lesion measurements by CRF presents an attractive alternative to elevate the quality and accuracy of clinical response assessment in oncologic patients, but limitations exist.",Excluded
891,"Phase II study of cetuximab plus concomitant boost radiotherapy in Japanese patients with locally advanced squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck. Background: We investigated the tolerability of cetuximab plus radiotherapy in Japanese patients with untreated locally advanced squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck. Method(s): Patients with epidermal growth factor receptor-expressing locally advanced squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck received cetuximab (400 mg/m2 initial dose then 250 mg/m2 weekly) for 7 weeks plus concomitant boost radiotherapy (weeks 2-7: once daily [1.8 Gy] for 3.6 weeks, then twice daily [1.8 Gy morning and 1.5 Gy afternoon] for 2.4 weeks). The primary endpoint was treatment completion rate (the rate of treated patients completing >=70% of the planned cetuximab dose and the full dose of radiotherapy within 2 weeks over the planned schedule). Result(s): Twenty-two patients were evaluable. The treatment completion rate was 100% (95% confidence interval 85-100). The response rate 8 weeks post-radiotherapy was 82% (95% confidence interval 60-95). The most common grade 3/4 treatment-emergent adverse events were mucosal inflammation (73%); dermatitis (27%); and infection, radiation skin injury and stomatitis (23% each). Conclusion(s): Cetuximab plus concomitant boost radiotherapy can be safely administered to Japanese patients with locally advanced squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck. Tolerability and efficacy were in line with those reported in the Phase III Bonner trial in a Western population of patients with locally advanced squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck. © The Author 2013.

2256,"Effect of extracellular pH on GABA-activated current in rat recombinant receptors and thin hypothalamic slices. We studied the effects of extracellular pH (pHo) on gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)-mediated Cl- current in rat hypothalamic neurons and recombinant type-A GABA (GABA(A)) receptors stably expressed in human embryonic kidney cells (HEK 293), using whole cell and outside-out patch-clamp recordings. In alpha3beta2gamma2s receptors, acidic pH decreased, whereas alkaline pH increased the response to GABA in a reversible and concentration-dependent manner. Acidification shifted the GABA concentration-response curve to the right, significantly increasing the EC50 for GABA without appreciably changing the slope or maximal current induced by GABA. We obtained similar effects of pH in alpha1beta2gamma2 receptors and in GABA-activated currents recorded from thin hypothalamic brain slices. In outside-out patches recorded from alpha3beta2gamma2 recombinant receptors, membrane patches were exposed to 5 microM GABA at control (7.3), acidic (6.4), or alkaline (8.4) pH. GABA activated main and subconductance states of 24 and 16 pS, respectively, in alpha3beta2gamma2 receptors. Alkaline pH(o) increased channel opening frequency and decreased the duration of the long closed state, resulting in an increase in open probability (from 0.0801 +/- 0.015 in pH 7.3 to 0.138 +/- 0.02 in pH 8.4). Exposure of the channels to acidic pH(o) had the opposite effects on open probability (decreased to 0.006 +/- 0.0001). Taken together, our results indicate that the function of GABA(A) receptors is modulated by extracellular pH. The proton effect is similar in recombinant and native receptors and is dependent on GABA concentration. In addition, the effect appears to be independent of the alpha-subunit isoform, and is due to the ability of H+ to alter the frequency of channel opening. Our findings indicate that GABAergic signaling in the CNS may be significantly altered during conditions that increase or decrease pH.",Excluded
2939,"[ERCP procedures as a source of radiation risk to a single gastroenterologist]. BACKGROUND: One of the numerous sub-areas of interventional radiology is the use of X-rays in gastroenterology. X-ray fluoroscopy is applied in therapeutic procedures, including endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) that is frequently performed. The ERCP procedure is aimed at imaging the pancreatic duct and biliary tracts., MATERIAL AND METHODS: In this paper radiation risk to the gastrenterologist performing ERCP procedures was investigated. The procedures were performed by a single gastroenterologist in the ERCP Laboratory, University Clinical Hospital Military Memorial Medical Academy - Central Veterans' Hospital in Lodz, Poland. The study comprised 2 series of measurements, one taken during the procedures with continuous fluoroscopy mode, the other during procedures with fluoroscopy in pulsed mode at a frequency of 3 pulses/s. Exposure parameters, anatomical data of patient and dose equivalents for the eyes, skin of the hand and the effective dose for whole body of the gastroenterologist were recorded during each procedure., RESULTS: The collected data cover 70 ERCP procedures - 40 procedures were controlled by continuous fluoroscopy and 30 by pulsed fluoroscopy. The results reveal that pulsed fluoroscopy makes it possible to reduce doses received by the gastroeneterologist from 45% to 60% compared to continuous fluoroscopy., CONCLUSIONS: Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography procedures can cause radiation risk to the gastroenterologist performing them. The use of continuous fluoroscopy can result in achieving an equivalent dose to eye lens nearly 20 mSv per year, i.e., the decreased annual limit recommended by the International Commission on Radiological Protection (ICRP).

455,"Relationship between cone-beam CT technique and diagnostic usefulness in patients undergoing embolotherapy for hepatocellular carcinoma. Aim To determine the effect of different numbers of projection images in C-arm cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT) on diagnostic content and image quality in patients undergoing angiographic embolotherapy for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Materials and methods A total of 29 patients who underwent contrast-enhanced conventional multidetector CT (MDCT) within 6 weeks prior to CBCT acquired during embolotherapy for HCC between 2010 and 2013 were included in the study. CBCT was acquired in each patient using a 5-s (248 projection images) or 8-s (396 projection images) protocol. Anonymised images were reviewed independently by an interventional radiologist blinded to CBCT group. MDCT was used as a reference to the patient's anatomy, and performance of CBCT was compared to that of MDCT in each group. The level of concordance between CBCT and MDCT within each group was assessed for the following variables: number of foci >1 cm, largest tumour diameter, highest order branching vessel identified, image quality, diagnostic quality, signal-to-noise ratio, and contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR). CBCT radiation dose was recorded. Results There was no significant difference between MDCT and CBCT within each group in the number of tumour foci >1 cm identified or size of the largest focus measured. MDCT had superior image quality compared to both CBCT groups (p<0.01), but CBCT demonstrated subsegmental branches more often in each group than MDCT. Both CBCT groups demonstrated higher CNR than MDCT (p<0.01). The dose-area product (3675+/-1295 versus 6598+/-1252 muGy.m2; p<0.001) and skin dose (119+/-41 versus 212+/-38 mGy; p<0.001) were significantly lower with 5-s CBCT than with 8-s CBCT. Conclusion The relationship between MDCT and CBCT in both groups was consistent. The information obtained with 5-s CBCT was equivalent to that obtained with 8-s CBCT but with a lower radiation dose.Copyright © 2017 The Royal College of Radiologists",Excluded
2665,"Establishment of national diagnostic reference levels for radiotherapy computed tomography simulation procedures in Slovenia. PURPOSE: To propose national diagnostic reference levels (DRLs) for radiotherapy (RT) computed tomography (CT) localization purposes, compare both CT units used in the largest RT department in the country and to compare gathered results with other published DRLs in order to discover any need of optimization., METHODS: In total, 1631 patient data (time spend of 4 months) regarding sex, examination type, total dose-length product (DLP) and CTDIvol was collated on two CT units. Those simulation procedures account for more than 80 % of all simulation procedures performed nationwide. Then, total DLP and CTDIvol was calculated and mean, median and 3rd quartile for both units together were presented to determine national DRLs for simulation procedures. The same data was later compared between both units to discover any potential need for optimization., RESULTS: 3rd quartile values of DLP for abdomen, breast, chest, head, head and neck, pelvis and spine were 1116.2, 606.6, 832.4, 1942.4, 969.2, 677.1 and 1042.4 mGy.cm, respectively. 3rd quartile CTDIvol values for the same sequence of procedures were 18.7, 13.3, 19.2, 76.9, 22.6, 17.9 and 22.2mGy, respectively. Among the two units, the mentioned dose values were on average significantly higher on one CT unit than on the other unit., CONCLUSIONS: When comparing collected dose values with other studies, RT CT DRLs showed that radiation doses from our institution were similar or even lower. Some variations were found between both CT units in certain protocols, so exposure parameters should be reviewed and optimized. Copyright © 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",Excluded
3158,"Low sensitivity of the sister chromatid exchange assay to detect the genotoxic effects of radioiodine therapy. To assess the genotoxic risk associated with 131I therapy, sister chromatid exchanges (SCEs) and cells with unusually high SCE counts (HFC) were determined in a follow-up study performed with 46 hyperthyroidism and 39 thyroid cancer patients treated with 131I. In addition, a crosssectional study was also carried out with 78 control persons and 51 thyroid cancer patients that had completed radioiodine therapy from 1 to 6 years prior to the current investigation. In the follow-up analysis, the study was conducted over time and four blood samples were drawn from each patient: the first one prior to the radioiodine treatment, with the remaining three taken sequentially over the year after therapy. Concerning the results obtained for the whole population in the follow-up study, the SCE and HFC values found after radioiodine therapy did not show any significant increase, neither in the hyperthyroidism nor thyroid cancer groups. Unlike the results mentioned above, when the effect of smoking habit was considered, there was a slight but significant increase in SCE in the samples taken 3 months and 1 week after 131I therapy in the hyperthyroidism and thyroid cancer non-smokers, respectively. The data obtained in the cross-sectional study did not show differences in SCE and HFC between the control group and the cancer group treated with 131I. It is noteworthy that among the different parameters analysed, smoking habit is the only factor that showed a direct relationship with SCE and HFC and, as a consequence, smokers had significantly more SCE and HFC than nonsmokers. Taking into account our previous investigations showing a highly significant increase in the frequency of micronuclei for the same patients and sampling times, the outcomes obtained would suggest that the eventual genotoxic effect of 131I therapy could not be dearly detected by the SCE assay. This would reinforce the view that ionizing radiation appears to be a poor inducer of SCEs.",Excluded

Background: This study is conducted to investigate and compare image quality and radiation dose between prospective ECG-triggered and retrospective ECG-gated coronary CT angiography (CCTA) with the use of single-source CT (SSCT) and dual-source CT (DSCT). Method(s): A total of 209 patients who underwent CCTA with suspected coronary artery disease scanned with SSCT (n=95) and DSCT (n=114) scanners using prospective ECG-triggered and retrospective ECG-gated protocols were recruited from two institutions. The image was assessed by two experienced observers, while quantitative assessment was performed by measuring the image noise, the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and the contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR). Effective dose was calculated using the latest published conversion coefficient factor. Result(s): A total of 2087 out of 2880 coronary artery segments were assessable, with 98.0% classified as of sufficient and 2.0% as of insufficient image quality for clinical diagnosis. There was no significant difference in overall image quality between prospective ECG-triggered and retrospective gated protocols, whether it was performed with DSCT or SSCT scanners. Prospective ECG-triggered protocol was compared in terms of radiation dose calculation between DSCT (6.5+/-2.9 mSv) and SSCT (6.2+/-1.0 mSv) scanners and no significant difference was noted (p=0.99). However, the effective dose was significantly lower with DSCT (18.2+/-8.3 mSv) than with SSCT (28.3+/-7.0 mSv) in the retrospective gated protocol. Conclusion(s): Prospective ECG-triggered CCTA reduces radiation dose significantly compared to retrospective ECG-gated CCTA, while maintaining good image quality. © 2012 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

The aim of this Phase I clinical trial was to assess the feasibility and safety of capecitabine-based preoperative chemoradiotherapy (CRT) combined with bevacizumab and to determine the optimal capecitabine dose for Japanese patients with locally advanced rectal cancer. Patients with cT3/T4 rectal cancer were eligible. Bevacizumab was administered at 5 mg/kg intravenously on Days 1, 15 and 29. Capecitabine was administered on weekdays concurrently with pelvic radiotherapy at a daily dose of 1.8 Gy, totally to 50.4 Gy. Capecitabine was initiated at 825 mg/m(2) twice daily at Dose Level 1, with a planned escalation to 900 mg/m(2) twice daily at Dose Level 2. Within 6.1-10.3 (median, 9.4) weeks after the completion of the CRT, surgery was performed. Three patients were enrolled at each dose level. Regarding the CRT-related acute toxicities, all of the adverse events were limited to Grade 1. There was no Grade 2 or greater toxicity. No patient needed attenuation or interruption of bevacizumab, capecitabine or radiation. All of the patients received the scheduled dose of CRT. All of the patients underwent R0 resection. Two (33.3%) of the six patients had a pathological complete response, and five (83.3%) patients experienced downstaging. In total, three patients (50%) developed postoperative complications. One patient developed an intrapelvic abscess and healed with incisional drainage. The other two patients healed following conservative treatment. This regimen was safely performed as preoperative CRT for Japanese patients with locally advanced rectal cancer. The recommended capecitabine dose is 900 mg/m(2) twice daily.Copyright © The Author 2014.

2667,"Cardiac-CTand transoesophageal echocardiography comparison for left atrial appendage clots detection in patients referred for left atrial interventional procedures. Introduction: Left atrial appendage (LAA) was identified as a main location of clots formation (91% in non-valvular AF), and it is related with stroke and systemic embolic events. Presence of LAA clots is a contraindication to left atrial interventional procedures as pulmonary veins isolation or LAA percutaneous closure. Transoeophageal echocardiography (TEE) is the gold standard technique for exclude LAA clots, but other imaging modalities are emerging for this indication. Our aim was compare TEE and CT diagnostic performance for exclude LAA thrombus in patients referred for left atrium interventional procedure. Material(s) and Method(s): All patients studied with TEE (Philips EPIQ-7) and CT (Philips iCT-256) previous LAA percutaneous closure or pulmonary vein isolation procedures between May/2015 and May/2016 were included. LAA was studied with TTE in mid-esophageal views at 0degree, 45degree, 90degree, 135degree. LAA clot, spontaneous echo-contrast and low LAA velocities were assessed with TEE. CT was performed in two-phase scan (early arterial and venous phase with 70-90 sec delay), for detect filling defects in one or both phases. Result(s): 52 patients were included (67+/-15 years, 75% male). Main structural values were LV ejection fraction 57+/-11%, LA indexed volume 84 ml/m2, atrial fibrillation prevalence 46%. Procedure indication was 50% for LAA closure and 50% for pulmonary veins isolation. TEE detected 1.9% LAA clot (one patient), spontaneous echo-contrast 17,3% and low LAA velocities at 9.6%. Assessment with CT detected 1.9% LAA clot (1 case) and arterial defect at 17.3%. LAA clots cases are no coincident between both techniques (Pearson 0.02 p-value 0.889). Spontaneous echo-contrast was detected in 9 patients with TEE, 6 of them had arterial defect also at CT. On the other hand, arterial defect was detected at 9 with CT, 6 of them with spontaneous echo-contrast at TEE (Pearson 0.595 p-value <0.001). After comparison between indications there were differences in LAA defects prevalence. Previous LAA closure, TEE and CT detected thrombus at 3.8% (1 case) but are no coincident. TEE prevalence of spontaneous echo-contrast 30.8% and low flow velocity 19.2%; while with CT arterial defect 30.8% (Pearson 0.632 p-value 0-001). Previous pulmonary vein isolation TEE no detected any LAA defects and CT detected arterial defect but not at venous phase in one patient. Security data related with CT were 75 ml average of ionidated contrast (Visipaque 320mg), and a mean of radiation dose of 4.4 mSv. Conclusion(s): In our sample, LAA clots had a low prevalence. Both techniques detected a clot which it was no detected by the other modality. Instead, assessment of spontaneous echo-contrast or arterial defects had a moderate diagnostic correlation. A combined strategy with both techniques could improve the accuracy of LAA thrombus exclusion, especially in patients with LAA closure indication.",Excluded

This work deals with the assessment of personal exposure to radiofrequency electromagnetic fields and the study of temporal and spatial daily variations in a group of 24 adults from the West Bank, Palestine. Exposure was measured using a personal exposure meter EME SPY 140. Mean values of exposure levels from different radiofrequency sources were calculated using both naive and robust regression on order statistics approaches. The total daily exposure from all radiofrequency electromagnetic field sources varied widely among participants depending on their location, the mobile network they use, their activities, and their mode of transportation, ranging from about 0.2 V m to 0.9 V m. The average total daily exposure of all participants was about 0.48 V m. The main contribution to the mean exposure was from WiFi 2G (45%), GSM900 uplink (19%), GSM900 downlink, and FM radiobroadcasting (each by 11%). Other sources including GSM1800, UMTS2100, WiFi 5G, DECT, TETRA, WiMAX, and TV bands all together contributed 14%. During different activities, participants were exposed to the highest exposure level while traveling and to the lowest exposure while they were sleeping.

3322,"Non-contrast-enhanced preoperative assessment of lung perfusion inpatients with non-small-cell lung cancer using Fourier decompositionmagnetic resonance imaging. Objective: To investigate non-contrast-enhanced Fourier decomposition MRI (FD MRI) for assessment ofregional lung perfusion in patients with Non-Small-Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC) in comparison to dynamiccontrast-enhanced MRI (DCE MRI). Method(s): Time-resolved non-contrast-enhanced images of the lungs were acquired prospectively in 15patients using a 2D balanced steady-state free precession (b-SSFP) sequence. After non-rigid registrationof the native image data, perfusion-weighted images were calculated by separating periodic changes oflung proton density at the cardiac frequency using FD. DCE MRI subtraction datasets were acquired asstandard of reference. Both datasets were analyzed visually for perfusion defects. Then segmentationanalyses were performed to describe perfusion of pulmonary lobes semi-quantitatively as percent-ages of total lung perfusion. Overall FD MRI perfusion signal was compared to velocity-encoded flowmeasurements in the pulmonary trunk as an additional fully quantitative reference. Result(s): Image quality ratings of FD MRI were significantly inferior to those of DCE MRI (P < 0.0001).Sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of FD MRI for visual detection of perfusion defects were 84%, 92%,and 91%. Semi-quantitative evaluation of lobar perfusion provided high agreement between FD MRI andDCE MRI for both entire lungs and upper lobes, but less agreement in the lower parts of both lungs. FDperfusion signal showed high linear correlation with pulmonary arterial blood flow. Conclusion(s): FD MRI is a promising technique that allows for assessing regional lung perfusion in NSCLCpatients without contrast media or ionizing radiation. However, for being applied in clinical routine,image quality and robustness of the technique need to be further improved. © 2013 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.",Excluded

1354,"The human leulocyte test system. VII. Further investigations concerning micronucleus-derived premature chromosome condensation. Premature chromosome condensation (PCC) from X-ray induced micronuclei shows a dose-effect relationship in human leukocytes in vitro. Preparations at different culture times without colcemide treatment reveal complex variations of the frequencies of micronuclei and PCC correlated with the fixation time. The positions of PCC patches in the metaphase plate and the frequencies of different PCC types (S and G2) ar independent on the X-ray dose. The latter indicates that the slowing down of the micronuclei in the cell cycle, which is the reason for the formation of PCC, may be an outcome rather of a regulatory phenomenon than of an unspecific physiological damage of the chromatin included in the micronuclei. This is especially evident from labeling experiments with tritiated thymidine, showing that the extent of asynchrony between main nuclei and micronuclei is independent on the X-ray dose. Labeling experiments with tritiated uridine reveal a X-ray dose dependent suppression of RNA synthesis in cells with main nuclei and micronuclei. THE S-phase nature of ""pulverized"" PCC patches could be verified by incorporation of tritiated thymidine in aound 50%. Staining of centromeric heterochromatin in micronuclei reveal a frequency of micronuclei with centromeric heterochromatin resembling the frequency of G2-phase PCC found in mitoses.",Excluded
3330,"Late-onset radiation-induced optic neuropathy after radiotherapy for nasopharyngeal carcinoma. Radiation-induced optic neuropathy (RION) is a rare but devastating late complication of radiotherapy, usually manifesting months to years after cancer treatment of the head and neck, resulting in rapidly progressive blindness in one or both eyes. The incidence of radiation-induced complications following radiotherapy, especially RION, is correlated with survival time of patients. Nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC), the most common type of cancer in southern China, has been primarily treated with radiotherapy, with associated neural injuries. To our knowledge, there are few reports of RION among patients with NPC who have undergone radiotherapy. To study this further, we reviewed nine patients with NPC and RION after radiotherapy and examined the clinical manifestations of RION, characteristics of the ophthalmologic examination, MRI results and the treatments used. Of the nine patients with RION, the most frequent clinical presentation was a decline of vision with visual field defects in one or both eyes. Ophthalmologic examinations showed flame hemorrhages in the retina, optic nerve atrophy and cotton wool spots. T1-weighted enhanced MRI showed enhancement of the optic nerve and optic chiasm in six patients.

61,"Systematic evaluation of salivary gland damage following I-131 therapy in differentiated thyroid cancer patients by quantitative scintigraphy and clinical follow-up. Objectives Radioiodine therapy is a common adjunct to thyroidectomy in papillary thyroid cancer treatment. However, a variety of associated adverse effects have been reported. In this study, we assessed radioiodine-induced salivary gland dysfunction using quantitative scintigraphy, and evaluated the associated complications. Methods Patients were divided into five groups on the basis of the cumulative I-131 dosage received. Scintigraphic dynamic images of the salivary glands were obtained and converted into clinically relevant parameters: uptake index (UI), maximum secretion rate (%SR), and combined gland function scores. Patients were followed up for 3-66 months and interviewed for side effects including xerostomia, taste alteration, bitter taste, dental caries, xerophthalmia, and pain/swelling. Results An increase in I-131 doses resulted in a reduction in the UI and %SR and an increase in the combined scintigraphy score. Parotid glands were more affected than submandibular glands. A cumulative dosage of greater than 600 mCi resulted in complete loss of %SR in the parotid glands. No significant difference in either the UI or the %SR was observed between nontreated patients and patients receiving an I-131 dosage of up to 150 mCi. The occurrence of xerostomia was significantly correlated with the gland scintigraphic score, the number of treatment cycles, and I-131 dosage. The occurrence of pain and swelling was extremely low and only lasted for a short time. Conclusion Although the side effects associated with radioiodine treatment were apparent, they were usually small and temporary. Nevertheless, more consideration should be placed on careful dosing of I-131.Copyright © 2015 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc. All rights reserved.",Excluded
2024,"Impact of proton pump inhibitor treatment on gastrointestinal bleeding associated with non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug use among post-myocardial infarction patients taking antithrombotics: Nationwide study. Study question What is the effect of proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) on the risk of gastrointestinal bleeding in post-myocardial infarction patients taking antithrombotics and treated with non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs)? Methods This was a nationwide cohort study based on linked administrative registry data from all hospitals in Denmark between 1997 and 2011. The study included patients aged 30 years and over admitted with a first myocardial infarction who survived at least 30 days after discharge. The association between PPIs and risk of gastrointestinal bleeding according to NSAID plus antithrombotic therapy was estimated using adjusted time dependent Cox regression models. Study answer and limitations The use of PPIs was independently associated with decreased risk of gastrointestinal bleeding in postmyocardial infarction patients taking antithrombotics and treated with NSAIDs. Of 82 955 post-myocardial infarction patients (mean age 67.4 years, 64% (n=53 070) men), all of whom were taking single or dual antithrombotic therapy, 42.5% (n=35 233) filled at least one prescription for NSAIDs and 45.5% (n=37 771) received PPIs. Over a mean follow-up of 5.1 years, 3229 gastrointestinal bleeds occurred. The crude incidence rates of bleeding (events/100 person years) on NSAID plus antithrombotic therapy were 1.8 for patients taking PPIs and 2.1 for those not taking PPIs. The adjusted risk of bleeding was lower with PPI use (hazard ratio 0.72, 95% confidence interval 0.54 to 0.95) regardless of antithrombotic treatment regimen, type of NSAID, and type of PPI used. The main limitation of the study is its observational nonrandomised design. The results suggest that PPI treatment probably has a beneficial effect regardless of underlying gastrointestinal risk and that when NSAIDs cannot be avoided in post-myocardial infarction patients, physicians might prescribe a PPI as well. The study does not clarify whether PPIs might be safely omitted in specific subgroups of patients with a low risk of gastrointestinal bleeding. What this study adds In post-myocardial infarction patients, bleeding complications have been associated with both antithrombotic and NSAID treatment. Concurrent use of PPIs was independently associated with a decreased risk of gastrointestinal bleeding in postmyocardial infarction patients taking antithrombotics and NSAID, regardless of antithrombotic treatment regimen, type of NSAID, and type of PPI used.

983,"Diagnosing fish bone and chicken bone impactions in the emergency department setting: Measuring the system utility of the plain film screen. Objectives: In the emergency department, fish and chicken bone impactions are typically evaluated with screening x-rays. We sought to determine whether this modality ultimately improves system outcomes, including length of stay (LOS), cost, and radiation dosage. Method(s): We reviewed patients >=18 years old presenting to an urban academic emergency department over a 4-year period who received a screening soft-tissue x-ray to determine the presence of a retained fish or chicken bone. We calculated the diagnostic accuracy of x-ray and computed tomography (CT) evaluations, respectively, in addition to system outcomes. Result(s): Twenty-seven of the 78 patients included for analysis were ultimately positive for bone impaction. Initial x-ray interpretations demonstrated a sensitivity of 24.0% (95% CI, 9.4%-45.1%) and a specificity of 90.0% (95% CI, 78.2%-96.7%). However, initial CT interpretation (ie, a preliminary read from on-call residents) demonstrated a sensitivity of 75% (95% CI, 19.4%-99.4%) and a specificity of 100% (95% CI, 59.0%-100%). LOS, cost, and radiation dosage were not significantly different between patients who ultimately had true bone impactions and those who did not (P > .05). Conclusion(s): X-rays are poor screening tools in determining fish or chicken bone impactions with poor diagnostic and system utility. Further studies should be performed to evaluate the role of a low-radiation CT screen.Copyright © The Author(s) 2015.",Excluded
29,"Small Cell Lung Cancer. Methodology and Preliminary Results of the SMALL CELL Study. INTRODUCTION: Small cell lung cancer (SCLC) is the most aggressive histologic type of lung cancer, and accounts for approximately 10%-15% of all cases. Few studies have analyzed the effect of residential radon. Our aim is to determine the risk factors of SCLC., METHODS: We designed a multicenter, hospital-based case-control study with the participation of 11 hospitals in 4 autonomous communities., RESULTS: Results of the first 113 cases have been analyzed, 63 of which included residential radon measurements. Median age at diagnosis was 63 years; 11% of cases were younger than 50 years of age; 22% were women; 57% had extended disease; and 95% were smokers or former smokers. Median residential radon concentration was 128Bq/m3. Concentrations higher than 400Bq/m3 were found in 8% of cases. The only remarkable difference by gender was the percentage of never smokers, which was higher in women compared to men (P<.001). Radon concentration was higher in patients with stageIV disease (non-significant difference) and in individuals diagnosed at 63 years of age or older (P=.032)., CONCLUSIONS: A high percentage of SCLC cases are diagnosed early and there is a predominance of disseminated disease at diagnosis. Residential radon seems to play an important role on the onset of this disease, with some cases having very high indoor radon concentrations. Copyright © 2017 SEPAR.

1124,"Dose to larynx predicts for swallowing complications after intensity-modulated radiotherapy. PURPOSE: To evaluate early swallowing after intensity-modulated radiotherapy for head and neck squamous cell carcinoma and determine factors correlating with aspiration and/or stricture., METHODS AND MATERIALS: Consecutive patients treated with intensity-modulated radiotherapy with or without chemotherapy between September 2004 and August 2006 at the Dana Farber Cancer Institute/Brigham and Women's Hospital were evaluated with institutional review board approval. Patients underwent swallowing evaluation after completion of therapy; including video swallow studies. The clinical- and treatment-related variables were examined for correlation with aspiration or strictures, as well as doses to the larynx, pharyngeal constrictor muscles, and cervical esophagus. The correlation was assessed with logistic regression analysis., RESULTS: A total of 96 patients were evaluated. Their median age was 55 years, and 79 (82%) were men. The primary site of cancer was the oropharynx in 43, hypopharynx/larynx in 17, oral cavity in 13, nasopharynx in 11, maxillary sinus in 2, and unknown primary in 10. Of the 96 patients, 85% underwent definitive RT and 15% postoperative RT. Also, 28 patients underwent induction chemotherapy followed by concurrent chemotherapy, 59 received concurrent chemotherapy, and 9 patients underwent RT alone. The median follow-up was 10 months. Of the 96 patients, 31 (32%) had clinically significant aspiration and 36 (37%) developed a stricture. The radiation dose-volume metrics, including the volume of the larynx receiving >or=50 Gy (p = 0.04 and p = 0.03, respectively) and volume of the inferior constrictor receiving >or=50 Gy (p = 0.05 and p = 0.02, respectively) were significantly associated with both aspiration and stricture. The mean larynx dose correlated with aspiration (p = 0.003). Smoking history was the only clinical factor to correlate with stricture (p = 0.05) but not aspiration., CONCLUSION: Aspiration and stricture are common side effects after intensity-modulated radiotherapy for head-and-neck squamous cell carcinoma. The dose given to the larynx and inferior constrictors correlated with these side effects.",Excluded

1992,"Does ultra-low-dose CT with a radiation dose equivalent to that of KUB suffice to detect renal and ureteral calculi?. The objective of this study was to evaluate the diagnostic yield of multislice CT using a radiation dose equivalent to that of conventional abdominal x-ray (KUB). One hundred forty-two patients were prospectively examined with ultrasound and a radically dose-reduced CT protocol (120 kV, 6.9 eff. mAs). Number and size of calculi, presence of urinary obstruction, and alternative diagnoses were recorded and confirmed by stone removal/discharge or by clinical and imaging follow-up. The mean effective whole-body dose was 0.5 mSv in men and 0.7 mSv in women. The sensitivity and specificity in detecting patients with calculi was 97% and 95% for CT and 67% and 90% for ultrasound. Urinary obstruction was similarly assessed, whereas CT identified significantly more alternative diagnoses than ultrasound (P < 0.001). With regard to published data for standard-dose CT, the present CT protocol seems to be comparable in its diagnostic yield in assessing patients with calculi, and its radiation dose is equivalent to that of KUB.

OBJECTIVE: To examine biochemical control, survival, and late morbidity with definitive low-dose-rate brachytherapy (LDR-BT) for patients with prostate cancer surviving for >10 years after treatment., PATIENTS AND METHODS: We identified 757 men with localised prostate cancer who underwent definitive LDR-BT in the period 1990-2006 and were followed for >10 years at our institution. Biochemical failure-free survival (BFFS), distant metastases-free survival (DMFS), prostate cancer-specific survival (PCSS), and overall survival (OS) were selected as study endpoints. Survival was examined using the log-rank test, Kaplan-Meier method, and Cox regression modelling. Urinary, quality of life (QoL), and potency scores at baseline and last follow-up were recorded., RESULTS: The median follow-up was 12.5 years (range, 10.1-21.8 years). At the time of analysis, 88.6% of patients were alive, 1.5% died from prostate cancer and 13.9% developed biochemical failure, with 82% of failures occurring in the first decade of follow-up. Overall, 2.3% developed distant metastases. On multivariate analyses, stage T3a-T3b, prostate-specific antigen level of >20 ng/mL, intermediate- and high-risk disease predicted worse BFFS; whereas age >70 years at diagnosis and stage T3a-T3b predicted worse OS. A total biologically effective dose of >=150 Gy and androgen-deprivation therapy were associated with improved BFFS, but not OS. The overall 17-year rates for BFFS, DMFS, PCSS, and OS were 79, 97, 97, and 72%, respectively. Respective 17-year BFFS rates for low-, intermediate- and high-risk patients were 86, 80, and 65% (P < 0.001), whereas OS rates for the same groups were 82, 73, and 60%, respectively (P = 0.09). Amongst those patients who were potent at baseline, 25% remained potent at the last follow-up. Urinary function and QoL were mainly unaffected., CONCLUSIONS: LDR-BT yields excellent survival rates, with a 17-year PCSS rate of 97%. In all, 18% of patients with biochemical relapse failed at >10 years after implantation, which justifies their continued follow-up.

2388,"Quantitative Accuracy and Lesion Detectability of Low-Dose 18F-FDG PET for Lung Cancer Screening. Lung cancer remains responsible for more deaths worldwide than any other cancer, but recently there has been a significant shift in the clinical paradigm regarding the initial management of subjects at high risk for this disease. Low-dose CT has demonstrated significant improvements over planar x-ray screening for patient prognoses and is now performed in the United States. Specificity of this modality, however, is poor, and the additional information from PET has the potential to improve its accuracy. Routine screening requires consideration of the effective dose delivered to the patient, and this work investigates image quality of PET for low-dose conditions, in the context of lung lesion detectability. Reduced radiotracer doses were simulated by randomly discarding counts from clinical lung cancer scans acquired in list-mode. Bias and reproducibility of lesion activity values were relatively stable even at low total counts of around 5 million trues. Additionally, numeric observer models were developed and trained with the results of 2 physicians and 3 postdoctoral researchers with PET experience in a detection task; detection sensitivity of the observers was well correlated with lesion signal-to-noise ratio. The models were used prospectively to survey detectability of lung cancer lesions, and the findings suggested a lower limit around 10 million true counts for maximizing performance. Under the acquisition parameters used in this study, this translates to an effective patient dose of less than 0.4 mSv, potentially allowing a complete low-dose PET/CT lung screening scan to be obtained under 1 mSv.

Conventionally fractionated chemoradiation (CRT) or chemotherapy (CHT) are considered as standard options in locally advanced pancreatic cancer (LAPC) while stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) is an emerging treatment in this setting. The aim of this study was to compare two cohorts of LAPC patients treated with SBRT +/- CHT vs CRT +/- CHT in terms of local control (LC), distant metastases-free survival (DMFS), progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS), and toxicity. Eighty patients were included. Patients in the two cohorts were matched according to: age <=/>65 years, tumor diameter (two cut-offs: =3.0 and =3.9 cm), clinical tumor stage and clinical nodal stage, neoadjuvant CHT, and adjuvant CHT. Median prescribed total dose was 30.0 Gy (range: 18.0-37.5) and 54.0 Gy (18.0-63.0) in SBRT and CRT cohorts, respectively. Toxicity was evaluated by CTCAE v4.0 scale. Survival curves were calculated by Kaplan-Meier method. For hypothesis testing an equivalence and a non-inferiority test was calculated. No statistically significant differences in terms of acute and late toxicity, DMFS, PFS, and OS were recorded among the two cohorts. Median, 1-, and 2-year LC was: 16.0 months, 53.1%, and 40.5% in the CRT cohort and 22.0 months, 80.4%, and 49.8% in the SBRT cohort, respectively (P:.017). A statistically non-inferiority significance was recorded in terms of OS between CRT and SBRT (P =.031). Patients treated with SBRT showed higher LC rate and similar OS compared to CRT. Therefore, the design of confirmatory randomized studies comparing SBRT and CRT seems justified.Copyright © 2020 The Authors. Cancer Medicine published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd",Excluded
3608,"Physicians' Perceptions of Proton Pump Inhibitor Risks and Recommendations to Discontinue: A National Survey. OBJECTIVE: To provide contemporary estimates of internists' perceptions of adverse effects associated with proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) and self-reported clinical use., METHODS: We invited 799 internists, including specialists and postgraduate trainees, to complete an online survey. Topics included perceptions of PPI adverse effects (AEs) and effectiveness for upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB) prevention, changes in prescribing, and management recommendations for patients using PPIs for gastroesophageal reflux disease or UGIB prevention. We used logistic regression to identify factors associated with appropriate PPI continuation in the scenario of a patient at high risk for UGIB., RESULTS: Among 437 respondents (55% response rate), 10% were trainees and 72% specialized in general medicine, 70% were somewhat/very concerned about PPI AEs, and 76% had somewhat/very much changed their prescribing. A majority believed PPIs increase the risk for 6 of 12 AEs queried. Fifty-two percent perceived PPIs to be somewhat/very effective for UGIB prevention. In a gastroesophageal reflux disease scenario in which PPI can be safely discontinued, 86% appropriately recommended PPI discontinuation. However, in a high-risk UGIB prevention scenario in which long-term PPI use is recommended, 79% inappropriately recommended discontinuation. In this latter scenario, perceived effectiveness for bleeding prevention was strongly associated with continuing PPI (odds ratio 7.68, P < 0.001 for moderately; odds ratio 17.3, P < 0.001 for very effective). Other covariates, including concern about PPI AEs, had no significant association., DISCUSSION: Most internists believe PPIs cause multiple AEs and recommend discontinuation even in patients at high risk for UGIB. Future interventions should focus on ensuring that PPIs are prescribed appropriately according to individual risks and benefits.",Excluded

The study showed variations in the ESDs for chest examinations with five of the hospitals having values above the internationally recommended levels. ESDs for lumbar spine anterior-posterior and lateral projections were within acceptable limits. Diagnostic reference levels proposed by the International Commission on Radiological Protection based on patient dose data are imperative to the current Ghanaian situation and will lead to a reduction of the radiation dose.",Excluded
3314,"Individual variations in the micronucleus assay for biological dosimetry after high dose exposure. The micronucleus assay is widely used as a biological dosimeter. Due to an inhibitory effect of radiation on cell proliferation the assay yields satisfactory results only when the absorbed dose is below about 5Gy. In 2002 Muller and Rode suggested that a modified version of the test, based on the analysis of the ratio of trinucleated to tetranucleated cells and the frequency of micronuclei (Mn) in binucleated cells containing at least one Mn, can be applied to detect a dose reaching 15Gy (Mutat. Res. 502 (2002) 47-51). Their conclusion was based on the results of experiments with lymphocytes from one donor and nothing is known about the possible influence of individual variability on the applicability of the Mn test to detect high doses of radiation. The aim of the present study was to validate the modified micronucleus assay with lymphocytes of 5 donors. Their blood was exposed to 0, 5, 10, 15 and 20Gy of 60Co gamma rays. The levels of Mn and of cell proliferation were assessed using various approaches. A strong inter-individual variability was observed for all endpoints. The results clearly show that the assessment of cell proliferation is essential for the interpretation of results.

Although ~22% of the astronaut corps are women, most mechanistic studies use mostly male subjects, despite known sex differences in autonomic control and postflight orthostatic intolerance. We studied adrenergic, baroreflex, and autonomic indexes during continuous infusions of vasoactive drugs in men and women during a 60-day head-down bed rest. Volunteers were tested before bed rest (20 men and 10 women) and around day 30 (20 men and 10 women) and day 60 (16 men and 8 women) of bed rest. Three increasing doses of phenylephrine (PE) and sodium nitroprusside were infused for 10 min after an infusion of normal saline. A 20-min rest period separated the phenylephrine and sodium nitroprusside infusions. Autonomic activity was approximated by spectral indexes of heart rate and blood pressure variability, and baroreflex sensitivity was measured by the spontaneous baroreflex slope. Parasympathetic modulation and baroreflex sensitivity decreased with bed rest, with women experiencing a larger decrease in baroreflex sensitivity by day 30 than men. The sympathetic activation of men and parasympathetic responsiveness of women in blood pressure control during physiological stress were preserved throughout bed rest. During PE infusions, women experienced saturation of the R-R interval at high frequency, whereas men did not, revealing a sex difference in the parabolic relationship between high-frequency R-R interval, a measurement of respiratory sinus arrhythmia, and R-R interval. These sex differences in blood pressure control during simulated microgravity reveal the need to study sex differences in long-duration spaceflight to ensure the health and safety of the entire astronaut corps. © 2013 the American Physiological Society.",Excluded

Background KRAS mutation occurs in ~40% of locally advanced rectal cancers (LARCs). The multitarget tyrosine kinase inhibitor sorafenib has radiosensitising effects and might improve outcomes for standard preoperative chemoradiotherapy in patients with KRAS-mutated LARC. Methods Adult patients with KRAS-mutated T3/4 and/or N1/2M0 LARC were included in this phase I/II study. The phase I dose-escalation study of capecitabine plus sorafenib and radiotherapy was followed by a phase II study assessing efficacy and safety. Primary end-points were to: establish the maximum tolerated dose of the regimen in phase I; determine the pathologic complete response (pCR) rate in phase II defined as Dworak regression grade 3 and 4. Results Fifty-four patients were treated at 18 centres in Switzerland and Hungary; 40 patients were included in the single-arm phase II study. Recommended doses from phase I comprised radiotherapy (45 Gy in 25 fractions over 5 weeks) with capecitabine 825 mg/m2 twice daily x 33 plus sorafenib 400 mg/d. Median daily dose intensity in phase II was radiotherapy 100%, capecitabine 98.6%, and sorafenib 100%. The pCR rate (Dworak 3/4) was 60% (95% CI, 43.3-75.1%) by central independent pathologic review. Sphincter preservation was achieved in 89.5%, R0 resection in 94.7%, and downstaging in 81.6%. The most common grade 3 toxicities during phase II included diarrhoea (15.0%), skin toxicity outside radiotherapy field (12.5%), pain (7.5%), skin toxicity in radiotherapy field, proctitis, fatigue and cardiac ischaemia (each 5%). Conclusions Combining sorafenib and standard chemoradiotherapy with capecitabine is highly active in patients with KRAS-mutated LARC with acceptable toxicity and deserves further investigation. www.clinicaltrials.gov: NCT00869570.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Ltd",Excluded
312,"Stage i Lung SBRT Clinical Practice Patterns. Stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) has become increasingly utilized over the last decade in the treatment of inoperable stage I non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients, although no standardized dosing guidelines exist. In this retrospective study, we investigated the dose prescription pattern use in the United States for patients receiving SBRT. Method(s): Patients with stage I NSCLC treated with SBRT between 2004 and 2011 were identified within the National Cancer Database (NCDB). Trends in SBRT use and dose prescriptions were analyzed. Result(s): A total of 5246 patients met criteria as receiving SBRT. The overall mean and median BED 10 were 134.5 and 132 Gy, respectively. Of these patients, 94.5% were prescribed a regimen with a BED 10 >=100 Gy. The most common prescriptions overall were 60 Gy in 3 fractions (24.1%), 48 Gy in 4 fractions (17.8%), 50 Gy in 5 fractions (13.0%), and 54 Gy in 3 fractions (12.8%). Analysis of prescription trends revealed decreased utilization of 54 to 60 Gy in 3 fractions (47.9% in 2006 to 27.9% in 2011, combined) and increased utilization of 50 Gy in 5 fractions (3.1% in 2006 to 20.4% in 2011). Conclusion(s): Our findings suggest increasing use of SBRT over the last decade with a majority of patients being treated with regimens employing a BED 10 >=100 Gy. Since 2006, there has been a decline in the use of 54 to 60 Gy in 3 fractions, with an increase in the use of 50 Gy in 5 fractions.

Objectives: This prospective investigation was carried out in order to evaluate the accuracy of vertebral fracture assessment by DXA using GE iDXA device (GE Medical Systems Lunar, Madison, WI, USA) compared to conventional radiography. Materials/Methods: We enrolled 273 subjects (207 females and 68 males, age range 28-85 years) consecutively studied at our Mineral Metabolism Centre, which were undergoing a spine vertebral X-ray evaluation. Lateral images of the spine, from T4 to L4, by both conventional X-ray and iDXA device, were acquired in each subject on the same day, after informed consent was obtained. The radiographs were evaluated by an experienced skeletal radiologist (D.D.), using the semiquantitative (SQ) method. The iDXA images were evaluated by a trained operator using a specific software (enCORE). Result(s): By means of SQ radiological technique, we evaluated 3,515 (99%) of the 3,549 available vertebrae, and identified 151 vertebral deformities (101mild and 50moderate or severe). By means of iDXA we visualized 3,405 (96%) vertebrae and identified 150 vertebral deformities (100 mild and 50 moderate or severe). Ninety-two subjects (33.7% of the total sample) were identified as having vertebral fractures by SQ Rx technique and eighty-seven subjects (31.9%) fractured were recognized by iDXA (chi2 = n.s.). A single fracture was detected in 66 patients (24.2%) by conventional radiographs and in 59 subjects (21.6%) by iDXA; 26 subjects (9.5%) had multiple vertebral fractures detected by SQ Rx technique and 28 subjects (10.2%) by iDXA . Considering radiological SQ assessment as the gold standard, iDXA sensitivity was 87% and the specificity was 96% (Positive Predictive Value 88%; Negative Predictive Value 97%). Agreement between radio-graphs and iDXA was 96% with a kappa statistic of 0.91 (confidence interval 0.82-0.96). Conclusion(s): According to the results obtained, iDXA and SQ radiological technique demonstrated good agreement in classifying vertebrae as normal or deformed. Therefore, since iDXA performs spine images with good resolution and lower dose, it proves to be useful in the clinical evaluation of patients at risk of osteoporosis or for the selection of patients for osteoporosis-related clinical trials.",Excluded
289,"Rehabilitation program in secondary knee osteoarthritis with GENU recurvatum in hemi-paretic patients. Background It is known that the knee is divided into 3 compartments: medial, lateral and femuro-patelar. The medial compartment is more exposed to stress due to the knee biomechanics where the weight of load is in biggest proportion. The hemi-paretic patient supports modified forces in the knee-joint due to the muscle spasticity, fact which determines a redistribution of forces, so that through quadriceps failure and gastrocnemian muscle spasticity it would generate genu recurvatum, with modified biomechanics and redistributed areasof taking weight, making a vicious circle. Objectives We propose to prevent the formation of genu recurvatum at patients who suffered a stroke with hemi-paresis and reduce the changes at those who have already developed these modifications. Methods There were 26 patients selected for this study (14 women and 12 men, all over 45 years old) with a 2-year-old stroke, with secondary developed knee osteoarthritis at hemi-paretic lower limb. The patients were evaluated both through muscular and joint tests as well as knee front and profile X-rays. These patients were divided in 2 study groups. Both groups followed a rehabilitation program - physiotherapy, peripheral magnetic stimulation on the muscle motor points -18 days, when we followed the toning of the failing muscles to correct the knee muscle balance: quadriceps and tibialis anterioris muscles - to counteract the gastrocnemianus muscle spasticity, correcting position of genu recurvatum and ankle orthotic. The patients of the Study Group A followed this program while being hospitalized - 18 days, repeated and adjusted at 3 months. The patients of Study Group B of followed this program for 6 months with adjustedkineticprogram, the magnetic stimulation being applied 10 days/month. The evaluation was also initially made at 6 months with joint testing scale, and VAS pain scale, the 6MWD (6 Minute Walking Distance test), the WOMAC (Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Arthritis Index), and Ashworth spasticity testing scale (from 0 to 5). Results Group A did not obtain any improvement at the joint testing. The pain in the knee was reduced from 70.2 to 51.4 mm on VAS scale. The 6 MWD test made by moving with crutch recorded an average improvement of 15.6 m. The WOMAC scale recorded a score drop from 74.2 to 41.4. The Ashworth scale dropped from 3.5 to 3. Group B presented better results, a reduction of genu recurvatum observed and proved by the improvement with 5 degrees at the joint testing for extension. The VAS scale improved from 71.3 to 34.5. The 6 MWD test proved a growth in the walking capacity with 23.4 m. The WOMAC scale recorded a significant drop from 78.4 to 32.3, and Ashworth scale dropped from 3.6 to 2.7.

The aim of this study was to compare image quality characteristics from 64-slice high definition (HDCT) versus 64-slice standard definition CT (SDCT) for coronary stent imaging. In twenty-five stents of 14 patients, undergoing contrast-enhanced CCTA both on 64-slice SDCT (LightSpeedVCT, GE Healthcare) and HDCT (Discovery HD750, GE Healthcare), radiation dose, contrast, noise and stent characteristics were assessed. Two blinded observers graded stent image quality (score 1 = no, 2 = mild, 3 = moderate, and 4 = severe artefacts). All scans were reconstructed with increasing contributions of adaptive statistical iterative reconstruction (ASIR) blending (0, 20, 40, 60, 80 and 100 %). Image quality was significantly superior in HDCT versus SDCT (score 1.7 +/- 0.5 vs. 2.7 +/- 0.7; p < 0.05). Image noise was significantly higher in HDCT compared to SDCT irrespective of ASIR contributions (p < 0.05). Addition of 40 % ASIR or more reduced image noise significantly in both HDCT and SDCT. In HDCT in-stent luminal attenuation was significantly lower and mean measured in-stent luminal diameter was significantly larger (1.2 +/- 0.4 mm vs. 0.8 +/- 0.4 mm; p < 0.05) compared to SDCT. Radiation dose from HDCT was comparable to SDCT (1.8 +/- 0.7 mSv vs. 1.7 +/- 0.7 mSv; p = ns).

Cardiac computed tomography (CCT) might provide an added value, but limited diagnostic criteria are available. Method(s): TTE and prospective ECG-triggered CCT were performed in 17 patients with previously diagnosed LVNC and in 19 healthy controls (Fig 1) and segmental analysis was performed. In TTE, each segment was analysed in parasternal short axis view and maximal thickness of NC and C was measured in the segment with most prominent recesses/trabeculations during enddiastole and endsystole. In CCT maximal thickness of NC and C was measured in each segment during enddiastole (75% of R-R interval). Segmental CCT NC:C ratio was calculated and compared between LVNC and control. Spearman's correlation coefficient was calculated between TTE and CCT segmental ratios. Receiver operating characteristic curves were used to validate cut-off values for distinguishing LVNC from control on a per-segment and a per-patient basis. Result(s): The median [IQR] radiation dose for CCT was 1.3 [1.2-1.5]mSv. The CCT segmental median [IQR] thickness of the C layer was significantly lower in patients with LVNC compared to controls: inferolateral-midventricular (7.8 [6.8-9.8] vs 8.8 [7.8-9.5]mm), lateral- (6.2 [5.9-8.0] vs 8.3 [7.5-9.3] mm), inferior- (6.3 [5.7-6.7] vs 7.8 [6.9-8.4]mm), and septal-apical (6.9 [6.0-7.5] vs 7.9 [7.2-8.8] mm). The median CCT NC:C ratio differed between control and LVNC in the inferior-midventricular and in all apical segments (p< 0.05; Fig 2A). The infero-apical segment was that with most prominent recesses/trabeculations in both TTE (72%) and CCT (44%) (Fig 2B). NC:C ratio correlated significantly between CCT and TTE (both at enddiastole (=0.8) and endsystole (=0.9)). A CCT NC:C ratio of >1.7 distinguished LVNC with a sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value of 96, 99, 95, and 100% on segmental analysis (Fig 2C). Using this cut-off value, all LVNC patients could be identified (Fig 2D). Conclusion(s): LVNC can be diagnosed with ECG-triggered low-dose CCT using a NC:C ratio of 1.7 in enddiastole with an excellent accuracy. There is an excellent correlation between TTE and CCT NC:C ratio. (Figure Presented) .",Excluded
1253,"Differentiation between brain tumor recurrence and radiation injury using perfusion, diffusion-weighted imaging and MR spectroscopy. BACKGROUND: Differentiation between tumor recurrence/vital tumor tissue and radionecrosis based on conventional diagnostic imaging is impossible because of the likeness of the images. In such circumstances advanced MRI techniques (PWI, DWI, 1HMRS) seem to be helpful. The aim of our study was to evaluate the diagnostic effectiveness of PWI, DWI and 1HMRS in the differentiation of the tumor recurrence from radiation related injury., MATERIAL AND METHODS: The retrospective analysis comprised 11 contrast-enhancing lesions observed in 8 patients treated for gliomas with radiotherapy or radiochemotherapy. 5 out of 11 contrast-enhancing lesions were tumor recurrences whereas 6 out of 11 radiation-related injuries. The MR examinations comprised of conventional MR imaging (T1-SE, T1-MPRAGE with CE, T2-TSE, T2 FLAIR) and PWI, DWI, 1HMRS. Mean and maximum rCBV values of each contrast-enhancing lesion were calculated. These values were normalized to normal appearing white matter. Mean normalized ADC ratio to normal appearing white matter and mean ADC obtained from contrast-enhancing lesions were analysed. In 1HMRS only those voxels which were placed in solid part of the contrast-enhancing lesion were analysed and Cho/Cr, Cho/NAA ratios presented., RESULTS: Mean normalized rCBVmax (2.44 +/- 0.73 for tumor recurrence vs. 0.78 +/- 0.46 for radiation injury; p < 0.001) and mean normalized rCBVmean (1.46 +/- 0.49 for tumor recurrence vs. 0.49 +/- 0.38 for radiation injury; p < 0.005) were significantly higher in the recurrent gliomas group than in the radiation injury one. It was observed that normalized rCBVmax higher than 1.7 and normalized rCBVmean higher than 1.25 is highly indicative for recurrent glioma whereas normalized rCBVmax lower than 1.0 and normalized rCBVmean lower than 0.5 is highly indicative for radiation injury. Results obtained in DWI and 1HMRS were not statistically significant different between two analysed groups. Mean ADCce: 1.06 +/- 0.18 x 10-3 mm2/s for tumor recurrence vs. 1.13 +/- 0.13 x 10-3 mm2/s for radiation injury; p = 0.51. Mean normalized ADC: 1.55 +/- 0.39 x 10-3 mm2/s for tumor recurrence vs. 1.55 +/- 0.18 x 10-3 mm2/s for radiation injury; p = 0.98. Median Cho/Cr ratio: (2.16min/max [1.67-3.15] for tumor recurrence vs. 1.34min/max [1.13-2.37] for radiation injury; p = 0.15), median Cho/NAA ratio (1.9min/max [0.86-2.36] for tumor recurrence vs. 2.11min/max [0.97 vs. 2.87] for radiation injury; p = 0.51)., CONCLUSIONS: Among the analyzed advanced neuroimaging methods PWI seems to be most reliable in differentiation between tumor regrowth/recurrence and radiation necrosis. In these results mean rCBV is a better differing factor than max rCBV. Proton MR spectroscopy (1HMRS) and DWI do not differentiate analyzed groups with statistical significance, despite tendency to lower ADC values in recurrence group than in radiation injury one.",Excluded
1145,"Salvage Gamma Knife Radiosurgery after failed management of bilateral trigeminal neuralgia. Background: The incidence of bilateral trigeminal neuralgia (TN) is 1-6% of total number of TN cases. Gamma Knife Radiosurgery (GKRS) is effective in treating unilateral TN; however, outcomes of bilateral TN treated by GKRS have not been well evaluated. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the long-term GKRS outcomes of bilateral TN at our institution and compare with our published treatment outcomes of unilateral TN. Copyright:, Methods: Between 2000 and 2006, eight patients with bilateral TN were treated with GKRS. Data available on seven patients were collected. Facial pain outcomes were defined using the Barrow Neurological Institute pain intensity scale. Outcomes and toxicities were compared to published outcomes of unilateral TN patients treated with GKRS at our institution., Results: The incidence of bilateral TN in our series is 2.3%. Treatment outcomes were excellent in 5/14, good in 1/14, and poor in 8/14. Median follow-up time was 58 months. Median time-to-failure was 38 months. Pain control rate was 80% at 12 months and 65% at 36 months. Bothersome side effects were seen in 4/14 nerves treated. Compared with our long-term unilateral TN cohort, there was no statistically significant difference in outcome, time-to-failure, or rate of toxicity., Conclusion: Bilateral TN is rare, and effective treatment is crucial to improve the quality of life of those afflicted. Salvage GKRS is a reasonable treatment modality for individuals with bilateral TN.Copyright © 2014 Raval AB.",Excluded
2192,"HOPE for Rational Statin Allocation for Primary Prevention: A Coronary Artery Calcium Picture Is Worth 1000 Words. Allocation of statin therapy for the primary prevention of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) in borderline- and intermediate-risk patients has traditionally been based on population-based global risk assessment and other clinical and laboratory characteristics. Patient-specific treatment decisions are needed to provide maximal benefit and avoid unnecessary treatment. Guideline-based lipid management proposes that coronary artery calcium scoring is reasonable to implement in patients with a 10-year risk of 5.0% to 19.9% (borderline to intermediate risk) by using the pooled cohort equations when the decision about whether to initiate statin therapy is uncertain. We report data from both observational studies and a large primary prevention randomized controlled trial that support the position that this decision is, in fact, uncertain in about half of such patients because of risk misclassification. Such misclassification can be largely avoided by more widespread implementation of coronary calcium scoring, which helps to identify those with coronary artery calcium scores of 0, a finding associated with a less than 5.0% 10-year probability of an ASCVD event. Deferral of statin therapy in such patients, in the absence of smoking, diabetes, or a family history of premature ASCVD, provides more individualized and appropriate care and avoids the expense and potential adverse effects of statin therapy in those with low potential for absolute risk reduction. A rationale is also provided for the importance of coronary artery calcium scoring in women 50 years and older, possibly in place of 1 screening mammogram in women at least 55 years of age to avoid incremental radiation exposure, on the basis of the substantially higher lifetime risk of morbidity and mortality from ASCVD than from breast cancer. In patients with borderline or intermediate ASCVD risk, coronary artery calcium scoring should be used, whenever possible, as an aid to rational statin allocation for the primary prevention of ASCVD.

3645,"Striking regression of chronic radiotherapy damage in a clinical trial of combined pentoxifylline and tocopherol. PURPOSE: Radiation-induced fibrosis (RIF) remains the most morbid complication of radiotherapy because of the absence of spontaneous regression and the difficulty of patient management. RIF treatment with combined pentoxifylline (PTX) and tocopherol (Vit E) was prompted by recent advances in cellular and molecular biology that have improved researchers' understanding of radiation-induced late-injury mechanisms and by the excellent results from our previous human and animal studies., PATIENTS AND METHODS: Forty-three patients (mean [+/- SD] age, 59 +/- 10 years) presenting with 50 symptomatic RIF areas involving the skin and underlying tissues were treated from April 1995 to September 1997. Patients had had radiotherapy for head and neck or breast cancer a mean period of 8.5 +/- 6.5 years previously. RIF developed in the first year after irradiation and gradually worsened, without spontaneous regression. The mean measurable surface area of RIF ([S]) at the time of this study ([S(0)]) was 42 +/- 34 cm(2). The initial Subjective Objective Medical management and Analytic (SOMA) injury evaluation score was 13.2 +/- 5.9 and included evidence of edema, plexitis, restricted movement, and local inflammatory signs. A combination of PTX (800 mg/d) and Vit E (1,000 IU/d) was administered orally for at least 6 months., RESULTS: Treatment was well tolerated. All assessable injuries exhibited continuous clinical regression and functional improvement. Mean RIF surface area and SOMA scores improved significantly (P <.0001) at 3 months ([S(3)], -39%; [SOMA(3)], -22%), 6 months ([S(6)], -53%; [SOMA(6)], -35%), and 12 months ([S(12)], -66%; [SOMA(12)], -48%), and mean linear dimensions ([D]) diminished from the start of the study ([D(0)], 6.5 +/- 2.5 cm) to the end of treatment 12 months later ([D(12)], 4 +/- 2 cm). At the time of the treatment, we did not attempt to achieve the maximum effect, and the study was continued., CONCLUSION: The PTX-Vit E combination reversed human chronic radiotherapy damage and, because no other treatment is presently available for RIF, should be considered as a therapeutic measure.",Excluded
2727,"Local control in sinonasal malignant melanoma: Comparing conventional to hypofractionated radiotherapy. BACKGROUND: The purpose of this study was to analyze the effect of fractionation schedule on local control in postoperative radiotherapy (RT) for sinonasal malignant melanoma., METHODS: Sixty-three patients who were treated with surgery and postoperative RT in 4 accredited head and neck cancer centers in the Netherlands between 1998 and 2013 were retrospectively studied. Outcomes with conventional fractionation (2-2.4 Gy per fraction; n = 27) were compared to hypofractionation (4-6 Gy per fraction; n = 36). The primary endpoint was local control and the secondary endpoint was toxicity., RESULTS: Comparable local control rates were found after 2 and 5 years (63% vs 64% and 47% vs 53%; P = .73 for, respectively, conventional fractionation vs hypofractionation). Local recurrences were predominantly present ipsilateral (92%) and within the irradiated volume (88%). Late toxicity grade >= 3 was observed in 2 of 63 patients, 1 patient in both groups., CONCLUSION: Radiotherapy fractionation schedule did not influence the local control rate or the incidence of late toxicity in patients treated with surgery and RT for sinonasal malignant melanoma in this retrospective analysis. Due to this retrospective nature and the limited number of patients, strong recommendations cannot be made. Expected toxicity, patient convenience, and workload may be taken into account for the choice of fractionation schedule until conclusive evidence becomes available.

The Integrilin Washington Radiation for In-Stent Restenosis Trial (WRIST) aimed to study the impact of IIb/IIIa inhibitors as adjunct therapy to intracoronary radiation therapy (IRT) for patients with in-stent restenosis (ISR). The impact of GP IIb/IIIa inhibitor (eptifibatide) as adjunct therapy to vascular brachytherapy using (192)Ir emitter was examined in patients with in-stent restenosis. In the study, 150 patients were assigned to eptifibatide (Integrilin) and 150 patients to heparin only. Clinical composite endpoints at 30 days were similar between the patients treated with and without eptifibatide (4.7% vs. 4.0%; P = 0.78). There was a similarity in the non-Q-wave myocardial infarction (MI) rates between the eptifibatide and the control group. Major bleeding was similar in patients treated with and without eptifibatide.

1567,"Apoptosis, ageing and cancer susceptibility. We have previously shown that peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBL) from individuals carrying a germline TP53 mutation show a dramatically reduced apoptotic response to radiation. As part of a study of this phenomenon, we also investigated apoptotic response in a series of breast cancer patients lacking TP53 mutations and in a control group of individuals without cancer. There was a significant reduction in mean apoptotic response with increasing age in all groups. These findings are consistent with a number of studies in rodents, which have demonstrated a reduction in DNA damage-induced apoptosis with increasing age. In addition, after adjusting for age, breast cancer patients showed significantly reduced apoptotic responses compared with normal controls (P=0.002). The odds ratio for breast cancer in women with an apoptotic response of <35%, compared with women with a response of >49%, was 6.42 (95% CI 1.68-24.6). The data further support the hypothesis that a reduction in apoptotic response to DNA damage with increasing age may play a significant role in the age-related increase in cancer.",Excluded

Purpose: To investigate the efficacy and safety of concurrent stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) and ipilimumab or nivolumab in patients with untreated melanoma brain metastases. Patients and Methods: Eighty consecutive patients with 326 melanoma brain metastases receiving SRS in combination with ipilimumab or nivolumab were identified from an institutional database and retrospectively evaluated. Patients started systemic treatment with intravenous nivolumab or ipilimumab within one week of receiving SRS. Nivolumab was given at doses of 3 mg/kg every two weeks. Ipilimumab was administered up to four doses of 10 mg/kg, one every 3 weeks, then patients had a maintenance dose of 10 mg/kg every 12 weeks, until disease progression or inacceptable toxicity. Primary endpoint of the study was intracranial progression-free survival (PFS). Secondary endpoints were extracranial PFS, overall survival (OS), and neurological toxicity. Result(s): Eighty patients were analyzed. Forty-five patients received SRS and ipilimumab, and 35 patients received SRS and nivolumab. With a median follow-up of 15 months, the 6-month and 12-month intracranial PFS rates were 69% (95%CI,54-87%) and 42% (95%CI,24-65%) for patients receiving SRS and nivolumab and 48% (95%CI,34-64%) and 17% (95%CI,5-31%) for those treated with SRS and ipilimumab (p = 0.02), respectively. Extracranial PFS and OS were 37 and 78% in SRS and nivolumab group, respectively, and 17 and 68% in SRS and ipilimumab group, respectively, at 12 months. Sub-group analysis showed significantly better intracranial PFS for patients receiving multi-fraction SRS (3 x 9 Gy) compared to single-fraction SRS (70% versus 46% at 6 months, p = 0.01), especially in combination with nivolumab. Grade 3 treatment-related adverse events occurred in 11 (24%) patients treated with SRS and ipilimumab and 6 (17%) patients who received SRS and nivolumab. Radiation-induced brain necrosis (RN) occurred in 15% of patients. Conclusion(s): Concurrent SRS and ipilimumab or nivolumab show meaningful intracranial activity in patients with either asymptomatic and symptomatic melanoma brain metastases, although a subset of patients may develop symptomatic RN. The combination of nivolumab with SRS is associated with better intracranial control.Copyright © 2019 The Author(s).",Excluded

PURPOSE: This study was designed to evaluate the feasibility and efficacy of accelerated hyperfractionated thoracic radiotherapy concurrently combined with daily carboplatin in patients with locally advanced, unresectable nonsmall cell lung cancer., METHODS AND MATERIALS: Thirty-one patients with locally advanced nonsmall cell lung cancer were treated with continuous course, twice daily thoracic radiotherapy (1.5 Gy each) to a total of 60 Gy over 4 weeks. Carboplatin (25 mg/m2) i.v. was given immediately before each morning thoracic radiotherapy. Blood samples were taken to measure the blood free platinum pharmacokinetics on day 1., RESULTS: All 31 patients completed the protocol treatment without delay. The median age was 73 years, and the majority had Stage IIIA (32%) or IIIB (48%) disease. Major acute toxicity (> or = Grade 3) included 17 patients (55%) with leukopenia, 5 patients (16%) with thrombocytopenia, and 7 patients (23%) with esophagitis. One possible treatment-related death due to diffuse pneumonitis was observed. There were three complete responses (CRs) and 23 partial responses (PRs) in the radiation field, for a response rate of 84%. The relapse pattern was predominantly loco-regional, and the median survival time was 9.8 months. The area under the plasma level-time curve (AUC) of free platinum correlated significantly (r = -0.41, p = 0.04) with the surviving fraction of leukocytes, but not with the severity of the esophagitis. Responders had significantly (p = 0.04 by Welch's t-test) higher AUCs than nonresponders., CONCLUSIONS: This combination therapy was feasible and efficacious against locally advanced nonsmall cell lung cancer.

The goal of the study was to characterize the changes in neurovegetative control of the circulation, attending the presumed physiological and psychological stress originated by the isolation and confinement typical of the living condition of space stations, as simulated in a ground based unit, using time and frequency domain analysis. As a secondary goal we sought to verify the implementation of real time data acquisition, for off line spectral analysis of R-R interval, systolic arterial pressure (by Finapres) and respiration (by PVF2 piezoelectric sensors). We addressed the cardiorespiratory and neurovegetative responses to standardized, simple stressors (active standing, dynamic and static handgrip) on the EXEMSI 92 crew, before, during and after the isolation period. On average the appropriate excitatory responses (to stand, dynamic and static handgrip) were elicited also in isolation and confinement. Active standing and small masses muscular exercises are easy to be performed in a confined and isolated environment and provide a valuable tool for investigating the adaptational changes in neural control mechanisms.

Material(s) and Method(s): 131 patients were treated with SCRT (5 Gy/5 days), followed by surgery 3-53 days later. Break was calculated as the time interval between the end of irradiation to surgery and OTT as time interval from the beginning of RT to surgery. Result(s): Mean break was 21.5 (range 3-53.0) days and mean OTT was 26.5 (range 7-58.0) days. In univariate analysis, a break longer than 15 days and OTT >23 days were negative prognostic factors for OS for all patients, and particularly for the male patients' subgroup. RFS was non-significantly higher (P = 0.066) for patients treated with a break <=15 days and OTT <=23 days (P = 0.099), irrespectively of patients' sex. Patients treated with a break longer than 15 days and OTT >23 days had non-significantly lower level of MFS than those treated with a shorter break (P = 0.269) and OTT <=23 days (P = 0.498). Conclusion(s): In SCRT, a break in the treatment longer than 15 days, especially in the male patients subgroup, should be avoided, because it negatively affects patients' survival.Copyright © 2016 Greater Poland Cancer Centre.",Excluded

461,"Site-specific cancer incidence and mortality after cerebral angiography with radioactive thorotrast. Few opportunities exist to evaluate the carcinogenic effects of long-term internal exposure to alpha-particle-emitting radionuclides. Patients injected with Thorotrast (thorium-232) during radiographic procedures, beginning in the 1930s, provide one such valuable opportunity. We evaluated site-specific cancer incidence and mortality among an international cohort of 3,042 patients injected during cerebral angiography with either Thorotrast (n = 1,650) or a nonradioactive agent (n = 1,392) and who survived 2 or more years. Standardized incidence ratios (SIR) for Thorotrast and comparison patients (Denmark and Sweden) were estimated and relative risks (RR), adjusted for population, age and sex, were generated with multivariate statistical modeling. For U.S. patients, comparable procedures were used to estimate standardized mortality ratios (SMR) and RR, representing the first evaluation of long-term, site-specific cancer mortality in this group. Compared with nonexposed patients, significantly increased risks in Thorotrast patients were observed for all incident cancers combined (RR = 3.4, 95% CI 2.9-4.1, n = 480, Denmark and Sweden) and for cancer mortality (RR = 4.0, 95% CI 2.5-6.7, n = 114, U.S.). Approximately 335 incident cancers were above expectation, with large excesses seen for cancers of the liver, bile ducts and gallbladder (55% or 185 excess cancers) and leukemias other than CLL (8% or 26 excess cancers). The RR of all incident cancers increased with time since angiography (P < 0.001) and was threefold at 40 or more years; significant excesses (SIR = 4.0) persisted for 50 years. Increasing cumulative dose of radiation was associated with an increasing risk of all incident cancers taken together and with cancers of the liver, gallbladder, and peritoneum and other digestive sites; similar findings were observed for U.S. cancer mortality. A marginally significant dose response was observed for the incidence of pancreas cancer (P = 0.05) but not for lung cancer. Our study confirms the relationship between Thorotrast and increased cancer incidence at sites of Thorotrast deposition and suggests a possible association with pancreas cancer. After injection with >20 ml Thorotrast, the cumulative excess risk of cancer incidence remained elevated for up to 50 years and approached 97%. Caution is needed in interpreting the excess risks observed for site-specific cancers, however, because of the potential bias associated with the selection of cohort participants, noncomparability with respect to the internal or external comparison groups, and confounding by indication. Nonetheless, the substantial risks associated with liver cancer and leukemia indicate that unique and prolonged exposure to alpha-particle-emitting Thorotrast increased carcinogenic risks.",Excluded

In this study, we aim to retrospectively evaluate the effectiveness of computed tomography (CT)-guided percutaneous infiltration in a series of consecutive PS patients who have symptoms that are refractory to conservative therapies. An institutional database search identified 20 such consecutive patients who underwent infiltration with a mixture of long-acting corticosteroid and local anesthetic. Preoperational evaluation included physical examination and magnetic resonance imaging. The correct position of the 22-gauge spinal needle was verified with CT scan after contrast medium injection. Pain measured before the procedure and at 1 wk and 1, 6, and 12 mo after the procedure was compared by means of a numeric visual scale (NVS) questionnaire. The mean pain score before CT-guided percutaneous infiltration was 8.95 +/- 1.432 NVS units. This score was reduced to a mean value of 0.85 +/- 0.933 units at 1 wk, 0.90 +/- 0.852 at 1 mo, 1.10 +/- 1.165 at 6 mo, and 1.20 +/- 1.399 at 12 mo follow-up (p < 0.001). Two patients of 20 (10%) underwent a second infiltration that was performed at 7 and 10 d after the first, respectively. No complications were observed.

300,"Improvement of image quality at low-radiation dose and low-contrast material dose abdominal CT in patients with cirrhosis: Intraindividual comparison of low tube voltage with iterative reconstruction algorithm and standard tube voltage. OBJECTIVE: To intraindividually compare a low-tube voltage, low-contrast material dose computed tomography (CT) reconstructed with iterative reconstruction (IR) algorithm at standard tube voltage reconstructed with filtered back projection (FBP) and standard-contrast material dose during liver dynamic CT. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Twenty-five patients with liver cirrhosis underwent 64-section multidetector CT. One hundred twenty kilovolt (peak) (kV[p]) with standard contrast material dose of 600 mg of iodine per kilogram (protocol A) and 80 kV(p) with low-contrast material dose of 450 mg of iodine per kilogram (protocol B) CT image sets were reconstructed by using FBP algorithm and that of using IR algorithm with a 60%/40% blend of IR-FBP reconstruction at 80-kV(p) image set (protocol C). Scans obtained during 3 hepatic phases were subjected to quantitative and qualitative analysis. RESULT(S): The mean radiation dose and the contrast medium dose were significantly lower under protocols B and C than under protocol A. In all hepatic phases, all signal-to-noise and contrast-to-noise ratios were greater under protocol C than under other protocols at all anatomic sites. Qualitative analysis showed that image noise and diagnostic acceptability were significantly higher under protocol C. CONCLUSION(S): In all hepatic phases, a low-tube voltage, low-contrast material dose CT with IR algorithm yielded better contrast enhancement and image quality than a standard tube voltage, standard contrast material dose CT with FBP in thin adult patients.

Treatment of carcinoma of the prostate with female sex hormones causes not only impotence but also swollen, painfully mammary glands. The radiobiological response of the mammary glands renders it possible to prevent hormone induced gynecomastia by means of radiotherapy. On this indication, 121 patients treated with female sex hormones between 1961 and 1972 for carcinoma of the prostate were subjected to irradiation of both mammary glands. On 4 successive days, daily doses of 300 r surface dose were administered to each mammary gland, corresponding to a focal dose of 840 r at 3 cm tissue depth. The parameters were: roentgen radiation, 150 kV, 20 mA, 0.5 mm Cu, focus skin distance 40 cm, field size 6 x 6 m. 84 patients could be followed up more than 6 mth after the treatment. In 67 cases (79.8%), development of gynecomastia was completely suppressed, while in 16 cases, a slight degree of gynecomastia had occurred in spite of the irradiation. In one case, the gynecomastia that had already been completely developed at the time of the radiotherapy, had remained uninfluenced apart from a mitigation of the sensation of tension. In 6 of the patients who were free from gynecomastia (8.9%) the hormone treatment had been started prior to the radiotherapy. This proportion was considerably larger among the patients with mild gynecomastia, viz. 75% (12 cases). The lesser effect of the radiotherapy is considered to be correlated with the duration and dosage of the hormone treatment started prior to the radiotherapy, and may also be correlated with the duration of the interval between the end of the hormone treatment and the start of the irradiation.",Excluded
3235,"Utility of cone beam computed tomography verification after stereoscopic kV localization in head and neck tumors treated by stereotactic body radiation therapy. Purpose/Objective(s): Stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) for tumors of the head and neck is an emerging technique gaining popularity as literature regarding its efficacy and safety continues to grow. At our institution, we utilize an x-ray 6D image-guided radiation therapy system (combined infrared-based optical positioning and stereoscopic kV pair localization) for patient positioning followed by soft tissue verification with cone beam CT (CBCT). Here, we identify the magnitude of correction based on CBCT verification after stereoscopic kV pair localization for various anatomic sites of the head and neck and identify subsites in which planning target volume (PTV) margins may be reduced or CBCT may be eliminated. Materials/Methods: The retrospective record was reviewed for patients undergoing SBRT for head and neck tumors between the dates of 6/1/15 and 12/31/15. Patients who received intra-fraction image guidance by stereoscopic kV pair imaging followed by CBCT verification were identified. The magnitude and direction of applied shifts based on CBCT imaging in the vertical, longitudinal, and lateral directions were recorded, from which the vector magnitude of each shift in three dimensions was calculated. Result(s): Thirty-three patients were treated with SBRT for head and neck pathology in the 6-month time period, of which 19 received stereoscopic kV pair localization followed by CBCT verification. For each of the 69 treatments delivered by this method, the vector magnitude was calculated for each shift. The average of these magnitudes was 1.77 mm >=1.75 mm (mean >= standard deviation). For skull base and cervical spine treatments (n = 41), the mean isocenter shift was 1.53 mm >= 1.41 mm, compared to 2.12 mm >= 2.12 mm for non-skull base, non-spine head and neck treatments (n = 28). Conclusion(s): Shifts based on soft tissue localization by CBCT after positioning by stereoscopic kV imaging were typically less than 2 mm for the head and neck treatments in this series, particularly in those treatments directed towards the skull base or cervical spine. For head and neck tumors treated with SBRT near bony anatomy, CBCT verification may not be necessary after stereoscopic kV localization provided that an additional 2 mm margin is added to the PTV in quadrature.",Excluded
3013,"Microsatellite instability in B-cell lymphoma originating from Bloom syndrome. Bloom syndrome (BS) is a rare autosomal recessive genetic disorder characterized by lupus-like erythematous telangiectasias of the face, sun sensitivity, stunted growth infertility and immunodeficiency. In addition, BS patients are highly predisposed to cancers. Although recently the causative gene of BS (BLM) was identified as a DNA helicase homologue, the function of BLM in DNA replication has not been elucidated. In this study, p53 mutation and microsatellite instability in B-cell lymphomas originating from 2 sibling BS patients were investigated. In the originally developed tumor of both patients, no p53 mutation was detected. In one patient, however, after treatment by ionizing radiation the B-cell lymphoma recurred, showing a 9-bp deletion in exon 7. In lymphoma cells and an EB-virus-transformed cell line from BS lymphocytes of this patient, microsatellite instability was also detected from the reduced length of microsatellite DNA markers, although in the other patient microsatellite instability was not detected. Thus, 2 B-cell lymphomas, despite having the same BLM mutation, showed different phenotypes in terms of p53 mutation and microsatellite instability.",Excluded

OBJECTIVE: To explore the effect of bone cement distribution, cement leakage, and clinical outcomes with side-opening cannula for bone cement injection in percutaneous vertebroplasty (PVP) in treatment of Kummell disease., METHODS: A prospective study of patients with Kummell disease undergoing PVP was conducted from April 2012 to September 2017. In total, 43 patients (11 males, 32 females) with Kummell disease who received bilateral PVP were included in the study. The patients were divided into front-opening cannulas (FOC) group with front-opening cannulas and side-opening cannulas (SOC) group with side-opening cannulas. All patients were followed up for 6 months. The patient general information such as gender, age, bone density, compression ratio, operative time, and location of fracture vertebrae were recorded. Visual analogue scale (VAS), Oswestry Disability Index (ODI), bone cement distribution, radiation exposure time, bone cement leakage rate and vertebral height, and kyphosis angle were measured and compared for two groups before surgery, 1 day and 6 months after surgery., RESULTS: A total of 43 patients were enrolled, including 11 males and 32 females, aged 61-84 years. The bone density (T value) was 2.5 +/- 0.6 in FOC group and 2.4 +/- 0.6 in SOC group (P > 0.05). The compression ratio and operative time were 36.1% +/- 13.0%, 39.3 +/- 7.9 min in FOC group and 35.2% +/- 13.7%, 40.0 +/- 10.7 min in SOC group (P > 0.05). There was no significance between FOC and SOC groups in the location of fracture vertebrae. All patients underwent at least 6 months of follow-up. At 6 months postoperatively, the VAS and ODI were significantly higher in the FOC group (3.0 +/- 0.8, 35.7% +/- 2.1%) than in the SOC group (1.3 +/- 0.4, 18.6% +/- 2.4%) (P < 0.05). The cement leakage rate of the SOC group was 4.8%, which was lower than that of the FOC group (31.8%, P < 0.05), and the bone cement distribution ratio was higher than that of the FOC group (63.1% +/- 7.9% vs 40.5% +/- 8.6%, P < 0.05). At 6 months after operation, the height of the anterior and posterior vertebral bodies of the patients in the SOC group restored better than the FOC group (anterior SOC: FOC 5.1 +/- 0.5 mm vs 4.5 +/- 0.5 mm; posterior SOC: FOC 0.6 +/- 0.1 mm vs 0.3 +/- 0.1 mm, P < 0.05), and the kyphosis correction was more obvious than patients in FOC group (SOC: FOC 8.5degree +/- 1.4degree vs 4.6degree +/- 0.8degree, P < 0.05)., CONCLUSION: Percutaneous vertebroplasty with side-opening cannula is safe and effective in avoiding bone cement leakage, improving bone cement distribution, and restoring vertebral height.

98,"Flexible Modeling of the Association between Cumulative Exposure to Low-Dose Ionizing Radiation from Cardiac Procedures and Risk of Cancer in Adults with Congenital Heart Disease. Adults with congenital heart disease are increasingly being exposed to low-dose ionizing radiation (LDIR) from cardiac procedures. In a recent study, Cohen et al. (Circulation. 2018;137(13):1334-1345) reported an association between increased LDIR exposure and cancer incidence but did not explore temporal relationships. Yet, the impact of past exposures probably accumulates over years, and its strength may depend on the amount of time elapsed since exposure. Furthermore, LDIR procedures performed shortly before a cancer diagnosis may have been ordered because of early symptoms of cancer, raising concerns about reversal causality bias. To address these challenges, we combined flexible modeling of cumulative exposures with competing-risks methodology to estimate separate associations of time-varying LDIR exposure with cancer incidence and all-cause mortality. Among 24,833 patients from the Quebec Congenital Heart Disease Database, 602 had incident cancer and 500 died during a follow-up period of up to 15 years (1995-2010). Initial results suggested a strong association of cancer incidence with very recent LDIR exposures, likely reflecting reverse causality bias. When exposure was lagged by 2 years, an increased cumulative LDIR dose from the previous 2-6 years was associated with increased cancer incidence, with a stronger association for women. These results illustrate the importance of accurate modeling of temporal relationships between time-varying exposures and health outcomes.Copyright © 2019 The Author(s).

1362,"Use of preoperative lymphoscintigraphy and intraoperative gamma-probe detection for identification of the sentinel lymph node in patients with papillary thyroid carcinoma. AIMS: Lymph node metastases for papillary thyroid carcinoma are associated with an increased incidence of locoregional recurrence. The use of preoperative lymphoscintigraphy and intraoperative gamma probe detection to localize the sentinel lymph node in papillary thyroid carcinoma was investigated., METHODS: From February 2004 to December 2005 the sentinel lymph node technique was studied in 64 consecutive patients with cytological evidence of papillary thyroid carcinoma. The day before surgery, patients were submitted to US-guided peri-tumoural injection of the radiotracer and a lymphoscintigraphy was performed. In the operating room a total thyroidectomy was done, and thanks to a hand-held gamma probe the sentinel lymph node and all lymph nodes, belonging to the sentinel node compartment, were removed., RESULTS: The gamma probe identified the sentinel lymph node in 62 patients (96.8%). We found 48 (77.5%) sentinel lymph node without metastases; 12 (19.3%) with metastases and 2 (3.2%) with micrometastases. In 7 cases (11.3%), with a negative sentinel lymph node, metastases in other nodes of the same region were recorded. In 22 cases (34.3%) the ultrasound give an erroneous indication (P=0.004). Five patients (8.0%), 4 with multifocal cancer, had a positive postoperative lymphoscintigraphy., CONCLUSION: This study shows that the sentinel lymph node technique for papillary thyroid carcinoma is feasible, repeatable, and more accurate than preoperative ultrasound. In cases of multifocal thyroid lesions more patients should be enrolled to establish the utility of the radio-guided technique.",Excluded

2664,"Outcomes of stereotactic radiosurgery for foramen magnum meningiomas: an international multicenter study. OBJECTIVE Meningiomas are the most common benign extramedullary lesions of the foramen magnum; however, their optimal management remains undefined. Given their location, foramen magnum meningiomas (FMMs) can cause significant morbidity, and complete microsurgical removal can be challenging. Anterior and anterolateral FMMs carry greater risks with surgery, but they comprise the majority of these lesions. As an alternative to resection, stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) has been used to treat FMMs in small case series. To more clearly define the outcomes of SRS and to delineate a rational management paradigm for these lesions, the authors analyzed the safety and efficacy of SRS for FMM in an international multicenter trial. METHODS Seven medical centers participating in the International Gamma Knife Research Foundation (IGKRF) provided data for this retrospective cohort study. Patients who were treated with Gamma Knife radiosurgery and whose clinical and radiological follow-up was longer than 6 months were eligible for study inclusion. Data from pre- and post-SRS radiological and clinical evaluations were analyzed. Stereotactic radiosurgery treatment variables were recorded. RESULTS Fifty-seven patients (39 females and 18 males, with a median age of 64 years) met the study inclusion criteria. Thirty-two percent had undergone prior microsurgical resection. Patients most frequently presented with cranial neuropathy (39%), headache (35%), numbness (32%), and ataxia (30%). Median pre-SRS tumor volume was 2.9 cm3. Median SRS margin dose was 12.5 Gy (range 10-16 Gy). At the last follow-up after SRS, 49% of tumors were stable, 44% had regressed, and 7% had progressed. Progression-free survival rates at 5 and 10 years were each 92%. A greater margin dose was associated with a significantly increased likelihood of tumor regression, with 53% of tumors treated with > 12 Gy regressing. Fifty-two percent of symptomatic patients noted some clinical improvement. Adverse radiation effects were limited to hearing loss and numbness in 1 patient (2%). CONCLUSIONS Stereotactic radiosurgery for FMM frequently results in tumor control or tumor regression, as well as symptom improvement. Margin doses > 12 Gy were associated with increased rates of tumor regression. Stereotactic radiosurgery was generally safe and well tolerated. Given its risk-benefit profile, SRS may be particularly useful in the management of small- to moderate-volume anterior and anterolateral FMMs.",Excluded
2134,"Prognostic Factors Predict Oncological Outcome in Older Patients With Head and Neck Cancer Undergoing Chemoradiation Treatment. Purpose: Older patients with head and neck cancer (HNC) represent a challenging group, as frailty and comorbidities need to be considered. This study aimed to evaluate the efficacy and side effects of curative and palliative (chemo) radiation ([C]RT) with regard to basic geriatric screening in older patients. Method(s): This study included HNC patients aged >=70 years who were treated with curative or palliative (C)RT. Clinicopathological data including Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI), Karnofsky performance status (KPS), and treatment data were analyzed as predictors of overall survival (OS). Result(s): A total of 271 patients (median age, 74 years) were enrolled. The majority had UICC stage III/IV (90%) and underwent curative treatment (85.2%). A total of 144 (53.1%) patients received definitive and 87 (32.1%) had adjuvant (C)RT. Overall, 40 patients (14.8%) received palliative (C)RT. Median follow-up duration (curative setting) was 87 months, and the 2- and 5-year OS rates were 57.8 and 35.9%, respectively. Median OS was significantly different for age <=75 vs. >75 years, CCI <6 vs. >=6, KPS >=70 vs. <70%, Tx/T1/T2 vs. T3/T4, and adjuvant vs. definitive (C)RT, respectively. Age 70-75 years (p = 0.004), fewer comorbidities when CCI < 6 (p = 0.014), good KPS >= 70% (p = 0.001), and adjuvant (C)RT (p = 0.008) independently predicted longer survival. Palliative RT resulted in a median OS of 4 months. Conclusion(s): Older age, lower KPS, higher CCI, and definitive (C)RT are indicators of worse survival in older patients with HNC treated curatively. Without a comprehensive geriatric assessment in patients aged >75 years, the KPS and CCI can be useful tools to account for ""fitness, vulnerability or frailty"" to help in treatment decision-making.© Copyright © 2021 Stromberger, Yedikat, Coordes, Tinhofer, Kalinauskaite, Budach, Zschaeck, Raguse, Kofla, Heiland, Stsefanenka, Beck-Broichsitter, Dommerich, Senger and Beck.",Excluded

3140,"Skeletal muscle mass and sarcopenia can be determined with 1.5-T and 3-T neck MRI scans, in the event that no neck CT scan is performed. Objectives: Cross-sectional area (CSA) measurements of the neck musculature at the level of third cervical vertebra (C3) on CT scans are used to diagnose radiological sarcopenia, which is related to multiple adverse outcomes in head and neck cancer (HNC) patients. Alternatively, these assessments are performed with neck MRI, which has not been validated so far. For that, the objective was to evaluate whether skeletal muscle mass and sarcopenia can be assessed on neck MRI scans. Method(s): HNC patients were included between November 2014 and November 2018 from a prospective data-biobank. CSAs of the neck musculature at the C3 level were measured on CT (n = 125) and MRI neck scans (n = 92 on 1.5-T, n = 33 on 3-T). Measurements were converted into skeletal muscle index (SMI), and sarcopenia was defined (SMI < 43.2 cm2/m2). Pearson correlation coefficients, Bland-Altman plots, McNemar test, Cohen's kappa coefficients, and interclass correlation coefficients (ICCs) were estimated. Result(s): CT and MRI correlated highly on CSA and SMI (r = 0.958-0.998, p < 0.001). The Bland-Altman plots showed a nihil mean DELTASMI (- 0.13-0.44 cm2/m2). There was no significant difference between CT and MRI in diagnosing sarcopenia (McNemar, p = 0.5-1.0). Agreement on sarcopenia diagnosis was good with kappa = 0.956-0.978 and kappa = 0.870-0.933, for 1.5-T and 3-T respectively. Observer ICCs in MRI were excellent. In general, T2-weighted images had the best correlation and agreement with CT. Conclusion(s): Skeletal muscle mass and sarcopenia can interchangeably be assessed on CT and 1.5-T and 3-T MRI neck scans. This allows future clinical outcome assessment during treatment irrespective of used modality. Key Points: * Screening for low amount of skeletal muscle mass is usually measured on neck CT scans and is highly clinical relevant as it is related to multiple adverse outcomes in head and neck cancer patients. * We found that skeletal muscle mass and sarcopenia determined on CT and 1.5-T and 3-T MRI neck scans at the C3 level can be used interchangeably. * When CT imaging of the neck is missing for skeletal muscle mass analysis, patients can be assessed with 1.5-T or 3-T neck MRIs.Copyright © 2020, The Author(s).",Excluded
1138,"Spinal alignment during motion and its relation to balance control in adult spinal deformity. Hypothesis: Dynamic spinal alignment in adult spinal deformity differs from controls and relates to balance control. Introduction: Adult spinal deformity (ASD) patients show decreased function in terms of balance control. Surprisingly this decrease did so far not show any relation with 2D static spinopelvic parameters. (1) This study explores if instead a relation exists between balance and dynamic spinal alignment, using an innovative method to assess 2D spinal parameters during dynamic conditions. Method(s): 12 sagittal ASD patients and 12 controls performed a sit-tostand (STS) task in a motion lab. 12 markers were placed on the spinous process of C7, T1, T3, T5, T7, T9, T11, T12, L2, L3, L4 and S2. To link the markers to the true anatomy of the subject the markers were corrected to the 3D positions of the vertebral bodies based on biplanar X-rays. Then a 3rd order polynomial (2) was fitted through the markers' 3D trajectories. Angles were defined by the normals through the markers (Fig 1. Ab) on the polynomial's tangents (Fig 1 Aa). Dynamic thoracic kyphosis (TK) and lumbar lordosis (LL) were measured from T1-T12 and T12-S2. Dynamic sagittal vertical axis (SVA) was defined by the distance between the S2 marker and the projection of the C7 marker on the S2 transverse plane. A Statistical Parametric Mapping (SPM) unpaired t test was used to compare timenormalized dynamic spinal parameters. Balance control was assessed using the Balance Evaluation Systems Test (BESTest). To explore the relation between spinal motion and balance control SPM regression analysis was performed. Result(s): LL was significantly lower during STS in ASD patients (27-100% of STS cycle) with a clearly decreasing LL from 27 to 50%, which is not observed in control subjects. A significant relation between LL and BESTest (max r = 0.64 at 50% of the motion curve; p = 0.004) revealed that the use of more LL during STS was associated with better balance performance measured with the BESTest. No differences were found between ASD patients and controls for TK and SVA motion curves. Conclusion(s): ASD patients use more lumbar flexion during STS indicated by a decrease in lumbar lordosis, compared to controls who increase their lordosis through the whole movement suggesting the use of pelvic anteversion. Decreased dynamic lumbar lordosis might be an underlying mechanism of decreased functionality in ASD, since it shows a significant relation with balance control. (1) Moke et al.

2673,"Prevalence and characteristics of coronary artery anomalies detected by coronary computed tomography angiography in 5 634 consecutive patients in a single centre in Switzerland. STUDY PRINCIPLES: Coronary computed tomography angiography (CCTA) allows three-dimensional visualisation of the origin, course and ending of the coronary vessels with high spatial resolution, yielding an accurate depiction of coronary artery anomalies (CAAs). This study sought to determine the prevalence, incidence and characteristics of CAAs detected with CCTA in a single centre in Switzerland., METHODS: CAAs were retrospectively identified in 5 634 consecutive patients referred for CCTA between March 2007 and July 2015. Single coronary arteries, Bland-White-Garland syndrome, anomalous coronary arteries originating from the opposite site of the sinus of Valsalva (ACAOS) with an interarterial course and coronary artery fistulas were classified as potentially malignant CAAs., RESULTS: We identified 145 patients with CAAs, resulting in an overall prevalence of 2.6% and cumulative incidence of 2.1% in all patients referred for CCTA in the observation period. Forty-nine (33.8%) patients showed malignant CAAs including 1 (0.7%) patient with Bland-White-Garland syndrome, 7 (4.8%) with single coronary arteries, 36 (24.8%) with ACAOS and an interarterial course, and 5 (3.5%) with coronary artery fistulas. The remaining 96 (66.2%) patients were classified as having benign variants., CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of CAA detected by CCTA is not negligible. Because of its noninvasive nature, relatively low cost and low radiation exposure, a further increase in the utilisation of CCTA may be expected, which may consequently be paralleled by an increasing absolute number of incidentally detected CAAs. Hence, awareness of the main issues and possible management strategies regarding CAAs is of importance for every treating physician.",Excluded

UNLABELLED: Clinical trials are increasingly investigating the effects of intracoronary radiation for the treatment of de-novo lesions, restenosis (without stents), and in-stent restenosis. As the first group in Germany, we had the opportunity to use the Novoste system within the international multicenter studies BETA-CATH, START and BRIE and report our preliminary experience regarding safety and feasibility of intracoronary brachytherapy with this afterloader. A total of 95 patients were enrolled. The Novoste system was used in 92 patients (104 lesions). Ischemic complications were not observed; therefore, radiation was performed as planned. The mean applied dose was 16 +/- 2 Gy (14-20 Gy, at 2 mm distance) and mean exposure time was 202 +/- 27 s (165-261 s). The addition of brachytherapy increased the total duration of the intervention for 17 +/- 8 min. At the body surface of the patients, the following dose rates were measured: left chest wall: 99 +/- 52 microSv/h; groin 3 +/- 3 microSv/h. All patients received ASS 300 mg/d o.d. Patients with stent implantation in the same session received 250 mg b.i.d. Ticlopidin or 75 mg Clopidogrel o.d. for at least three months. Total mortality and infarct rate was 0. There was no acute, subacute or late stent thrombosis., CONCLUSION: Our first experience with the Novoste Beta-Cath system showed that intracoronary brachytherapy can be safely and simply performed in the cath lab. There were no acute complications. To avoid the possible risk of late stent thrombosis, Ticlopidin or Clopidogrel must be administered for at least three months.",Excluded

1853,"Knee medial and lateral contact forces in a musculoskeletal model with subject-specific contact point trajectories. Contact point (CP) trajectory is a crucial parameter in estimating medial/lateral tibio-femoral contact forces from the musculoskeletal (MSK) models. The objective of the present study was to develop a method to incorporate the subject-specific CP trajectories into the MSK model. Ten healthy subjects performed 45 s treadmill gait trials. The subject-specific CP trajectories were constructed on the tibia and femur as a function of extension-flexion using low-dose bi-plane X-ray images during a quasi-static squat. At each extension-flexion position, the tibia and femur CPs were superimposed in the three directions on the medial side, and in the anterior-posterior and proximal-distal directions on the lateral side to form the five kinematic constraints of the knee joint. The Lagrange multipliers associated to these constraints directly yielded the medial/lateral contact forces. The results from the personalized CP trajectory model were compared against the linear CP trajectory and sphere-on-plane CP trajectory models which were adapted from the commonly used MSK models. Changing the CP trajectory had a remarkable impact on the knee kinematics and changed the medial and lateral contact forces by 1.03 BW and 0.65 BW respectively, in certain subjects. The direction and magnitude of the medial/lateral contact force were highly variable among the subjects and the medial-lateral shift of the CPs alone could not determine the increase/decrease pattern of the contact forces. The suggested kinematic constraints are adaptable to the CP trajectories derived from a variety of joint models and those experimentally measured from the 3D imaging techniques.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Ltd",Excluded
3426,"Effects of parental radiation exposure on developmental instability in grasshoppers. Mutagenic and epigenetic effects of environmental stressors and their transgenerational consequences are of interest to evolutionary biologists because they can amplify natural genetic variation. We studied the effect of parental exposure to radioactive contamination on offspring development in lesser marsh grasshopper Chorthippus albomarginatus. We used a geometric morphometric approach to measure fluctuating asymmetry (FA), wing shape and wing size. We measured time to sexual maturity to check whether parental exposure to radiation influenced offspring developmental trajectory and tested effects of radiation on hatching success and parental fecundity. Wings were larger in early maturing individuals born to parents from high radiation sites compared to early maturing individuals from low radiation sites. As time to sexual maturity increased, wing size decreased but more sharply in individuals from high radiation sites. Radiation exposure did not significantly affect FA or shape in wings nor did it significantly affect hatching success and fecundity. Overall, parental radiation exposure can adversely affect offspring development and fitness depending on developmental trajectories although the cause of this effect remains unclear. We suggest more direct measures of fitness and the inclusion of replication in future studies to help further our understanding of the relationship between developmental instability, fitness and environmental stress.

Bone marrow biopsy was done on day -7 to estimate radiation dose and stem cells were reinfused when the radiation dose was estimated to be less than 5 cGy. The median 90Y-ibritumomab tiuxetan dose was 71.6 mCi (2649.2 MBq; range, 36.6-105 mCi; range, 1354.2-3885 MBq). Histology included follicular lymphoma (n = 12), diffuse large B-cell (n = 14), and mantle cell (n = 5). The median number of prior chemotherapy treatments was 2. The treatment was well tolerated. The median times to reach an absolute neutrophil count greater than 500/muL and platelet count more than 20 000/muL were 10 days and 12 days, respectively. There were 2 deaths and 5 relapses.

We describe a system for recording the electrical conductance of skin as a measure of sweat gland function., PATIENTS AND METHODS: In 22 normal volunteers close agreement was obtained between measurements obtained from comparable sites on both sides of the chest. Measurements were subsequently made in 38 patients treated by radiotherapy to one side of the chest for tumours of the breast or lung using one of five different fractionation schedules. Simultaneous readings were obtained from both sides of the chest with the non irradiated side acting as a control., RESULTS: A dose response relationship was demonstrated: five patients who received the equivalent total dose of 15 Gy in 2-Gy fractions showed no change in conductance. Sixteen out of 23 who received an equivalent total dose of 42-46 Gy in 2-Gy fractions had a greater than 22% reduction in mean skin conductance compared with that of the control areas despite the skin appearing normal in the large majority. Marked changes in skin conductance were seen after higher total doses. In a prospective study 18 women receiving breast irradiation underwent weekly readings during treatment. A mean reduction of 40% in skin conductance was noted by the end of the second week of treatment prior to any clinical evidence of radiation change. Skin conductance returned to normal in 44% of patients by 6 months. In the remainder, those patients who showed the greatest reduction in skin conductance during treatment demonstrated the least recovery., CONCLUSIONS: Changes in sweat gland function can be detected and quantified in skin which may otherwise appear normal. Differences may so be demonstrated between areas treated using different fractionation schedules and the method may be applied to the detection during radiotherapy of unusually sensitive patient.",Excluded
1966,"Treatment of symptomatic atrial tachycardia in complex anatomic conditions: Use and outcome of ablation in patients after damus-kaye-stansel surgery. Background: Atrial tachycardias (AT) are amongst the most frequent complications in adult patients with congenital heart disease (ACHD). Their incidence mainly depends on age and complexity of underlying defect. AT has a marked impact on morbidity and mortality and is associated with sudden cardiac death particularly in complex ACHD patients. The arrhythmic substrate can be variable from re-entry to multifocal resulting in demanding requirements for electrophysiologic ablation procedures (EP) and thus, relatively high rates of recurrence. Methods and Results: Retrospective analysis of ACHD patients with prior Damus-Kaye-Stansel (DKS) surgery treated at one of the largest specialized tertiary centers for ACHD patients worldwide. Analysis focussed on occurrence of AT, respective treatment and outcome of EP. Over a median observation time of 15 years, 13 patients with prior DKS surgery and complex congenital heart defects of different types but uniformly Fontan circulation, were identified (median age 22.0 years (IQR 20.5 - 25.5), 76.9% male, 92.3% NYHA Class I, median systemic ventricular ejection fraction 58.5%, 69.2% extracardiac tunnel). Seven patients (53.8%) presented with symptomatic AT (median cyclic length 440 ms (IQR 360.0 - 517.5)). Of these, six patients underwent EP. Median procedure time was 180.5 min (IQR 160.8 - 274.5), median fluoroscopy time 1.56 min (IQR 0.51 - 4.73) and radiofrequency time 851 sec (265.0 -2005.0). Remote magnetic navigation was used to access ablation site through a retrograde access via the aortic as well as the neo-aortic valve. Three-dimensional image integration aided in mapping and ablation. Throughout the procedure as well as in follow-up visits, no reportable complications were observed. After a mean of 1.5 procedures, all analysed patients stayed complaint-free throughout a median time-interval of 13 months. Conclusion(s): AT are frequent in complex univentricular situations after Damus-Kaye-Stansel surgery (53.8%). Although more than one procedure (mean 1.5) was necessary to achieve satisfactory results even in experienced hands, EP appears to be an appropriate treatment strategy in this young and otherwise healthy patient cohort. According to our analysis, EP is feasible and safe in centers with knowledge of specific anatomic characteristics of congenital heart disease and when the appropriate technical infrastructure is present. Access to ablation site was performed by remote magnetic navigation in the majority of procedures. The floppy catheter was navigated through the neo-aortic as well as through the aortic valve without observable peri- or postinterventional complications. Mapping with three-dimensional image integration facilitated EP and led to a relatively low radiation exposure with the known benefits for the patient as well as for the healthcare professionals involved in the procedure.",Excluded
2696,"Optimal dose of contrast medium for depiction of hypervascular HCC on dynamic MDCT. Purpose: The purpose of this study is to prospectively investigate the optimal dose of contrast medium for the depiction of hypervascular hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) during the hepatic arterial phase (HAP), portal venous phase (PVP) and delayed phase (DP) of dynamic MDCT. Material(s) and Method(s): The study included 128 patients, out of these patients, 36 patients were found to have 56 hypervascular HCCs. Sixty-three patients were assigned to receive a dose of 525 mgI/kg with protocol A, and 62 received a dose of 630 mgI/kg with protocol B. Measurements of the attenuation values of the abdominal aorta, portal vein, hepatic vein, hepatic parenchyma and HCC during the HAP, PVP and DP were taken. Tumor-liver contrast (TLC) was calculated from the attenuation value of the hepatic parenchyma and HCC. Result(s): The aortic attenuation value with protocol B (351, 166, and 132 HU) was significantly higher than that with protocol A (313, 153, and 120 HU) during all the phases, (P < 0.01 for all phases). The hepatic enhancement from unenhanced baseline with protocol B (25.2, 63.6, 50.6 HU) was significantly higher than that with protocol A (20.2, 55.1 and 43.0 HU) during all the phases, (P < 0.01 for all phases). The TLC with protocol B (37.4, -11.8 and -13.6 HU) was significantly higher than that with protocol A (28.0, -9.8 and -12.1 HU) during HAP (P = 0.042). Conclusion(s): The administration of 630 mgI/kg of body weight depicts hypervascular HCC more clearly during HAP and shows sufficient hepatic enhancement of 50 HU during DP. © 2012 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

1284,"Chemoradiotherapy versus radiotherapy alone following induction chemotherapy for elderly patients with stage iii lung cancer. Purpose: It is unclear whether adding concurrent chemotherapy (CT) to definitive radiotherapy (RT) following induction CT is a tolerable and cost effective treatment for non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients aged 70 years or older with comorbidities. This study evaluated the actual clinical outcomes between concurrent chemoradiotherapy (CCRT) and RT alone following induction CT or not in patients (>=70 years) in a single institution's clinical practice. Material(s) and Method(s): A total of 82 patients with unresectable stage III NSCLC between 2004 and 2016 were retrospectively analyzed. Their treatment tolerance and clinical outcomes such as overall survival (OS), locoregional recurrence (LRR), treatment toxicities and distant metastasis (DM) were evaluated. Early mortality rates were also evaluated as 4-month mortality after RT. Result(s): Fifty-four patients received CCRT and 28 patients received RT alone. Induction CT before RT was performed for 68.5% and 50.0% in CCRT and RT alone groups. Treatment tolerance was significantly worse in CCRT (p = 0.046). The median survival was 21.1 and 18.1 months for CCRT and RT alone, which was not statistically significant. LRR and DM were also not different. Most early deaths after CCRT were attributed to non-cancer-related mortality. Acute esophagitis of grade >=2 occurred more following CCRT (p = 0.017). In multivariate analysis, a Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI) of >=5 and a weight loss of >=5% after RT were associated with poor OS. The factors adversely affecting 4-month survival were a CCI of >=5 and CCRT. Conclusion(s): There were no significant differences in OS, LRR, and DM between CCRT and RT alone treatment in elderly patients. However, there was a poorer tolerance and higher incidence of acute esophagitis in the CCRT group. Specifically, when the patients had a CCI of >=5, RT alone seems to be reasonable with a low probability of early death.Copyright © 2019. The Korean Society for Radiation Oncology.",Excluded
1469,"Dosimetry-based treatment for Graves' disease. Objective The aim of this retrospective study was to assess the long-Term outcome of a personalized dosimetry approach in Graves' disease aiming to render patients euthyroid from a planned thyroid absorbed dose of 60 Gy. Patients and methods A total of 284 patients with Graves' disease were followed prospectively following administration of radioiodine calculated to deliver an absorbed dose of 60 Gy. Patients with cardiac disease were excluded. Outcomes were analysed at yearly intervals for up to 10 years with a median follow-up of 37.5 months. Results A single radioiodine administration was sufficient to render a patient either euthyroid or hypothyroid in 175 (62%) patients, the remainder requiring further radioiodine. The median radioactivity required to deliver 60 Gy was 77 MBq. Less than 2% patients required 400-600 MBq, the standard activity administered in many centres. In the cohort receiving a single administration, 38, 32 and 26% were euthyroid on no specific thyroid medication at 3, 5 and 10 years, respectively. Larger thyroid volumes were associated with the need for further therapy. The presence of nodules on ultrasonography did not adversely affect treatment outcome. Conclusion A personalized dosimetric approach delayed the long-Term onset of hypothyroidism in 26% of patients. This was achieved using much lower administered activities than currently recommended. Future studies will aim to identify those patients who would benefit most from this approach.Copyright © 2018 The Author(s). Published by Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.",Excluded
2945,"Nasal cytological changes as late effects of radiotherapy for nasopharyngeal cancer. Background: Radiation therapy is a cornerstone in nasopharyngeal cancer treatment. However, it can induce acute and long-term adverse effects, such as acute mucositis and late submucosal fibrosis. Late toxicities could not only affect submucosa but also mucosal cells, determining long-term cytological changes. Objective(s): Evaluation of delayed nasal cytological alterations in patients who underwent radiation therapy for nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC). Method(s): In this case-control study, we analyzed 30 healthy subjects and 30 patients treated with chemotherapy and radiotherapy for NPC between 2003 and 2011, with a median follow-up of 59 months. All subjects underwent symptoms anamnestic evaluation (rhinorrea, nasal obstruction), endoscopic fiber optic nasal examination, skin-prick tests, and nasal scraping for cytological exam. Result(s): A higher percentage of rhinorrhea, nasal obstruction, mucosal hyperemia, and presence of nasopharyngeal secretions at fiber optic endoscopic exam was found in radiated subjects (p < 0.05). Nasal cytology analysis demonstrated a higher percentage of neutrophilic inflammation and squamous cell metaplasia and mucous cell metaplasia in treated patients (p < 0.05). No cytological atypia was seen. No statistically significant correlation between nasal cytological changes and objective findings, patients' age, tobacco smoking, and gastroesophageal reflux has been found in the radiotherapy group (p > 0.05). Conclusion(s): Radiation therapy induces late nasal mucosal changes, which may be related to clinical consequences, such as abundant mucus production and its consequent endonasal stagnation. In the future, detailed knowledge of cytological changes in patients' nasal mucosa could represent a key prerequisite for the choice of effective interventions for late radiation-induced rhinitis.Copyright © 2015, OceanSide Publications, Inc., U.S.A.",Excluded
401,"Factors influencing patient reported cosmetic outcome: Results of the Young Boost Trial. Purpose or Objective: The Young Boost trial (YBT), a multicenter RCT (NCT00212121), investigates whether a higher boost dose leads to a lower recurrence rate in young patients treated with breast conserving therapy. Cosmetic outcome is the secondary objective. The aim of the current analysis is to investigate the factors influencing the patients' opinion about cosmesis. Material(s) and Method(s): From 2004-2011, 2421 breast cancer patients <= 50 y rs w ere i ncluded i n T he Netherlands, France, and Germany. All patients were treated with lumpectomy, followed by 50 Gy whole breast irradiation. Patients were randomized to receive a standard 16 Gy (n=1211) or a high 26 Gy boost (n=1210) to the tumour bed. Cosmetic outcome data at 4 years of 807 patients were used for the current analysis according to the following two scoring systems: 1. BCCT.core: Digital photographs were analyzed using a software program to extract an overall cosmetic score: excellent, good, fair or poor. This score is based on symmetry, skin color and scar visibility. The 7 features of symmetry in the BCCT.core program are: nipple position (pBRA), level of lower breast contour (pLBC), level of nipple (pUNR), distance from nipple to inframammary fold (pBCE), length of breast contour (pBCD), area of the breast (pBAD) and non-overlapping area between left and right breast (pBOD). 2. Patients' score using a validated patient's questionnaire about the breast appearance, including an overall score: very satisfied, satisfied, not dissatisfied, dissatisfied or very dissatisfied. First, we analyzed the 7 features of BCCT.core in a proportional odds model, to investigate which parameters were related to the patients' opinion about cosmesis. In addition, we analyzed whether firmness, presence of rib pain or quality of life (QoL) aspects (EORTC QLQ C-30 questionnaire) at 4 years were related to the patients' opinion on cosmetic outcome. Result(s): Of the 7 BCCT.core parameters, pBCE and pBCD were significantly related to patients' score at 4 years. Patients with any difference in firmness rated their cosmesis worse than patients without any difference, even when the objective score (i.e. BCCT.core) was similar. This effect was larger by increasing difference. Worse perception of cosmetic outcome was also independently related to lower global QoL, lower emotional functioning and higher scores in the depression scale. The presence of rib pain had no influence. Conclusion(s): The patients' opinion on cosmetic outcome was significantly related to objective parameters like distance from nipple to inframammary fold (pBCE) and length of breast contour (pBCD), but also to subjective factors, i.e. severity of firmness, depressive feelings, global QoL and emotional functioning.",Excluded

731,"Production of androgenetic diploid loach by cold-shock of eggs fertilized with diploid sperm. Diploid androgenotes were produced without egg irradiation in the loach, Misgurnus anguillicaudatus. Eggs of wild-type diploid females were fertilized with diploid sperm of a neo-tetraploid male and then cold-shock treated at 3 degreeC (range, +/-0.5 degreeC) for 30 minutes just after fertilization to eliminate the female nucleus. After hatching, ploidy status of the hatched larvae was analyzed by flow cytometry, which revealed putative diploid androgenotes as well as larvae possessing other ploidies. Five independent microsatellite DNA markers were genotyped to confirm all-male inheritance of the resultant diploid larvae. The mean +/- SD yield rate of diploid androgenetic larvae to total eggs used was 12.29 +/- 3.25% in the cold-shock group and 22.23 +/- 13.42% in the UV-irradiated group (P > 0.05). No diploid androgenetic larvae were detected in the intact control group.

Background: To report about initial technical and clinical experience in preoperative radiation treatment of rectal cancer with volumetric modulated arcs with the RapidArc (RA) technology. Method(s): Twenty-five consecutive patients (pts) were treated with RA. All showed locally advanced rectal adenocarcinoma with stage T2-T4, N0-1. Dose prescription was 44 Gy in 22 fractions (or 45 Gy in 25 fractions). Delivery was performed with single arc with a 6 MV photon beam. Twenty patients were treated preoperatively, five did not receive surgery. Twenty-three patients received concomitant chemotherapy with oral capecitabine. A comparison with a cohort of twenty patients with similar characteristics treated with conformal therapy (3DC) is presented as well. Result(s): From a dosimetric point of view, RA improved conformality of doses (CI95% = 1.1 vs. 1.4 for RA and 3DC), presented similar target coverage with lower maximum doses, significant sparing of femurs and significant reduction of integral and mean dose to healthy tissue. From the clinical point of view, surgical reports resulted in a down-staging in 41% of cases. Acute toxicity was limited to Grade 1-2 diarrhoea in 40% and Grade 3 in 8% of RA pts, 45% and 5% of 3DC pts, compatible with known effects of concomitant chemotherapy. RA treatments were performed with an average of 2.0 vs. 3.4 min of 3DC. Conclusion(s): RA proved to be a safe, qualitatively advantageous treatment modality for rectal cancer, showing some improved results in dosimetric aspects. © 2010 Richetti et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",Excluded
3311,"Dose selection for radioiodine therapy of borderline hyperthyroid patients with multifocal and disseminated autonomy on the basis of 99mTc-pertechnetate thyroid uptake. The aim of this study was to optimise radioiodine therapy of diffuse and nodular toxic goitre by calculation of the radiation dose delivered to the thyroid on the basis of the pretreatment technetium-99m pertechnetate thyroid uptake under thyrotropin suppression (TcTU(s)). The TcTU(s) value serves as a substitute for the non-suppressible iodine turnover and the functional autonomous mass. Marinelli's formula was used to calculate tissue absorbed doses of 150 Gy, 200 Gy, 250 Gy and 300 Gy to the thyroids of 438 patients with multifocal and disseminated autonomy. The mean age of patients was 70+/-9 years, and the mean thyroid volume was 54+/-26 ml. Two hundred and sixty-one of the patients had at least one documented previous episode of overt hyperthyroidism. Tissue absorbed doses were adapted to the pretreatment TcTU(s): 150 Gy for a TcTU(s) of 1.5%-2.49%, 200 Gy for a TcTU(s) of 2.5%-3.49%, 250 Gy for a TcTU(s) of 3.5%-4.49% and 300 Gy for a TcTU(s) of > or =4.5%. Normalisation of TcTU(s) and thyrotropin (TSH), thyroid volume reduction and frequency of hypothyroidism and recurrent hyperthyroidism were evaluated 1 year after a single radioiodine therapy. The presented dose strategy resulted in normalisation of TcTU(s) in 96% and an increase in TSH to the normal range in 92%. Recurrent hyperthyroidism was observed in only five patients. Thyroid volume decreased from 54+/-26 before treatment to 34+/-20 ml, a mean reduction of 37%. The frequency of hypothyroidism, at 0.9%, was encouragingly low. Dose selection in accordance with pretreatment TcTU(s) can be recommended for elimination of functional autonomous tissue with a single radioiodine therapy in patients of advanced age with enlarged thyroid glands and relevant autonomous masses who are at risk of developing iodine-induced hyperthyroidism.",Excluded
1142,"The complex relationship between lung tumor volume and survival in patients with non-small cell lung cancer treated by definitive radiotherapy: A prospective, observational prognostic factor study of the Trans-Tasman Radiation Oncology Group (TROG 99.05). Background and purpose: To investigate the hypothesis that primary tumor volume is prognostic independent of T and N stages in patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) treated by definitive radiotherapy. Material(s) and Method(s): Multicenter prospective observational study. Patient eligibility: pathologically proven stage I-III non-small cell lung cancer planned for definitive radiotherapy (minimum 50 Gy in 20 fractions) using CT-based contouring. Volumes of the primary tumor and enlarged nodes were measured according to a standardized protocol. Survival was adjusted for the effect of T and N stage. Result(s): There were 509 eligible patients. Five-year survival rates for tumor volume grouped by quartiles were, for increasing tumor volume, 22%, 14%, 15% and 21%. Larger primary tumor volume was associated with shorter survival (HR = 1.060 (per doubling); 95% CI 1.01-1.12; P = 0.029). However, after adjusting for the effects of T and N stage, there was no evidence for an association (HR = 1.029, 95% CI, 0.96-1.10, P = 0.39). There was evidence, however, that larger primary tumor volume was associated with an increased risk of dying, independently of T and N stage, in the first 18 months but not beyond. Conclusion(s): In patients treated by non-surgical means we were unable to show that lung tumor volume, overall, provides additional prognostic information beyond the T and N stage (TNM, 6th edition). There is evidence, however, that larger primary tumor volume adversely affects outcome only within the first 18 months. Larger tumor size alone should not by itself exclude patients from curative (chemo)radiotherapy. © 2013 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.",Excluded
617,"Clinical outcomes of graves' ophthalmopathy treated with intensity modulated radiation therapy. BACKGROUND: Radiation for Graves' ophthalmopathy (GO) has traditionally utilized lateral opposing fields (LOF) or three-dimensional conformal radiotherapy (3DCRT) technique. The current study was conducted to report clinical outcomes and therapeutic effects of intensity modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) in treating GO patients., METHODS: One hundred sixteen patients with GO were treated with IMRT as initial local therapy between July 2010 and August 2013, with a median follow-up of 62 months (range 45-81 months). Radiotherapy dose was 20 Gy in 10 fractions within two to three weeks. The immediate and long-term response to IMRT was evaluated in GO severity score and in each category of symptoms. Acute and long-term complications were recorded to assess its safety., RESULTS: Symptom severity score significantly fell from the start of treatment to 4- or 6- month post-IMRT (P < 0.01). In total, 85 patients (73.3%) experienced improvement of GO symptoms in the first half-year, and only 4 of them (4.7%) suffered recurrence of the GO symptoms during the subsequent follow-ups. Orbital pain, tearing and extraocular muscle dysfunction had the best treatment reaction to IMRT, while proptosis and blurred vision were the most refractory symptoms. Acute complications were slight and self-limited, mainly including intermittent eye redness in 9 patients (7.8%), sideburns hair loss in 19 patients (16.4%), increased milphosis or madarosis in 23 patients (19.8%) and pseudo-progression of GO symptoms in 15 patients (12.9%). For long-term complications, chronic xerophthalmias occurred in 7 patients (6.03%), cataract developed in 2 patients (1.72%), and all were well-managed by medical interventions. Radiation retinopathy and secondary malignancy was not presented in the cohort., CONCLUSION: The study demonstrated that IMRT could serve as a viable option in treating GO patients, with a satisfactory symptom control ability, and relatively slight and acceptable post-radiotherapeutic complications.",Excluded
1246,"Irradiation induced inversions suppress recombination between the M locus and morphological markers in Aedes aegypti. Background: Aedes aegypti is the primary vector of arthropod-borne viruses and one of the most widespread and invasive mosquito species. Due to the lack of efficient specific drugs or vaccination strategies, vector population control methods, such as the sterile insect technique, are receiving renewed interest. However, availability of a reliable genetic sexing strategy is crucial, since there is almost zero tolerance for accidentally released females. Development of genetic sexing strains through classical genetics is hindered by genetic recombination that is not suppressed in males as is the case in many Diptera. Isolation of naturally-occurring or irradiation-induced inversions can enhance the genetic stability of genetic sexing strains developed through genetically linking desirable phenotypes with the male determining region. Result(s): For the induction and isolation of inversions through irradiation, 200 male pupae of the 'BRA' wild type strain were irradiated at 30 Gy and 100 isomale lines were set up by crossing with homozygous 'red-eye' (re) mutant females. Recombination between re and the M locus and the white (w) gene (causing a recessive white eye phenotype when mutated) and the M locus was tested in 45 and 32 lines, respectively. One inversion (Inv35) reduced recombination between both re and the M locus, and wand the M locus, consistent with the presence of a rather extended inversion between the two morphological mutations, that includes the M locus. Another inversion (Inv5) reduced recombination only between w and the M locus. In search of naturally-occurring, recombination-suppressing inversions, homozygous females from the red eye and the white eye strains were crossed with seventeen and fourteen wild type strains collected worldwide, representing either recently colonized or long-established laboratory populations. Despite evidence of varying frequencies of recombination, no combination led to the elimination or substantial reduction of recombination. Conclusion(s): Inducing inversions through irradiation is a feasible strategy to isolate recombination suppressors either on the M or the m chromosome for Aedes aegypti. Such inversions can be incorporated in genetic sexing strains developed through classical genetics to enhance their genetic stability and support SIT or other approaches that aim to population suppression through male-delivered sterility.Copyright © 2020, The Author(s).",Excluded

Aim To assess the effect of two iterative reconstruction algorithms (AIDR and AIDR3D) and individualized automatic tube current selection on radiation dose and image quality in computed tomography coronary angiography (CTCA). Materials and methods In a single-centre cohort study, 942 patients underwent electrocardiogram-gated CTCA using a 320-multidetector CT system. Images from group 1 (n = 228) were reconstructed with a filtered back projection algorithm (Quantum Denoising Software, QDS+). Iterative reconstruction was used for group 2 (AIDR, n = 379) and group 3 (AIDR3D, n = 335). Tube current was selected based on body mass index (BMI) for groups 1 and 2, and selected automatically based on scout image attenuation for group 3. Subjective image quality was graded on a four-point scale (1 = excellent, 4 = non-diagnostic). Results There were no differences in age (p = 0.975), body mass index (p = 0.435), or heart rate (p = 0.746) between the groups. Image quality improved with iterative reconstruction and automatic tube current selection [1.3 (95% confidence intervals (CI): 1.2-1.4), 1.2 (1.1-1.2) and 1.1 (1-1.2) respectively; p < 0.001] and radiation dose decreased [274 (260-290), 242 (230-253) and 168 (156-180) mGy cm, respectively; p < 0.001].

Purpose To document the ocular manifestations of xeroderma pigmentosum (XP), presenting via the United Kingdom (UK) XP service, and to analyze the correlations between XP genotype and ophthalmic phenotype. Design Prospective observational case series. Subjects Eighty-nine patients seen by the UK Nationally Commissioned XP Service, from April 2010 to December 2014, with a genetically confirmed diagnosis of XP. Methods Patients underwent a full ophthalmic examination at each visit. Clinical features from both eyes were recorded on a standard proforma. The most recent assessments were analyzed. A 2-tailed Fisher exact test was used to assess for differences in ocular features between patients in XP subgroups with impaired transcription coupled nucleotide excision repair (TC-NER) (category 1: XP-A, B, D, F, and G) and preserved TC-NER (category 2: XP-C, E, and V). Main Outcome Measures Lid and periocular abnormalities, ocular surface pathologies, neuro-ophthalmologic abnormalities, lens and retinal abnormalities, and visual acuity (VA). Results Ninety-three percent of XP patients in our cohort had ocular involvement, with 65% describing photophobia. The most common abnormalities were in the periocular skin and ocular surface, including interpalpebral conjunctival melanosis (44%) and conjunctival injection (43%). Eleven percent of patients had required treatment for periocular cancers and 2% for ocular surface cancers. The most common neuro-ophthalmologic finding was minimal pupillary reaction to light (25%). Patients in category 2 had significantly more ocular surface abnormalities than patients in category 1, including a greater proportion of conjunctival injection (P = 0.003), conjunctival corkscrew vessels (P < 0.001), corneal scarring (P = 0.01) and pingueculae under the age of 50 (P = 0.02). Meanwhile, patients in category 1 had a higher proportion of poorly reactive pupils (P < 0.001) and abnormal ocular movements (P = 0.03) compared with those in category 2. Five patients (6%) presented to ophthalmologists with ocular surface signs related to XP, before any formal diagnosis of XP was made. Conclusions A large proportion of XP patients have ocular involvement. Regular examination by an ophthalmologist is essential, especially in screening for eyelid and ocular surface tumors. The ocular phenotype-genotype segregation within XP patients suggests that XP is a heterogeneous and complex disease. With further study, we hope to offer these patients more individualized patient care.Copyright © 2017 American Academy of Ophthalmology",Excluded
2150,"Ocular surface squamous neoplasia (Squamous Cell Carcinoma) of the socket: Management of extensive tumors with interferon. PURPOSE:: To describe the clinical features and management of extensive ocular surface squamous neoplasia (OSSN) (squamous cell carcinoma) of the socket. METHOD(S):: Retrospective interventional case series. Interferon alpha 2b (IFNa2b) eye drops (1 million units/cc) 4 times daily and IFNa2b sublesional injection (5 million units/0.5cc to 8 million units/0.8 cc) were delivered for tumor control. Participants were 3 patients with ocular prosthesis who developed extensive socket OSSN. Tumor control was graded as complete regression, partial regression, or no regression. RESULT(S):: OSSN was detected in the socket at age 60, 43, and 20 years in patients who had worn ophthalmic prostheses for 54, 26, and 13 years, respectively. The patients had chronic discharge and irritation (n = 3) managed with intermittent topical corticosteroids (n = 2). There were no predisposing factors of cigarette exposure, radiation exposure, eczema, systemic immune suppression, or organ transplantation. The prosthesis fit well with nonirritative edges. At presentation, OSSN was subtle (n = 3), vascular (n = 3), and multifocal (n = 3), with largest lesions or confluence of lesions measuring 20, 25, and 20 mm, respectively. The tumors involved the tarsal (n = 3), bulbar (n = 2), and forniceal (n = 2) surfaces. All patients were treated with topical and injection IFNa2b, with complete regression achieved in 2 cases (at 1 months and 20 months) and partial regression in one case (at 9 months). All patients continue on chronic maintenance IFNa2b topically. There were no recurrences, and IFNa2b injection side effects of nausea and chills were minor, lasting 1 day. No patient required surgical removal of tumors from the socket and no patient required exenteration. CONCLUSION(S):: Patients wearing ophthalmic prosthesis over a socket should be monitored for the development of OSSN.

2515,"WORK PROCEDURES AND RADIATION EXPOSURE AMONG RADIOLOGIC TECHNOLOGISTS IN SOUTH KOREA. This study explored their work characteristics and safety compliance to identify primary factors influencing high occupational radiation exposure among radiologic technologists. A total of 12 387 radiologic technologists were surveyed from 2012 to 2013 in South Korea. Survey data for demographics and work-related characteristics were linked with the National Dose Registry. Multiple regression analysis was used and '% Excess Risk Explained' was calculated to illustrate the degree to which given risk factors explained the relationship of work procedures and radiation exposure. Characteristics of radiologic technologists exposed to higher radiation doses were male, aged <30, working at a general hospital or hospital, and frequently performing routine diagnostic X-ray, CT, portable X-ray and C-arm. Not being completely separated from patients and wearing lead apron was positively associated with higher radiation exposure. Type of facility and safety compliance were the main risk factors for high radiation exposure in performing diagnostic radiologic procedures.",Excluded

Objective: The aim of this study is to investigate the relationship and its correlation between liver fat content quantitative measured by MRS and body fat distribution measured by Dual-energy X-ray Absorptionmetry (DEXA). Method(s): 68 NAFLD patients were recruited in our outpatient department from July,2010 to February 2012 and NAFLD was diagnosed according to the criteria of 2010 Chinese Society of Hepatology. All subjects receive MRS and DEXA measurement at same time. The waist circumstances (WC), hip circumstances (HP) and Waist hip ratio (WHR), body mass index (BMI) were measured at same time. All subjects received serum total cholesterol (TC), triglyceride (TG), high density lipoprotein (HDL), low density lipoprotein(LDL) and HbA1c measurement. Body fat (BF), Fat-free mass index (FFMI), Fat mass index (FMI), Lean mass index (LMI) and fat distribution were observed and calculated. Body fat distribution was calculated and compared to the liver fat content respectively. Result(s): 1. There are linear correlation between liver fat content and waist circumference, BMI, the respectively correlation coefficient were 0.381, 0.383 (P< 0.01). 3. Liver fat content and body fat content has correlation and the correlation coefficient were 0.355 and 0.395 (P<0.05). There are strongest correlation between trunks fat (Trunk%). The correlation coefficient was 0.433 (P<0.01). 4. Male Liver fat content has much stronger correlation with FMI, upper part fat (UP%) and Trunk% than that of female patients, (male 0.581, 0.479, 0.709 VS female 0.31 0.312 0.29). Conclusion(s): Liver fat content and body fat distribution were positively correlated. The higher body fat content and upper body fat content were characteristics of fat distribution in subjects with NAFLD and the trunk fat can possibly reflect the liver fat content in clinical practice.",Excluded
1505,"Low contrast and radiation dose coronary CT angiography using a 320-row system and a refined contrast injection and timing method. BACKGROUND: Among CT scanners, 320-row instruments feature decreased photon energy and yield strong contrast enhancement. Consequently, the contrast medium (CM) dose can be reduced. The results of low-tube-voltage coronary CT angiography (CCTA) performed on 320-row scanners have not been adequately assessed., OBJECTIVE: We evaluated the effects of a low-contrast-dose protocol on the image quality of CCTA using 80 kVp tube voltage, iterative reconstruction (IR), and a 320-row scanner., METHODS: We randomly assigned 90 patients (mean body weight, 56.5 +/- 11.0 kg) to 1 of 3 CCTA protocols. Under protocol A, 30 were scanned using a conventional 120-kVp protocol and a standard CM dose (280 mg iodine/kg body weight [mgI/kg]). Another 30 underwent scanning at 80 kVp with a 25% CM dose reduction (210 mgI/kg; protocol B). Under protocol C, the remaining 30 patients were scanned at 80 kVp with a 50% CM dose reduction (140 mgI/kg). The 120 and 80 kVp images were processed with IR. Images obtained under the 3 protocols were subjected to quantitative and qualitative analysis., RESULTS: The amount of CM used in protocol A, B, and C was 43.6 +/- 10.1, 30.3 +/- 4.4, and 21.0 +/- 4.0 mL, respectively. Mean CT attenuation of the coronary arteries tended to be higher under protocol B than the other 2 protocols. The contrast-to-noise ratio was significantly higher under protocol B. The mean visual scores were significantly higher for protocols A and B than protocol C. The mean effective radiation dose was significantly lower under the 80-kVp protocol., CONCLUSION: With a 320-row scanner and our refined CM injection and timing protocol, it is technically feasible to obtain sufficient vascular enhancement with a reduction in the CM and/or radiation dose at 80-kVp CCTA with IR.

Objective: To investigate the low-dose chest computed tomography (CT) presentation and dynamic changes in patients with novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) to improve understanding of this highly infectious disease. Method(s): The clinical and CT data of 16 patients with COVID-19 were retrospectively analyzed. Dynamic CTs were performed continuously after admission. Result(s): Of the patients, 14 were moderate cases, and 2 were severe. Twelve patients underwent CT at the early onset stage. Single nodules or ground-glass opacities (GGOs) were found in 2 patients and multiple bilateral pulmonary lesions in 8 (consolidation-like opacities with or without small nodules in five and large GGOs with interlobular septal thickening in three). Ten had lesion growth and enlargement on the second CT. Fourteen patients underwent CT during the progressive stage, which revealed GGOs and focal consolidation in 6 of them, lung consolidation opacities in 5, and simple, large GGOs with interlobular septal thickening in 3. In both severe cases, the lesions continued to enlarge and grow, and the extent of consolidation continued to expand. Conclusion(s): Low-dose chest CT can clearly reflect the morphology, density, and extent of COVID-19 nodules, and is beneficial for observing dynamic nodule changes and disease screening and monitoring.Copyright © 2020 Beijing You'an Hospital affiliated to Capital Medical University",Excluded

BACKGROUND: Our aim was to review Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center's experience with postoperative intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) for paranasal sinus, nasal cavity, and lacrimal gland cancer and report dosimetric measures, toxicity, and outcomes., METHODS: Between September 2000 and June 2006, 37 patients with paranasal sinus, nasal cavity, or lacrimal gland cancer underwent postoperative IMRT. Median values were as follows: prescription dose, 60 Gy (range, 50-70); PTV(D95), 99% (range, 79-101%); optic nerve Dmax, 53 Gy (range, 2-54); optic chiasm Dmax, 51Gy (range, 2-55). Acute and late toxicities were scored by Radiation Therapy Oncology Group morbidity criteria., RESULTS: Median follow-up was 28 months. Two-year local progression-free and overall survivals were 75% and 80%. No early- or late-grade 3/4 radiation-induced ophthalmologic toxicity occurred., CONCLUSIONS: Preliminary results show that adjuvant IMRT in these patients is feasible, allowed for excellent planning target volume (PTV) coverage, and minimized dose delivered to optic structures.

Background The purpose of this study was to describe our clinical experience using stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) to treat medically inoperable stage I non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) in very elderly patients. Patients and Methods Twenty-four consecutive octogenarians with stage I NSCLC were treated with SBRT between 2007 and 2011 at a single center. Median prescription dose was 48 Gy (range, 48-56). Follow-up clinical examination and computed tomography (CT) were performed every 2 to 3 months. Results Median age was 85 years (range, 80-89). Twenty-three (96%) patients had peripheral tumors, and median tumor size was 22 mm (range, 11-49). Tissue diagnosis was obtained in 16 (67%) patients. Median follow-up for all patients was 27.6 months (range, 4.3-61.2). The 24-month disease-free survival was 77% (95% confidence interval [CI], 61%-97%). The 24-month overall survival (OS) was 74% (95% CI, 57%-94%). No local failure (LF) was observed during the period of observation. Nodal failure (NF) and distant failure (DF) occurred in 2 and 4 patients, respectively. The cumulative incidence of competing mortality at 24 months was estimated at 13% (95% CI, 3%-30%). No difference in outcomes with or without tissue diagnosis was observed. No grade >= 3 early or late treatment-related toxicities were observed.

1783,"Impact of radiation dose to neural stem cell niche on outcomes in malignant gliomas 4. Background: Malignant gliomas represent most aggressive form of brain tumours. They are characterised by poor prognosis and universal recurrences. Recent studies indicate that malignant gliomas contain cancer stem cells which are capable of self-renewal and tumour propagation. The origin Gliomas Cancer stem cells is believed to be from normal neuronal stem cells (NSC) located in subventricular zone (SVZ) of adult human brain. The purpose of this study was to examine the relationship between radiation dose to the subventricular zone and survival in malignant glioma patients. Method(s): 40 adult patients diagnosed as Grade III or Grade IV Glioma at Yashoda Hospitals between January of 2014 and July of 2014 were included in this study. Using radiation planning software and patient radiological records, the subventricular zone was reconstructed for each of these patients and dosimetry data for these structures was calculated. Log Rank Test and Multivariate analysis were used to find the impact of High Subventricular Zone dose on survival. Result(s): The mean of age of the sample population is 49.68 years (range, 20-78 years). ECOG Status for the all the patients enrolled in the study is 1. Out of 40 patients enrolled into the trial 31 are of Grade 4 Tumors (Glioblastoma) and 9 were Grade 3 tumours. Median doses of the means of Ipsilateral subventricular zone, Contralateral subventricular zone and Total subventricular zone are 50.89, 34.66 and 41.04 respectively. Median overall survival of the sample population is 21 months. One year survival of the sample population is 85%; 2 year survival is 35%. Univariate analysis has not shown any significant impact higher median dose in malignant gliomas. However when Univariate analysis was done in Grade IV gliomas there is significant impact of higher median dose to Ipsilateral Subventricular zone (P value 0.01) and Total Subventricular zone on Overall survival (P value 0.04). Conclusion(s): This study leads us to hypothesize that in glioma targeted radiotherapy of the stem cell niches in the adult brain could yield significant benefits over radiotherapy of the primary tumor mass alone.

973,"Venous gas emboli and exhaled nitric oxide with simulated and actual extravehicular activity. The decompression experienced due to the change in pressure from a space vehicle (1013hPa) to that in a suit for extravehicular activity (EVA) (386hPa) was simulated using a hypobaric chamber. Previous ground-based research has indicated around a 50% occurrence of both venous gas emboli (VGE) and symptoms of decompression illness (DCI) after similar decompressions. In contrast, no DCI symptoms have been reported from past or current space activities. Twenty subjects were studied using Doppler ultrasound to detect any VGE during decompression to 386hPa, where they remained for up to 6h. Subjects were supine to simulate weightlessness. A large number of VGE were found in one subject at rest, who had a recent arm fracture; a small number of VGE were found in another subject during provocation with calf contractions. No changes in exhaled nitric oxide were found that can be related to either simulated EVA or actual EVA (studied in a parallel study on four cosmonauts). We conclude that weightlessness appears to be protective against DCI and that exhaled NO is not likely to be useful to monitor VGE.",Excluded
200,"Gene-arsenic interaction in longitudinal changes of blood pressure: Findings from the Health Effects of Arsenic Longitudinal Study (HEALS) in Bangladesh. Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide and mounting evidence indicates that toxicant exposures can profoundly impact on CVD risk. Epidemiologic studies have suggested that arsenic (As) exposure is positively related to increases in blood pressure (BP), a primary CVD risk factor. However, evidence of whether genetic susceptibility can modify the association between As and BP is lacking. In this study, we used mixed effect models adjusted for potential confounders to examine the interaction between As exposure from well water and potential genetic modifiers on longitudinal change in BP over approximately 7. years of follow-up in 1137 subjects selected from the Health Effects of Arsenic Longitudinal Study (HEALS) cohort in Bangladesh. Genotyping was conducted for 235 SNPs in 18 genes related to As metabolism, oxidative stress and endothelial function. We observed interactions between 44 SNPs with well water As for one or more BP outcome measures (systolic, diastolic, or pulse pressure (PP)) over the course of follow-up. The interaction between CYBA rs3794624 and well water As on annual PP remained statistically significant after correction for multiple comparisons (FDR-adjusted p for interaction = 0.05). Among individuals with the rs3794624 variant genotype, well water As was associated with a 2.23. mm. Hg (95% CI: 1.14-3.32) greater annual increase in PP, while among those with the wild type, well water As was associated with a 0.13. mm. Hg (95% CI: 0.02-0.23) greater annual increase in PP. Our results suggest that genetic variability may contribute to As-associated increases in BP over time.Copyright © 2015 Published by Elsevier Inc.",Excluded

3527,"Agreement between SPECT V/Q scan and CT angiography in patients with high clinical suspicion of PE. Objective: To track agreement between single positron emission computed tomography (SPECT) V/Q and CT angiography in patients with high clinical suspicion of pulmonary embolism (PE). If significant agreement occurs, a case could be made for more frequent use of chest radiography followed by SPECT V/Q scanning given its lower risk profile. Introduction: Diagnosis of PE can be difficult. CT pulmonary angiography (CTA) is the preferred initial test, but may be indeterminate, is a significant source of ionizing radiation, and is contraindicated in renal insufficiency. SPECT ventilation/perfusion imaging (V/Q) is therefore preferred in certain patients. Method(s): Two thousand nine hundred and twenty patients admitted to a tertiary care hospital in New York City were screened and 100 consecutive high-risk patients who required both CTA and V/Q for an initial indeterminate or negative imaging test despite a high pre-test probability were identified. The agreement between these tests was evaluated. Result(s): There was no significant agreement between CTA and V/Q when positive, negative and indeterminate results were included (K = 0.18, SE = 0.09, p = 0.051). However, in the presence of a positive finding on either test, there was substantial agreement between the two (K = 0.62, SE = 0.27, p = 0.02). In 30 cases in which CTA was indeterminate, V/Q was diagnostic 93 % of the time. In 12 cases in which V/Q was indeterminate, CTA was diagnostic 83 % of the time and negative in 100 % of those cases. Conclusion(s): In the presence of an indeterminate CTA in patients with high clinical suspicion of PE, SPECT V/Q often provides a diagnosis. © 2013 The Japanese Society of Nuclear Medicine.",Excluded

The present study was designed to evaluate the effect of acute level of 60Co gamma radiation on fecundity of freshwater prawn Macrobrachium rosenbergii. Prawns were exposed to four different dose levels (3, 30, 300 and 3000 mGy) and their reproductive disturbances i.e Gonadosomatic Index (GSI), Egg Clutch somatic Index (ESI), Egg Counts and Egg hatching rates were calculated. The experimental group showed significant reduction in GSI (0.47 +/- 0.01) & ESI (1.22 +/- 0.08) after exposure to 60Co gamma radiation. Egg Count (3713 +/- 21) and Egg hatching rates (3798 +/- 11) were significantly reduced in all irradiated groups. The number of dead larva increased with the increasing level of doses. With the increase in dosage level, the gonad and egg clutch weight were decreased which likely lead to reduced number of eggs.

This was a prospective study of 40 adult patients who underwent NECT-KUB for investigation of ureteric colic. Images were reconstructed using FBP, SIR, and MBIR techniques and individually and randomly assessed by two blinded radiologists. Parameters measured were overall image quality, presence of ureteric calculus, presence of hydronephrosis or hydroureters, image quality of each ureteric segment, total length of ureters unable to be visualized, attenuation values of image noise, and retroperitoneal fat content for each patient. There were no diagnostic discrepancies between image reconstruction modalities for urolithiasis. Overall image qualities and for each ureteric segment were superior using MBIR (67.5 % rated as 'Good to Excellent' vs. 25 % in SIR and 2.5 % in FBP). The lengths of non-visualized ureteric segments were shortest using MBIR (55.0 % measured 'less than 5 cm' vs. ASIR 33.8 % and FBP 10 %).

953,"Response-driven imaging biomarkers for predicting radiation necrosis of the brain. Radiation necrosis is an uncommon but severe adverse effect of brain radiation therapy (RT). Current predictive models based on radiation dose have limited accuracy. We aimed to identify early individual response biomarkers based upon diffusion tensor (DT) imaging and incorporated them into a response model for prediction of radiation necrosis. Twenty-nine patients with glioblastoma received six weeks of intensity modulated RT and concurrent temozolomide. Patients underwent DT-MRI scans before treatment, at three weeks during RT, and one, three, and six months after RT. Cases with radiation necrosis were classified based on generalized equivalent uniform dose (gEUD) of whole brain and DT index early changes in the corpus callosum and its substructures. Significant covariates were used to develop normal tissue complication probability models using binary logistic regression. Seven patients developed radiation necrosis. Percentage changes of radial diffusivity (RD) in the splenium at three weeks during RT and at six months after RT differed significantly between the patients with and without necrosis (p = 0.05 and p = 0.01). Percentage change of RD at three weeks during RT in the 30 Gy dose-volume of the splenium and brain gEUD combined yielded the best-fit logistic regression model. Our findings indicate that early individual response during the course of RT, assessed by radial diffusivity, has the potential to aid the prediction of delayed radiation necrosis, which could provide guidance in dose-escalation trials.",Excluded

717,"High incidence of mosaic mutations induced by irradiating paternal germ cells of the medaka fish, Oryzias latipes. Delayed-type mutations induced by radiation have recently been demonstrated in various somatic-cell systems. Such mutations are thought to result from the transmission of genetic instability through many cell divisions subsequent to a single exposure to ionizing radiation. Here, we have examined whether 'transgenerational' delayed-type mutations can arise during embryonic development of the medaka fish as a result of exposing the sperm and spermatids of live fish to 137 Cs gamma-radiation. To do this, we made use of a sensitive specific-locus test (SLT) for the medaka that we have recently developed. Because the medaka has a transparent egg membrane and embryo body, both visible mosaics and whole-body mutations can be detected during development at an early-expressed pigmentation locus. When wild-type +/+ males were gamma-irradiated and then mated with wl/wl females, the frequency of F1 embryos with both wild-type orange leucophores (wl/+) and mutant-type white leucophores (wl/wl*) (mosaic mutants) was about 5.7 x 10-3/Gy. The frequency of embryos with only white leucophores (whole-body mutants) was about 1.3 x 10-3/Gy. These results suggest that delayed mutations frequently arise in medaka fish embryos that have been fertilized with irradiated sperm. Some possible mechanisms involved in the generation of these delayed mutational events (including genomic instability in the early embryos) are discussed. © 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.",Excluded

There was a difference in length of occlusion (mm): RCA - 30.5+/-13.5, LAD - 25.5+/-9.9, Cx - 20.2+/-8.3 (p<0.05 for all changes). J-CTO score for each coronary artery was as follows: 0 - 10.9% LAD (n=9) 23.9% Cx (n=11), 11.0% RCA (n=14); 1 - 31.7% LAD (n=26), 45.6% Cx (n=21), 22.8% RCA (n=29); 2 - LAD 37.8% (n=31), 19.6% Cx (n=9), 38.5% RCA (n=49); >=3 - LAD 19.5% (n=16), 10.9% Cx (n=5), 27.5% RCA (n=34). Mean J-CTO score for LAD was 2.19+/-0.95, for Cx 2.13+/-1.14, and for RCA 2.29+/-1.07 (p=NS between arteries). The longest procedure time of the revascularisation was PCI of the RCA (77.1+/-34.9 min, p<0.05 relative to the remaining vessels). Procedure time between the LAD (65.9+/-28.8 min) and the Cx (56.6+/-26 8 min) did not differ significantly. Fluoroscopy time was also the longest during PCI of the RCA (31.0+/-19.2 min, p<0.005 relative to other arteries), and did not differ between Cx (20.0+/-12.2 min) and LAD (25.3+/-16.8 min). There was no difference in the radiation dose (Gy): 2.5+/-1.7 vs. 2.2+/-1.3 vs. 2.5+/-1.3 (RCA, Cx and LAD, respectively) among vessels. The volume of contrast was similar during PCI of the RCA and LAD (365.8+/-161.6 vs. 371.3+/-149.4 mL, p=NS) and was significantly higher in comparison to PCI of the Cx (279.6+/-150.9 mL). The reverse technique (retrograde) was used most frequently during PCI of the RCA (30.4%, n=38), then LAD (19.1%, n=16) and significantly less during PCI of the Cx (4.4%, n=2). The number of implanted stents was significantly higher in PCI of the RCA (1.9+/-0.8) and did not differ between the LAD (1.3+/-0.6) and Cx (1.1+/-0.4). There was no difference in the incidence of complications depending on the artery opened: there was 1 stroke and 1 myocardial infarction during PCI of the RCA and 2 smaller perforations during PCI of the LAD and Cx. One tamponade was observed during PCI of the RCA. Efficacy of recanalisation was similar for all of the arteries: 82.4% for the RCA (n=103), 84.5% for the LAD (n=71), and 91.3% for the Cx (n=46). Conclusion(s): The most common artery we revascularised was the right coronary artery. It was characterised by the longest length of occlusion and required the longest procedure time and fluoroscopy time. Furthermore, it required the highest amount of contrast medium and number of implanted stents. Nevertheless, the efficacy was similar for all vessels.",Excluded
155,"Increased evidence for the prognostic value of FDG uptake on late-treatment PET in non-tumour-affected oesophagus in irradiated patients with oesophageal carcinoma. PURPOSE: 18F-FDG uptake in irradiated non-tumour-affected oesophagus (NTO) on restaging PET is a potential surrogate for the measurement of radiation-induced inflammation. Radiation-induced inflammation itself has been shown to be of high prognostic relevance in patients undergoing preoperative radiochemotherapy (RCT) for locally advanced oesophageal cancer. We assessed the prognostic relevance of FDG uptake in the NTO in an independent cohort of patients treated with definitive RCT., METHODS: This retrospective evaluation included 72 patients with oesophageal squamous cell carcinoma treated with definitive RCT with curative intent. All patients underwent pretreatment and restaging FDG PET after receiving a radiation dose of 40-50 Gy. Standardized uptake values (SUVmax/SUVmean), metabolic tumour volume (MTV) and relative changes from pretreatment to restaging PET (SUVmax/SUVmean) were determined within the tumour and NTO. Univariate Cox regression with respect to overall survival (OS), local control (LC), distant metastases (DM) and treatment failure (TF) was performed. Independence of parameters was tested by multivariate Cox regression., RESULTS: SUVmax NTO and MTV were prognostic factors for all investigated clinical endpoints (OS, LC, DM, TF). Inclusion of clinical and PET tumour parameters in multivariate analysis showed that SUVmax NTO was an independent prognostic factor. Furthermore, multivariate analysis of SUVmax NTO using previously published cut-off values from preoperatively treated patients revealed that SUVmax NTO was independent prognostic factor for OS (HR = 1.88, p = 0.038), TF (HR = 2.11, p = 0.048) and DM (HR = 3.02, p = 0.047)., CONCLUSION: NTO-related tracer uptake during the course of treatment in patients with oesophageal carcinoma was shown to be of high prognostic relevance. Thus, metabolically activity of NTO measured in terms of SUVmax NTO is a potential candidate for future treatment individualization (i.e. organ preservation).",Excluded
1106,"IN-VIVO RADIATION DOSIMETRY USING PORTABLE L BAND EPR: ON-SITE MEASUREMENT OF VOLUNTEERS IN FUKUSHIMA PREFECTURE, JAPAN. The aim of this study was to make direct measurements of the possible radiation-induced EPR signals in the teeth of volunteers who were residents in Fukushima within 80 km distance from the Fukushima Nuclear Power plant at the time of the disaster, and continued to live there for at least 3 month after the disaster. Thirty four volunteers were enrolled in this study. These measurements were made using a portable L-band EPR spectrometer, which was originally developed in the EPR Center at Dartmouth. All measurements were performed using surface loop resonators that have been specifically designed for the upper incisor teeth. Potentially these signals include not only radiation-induced signals induced by the incident but also background signals including those from prior radiation exposure from the environment and medical exposure. We demonstrated that it is feasible to transport the dosimeter to the measurement site and make valid measurements. The intensity of the signals that were obtained was not significantly above those seen in volunteers who had not had potential radiation exposures at Fukushima.Copyright © The Author 2016.

505,"68Ga-DOTATATE PET/CT, 99mTc-HYNIC-octreotide SPECT/CT, and whole-body MR imaging in detection of neuroendocrine tumors: A prospective trial. Methods: Nineteen consecutive patients (34-77 y old; mean, 54.3 +/- 10.4 y old; 10 men and 9 women) underwent SSRS SPECT/CT, 68Ga-DOTATATE PET/CT, and WB DWI. Images were acquired with a maximum interval of 3 mo between them and were analyzed with masking by separate teams. Planar whole-body imaging and SPECT/CT were performed from thorax to pelvis using a double-head 16-slice SPECT/CT scanner 4 h after injection of 111-185 MBq of 99mTc-HYNIC-octreotide. 68Ga-DOTATATE PET/CT was performed from head to feet using a 16-slice PET/CT scanner 45 min after injection of 185 MBq of tracer. WB DWI was performed in the coronal plane using a 1.5-T scanner and a body coil. The standard method of reference for evaluation of image performance was undertaken: consensus among investigators at the end of the study, clinical and imaging follow-up, and biopsy of suggestive lesions., There are different metabolic imaging methods, various tracers, and emerging anatomic modalities to stage neuroendocrine tumor (NET). We aimed to compare NET lesion detectability among 99mTc-hydrazinonicotinamide (HYNIC)-octreotide (somatostatin receptor scintigraphy [SSRS]) SPECT/CT, 68Ga-DOTATATE PET/CT, and whole-body diffusion-weighted MR imaging (WB DWI)., Results: McNemar testing was applied to evaluate the detectability of lesions using 68Ga-DOTATATE PET/CT in comparison to SSRS SPECT/CT and WB DWI: a significant difference in detectability was noted for pancreas (P = 0.0455 and P = 0.0455, respectively), gastrointestinal tract (P = 0.0455 and P = 0.0455), and bones (P = 0.0082 and P = 0.0082). Two unknown primary lesions were identified solely by 68Ga-DOTATATE PET/CT. 68Ga-DOTATATE PET/CT, SSRS SPECT/CT, and WB DWI demonstrated, respectively, sensitivities of 0.96, 0.60, and 0.72; specificities of 0.97, 0.99, and 1.00; positive predictive values of 0.94, 0.96, and 1.00; negative predictive values of 0.98, 0.83, and 0.88; and accuracies of 0.97, 0.86, and 0.91., Conclusion: 68Ga PET/CT seems to be more sensitive for detection of well-differentiated NET lesions, especially for bone and unknown primary lesions. NET can be staged with 68Ga-DOTATATE PET/CT. WB DWI is an efficient new method with high accuracy and without ionizing radiation exposure. SSRS SPECT/CT should be used only when 68Ga-DOTATATE PET/CT and WB DWI are not available.Copyright COPYRIGHT © 2014 by the Society of Nuclear Medicine and Molecular Imaging, Inc.",Excluded
3668,"Prevalence of incidental or unexpected findings on low-dose CT performed during routine SPECT/CT nuclear medicine studies. INTRODUCTION: In nuclear medicine, single-photon-emission computed tomography (SPECT) is often combined with 'simultaneous' low-dose CT (LDCT) to provide complementary anatomical and functional correlation. As a consequence, numerous incidental and unexpected findings may be detected on LDCT. Recognition of these findings and appropriate determination of their relevance can add to the utility of SPECT/CT. We aimed to evaluate the prevalence and categorise the relevance of incidental and unexpected findings on LDCT scans performed as part of routine SPECT/CT studies., METHODS: All available LDCT scans performed as part of SPECT/CT studies at St. Vincent's Hospital Melbourne in the year 2013 were retrospectively reviewed. Two qualified radiologists independently reviewed the studies and any previous available imaging and categorised any detected incidental findings., RESULTS: A total of 2447 LDCT studies were reviewed. The relevance of the findings was classified according to a modified version of a scale used in the Colonography Reporting and Data System: E1 = normal or normal variant (28.0%); E2 = clinically unimportant (63.5%); E3 = likely unimportant or incompletely characterised (6.2%); E4 = potentially important (2.5%)., CONCLUSION: Imaging specialists need to be cognisant of incidental and unexpected findings present on LDCT studies performed as part of SPECT/CT. Appropriate categorisation of findings and communication of potentially important findings to referring clinicians should form part of routine practice. The overall prevalence of potentially significant incidental and unexpected findings in our series was 8.7% (E3, 6.2%; E4, 2.5%) and was comparable to rates in other published imaging series.

3458,"Temozolomide and irradiation combined treatment-induced Nrf2 activation increases chemoradiation sensitivity in human glioblastoma cells. Resistance to chemoradiotherapy is a major obstacle to successful treatment of glioblastoma. Recently, the role of NF-E2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) in enhancing chemoradiation sensitivity has been reported in several types of cancers. Here, we investigated whether temozolomide (TMZ) and irradiation (IR) combined treatment induced Nrf2 activation in human glioblastoma cells. And we further performed a preliminary study about the effect of Nrf2 on chemoradiation sensitivity. Immunohistochemical staining for Nrf2 in paired clinical specimens showed that TMZ and IR combined treatment increased the expression and nuclear localization of Nrf2 in human glioblastoma tissues. Moreover, we found nuclear Nrf2 expression in the glioblastoma tissues obtained from the patients undergoing TMZ and IR combined treatment was associated with the time to tumor recurrence. In vitro, we further verified these findings. First, we detected increased nuclear localization of Nrf2 following treatment with TMZ+IR in human glioblastoma cell lines. Second, we demonstrated TMZ+IR increased the levels of Nrf2 protein in both nuclear and cytoplasmic fractions of U251 cells and induced Nrf2 target genes expression. Finally, downregulating Nrf2 expression increased TMZ+IR-induced cell death in the U251 cells. These findings suggest TMZ+IR combined treatment induces Nrf2 activation in human glioblastoma cells. The activation of Nrf2 may be associate with enhancing chemoradiation sensitivity in human glioblastoma cell. Blocking Nrf2 activation may be a promising method enhancing chemoradiation sensitivity of glioblastoma cells.",Excluded
2597,"Clinical experience in 89 consecutive cases of chronic radiation enterocolitis. BACKGROUND: Pelvic irradiation has been a popular therapy modality for cervical cancer for many years, and its usage in rectal cancer and prostate cancer cases is on the rise. However, it is associated with significant side effects. In this study, we compared the different characteristics of surgical and nonsurgical patients who were treated for radiation enterocolitis, the treatment results, posttreatment quality of life (QOL), nutrition status, and predisposing factors for surgery., METHODS: From 1985 to 2009, the records of a total of 89 patients with chronic radiation enterocolitis in our hospital were retrospectively reviewed for demographic data, operative data and long-term treatment results. Posttreatment QOL and nutrition status were also recorded. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed to identify the independent predicting factors associated with surgical intervention. Characteristics of surgical and nonsurgical patients were compared., RESULTS: Radiotherapy before 1995, concomitant radiation uropathy and smoking were independent predictive factors for surgery. Surgical and nonsurgical cases had similar Kaplan-Meier curves. Although the recurrence rate of radiation enterocolitis was much higher for the surgical group (p = 0.031), both groups had similar QOL score (median: 8 vs.7; p = 0.709), serum albumin level (3.29 g/dL vs. 3.16 g/dL; p = 0.095), and body mass index (20.19 vs. 19.86; p = 0.603)., CONCLUSIONS: We confirmed that as compared with recently developed innovative techniques, early primitive radiotherapy techniques were associated with more severe radiotherapy complications that required surgery. Smoking may enhance patients' vulnerability to severe radiation injury. Surgery for radiation-induced intestinal obstruction, intestinal fistula and perforation is warranted because QOL, serum albumin level and body mass index were similar between the surgical and nonsurgical groups.

3035,"LOW BMI PATIENT DOSE IN DIGITAL RADIOGRAPHY. In this study, the radiation dose received by 364 low body mass index (BMI) adult patients undergoing chest, abdomen, lumbar spine, kidneys and urinary bladder (KUB) and pelvis X-ray examinations in an X-ray room with a digital radiography system was evaluated. The patients' kerma area product (KAP) values were recorded, and the entrance surface air kerma (ESAK) was calculated based on the X-ray tube output, exposure parameters and technical data. The 75th percentiles of the distribution of ESAK and KAP values were also estimated. The dose values were compared with the corresponding values for normal patients obtained from a previous survey in our hospital, as well as with the national and UK diagnostic reference levels (DRLs). The correlation of dose values with patient size metrics (mass, height, BMI) was also investigated. A statistically significant difference was found in KAP and the ESAK values between low BMI and normal patients (Mann-Whitney test, p < 0.05), for all examinations studied. The percentage difference for chest PA, chest LAT, abdomen PA, lumbar spine AP, lumbar spine LAT, pelvis AP and KUB AP examinations was 40, 36, 48, 68, 57, 46 and 67% for median KAP and 26, 43, 52, 48, 19, 44 and 51% for median ESAK, respectively. The corresponding 75th percentiles for low BMI patients were 0.065, 0.349, 0.683, 1.54, 3.92, 1.11, 0.67 mGy and 0.042, 0.218, 0.450, 0.280, 0.598, 0.597, 0.267 Gycm2 in terms of ESAK and KAP values, respectively. They were 74-90% lower compared to the national diagnostic reference levels (DRLs), 35-84% and 58-82% compared to the UK DRLs, for ESAK and KAP values, respectively. Regarding the gender of the patients, no statistically significant difference was found in the dose values between female and male patients (Mann-Whitney test, p > 0.05), for all examinations studied. A statistically significant correlation was found between ESAK and KAP values with BMI for KUB AP, pelvis AP, lumbar spine AP, lumbar spine LAT and chest PA, while for chest LAT examinations, only the ESAK were significantly correlated with BMI. They also significantly correlated with the mass for KUB AP, lumbar spine LAT, abdomen PA and chest PA examinations, while no significant correlation was found between the dose values and patients' height. It can be concluded that the low BMI patients received a significantly reduced radiation dose compared to normal patients. Additional studies need to be conducted for these patient groups, which could contribute to the further development of a radiation protection culture in diagnostic radiography.Copyright © The Author(s) 2020.

3233,"Chemoradiation for advanced oral and (pharyngo) laryngeal carcinoma: Single institution outcome analysis. Aim. Chemoradiation (CRT) is a valuable treatment option for(pharyngo)laryngeal squamous cell cancer and a palliative cure in advanced oral cancers. However, toxicity is scarcely reported. Therefore, efficacy, acute and toxic effects of chemoradiation for advanced head and neck squamous cell carcinomas were evaluated, using retrospective study. Methods. Previously untreated patients with stage III-IV head and neck squamous cell carcinomas were included. Radiotherapy consisted of 70 Gy/7 weeks/35 fractions. All patients received concurrent Cisplatin 40 mg/m2 weekly. Results. The most common acute toxic effects were dysphagia and mucositis. Dysphagia and xerostomia remained problematic during follow-up. Loco regional disease control was respectively 91% and 98% after 6 months. The median overall survival (calculating starting form the end of the treatment) was 33 months (range 0-111 months). The 5-year disease specific survival was 41%. Conclusion. The results indicated that concurrent chemoradiotherapy for advanced head and neck squamous cell carcinoma is associated with high locoregional control and disease-specific survival. However, significant acute and long-term toxic effects occur, and organ preservation appears not necessarily equivalent to preservation of function in pharyngolaryngeal cancers.",Excluded
1151,"The effect of caffeine on repair systems in oocytes of Drosophila melanogaster. II. The induction of chromosome aberrations in irradiated males. Irradiated males were mated to females that had received treatment with caffeine or honey (by feeding), and the frequencies of sex chromosome losses and chromosome rearrangements induced in mature spermatozoa of the males were compared. Caffeine treatment led to an enhancement of the frequencies of sex chromosome loss and a decrease in those of rearrangements. These findings can be interpreted on the assumption that caffeine inhibits repair and misrepair processes that are active in the oocytes. Caffeine treatment administered to one of the female stocks used in these studies was without any effect, presumably because of the absence of a caffeine sensitive repair mechanism in the oocytes.",Excluded
1678,"The impact of body mass index on the efficacy and safety of catheter ablation of atrial fibrillation. Background: Obesity is a well established risk factor for atrial fibrillation (AF) development. Our purpose was to determine the impact of body mass index (BMI) on the safety and efficacy of radiofrequency catheter ablation of AF. Method(s): Two hundred and twenty-six consecutive patients with symptomatic, drug-refractory paroxysmal (59.3%) and persistent (40.7%) AF underwent wide circumferential electrical pulmonary vein isolation. Patients were classified according to BMI as normal (< 25 kg/m2); overweight (25 to 29.9 kg/m2); and obese (>= 30 kg/m2). Result(s): Patients with high BMI were younger and displayed a higher rate of hypertension, increased left atrial diameter, increased left ventricular end-diastolic and end-systolic diameters, and increased levels of several conventional markers of inflammation and oxidative stress including white blood cell count, fibrinogen, uric acid, alanine aminotransferase, and gamma-glutamyltransferase (p < 0.05). After a mean follow-up period of 432.32 +/- 306.09 days from the index procedure, AF recurrence rate was 34.9% for normal weight, 46.2% for overweight, and 46.2% for obese patients (p: 0.258). Subjects classified above the 50th percentile for BMI displayed a trend toward a higher AF recurrence rate (p: 0.08). In univariate Cox regression survival analysis, BMI was not predictive of AF recurrence. Radiation exposure was significantly higher in overweight and obese patients in relation to normal weight patients (p: 0.003). No significant differences regarding major complications were observed among BMI groups. Conclusion(s): In this study population, BMI was not an independent predictor of AF recurrence following left atrial catheter ablation. © 2011 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.",Excluded
1043,"Computed tomography evaluation of the femoral and tibial attachments of the posterior cruciate ligament in vitro. PURPOSE: The optimal technique for reconstruction of the posterior cruciate ligament (PCL) is controversial. Regardless of surgical technique and graft choice, anatomic graft placement is essential for successful outcome. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the size and location of the insertions of the PCL using a computed tomography (CT) protocol., METHODS: The insertions in ten knees were marked in vitro with plastic markers. The CT examination was performed with the knee in extension. On the femur, the position of the center of the insertion site was evaluated relative to Blumensaat's line and the anterior articular surface. On the tibia, the location of the center of the insertion site was described relative to the borders of the tibial plateau and the retrospinal surface., RESULTS: The surface area of the femoral insertion measured 232 mm(-2) and was centered 8.9 mm from the roof of the intercondylar notch and 18.7 mm from the anterior articular cartilage surface. The surface area of the tibial insertion was 155 mm(2) and was centered 9.1 mm from the posterior border of the tibia on the retrospinal surface, 1.6 mm inferior to the plane of the tibial articular surface. This point was on average 49% of the way across the plateau relative to the medial edge of the plateau and 87% of the way across the plateau relative to the anterior edge., CONCLUSIONS: Computed tomography can provide detailed localization of the PCL attachment sites on the femur and tibia.

3357,"Chronic Actinic Dermatitis: a Review. Purpose of Review: To update readers on the current understandings of chronic actinic dermatitis (CAD) in regard to epidemiology, clinical findings, pathophysiology, treatment, and prognosis. Recent Findings: CAD is classically thought to be primarily a disease of elderly Caucasian males, though recent evidence suggests that in skin of color, the disease manifests more often in younger females. Recent studies suggest the pathogenesis of CAD involves a type-IV hypersensitivity reaction, similar to allergic contact dermatitis. There is also evidence of resistance to UV-induced immunosuppression in these patients, similar to polymorphous light eruption (PMLE). Furthermore, a lower CD4/CD8 ratio on flow cytometry in CAD patients has been correlated with increased tissue burden of disease. Photoprotection remains a mainstay of treatment, though recent evidence suggests potential efficacy of tofacitinib or short courses of narrowband UVB phototherapy as treatment options. Summary: CAD is an immunologically mediated photodermatosis characterized by pruritic eczematous lesions of sun-exposed areas, most commonly seen in older Caucasian males. While the pathogenesis of the condition is not fully understood, a type-IV hypersensitivity reaction to UV-induced neoantigens is thought to play a role. Photoprotection remains the mainstay of treatment, though adjunctive treatments are rapidly emerging. Though considered a chronic condition, CAD tends to improve over time.Copyright © 2019, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.",Excluded
1439,"Correlation between hallux valgus angle and hallucal sesamoid position on meary radiographic incide. Background: Hallux valgus (HV) and sesamoid misalignment are usually linked. Some studies found no correlation between the stage of hallucal sesamoid subluxation and standard radiographic data usually used for quantifying the severity of the HV. Aim(s): This study evaluate the correlation between the apparent lateral deviation of the sesamoids on anteroposterior X-rays and their rotation on axial X-rays, then evaluates their relations with the severity of hallux valgus. Method(s): This monocentric retrospective study included feet of adult men and women with a HV angle (HVA) superior to 15 degrees. Two independent doctors made the measurement of the relative displacement of the sesamoids on anteroposterior radiographies by using the 7 grades Clapham-and-Hardy classification and compared it with their rotation in axial radiographies, defined by the sesamoid rotation angle and the tibia sesamoid grade on modified Meary incidence with radio-transparent heelpiece. Correlation with the HV severity was analyzed based on measure of HVA and first intermetatarsal angle. Result(s): 303 feet were included (201 patients). All parameters shown significant correlations between each other. SRA appeared to be the most reliable criteria on Me ary radiography to evaluate the relative lateral displacement of sesamoids and it was the most strongly correlated to the HVA (0.658). Conclusion(s): An anteroposterior radiographic incidence is not sufficient to evaluate sesamoids subluxation. To approach at best the triplanar deformity of the metatarso-sesamoid complex, an evaluation in frontal and axial incidence is necessary. SRA appears as reliable criteria and could be used to evaluate the quality of the corrective surgery.",Excluded
1487,"Medically inoperable peripheral lung cancer treated with stereotactic body radiation therapy. BACKGROUND: Lung cancer is the most frequent cause of cancer-related death in North America. There is wide variation between patients who are medically inoperable and those managed surgically. The use of stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) has narrowed the gap in survival rates between operative and non-operative management for those with early stage disease. This retrospective study reports outcomes for the treatment of peripheral non-small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC) with SBRT from a single community practice., METHODS: Sixty-seven consecutive patients (pts) with inoperable, untreated peripheral lung tumors were treated from 2010 through 2012 and included in this study. Stereotactic targeting was facilitated by either spine or lung-based image guidance, either with or without fiducial marker tracking with a frameless robotic radiosurgery system. Peripheral tumors received a median biological effective dose (BED) of 105.6 Gy10 or in terms of a median physical dose, 48 Gy delivered over 4 daily fractions. Survival was measured using the Kaplan-Meier method to determine rates of local control, progression of disease and overall survival. The Cox proportional hazards regression model was used to study the effects of tumor size, stage, histology, patient age, tumor location (lobe), tracking method, and BED on the survival distributions., RESULTS: The median follow-up for this cohort was 24.5 months (range: 2.4-50.3) with an overall (OS) 3-year survival of 62.4 % (95 % CI: 74.3-47.3). The median progression-free survival was 28.5 months (95 % CI: 15.8 months to not reached). Local control (LC), defined as a lack of FDG uptake on PET/CT or the absence of tumor growth was achieved in 60 patients (90.9 %) at the time of first follow-up (median 3 months, range: 1-6). Local control at one year for the entire cohort was 81.8 % (95 % CI, 67.3-90.3). The one-year OS probability among those who achieved local control at first follow-up was 86.2 % (95 % CI, 74.3-92.9) but no patients who did not achieve LC at first follow-up survived one year. Of the 60 pts that achieved initial LC, 16 have died. The rates of local control, progression-free survival and overall survival were not statistically different for patients treated using a fiducial target tracking system versus non-invasive guidance. (p = 0.44, p = 0.97 and p = 0.66, respectively). No National Cancer Institute (NCI) Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE-4) grade 3 or greater toxicity was observed., CONCLUSION: SBRT is an effective treatment for medically inoperable NSCLC patients with peripherally located tumors. This therapy appears to be well tolerated with low toxicity, and patient outcomes when using non-invasive tumor tracking systems are not inferior to traditional fiducial-based techniques.",Excluded

2250,"Investigation of the antibacterial effect of laser irradiation and chemical agent on human oral biofilms contaminated titanium discs. Introduction: A main challenge in treatment of peri-implant disease is the effective decontamination of the implant surface. This challenge has always been a problem, associated with the treatment of these diseases with regard to the difficulty in removing and eliminating bacterial biofilm from the surface of dental implants, especially rough surfaces. The aim of this in-vivo study was to evaluate the effect of five different antimicrobial methods in reducing bacteria adhering to titanium surfaces. Material(s) and Method(s): In the present in-vivo study, the contaminated discs, except for the negative control group, randomly underwent one of five treatments: Erbium: Yattrium Aluminum Garnet (Er-YAG) laser, plastic curette, 0.12% chlorhexidine, aPDT, and 810 nm diode laser. A pectrophotometer was used to measure Optical Density (OD) in case of aerobic microorganisms. Colony-Forming Units (CFUs) were used for anaerobic bacteria. Then, all the analyses were carried out at a significance level of alpha = 0.05 through SPSS software. Finding(s): One-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) of aerobic bacteria showed a significant difference among 6 groups in terms of OD variations during a 0-24 h time interval (P < 0.001). The results of Kruskal-Wallis test were used to investigate the effect of study methods on anaerobic bacteria after 48 h, and the results showed a significant difference among 6 groups in terms of CFUs (P < 0.001).

We evaluated the safety and efficacy of carbon ion radiotherapy (CIRT) in LA-NSCLC patients., METHODS: Patients with stage IIA to IIIA (UICC 7th edition) LA-NSCLC were enrolled in a sequential phase I/II trial. For a phase I dose escalation study, the total prescribed dose was increased by 4 Gray equivalents (GyE) in 2 steps, from 68 to 72 GyE and then to 76 GyE, using 16 fractions over 4 weeks. After determining the recommended dose, the phase II trial was started in an expanded cohort., RESULTS: Of the 36 patients treated in phase I, 2 grade 3 adverse events (radiation pneumonitis and tracheoesophageal fistula) were observed in the 76 GyE group. Accordingly, for phase II, the next consecutive 26 patients were treated with 72 GyE, with no grade 3 to 5 toxicities resulting. A total of 62 eligible patients were recruited. The majority of patients (49 of 62) were N0 or N1 patients, and the rest (13 of 62) were single-station N2 patients. The median follow-up period was 25.2 months. The 2-year local control rate (LCR) and overall survival (OS) for the entire cohort were 93.1% and 51.9%, respectively. In particular, patients with cT3-4N0 had an excellent prognosis; the 2-year OS and LCR were 69.3% and 100%, respectively., CONCLUSIONS: Short-course CIRT monotherapy shows promise as an effective nonsurgical treatment for inoperable LA-NSCLC.

2553,"Cancer control knowledge and priorities among primary care physicians. Primary care physicians can play a key role in prevention and early detection of cancer. To assess cancer control knowledge and priorities among primary care physicians in Missouri, we conducted a random survey of 207 physicians. Although reported knowledge of the role tobacco plays in cancer causation was high, activity in tobacco cessation counselling and referral was low. Respondents considered diet to be a relatively unimportant factor in cancer causation, whereas they viewed sun exposure, genetics/family history, and radiation exposure as large contributors to the cancer burden. Among cancer early detection tests, high activity was shown for the Pap test and breast examination. Conversely, low activity was reported for colon sigmoidoscopy. Inverse correlations were shown between age group of the physician and several cancer prevention and early detection practices. For each cancer prevention and screening practice, reported activity was higher for medical doctors than for doctors of osteopathic medicine. Possible barriers or controversies in cancer control included disagreement with the current recommendation for Pap testing, the cost of mammography, and patient fear of sigmoidoscopy. These findings suggest that primary care physicians are not achieving their full potential in cancer control and indicate areas where increased emphasis is warranted.",Excluded

1313,"Predictive value of secondary signs of obstruction in follow-up computed tomography of ureteral stones: a study with dynamic computed tomography. OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to determine the ratio of obstruction and predictive values of secondary signs in follow-up computed tomography (CT) of ureterolithiasis patients; to correlate stone characteristics with obstruction; to compare enhancement of obstructed and non-obstructed kidneys; and to compare radiation dose of the dynamic CT protocol to an excretory-phase protocol., MATERIALS AND METHODS: This retrospective study assessed 49 follow-up CT scans of patients with remaining ureterolithiasis after a renal colic episode. Obstruction was measured as time taken to excretion of contrast medium in dynamic CT. Degree of secondary signs of obstruction was evaluated from the unenhanced CT. Data were collected on patients' gender and age, stone size and location, time from renal colic to follow-up, attenuation of the renal cortex and radiation dose., RESULTS: Obstruction was present in 28% (n = 14) at follow-up. Predictive values (sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value) were calculated for hydronephrosis (1.0, 0.63, 0.52, 1.0), hydroureter (1.0, 0.4, 0.4, 1.0), perirenal stranding (0.21, 0.94, 0.6, 0.75), Gerota's fascia (0.21, 0.97, 0.75, 0.76) and renal swelling (0.21, 0.97, 0.75, 0.76). Obstruction was not correlated with stone characteristics. Enhancement was lower in obstructed kidneys (p < 0.01). Radiation dose was reduced by 43% (1.8 mSv)., CONCLUSIONS: Obstruction was found in 28% of patients. Secondary signs were scarce and of indeterminate value to the diagnosis of obstruction. The absence of hydronephrosis and hydroureter contradicted obstruction. Stone characteristics were not correlated with obstruction. Enhancement of the renal cortex was lower in obstructed kidneys. The dynamic protocol reduced the radiation dose.",Excluded
3292,"Clinical outcomes of definitive chemoradiotherapy using carboplatin and paclitaxel in esophageal cancer. Patients with nonmetastatic esophageal cancer not suitable for surgery can be treated with definitive chemoradiotherapy with curative intent. The purpose of this retrospective study is to evaluate the clinical outcomes of definitive chemoradiotherapy using carboplatin and paclitaxel. Medical records were reviewed of patients treated for nonmetastatic squamous cell or adenocarcinoma of the esophagus between January 2009 and December 2013 in two collaborating institutes. Treatment consisted of external beam radiotherapy (28 fractions of 1.8 Gy) and 6 weekly courses of carboplatin (AUC = 2) and paclitaxel (50 mg/m2). Data on survival, progression, toxicity, and effect on dysphagia were recorded. Sixty-six patients were included. Median overall survival (OS) was 13.1 months (95% CI 4.7-21.5 months) and a 2-year OS was 30% (95% CI 18%-42%). At 2 years, 26% of patients developed local progression (95% CI 15%-37%) and 49% developed distant metastases (95% CI 36%-64%). Acute toxicity grade >=3 was observed in 47% of patients. Late adverse events grade >=3 were seen in 20%, mostly esophageal stenoses. Of patients with available data 3 months after treatment, 70% had relief of dysphagia. Definitive chemoradiotherapy led to a median OS of 13 months. Toxicity was common, mostly due to hematological toxicity. Given the relatively short median survival, an adequate selection of patients for this intensive treatment is required.Copyright © The Authors 2017.

1859,"Dual-source versus 64-section CT coronary angiography at lower heart rates: comparison of accuracy and radiation dose. PURPOSE: To compare the diagnostic performance and radiation doses of dual-source and 64-section computed tomographic (CT) coronary angiography for the diagnosis of significant coronary stenoses in patients with heart rates of 65 beats/min or less., MATERIALS AND METHODS: This retrospective study had local ethics committee approval; all patients gave written informed consent. Two hundred patients with heart rates of 65 beats/min or less were enrolled; 100 underwent dual-source and 100 underwent 64-section CT coronary angiography. Two blinded observers independently assessed image quality of all coronary segments by using a four-point scale and searched for significant (>50%) stenoses in each segment. Catheter angiography was used as the reference standard. Image noise was measured in the ascending aorta. Radiation doses were calculated., RESULTS: No significant differences were found regarding sex, age, body weight, cardiovascular risk profile, prevalence of stenosis, mean and variability of heart rate, Agatston score, and image noise (all P > .1) between patients in both CT coronary angiography groups. No significant difference was found in the rate of nonassessable coronary segments between dual-source (1.0%, 14 of 1405) and 64-section CT coronary angiography (1.8%, 25 of 1387; P = .08). Motion artifacts occurred significantly more often in 64-section (21 of 25) versus dual-source (five of 14, P = .004) CT coronary angiography. Segment-based accuracy and specificity were significantly higher for dual-source versus 64-section CT coronary angiography. There was no significant difference in accuracy parameters at the per-vessel and per-patient analyses. No significant difference (P = .13) was found between the effective doses of dual-source (mean +/- standard deviation, 10.9 mSv +/- 1.1) and 64-section CT (10.4 mSv +/- 1.7) coronary angiography., CONCLUSION: In patients with heart rates of 65 beats/min or less, the higher temporal resolution of dual-source CT coronary angiography results in improved accuracy and specificity for the diagnosis of significant stenoses on a per-segment level at a similar radiation dose, but provides a comparable diagnostic accuracy on a patient-based level as does 64-section coronary angiography.",Excluded

3623,"Weight-adapted iodinated contrast media administration in abdomino-pelvic CT: Can image quality be maintained?. Introduction In many centres, a fixed method of contrast-media administration is used for CT regardless of patient body habitus. The aim of this trial was to assess contrast enhancement of the aorta, portal vein, liver and spleen during abdomino-pelvic CT imaging using a weight-adapted contrast media protocol compared to the current fixed dose method. Methods Thirty-nine oncology patients, who had previously undergone CT abdomino-pelvic imaging at the institution using a fixed contrast media dose, were prospectively imaged using a weight-adapted contrast media dose (1.4 ml/kg). The two sets of images were assessed for contrast enhancement levels (HU) at locations in the liver, aorta, portal vein and spleen during portal-venous enhancement phase. The t-test was used to compare the difference in results using a non-inferiority margin of 10 HU. Results When the contrast dose was tailored to patient weight, contrast enhancement levels were shown to be non-inferior to the fixed dose method (liver p < 0.001; portal vein p = 0.003; aorta p = 0.001; spleen p = 0.001). As a group, patients received a total contrast dose reduction of 165 ml using the weight-adapted method compared to the fixed dose method, with a mean cost per patient of 6.81 and 7.19 respectively. Conclusion Using a weight-adapted method of contrast media administration was shown to be non-inferior to a fixed dose method of contrast media administration. Patients weighing 76 kg, or less, received a lower contrast dose which may have associated cost savings. A weight-adapted contrast media protocol should be implemented for portal-venous phase abdomino-pelvic CT for oncology patients with adequate renal function (>70 ml/min/1.73 m2).Copyright © 2017",Excluded
2570,"Neoadjuvant chemotherapy plus intensity-modulated radiotherapy versus concurrent chemoradiotherapy plus adjuvant chemotherapy for the treatment of locoregionally advanced nasopharyngeal carcinoma: A retrospective controlled study. Background: In the era of intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT), the role of neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) for locoregionally advanced nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) is under-evaluated. The aim of this study was to compare the efficacy of NAC plus IMRT and concurrent chemoradiotherapy (CCRT) plus adjuvant chemotherapy (AC) on locoregionally advanced NPC. Method(s): Between January 2004 and December 2008, 240 cases of locoregionally advanced NPC confirmed by pathologic assessment in Sun Yat-sen University Cancer Center were reviewed. Of the 240 patients, 117 received NAC followed by IMRT, and 123 were treated with CCRT plus AC. The NAC + IMRT group received a regimen that included cisplatin and 5-fluorouracil (5-FU). The CCRT + AC group received cisplatin concurrently with radiotherapy, and subsequently received adjuvant cisplatin and 5-FU. The survival rates were assessed by Kaplan-Meier analysis, and the survival curves were compared using a log-rank test. Multivariate analysis was conducted using the Cox proportional hazard regression model. Result(s): The 5-year overall survival (OS), locoregional relapse-free survival (LRRFS), distant metastasis-free survival (DMFS), and disease-free survival (DFS) were 78.0, 87.9, 79.0, and 69.8%, respectively, for the NAC + IMRT group and 78.7, 84.8, 76.2, and 65.6%, respectively, for the CCRT + AC group. There were no significant differences in survival between the two groups. In multivariate analysis, age (<50 years vs. >=50 years) and overall stage (III vs. IV) were found to be independent predictors for OS and DFS; furthermore, the overall stage was a significant prognostic factor for DMFS. Compared with the CCRT + AC protocol, the NAC + IMRT protocol significantly reduced the occurrence rates of grade 3-4 nausea-vomiting (6.5 vs. 1.5%, P = 0.023) and leukopenia (9.7 vs. 0.8%, P = 0.006). Conclusion(s): The treatment outcomes of the NAC + IMRT and CCRT + AC groups were similar. Distant metastasis remained the predominant mode of treatment failure.Copyright © 2016 Qiu et al.",Excluded
2604,"Relation between quantitative coronary CTA and myocardial ischemia by adenosine stress myocardial CT perfusion. Background: Coronary-computed tomography angiography (CTA) has limited accuracy to predict myocardial ischemia. Besides luminal area stenosis, other coronary plaque morphology and composition parameters may help to assess ischemia. With the integration of coronary CTA and adenosine stress CT myocardial perfusion (CTP), reliable information regarding coronary anatomy and function can be derived in one procedure. This analysis aimed to investigate the association between coronary stenosis severity, plaque composition and morphology and the presence of ischemia measured with adenosine stress myocardial CTP. Methods and Results: 84 patients (age, 62 +/- 10 years; 48% men) who underwent sequential coronary CTA and adenosine stress myocardial CT perfusion were analyzed. Automated quantification was performed in all coronary lesions (quantitative CTA). Downstream myocardial ischemia was assessed by visual analysis of the rest and stress CTP images and defined as a summed difference score of >=1. One or more coronary plaques were present in 146 coronary arteries of which 31 (21%) were ischemia-related. Of the lesions with a stenosis percentage <50%, 50%-70%, and >70%, respectively, 9% (6/67), 18% (9/51), and 57% (16/28) demonstrated downstream ischemia. Furthermore, mean plaque burden, plaque volume, lesion length, maximal plaque thickness, and dense calcium volume were significantly higher in ischemia-related lesions, but only stenosis severity (%) (OR 1.06; 95% CI 1.02-1.10; P = .006) and lesion length (mm) (OR 1.26; 95% CI 1.02-1.55; P = .029) were independent correlates. Conclusion(s): Increasing stenosis percentage by quantitative CTA is positively correlated to myocardial ischemia measured with adenosine stress myocardial CTP. However, stenosis percentage remains a moderate determinant. Lumen area stenosis and lesion length were independently associated with ischemia, adjusted for coronary plaque volume, mean plaque burden, maximal lesion thickness, and dense calcium volume.Copyright © 2016, The Author(s).",Excluded
3621,"Knowledge and risk perception among nuclear power plant employees. This is a study of knowledge, risk perception, and attitudes among nuclear power plant employees. A total of 236 persons participated, belonging to 10 different professional groups and working at two Swedish power plants. Job-related radiation risks were judged about average as compared to a number of other risks. On the whole, the participants in the study were satisfied with the measures of safety at work, but there were some exceptions to this rule, especially among those hired for temporary jobs through external contractors. The experience of job-related radiation risks was related to the level of knowledge about radiation and its risks: those who knew less experienced larger risks. General level of anxiety did not correlate with risk perception. The latter was accounted for mainly by perceived radiation risks. Job satisfaction was more strongly related to perceived conventional job risks than to nuclear risks. Risk ratings were related to how subjects defined the concept of risk. Those who stressed consequences as part of their risk definition gave higher risk ratings.",Excluded

642,"Idiopathic pulmonary artery aneurysm: A case report of a rare disease. INTRODUCTION: Pulmonary artery aneurysm (PAA) is defined as dilation of the proximal pulmonary artery or one of its branches. It is difficult to diagnose and often is an autopsy finding. It is classified as central, which arises from the main pulmonary artery, or peripheral, which arises from segmental or sub-segmental arteries. Pulmonary hypertension is an important risk factor for development and rupture of PAA. We present a case of idiopathic PAA which has remained stable for past 10 years. CASE PRESENTATION: A 32 year old male with a history of PAA presented to the ER with complaints of atypical chest pain. Physical exam findings and laboratory studies were unremarkable. Contrast-enhanced CT scan of the chest revealed aneurysmal dilation of the right pulmonary artery with a clot in it. This was compared to multiple previous CT scans and did not show any changes. Review of past records revealed that 10 years ago, the patient was admitted for similar complaints, found to have a right hilar mass on X-ray and chest CT suspicious for neoplasm. Thoracotomy was done for biopsy and patient was found to have a 4x3 cm right PAA. Echocardiography showed normal pulmonary artery pressure. On this visit VQ scan was done which was negative for pulmonary embolism. Patient was discharged after 2 days with outpatient follow-up. DISCUSSION: PAA is a rare condition with an incidence of 1 in 14,000 autopsies. Unlike aortic aneurysm it has equal prevalence in both genders and occurs in younger patients. The likely pathology seems to be increased hemodynamic stresses combined with underlying vessel wall weakness. It is commonly associated with congenital heart defects (shunts, PDA or VSD), pulmonary artery hypertension and connective tissue disorders such as Marfan's syndrome and infections like syphilis and TB. It typically presents with hemoptysis, chest pain, cough and/or dyspnea but is also not infrequently discovered as an incidental finding. The advent of contrast-enhanced CT, MRI and echocardiograms have assumed a primary role in diagnosis. Complications may include pulmonary hypertension, thrombus formation, bronchial compression or aneurysmal rupture. Management is surgical coupled with treatment of the underlying disorders. CONCLUSION(S): Controversy still exists regarding indications for surgical management, with some pursuing conservative approach while others in favor of surgical intervention even in asymptomatic patients. One third of the patients die from rupture of the aneurysm emphasizing the need for follow up and prompt intervention if it enlarges or become symptomatic. Therefore, close follow-up is required.",Excluded

Introduction: We compared clinical outcomes in patients with cutaneous angiosarcoma receiving concurrent paclitaxel-based chemoradiotherapy (CRT) vs. other modalities (Non-CRT). Material(s) and Method(s): Patients with non-metastatic cutaneous angiosarcoma diagnosed from 1998 to 2018 at two institutions were identified. In the CRT cohort, paclitaxel 80 mg/m2 weekly was given for up to 12 weeks and patients received radiotherapy (RT) during the final 6 weeks of chemotherapy. The RT dose was 50-50.4 Gy delivered in 1.8-2 Gy per fraction with an optional post-operative boost of 10-16 Gy. Kaplan-Meier and log-rank statistics were used to compare the outcomes between the two groups. P < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Result(s): Fifty-seven patients were included: 22 CRT and 35 Non-CRT. The CRT cohort had more patients > 60 years (100% vs. 60%, p < 0.001) and tumors >5 cm (68.2% vs 54.3%, p = 0.023). The median follow-up was 25.8 (1.5-155.2) months. There was no significant difference in 2-year local control (LC), distant control (DC), or progression-free survival (PFS) between the two groups. The 2-year overall survival (OS) was significantly higher for the CRT cohort (94.1% vs. 71.6%, p = 0.033). Amongst the subset of patients in the CRT cohort who received trimodality therapy, the 2-year LC, DC, PFS, and OS was 68.6%, 100%, 68.6%, and 100%, respectively. Conclusion(s): The use of concurrent paclitaxel CRT demonstrates promising outcomes. Given these results, we are currently evaluating the safety and efficacy of this regimen in prospective, phase 2 trial (NCT 03921008).Copyright © 2021 The Authors",Excluded

Objective: To explore the association between idiopathic pneumonia syndrome (IPS) and acute graft-versus-host disease (aGVHD) in allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. Method(s): Established acute GVHD model of C57BL/6 -> BALB/c mice. Chest computed tomography (CT) scans were dynamically performed in recipient mice after transplant. Lung histopathology and cytokine levels (including TNF-alpha and IFN-gamma) were examined in three experimental groups: mice receiving simple irradiation, syngeneic transplants, and allogeneic transplants. Result(s): All allogeneic transplant mice developed aGVHD. On CT, most aGVHD mice had bilateral diffuse lung infiltrates, while syngeneic transplant mice had normal lungs. On histopathology, aGVHD mice had acute pneumonitis. On immunohistochemistry, the infiltrates were mainly CD4+ T cells during aGVHD onset, but CD8+ T cells predominated during aGVHD progression. Lung TNF-alpha and IFN-gamma levels were higher in the three experimental groups than in normal controls on days + 3 and + 7 post-transplant. On day + 7, TNF-alpha levels were higher in allogeneic than in syngeneic transplant mice; IFN-gamma levels were not different. On days + 12 and + 16, TNF-alpha levels were higher but IFN-gamma levels were lower in allogeneic mice than in syngeneic transplant mice. Conclusion(s): The underlying cause of IPS is aGVHD. T cells and TNF-alpha may play a role in the pathogenesis of aGVHD-induced IPS. IPS progression may be associated with decreasing lung IFN-gamma levels. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.",Excluded
1228,"Platelet-rich plasma as a potential therapeutic approach against lead nitrate- and/or gamma radiation-induced hepatotoxicity. Because of the potential regenerative and cytoprotective effects of its content of numerous bioactive growth factors and cytokines, platelet-rich plasma (PRP) became an attractive biomaterial for therapeutic purposes. Therefore, the current study was designed to investigate the potential therapeutic effect of PRP against lead nitrate- and/or gamma-radiation-induced hepatotoxicity. To do so, hepatotoxicity was induced in rats by intraperitoneal administration of lead nitrate (7.5 mg/kg) thrice weekly for two consecutive weeks and/or a whole-body gamma-irradiation at a single dose of 6 Gy. Activated PRP (0.5 ml/kg) was injected subcutaneously 24 h after the last dose of lead nitrate and/or gamma-irradiation and continued twice weekly for three successive weeks. Lead nitrate intoxication and/or gamma-irradiation resulted in a significant elevation of serum alanine transaminase and aspartate transaminase activities accompanied with a significant decrease in serum levels of total protein and albumin. Further, a significant increase in malondialdehyde level and nitric oxide content accompanied with a significant decrease in the reduced glutathione content and the enzyme activities of glutathione-S-transferase, superoxide dismutase, and catalase were observed. Additionally, hepatic extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) and Akt signaling pathways were stimulated. PRP treatment notably ameliorated the induced cell injury, reduced the intracellular oxidative and interestingly increased the upregulation of phosphorylated ERK1/2 and Akt. Moreover, PRP treatment relieved lead nitrate and/or gamma-radiation-induced hepatic histological damages. In conclusion, this study sheds the light on a probable therapeutic role of PRP against lead nitrate- and/or gamma-radiation-induced hepatotoxicity which might attribute to its ability to activate ERK and Akt signaling pathways.",Excluded

3319,"Decreasing the dose of radioiodine for remnant ablation does not increase structural recurrence rates in papillary thyroid carcinoma. Background Our aim was to compare the rate of structural recurrence between patients who had lesser doses of radioactive iodine (RAI) and those who had traditional greater doses for remnant ablation after total thyroidectomy for papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC). Methods A retrospective cohort study of patients who had undergone thyroidectomy and RAI for PTC was undertaken. We divided the cohort into those who had <=3 GBq (75 mCi) RAI (group A) and those who had >3 GBq (75 mCi) RAI (group B). The primary outcome measure was the rate of structural recurrence. Results Of 1,171 patients with PTC from 1990 to 2012 who were followed for a mean of 60 months, 970 with T1-T3 tumors underwent RAI in addition to thyroidectomy. The mean first dose of RAI was 2.5 GBq (68 mCi) for group A (n = 153) and 4.7 GBq (127 mCi) for group B (n = 817; P <.001). The overall rate of recurrence was 8%. When corrected for T stage, the recurrence rates were not different for T1 tumors (2% group A versus 4% group B; P =.54) nor for T2 and T3 tumors (P =.36 and.55, respectively). On multivariate analysis, the dose of RAI was not an independent predictor for structural recurrence. Conclusion Decreasing the dose of RAI at initial ablation for patients with pT1-pT3 PTC does not seem to be associated with an increased risk of structural cancer recurrence. © 2013 Mosby, Inc.

2067,"Dependency of the interaural phase difference sensitivities of inferior collicular neurons on a preceding tone and its implications in neural population coding. This study examined the sensitivities of the neuronal responses in the inferior colliculus (IC) to the interaural phase difference (IPD) of a preceding tone, and explored its implications in the neural-population representation of the IPD. Single-unit responses were recorded from the IC of anesthetized gerbils. The stimulus was a dichotic tone sequence with a common frequency (typically the unit's best frequency) and level (10-20 dB relative to the threshold), consisting of a conditioner (200 ms) followed by a probe (50 ms) with a silent gap (5-100 ms) between them. The IPDs of the 2 tones were varied independently. The presence of a conditioner generally suppressed the probe-driven responses; the effect size increased as the conditioner IPD approached the unit's most responsive IPD. The units' preferred IPDs were relatively invariant with the conditioner IPD. Two types of models were used to evaluate the effects of a conditioner on the IPD representation at the level of IC neural population. One was a version of the population-vector model. The other was the hemispheric-channel model, which assumed that the stimulus IPD is represented by the activities of 2 broadly tuned hemispheric channels. Both models predicted that, in the presence of a conditioner, the IPD representation would shift in a direction away from the conditioner IPD. This appears to emphasize the difference between the conditioner and the probe IPDs. The results indicate that in the IC, neural processes for IPD adapt to the stimulus history to enhance the representational contrast between successive sounds.",Excluded

BACKGROUND: Percutaneous vertebroplasty (PVP) and percutaneous kyphoplasty (PKP) are widely used in the treatment of Kummell's disease. The purpose of this article is to investigate the clinical efficacy of PVP and PKP for Kummell's disease., METHODS: The clinical data that 56 cases of Kummell's disease treated with either PVP (28 cases) or PKP (28 cases) from December 2015 to December 2017 were prospectively analyzed. Gender, age, course of disease, injury segment, bone mineral density (BMD), visual analogue scale (VAS), Oswestry disability index (ODI), imaging measurement indexes before surgery between the two groups showed no significant difference (all P > 0.05). The bone cement leakage rate, bone cement injection amount, operation time, VAS, ODI, the rate of vertebral compression, correction rate of kyphosis and refracture rate of adjacent vertebra in 2 years were compared between the two groups to calculate clinical efficacy., RESULTS: The two groups were followed up for 24-48 months. There was no significant difference in the follow-up time, amount of bone cement injected, incidence of bone cement leakage and refracture rate of adjacent vertebrae between the two groups (all P > 0.05). The operation time, intraoperative blood loss and fluoroscopy times of the PVP group were significantly lower than those of the PKP group (all P = 0.000). VAS score and ODI of the two groups were significantly lower at 1 day, 1 year and 2 years after surgery than before surgery (all P < 0.05), but there was not statistically significant difference between the two groups at each time point after surgery (all P > 0.05). The rate of vertebral compression and kyphosis correction in the two groups were significantly corrected (P < 0.05, respectively) and decreased significantly with time (all P < 0.05), But there was not significant difference between the two groups at any time point (all P > 0.05)., CONCLUSION: Both PVP and PKP can achieve similar effects in the treatment of Kummell's disease. Because the cost, operation time, blood loss, radiation exposure and surgical procedure of PVP are less than those of PKP, PVP has more clinical priority value.",Excluded
37,"Improved clinical outcome in indolent B-cell lymphoma patients vaccinated with autologous tumor cells experiencing immunogenic death. Increasing evidence argues that the success of an anticancer treatment may rely on immunoadjuvant side effects including the induction of immunogenic tumor cell death. Based on the assumption that this death mechanism is a similar prerequisite for the efficacy of an active immunotherapy using killed tumor cells, we examined a vaccination strategy using dendritic cells (DC) loaded with apoptotic and necrotic cell bodies derived from autologous tumors. Using this approach, clinical and immunologic responses were achieved in 6 of 18 patients with relapsed indolent non - Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL). The present report illustrates an impaired ability of the neoplastic cells used to vaccinate nonresponders to undergo immunogenic death on exposure to a cell death protocol based on heat shock, gamma-ray, and UVC ray. Interestingly, when compared with doxorubicin, this treatment increased surface translocation of calreticulin and cellular release of high-mobility group box 1 and ATP in histologically distinct NHL cell lines. In contrast, treated lymphoma cells from responders displayed higher amounts of calreticulin and heat shock protein 90 (HSP90) compared with those from nonresponders and boosted the production of specific antibodies when loaded into DCs for vaccination. Accordingly, the extent of calreticulin and HSP90 surface expression in the DC antigenic cargo was significantly associated with the clinical and immunologic responses achieved. Our results indicate that a positive clinical effect is obtained when immunogenically killed autologous neoplastic cells are used for the generation of a DC-based vaccine. Therapeutic improvements may thus be accomplished by circumventing the tumor-impaired ability to undergo immunogenic death and prime the antitumor immune response. ©2010 AACR.",Excluded
2675,"Efficacy of X-ray stereotactic radiotherapy on brain metastases and prognostic analysis. Background and Objective: X-ray stereotactic radiotherapy (SRT) is one of the effective treatments for brain metastases (BM). This study was to evaluate the efficacy of SRT on BM, and investigate prognostic factors. Method(s): Between July 1999 and December 2004, a total of 122 Intracranial lesions In 78 patients with BM were treated using SRT in our Center. Forty-nine patients had a solitary lesion and 29 had multiple (2-6) lesions. The median SRT dose was 15 Gy (11-24 Gy) in single fraction for 38 lesions, and 24 Gy (11-40 Gy) in 2-6 fractions for 84 lesions. SRT was combined with whole brain radiotherapy (WBRT) of 30-40 Gy for 39 patients. Progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) were estimated by Kaplan-Meier method. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed by the log-rank test and Cox model, respectively. Result(s): The median survival time was 12.9 months (1.7-77.4 months). The 1-year intracranial PFS rate was 87.4%. The 1- and 2-year OS rates were 53.9% and 25.8%, respectively. Univariate analysis showed that the 1-year OS rates were higher In the patients with pretreatment KPS of s= 70, extracranial lesions controlled, or SRT combined with WBRT than in those with KPS of < 70 (60.7% vs. 29.4%, P = 0.002), extracranial lesions uncontrolled (69% vs. 44.9%, P = 0.005), or SRT alone (64.1% vs. 43.4%, P = 0.03). The benefit of treating with WBRT in combination was mainly achieved in the patients with extracranial lesions controlled or with more than one Intracranial lesion. Multivariate analysis showed that KPS score and status of extracranial lesions were independent prognostic factors for OS. Conclusion(s): SRT is an effective and safe modality for BM. SRT combined with WBRT may prolong the survival time of the patients with extracranial lesions controlled or multiple Intracranial lesions. Independent prognostic factors for OS are KPS score and status of extracranial lesions.",Excluded
1890,"The use of an air bubble curtain to reduce the received sound levels for harbor porpoises (Phocoena phocoena). In December 2005 construction work was started to replace a harbor wall in Kerteminde harbor, Denmark. A total of 175 wooden piles were piled into the ground at the waters edge over a period of 3 months. During the same period three harbor porpoises were housed in a marine mammal facility on the opposite side of the harbor. All animals showed strong avoidance reactions after the start of the piling activities. As a measure to reduce the sound exposure for the animals an air bubble curtain was constructed and operated in a direct path between the piling site and the opening of the animals' semi-natural pool. The sound attenuation effect achieved with this system was determined by quantitative comparison of pile driving impulses simultaneously measured in front of and behind the active air bubble curtain. Mean levels of sound attenuation over a sequence of 95 consecutive pile strikes were 14 dB (standard deviation (s.d.) 3.4 dB) for peak to peak values and 13 dB (s.d. 2.5 dB) for SEL values. As soon as the air bubble curtain was installed and operated, no further avoidance reactions of the animals to the piling activities were apparent.",Excluded
1559,"Visualization of subsurface structures in cells and tissues by backscattered electron imaging. A fraction of the beam electrons which interact with a specimen scatter back. The number of backscattered electrons (BE's) increases with the atomic number of the elements encountered. Cell and tissue structures lacking a heavy metal content yield few BE's compared to structures affixed with heavy metals, either vitally or by means of staining methods applied after fixation. The BE imaging mode of a scanning electron microscope (SEM) provides an intensity map of the BE yield from the specimen. BE imaging of selectively stained structures in cells and tissues renders these structures visible in contrast to the unstained surround. Since BE's can emerge from a significant depth within the material, BE imaging can be used to view such heavy metal stained structures beneath intact cell surfaces. The microcontours of the overlying surface can be viewed concurrently by using the surface scanning (i.e., the secondary electron imaging; SEI) mode of the microscope. Methods for selectively contrasting subsurface structures can be adapted from existing light microscope (LM) and transmission electron microscope (TEM) methods. Staining methods have been devised for subsurface viewing of cell organelles, including nuclei, mitochondria, peroxisomes, lysosomes, and phagosomes. A physical model is presented which describes these observations and suggests future possible trends in this subject. Specifically the image contrast and resolution are described in terms of the physical properties of the stain and specimen and of the SEM operating conditions of energy and current. Finally a summary of instrumentation considerations describes present and potential BE detectors, their ancillary electronics, and image processing.",Excluded

PURPOSE: To evaluate the efficacy and safety of carbon-ion radiation therapy (RT) for mucosal melanoma of the head and neck (MMHN) in the Japan Carbon-Ion Radiation Oncology Study Group study., METHODS AND MATERIALS: Patients with MMHN with N0-1M0 status who were treated with carbon-ion RT at 4 institutions in Japan between November 2003 and December 2014 were analyzed retrospectively. Two hundred sixty patients (male, 111; female, 149; median age, 68 years) with histologically proven MMHN were enrolled., RESULTS: Primary sites included the nasal cavity in 178 patients, paranasal sinuses in 43, oral cavity in 27, and pharynx in 12. Eighty-six patients had T3 tumors, 147 had T4a tumors, and 27 had T4b tumors. Two hundred fifty-one patients were diagnosed with N0 disease, and 9 with N1 disease. The median total dose and number of fractions were 57.6 Gy RBE (relative biological effectiveness) and 16, respectively. Chemotherapy including dimethyl traizeno imidazole carboxamide was used concurrently in 129 patients. The median follow-up duration was 22 months (range, 1-132 months). The 2-year overall survival and local control rates were 69.4% and 83.9%, respectively. Multivariate analysis showed that gross tumor volume and concurrent chemotherapy were significant prognostic factors for overall survival. Grade 3 and grade 4 late morbidities were observed in 27 and 7 patients (5 developed ipsilateral blindness, 1 mucosal ulcer, and 1 second malignant disease in the irradiated volume), respectively.

Background: Pneumocystis pneumonia (PCP) is an emerging infectious disease in immunocompromised hosts. However, the clinical characteristics of these patients are poorly understood in mainland China. Method(s): We performed a retrospective study of PCP from 2008 to 2012. Information was collected regarding clinical manifestations, hospitalization, and outcome. A prognostic analysis was performed using a Cox regression model. Result(s): 151 cases of PCP were included; 46 non-HIV and 105 HIV cases. All-cause mortality (15.2% vs. 12.4%, p = 0.64) and the results of time-to-event analysis (log-rank test, p = 0.62) were similar between non-HIV and HIV infected cases, respectively. From 2008 to 2012, time from admission to initial treatment in non-HIV infected PCP patients showed declining trend [median (range) 20 (9-44) vs. 12 (4-24) vs. 9 (2-23) vs. 7 (2-22) vs. 7 (1-14) days]. A similar trend was observed for all-cause mortality (33.3% vs. 20.0% vs.14.3% vs. 14.3% vs. 6.7%).

3093,"Personal UV exposure for different outdoor sports. Exposure to ultraviolet (UV) radiation is a major environmental risk factor in the development of skin cancers and it occurs mainly during outdoor activities. The purpose of this study is to quantify the UV exposure suffered by amateur athletes (tennis players, hikers and runners) in their training schedules. The study on tennis player exposure took place at a tennis club in Valencia during the month of June 2011. With respect to the hiking group, the hikes studied took place in several mountainous areas of Spain and France from June to August 2011. Finally, the exposure suffered by ten runners while participating in a running circuit in the province of Valencia, from March to November 2011, was studied. The athletes were monitored using personal dosimeters (VioSpor), with the tennis players and runners wearing them on the wrist and the hikers on the shoulder. The median daily personal UV exposure for the hikers was 8.1 Standard Erythema Dose (SED) and for the tennis players 7.5 SED per day of training. The runners received a median of 14.6 SED while participating in the running circuit and about 2 SED per competition day. Median daily UV exposure of the hikers and tennis players exceeded 5 SED, which means that, in the case of non-sun-adapted skin type III and the non-use of sun protection, erythema may be induced in these subjects. However, the exposure suffered by the runners did not exceed the maximum personal exposure of 5 SED. Accordingly, it is necessary to encourage the use of high protection sunscreens and protective clothing and to avoid UV exposure in the hottest part of the day.",Excluded

PURPOSE: There is little published data on the technique and results of whole-field (WF) sequential intensity-modulated radiotherapy (S-IMRT) for patients with head-and-neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC). We report the treatment outcomes, adverse events (AEs), and dosimetric parameters in local-regional advanced (LRA) HNSCC patients treated with the WF S-IMRT technique., METHODS: The IRB approved this retrospective study. Patients received WF S-IMRT with or without concomitant chemotherapy. Three separate IMRT plans corresponding to 3 planning target volumes were generated. This study reports patient and tumor characteristics, treatment-induced acute AEs based on CTCAE version 3.0, chronic AEs according to RTOG scale and treatment outcomes, local-regional control (LRC), distant metastases (DM), relapse-free survival (RFS), and overall survival (OS)., RESULTS: Between January 2003 and December 2010, 103 patients with LRA HNSCC were treated either definitively or postoperatively with WF S-IMRT, with (99 patients) or without (4 patients) concurrent chemotherapy. The median age was 55 years (range, 30 to 89 y). The median cumulative target dose was 70 Gy (range, 60 to 75 Gy). At a median follow-up of 40 months (range, 4 to 95 mo), the 2- and 5-year rates of OS were 94% and 77%, RFS were 90% and 84%, LRC were 97% and 93%, and DM were 9% and 11%, respectively.

1952,"Size-specific dose estimates for chest, abdominal, and pelvic CT: Effect of intrapatient variability in water-equivalent diameter. Purpose: To develop software to automatically calculate size-specific dose estimates (SSDEs) and to assess the effect of variations in water-equivalent diameter (Dw) along the z-axis on SSDE for computed tomographic (CT) examinations of the torso. Material(s) and Method(s): In this institutional review board-approved, HIPAA-compliant, retrospective study, a software program was used to calculate Dw at each image position in 102 consecutive CT examinations of the combined chest, abdomen, and pelvis. SSDE was calculated by multiplying the size-dependent conversion factor and volume CT dose index (CTDIvol) at each image position. The variations in Dw along the z-axis were determined for six hypothetical scanning ranges: chest alone; abdomen alone; pelvis alone; chest and abdomen; abdomen and pelvis; and chest, abdomen, and pelvis. Mean SSDE was calculated in two ways: (a) from the SSDE at each position and (b) from the mean CTDIvol over each scan range and the conversion factor corresponding to Dw at the middle of the scan range. Linear regression analysis was performed to determine the correlation between SSDE values calculated in these two ways. Result(s): Across patients, for scan ranges 1-6, the mean of the difference between maximal and minimal Dw within a given patient was 5.2, 4.9, 2.5, 6.0, 5.6, and 6.5 cm, respectively. The mean SSDE values calculated by using the two methods were in close agreement, with root mean square differences of 0.9, 0.5, 0.5, 1.4, 1.0, and 1.1 mGy or 6%, 3%, 2%, 9%, 4%, and 6%, for the scan ranges of chest; abdomen; pelvis; chest and abdomen; abdomen and pelvis; and chest, abdomen, and pelvis, respectively. Conclusion(s): Using the mean CTDIvol from the whole scan range and Dw from the image at the center of the scan range provided an easily obtained estimate of SSDE for the whole scan range that agreed well with values from an image-by-image approach, with a root mean square difference less than 1.4 mGy (9%).Copyright © RSNA, 2015.",Excluded
393,"The prognostic significance of the treatment response of regional lymph nodes and the refinement of the current TNM staging system in locally advanced rectal cancer after neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy. The current TNM staging system uses the same category definitions for both rectal cancer patients with and without neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy (NCRT). However, ypTNM stage, especially ypN stage does not predict patient survival after NCRT well. Whether tumor regression in lymph nodes (LRG) may improve the prediction has not been well studied. In total, 358 patients with rectal cancer who received NCRT followed by radical resection were recruited from 2004 to 2015, and the median follow-up time was 57.5 months. The main outcome measure was disease-free survival (DFS). In univariate analysis, factors associated with DFS were ypT stage, ypN stage, number of negative lymph nodes (NLN), lymph node ratio (LNR), tumor regression grade (TRG), M-TTRG (modified ypT stage by combining ypT stage and TRG), maximum LRG (LRGmax), sum score of LRG (LRGsum), LRG ratio (average value of LRGsum), and M-NLRG (modified ypN stage by combining LRGmax and LNR). In the multivariate Cox regression analysis, M-TTRG and M-NLRG (p < 0.001 and p = 0.030, respectively) were significantly associated with DFS. The estimated 5-year DFS rates were 86.6%, 60.3%, and 36.4% for patients with M-NLRG-0, M-NLRG-1, and M-NLRG-2, respectively (p < 0.001). A significant difference in survival was observed among patients with NCRT after incorporating TRG and LRG simultaneously into the current ypTNM staging system (p < 0.001). LRG was an important prognostic factor in rectal cancer patients treated with NCRT and could refine the ypTNM staging system. The modified ypTNM staging system in combination with LRGmax, LNR, and TRG could improve the DFS prediction in each subset of patients.Copyright © 2020 The Authors.

Ultrasound-guided percutaneous core needle biopsy (USPCB) is used extensively in daily clinical practice for the pathologic confirmation of both focal and diffuse diseases of the abdominal viscera. As a guidance tool, US has a number of clear advantages over computerized tomography or magnetic resonance imaging: fewer false-negative biopsies, lack of ionizing radiation, portability, relatively short procedure time, real-time intra-procedural visualization of the biopsy needle, ability to guide the procedure in almost any anatomic plane, and relatively lower cost. Notably, USPCB is widely used to retrieve tissue specimens in cases of hepatic lesions. However, general radiologists, particularly beginners, find USPCB difficult to perform in abdominal organs other than the liver; indeed, a full understanding of the entire USPCB process and specific considerations for specific abdominal organs is necessary to safely obtain adequate specimens. In this review, we discuss some points and techniques that need to be borne in mind to increase the chances of successful USPCB. We believe that the tips and considerations presented in this review will help radiologists perform USPCB to successfully retrieve target tissue from different organs with minimal complications.",Excluded

Following transurethral resection of bladder tumor (TURBT), 35 and 6 patients received intravesical instillations of bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) and anthracycline-derivants, respectively, whereas 15 received no adjuvant therapy. Five and 2 patients received systemic and local chemotherapy with irradiation, respectively, and six underwent radical cystectomy for invasive potential. The 5-year non-recurrence, progression-free, and overall (cancer-specific) survival rates were 66, 82%, and 76 (88) %, respectively, after a median follow-up of 52 months. The 5-year non-recurrence rates were 24% in non-adjuvant, 85% in BCG, 0% in anthracycline-derivants, 65% in systemic and local chemoradiation therapy, and 68% in cystectomy.

OBJECTIVE: The safety, efficacy, and morbidity of radiosurgery (RS) must be established before it can be offered as an alternative to open surgery for unilateral mesial temporal lobe epilepsy. We report the 3-year outcomes of a multicenter, prospective pilot study of RS., METHODS: RS was randomized to 20 or 24Gy targeting the amygdala, hippocampus, and parahippocampal gyrus. Seizure diaries evaluated the final seizure remission between months 24 and 36. Verbal memory was evaluated at baseline and 24m with the Wechsler Memory Scale-Revised (WMS-R) and California Verbal Learning Test (CVLT). Patients were classified as having ""significant improvement,"" ""no change,"" and ""significant impairment"" based on relative change indices., RESULTS: Thirteen high-dose and 17 low-dose patients were treated. Both groups showed significant reductions in seizures by 1 year after treatment. At the 36-month follow-up evaluation, 67% of patients were free of seizures for the prior 12 months (high dose: 10/13, 76.9%; low dose: 10/17, 58.8%). Use of steroids, headaches, and visual field defects did not differ by dose or seizure remission. The prevalence of verbal memory impairment was 15% (4/26 patients); none declined on more than one measure. The prevalence of significant verbal memory improvements was 12% (3/26)., INTERPRETATION: RS for unilateral mesial temporal lobe epilepsy offers seizure remission rates comparable with those reported previously for open surgery. There were no major safety concerns with high-dose RS compared with low-dose RS.

Material(s) and Method(s): A total of 23 patients with retroperitoneal lymph node metastases and those who had moderate-to-severe pain from January 2014 to December 2018 were enrolled in the study. The primary tumors included pancreatic (n = 12), gastric (n = 4), hepatocellular (n = 4), colorectal (n = 2), and esophageal carcinomas (n= 1). Patients were treated with CT-guided percutaneous125 I brachytherapy during the study. The Brief Pain Inventory-Short Form was used to record and compare pain intensity and interference by pain. Treatment-related complications were also evaluated according to the Radiation Therapy Oncology Group/European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Late Radiation Morbidity Scoring Criteria. Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS software version 22.0 Results: The primary success rate of125 I seed implantation was 95.7% (22 of the 23 patients). As pain evolved, the patients achieved obvious pain palliation ratings for 'worst pain' and 'average pain' at 72 h and 4 weeks after brachytherapy, respectively, whereas 'pain right now' at 12 weeks was significantly relieved after brachytherapy. No serious complications developed during the perioperative period.

589,"Nail dystrophy and periungual discoloration in sarcoidosis. Background : Sarcoidosis is a multisystem granulomatous disorder that can affect all organs of the body. The disease course can vary from a self-limiting illness to a chronic disease with flares and relapses. Nail changes are rare in sarcoidosis, but can include clubbing, discolouration, dystrophy, subungual hyperkeratosis, splinter haemorrhages and longitudinal ridges. Such changes are frequently an indication of systemic disease, We report a rare case of systemic sarcoidosis presenting as nail dystrophy with painful phalanges and underlying bony cysts. Observation: A 57 year old moroccan woman, with a 2-year history of periungual redpurplish discoloration associated with nail dystrophy of 4 of his toes, presented to the dermatology department. Examination of his toes showed evidence of red to purple discoloration in the nail folds with associated nail dystrophy and subungual hyperkeratosis. Examination of his entire skin showed a symetric ulcerated dactilitis of 2 fingers. Nail clippings were obtained for mycological examination, with negative results. A Hand and toes X-ray demonstrated bony cysts, trabecular pattern and osteolysis in distal phalanx. CT showed multiples lymphadenopaty above and under diaphragmatic. A punch biopsy taken from the nail bed, the lymphadenopathy and salivary gland showed sarcoid granulomas in the dermis and a chronic inflammatory infiltrate. With all this finding, the diagnosis of systemic sarcoidosis was making, and the patient receive a systemic treatment with corticosteroid: 0.5 mg/kg/day. After 1 week of treatment, the patient had a good response. Key message: Although nail changes are rare in sarcoidosis, they are often associated with systemic involvement (commonly pulmonary involvement, dactylitis and lymphadenopathy) and underlying bony changes. Thus, in patients presenting with nail involvement, a search for possible systemic involvement should take place, and this should include radiological imaging of hands and feet alongside chest imaging.",Excluded

1639,"Detection of point mutations at codon 12 of KI-ras in ophthalmic pterygia. AIMS: Ophthalmic pterygium is a potentially vision-threatening lesion of unknown etiology, related to an exposure to solar light. Mutations to the ras genes are frequently observed in lesions related to an exposure to solar light. The present study aims at screening pterygia for mutations at codons 12 and 13 of the ras genes., METHODS: In all, 50 pterygia were examined, together with respective blood samples and specimens of normal conjunctiva. A PCR reaction was performed to amplify sequences containing codons 12 and 13 of Ki-ras, H-ras, and N-ras. An RFLP analysis was then performed to detect point mutations at codon 12. The mutational status at codons 12 and 13 was further explored with sequencing of PCR products., RESULTS: RFLP analysis revealed Ki-ras mutations at codon 12 in five (10%) of pterygia, whereas H-ras or N-ras mutations were not observed. Sequencing confirmed Ki-ras mutations at codon 12 and revealed absence of mutations at codon 13. The presence of Ki-ras mutations was significantly correlated with postoperative recurrence (P=0.02) and young age (P=0.04). Mutations were not observed in specimens of blood or normal conjunctiva for any of the genes examined., CONCLUSIONS: The absence of N-ras mutations is in agreement with previous reports concerning mucosal lesions. The detection of Ki-ras mutations and the association with postoperative recurrence implies a possible role of Ki-ras in the clinical profile of pterygium. The mechanism of Ki-ras mutations is unclear and could be independent of the action of UV light.",Excluded
3402,"Osteosarcoma of the flat bone. Objective: We aimed to understand the biology of osteosarcoma of the flat bone, which is a rare tumor entity. Method(s): Cases with osteosarcoma of the flat bone were compared with those of the extremity in order to evaluate their clinicopathologic characteristics. And the influences of heterogeneous treatment modalities on outcome were analyzed. Result(s): Tumors of the flat bone comprised 91 (11.3%) of 806 osteosarcoma cases. Eight cases were secondary osteosarcoma associated with previous radiotherapy. Patients with a flat bone tumor were significantly older and more likely to present with metastases at diagnosis than extremity tumor. The proportions of female sex and chondroblastic subtype were higher among flat bone tumors than among extremity tumors. The 5-year overall survival and event-free survival rates were 35.2 +/- 5.4% and 24.7 +/- 5.5%, respectively. Although age and histologic response to pre-operative chemotherapy were not related to outcome of flat bone tumors, treatment modality influenced the survival. Patients treated surgically had better outcomes than those treated by another means. Radiation therapy did not appear to be an effective local control measure as surgery. Conclusion(s): Treatment outcome of the tumor of the flat bone was worse than extremity tumors. Further studies are needed to identify effective local control measures that can substitute for surgery and to determine the biologic characteristics of osteosarcoma of the flat bone. © The Author (2009).

These results demonstrate for the first time that a vertebrate can ovulate in the virtual absence of gravity, and that the eggs can develop to a free-living stage.",Excluded
265,"A comparison of in vivo cellular responses to CS-137 gamma rays and 320-KV X rays. Research reported here relates to comparing the relative effectiveness of 320-kV X rays compared to Cs-137 gamma rays for two in vivo endpoints in C.B-17 mice after whole-body exposure: (1) cytotoxicity to bone marrow cells and splenocytes evaluated at 24-hours post exposure and (2) bone marrow and spleen reconstitution deficits (repopulation shortfalls) evaluated at 6 weeks post exposure. We show that cytotoxicity dose-response relationships for bone marrow cells and splenocytes are complex, involving negative curvature (decreasing slope as dose increases), presumably implicating a mixed cell population comprised of large numbers of hypersensitive, modestly radiosensitive, and resistant cells. The radiosensitive cells appear to respond with 50% being killed by a dose < 0.5 Gy. The X-ray relative biological effectiveness (RBE), relative to gamma rays, for destroying bone marrow cells in vivo is > 1, while for destroying splenocytes it is < 1. In contrast, dose-response relationships for reconstitution deficits in the bone marrow and spleen of C.B-17 mice at 6 weeks after radiation exposure were of the threshold type with gamma rays being more effective in causing reconstitution deficit. © 2013 University of Massachusetts.",Excluded
3047,"Real-time optical image guided radiation therapy (IGRT) of breast/chest wall cancer. Purpose/Objective(s):We are developing real-time 3D/4D video guidance to reduce breast and chest wall setup errors and track target motion during post-mastectomy chest wall/nodal irradiation, breast only irradiation, and breast nodal irradiation in a clinical trial. We have also compared the reliability, accuracy, and precision of camera-based IGRT with results of weekly portal image verification and weekly CBCT volumetric matching. Materials/Methods: One-hundred forty patients, 102 breast only, 23 breast + nodal, and 15 chest wall + nodal, were accrued in an IRB-approved clinical trial of IGRT using 3D/4D optical images at daily setup and beamon time. Breast board and vacuum bag were used for all patients. Eleven patients with left-side diseases were treated under deep inspiration breath hold using ABC device and twenty-two patient using IMRT. Target shifts and rotations relating to CT-based planned reference surface were determined with real-time optical surface images using modified iterativeclosest-point alignment. A selected light ray intersecting the middle-upper abdominal surface and the anterior surface of the target projected onto the principal components were used as the real-time point/marker-based and surface/volume-based motion tracking, respectively. The optical guidance and real-time respiratory motion tracking were completely performed by therapists and results were semi-automatically saved in the camera-control computer. The target displacements (shifts and rotations) were compared with results of the weekly CBCT and portal images from EPID. Motion curves of surface Intersection point and surface principal components were also compared with breathing volume curves from the ABC system. Result(s): Daily target setup errors were reduced from 0.9 cm to <0.4 cm by using the 3D/4D video surface-guidance that was always consistent with results of portal images and CBCT if there were no big body motion during CBCT scanning. Higher accuracy and precision of 0.2 cm and longer stability without hardware change for clinical usage in four years were achieved for the video camera operated at the imaging speed and tracking rate of 15 frames per second. The novel intersection point and surface motion trackings were also more sensitive and accurate than that of commercial RPM and ABC systems. UP to 2 cm body sag on the slant breast board during longer IMRT treatments and surface deformation for five large breasts and some patients undertaken deep breath hold irradiation were detected. Conclusion(s): Accurate and precise optical image-guided setup of breast and chest wall targets was clinically validated with thousands of portal images and CBCT scans on 140 patients. More importantly, one can reliably track irregular target motion during daily dose delivery and detect gross target deformation during the entire course of treatment. The video guidance provides us all-time IGRT of breast and chest wall cancer without large volume low dose irradiation in taking daily CBCT and/or portal images.",Excluded

Background: Cervical metastases from unknown primary tumors are rare and no clear therapeutic options are available. This retrospective analysis aimed to evaluate toxicity and activity of a sequential chemoradiation regimen consisting of induction chemotherapy followed by extendedfield radiotherapy in patients with cervical metastases from unknown primary tumors. Patients and Methods: Patients with cytological or histological diagnosis of latero-cervical lymph-node metastasis from carcinoma with unknown origin treated with sequential chemotherapy (3 cycles of docetaxel and cisplatin, each administered as intravenous infusion at the dose of 75 mg/m2 on day 1, every 21 days) and radiotherapy (cumulative dose of 70 Gy) were included in this study. The radiological response was assessed by central review according to the revised RECIST criteria. Result(s): Fifteen patients received three cycles of induction chemotherapy with the combination of docetaxel and cisplatin. Patients were subsequently treated with extendedfield radiotherapy. Three complete responses were observed after induction chemotherapy and 13 after the chemoradiation treatment. The overall response rate after chemoradiation, was 93.3% (14 of 15 evaluable patients). One year disease-free-survival was 83.3% (10 of 12 evaluable patients). Treatment was well-tolerated; two cases of grade 4 neutropenia, two of grade 3 mucositis and eight of grade 2 nausea were the worst, most clinically-relevant sideeffects.

2499,"Long-Term outcome of the treatment of high-risk tenosynovial giant cell tumor/pigmented villonodular synovitis with radiotherapy and surgery. BACKGROUND: The treatment of diffuse tenosynovial giant cell tumor (TGCT) requires extensive surgical resection of the hypertrophic synovium and multiple soft tissue masses yet still may result in high rates of local failure. The authors of this report examined their experience in treating patients with advanced/multiply recurrent TGCT with a combination of surgery and external-beam radiotherapy. METHOD(S): Fifty patients who were treated for TGCT with radiotherapy and surgery from 1972 to 2006 were identified. Patient demographics, radiotherapy treatment parameters, surgical treatment, and oncologic and functional outcomes were evaluated. All patients had pathologic review at presentation and required at least 1 year follow-up. RESULT(S): Forty-nine patients had diffuse TGCT with both intra-articular and extra-articular disease (1 had malignant TGCT). Twenty-eight patients (56%) were referred after at least 1 local recurrence. Thirty patients (60%) underwent at least 2 operations before radiotherapy. The mean dose of radiation delivered was 39.8 gray. At a mean follow-up of 94 months (range, 19-330 months), 47 patients (94%) had not developed a recurrence or had stable disease/signal characteristics on serial cross-sectional imaging (for those patients who had gross residual disease at the time of radiotherapy). Two patients required subsequent total hip arthroplasty because of progressive osteoarthritis, and there were 4 cases of avascular necrosis (only 1 post-Treatment). Forty-one patients had good/excellent function. CONCLUSION(S): For patients with extensive or multiple local relapses or when surgery alone would result in a large burden of residual disease or major functional loss, the addition of moderate-dose adjuvant radiotherapy provided excellent local control while maintaining good function with low treatment-related morbidity. © 2012 American Cancer Society.",Excluded
2357,"Probability of receiving a high cumulative radiation dose and primary clinical indication of CT examinations: A 5-year observational cohort study. Objective High radiation exposure is a concern because of the association with cancer. The objective was to determine the probability of receiving a high radiation dose from CT (from one or more examinations within a 5-year period) and to assess the clinical context by evaluating clinical indications in the high-dose patient group. Design Observational cohort study. Effective radiation dose received from one or more CT examinations within a predefined 5-year calendar period was assessed for each patient. Setting Hospital setting. Participants All patients undergoing a diagnostic CT examination between July 2013 and July 2018 at the Maastricht University Medical Center. Primary and secondary outcome measures The primary outcome was the probability of receiving a high effective dose, defined as >=100 mSv, from one or more CT examinations within 5 years as derived from a time-to-event analysis. Secondary outcomes were the clinical indication for the initial scan of patients receiving a high effective dose. Results 100 672 CT examinations were performed among 49 978 patients including 482 (1%) who received a high radiation dose. The estimated probability of a high effective dose from a single examination is low (0.002% (95% CI 0.00% to 0.01%)). The 4.5-year probability of receiving a high cumulative effective dose was 1.9% (95% CI 1.6% to 2.2%) for women and 1.5% (95% CI 1.3% to 1.7%) for men. The probability was highest in age categories between 51 and 74 years. A total of 2711 (5.5%) of patients underwent more than six CT examinations, and the probability of receiving a high effective dose was 16%. Among patients who received a high effective dose, most indications (80%) were oncology related. Conclusions The probability of receiving a high radiation dose from CT examinations is small but not negligible. In the majority (80%) of high effective dose receiving patients, the indication for the initial CT scan was oncology related.Copyright © Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2021.

192,"Extensive experience in the management of macroprolactinomas. Objectives Macroprolactinomas are pituitary tumours that can be managed with dopamine agonists (DA), surgery and radiotherapy. We aimed to assess the outcomes of these treatment modalities. Design Retrospective case-note study of patients managed in a single tertiary referral centre. Patients One hundred patients (68 male) diagnosed with macroprolactinoma between 1971 and 2009. Measurements We assessed the response to first-line treatment in terms of reduction in serum prolactin, endocrine status, symptomatic improvement and tumour shrinkage. Patients were divided into a group that received only DA therapy and a group that received surgery, radiotherapy or both, with or without a DA. We compared pituitary function at baseline and at last clinic visit between the two groups. Results In total, there were 1170 patient years of follow-up. Pituitary surgery was performed in 29/100 patients. Fourteen patients received pituitary radiotherapy (8/14 surgery also). At last clinic visit, the nonmedical therapy group had a higher risk of gonadotrophin deficiency (77.4% vs 44.8%, P = 0.0037), TSH deficiency (54.8% vs 25.4%, P = 0.0009) and ACTH deficiency (56.2% vs 17.2%, P = 0.0001). When last reviewed, 23/29 (79.3%) patients who underwent surgery and 10/14 (71.4%) patients who received radiotherapy were taking a DA. Conclusions Treatment with a DA alone is associated with better outcomes in terms of pituitary function and as such represents the optimal first-line therapy for macroprolactinomas. Surgery and radiotherapy should be reserved for patients who are either intolerant of or resistant to DAs. Following surgery and/or radiotherapy, the majority of patients still require a DA for control of prolactin hypersecretion. © 2014 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",Excluded

2184,"Treatment selection and outcomes in early-stage classical Hodgkin lymphoma: Analysis of the National Cancer Data Base. Purpose: The choice between combined-modality therapy (CMT) and chemotherapy alone for early-stage Hodgkin lymphoma (HL) remains controversial. Our objective was to define factors affecting treatment selection and resulting survival outcomes in the United States. Patients and Methods: We identified 20,600 patients treated with CMT or chemotherapy between 2003 and 2011 from the National Cancer Data Base. Factors affecting treatment selection were studied in a mixed-effects logistic model. Survival outcomes were compared using a propensity score analysis to account for indication bias. Result(s): Only 49.5% of patients received CMT, and this proportion steadily declined between 2003 (59.4%) and 2011 (45.2%), particularly in younger patients. Apart from classical prognostic factors (age, stage, tumor location, histology, comorbidities), treatment selection was significantly influenced by sex, black race, distance to facility, and type of insurance. Uninsured patients had the lowest odds of receiving CMT. A significant random effect related to facility-specific treatment preference was also evident. Estimated 5-year overall survival (OS) was 89.6%, and relative survival (RS) was 94.3%. After adjustment for guarantee-time and indication biases, CMT was associated with better OS (hazard ratio [HR], 0.61; 95% CI, 0.53 to 0.70) and RS (excess HR, 0.42; 95% CI, 0.33 to 0.54) than chemotherapy alone. This effect was without significant heterogeneity in subset analysis and was not sensitive to unobserved confounding. Conclusion(s): Socioeconomic factors affect selection of curative treatments in HL. Widespread abandonment of CMT beyond circumstances sanctioned by guidelines may affect survival. Further research should focus on developing strategies that minimize toxicity and access disparities without compromising survival.Copyright © 2015 by American Society of Clinical Oncology.",Excluded

3561,"Predictive factors in esophageal cancer after neoadjuvant therapy. BACKGROUND: Preoperative chemoradiation therapy (PCX) was introduced to improve the outcome of patients with oesophageal cancer (EC), but conflicting results have been released. Some 20-30% of patients show a complete pathological response, however, the perioperative morbidity and mortality is increased. To search for factors indicating response prior to the onset of PCX we investigated the proliferative activity (MIB-1), the expression of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), and the capillary density (CD34) tissue specimens of ECs were available by endoscopy prior to the start of the treatment. METHOD(S): Forty-six (MIB-1) and 21 (VEGF, CD34) tissue specimens of ECs were available from 56 patients undergoing pretherapeutic endoscopy, PCX and surgery. Perioperative morbidity was divided into surgery and non-surgery related morbidity. MIB-1, VEGF and CD34 expression were investigated immunohistochemically. Multivariate analysis was carried out to prove independence of investigated variables. RESULT(S): Postoperative morbidity was noticed in 54 of 56 operated patents. Eight of 56 patients who received PCX died in hospital. Survival was significantly different between the group of complete responders (n=14) and non-responders (n=23; P = 0.0026). None of investigated tumour samples from patients with a complete response (CR) had a proliferation index of less than 45. Tumour samples from patients with a CR showed a VEGF expression of 10.7 compared with 36.58 of tumours with no response (P = 0.035). CD34 expression showed a correlation with VEGF expression. The relation of mean indices of VEGF expression and proliferative activity in tumours from patients with complete, partial or no response was 10. 7:58.8, 18.3:53.8 and 36.6:43.5, respectively. CONCLUSION(S): According to these results, it may be expected that tumours with a VEGF/MIB-1 ratio of 1:5 or less prior to PCX will respond to this therapy.",Excluded

The relative effectiveness of different combinations of estrogen therapy and radiation therapy against the R-3327 prostatic adenocarcinoma of the Copenhagen rat was studied. Because of similar actions of estrogens and radiation in the cell cycle, and possibly antagonistic effects reported in the clinical literature, we looked for an antagonism between these two therapeutic modalities. Radiation therapy consistently showed a greater tumor inhibitory effect than estrogen therapy alone at the dose tested. Combinations of radiation therapy with hormonal manipulation did not appear to show a greater inhibition of tumor growth than radiation therapy alone.

40,"Clinical PET of neuroendocrine tumors using 64Cu-DOTATATE: first-in-humans study. UNLABELLED: The use of positron emitter-labeled compounds for somatostatin receptor imaging (SRI) has become attractive because of the prospect of improved spatial resolution, accelerated imaging procedures, and the ability to quantify tissue radioactivity concentrations. This paper provides results from first-in-humans use of (64)Cu-DOTATATE, an avidly binding somatostatin receptor ligand linked to a radioisotope with intermediate half-life and favorable positron energy (half-life, 12.7 h; maximum positron energy, 0.653 MeV)., METHODS: In a prospective setup, 14 patients with a history of neuroendocrine tumors underwent both PET/CT with (64)Cu-DOTATATE and SPECT/CT with our current routine imaging agent (111)In-diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid-octreotide. After intravenous injection of 193-232 MBq of (64)Cu-DOTATATE, whole-body PET scans were acquired at 1 h (n = 14), 3 h (n = 12), and 24 h (n = 5) after administration. Tissue radioactivity concentrations for normal organs and lesions were quantified, and standardized uptake values were calculated for the early (1 h) and delayed (3 h) scans. Using the data for 5 patients, we assessed the radiation dose with OLINDA/EXM software. Furthermore, the clinical performance of (64)Cu-DOTATATE with respect to lesion detection was compared with conventional SRI., RESULTS: SRI with (64)Cu-DOTATATE produced images of excellent quality and high spatial resolution. Images were characterized by high and stable tumor-to-background ratios over an imaging time window of at least 3 h. Compared with conventional scintigraphy, (64)Cu-DOTATATE PET identified additional lesions in 6 of 14 patients (43%). In 5 patients, lesions were localized in organs and organ systems not previously known as metastatic sites, including the early-stage detection of a secondary neuroendocrine tumor in a patient with a known mutation in the multiple endocrine neoplasia type I gene. All major additional findings seen only on PET could be confirmed on the basis of a clinical follow-up interval of 18 mo. Calculated radiation dose estimates yielded an effective dose of 6.3 mSv for an injected activity of 200 MBq of (64)Cu-DOTATATE, with the liver being the organ with the highest absorbed radiation dose (0.16 mGy/MBq)., CONCLUSION: This first-in-humans study supports the clinical use of (64)Cu-DOTATATE for SRI with excellent imaging quality, reduced radiation burden, and increased lesion detection rate when compared with (111)In-diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid-octreotide.",Excluded

Background: Multidetector-row computed tomography is often used as a first-line test in the diagnostic evaluation of cardiovascular diseases including aortic dissection, coronary artery disease and pulmonary embolism. This study evaluated the impact of reducing the tube potential from 120 kVp to 100 kVp in a selected group of patients presenting to the Emergency Room with acute chest pain. The primary end point was how the reduction of radiation dose affected image quality. Method(s): The current study was performed over a period of 2 years between July, 2016 and July, 2018. This study included patients who presented to the Emergency Room or to an outpatient clinic and were suspected to have a coronary, a pulmonary (pulmonary embolism), or an aortic (aortic dissection) etiology. Suspicion was determined by the medical provider based on clinical picture, EKG, and lab results when available. All patients were referred for computed tomography angiography (CTA) testing as part of their diagnostic evaluation. A total of 84 patients were involved in the study. Seventy of the patients underwent the low acquisition Kvp technique (100 Kvp - Group I). In the remaining 14 patients, the standard acquisition technique (120-140 Kvp - Group II) was utilized. Result(s): This study showed the feasibility of using low energy CTA to significantly reduce the patient's radiation exposure without markedly affecting the image quality and diagnostic accuracy. Conclusion(s): The use of low energy CTA protocols in cases of acute chest pain revealed no major difference regarding the image quality with marked reduction of the radiation dose received by the patient.Copyright © 2020 Elsevier Inc.",Excluded
2095,"Reducing the Radiation Dose for CT Colonography: Effect of Low Tube Voltage and Iterative Reconstruction. Rationale and Objectives: The purpose of this study was to assess the effect of a low-tube-voltage technique and iterative reconstruction (IR) on the radiation dose and image quality of computed tomography colonography (CTC). Material(s) and Method(s): We studied 30 patients (14 women and 16 men; mean age, 64.5 +/- 13.1 years; range, 39-90 years) with colorectal cancer referred for surgical treatment. All underwent CTC with fecal tagging under a standard 120-kVp protocol in the supine position and a 100-kVp protocol in the prone position. The 120-kVp images were reconstructed with filtered back projection (FBP). The 100-kVp images were postprocessed using FBP and a hybrid type of IR (adaptive iterative dose reduction 3D). The effective radiation dose (ED), image noise, and contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR) were compared among the three protocols. The visual image quality was scored on a four-point scale. Result(s): The mean ED was significantly lower under the 100-kVp protocol than the 120-kVp protocol, resulting in a 27% radiation dose decrease (3.5 +/- 2.0 vs 2.5 +/- 1.5 mSv; P <01). Image noise decreased by 48%, and the mean attenuation of tagged fluid increased from 452 to 558 HU on images acquired at 100 kVp with IR compared to that in the 120-kVp protocol; these differences were significant. The mean CNR was significantly higher under the 100 kVp with IR than the other two protocols. We found no significant differences in the visual scores for diagnostic utility between the 100 kVp with IR and the 120 kVp with FBP protocol (P=10). Conclusion(s): Low-tube-voltage CTC reduced the radiation dose by approximately 27% while maintaining the image quality.Copyright © 2016 AUR.",Excluded

BACKGROUND: The current study was conducted to characterize the risks and clinical consequences of oral mucositis (OM) in patients with head and neck carcinoma (HNC) who are receiving radiation therapy., METHODS: Data regarding 450 HNC patients who had received radiation therapy were collected via chart review from 154 U.S. medical and radiation oncologists. Information obtained included patient characteristics, treatments received, highest recorded grade of OM during radiation therapy (none, mild, moderate, or severe), and outcomes potentially associated with mucosal injury., RESULTS: The mean age (+/- standard deviation [SD]) of the study subjects was 61.3 years (12.3 yrs); the majority of patients (80%) were men. Primary tumor locations included the oropharynx (26.4%), larynx (26.4%), oral cavity including the lip (24.4%), hypopharynx (13.6%), and nasopharynx (9.1%). The majority of tumors were new and were classified as AJCC Stages III or IV. The majority of patients (83%) received standard radiation therapy; the mean (+/- SD) cumulative dose was 6285 centigrays (cGy) (+/- 1158 cGy). Approximately 33% of the patients received concomitant chemotherapy. The majority of patients (83%) developed OM; 29% developed severe OM. Patients with severe OM were more likely to have nasopharyngeal or oropharyngeal tumors (adjusted odds ratio [OR] of 10.1 [95% confidence interval (95% CI), 2.1-49.9] and 6.9 [95% CI, 2.4-19.7], respectively), and to have received cumulative radiation doses > 5000 cGy (OR of 10.4; 95% CI, 2.9-37.1) and concomitant chemotherapy (OR of 3.3; 95% CI, 1.4-8.0).

15,"Conditional survival among patients with oropharyngeal cancer treated with radiation therapy and alive without recurrence 5 years after diagnosis. Background: Risk of recurrence among patients with oropharyngeal cancer (OPC) who survive 5 years is low. The goal of this study was to assess long-term survival of patients with OPC alive without recurrence 5 years after diagnosis. Method(s): This study included newly diagnosed patients with OPC, who had been treated with radiation and were alive without recurrence 5 years after diagnosis. Overall survival (OS) probabilities beyond 5 years were estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method. Factors associated with OS were determined using Bayesian piecewise exponential survival regression. Standardized mortality ratios for all-cause death were estimated controlling for study year, age, and sex in the US general population. Result(s): Among 1699 patients, the additional 2-year, 5-year, and 10-year OS probabilities were 94%, 83%, and 63%, respectively, and were lower than those in the general population. Patients who were older, were current or former smokers, had other than tonsil or base of tongue tumors, or had T4 tumors had a higher risk of death. Patients who had base of tongue tumors and had received intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) or lower-radiation doses had a lower risk of death. Standardized mortality ratios were higher among current and heavy smokers and lower among recipients of IMRT and lower radiation doses. Conclusion(s): In this large cohort, long-term survival among patients with OPC was good but lower than predicted for the general population.

2627,"Pushing the limits: establishing an ultra-low framerate and antiscatter grid-less radiation protocol for left atrial ablations. Aims: Despite the use of 3D mapping systems and new developments of non-fluoroscopic options, most centres still rely at least in part on fluoroscopy for catheter visualization during catheter ablations. The purpose of this study was to assess the feasibility of using an ultra-low frame rate and antiscatter grid-less radiation protocol during complex left atrial ablations to minimize radiation exposure for the patient and staff., Methods and results: A total of 150 consecutive patients undergoing left atrial ablations in our hospital were included in the analysis. The procedures were performed between January 2015 and November 2016. Of the included patients 75 (50%) underwent ablation before and 75 (50%) after the ultra-low frame rate (reduced from 4 to 2 FPS) and antiscatter grid-less radiation protocol was established. Procedures performed after the dose reduction protocol was established showed a 64% reduction of the dose area product (630.28 +/- 550.96 vs. 226.44 +/- 277.44 microGym2, P < 0.001), while fluoroscopy duration (14.22 +/- 4.47 vs. 13.62 +/- 7.11 min, P = 0.066) and procedural duration (1:48 +/- 0:28 vs. 1:53 +/- 0:34 min, P = 0.525) were not prolonged. Acute procedural success was achieved in all procedures. Two complications occurred before and one complication after the protocol was established. During four procedures, operators decided to re-introduce the antiscatter grid. This was due to impaired visibility in morbidly obese patients (n = 2) or technically difficult transseptal puncture (n = 2)., Conclusion: The use of an ultra low framerate and antiscatter grid-less radiation protocol effectively reduced radiation dose for complex left atrial ablation procedures and lead to very low average patient doses. Reduced image quality did not impair procedural and fluoroscopy duration or acute procedural success.",Excluded

In an image-intensifier angiographic system, the tube potential is commonly regulated in ranges from 75 to 90 kV for digital subtraction angiography (DSA) and fluoroscopy in transarterial chemoembolization therapy (TACE) for hepatocellular carcinoma. The purpose of this study was to investigate whether or not a 120-kV tube potential could be used for DSA and fluoroscopy in TACE to decrease the skin dose. Forty-three patients administered TACE were randomly allocated into two groups: TACE was performed using standard-kilovoltage (75- to 90-kV) DSA and fluoroscopy modes (group A; n = 20) or using high-kilovoltage (120-kV) modes (group B; n = 23). The peak skin dose was compared between the groups. One case in group A was excluded from the study because the HCC nodule was not depicted on DSA. The peak skin dose (mGy) for group A was 383.6 +/- 176.5 and that for group B was 265.1 +/- 145.1. The peak skin dose was decreased by 31% in the 120-kV mode, a statistically significant difference (t-test, p = 0.022). We conclude that the use of 120 kV tube potential for DSA and fluoroscopy may be one option for performing TACE while decreasing the skin dose. © 2007 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.",Excluded

The aim of our study to present the method of TBI developed in our department, and to discuss the results of treatment with respect of early and late toxicity. Material and methods. Between 11.2000 and 08.2004 23 patients were treated with fractionated TBI at the Department od Radiotherapy of the M. Sklodowska-Curie Memorial Cancer Center and Institute of Oncology in Warsawa (MSCMCC). Conditioning chemotherapy and BMT were performed in different hematological departments. All patients were irradiated with a total midline dose of 12 Gy in 6 fractions over 3 consecutive days. Doses to the lung did not exceed 11 Gy. The TBI method used in our department was evaluated over a few years. The following modifications have been introduced to the previously applied technique: change of photon energy from 6 MV to 15 MV; increase of lung dose from 9 Gy to 11 Gy; the use of an individual bolus as a lung compensator in lateral fields; more frequent boost irradiation of the mediastinum and legs with small fields; calculations of Monitor Units based on dosimetric data. Boost irradiation of the chest wall with electrons has been abandoned. Results. Median follow up was 12 months. Up till now, 17/23 patients are alive, of these 16 with no relapse. Immediate toxicity was low. Early complications were observed during the first 6 months after BMT in 11 patients. In the case of 4 patients these complications were fatal. Late complications were observed in 10 patients, including chronic GVHD and hormone disturbancy. Only one patient had developed the first symptoms of cataract. In one case Lhermitte's syndrome was observed. One patient died due to liver insufficiency. Conclusions. The results of treatment and the complications rates in patients treated with TBI at our department are consistent with those published in literature. We conclud that our method of TBI is safe and well tolerated.",Excluded
490,"Model-based iterative reconstruction and adaptive statistical iterative reconstruction techniques in abdominal CT: comparison of image quality in the detection of colorectal liver metastases. PURPOSE: To prospectively evaluate dose reduction and image quality characteristics of abdominal computed tomographic (CT) scans reconstructed with model-based iterative reconstruction (MBIR) compared with adaptive statistical iterative reconstruction (ASIR) in oncology patients with colorectal liver metastases., MATERIALS AND METHODS: The study complied with HIPAA guidelines and was approved by the ethics committee of the institutional review board. All patients gave written informed consent. Fifty-one patients with colorectal liver metastases underwent body CT (thorax and abdomen) with a 64-section multidetector unit. With a radiation dose reduction by 2.36 mGy compared to standard of care CT with ASIR 50% (radiation dose, 7.54 mGy), MBIR can provide diagnostically acceptable CT scans without compromising image quality. Two radiologists independently assessed randomized images in a blinded manner. Imaging sets were compared for lesion detection, lesion conspicuity, overall image quality, and signal-to-noise ratio with a paired sample t test. Inter- and intraobserver agreement was assessed with the Cohen kappa., RESULTS: The mean volume CT dose index was 5.18 mGy +/- 0.76, mean dose-length product 374 mGy . cm +/- 63.47, mean effective diameter 29.38 cm +/- 3.46, and mean size-specific dose estimate 6.52 mGy +/- 0.73. In small liver lesions (<10 mm), detection and conspicuity were significantly higher with MBIR than with ASIR for both right (t = 3.245, P = .004 and t = 2.696, P = .013, respectively) and left (t = 2.390, P = .038 and t = 2.283, P = .046) liver lobes. Subjective image noise (t = 4.506, P < .001), artifacts (t = 3.479, P = .001), and diagnostic confidence (t = 2.643, P = .011) were significantly better with MBIR than with ASIR., CONCLUSION: MBIR performed better than ASIR 50% at providing diagnostically acceptable CT scans without compromising image quality and in the detection of colorectal liver metastases.

183,"Combined use of TUR and laser ablation in the treatment of bladder cancer. Introduction: Superficial bladder cancer (SBC) tends to recur (30 80%) after transurethral resection (TUR) of the bladder wall. The aim of the study was a comparative analysis of efficacy of standard TUR and combined use of TUR and laser ablation in the treatment of patients with SBC. Material(s) and Method(s): 60 patients (male 41, female 19) with SBC were treated in the urological clinic of Saratov State Medical University. The age of the patients varied between 43 and 80 years (mean 60.7+/-0.5). The primary bladder tumor was registered in 47 patients, 13 patients were hospitalized due to relapse of a disease. In clinical and morphological investigations transitional cell carcinoma in the stage Ta T1N0M0G1 2 was diagnosed. All patients were divided into two groups. In 23 patients of the first group, standard TUR was applied with use of KARL STORZ Endoscope. In the second group, TUR was combined with consecutive noncontact irradiation of the tumor bed and adjacent area (1 cm2) by the light of Nd:YAG laser (""Sharplan"", lambda 1,064 nm, power 65W, total energy 20-40 kJ). Result(s): In the first group, 6 patients had relapse of the bladder cancer during the first year, and total number of patients with relapse was 7 (30.4% cases). Accordingly three years recurrence free survival rate was 69.6% in the first group. In the second group, relapse rate was only 10.8% and three years recurrence free period was 89.2%. Difference between the groups was statistically significant (p < 0.05). Conclusion(s): Combined use of TUR and laser ablation improves the results of the surgical treatment of the patients with SBC.",Excluded
230,"Indirect computed tomography venography with a low-tube-voltage technique: Reduction in the radiation and contrast material dose-A prospective randomized study. Objective: The objective of the study was to investigate the effects of low-tube-voltage computed tomography (CT) venography on qualitative and quantitative image parameters and the radiation dose. Method(s): Eighty-eight studies on 84 patients underwent pelvic and lower-extremity CT venography under protocol A (standard 120 kV with 150 mL of contrast material, n = 44) or protocol B (80 kV with 100 mL of contrast material, n = 44) on a 64-detector CT scanner. We compared the dose length product in the 2 protocols. Two blinded observers measured CT attenuation in the veins, the image noise, contrast-to-noise ratio, and figure of merit. Result(s): The mean dose length product was significantly lower under protocol B than A (603.2 [SD, 67.2] vs 1131.7 [SD, 67.0] mGy x cm) (P < 0.01). Mean CT attenuation of the veins was significantly greater with protocol B (125.3 [SD, 16.2] vs 106.1 [SD, 16.0] Hounsfield units) (P < 0.01), and the mean image noise was also significantly higher under protocol B (6.6 [SD, 0.8] vs 4.9 [SD, 0.7] Hounsfield units) (P < 0.01). There was no difference in contrast-to-noise ratio (P = 0.46). Figure of merit was significantly higher under protocol B (P < 0.01). Conclusion(s): Computed tomography venography with a low-tube-voltage technique allows reducing the radiation dose and the amount of contrast material without image quality degradation.

129,"Induction treatment in patients with stage III non-small cell lung cancer. Stage III non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) comprises a highly heterogeneous group of patients defined according to the extent and localization of disease. Patients with discrete N2 involvement identified preoperatively with resectable disease are candidates for multimodal therapy either with definitive chemoradiation therapy, induction chemotherapy, or chemoradiotherapy (CTRT) followed by surgery. Neoadjuvant chemotherapy has yielded comparable survival benefit to adjuvant chemotherapy in patients with stage II-III disease and may allow for downstaging the tumor or the lymph nodes, an earlier delivery of systemic treatment, and better compliance to systemic therapy. The use of immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) as induction therapy shows encouraging activity and a favorable safety profile in patients with resectable early stage or locally advanced NSCLC. An unprecedented rate of pathological response and downstaging has been reported in single-arm clinical trials, especially when immunotherapy is combined with neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Ongoing randomized phase II/III clinical trials assessing the efficacy and safety of induction with immunotherapy plus chemotherapy have the potential to establish this therapeutic approach as a novel standard of care. These trials aim to validate pathological response as a surrogate marker of survival benefit and to demonstrate that this therapeutic strategy can improve the cure rate in patients with stage II-III NSCLC.Copyright © Translational Lung Cancer Research.

1356,"Low Intensity laser therapy in patients with burning mouth syndrome: a randomized, placebo-controlled study. The aim of this study was to assess the effectiveness of low intensity laser therapy in patients with Burning Mouth Syndrome (BMS). Thirty BMS subjects were randomized into two groups - Laser (LG) and Placebo (CG). Seven patients dropped out, leaving 13 patients in LG and 10 patients in CG. Each patient received 4 irradiations (laser or placebo) twice a week, for two consecutive weeks (blinded to the type of irradiation received). Infrared laser (AsGaAI) irradiations were applied to the affected mucosa in scanning mode, wavelength of 790 nm, output power of 20 mW and fluence of 6 J/cm2. A visual analogue scale (VAS) was used to assess the therapeutic effect before and after each irradiation, and at all the control time periods: 7, 14, 30, 60 and 90 days after the last irradiation. One researcher delivered irradiation and another recorded the results. Both researchers were blinded, the first to the results, and the second to the type of radiation applied. The results were categorized according to the percentage of symptom level variation, and showed a statistically better response in LG in only two categories of the control checkpoints (p=0.02; Fisher's Exact Test). According to the protocol used in this study, low intensity laser therapy is as beneficial to patients with BMS as placebo treatment, indicating a great emotional component of involvement in BMS symptomatology. Nevertheless, there were positive results in some statistical analyses, thus encouraging further research in BMS laser therapy with other irradiation parameters.",Excluded
2558,"The effect of electromagnetic field emitted by a mobile phone on the inhibitory control of saccades. OBJECTIVE: To investigate whether exposure to a pulsed high-frequency electromagnetic field (pulsed EMF) emitted by a mobile phone has short-term effects on the inhibitory control of saccades., METHODS: A double-blind, counterbalanced crossover study design was employed. We assessed the performance of 10 normal subjects on antisaccade (AS) and cued saccade (CUED) tasks as well as two types of overlap saccade (OL1, OL2) task before and after 30 min of exposure to EMF emitted by a mobile phone or sham exposure., RESULTS: After EMF or sham exposure, we observed a slight but significant shortening of latency in the CUED and OL2 tasks. AS amplitude decreased as well as the saccade velocities in the AS, CUED, and OL1 tasks after exposure. These changes occurred regardless of whether exposure was real or sham. The frequencies of pro-saccades in the AS task, saccades to cue in the CUED task, and prematurely initiated saccades in the overlap (OL2) task did not change significantly after real or sham EMF exposure., CONCLUSIONS: Thirty minutes of mobile phone exposure has no significant short-term effect on the inhibitory control of saccades., SIGNIFICANCE: The cortical processing responsible for saccade inhibition is not affected by exposure to EMF emitted by a mobile phone.

1671,"Balloon-sacroplasty on patients with osteoporotic fatigue fractures. Introduction In patients with calcipenic osteopathy, fatigue fractures of the Os sacrum are relatively common and are typically accompanied by strong, disabling pain. The aim of our study was to verify the feasibility and safety of Sacroplasty by using a balloon catheter as well as the outcome of pain after the intervention. Material(s) and Method(s): 25 patients (20 women with an average age of 72.6 years, 5 men with an average age of 68.4 years) were diagnosed in a CT to have an Os sacrum fracture, in 12 women the fracture was unilateral, in the remaining patients bilateral. As a manifestation from an extant bone reconstruction process, all patients, through MRT strong T2 weighted images, were found to have distinctive oedema. In QCT results, all patients were found to have strong demineralisation of the vertebrae column with results from max 63mg/dl to min 13mg/dl, clinically, extreme pain is significant. On all patients, a CT controlled balloon sacroplasty was performed. During the intervention, the patient is in a ventral position, to enable the cement to be dispensed in a longitudinal angle to the fracture, and the balloon catheter is directed through a hollow needle in the Os sacrum either from the caudal to the cranial or from the craniodorsal to the caudoventral. The balloon catheter was accordingly de/inflated 1-3 times along the fracture in the appropriate direction, thus causing a cavity that was then filled with PMMA-cement under low pressure. A control-CT as well as a conventional X-ray was then carried out. The pain intensity was defined by means of VAS before the intervention, on the second day, after 6 and 12 months. Result(s): The balloon-sacroplasty enabled a good technical performance on every patient. The control-CT and the X-Ray control of the Os sacrum showed an adequate distribution of the cement, a cement leakage was not detected. Before the operation, the average pain encountered was according to the VAS 8.3. On the second postoperative day, a considerable reduction with an average of 2.7 was reported, this was still stable with an average of 2.5 after 6 and 12 months. Discussion(s): The Balloon-Sacroplasty is an effective treatment method for immediate pain relief and remobilisation in patients with fatigue fractures of the Os sacrum. Different approches as well as the utilisation of a balloon enables preferably large cement streams in the longitudinal direction of the fracture in the Os sacrums.",Excluded
2497,"Study design for a case-control investigation of cellular telephones and other risk factors for brain tumours in adults. The aetiology of brain tumours is poorly understood. Due, in part, to public concern about a postulated relationship between the use of cellular telephones or other increasingly prevalent environmental exposures and the incidence of brain cancer in adults, the National Cancer Institute is collaborating with three US hospitals in a comprehensive case-control study of malignant and benign brain tumours. Factors under consideration include use of cellular phones and other wireless communication devices, workplace exposures to chemical agents and electromagnetic fields, dietary factors, family history of tumours, genetic determinants of susceptibility, home appliance use, reproductive history and hormonal exposures, viruses, medical and dental exposure to ionising radiation, and other aspects of medical history. Approximately 800 newly diagnosed brain tumour cases and 800 controls were enrolled at hospitals in Boston, Phoenix and Pittsburgh from 1994 to 1998. Cases include all adults (age >= 18 y) newly diagnosed with a histologically confirmed intracranial glioma, histologically confirmed intracranial meningioma or acoustic neuroma. Controls are patients admitted to the same hospitals as the cases, and treated for any of a variety of non-malignant conditions. Key features of the study include its large size, the emphasis on rapid ascertainment of incident cases and interview of study subjects rather than surrogate respondents, the use of detailed, job-specific questions developed by industrial hygienists to ascertain occupational exposures, and the storage of blood samples for future evaluation of inherited susceptibility, biomarkers of exposure and gene-environment interactions.",Excluded
1724,"Assessment of Jugular Venous Blood Flow Stasis and Thrombosis during Spaceflight. Importance: Exposure to a weightless environment during spaceflight results in a chronic headward blood and tissue fluid shift compared with the upright posture on Earth, with unknown consequences to cerebral venous outflow. Objective(s): To assess internal jugular vein (IJV) flow and morphology during spaceflight and to investigate if lower body negative pressure is associated with reversing the headward fluid shift experienced during spaceflight. Design, Setting, and Participant(s): This prospective cohort study included 11 International Space Station crew members participating in long-duration spaceflight missions. Internal jugular vein measurements from before launch and approximately 40 days after landing were acquired in 3 positions: seated, supine, and 15degree head-down tilt. In-flight IJV measurements were acquired at approximately 50 days and 150 days into spaceflight during normal spaceflight conditions as well as during use of lower body negative pressure. Data were analyzed in June 2019. Exposures: Posture changes on Earth, spaceflight, and lower body negative pressure. Main Outcomes and Measures: Ultrasonographic assessments of IJV cross-sectional area, pressure, blood flow, and thrombus formation. Result(s): The 11 healthy crew members included in the study (mean [SD] age, 46.9 [6.3] years, 9 [82%] men) spent a mean (SD) of 210 (76) days in space. Mean IJV area increased from 9.8 (95% CI,-1.2 to 20.7) mm2 in the preflight seated position to 70.3 (95% CI, 59.3-81.2) mm2 during spaceflight (P <.001). Mean IJV pressure increased from the preflight seated position measurement of 5.1 (95% CI, 2.5-7.8) mm Hg to 21.1 (95% CI, 18.5-23.7) mm Hg during spaceflight (P <.001). Furthermore, stagnant or reverse flow in the IJV was observed in 6 crew members (55%) on approximate flight day 50. Notably, 1 crew member was found to have an occlusive IJV thrombus, and a potential partial IJV thrombus was identified in another crew member retrospectively. Lower body negative pressure was associated with improved blood flow in 10 of 17 sessions (59%) during spaceflight. Conclusions and Relevance: This cohort study found stagnant and retrograde blood flow associated with spaceflight in the IJVs of astronauts and IJV thrombosis in at least 1 astronaut, a newly discovered risk associated with spaceflight. Lower body negative pressure may be a promising countermeasure to enhance venous blood flow in the upper body during spaceflight.Copyright © 2019 JAMA Network Open.",Excluded
2334,"Minimally invasive radioguided parathyroidectomy. We reported here the data on minimally invasive radioguided parathyroidectomy (MIRP) in a large group of 253 patients enrolled from the whole series of 355 consecutive patients affected by primary hyperparathyroidism (P-HPT) referred to our center. On the basis of preoperative imaging including Sestamibi scintigraphy and neck ultrasound (US), 263 patients (74% of the whole series) with evidence of a solitary parathyroid adenoma (PA) and a normal thyroid gland were addressed to MIRP and in 253 (96%) of them this minimally invasive neck exploration was successfully performed. The MIRP protocol developed in our center consisted of a very low 1 mCi Sestamibi injection in the operating room a few minutes before the start of intervention, thus minimizing the radiation exposure dose to the patient and personnel. No major intraoperative complication was recorded in patients treated by MIRP and only a transient hypocalcemia in 8.5% of cases. The mean duration time for MIRP was 35 min and the mean hospital stay 1.2 days. Local anesthesia was also performed in 62 patients, 54 of whom were elderly patients with concomitant invalidating diseases contraindicating general anesthesia. No HPT relapse was observed during subsequent follow-up. The gamma probe was used also during bilateral neck exploration in the group of 92 patients excluded from MIRP. The most frequent cause of exclusion from MIRP in our series was the presence of concomitant Sestamibi avid thyroid nodules (68.5% of cases) that can give false positive results at radioguided surgery. In conclusion, MIRP is an effective treatment in patients with a high likelihood of a solitary PA and a normal thyroid gland at scintigraphy and US so that an accurate preoperative localizing imaging is required for MIRP. A low 1 mCi Sestamibi dose appears sufficient to perform MIRP. Patients with concomitant Sestamibi avid thyroid nodules should be excluded from MIRP. © 2006 Elsevier SAS.

1631,"Maternal effects of the scid mutation on radiation-induced transgenerational instability in mice. The results of a number of recent studies show that mutation rates in the offspring of irradiated parents are substantially elevated, however, the effect of parental genotype on transgenerational instability remains poorly understood. Here, we have analysed the mutation frequency at an expanded simple tandem repeat (ESTR) locus in the germline and bone marrow of the first-generation male offspring of control and irradiated male mice. The frequency of ESTR mutation was studied in the offspring of two reciprocal matings male symbol scid x female symbol BALB/c and male symbol BALB/c x female symbol scid, which were compared with that in BALB/c mice. In the offspring of the BALB/c x BALB/c and male symbol scid x female symbol BALB/c matings, which were conceived after paternal sperm irradiation, the frequency of ESTR mutation was significantly elevated in both tissues. In contrast, ESTR mutation frequency was only slightly elevated in the offspring of male symbol BALB/c x female symbol scid mating conceived after paternal irradiation. The results of this study suggest that the oocytes of scid females are unable to fully support the repair of double-strand breaks induced in paternal sperm which may in turn result in the elimination of cells/embryos containing high levels of DNA damage, thus partially preventing the manifestation of genomic instability.",Excluded
2336,"An approach to the assessment of risk from chronic radiation to populations of European lobster, Homarus gammarus (L.). The basic principles underlying a four-discrete age group, logistic, growth model for the European lobster Homarus gammarus are presented and discussed at proof-of-concept level. The model considers reproduction, removal by predation, natural death, fishing, radiation and migration. Non-stochastic effects of chronic low linear energy transfer (LET) radiation are modelled with emphasis on (99)Tc, using three endpoints: repairable radiation damage, impairment of reproductive ability and, at higher dose rates, mortality. An allometric approach for the calculation of LD(50/30) as a function of the mass of each life stage is used in model calibration. The model predicts that at a dose rate of 1 Gy day(-1), lobster population reproduction and survival become severely compromised, leading eventually to population extinction. At 0.01 Gy day(-1), the survival rate of an isolated population is reduced by 10%, mainly through loss of fecundity, comparable to natural migration losses. Fishing is the main ecological stress and only dose rates in the range 0.03-0.1 Gy day(-1) can achieve discernible effects above it. On the balance of radiation and other ecological stresses, a benchmark value of 0.01 Gy day(-1) is proposed for the protection of lobster populations. This value appears consistent with available information on radiation effects in wildlife.",Excluded
999,"Tape stripping the stratum corneum for biomarkers of ultraviolet radiation exposure at sub-erythemal dosages: a study in human volunteers. PURPOSE: Prevalence of skin cancer is rapidly increasing. There is a need for non-invasive biomarkers to assess efficacy of prevention strategies aiming at reduction of exposure to ultraviolet radiation (UVR). Recently, stratum corneum (SC) biomarkers were applied in various inflammatory skin diseases. Here, we explore their suitability as candidate biomarkers for UVR., MATERIAL AND METHODS: Twelve volunteers were exposed to a UVB-dose of 0.72 SED, three times a week, during three weeks. As candidate biomarkers, cis-isomers of urocanic acid (cUCA) and 25 immunological mediators were measured in the SC., RESULTS: Eight immunological markers significantly changed from baseline. Of them, IL-1RA/IL-1alpha and a placental growth factor (PIGF) showed gradual changes during UVR-exposure (p < 0.01 for linear trend). cUCA increased sharply already after the first exposure, however, reached a plateau in the second week., CONCLUSIONS: SC represents a promising, non-invasive alternative to skin biopsy in detecting UVR-induced changes. cUCA is the marker of choice for assessment of single UVR-exposure; however, it is less suitable for cumulative UVR-dose. Immunological markers including IL-1RA/IL-1alpha and PIGF showed gradual changes, and therefore are convenient for monitoring chronic UVR-exposure. These candidate biomarkers might facilitate assessment of the efficacy of preventive measures in the workplace and general population.",Excluded
529,"A clinical and proteomics approach to predict the presence of obstructive peripheral arterial disease: From the Catheter Sampled Blood Archive in Cardiovascular Diseases (CASABLANCA) Study. BACKGROUND: Peripheral arterial disease (PAD) is a global health problem that is frequently underdiagnosed and undertreated. Noninvasive tools to predict the presence and severity of PAD have limitations including inaccuracy, cost, or need for intravenous contrast and ionizing radiation., HYPOTHESIS: A clinical/biomarker score may offer an attractive alternative diagnostic method for PAD., METHODS: In a prospective cohort of 354 patients referred for diagnostic peripheral and/or coronary angiography, predictors of >=50% stenosis in >=1 peripheral vessel (carotid/subclavian, renal, or lower extremity arteries) were identified from >50 clinical variables and 109 biomarkers. Machine learning identified variables predictive of obstructive PAD; a score derived from the final model was developed., RESULTS: The score consisted of 1 clinical variable (history of hypertension) and 6 biomarkers (midkine, kidney injury molecule-1, interleukin-23, follicle-stimulating hormone, angiopoietin-1, and eotaxin-1). The model had an in-sample area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.85 for obstructive PAD and a cross-validated area under the curve of 0.84; higher scores were associated with greater severity of angiographic stenosis. At optimal cutoff, the score had 65% sensitivity, 88% specificity, 76% positive predictive value (PPV), and 81% negative predictive value (NPV) for obstructive PAD and performed consistently across vascular territories. Partitioning the score into 5 levels resulted in a PPV of 86% and NPV of 98% in the highest and lowest levels, respectively. Elevated score was associated with shorter time to revascularization during 4.3 years of follow-up., CONCLUSIONS: A clinical/biomarker score demonstrates high accuracy for predicting the presence of PAD.

1625,"Indeterminate nodules by the Bethesda system for reporting thyroid cytopathology in Israel: Frequency, and risk of malignancy after reclassification of follicular thyroid neoplasm with papillary-like features. Objective: We aimed to determine the frequency and risk of malignancy (ROM) for indeterminate thyroid nodules, categories III (B3) and IV (B4) of the Bethesda System for Reporting Thyroid Cytopathology (BSRTC), at a large institution in Israel. Additionally, we investigated the impact of redefining follicular neoplasm with papillary-like nuclear features (NIFTP) as non-malignant on malignancy rates. Method(s): In this retrospective study of all thyroid fine needle aspirations (FNAs) performed at Tel Aviv-Sourasky Medical Center between January 2013 and December 2015, we assessed ROM for B3 and B4 nodules. Potential risk factors thought to affect a-priori ROM were assessed. Suspected NIFTP lesions were re-examined, and if proven, reclassified as benign. Result(s): 3701 nodules were sampled in 2919 FNAs performed on 2674 patients. B3 reports comprised 7.7% of all nodules (n = 284); B4 represented 3.6% (n = 132). In multivariate logistic regression, male gender, being of former Soviet Union origin, and smoking increased ROM for B3 nodules by a factor of 7.97 (P = 0.002; CI: 2.2-23.4), 9.15 (P = 0.021; CI:1.4-60.0), and 11.0 (P = 0.001; CI 2.8-44.8), respectively. Reclassifying NIFTP decreased ROM from 14% to 12.5% for B3, and from 26.7% to 25% for B4 nodules. NIFTP comprised 9.5% of previously diagnosed resected malignant tumors. Conclusion(s): The relative frequencies of B3 and B4 nodules and their associated malignancy rates were consistent with previous series. Risk factors identified for malignancy may help characterize patients most likely to benefit from surgery. Reclassifying NIFTP had a substantial impact on the ROM in the resected tumors previously diagnosed as malignant.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd, BASO ~ The Association for Cancer Surgery, and the European Society of Surgical Oncology",Excluded
1061,"Gamma Knife surgery anterior capsulotomy for severe and refractory obsessive-compulsive disorder Clinical article. Object: Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is a challenging psychiatric condition associated with anxiety and ritualistic behaviors. Although medical management and psychiatric therapy are effective for many patients, severe and extreme cases may prove refractory to these approaches. The authors evaluated their experience with Gamma Knife (GK) capsulotomy in treating patients with severe OCD. Method(s): A retrospective review of an institutional review board-approved prospective clinical GK database was conducted for patients treated for severe OCD. All patients were evaluated preoperatively by at least one psychiatrist, and their condition was deemed refractory to pharmacological and psychiatric therapy. Result(s): Five patients were identified. Gamma Knife surgery with the GK Perfexion unit was used to target the anterior limb of the internal capsule bilaterally. A single 4-mm isocenter was used; maximum radiation doses of 140-160 Gy were delivered. All 5 patients were preoperatively and postoperatively assessed for clinical response by using both subjective and objective metrics, including the Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale (YBOCS); 4 of the 5 patients had postoperative radiological follow-up. The median clinical follow-up was 24 months (range 6-33 months). At the time of radiosurgery, all patients had YBOCS scores in the severe or extreme range (median 32, range 31-34). At the last follow-up, 4 (80%) of the 5 patients showed marked clinical improvement; in the remaining patient (20%), mild improvement was seen. The median YBOCS score was 13 (range 12-31) at the last follow-up. Neuroimaging studies at 6 months after GK treatment demonstrated a small area of enhancement corresponding to the site of the isocenter and some mild T2 signal changes in the internal capsule. No adverse clinical effects were noted from the radiosurgery. Conclusion(s): for patients with severe OCD refractory to medications and psychiatric therapy, GK capsulotomy afforded clinical improvement. Further study of this approach seems warranted. © AANS, 2013.",Excluded
2425,"Has the outlook improved for amifostine as a clinical radioprotector?. UNLABELLED: Amifostine has recently been approved for clinical radiotherapy as a protector against irradiation-induced xerostomia. It is our aim to review the outlook for using amifostine as a general clinical radioprotector. Protection against X-rays is mainly obtained by the scavenging of free radicals. The degree of protection is therefore highly dependent on oxygen tension, with protection factors ranging from 1 to 3. Maximal protection is observed at physiological levels of oxygenation. A great variability in protection has also been observed between different normal tissues. Some tissue, like brain, is not protected while salivary glands and bone marrow may exhibit a three-fold increase in radiation tolerance. Amifostine is dephosphorylized to its active metabolite by a process involving alkaline phosphatase. Due to lower levels of alkaline phosphatase in tumor vessels, amifostine is marketed as a selective protector of normal tissue and not tumors. However, the preclinical investigations concerning the selectivity of amifostine are controversial and the clinical studies are sparse and do not have the power to evaluate the influence of amifostine on the therapeutic index., CONCLUSION: based on the present knowledge amifostine should only be used in experimental protocols and not in routine practice.",Excluded

The inclusion criteria include closed capitellar fracture, normal anterior elbow joint movement before injury, and recent capitellar fracture with injury within past 3 weeks. Fractures classified according to Dubberley included four cases of type IB, eight cases of type IIB, and 12 cases of type IIIB. Radiographic evaluation was performed. Surgery time, blood loss, range of motion of the elbow, forearm rotation, and complications were recorded. Elbow joint function was evaluated by Mayo Elbow Performance Score (MEPS). Result(s): The mean follow-up period was 19.6 months (range, 12-36 months). The average clinical healing time for fractures was 11.2 +/- 3.2 weeks (range, 8-20 weeks). Fracture united in all patients. Two patients showed slight delayed union, but union was achieved eventually. The mean time from injury to surgery was 6.3 +/- 3.1 days (range, 2-15 days). The average surgical time was 68.1 +/- 11.5 min (range, 50-90 min), and the mean blood loss was 75.2 +/- 26.5 mL (range, 40-120 mL). The mean range of flexion was 122.5degree +/- 10.5degree(range, 95degree-140degree). The mean range of extension was 8.5degree +/- 5.8degree(range, 0degree-20degree). The mean range of pronation was 79.7degree +/- 8.0degree(range, 65degree-90degree). The mean range of supination was 80.5degree +/- 7.1degree(range, 60degree-90degree). The mean MEPS at final follow-up was 89.8 +/- 9.0 (range, 60-100). Based on the MEPS, 18 (75%) patients had excellent, five (20.8%) patients had good, and one (4.2%) patient had fair. None of the 24 patients suffered vascular or nerve injury. One patient showed superficial infection, which was treated with surgical dressing. Conclusion(s): The vertical or parallel technique of the micro-locking plate is an excellent method for treating Dubberley B-type capitellar fractures.Copyright © 2021 The Authors.

2059,"Deciphering acute shoulder trauma with normal initial X-ray: Contributions of ultrasonography and MRI. Introduction: Shoulder trauma with normal radiographs is a frequent emergency presentation. The predominance of pain makes clinical examination unreliable, and complementary imaging is often needed for diagnosis. The aim of the present study was to assess the contribution of ultrasonography (US) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in deciphering such trauma. The study hypothesis was that MRI can confirm most diagnoses and reveal occult lesions. Method(s): 48 patients with a median age of 33 years (IQR, 22-48.75), admitted to the Emergency Department between February and September 2016, were prospectively included. All had normal X-ray and underwent emergency and deferred emergency (D + 7-10) clinical examination, and US and MRI at D + 7-14. The same examinations were repeated to establish diagnosis and initiate treatment. MRI was considered as gold-standard for definite diagnosis. Result(s): Diagnoses comprised: 14 shoulder contusions; 13 rotator cuff tears; 8 acromioclavicular sprains; 6 fractures: 3 greater tuberosity, 2 humeral head, 1 lateral quarter of the clavicle; 3 subluxations or anterior dislocations with spontaneous reduction; 1 posterior dislocation with spontaneous reduction; 1 case of resorption of calcification in the pectoralis major tendon; 1 case of coracobrachialis strain; and 1 partial pectoralis major detachment. Concordance with final diagnosis was 42% (20/48) on initial clinical examination and 52% (25/48) on reassessment. On US, concordance was 71% (34/48), with 82% positive predictive value for cuff tear and 0% for instability. MRI was contributive in all cases, revealing 48 abnormal signals in 41 patients, thus establishing 48 diagnoses. Conclusion(s): Except in precise diagnostic situations such as rotator cuff tear, US is not a contributive examination, completely overlooking shoulder instability and bone contusion. MRI should play an increasing role in deciphering these traumas. Level of Evidence: II; prospective cohort study.Copyright © 2021 Elsevier Masson SAS",Excluded
1777,"Single-centre experience with nonmyeloablative allogeneic stem cell transplantation in patients with multiple myeloma: Prolonged remissions induced. Background: The role of allogeneic stem cell transplantation in multiple myeloma is not yet established. Method(s): We retrospectively evaluated the outcome of nonmyeloablative allogeneic stem cell transplantation (NMA) in patients with multiple myeloma treated at the Department of Haematology of the University Medical Centre Utrecht. Thirty-six patients received NMA as part of the first-line treatment; 23 patients as part of salvage therapy. Conditioning regimen was low-dose total body irradiation (TBI, 2 Grays) only; fludarabine was added in patients without previous autologous stem cell transplantation and patients with matched unrelated donors received antithymocyte globulin in addition to fludarabine and TBI. Result(s): Following NMA overall response increased from 84 to 90%, complete remission rate from 15 to 32%. As part of first-line treatment NMA induced complete remission in 50% of patients vs one patient (4%) treated for relapsed multiple myeloma. Median progression-free survival was 26 months (13 months for the salvage group, 38 months for the 'upfront' patients). Median overall survival has not been reached yet. The achievement of complete remission following NMA as part of first-line treatment was associated with prolonged progression-free and overall survival. Major toxicities were acute and chronic graft-vs-host disease occurring in 64% (23% grade 3-4) and in 54% (49% extensive) patients, respectively. Seven patients (12%) died from nonrelapse mortality, five patients (9%) directly related to toxicity of NMA. Conclusion(s): NMA in multiple myeloma is feasible, is associated with acceptable nonrelapse mortality and may induce prolonged complete remission. In pretreated patients the result of NMA is disappointing which urges new strategies. © 2007 Van Zuiden Communications B.V. All rights reserved.",Excluded
3252,"[Comparison of radiation dose reduction of prospective ECG-gated one beat scan using 320 area detector CT coronary angiography and prospective ECG-gated helical scan with high helical pitch (FlashScan) using 64 multidetector-row CT coronary angiography]. A high radiation dose associated with 64 multidetector-row computed tomography (64-MDCT) is a major concern for physicians and patients alike. A new 320 row area detector computed tomography (ADCT) can obtain a view of the entire heart with one rotation (0.35 s) without requiring the helical method. As such, ADCT is expected to reduce the radiation dose. We studied image quality and radiation dose of ADCT compared to that of 64-MDCT in patients with a low heart rate (HR<=60). Three hundred eighty-five consecutive patients underwent 64-MDCT and 379 patients, ADCT. Patients with an arrhythmia were excluded. Prospective ECG-gated helical scan with high HP (FlashScan) in 64 was used for MDCT and prospective ECG-gated conventional one beat scan, for 320-ADCT. Image quality was visually evaluated by an image quality score. Radiation dose was estimated by DLP (mGycm) for 64-MDCT and DLP.e (mGycm) for 320-ADCT. Radiation dose of 320-ADCT (208+/-48 mGycm) was significantly (P<0.0001) lower than that of 64-MDCT (484+/-112 mGycm), and image quality score of 320-ADCT (3.0+/-0.2) was significantly (P=0.0011) higher than that of 64-MDCT (2.9+/-0.4). Scan time of 320-ADCT (1.4+/-0.1 s) was also significantly (P<0.0001) shorter than that of 64-MDCT (6.8+/-0.6 s). 320-ADCT can achieve not only a reduction in radiation dose but also a superior image quality and shortening of scan time compared to 64-MDCT.",Excluded
899,"DW-MRI-guided dose escalation improves local control of locally advanced nasopharyngeal carcinoma treated with chemoradiotherapy. Background: Nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) is one of the most highly radiosensitive malignancies; however, some locally advanced NPC patients experienced local recurrence even though they received aggressive treatment regimens. Defining the tumor volume precisely is important to escalate the total dose required for the primary tumor. In this study, we aimed to investigate the feasibility and efficacy of dose escalation guided by DW-MRI in patients with locally advanced NPC. Patients and Methods: A total of 230 patients with locally advanced NPC treated with intensive modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) at Sichuan Cancer Hospital between January 2010 and January 2015 were enrolled in this retrospective study. All the patients were treated with all-course of simultaneous integrated boost-IMRT. DW-MRI-guided dose escalation with 2.2-2.5 Gy/F, qd for 1-3daysor1.2-1.5 Gy/F, bid for 1-3 days were prescribed to 123 patients. Survival and complication of the patients were evaluated, and multivariate analysis was performed. Result(s): The median follow-up of patients in the DW-MRI-guided dose-escalation group and the conventional group was 48 months (range 8-88 months) and 52 months (range 6-90 months), respectively. The 5-year overall survival rate, distant metastasis-free survival rate, progression-free survival, and local recurrence-free survival (LRFS) of patients in the dose-escalation group and the conventional group were 88% vs 82.5% (p = 0.244), 86.1% vs 83.3% (p = 0.741), 82.2% vs 76.6% (p = 0.286), and 89.1% vs 80.1% (p = 0.029), respectively. Multivariate analysis showed that dose escalation was independent prognostic factor for LRFS (HR 0.386, 95% CI 0.163-0.909, p = 0.03). Conclusion(s): DW-MRI-guided dose escalation is a feasible strategy to improve local control of patients with locally advanced NPC. The treatment-related complications are tolerable.Copyright © 2020 Huang et al.",Excluded

1250,"A retrospective review of pain control by a two-step irradiance schedule during topical ALA-photodynamic therapy of non-melanoma skin cancer. Background and Objective Photodynamic therapy (PDT) with topical delta-aminolevulinic acid (ALA) of non-melanoma skin cancers is often associated with treatment-limiting pain. A previous study on basal cell carcinomas (BCCs) at Roswell Park Cancer Institute evaluated a two-step irradiance scheme as a means of minimizing pain, preserving outcomes, and limiting treatment time. We used an initial low irradiance until 90% of the protoporphyrin IX was photobleached, followed by a high irradiance interval until the prescribed fluence was delivered. Success of this pilot investigation motivated integration of the protocol into routine practice. Here, we present a retrospective review of recent clinical experience in a broad patient population. Study Design/Materials and Methods This was a retrospective review of an existing dermatology database. Fourteen caucasion patients - nine men and five women, ages 18-80, with a total of 51 superficial and 73 nodular BCCs, and three Bowen's disease lesions - were included. ALA was applied to each lesion for approximately 4 hours. Lesions received an initial irradiance of 30-50 mW/cm2 for 20 J/cm2, followed by 150 mW/cm2 for a total fluence of 200-300 J/cm2. Pain was assessed using a visual analog scale (VAS). Clinical outcome was determined at 6-12 months. Results Median VAS scores were 1.0 for both irradiances. Five of 127 lesions required pain control with 1% xylocaine. Pain was strongly influenced by lesion location but not by lesion type, number, or size. Complete responses were achieved in 84.1% of BCCs, which compares favorably with reported results for single ALA-PDT treatments. Two of three Bowen's disease lesions showed a complete response. Complete responses for nodular BCCs were 37%, which are also within the range of reported outcomes. Conclusions A two-step irradiance protocol in ALA-PDT effectively minimizes pain, maintains excellent clinical outcomes in superficial lesions, and adds minimal treatment time. © 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",Excluded
992,"Dose, volume, and function relationships in parotid salivary glands following conformal and intensity-modulated irradiation of head and neck cancer. PURPOSE: To determine the relationships between the three-dimensional dose distributions in parotid glands and their saliva production, and to find the doses and irradiated volumes that permit preservation of the salivary flow following irradiation (RT)., METHODS AND MATERIALS: Eighty-eight patients with head and neck cancer irradiated with parotid-sparing conformal and multisegmental intensity modulation techniques between March 1994 and August 1997 participated in the study. The mean dose and the partial volumes receiving specified doses were determined for each gland from dose-volume histograms (DVHs). Nonstimulated and stimulated saliva flow rates were selectively measured from each parotid gland before RT and at 1, 3, 6, and 12 months after the completion of RT. The data were fit using a generalized linear model and the normal tissue complication probability (NTCP) model of Lyman-Kutcher. In the latter model, a ""severe complication"" was defined as salivary flow rate reduced to < or =25% pre-RT flow at 12 months., RESULTS: Saliva flow rates data were available for 152 parotid glands. Glands receiving a mean dose below or equal to a threshold (24 Gy for the unstimulated and 26 Gy for the stimulated saliva) showed substantial preservation of the flow rates following RT and continued to improve over time (to median 76% and 114% of pre-RT for the unstimulated and stimulated flow rates, respectively, at 12 months). In contrast, most glands receiving a mean dose higher than the threshold produced little saliva with no recovery over time. The output was not found to decrease as mean dose increased, as long as the threshold dose was not reached. Similarly, partial volume thresholds were found: 67%, 45%, and 24% gland volumes receiving more than 15 Gy, 30 Gy, and 45 Gy, respectively. The partial volume thresholds correlated highly with the mean dose and did not add significantly to a model predicting the saliva flow rate from the mean dose and the time since RT. The NTCP model parameters were found to be TD50 (the tolerance dose for 50% complications rate for whole organ irradiated uniformly) = 28.4 Gy, n (volume dependence parameter) = 1, and m (the slope of the dose/response relationship) = 0.18. Clinical factors including age, gender, pre-RT surgery, chemotherapy, and certain medical conditions were not found to be significantly associated with the salivary flow rates. Medications (diuretics, antidepressants, and narcotics) were found to adversely affect the unstimulated but not the stimulated flow rates., CONCLUSIONS: Dose/volume/function relationships in the parotid glands are characterized by dose and volume thresholds, steep dose/response relationships when the thresholds are reached, and a maximal volume dependence parameter in the NTCP model. A parotid gland mean dose of < or =26 Gy should be a planning goal if substantial sparing of the gland function is desired.",Excluded
3295,"Reinforcing the Importance and Feasibility of Implementing a Low-dose Protocol for CT-guided Biopsies. RATIONALE AND OBJECTIVES: This study sought to more definitely illustrate the impact and feasibility of implementing a low-dose protocol for computed tomography (CT)-guided biopsies using size-specific dose estimates and multivariate analyses., MATERIALS AND METHODS: Fifty consecutive CT-guided lung and extrapulmonary biopsies were reviewed before and after implementation of a low-dose protocol (200 patients total, mean age 61 +/- 15 years, 128 women). Analyses of variance with Bonferroni correction were used to compare standard and low-dose protocols in terms of patient demographics, physician experience, target lesion size, total dose-length product, total acquisitions, size-specific dose estimate, signal-to-noise ratio, contrast-to-noise ratio, and lesion conspicuity ratings. All procedures were performed on the same 16-slice CT scanner., RESULTS: Voluntary protocol adherence was 100% (lung) and 89% (extrapulmonary). The low-dose protocol achieved significantly lower total average dose-length product [(lung) 735.6 +/- 599.4 mGy x cm to 252.1 +/- 101.9 mGy x cm, P < .001; (extrapulmonary) 724.7 +/- 545.0 mGy x cm to 392.9 +/- 239.5 mGy x cm, P < .001] and size-specific dose estimate [(lung) 5.2 +/- 0.8 mGy x cm to 4.3 +/- 1.5 mGy, P < .001; (extrapulmonary) 10.1 +/- 6.7 mGy to 6.5 +/- 2.7 mGy, P < .001]. Only the change in protocol was independently associated with lower size-specific dose estimates when controlling for the other variables (P < .0001). This was achieved with no significant differences in signal-to-noise ratio, contrast-to-noise ratio, or lesion conspicuity., CONCLUSIONS: Implementation of a low-dose protocol for CT-guided biopsies resulted in 21% and 36% of size-specific dose estimate reduction for lung and extrapulmonary biopsies, respectively, with excellent adherence. Interventional and body radiologists should implement low dose CT-guidance protocols aiming to improve patient safety. Copyright © 2018 The Association of University Radiologists.

564,"The expression of PDGF-BB predicts curative effect in locally advanced esophageal squamous cell carcinoma treated by radiotherapy. Radiotherapy is the major approach and is well tolerated in locally advanced esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC). And nowadays, no effective biological markers have been identified for predicting the prognosis of patients with ESCC. Platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) is associated with a poor prognosis of various malignancies. The present study aimed to assess the effect of PDGF-BB on radiotherapeutic responses of ESCC and the underlying mechanisms of its roles in ESCC. Serum from 68 cases that received neoadjuvant or radical radiotherapy was obtained before and during radiotherapy. Gene expression analyses were validated by enzyme linked immunosorbent assay. The prognosis of patients with significantly reduced PDGF-BB was probably better than that of the others found in the progression-free survival and overall survival groups. Depletion of PDGFB significantly suppressed the proliferation, invasion and migration of cancer cells. Inhibiting PDGFB induced cellular apoptosis and promoted the sensitivity to ionizing radiation (IR). Furthermore, IR inhibited PDGF-BB-induced migration by blocking the PI3K/AKT pathway in ESCC cells. We found that the expression of PDGF-BB provided a possible model for predicting ESCC radiotherapy. It can also be used as a prognostic indicator for locally advanced ESCC that was treated by radiotherapy.",Excluded

The anatomic distribution of SCC and BCC and the SCC:BCC ratio were significantly different in the Irish population studied when compared to other major series. It was found that a significant proportion of SCCs and BCCs were not related to chronic sun exposure. As expected, only melanomas arising in lentigo maligna were associated with long-term irradiation. It is proposed that other environmental agents and genetic factors may also contribute to the high incidence of skin cancer in Ireland.",Excluded
1442,"The tolerance of proton radiotherapy - Preliminary results. Introduction. Because the specific proton beam dose distribution (i.e. the so-called 'Bragg curve'), proton radiotherapy ensures that the high-dose region is precisely confined to the target volume while minimizing the dose delivered to healthy tissues/critical organs surrounding the tumour or to those lying in the path of the proton beam. This method has been used for patients in Krakow since November 2016. Aim. To report the early tolerance outcomes to proton radiotherapy in patients completing their treatment just before the end of August 2017. Materials and methods. Study subjects were 47 patients who had completed their treatment before the end of August 2017 with a mean age of 41.6 years (range: 16-76, median: 40). The most frequent diagnoses were skull base tumours (22 pts. - 46.8%) and brain G1 or G2 gliomas (17 pts. - 36.2%), whereas the most frequent histological types were chordomas (17 pts. - 36.2%). Proton radiotherapy was administered by pencil beam scanning and consisted of using the intensity modulated proton therapy (IMPT) technique. The total dose given per cancer type averaged as follows: (i) 70 and 74 Gy(RBE), for respectively chodrosarcomas and chordomas, (ii) 54 Gy(RBE) for brain gliomas and (iii) 70 Gy(RBE) for paranasal sinuses tumours. Early tolerance was prospectively evaluated and measured according to the CTCAE scale, version 4.03. Results. In all, 91 side effects (SE) were recorded in 44 patients. The intensity of SEs were as following: 62 SEs (68.1%) were of grade 1 intensity, 21 SEs (23.1%) were of grade 2 and 8 SEs (8.8%) were of grade 3. The most frequently developed SEs were skin reactions (29 pts. - 61.7%) or oral/pharyngeal mucositis (20 pts. - 42.6%). Because the patient follow-up period was short, presented results only describes the early tolerance to this therapy. Our findings of mild intensities for the most early side effects, at (grades 1 or 2) are consistent with other published studies.Copyright © Polskie Towarzystwo Onkologiczne.",Excluded
1409,"Transoral endoscopic laser microsurgery or concurrent chemoradiation therapy for T2N0 larynx cancer. Purpose/Objective(s): To compare the effectiveness of transoral endoscopic laser microsurgery (TLM) and concurrent chemoradiation therapy (CCRT) in the management of T2N0 laryngeal cancer. Materials/Methods: This retrospective review enrolled 43 consecutive patients with T2N0 larynx cancer treated with definitive TLM (n = 25) or CCRT (n = 18) between 2005 and 2012. The tumor was located in the supraglottis in 9 patients, glottis in 31 patients, and subglottis in 3 patients. The mean cumulative radiation doses were 70 Gy for CCRT group and Cisplatin-based concurrent chemotherapies were the most commonly used regimens. Oncological outcomes were evaluated using local control (LC), regional control (RC), larynx preservation survival (LPS), disease free survival (DFS), cancer specific survival (CSS), and overall survival (OS). Result(s): The median follow-up time was 3.93 years for the survivors. Patients' characteristics between two groups had no statistically significant difference. The 5-year LRC rate for CCRT group was 94.4% significantly higher than the 64.1% for TLM group (p = 0.030). The 5-year DFS rate for CCRT group was significantly improved (78.5% vs 56.5%, p=0.040). There was no significant difference in LPS, CSS, and OS. The most significant risk factor for tumor recurrence was subglottic invasion with significantly poor 5-year LRC rate (50.9% vs 92.7%, p = 0.003). On multivariate analysis, subglottic invasion was the only significant factor predicting recurrence after definitive treatment. Conclusion(s): TLM and CCRT are both effective in terms of larynx preservation survival rate for T2N0 larynx cancer. However, CCRT may improve the local regional control and disease free survival rate. Tumor with subglottic invasion carries poor prognostic value for tumor control, further adjuvant therapy may be considered.",Excluded

Background: In this study, we aimed to compare the efficacy and clinical outcomes of shock wave lithotripsy (SWL) for patients with renal stones using pure fluoroscopy (FS) or ultrasound-assisted (USa) localization with two lithotripters. Method(s): We retrospectively identified 425 patients with renal calculi who underwent SWL with either a LiteMed LM-9200 ELMA lithotripter (209 cases), which combined ultrasound and fluoroscopic stone targeting or a Medispec EM-1000 lithotripter machine (216 cases), which used fluoroscopy for stone localization and tracking. The patient demographic data, stone-free rates, stone disintegration rates, retreatment rates and complication rates were analyzed. Result(s): The USa group had a significantly higher overall stone-free rate (43.6 vs. 28.2%, p < 0.001) and stone disintegration rate (85.6 vs. 64.3%, p < 0.001), as well as a significantly lower retreatment rate (14.8 vs. 35.6%, p < 0.001) and complication rate (1.9 vs. 5.5%, p = 0.031) compared with the FS group. This superiority remained significant in the stone size < 1 cm stratified group. In the stone size > 1 cm group, the stone-free rate (32.4 vs. 17.8%, p = 0.028), disintegration rate (89.2 vs. 54.8%, p = 0.031) and retreatment rate (21.6 vs. 53.4%, p < 0.001) were still significantly better in the USa group, however there was no significant difference in the complication rate. The most common complication was post-SWL-related flank pain. Conclusion(s): SWL is a safe and non-invasive way of treating renal stones.

3134,"Robustness of IMPT treatment plans with respect to inter-fractional set-up uncertainties: Impact of various beam arrangements for cranial targets. In the current study IMPT plan robustness was evaluated with respect to inter-fractional patient positioning for various beam arrangements and two tumor indications in the cranial region. Material and methods. For 14 patients suffering from tumors in the cranial region [skull base (SB; n = 7) and paranasal sinus (PS; n = 7)] the CTV and OARs were delineated. A safety margin of 3 mm was applied to the CTV. A prescribed dose of 2 GyE was planned via three beam arrangements (alpha, beta, gamma). Beam arrangement alpha consisted of lateral opposed fields for both tumor groups while beam arrangement beta was optimized according to respective tumor and OAR locations, using two beams only. Beam arrangement gamma applied four beams in the SB group and three beams in the PS group. Dose distributions were recalculated subjected to virtual patient translations along the major anatomical axes. The following dosimetric indices were evaluated and compared to original plans: target coverage (TC), target dose homogeneity (HI), CTV median and average dose (Dmedian, Dmean). For OARs near maximum dose and average dose (D2%, Dmean) were evaluated. Results. Dose distributions were distorted after introducing shifts. In the SB group, TC and HI were significantly different for caudal, cranial and anterior shifts for all beam arrangements. For PS patients, all but right shifts differed significantly from the original plans for all beam arrangements, although clinical relevance was not reached for arrangement gamma (DELTATC < 1.5%). In general, beam arrangement gamma exhibited the least spread of data regarding target indices and was consequently considered the most robust. Dosimetric parameters regarding the brainstem were mostly influenced by shifts along the anterio-posterior axis. Conclusion. For cranial IMPT, set-up uncertainties may lead to pronounced deterioration of dose distributions. According to our investigations, multi-beam arrangements were dosimetrically more robust and hence preferable over two beam arrangements. © 2013 Informa Healthcare.",Excluded

CONTEXT: Exacerbation of Graves' orbitopathy (GO) after radioiodine (RAI) therapy has been examined in some populations but has not been fully described in Japanese populations., OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to clarify the characteristics of GO exacerbation after RAI therapy and the effectiveness of low-dose prophylactic corticosteroid (PCS)., DESIGN AND SETTING: This was a prospective randomized study in Tokyo, Japan., PATIENTS: Between June 2011 and June 2012, 295 patients with Graves' disease with either inactive GO or no GO received RAI therapy. Of these, 147 received no PCS (PCS-Off group), whereas 148 received low-dose PCS (starting dose, 15 mg/day of prednisolone) for 6 weeks (PCS-On group). We used magnetic resonance imaging to thoroughly evaluate GO before and 1 year after RAI therapy., MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Outcomes of GO 1 year after RAI therapy were determined., RESULTS: GO exacerbation occurred in 29 patients (9.8%), and only 7 patients (2.4%) required ophthalmic treatment. No significant difference in the frequency of GO exacerbation was seen between the groups (PCS-On group: n = 18 [12.1%]; PCS-Off group: n = 11 [7.5%]; P = .17). Significant prognostic factors were identified as thyroid-stimulating antibody (by 100% linear increase: risk ratio, 1.15; 95% confidence interval, 1.07-1.24; P = .0003) and clinical activity score (>=1 vs 0: risk ratio, 6.40; 95% confidence interval, 2.17-19.7; P = .0009)., CONCLUSION: Exacerbation of GO after RAI therapy in the Japanese population appears less common than in other populations.

370,Cord blood transplantation using minimum conditioning regimens for patients with hematologic malignancies complicated by severe infections. Patients with severe infections are thought to be ineligible for cord blood stem cell transplantation (CBT) because the conventional 5-6 day-conditioning regimens potentially makes them susceptible to fatal infections by the time neutrophil engraftment occurs. Two patients were treated with minimum conditioning regimens consisting of 30 mg/m2 fludarabin (Flu) and 2 g/m2 cyclophosphamide (CY) on day-1 and total body irradiation (TBI) of 2 or 4 Gy on day -1 or 0 followed by single unit CBT. The reasons for adopting such weak regimen were febrile neutropenia due to the rejection of the first cord blood (CB) graft given to a patient with follicular lymphoma resistant to chemotherapy and pulmonary aspergillosis in another patient with AML who relapsed after CBT. The AML patient received 40 mg/m2 of melphalan on day-2 to reduce the leukemia burden. Both patients achieved 100% donor chimerism by day 19 and day 20 after CBT without an apparent exacerbation of the infections and remained in remission at 23 and 18 months after the CBT. These findings suggest that the 1-2 day regimens excluding antihuman thymocyte globulin may be sufficiently potent to ensure engraftment of CB in immunocompromised patients and safely administered even when patients are complicated by active infections. © 2008 The Japanese Society of Hematology.,Excluded
3145,"Dosimetric coverage of the external anal sphincter by 3-dimensional conformal fields in rectal cancer patients receiving neoadjuvant chemoradiation: implications for the concept of sphincter-preserving radiation therapy. BACKGROUND: We evaluated the anatomic location of the external anal sphincter (EAS) to pelvic bony landmarks related to 3-dimensional conformal radiotherapy (3DRT) and studied the dosimetric coverage of the EAS in patients undergoing neoadjuvant chemoradiation for rectal cancer., METHODS: Sixty-four consecutive rectal cancer patients treated with neoadjuvant chemoradiation were included. All patients were treated in a prone position on a bellyboard by 3DRT. The inferior border of the RT fields was at least 3-5 cm inferior to the gross tumorous volume (GTV) or at the inferior border of the obturator foramen (IBOF), whichever was more inferior. The EAS was contoured and dose distributions were determined using dose-volume histograms., RESULTS: In 53 out of 64 cases (82.8%), the EAS was completely inferior to the IBOF. In the remaining 11 cases, the EAS was either overlapping the IBOF (10 cases; 15.6%) or completely superior to the IBOF (1 case; 1.7%). The average mean dose delivered to the EAS was 2795 cGy. Lower mean doses were delivered to the EAS when the center of the EAS was located more distant from the GTV., CONCLUSIONS: Meticulous planning to define the inferior border of the RT field is recommended to avoid irradiating the EAS.",Excluded
276,"Development of hypothyroidism during long-term follow-up of patients with toxic nodular goitre after radioiodine therapy. Objective To investigate the cure rate and incidence of hypothyroidism of radioiodine treatment with a calculated dose regimen and an intended thyroid dose of 150 Gy in patients with toxic nodular goitre during long-term follow-up. Patients A total of 265 consecutive patients with toxic nodular goitre were treated between March 2003 and August 2004 at our institute and followed up for a maximum of 8 years. Preliminary radioiodine testing with volumetric measurement of the thyroid by ultrasound as well as individual thyroidal radioiodine uptake and half-life measurements were performed before radioiodine therapy. The estimated radiation dose to the thyroid was 150 Gy. Measurements Follow-up controls with respect to success of therapy and development of hypothyroidism were performed 3 months, 1 and up to 8 years after radioiodine treatment. The relation of the achieved thyroid dose to the success rate of treatment and to the incidence of hypothyroidism was analysed. Results The cure rates were 85% at 3 months, 98% at 1 year and 98% at the end of follow-up. Above an achieved thyroid dose of more than 120 Gy, there was no significant association between the dose achieved in the thyroid and the cure rate on follow-up. The incidences of hypothyroidism at 3 months, at 1 year and at the end of follow-up were 32%, 55% and 73%, respectively. Conclusions Radioiodine treatment with a calculated dose regimen is a highly effective treatment option in patients with toxic goitre with an overall success rate of 98%. However, radioiodine treatment with an intended thyroid dose of 150 Gy leads to a high incidence of hypothyroidism on long-term follow-up. This finding supports the suggestion that in future intended thyroid doses could be lowered in patients treated with a calculated dose regimen for toxic nodular goitre. © 2011 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.",Excluded
3663,"Irradiation field design according to locoregional relapse sites after radiotherapy of nasopharyngeal carcinoma. BACKGROUND & OBJECTIVE: The lateral faciocervical field, lateral facial field, and cerrobent blocks were employed conventionally in radiotherapy of nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) in Cancer Center of Sun Yat-sen University since 1990s. This study was to explore rationality of irradiated area of lateral faciocervical field and lateral facial field through analyzing the data of some patients presenting locoregional recurrence after conventional radiotherapy. METHOD(S): Clinical data of the patients, treated in 1999 and presented locoregional failure and had reports of CT examinations before and after radiotherapy and after recurrence, were reviewed. The regions of recurrent lesions were analyzed. Dosimetric analysis of recurrent regions was performed for the patients with available data of irradiating fields. If no less than 95% of the volume of local recurrent lesion was within 95% isodose curve, it was defined as in-field failure; 20% to less than 95% of the volume was within 95% isodose curve as marginal failure; less than 20% of the volume was within 95% isodose curve as out-field failure. RESULT(S): Clinical data of 40 patients could be analyzed, and dosimetric analysis of recurrent regions was performed for 15 patients. Local recurrences mainly occurred in the nasopharyngeal cavity and the skull base bone. Dosimetric analysis showed 9 cases of in-field failure, 4 cases of marginal failure, and 2 cases of out-field failure. For the 6 cases of marginal and out-field failure, the main reasons of recurrence were low dose area in target volume due to not strictly following the guidelines of defining field limit, or inappropriately estimating the involved regions of lesions. CONCLUSION(S): Irradiated area of lateral faciocervical field and lateral facial field employed conventionally in radiotherapy of NPC is rational.",Excluded
414,"Dosimetric evaluation of intensity modulated radiotherapy and three-dimensional conformal radiotherapy treatment plans for prostate cancer. OBJECTIVE We evaluated the homogeneity index and conformity index using intensity modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) and three-dimensional conformal radiotherapy (3D-CRT) treatment plans in prostate cancer. METHODS Twenty treatment plans for ten patients were created using 3D-CRT of four-fields with gantry angles of 0, 90, 180, and 270; and IMRT of five-fields with gantry angles of 0, 72, 144, 216, and 288 on an Eclipse Treatment Planning System (version 15.6). The volume of reference isodose, target volume, maximum isodose in the target, reference isodose, dose at 95% of planning target volume (PTV), dose at 2%, 5%, and 98% of PTV, and prescribed dose were collected from the dose volume histogram of each plan. The conformity index and homogeneity index (HI) were then calculated. The doses of the organs at risk were also collected and evaluated. RESULTS The HI of the twenty patients who underwent the treatment plan with 3D-CRT was 1.088+/-0.03, which shows good homogeneity, but less homogeneity when compared with plans done with IMRT (1.072+/-0.02). CONCLUSION The use of IMRT treatment plan for prostate cancer proved to be superior over 3D-CRT in terms of conformity and homogeneity, as well as sparring dose to organ at risk.Copyright © 2021, Turkish Society for Radiation Oncology.",Excluded

916,"Neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy of rectal carcinoma: Baseline hematologic parameters influencing outcomes. Background: The link between the blood count and a systemic inflammatory response (SIR) is indisputable and well described. Pretreatment hematological parameters may predict the overall clinical outcomes in many types of cancer. Thus, this study aims to systematically evaluate the relationship between baseline blood count levels and treatment response in rectal cancer patients treated with neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy. Patients and Methods: From 2009-2015, 173 patients with locally advanced rectal cancer were retrospectively enrolled in the study and analyzed. The baseline blood count was recorded in all patients 1 week before chemoradiation. Tumor response was evaluated through pathologic findings. Blood count levels which included RBC (red blood cells), Hb (hemoglobin), PLT (platelet count), neutrophil count, WBC (white blood cells), NLR (neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio), and PLR (platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio) were analyzed in relation to tumor downstaging, pCR (pathologic complete response), OS (overall survival), and DFS (disease-free survival). Result(s): Hb levels were associated with a response in logistic regression analysis: pCR (p = 0.05; OR 1.04, 95 % CI 1.00-1.07); T downstaging (p = 0.006; OR 1.03, 95 % CI 1.01-1.05); N downstaging (p = 0.09; OR 1.02, 95 % CI 1.00-1.04); T or N downstaging (p = 0.007; OR 1.04, 95 % CI 1.01-1.07); T and N downstaging (p = 0.02; OR 1.02, 95 % CI 1.00-1.04); Hb and RBC were the most significant parameters influencing OS; PLT was a negative prognostic factor for OS and DFS (p = 0.008 for OS); an NLR value of 2.8 was associated with the greatest significance for OS (p = 0.03) and primary tumor downstaging (p = 0.02).

656,"The perceived transmittance of inhomogeneous surfaces and media. A series of experiments was performed to determine how the visual system computes the transmittance of inhomogeneous surfaces and media. Previous work (Anderson, B. L. (1999) Stereoscopic surface perception. Neuron, 26, 919-928; Anderson, B. L. (2003) The role of occlusion in the perception of depth, lightness, and opacity. Psychological Review, 110, 762-784) has suggested that the visual system employs a transmittance anchoring principle in determining when transparency is perceived. This principle states that the visual system interprets the highest contrast region along contours and surfaces as a region in plain view and uses this anchor as a reference point for transparency computations. In particular, recent work has shown that the transmittance of homogeneous transparent surfaces is well described by a ratio of contrasts model (Singh, M., & Anderson, B. L. (2002). Toward a perceptual theory of transparency. Psychological Review, 109, 492-519). In this model, the transmittance of a transparent surface is determined by the contrast of a transparent image region normalized by the contrast of the region in plain view. Here, a series of experiments is reported that assesses this model for inhomogeneous transparent surfaces that vary in both space and time. The results of these experiments reveal that transmittance anchoring has both a spatial and temporal component, and that the perceived transmittance of transparent surfaces is well described by a ratio of perceived contrasts model.",Excluded

Background:Most patients with glioblastoma are older than 60 years, but treatment guidelines are based on trials in patients aged only up to 70 years. We did this trial to assess the impact of short schedule radiotherapy in patients aged 60 years and older with glioblastoma. Patients & Methods: Fifty patients aged 60 years or older with a Karnofsky Performance Status (KPS) greater than or equal to 70 were treated with postoperative hypofractionated radiotherapy (34Gy administered in 3.4Gy fractions over 2 weeks). The primary endpoint of the study was overall survival. The secondary endpoints were progression-free survival, and tolerance to treatment. Result(s): The median age at surgery was 71 years (range 60-81). No patient received prior or concomitant chemotherapy. At a median follow-up of 12.5 months, the median progressionfree survival and overall survival were 5.8 months (95% CI, 4.1-7.9) and 10 months (95% CI, 8.9-11.1) respectively. Type of surgery (total resection vs. subtotal vs. biopsy) remained a prognostic factor (p=0.034).

PURPOSE: To analyze acute esophagitis (AE) in a Chinese population receiving 3D conformal radiotherapy (3DCRT) for non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), combined or not with chemotherapy (CT), using the Lyman-Kutcher-Burman (LKB) normal tissue complication probability (NTCP) model., MATERIALS AND METHODS: 157 Chinese patients (pts) presented with NSCLC received 3DCRT: alone (34 pts) or combined with sequential CT (59 pts) (group 1) or with concomitant CT (64 pts) (group 2). Parameters (TD(50), n, and m) of the LKB NTCP model predicting for>grade 2 AE (RTOG grading) were identified using maximum likelihood analysis. Univariate and multivariate analyses using a binary regression logistic model were performed to identify patient, tumor and dosimetric predictors of AE., RESULTS: Grade 2 or 3 AE occurred in 24% and 52% of pts in group 1 and 2, respectively (p<0.001). For the 93 group 1 pts, the fitted LKB model parameters were: m=0.15, n=0.29 and TD(50)=46 Gy. For the 64 group 2 pts, the parameters were: m=0.42, n=0.09 and TD(50)=36 Gy. In multivariate analysis, the only significant predictors of AE were: NTCP (p<0.001) and V(50), as continuous variable (RR=1.03, p=0.03) or being more than a threshold value of 11% (RR=3.6, p=0.009)., CONCLUSIONS: A LKB NTCP model has been established to predict AE in a Chinese population, receiving thoracic RT, alone or combined with CT. The parameters of the models appear slightly different than the previous one described in Western countries, with a lower volume effect for Chinese patients. Copyright © 2010 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

We evaluated the impact of collimation to the 'minimal required field size' on clinically significant parameters of radiation exposure.Methods and resultsRadiation dose measured by dose area product (DAP) and radiation dose rate measured by DAP per minute of fluoroscopy were determined for all 571 electrophysiology procedures performed in a single electrophysiology laboratory from January 2010 to December 2010. Data from 205 procedures performed by one interventional electrophysiologist, who instituted a practice of routinely collimating to the minimum required visual fluoroscopy field on a case-by-case basis, were compared with data from 366 procedures performed by the three other experienced interventional electrophysiologists using the laboratory who continued their existing practice of ad hoc collimation. Significant reductions in radiation exposure were seen with the practice of routine maximal collimation. The largest reductions were seen during 'simple' ablation procedures.ConclusionA practice of routinely collimating to the minimum required visual fluoroscopy field results in significant reductions in radiation exposure when compared with a usual approach to collimation. This may have important implications for risk of malignancy in patients and operators. © 2012 Published on behalf of the European Society of Cardiology. All rights reserved. © The Author 2012.

1244,"Timed barium swallow and its usefullness in achalasia and non-achalasia dysphagia. Introduction: Timed barium swallow (TBS) was initially described by researchers at the Cleveland Clinic (AJR 1997). This test was designed to assess esophageal emptying in patients (pts) with achalasia before and after therapy, i.e. pneumatic dilation/ surgical myotomy. Over time it became part of standard workup at our Swallowing Center in all dysphagia cases. It is simple to perform, radiation exposure is minimal and it gives details on both esophageal anatomy and emptying of liquids and tablet. Our aim was to determine the usefulness of TBS in pts with non-achalasia dysphagia in comparison to achalasia pts. Method(s): Retrospective review of medical records of 150 consecutive pts who underwent TBS evaluation between 04/2014 and 09/2015 at our Institution. Pts were separated into achalasia and non-achalasia groups. Diagnosis of achalasia established by high resolution manometry. Standard protocol was used for all TBS. After drinking 6-8 oz of low density barium in the standing position, lateral film obtained followed by two-on-one spot films at 1 and 5 min. to assess liquid emptying. The esophagus was rinsed with water followed by ingestion of a 13 mm tablet. Tablet passage evaluated after 5 minutes with an abnormal test being tablet retention. TBS for liquid barium considered normal if < 1 cm of barium retention after 1 min in distal esophagus. One radiologist (JF) interpreted all TBS. Result(s): 72 pts (49% females) with achalasia/ mean age 57 years (type 1: 12 pts (17%), type 2: 35 pts (49%), type 3: 7 pts (10%), achalasia type not specified 18 pts (24%)) and 78 pts (62% females) without achalasia/ mean age of 62.25 years. Table 1 defines final diagnoses in non-achalasia pts. Achalasia pts more frequently had abnormal TBS than non-achalasia pts (96% vs. 65%, p < 0.0001). Table 2: characteristics of TBS in both groups. Non-esophageal findings identified on TBS in 10% of achalasia and in 20% of non-achalasia pts including musculoskeletal lesions (20 pts), lung nodule (5 pts), hilar prominence or calcifications (4 pts) and cardiomegaly or aortic calcifications (4 pts). Lung cancer found in 1 non-achalasia patient. Conclusion(s): 1. TBS is a simple and useful test in separation of achalasia and non-achalasia dysphagia. 2. Pts with achalasia are more likely to have abnormal TBS for barium liquid and tablet than non -achalasia dysphagia pts. 3. Pts with non-achalasia dysphagia are more likely to have abnormal TBS either for liquid barium or tablet only than achalasia pts.",Excluded
871,"Photodynamic therapy for intractable bronchial lung cancer. Objective: To investigate the effectiveness and side effects of photofrin-photodynamic therapy (PDT) for intractable bronchial lung cancer. Method(s): Thirty patients were classified as stage II-IV intractable bronchial lung cancer with lumen obstruction after they failed previous treatment regimens such as surgery, radiotherapy and chemotherapy. PDT was performed with 630. nm laser light (Diomed) delivered through cylinder diffusing tip quartz fibers that was passed through the biopsy channel of a flexible endoscope 48. h after intravenous injection of the photosensitizer photofrin (2. mg/kg body weight). 72. h after the first irradiation, the endoscopic procedure was repeated, necrotic tissues were mechanically removed and the deep original lesions and newly exposed cancer lesions were re-treated, and, if necessary, the areas were cleaned repeatedly. Result(s): The total response rate CR. +. PR was 86.7%, and the mean percentage of obstruction due to tumors at different treated sites decreased from 90% to 16.7% at discharge after PDT. The KPS score was significantly improved after PDT.

1906,"Structural Brain Changes following Long-Term 6degree Head-Down Tilt Bed Rest as an Analog for Spaceflight. BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Following long-term spaceflight, a subset of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration astronauts present with visual impairment and increased intracranial pressure, known as visual impairment and intracranial pressure syndrome. We investigated structural brain changes following long-term head-down tilt bed rest as a spaceflight analog., MATERIALS AND METHODS: Volumetric analysis was performed on structural pre- and post-bed rest brain MR images., RESULTS: Comparing post-bed rest to pre-bed rest images, we found the following: 1) no significant group differences in GM, WM, CSF, or ventricular volumes; 2) shift of the center of mass of the brain upward and posterior rotation of the brain relative to the skull; 3) a significant correlation between posterior brain rotation and changes in ventricular volume; and 4) significant increases in brain tissue density in regions at the vertex, including the frontoparietal lobes, with contraction of adjacent extra-axial CSF spaces, and significant decreases in tissue density in areas along the base of the brain, including the orbitofrontal cortex., CONCLUSIONS: We observed widespread morphologic changes with brain tissue redistribution in response to gravity changes; possible associated functional changes are unknown. The observation that ventricular change is correlated to posterior brain rotation suggests an alteration in CSF homeostasis. Ultimately, to elucidate any structural changes that may play a role in visual impairment and intracranial pressure syndrome, volumetric analysis of pre- and postflight structural scans of astronauts is needed.

2061,"Patient-Centered Outcomes Related to Imaging Testing in US Primary Care. Background: Imaging tests are one of the most sophisticated types of diagnostic tools used in health care, yet there are concerns that imaging is overused. Currently, tests are typically evaluated and implemented based on their accuracy, and there is limited knowledge about the range of patient-centered outcomes (PCOs) that imaging tests may lead to. This study explores patients' experiences and subsequent outcomes of imaging tests most notable to patients. Method(s): Adult patients from four primary care clinics who had an x-ray, CT, MRI, or ultrasound in the 12 months before recruitment participated in a single semistructured interview to recount their imaging experience. Interview transcripts were analyzed thematically. Result(s): Four themes related to PCOs were identified from 45 interviews. Participants' mean age was 53 years (25-83 years), 30 had undergone a diagnostic imaging test, and 15 underwent imaging for screening or monitoring. Themes included knowledge gained from the imaging test, its contribution to their overall health care journey, physical experiences during the test procedure, and impacts of the testing process on emotions. Conclusion(s): Patients identified various imaging test outcomes that were important to them. Measurement and reporting these outcomes should be considered more often in diagnostic research. Tools for providers and patients to discuss and utilize these outcomes may help promote shared decision making around the use and impact of imaging tests.Copyright © 2018",Excluded
3138,"Management of mediastinal relapse after treatment with stereotactic body radiotherapy or accelerated hypofractionated radiotherapy for stage I/II non-small-cell lung cancer. Purpose/Objective(s): Regional failures occur in up to 15% of patients treated with stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) for stage I/II lung cancer. This report focuses on the management of the unique scenario of isolated regional failures. Method(s): Patients treated initially with SBRT or accelerated hypofractionated radiotherapy were screened for curative intent treatment of isolated mediastinal failures (IMFs). Local control, regional control, progression-free survival, and distant control were estimated from the date of salvage treatment using the Kaplan-Meier method. Result(s): Among 160 patients treated from 2002 to 2012, 12 suffered IMF and were amenable to salvage treatment. The median interval between treatments was 16 months (2-57 mo). Median salvage dose was 66 Gy (60-70 Gy). With a median follow-up of 10 months, the median overall survival was 15 months (95% confidence interval, 5.8-37 mo). When estimated from original treatment, the median overall survival was 38 months (95% confidence interval, 17-71 mo). No subsequent regional failures occurred. Distant failure was the predominant mode of relapse following salvage for IMF with a 2-year distant control rate of 38%. At the time of this analysis, three patients have died without recurrence while four are alive and no evidence of disease. High-grade toxicity was uncommon. Conclusion(s): To our knowledge, this is first analysis of salvage mediastinal radiation after SBRT or accelerated hypofractionated radiotherapy in lung cancer. Outcomes appear similar to stage III disease at presentation. Distant failures were common, suggesting a role for concurrent or sequential chemotherapy. A standard full course of external beam radiotherapy is advisable in this unique clinical scenario.© Copyright 2015 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc. All rights reserved.",Excluded
2754,"Microvascular decompression after gamma knife surgery for trigeminal neuralgia: intraoperative findings and treatment outcomes. OBJECT: The authors sought to determine whether the results of trigeminal microvascular decompression (MVD) are influenced by prior gamma knife surgery (GKS). METHOD(S): Gamma knife surgery is an established procedure for treating medically intractable trigeminal neuralgia but failures do occur. The authors assessed six patients (two men and four women; mean age 52 years) who experienced pain recurrence after GKS and elected to undergo trigeminal MVD via retrosigmoid craniotomy. Three patients underwent a single GKS to a maximal dose of 80 Gy, whereas three others underwent a second GKS to total of 120 to 135 Gy. At surgery, none of the six patients demonstrated excess arachnoid thickening, grossly apparent changes in the nerve itself, or any other tissue alterations that made successful mobilization of a blood vessel from the trigeminal root entry zone technically more difficult. A single individual had a small atherosclerotic plaque in the superior cerebellar artery near its contact point with the trigeminal nerve. Follow up at a mean of 25.4 months (range 7.5-42 months) indicated that five patients were pain free. One patient had improved but still relied on medications for pain control. CONCLUSION(S): In the authors' experience, trigeminal MVD can be performed without added difficulty in patients who have previously undergone GKS. The success rates seem similar to those normally associated with MVD. Patients who elect the less invasive option of GKS can be assured that trigeminal MVD remains a viable alternative at a later date if further surgery is required.",Excluded

The objective of this study was to investigate the correlation between local recurrence and radiotherapeutic parameters, including dose and RT radiotherapy (RT) field. METHODS. The current study included 35 patients who were diagnosed with immunohistochemically confirmed nasal natural killer (NK)/T-cell lymphoma between 1976 and 2004. There were 21 males and 14 females, and they ranged in age from 18 years to 76 years (median, 51 yrs). The primary tumor originated in the nasal cavity in 28 patients, and 32 patients had Stage I disease. Seventeen patients received treatment solely with RT, and the remaining 18 patients received a combination of chemotherapy and RT. The median tumor dose was 50 grays (Gy) (range, 22-60 Gy). Twenty-seven patients received RT to include all macroscopic lesions, all paranasal sinuses, the palate, and the nasopharynx. Eight patients received RT to all macroscopic lesions with generous margins. RESULTS. A complete remission (CR) or a CR/unconfirmed was achieved in 28 patients (80%). The 5-year overall survival (OAS) rate, disease-free survival (DFS) rate, and local control probability (LCP) were 47.3%, 42.9%, and 65.2%, respectively. Patients who received RT only to macroscopic lesions fared less well in terms of LCP (LCP 5 years, 71.9% vs. 41.7%; P = 0.007). The difference in RT field also affected both the OAS rate and the DFS rate. Patients who received RT doses >= 50 Gy tended to achieve favorable local control. CONCLUSIONS. In the management of nasal NK/T-cell lymphoma, the RT field affected treatment outcomes. RT doses >= 50 Gy resulted in favorable local control. © 2005 American Cancer Society.",Excluded
353,"New effective dose estimates for Rubidium-82 based on dynamic PET/CT imaging in humans. Objectives Published radiation dose estimates for Rubidium-82 vary widely, and no comprehensive study in man has yet been conducted. With the increasing use of Rb-82 PET for myocardial perfusion imaging, improved dosimetry information is needed for accurate risk assessment. The purpose of this study was to measure Rb-82 internal organ and effective doses with PET/CT in humans. Methods We recruited 26 cardiac patients and 4 normal subjects with no cardiac history. Dynamic 3D PET scans were acquired (GE Discovery RX/VCT) over 10 minutes following IV injection of 10 MBq/kg Rb-82. Images were reconstructed using FORE-OSEM and 8 mm Hann filter. Cardiac scans of the chest were acquired at rest for all 30 subjects, plus one additional scan of the Head, Neck, Abdomen, Pelvis, or Thighs. Mean Rb-82 residence times were determined in 22 source organs using volumes-of-interest (VOI) drawn on the fused PET/CT images. For large organs a small VOI was used to avoid partial volume losses. For small organs the average activity above 80% threshold was multiplied by the volume at 40% of the peak value within the organ VOI. Target organ doses and the effective dose estimate were calculated using OLINDA/EXM 1.0 according to ICRP 60, and recalculated according to ICRP 103. Results A total of 283 organs were measured across the 60 scans, with at least 4 samples obtained in each source organ. The average 'adult' effective dose for Rubidium-82 was found to be 0.00074 mSv/MBq using ICRP 60. Using ICRP 103, the male and female effective doses were 0.00074 and 0.00092 mSv/MBq respectively. The highest absorbed organ dose was to the kidneys. Conclusions These dose estimates for Rubidium-82 are the first to be measured directly with PET/CT in humans, and are 4 to 4.5 times lower than previous ICRP 60 values based on a theoretical blood flow model. The new values derived from human studies suggest a typical effective dose of 0.6 mSv per scan with 3D PET.",Excluded
291,"Preoperative intensified radiochemotherapy for rectal cancer: Experience of a single institution. Purpose: The aim of our study was to evaluate the feasibility and the effectiveness of an intensified neoadjuvant protocol with the addition of weekly oxaliplatin in the preoperative strategy of rectal cancer treatment. Patients and Methods: Patients with locally advanced rectal cancer received continous infusion 5-Fluorouracil (5-FU) 200 mg/m2/day in combination with weekly oxaliplatin at a dose of 50 mg/m2. Doses of radiotherapy were 45 Gy to the whole pelvis plus 5.4-9 Gy to the tumour mass. The primary end-points of the study were evaluation of toxicity, compliance with radiotherapy and chemotherapy, downstaging, pathological complete response (pCR) and the rate of sphincter preservation for distal cancers. Secondary end-points were relapse-free and overall survival. Result(s): From November 2006 to June 2009, 51 patients were enrolled into the study. Compliance with chemotherapy was 80%. The incidence of G3 diarrhoea and proctitis were 17.6% and 21.5%, respectively. Surgery was performed in 48 patients with 100% R0 resection. 76.4% of low-lying tumours underwent conservative treatment. Seventy-nine percent of patients were downstaged: T and N downstaging were observed in 71% and 75% of patients, respectively. A pCR was obtained in 11 (22.9%) patients.

OBJECTIVE: The incidence of postflight orthostatic intolerance after short-duration spaceflight is about 20%. However, the incidence after long-duration spaceflight was unknown. The purpose of this study was to test the hypothesis that orthostatic intolerance is more severe after long-duration than after short-duration flight., METHODS: We performed tilt tests on six astronauts before and after long-duration (129-190 days) spaceflights and compared these data with data obtained during stand tests before and after previous short-duration missions., RESULTS: Five of the six astronauts studied became presyncopal during tilt testing after long-duration flights. Only one had become presyncopal during stand testing after short-duration flights. We also compared the long-duration flight tilt test data to tilt test data from 20 different astronauts who flew on the short-duration Shuttle missions that delivered and recovered the astronauts to and from the Mir Space Station.

Heart rate responses to tilt were no different between astronauts on long-duration flights and astronauts on short-duration flights, but long-duration subjects had lower stroke volumes and cardiac outputs than short-duration presyncopal subjects, suggesting a possible decrease in cardiac contractile function. One subject had subnormal norepinephrine release with upright posture after the long flight but not after the short flight. Plasma volume losses were not greater after long flights., CONCLUSION: Long-duration spaceflight markedly increases orthostatic intolerance, probably with multiple contributing factors.",Excluded
212,"Transgenerational effects of preconception paternal contamination with (55)Fe. The conjecture that germline mutations induced by radiation exposure before conception may predispose subsequent offspring to cancer remains contentious. Previous experimental studies have shown that preconception paternal irradiation with (239)Pu induces perturbations in the hemopoietic systems of offspring and influences sensitivity to a secondary carcinogen. In the present study, male DBA2 mice were injected intravenously with the Auger electron emitter (55)Fe (4 kBq g(-1)) 18 or 84 days before mating with normal females. Comet analysis showed an increased incidence of DNA strand breaks in sperm from contaminated animals after 84 days, but not after 18 days, indicating spermatogonial rather than spermatid damage. Offspring were either assayed for changes in bone marrow stem cells and committed progenitors or challenged with the chemical carcinogen methyl nitrosourea (MNU, 50 mg/kg) at 10 weeks of age and monitored for the onset of malignancy. Offspring from irradiated fathers had normal peripheral blood profiles, although the stem cell population was amplified in offspring arising from those exposed to (55)Fe at 84 days before conception. Exposure to MNU significantly increased the incidence of lympho-hemopoietic malignancies in offspring from the 84-day group, but not in those from the 18-day group. These findings support the hypothesis that aberrations that are potentially leukemogenic may be transmitted to offspring after radiation damage to the paternal germline.",Excluded
1843,"Sleep disturbances are related to decreased transmission of blue light to the retina caused by lens yellowing. STUDY OBJECTIVES: Sleep pattern and circadian rhythms are regulated via the retinohypothalamic tract in response to stimulation of a subset of retinal ganglion cells, predominantly by blue light (450-490 nm). With age, the transmission of blue light to the retina is reduced because of the aging process of the human lens, and this may impair the photoentrainment of circadian rhythm leading to sleep disorders. The aim of the study was to examine the association between lens aging and sleep disorders., DESIGN: Cross-sectional population based study., SETTING: The study was performed at the Research Center for Prevention and Health, Glostrup Hospital, Denmark and at the Department of Ophthalmology, Herlev Hospital, Denmark., PARTICIPANTS: An age- and sex-stratified sample of 970 persons aged 30 to 60 years of age drawn from a sample randomly selected from the background population., INTERVENTIONS: Not applicable., MEASUREMENTS AND RESULTS: Sleep disturbances were evaluated by a combination of questionnaire and the use of prescription sleeping medication. Lens aging (transmission and yellowing) was measured objectively by lens autofluorometry. The risk of sleep disturbances was significantly increased when the transmission of blue light to the retina was low, even after correction for the effect of age and other confounding factors such as smoking habits, diabetes mellitus, gender, and the risk of ischemic heart disease (P < 0.0001)., CONCLUSIONS: Filtration of blue light by the aging lens was significantly associated with an increased risk of sleep disturbances. We propose that this is a result of disturbance of photoentrainment of circadian rhythms.",Excluded
2280,"Experience with intensity-modulated radiotherapy in the treatment of head and neck cancer. Purpose; Studies using intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) in the treatment of head and neck tumors have shown to decrease acute and late radiation toxicity However, the high conformity of this technique can increase the risk of recurrence due to geographic miss. The aim of this study was to analyze whether the results of IMRT met the theoretical expectations concerning treatment efficacy. Method(s): From a total of 185 patients (152 males and 33 females, mean age 58+/-10.36 years) 176 were evaluable and were studied. Eighty-nine (48.1%) patients had surgica, treatment and 50 of them were scheduled for concomitant cisplatin chemotherapy. Irradiation was performed using IMRT, a sliding window with 9 fields in a Varian 2100 C/D linear accelerator, X-ray beam, 6 Me V. The prescribed dose in the planning treatment volume (PTV1), i.e., the area of the primary tumor and nodal area, was 66 Gy/2.2 Gy-7C Gy/2.12 Gy. In the PTV2 (the area at high risk) the dose was 60Gy/2 Gy-59.4 Gy/1.8 Gy, and in the PTV 3 (the area treated with prophylactic irradiation) the prescribed dose was 54 Gy/1.8 Gy-50.4 Gy/1.53 Gy. Result(s): The 3-year overall survival (OS) and relapse-free survival RFS of IMRT-treated patients, most of whom were in stages III and IV (158 out of 177), were 50 and 57%, respectively. Using postoperative radiotherapy/chemo-radiotherapy 3-year locoregioncal control was achieved in 75% of the cases as compared with 35% in non-operated patients. Conclusion(s): The worst outcomes were found in oral cavity and hypopharyngeal tumors, and the best in laryngeal and oropharyngeal tumors. Better results were found in surgically treated patients, and in lower disease stages. Despite the high conformity of dose distribution and efforts to spare healthy tissues, most cases of locoregional relapse occurred in areas receiving the full radiation dose.

3597,"New dose constraint reduces radiation-induced fatal pneumonitis in locally advanced non-small cell lung cancer patients treated with intensity-modulated radiotherapy. Background. Intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) in locally advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) allows treatment of patients with large tumour volumes, but radiation pneumonitis (RP) remains a dose limiting complication. The incidence of severe RP using three-dimensional (3D) conformal radiotherapy, was previously reported to be 17%, with 2% lethal RP. The aim of this study was to monitor the incidence of RP following the introduction of IMRT.Material and methods. IMRT was delivered using 4-8 beam arrangements and introduced in three phases. In phase I, 12 patients were treated using only one dose constraint (V20), in which the total lung volume receiving 20 Gy was limited to 40%. In phase II, 25 patients were treated with an additional dose constraint of mean lung dose (MLD) <= 20 Gy. In phase III, 50 patients were treated with an extra dose constraint (V5) in which the total lung volume receiving a dose of 5 Gy was <= 60%. RP was prospectively documented. The results of phase I & II (IMRT-1) were compared to those in phase III (IMRT-2).Results. The median follow-up time was 17 months. The introduction of IMRT was associated with an increase in the incidence of RP in Phase I&II (IMRT-1) to 41%, six of 37 (16%) had grade 5 RP (IMRT-1). Introducing the dose constraint V5, led to a significant reduction in the lung volume receiving doses <= 20 Gy from 51 +/- 2% to 41 +/- 1% (p < 0.0001). Introducing V5 constraint did not decrease the incidence of severe (grade >= 3) RP, but significantly decreased the lethal pneumonitis to 4% (two of 50 patients), p = 0.05.Conclusion. Introducing IMRT resulted in an increase in the incidence of severe and fatal RP, however a new dose constraint to the volume of lung receiving low doses reduced the incidence of lethal pneumonitis.Copyright © 2015 Informa Healthcare.",Excluded

626,"Radiotherapy for Pancreatic Neuroendocrine Tumors. Purpose: Pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (PNTs) are rare malignant neoplasms considered to be resistant to radiotherapy (RT), although data on efficacy are scarce. We reviewed our institutional experience to further delineate the role of RT for patients with PNTs. Methods and Materials: Between 1986 and 2006, 36 patients with PNTs were treated with RT to 49 sites. Of these 36 patients, 23 had radiographic follow-up data, which were used to determine the tumor response rate and freedom from local progression. Long-term toxicity was graded according to the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events. Result(s): The overall response rate to RT was 39% (13% complete response, 26% partial response, 56% stable disease, and 4% progressive disease). A significant difference in the freedom from local progression between the groups receiving either greater than or less than the median 2 Gy/fraction biologically equivalent dose of 49.6 Gy was found, with all radiographic progression occurring in patients who had received <=32 Gy. The actuarial 3-year local freedom from progression rate was 49%. Palliation was achieved in 90% of patients, with either improvement or resolution of symptoms after RT. Of 35 patients, 33 had metastatic disease at their referral for RT, and the median overall survival for this patient population was 2 years. Three long-term Grade 3 or greater toxicities were recorded. Conclusion(s): RT is an effective modality for achieving local control in patients with PNTs. RT produces high rates of symptomatic palliation and freedom from local progression. Prospective trials of radiotherapy for PNTs are warranted. © 2009 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.",Excluded
2516,"Benefits for bone from resistance exercise and nutrition in long-duration spaceflight: Evidence from biochemistry and densitometry. Exercise has shown little success in mitigating bone loss from long-duration spaceflight. The first crews of the International Space Station (ISS) used the ""interim resistive exercise device"" (iRED), which allowed loads of up to 297 lb(f) (or 1337 N) but provided little protection of bone or no greater protection than aerobic exercise. In 2008, the Advanced Resistive Exercise Device (ARED), which allowed absolute loads of up to 600 lb(f) (1675 N), was launched to the ISS. We report dietary intake, bone densitometry, and biochemical markers in 13 crewmembers on ISS missions from 2006 to 2009. Of these 13, 8 had access to the iRED and 5 had access to the ARED. In both groups, bone-specific alkaline phosphatase tended to increase during flight toward the end of the mission (p = 0.06) and increased 30 days after landing (p < 0.001). Most markers of bone resorption were also increased in both groups during flight and 30 days after landing (p < 0.05). Bone densitometry revealed significant interactions (time and exercise device) for pelvis bone mineral density (BMD) and bone mineral content (p < 0.01), hip femoral neck BMD (p < 0.05), trochanter BMD (p < 0.05), and total hip BMD (p < 0.05). These variables were unchanged from preflight only for ARED crewmembers, who also returned from flight with higher percent lean mass and lower percent fat mass. Body mass was unchanged after flight in both groups. All crewmembers had nominal vitamin D status (75 +/- 17 nmol/L) before and during flight. These data document that resistance exercise, coupled with adequate energy intake (shown by maintenance of body mass determined by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry [DXA]) and vitamin D, can maintain bone in most regions during 4- to 6-month missions in microgravity. This is the first evidence that improving nutrition and resistance exercise during spaceflight can attenuate the expected BMD deficits previously observed after prolonged missions.

2142,"Facilitation of somatic calcium channels can evoke prolonged tail currents in rat hypoglossal motoneurons. Voltage-dependent persistent inward currents (PICs) make an important contribution to the input-output properties of alpha motoneurons. PICs are thought to be mediated by membrane channels located primarily on the dendrites as evidenced by prolonged tail currents following the termination of a voltage step and by a clockwise hysteresis in the whole cell inward currents recorded in response to depolarizing then repolarizing voltage ramp commands. We report here, however, that voltage-clamp currents with these same features can be generated in isolated somatic membrane patches from rat hypoglossal motoneurons. Long-lasting (200-800 ms) tail currents after 1-s voltage-clamp pulses were observed in nucleated patches from 16 of 23 cells. Further, these somatic PICs display ""facilitation"" in response to conditioning depolarization as previously observed in whole cell recordings from intact neurons. Pharmacological tests suggest that the PICs were primarily mediated by Cav1 channels. Our results show that many of the features of persistent calcium currents recorded from intact motoneurons do not necessarily reflect a remote dendritic origin but can also be ascribed to the intrinsic properties of their Cav1 channels.",Excluded

All patients were diagnosed by MRI before procedure. They were confirmed by postoperative histopathology or further verification by MRI. The irradiation dose of Gamma knife around tumors were 11-16 Gy (mean 14.3 +/-1.1 Gy), covered by 45%-50% isodose line and ensured that the exposure dose of the optic cross was less than 8 Gy. In the first year after operation, they were followed up at 3, 6, 9, and 12 months, and after that, the clinical efficacy, surgical complications and tumor volume were evaluated once a year. Result(s): Thirty-five patients were followed up for 12-77 months (mean 36 +/-4months). No surgery-related optic nerve injury and new cranial nerve injury occurred in all cases. Symptomatic patients were 28 (80%) and symptomatic improvement rate was 96. 4% (n = 27), among them, the symptoms were improved in 15 cases (53. 6%), and the symptoms disappeared in 12 cases (42. 9%), did not have any change in 1 (3. 6%) case, and no symptom deterioration occurred. The symptom improvement time was 2-7 months after surgery (mean 3.7 +/-0.3 months). Imaging follow-up revealed that in 35patients with cavernous sinus cavernous hemangioma treated by gamma knife radiosurgery, the tumor volume was significantly reduced after treatment compared with that before treatment, and the difference was statistically significant (8.8 +/-0.9 cm3 vs. 32. 6 +/-3. 6 cm3, t = 8. 492, P < 0. 01).

Purpose: Management of synchronous early-stage non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) remains controversial because resection is not always feasible. This study evaluates efficacy and patterns of failure after SABR for synchronous early-stage NSCLC. Methods and Materials: From 2005 to 2015, patients presenting with >=2 synchronous NSCLC tumors (T1a-T2b) and receiving SABR to >=1 lesion were reviewed. The most common prescriptions were 50 Gy in 4 or 70 Gy in 10 fractions. Patients underwent multidisciplinary management with workup including chest computed tomography and positron emission tomography/computed tomography, plus brain imaging and endoscopic bronchial ultrasound for most patients to rule out mediastinal and distant disease. Synchronous lesions were defined as multiple ipsilateral or contralateral intrapulmonary lesions diagnosed within 6 months. Result(s): Of 912 patients treated with SABR for early-stage NSCLC at our institution, 82 (9%) presented with synchronous disease, with a total of 169 lesions. SABR was delivered to 142 lesions (84%), with 57 patients (69.5%) receiving SABR for all sites. Median overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) were 5.1 and 2.7 years, respectively. At a median follow-up of 58 months, OS was 67% and 52% at 3 and 5 years, and corresponding PFS was 47% and 29%. Thirty-nine patients (48%) had progression, with 21 (26%) experiencing distant failure, and intralobar recurrence was among the first failure for 15 patients (18%). Of the 142 SABR-treated sites, these included 6 in-field (4%) and 4 marginal (3%) recurrences. There were no grade >=3 adverse events. Among patients receiving SABR for all sites, there were no differences in OS (P = .946), PFS (P = .980), local control (P = .683), regional and distant control (P = .656), or toxicity (P = .791). On multivariable analysis, ipsilateral synchronous disease was associated with greater regional and distant failure (hazard ratio, 2.691; P = .025). Conclusion(s): Synchronous NSCLC can be managed with definitive local therapy. With high control rates and favorable outcomes, SABR is an effective and feasible treatment for synchronous early-stage NSCLC.Copyright © 2020 Elsevier Inc.",Excluded

Measurements of erythemally weighted UVR are usually related to days of exposure and to the anatomical distribution of UVR on the human body. The aim of this research is to describe the UVR exposure of workers during a strawberry production cycle in order to assess the UVR hazard and to identify the highest exposure in the anatomical distribution of UVR on the body during an entire agricultural production cycle. This research was carried out on the experimental farm (Azienda Agraria Didattico- Sperimentale) of Universita Politecnica delle Marche in Agugliano, Italy. A spectrometer was used to measure UVR, and electronic dosimeters were used to record UVR exposure. The measurements were carried out on all working days of the strawberry production cycle in 2012 during daily peak UVR levels. The daily UVR exposure geometric mean and the percentage ambient UVR in the strawberry production cycle were calculated and analyzed to assess the hazard for workers during the entire production cycle. The nape of the neck was the anatomical site most exposed to UVR. The mean daily UVR exposure on the nape of the neck was higher than 1.50 SED, the minimum value required to produce perceptible erythema in unacclimatized white skin, and a maximum value of 2.29 SED was measured. Real-time exposure data suggest that it may be useful to remind workers of the risks associated with UVR exposure. © 2014 ASABE ISSN 1074-7583.",Excluded

116,"New recommendation and coverage of low-dose computed tomography for lung cancer screening: uptake has increased but is still low. BACKGROUND: In 2013, the US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) issued recommendations for low-dose computed tomography for lung cancer screening (LDCT-LCS), but there continues to be a dearth of information on the adoption of LDCT-LCS in healthcare systems. Using a multilevel perspective, our study aims to assess referrals for LDCT-LCS and identify facilitators and barriers to adoption following recent policy changes. METHOD(S): A retrospective analysis of electronic medical record data from patients aged 55-80 years with no history of lung cancer who visited a primary care provider in a large healthcare system in California during 2010-2016 (1,572,538 patient years). Trends in documentation of smoking history, number of eligible patients, and lung cancer screening orders were assessed. Using Hierarchical Generalized Linear Models, we also evaluated provider-level and patient-level factors associated with lung cancer screening orders among 970 primary care providers and 12,801 eligible patients according to USPSTF guidelines between January 1st, 2014 and December 31st, 2016. RESULT(S): Documentation of smoking history to determine eligibility (59.2% in 2010 to 77.8% in 2016) and LDCT-LCS orders (0% in 2010 to 7.3% in 2016) have increased since USPSTF guidelines. Patient factors associated with increased likelihood of lung cancer screening orders include: younger patient age (78-80 vs. 55-64 years old: OR, 0.4; 95% CI, 0.3-0.7), Asian race (vs. Non-Hispanic White: OR, 1.6; 95% CI, 1.1-2.4), reported current smoking (vs. former smoker: OR, 1.7; 95% CI, 1.4-2.0), no severe comorbidity (severe vs. no major comorbidity: OR=0.2, 95% CI=0.1-0.3; moderate vs. no major comorbidity: OR=0.5; 95% CI=0.4-0.7), and making a visit to own primary care provider (vs. other primary care providers: OR, 2.4; 95% CI, 1.7-3.4). Appropriate referral for lung cancer screening varies considerably across primary care providers. Provider factors include being a female physician (vs. male: OR, 1.6; 95% CI, 1.1-2.3) and receiving medical training in the US (foreign vs. US medical school graduates: OR=0.4, 95% CI=0.3-0.7).

Purpose/Objective(s): Palliative radiation therapy (RT) is a wellestablished treatment option for symptomatic bone metastases, with few treatment-related side effects. However, pain flare, a temporary worsening of bone pain in the irradiated metastatic site, has been recognized following RT. The aim of this study is to determine the incidence of pain flare following RT for painful bone metastases. Materials/Methods: Patients with bone metastases treated with RT were eligible. Worst pain scores and analgesic consumption were collected before, daily during, and for 10 days after treatment. Pain flare was defined as a 2-point increase in the worst pain score (0-10) compared to baseline with no decrease in analgesic intake, or a 25% increase in analgesic intake with no decrease in worst pain score. The Brief Pain Inventory (BPI) was administered to measure the ""sensory"" dimension of pain (intensity, or severity) and its ""reactive"" dimension (interference with daily function) before the RT treatment and at the 4-weeks follow-up evaluation. Descriptive statistics were reported. Response rate and 95% confidence intervals were calculated at 4 weeks after RT. A comparison of patients with pain flare vs those without was performed. The relationships between the occurrence of pain flare and collected demographic variables were investigated. Result(s): From June 2010 to December 2013, 160 patients were enrolled in this study. From this cohort, 94 patients with complete data were evaluable for pain flare. There were 61 (65%) men and 33 (35%) women. Median age was 66 years. The majority of patients had primary breast (12%), lung (31%), or prostate (22%) carcinoma and were treated with 8 Gy in a single fraction (28%) or 20 Gy in five fractions (65%). The overall pain flare incidence across all centers was 42/94 (44.7%). The majority of pain flares occurred on Days 1-5 (88%) as opposed to Days 6-10 (12%). The median duration of the pain flare was 2 days. There was no significant difference between patients who experienced a pain flare vs those who did not in terms of sex, age, primary cancer site, radiation dose, previous systemic therapy, location or area of RT, or on any of the BPI items (p > 0.05). BPI scores showed a significant improvement at 4 weeks on all functional interference items (p < 0.05). The main differences were seen in the ""worst pain"" and ""sleep"" domains, both decreased from 7/10 at baseline to 4/10 at the 4-week follow-up.

Purpose: To evaluate the relationship between radiation doses and lung computed tomographic (CT) fluoroscopic scan parameters and to determine optimal scan parameters for performance of lung interventional radiologic (IR) procedures. Material(s) and Method(s): The institutional review board approved this prospective study, which included 32 patients with a single lung tumor;written informed consent was obtained. CT fluoroscopic images were obtained with three tube voltages (80,120,135 kV) and three tube currents (10, 20, 30 mA) in each patient. The signal-to-noise ratios(SNRs) and the contrast-to-noise ratios (CNRs) were measured quantitatively. To evaluate the feasibility of performing lung IR procedures, four readers visually scored the image quality. Acceptable CT fluoroscopic images were determined by using agreement of at least three of the four readers. The weighted CT dose index for each CT scan parameter was measured. A piecewise linear regression equation was obtained from the relationship between radiation doses and visual image scores. Result(s): Both the SNR and the CNR improved as the radiation dose increased, leading to improvement in the image quality. Acceptable image quality was achieved in 94% (30 of 32) of patients when the radiation dose was 1.18 mGy/sec (120 kV, 10 mA) and in all patients when it was greater than 1.48 mGy/sec (135 kV, 10 mA). The piecewise linear curve showed rapid improvement in image quality until the radiation dose increased to 1.48 mGy/sec (135 kV, 10 mA). When the radiation dose was increased greater than 1.48 mGy/sec, improvement in the image quality became more gradual. Conclusion(s): Results of this study can be used to guide the determination of optimal scan parameters in lung CT fluoroscopy. © RSNA, 2010.",Excluded

OBJECTIVE: Our objective was to show that a chest X-ray (CXR) and an abdominal computed tomography (CT) scan are sufficient to identify most clinically significant thoracic injuries in trauma patients, rendering the thoracic CT scan useful in only a subset of patients., METHODS: A retrospective study identified thoracic injuries in 374 trauma patients evaluated with a CXR, a thoracic CT scan, and an abdominal CT scan. Injuries seen on the initial CXR versus those seen on a CT scan only (occult) were identified and assessed for clinical relevance., RESULTS: An abdominal CT scan identified 65% (15/23) of occult pneumothoraces, 100% (25/25) of occult hemothoraces, 64% (18/28) of occult pulmonary contusions, and 58% (18/31) of occult rib fractures. No occult pneumothoraces seen on the thoracic CT scan alone required tube thoracostomy., CONCLUSIONS: Our pilot study suggests that a CXR and an abdominal CT scan will identify most occult intrathoracic injuries. Reserving a thoracic CT scan for patients with an abnormal CXR or high-risk mechanism could safely reduce cost and radiation exposure while still diagnosing significant thoracic injuries.

Aim Many publications in recent decades have reported a temporal link between medical events and environmental physical activity. The aim of this study was to analyze the time of occurrence of electrical heart storms against levels of cosmological parameters. Methods The sample included 82 patients (71 male) with ischemic cardiomyopathy treated with an implantable cardioverter defibrillator at a tertiary medical center in 1999-2012 (5,114 days). The time of occurrence of all electrical heart storms, defined as three or more events of ventricular tachycardia or ventricular fibrillation daily, was recorded from the defibrillator devices. Findings were analyzed against data on solar, geomagnetic, and cosmic ray (neutron) activity for the same time period obtained from space institutions in the United States and Russia. Results Electrical storms occurred in all months of the year, with a slight decrease in July, August, and September. Most events took place on days with lower-than-average levels of solar and geomagnetic activity and higher-than-average levels of cosmic ray (neutron) activity. There was a significant difference in mean daily cosmic ray activity between the whole observation period and the days of electrical storm activity (P = 0.0001). Conclusion These data extend earlier findings on the association of the timing of cardiac events and space weather parameters to the most dangerous form of cardiac arrhythmia-electric storms.

240,"Post-treatment skin reactions reported by cancer patients differ by race, not by treatment or expectations. Cancer patients may experience skin problems while undergoing chemotherapy and radiation therapy. Frequency of skin reactions may be influenced by skin pigmentation and psychological factors. A Symptom Inventory completed by 656 cancer patients nationwide before and after chemotherapy, radiation therapy, or chemotherapy plus radiation therapy was analysed to determine if treatment type, race (Black vs White), and pretreatment expectations influenced post-treatment skin reactions. Subsequent analysis of a local Symptom Inventory completed weekly for 5 weeks by 308 patients receiving radiation therapy examined severity of reported skin reactions. Significantly more patients receiving radiation therapy had stronger expectations of skin problems (62%) than patients receiving chemotherapy (40%, P=0.001) or chemotherapy plus radiation therapy (45%, P=0.003). Overall, expectations did not correlate with patient reported post-treatment skin problems in white (r=0.014, P=0.781) or black (r=0.021, P=0.936) patients. Although no significant difference was found between black and white patients in their pretreatment expectations of skin problems (P=0.32), black patients (10 out of 18, 56%) reported more skin problems than white patients (90 out of 393, 23%, P=0.001). Similarly, the local study showed that significantly more black patients (1 out of 5, 20%) reported severe skin reactions at the treatment site than white patients (12 out of 161, 8%). A direct correlation was observed between severity of skin problems and pain at the treatment site (r=0.541, P<0.001). Total radiation exposure did not significantly correlate with the report of skin problems at the treatment site for white or black patients. Overall, black patients reported more severe post-treatment skin problems than white patients. Our results suggest that symptom management for post-treatment skin reactions in cancer patients receiving radiation treatment could differ depending on their racial background.",Excluded
629,"Regional radiation dose susceptibility within the parotid gland: Effects on salivary loss and recovery. Purpose: Xerostomia is one of the most likely late toxic effects of radiotherapy treatment in patients with head-and-neck cancers. Modern treatment techniques can incorporate knowledge of complication risk into treatment plans. To this end, the authors attempt to quantify the regional radiotherapy dose-dependence of salivary output loss and recovery in a prospective study. Method(s): Salivary output was collected from patients undergoing radiotherapy treatment for headand- neck cancers at the BC Cancer Agency between February 2008 and May 2013. Regional dose-dependence (i.e., dose susceptibility) of loss and recovery is quantified using nonparametric (Spearmans rank correlation coefficients, local linear regression) and parametric (least-sum of squares, least-median of squares) techniques. Result(s): Salivary flow recovery was seen in 79 of 102 patients considered (p < 0.0001, Wilcoxon sign rank test). Output loss was strongly correlated with left- and right parotid combined dose phi = min (DL, 45 Gy)+min (DR, 45 Gy), and can be accurately predicted. Median early loss (three months) was 72% of baseline, while median overall loss (1 yr) was 56% of baseline. Fitting an exponential model to whole parotid yields dose sensitivities A3m = 0.0604 Gy?1 and A1y = 0.0379 Gy?1. Recovery was not significantly associated with dose. Hints of lateral organ subsegment doseresponse dimorphism were observed. Conclusion(s): Sub-segmentation appears to predict neither loss nor recovery with any greater precision than whole parotid mean dose, though it is not any worse. Sparing the parotid to a combined dose phi of <50 Gy is recommended for a patient to keep =40% of baseline function and thus avoid severe xerostomia at 12 months post-treatment. It seems unlikely that a populations mean recovery will exceed 20%30% of baseline output at 1 yr after radiotherapy treatment using current (whole-organ based) clinical guidelines.Copyright © 2015 Am.

3392,"Usefulness of doppler techniques in the diagnosis of peripheral iatrogenic pseudoaneurysms secondary to minimally invasive interventional and surgical procedures: imaging findings and diagnostic performance study. The pseudoaneurysm (PA) is a perfused sac directly connecting with the arterial lumen by an interruption of the vessel wall continuity, more commonly secondary to trauma or iatrogenic causes. Aim of our study was to determine the accuracy and usefulness of Doppler techniques in the diagnosis of peripheral iatrogenic PAs secondary to minimally invasive procedures. From a three year prospective research, 20 Duplex Ultrasound (DUS) studies in as many patients presenting with periarterial pulsating mass clinically suspected for PA secondary to minimally invasive procedures were selected. The PA final diagnosis was confirmed by angiography in 12 patients (60% cases), by computed tomography angiography in 5 patients (25%), by surgery in 2 patients (10%), and by magnetic resonance angiography in 1 patient (5%). The vessels involved by PA formation were: common femoral artery in 8 cases (40%); superficial femoral artery in 4 cases (20%); brachial artery in 3 cases (15%); popliteal artery in 2 cases (10%); superficial temporal artery (STA) in 2 cases (10%); dorsal medial digital artery of the foot in 1 case (5%). Our study confirmed the usefulness of doppler techniques in the diagnosis of peripheral iatrogenic PAs. Specifically, a sensitivity of 90-95%, a specificity of 100% and predictive values of 100% (VPP) and 83-90% (VPN) were reported. The radiologist must always suspect a PA in the differential diagnosis of lesions contiguous to an artery vessel. This is to prevent potential complications such as e.g. massive haemorrhage. In this order, DUS allows a careful selection of patients who require to undergo in-depth imaging methods or surgical therapy, thus contributing to a significant reduction of contrast medium and exposure to ionizing radiation.Copyright © 2020, Societa Italiana di Ultrasonologia in Medicina e Biologia (SIUMB).",Excluded
2422,"[Prospective double-blind study of prophylaxis of radioxerostomia with Coumarin/Troxerutine in patients with head and neck cancer]. AIM: Prospective, randomized placebo-controlled double-blind study to prove the efficacy of Coumarin/Troxerutine (Venalot Depot) for protection of salivary glands during a head and neck irradiation., PATIENTS AND METHOD: Forty-eight radiotherapy patients (60 Gy) with head and neck cancer were included in this trial. During radiotherapy the salivary glands were located in the core irradiation field. Primary efficacy parameters were sialometry, quantitative salivary gland scintigraphy and clinical evaluation of early effects of radiotherapy (RTOG-score, Table 1). All data were collected at 6 assessments: 1 week pre-radiation (U1), at start (U2), half time (U3) and end (U4) of irradiation, 8 days (U5) and 28 days (U6) after the end of irradiation (Figure 1)., RESULTS: Twenty-three patients (11 verum, 12 placebo) completed the study with all assessments. Sialometrically, all patients were severely (half of radiotherapy) or completely (end of radiotherapy) xerostomatic (Figure 2). In a global efficacy measure according to O'Brien combining scintigraphy and RTOG there was a tendency for a higher efficacy of verum compared to placebo (p = 0.068). After start of irradiation therapy, the RTOG-score showed continuously and significantly lower early radiation effects under verum than under placebo (U3 vs U6: p < 0.05, area under curve: p = 0.032; Table 2, Figure 3). The scintigraphically determined excretion fraction was slightly less impaired in the verum group compared to the placebo treatment (p = 0.12. Figure 4). There was no difference in drug safety between placebo and verum for adverse events, changes in the activity of liver enzymes and for global impression of tolerability., CONCLUSIONS: The results give support for an advantageous effect of Venalot Depot in the treatment of radiogenic sialadenitis and mucositis. In even a small number of evaluable patients, early clinical effects of irradiation (RTOG-score) were less pronounced in the active treatment group than in the placebo group, but the sample size was too low to prove statistically also the benefit of coumarin/troxerutine with the scintigraphic method. Sialometry seems not suitable for the assessment of early radiation effects.",Excluded
242,"Hypervascular liver tumors: low tube voltage, high tube current multidetector CT during late hepatic arterial phase for detection--initial clinical experience. PURPOSE: To intraindividually compare a low tube voltage (80 kVp), high tube current computed tomographic (CT) technique with a standard CT protocol (140 kVp) in terms of image quality, radiation dose, and detection of malignant hypervascular liver tumors during the late hepatic arterial phase., MATERIALS AND METHODS: This prospective single-center HIPAA-compliant study had institutional review board approval, and written informed consent was obtained. Forty-eight patients (31 men, 17 women; age range, 35-77 years) with 60 malignant hypervascular liver tumors (mean diameter, 20.1 mm +/- 16.4 [standard deviation]) were enrolled. Pathologic proof of focal lesions was obtained with histopathologic analysis for 33 nodules and imaging follow-up after a minimum of 12 months for 27 nodules. Patients underwent dual-energy 64-section multi-detector row CT. By using vendor-specific software, two imaging protocols-140 kVp and 385 mA (protocol A) and 80 kVp and 675 mA (protocol B)-were compared during the late hepatic arterial phase of contrast enhancement. Paired t tests were used to compare tumor-to-liver contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR) for each lesion, mean image noise, and effective dose between the two data sets. Three readers qualitatively assessed the two data sets in a blinded and independent fashion. Lesion detection and characterization and reader confidence were recorded, as well as readers' subjective evaluations of image quality. Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney statistical analysis was performed on this assessment., RESULTS: Image noise increased from 5.7 to 11.4 HU as the tube voltage decreased from 140 to 80 kVp (P < .0001), resulting in a significantly lower image quality score (4.0 vs 3.0, respectively) with protocol B according to all readers (P < .001). At the same time, protocol B yielded significantly higher CNR (8.2 vs 6.4) and lesion conspicuity scores (4.6 vs 4.1) than protocol A, along with a lower effective dose (5.1 vs 17.5 mSv) (P < .001 for all)., CONCLUSION: By substantially increasing the tumor-to-liver CNR, a low tube voltage, high tube current CT technique improves the conspicuity of malignant hypervascular liver tumors during the late hepatic arterial phase while significantly reducing patient radiation dose.",Excluded
732,"Safety and efficacy of thoracic external beam radiotherapy after airway stenting in malignant airway obstruction. Purpose: We retrospectively evaluated the outcome and toxicity of external beam radiotherapy (EBRT) after airway stents were placed in patients treated for malignant airway obstruction. Methods and Materials: Between 2004 and 2009, we performed airway stenting followed by EBRT in 43 patients for symptomatic primary lung cancer (n = 31) or other thoracic malignancies (n = 12). The median time interval between stent placement and first irradiation was 14 days. A median total dose of 50 Gy was delivered. Sixty-seven percent of the patients had reduced performance status (Karnofsky performance score, <=70). Result(s): EBRT had to be stopped prematurely in 16 patients (37%), at a median total dose of 17 Gy, for various reasons. In this group of patients, the survival was poor, with a median overall survival (OS) of only 21 days. Twenty-seven patients (63%) completed radiotherapy as planned, with a median OS of 8.4 months. Fourteen of 43 patients (33%) developed at least one Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Event of grade 3 to 5. The most common event was a malignant restenosis of the stent leading to asphyxia (n = 7), followed by fistula formation (n = 4), necrosis (n = 3), mediastinitis with abscess (n = 1), secondary nonmalignant airway stenosis (n = 1), and hemoptysis (n = 1). With the exception of one event, all events were associated with a local progression of the tumor. Conclusion(s): Although the long-term prognosis for patients with malignant airway obstruction is poor, airway stenting combined with EBRT offers a possible therapeutic option, achieving fast relief of acute respiratory distress with an associated antitumor effect, resulting in a potential survival benefit. However, due to local advanced tumor growth, increased rates of adverse events are to be expected, necessitating careful monitoring. © 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.",Excluded
118,"Effects of whole-body UVB irradiation on cytokine production by peripheral blood mononuclear cells from stage I melanoma patients. Ultraviolet (UV) radiation causes significant impairment of immunological function in human skin. The immunosuppressive effects of UV radiation are thought to be due to local release of cytokines by human keratinocytes, leading to impaired function of epidermal antigen-presenting cells (APC) and failure to induce cutaneous delayed-type hypersensitivity (DTH) reactions. Recent studies have shown that individuals susceptible to UV-induced suppression of DTH may be more prone to develop skin cancer including malignant melanoma (MM). Since the causal relationship between UV radiation and the induction of MM still seems obscure, we investigated the immunological reactions of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) to whole-body irradiation with UVB in 15 stage I melanoma patients as compared to PBMC from normal volunteers matched for age, gender and skin type. Whole-body irradiation was performed with 0.8 minimal erythema dosages on five consecutive days. Peripheral blood was obtained before and after the procedure. Overall, there were no major effects of UVB irradiation on peripheral lymphocyte subsets and proliferation of PBMC from patients or normal controls, but UVB irradiation led to a significant increase in PWM-stimulated production of IL-6, IL-2R and TNF by PBMC. These changes were independent of the individual UVB dosages administered and appeared in both groups similarly. UVB irradiation did not lead to significant changes on IL-1 and IL-2 expression by PBMC. Our results suggest that PBMC participate in the cytokine response to UV, even in the absence of inflammatory reactions, but that this participation is not specific to MM patients.",Excluded

Aims: We present retrospective analysis of patients of glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) and discuss clinical characteristics, various treatment protocols, survival outcomes, and prognostic factors influencing survival. Material(s) and Method(s): From January 2002 to June 2009, 439 patients of GBM were registered in our department. The median age of patients was 50 years, 66.1% were males, and 75% underwent complete or near-total excision. We evaluated those 360 patients who received radiotherapy (RT). Radiotherapy schedule was selected depending upon pre-RT Karnofsky Performance Status (KPS). Patients with KPS < 70 (Group I, n = 48) were planned for RT dose of 30-35 Gy in 10-15 fractions, and patients with KPS >= 70 (Group II, n = 312) were planned for 60 Gy in 30 fractions. In group I, six patients and in group II, 89 patients received some form of chemotherapy (lomustine or temozolomide). Statistical Analysis Used: Statistical analysis was done using Statistical Package for Social Sciences, version 12.0. Overall survival (OS) was calculated using Kaplan-Meier method, and prognostic factors were determined by log rank test. The Cox proportional hazards model was used for multivariate analysis. Result(s): The median follow-up was 7.53 months. The median and 2-year survival rates were 6.33 months and 2.24% for group I and 7.97 months and 8.21% for group II patients, respectively ( P = 0.001). In multivariate analysis, site of tumor (central vs. others; P = 0.006), location of tumor (parietal lobe vs. others; P = 0.003), RT dose (<60 Gy vs. 60 Gy; P = 0.0001), and use of some form of chemotherapy ( P = 0.0001) were independent prognostic factors for survival. Conclusion(s): In patients with GBM, OS and prognosis remains dismal. Whenever possible, we should use concurrent and/or adjuvant chemotherapy to maximize the benefits of post-operative radiotherapy. Patients with poor performance status may be considered for hypofractionated RT schedules, which have similar median survival rates as conventional RT.",Excluded
1248,"Neo-adjuvant chemotherapy with cisplatin and short infusional 5-FU in advanced head and neck malignancies. Background: Combination of radical surgery and radiotherapy is the standard management of head and neck malignancies. But due to considerable morbidity of surgery and associated cosmetic and functional deficiencies, often aggravated by adjuvant radiotherapy, many patients prefer only radiotherapy with its' decreased chance of survival. Proper surgical facilities are also not accessible to most of our patients. Neo-adjuvant chemotherapy and loco-regional management by surgery and / or radiotherapy have emerged as a viable alternative. Aim(s): The purpose of this study is to find out the survival outcome as well as toxicity profile of Neo-adjuvant chemotherapy with cisplatin and short infusional (3 hours) 5-FU followed by radiotherapy in advanced head and neck malignancies. Material(s) and Method(s): From June 2002 to December 2003, seventy four patients with advanced head and neck malignancies were planned to be treated with Cisplatin (50 mg / sq. meter) on Days 1 and 2 and 5 - FU (600 mg / sq. meter) on Days 1, 2 and 3 by 3 hour infusion on Day care basis. On completion of four cycles of chemotherapy at 21 days interval, all patients were destined to receive 6000 cGy of radiotherapy to the loco - regional site. Result(s): At one year follow up on completion of therapy, 57% patients were alive and 31% patients were disease free. These 31% patients enjoyed a good quality of life in terms of cosmetic and functional deficits. Toxicities were moderate and easily manageable. Conclusion(s): The study indicated that neo-adjuvant chemotherapy with Cisplatin and short infusional 5 - FU may be delivered on day care basis and results are comparable with Cisplatin and 96 hours continuous infusional 5 - FU. Thus avoiding the continuous infusional 5 - FU, 7 to 10 days in-patient hospitalization during each cycle may be avoided which is a constrain in developing countries like us.",Excluded
2866,"EUS-guided portal pressure gradient measurement with a simple novel device: a human pilot study. Background and Aims Portal hypertension (PH) is a serious adverse event of liver cirrhosis. The hepatic venous pressure gradient or portal pressure gradient (PPG) accurately reflects the degree of PH and is the single best prognostic indicator in liver disease. This is usually obtained by interventional radiology (IR), although it is not routinely performed. Recently, we developed a simple novel technique for EUS-guided PPG measurement (PPGM). Our animal studies showed excellent correlation between EUS-PPGM and IR-PPGM. We present the first human pilot study of EUS-PPGM in patients with liver disease. Methods EUS-PPGM was performed by experienced endosonographers using a linear echoendoscope, a 25-gauge fine-needle aspiration needle, and a novel compact manometer. The portal vein and hepatic vein (or inferior vena cava) were targeted using a transgastric-transduodenal approach. Clinical parameters of PH were evaluated in each patient. Feasibility was defined as successful PPGM in each patient. Safety was based on adverse events captured in a postprocedural interview. Results Twenty-eight patients underwent EUS-PPGM with 100% technical success and no adverse events. PPG ranged from 1.5 to 19 mm Hg and had excellent correlation with clinical parameters of portal hypertension including the presence of varices (P = .0002), PH gastropathy (P = .007), and thrombocytopenia (P = .036). PPG was increased in patients with high clinical evidence of cirrhosis (P = .005). Conclusion This novel technique of EUS-PPGM using a 25-gauge needle and compact manometer is feasible and appears safe. Given the availability of EUS and the simplicity of the manometry setup, EUS-guided PPG may represent a promising breakthrough for procuring indispensable information in the management of patients with liver disease.Copyright © 2017",Excluded

The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of risedronate (RIS) on bone loss and bone turnover markers after liver transplantation (LT). Patients with osteopenia or osteoporosis within the first month after LT were randomized to receive RIS 35 mg/week plus calcium 1000 mg/day and vitamin D3 800 IU/day (n = 45) or calcium and vitamin D3 at same dosages (n = 44). Primary endpoint was change in bone mineral density (BMD) 6 and 12 months after LT. Secondary endpoints included changes in serum beta-CrossLaps (beta-CTX) and procollagen type 1 amino-terminal peptide (P1NP) and fracture rate. Spine X-rays were obtained at baseline and after 12 months. There was no significant difference in BMD changes between both treatment groups at any sites; either at 6 or 12 months. Spine BMD increased in both groups at 12 months vs. baseline (P = 0.001). RIS patients had a significant increase in intertrochanteric BMD at 12 months (P < 0.05 vs. baseline). Serum beta-CTX decreased in both groups (P < 0.01), with significant differences between groups at 3 months. No significant difference in vertebral fracture incidence was found. After 12 months, BMD improved at lumbar spine and did not change at hip in both groups. Significant differences between both groups were not found. Other factors (calcium and vitamin D replacement, early prednisone withdrawal) seem to have also positive effects in BMD. © 2011 The Authors Transplant International © 2011 European Society for Organ Transplantation.",Excluded
2122,"Cumulative radiation dose from medical imaging procedures in patients undergoing resection for lung cancer. Background: Radiation dose from diagnostic imaging procedures is not monitored in patients undergoing surgery for lung cancer. Evidence suggests an increased lifetime risk of malignancy of 1.0% per 100 millisieverts (mSv). As such, recommendations are to restrict healthcare and radiation workers to a maximum dose of 50 mSv per year or to 100 mSv over a three-year period. The purpose of this study was to estimate cumulative effective doses of radiation in patients undergoing lung cancer resection and to determine predictors of increased exposure. Method(s): We identified 94 consecutive patients undergoing resection for non-small cell lung cancer. Radiologic procedures performed from one year prior to resection until two years postresection were recorded. Estimates of effective doses (mSv) were obtained from published literature and institutional records. Predictors of dose greater than 50 mSv per year and greater than 100 mSv per three years were examined statistically. Result(s): The majority of patients (median age = 67 years) had stage IA cancer (52%). In the three-year period, patients had 1,958 radiologic studies (20.8/patient) including 398 computed tomographic (CT) scans (4.23/patient) and 211 positron emission tomography (PET) scans (2.24 per patient). The three-year median estimated radiation dose was 84.0 mSv (interquartile range, 44.1 to 123.2 mSv). The highest dose was in the preoperative year. In any one year, 66% of patients received more than 50 mSv, while 19% received over 100 mSv. Over the three-year period, 43.6% of patients exceeded 100 mSv. The majority of the radiation (89.8%) was from CT or PET scans. On multivariate analysis, a history of previous malignancy (odds ratio [OR] 3.8; confidence interval [CI] 1.14 to 12.7), postoperative complications (OR 6.16; CI 1.42 to 26.6), and postoperative surveillance with PET-CT (OR 13.2; CI 4.34 to 40.3) predicted exposure greater than 100 mSv over the three-year period. Conclusion(s): This study demonstrates that lung cancer patients often receive a higher dose of radiation than that considered safe for healthcare and radiation workers. The median cumulative dose reported in this study could potentially increase the individual estimated lifetime cancer risk by as much as 0.8%. Although risk-benefit considerations are clearly different between these groups, strategies should be in place to decrease radiation doses during the preoperative workup and postoperative period. © 2011 The Society of Thoracic Surgeons.",Excluded

The risk factors for squamous cell carcinoma, which belongs to the family of nonmelanoma skin cancers, have not been studied in Colombia., OBJECTIVE: To determine the risk factors for squamous cell carcinoma in patients at a national referral center for skin diseases in Colombia., MATERIAL AND METHODS: We conducted a case-control study that evaluated sociodemographic, epidemiological, and clinical factors among 332 individuals. Risk was calculated as odds ratio (ORs) using the multivariate conditional logistic regression analysis method., RESULTS: The following risk factors were identified: family history of skin cancer (OR, 6.55; 95% CI, 1.4-28.9), living in a rural area after the age of 30 years (OR, 3.13; 95% CI, 1.3-7.2), a lifetime working outdoors (OR, 2.98; 95% CI, 1.5-5.7), smoking more than 10 cigarettes a day (OR, 2.96; 95% CI, 1.3-6.5), actinic conjunctivitis (OR, 2.68; 95% CI, 1.2-5.9), poikiloderma of Civatte (OR, 3.29; 95% CI, 1.7-6.1), numerous facial actinic keratoses (OR, 9.23; 95% CI, 4.9-17.1), and numerous freckles (OR, 3.68; 95% CI, 1.3-10.1)., CONCLUSIONS: We have documented clinical characteristics and personal history factors that should guide the physician in making decisions on the preventive and follow-up measures to be adopted for individuals at risk of squamous cell carcinoma. These findings may help guide policy for controlling the disease using local information. Copyright © 2012 Elsevier Espana, S.L. and AEDV. All rights reserved.",Excluded

The results obtained in the treatment of tongue base carcinomas using gamma photon of a Cobalt Unit and 'half beam shielding blocks' technique are reported. Methods. From January 1988 through December 1995, 69 patients affected with tongue base carcinoma were treated with radiation therapy at the Radiotherapy Department of Umberto I Hospital in Mestre, Italy. The patients were mostly males (M:F=4.75:1), their age ranging from 39-85 years (mean: 64.2 years). Staging, performed according to TNM classification (UICC criteria) showed 17 cases in stage II, 19 in stage III and 33 in stage IV, with prevalence of squamous cell carcinoma. Seventeen patients were treated with radical surgery. All patients were treated with radiotherapy with gamma photon of a Cobalt Unit and using the 'half beam shielding blocks' technique and junction level on the hyoid axis. Treatment planning was always studied on an extensive number of CT scans on which target volume and normal tissues were defined and performed using Theraplan V05 program, Theratronics. The dose to the target volume was 50 Gy/25 fractions after radical surgery and 60 Gy/30 fractions for exclusive radiotherapy and after non radical surgery. Results. Overall 3-years and 5- years survival were 39% and 31% respectively (+/-0.0668), disease free 5-years survival was 39%. A better prognosis for initial stage lesions with statistically significant difference (p-value=0.0116), and for patients treated with radical surgery plus radiography (p-value=0.008) was obtained. Fifty-four patients obtained a complete remission; the other fifteen a partial remission. Twenty-one patients showed loco-regional relapse; thirty- six died, thirty of them with disease. Conclusions. The data obtained show that the 'half beam shielding blocks' technique can be used also with gamma photon of a Cobalt Unit, and that the local control wasn't obtained using the conventional doses and radiotherapy technique. Better results should be obtained using new radiotherapy techniques and new combined approaches.",Excluded

OBJECTIVE: Evaluation of computed tomography (CT) attenuation measurements for assessing bone mineral density (BMD) and predicting osteoporosis in thoracic and abdominal CT scans for various clinical indications using dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) as reference standard., RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: A total of 234 patients (147 women, 87 men) undergoing DXA and CT were examined retrospectively. Mean time between both studies was 0.5 years. CT-attenuation values in Hounsfield units (HU) were measured at the thoracic and lumbar spine (T1, T6, T12, L1-L5), at the femoral neck, and then assigned to their corresponding DXA scores., RESULTS: Patients with DXA-defined osteoporosis or osteopenia showed significantly lower HU values of trabecular bone at all measured levels compared to healthy subjects (p < 0.001). HU values were highest at T1 and T6, lowest at L1-L3 and the femoral neck. There were no significant intraindividual differences between HU values in the sagittal, coronal or transversal plane. Significant differences between normal and abnormal BMD categories were verified for three CT scanners. More than half of all fractures were detected in patients with non-osteoporotic DXA T-scores., CONCLUSIONS: Abdominal and particularly thoracic CT scans obtained for other clinical indications can sensibly be applied toward determining low BMD, detecting osteoporosis and identifying persons at increased fracture risk. Osteoporotic morbidity and mortality might be minimized. Superiorly to DXA, fragility fractures can be found without additional imaging or radiation exposure which can initiate early adequate treatment., LIMITATIONS: Key limitations of the study were as following: a retrospective, single-center study; small patient cohort - larger cohorts are needed to evaluate the sensitivity and specificity of diagnostic performance measurements; more complex CT evaluation of the hip for BMD assessment; DXA measurements were used as a reference standard, however, patients with unsuspected compression fractures but showing osteopenic or even normal BMD outline the limitations of DXA.",Excluded

OBJECTIVES: Through a survey on perception of lung cancer screening and accompanying medical radiation exposure in Korea, the present study was to investigate its current situations and evaluate various perception of physicians regarding it in order to propose measures for improvements., METHODS: Medical specialists in national cancer screening institutions selected through stratified random sampling were subjected to face-to-face interview using a structured questionnaire. We investigated physicians' perception on effectiveness of lung cancer screening depending on screening modality, selection criteria for subjects of screening, types of equipment used to screen, and perception for seriousness of adverse effects following the test. In addition, odds ratios to underestimate risk of radiation exposure from screening were calculated through logistic regression analysis., RESULTS: Each response that chest X-ray is effective for lung cancer screening and that smoking history is not considered prior to screening recommendation accounted for more than 60% of respondents, suggesting the chance of unnecessary screening tests. Regarding adverse effects of lung cancer screening, about 85% of respondents replied that false positive, radiation exposure, and overdiagnosis could be ignored. About 70% of respondents underestimated radiation dose from lung cancer screening, and a low proportion of physicians informed patients of radiation exposure risk., CONCLUSIONS: It was found that most physicians underestimated harms of lung cancer screening including radiation exposure and were lack of awareness regarding lung cancer screening. It should be noted that physicians need to have proper perceptions about screening recommendation and accompanying possible harms, for successful implementation of the screening program.",Excluded

Method(s): Three similarly treated patients with cAVM, 1 patient with symptomatic radionecrosis and 2 patients with normal post-radiation MRI changes, were selected and studied in detail with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), magnetic resonance angiography (MRA), and magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS). 2 cAVM were located in eloquent locations and were classified as Spetzler-Martin grade (SM) III such that interdisciplinary radiosurgery was recommended; a third patient with a left frontal SM II cAVM refused surgery. 1 patient was male, and 2 were female. The patient's ages ranged from 38 to 62 years (median, 39 years). The nidus volume (= planning target volume = PTV) ranged from 2.75 to 6.89 ccm (median, 6.41 ccm). The single dose was 20 Gy at the isocenter of the PTV encompassing the 80 - 90% isodose. The median follow-up period was 20 months (range, 16 - 84 months). Toxicities were evaluated with the Common Terminology Criteria (CTC) for adverse events version 3.0. Result(s): No patient suffered a bleeding from cAVM during the study period. A complete nidus occlusion was shown in all patients with time-resolved MRA. All patients showed radiogenic MRI changes, 1 patient showed excessive radionecrosis. This patient was oligosymptomatic and under temporary corticoid therapy symptoms resolved completely.Following patterns associated with radionecrosis in the MRS studies were identified in our collective:. * 2D spectroscopic imaging (2D-SI) revealed much lower concentrations of metabolites in the lesion as compared to contralateral healthy tissue in all patients.* Whereas regions with regular post-radiosurgery effects showed almost normal levels of Cho and a Cho/Cr ratio < 2.0, regions with radionecrosis were characterized by increased lipid levels and a Cho/Cr ratio > 2.0 in conjunction with decreased absolute levels of all metabolites, especially of Cr and NAA. Conclusion(s): MRS is an increasingly valuable tool for the differential diagnosis of radiation reactions. Specific patterns of MRS spectra in radionecrosis were identified; in synopsis with clinical parameters, these changes have to be taken into account to avoid misdiagnosis. © 2013 Bostrom et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",Excluded
1786,"High-pitch dual-source CT angiography of the thoracic and abdominal aorta: is simultaneous coronary artery assessment possible?. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to prospectively evaluate the average heart rate and heart rate variability required for diagnostic imaging of the coronary arteries with high-pitch dual-source CT angiography of the thoracic and thoracoabdominal aorta., SUBJECTS AND METHODS: One hundred consecutively registered patients (82 men, 18 women; mean age, 68 +/- 13 years) underwent clinically indicated CT angiography of the thoracic (n = 33) and thoracoabdominal (n = 67) aorta with a dual-source 128-MDCT scanner in ECG-synchronized high-pitch (pitch, 3.2) data acquisition mode. No beta-blockers were administered. The image quality of the coronary arteries was graded on a 3-point scale by two independent blinded readers. The average heart rate and heart rate variability before data acquisition were noted. Effective radiation doses were calculated., RESULTS: Interobserver agreement on grade of image quality for the 1,414 coronary segments evaluated by both observers was good (kappa = 0.68). Diagnostic image quality was found for 1,375 of the 1,414 segments (97.2%) in 83 of 100 patients (83%). In 17% of the patients, image quality was nondiagnostic for at least one coronary artery segment. Average heart rate and heart rate variability (each p < 0.05) were significantly higher in patients with at least one nondiagnostic coronary segment compared with those without. All patients with an average heart rate less than 63 beats/min and heart rate variability less than 1.2 beats/min had diagnostic image quality in all coronary segments. Effective radiation doses were 2.3 +/- 0.3 mSv for thoracic and 4.4 +/- 0.5 mSv for thoracoabdominal CT angiography. The average scan times were 0.88 +/- 0.06 second for thoracic and 1.67 +/- 0.15 seconds for thoracoabdominal CT angiography., CONCLUSION: For patients with an average heart rate less than 63 beats/min and heart rate variability less than 1.2 beats/min, dual-source CT angiography of the thoracoabdominal aorta at a high pitch of 3.2 delivers diagnostic depiction of the coronary arteries at a low radiation dose.",Excluded
1912,"Improved visualization of the urinary tract in multidetector CT urography (MDCTU): analysis of individual acquisition delay and opacification using furosemide and low-dose test images. PURPOSE: To retrospectively analyze the reliability of opacification and image quality of a modified MDCTU examination protocol using furosemide and an individual acquisition delay by low-dose test images, MATERIALS AND METHODS: Excretory phase images obtained from 4-row and 16-row MSCTU examinations in 103 patients (69 men, 34 women) were independently reviewed by two radiologists. MDCTUs were performed by using a low-dose furosemide iv injection. No fixed delay for urographic image acquisition was applied. Urographic timing was individually adjusted by performing low-dose test images of the distal ureters to display their current opacification. Image analysis included grading of opacification and image quality of the segmented collecting system. Average urographic delay was calculated. Stratified comparisons of mean scores were assessed. Interobserver kappa values were calculated., RESULTS: Calculated median scan delay for patients with normal creatine levels (n = 92) was 420 sec (mean 453 sec; SD, 121 sec). The median number of acquired test images was 2 (range 1-6 images). The analysis of opacification demonstrated that 97% of the ICS, 89% of the proximal, 86% of the middle, and 81% of the distal ureter segments showed opacification greater than 90%. 7.8% of the distal ureteral segments could not be visualized. Statistics did not show significant differences of opacification between proximal, middle, and distal ureteral segments (P > 0.05). Overall image quality of MSCTU showed to be high when latest test images indicated homogeneous bilateral contrasted ureters (Pearson correlation coefficient r= 0.81). Interobserver kappa values were 0.8 and 0.78., CONCLUSION: Furosemide and scan delay timing by means of test images for MDCTU proved to be a reliable procedure to reach improved opacification of the upper urinary tract. It features the individual adaption of MDCTU to the excretory rate of the kidneys.",Excluded
3620,"Five-year outcome of stand-alone fusion using carbon cages in cervical disc arthrosis. From January 1, 2001 to December 31, 2003, in the Neurosurgery Department of Rome University o ""Sapienza,"" 167 patients underwent anterior surgery for cervical spondylodiscoarthrosis. The levels treated by the anterior stand-alone technique were: C3-C4 (11%), C4-C5 (19%), C5-C6 (40%), and C6-C7 (30%). All patients underwent left anterior presternocleidomastoid-precarotid approach, microdiscectomy, and interbody fusion using a carbon fiber cage filled with hydroxyapatite. All patients were discharged within 48 h after surgery with cervical orthosis. In one case, a hematoma of the surgical site occurred within 12 h of surgery; for this reason the patient underwent surgical revision and was discharged 4 days later. All patients have worn cervical orthosis for a mean period of 7 weeks and underwent radiological follow-up with cervical RX at 1 and 3 months after surgery. All patients underwent follow-up from 54 to 90 months after surgery, and all of them underwent cervical RX, cervical CT scans for the estimate of fusion, and evaluation of neurological status using VAS and NDI. Of 167 patients, 132 were cooperative for this study, 18 were non-cooperative, and 17 died. The estimation of fusion made by cervical CT scans with sagittal reconstruction showed complete osteointegration of the cage in 115 patients (87.1%), while it showed pseudoarthrosis in 17 patients (12.9%). In 24 patients, we observed adjacent segment degeneration, and 13 of these underwent new surgical procedures in this institute or in another hospital. Clinical evaluation with VAS and NDI showed a good outcome, with poorest benefit in patients over 60 years. The clinical analysis showed a good fusion rate in according with literature, 13% of non-fusion rate without clinical evidence and 20% of ASDegeneration but only 10% had required new surgery. We also observed that patients over 60 years of age had less satisfactory outcome, probably related with the evolution of pathophysiological degeneration of the cervical spine. In the opinion, pseudoarthrosis is caused by malpositioning of the carbon fiber cage. © 2011 Springer-Verlag.",Excluded

1897,"Phase I-II study of radiopeptide 177Lu-octreotate in combination with capecitabine and temozolomide in advanced low-grade neuroendocrine tumors. We conducted a phase I-II clinical trial to assess the safety and efficacy of combining lutetium-177 (177Lu)-octreotate with capecitabine and temozolomide in treating advanced low-grade neuroendocrine tumors (NETs). All 35 patients received fixed activities of 7.8 GBq 177Lu-octreotate each 8 weeks, with 14 days of capecitabine 1500 mg/m2 for 4 cycles. In phase I, successive cohorts of patients received escalating doses of temozolomide in groupings of 100, 150, and 200 mg/m2 in the last 5 days of each capecitabine cycle. In phase II, patients were treated with 200 mg/m2 temozolomide. Treatment was well tolerated in all dosage groups. No dose-limiting grade 2, 3, or 4 toxicities were seen in cohorts 1 (100 mg/m2) or 2 (150 mg/m2). Twenty-eight patients completed treatment at the 200 mg/m2 temozolomide level. Adverse events were mild to moderate. The commonest toxicities were transient nausea grade 2 (18%), grade 3 (3%), thrombocytopenia grade 2 (24%), and neutropenia grade 3 (6%). There were no grade 4 events. Thirty-four patients were evaluable for tumor response. Overall, complete response (CR) was achieved in 15% (95% CI 3-27); partial response (PR), in 38% (95% CI 22-55); stable disease (SD), in 38% (95% CI 22-55); and 3 patients failed to respond to treatment. Median progression free survival (PFS) was 31 months (95% CI 21-33), and median overall survival (OS) has not been reached with 90% surviving at 24 months follow-up (range 21-30). Overall objective response rate (ORR) in patients with gastroenteropancreatic NETs showed CR 16% (95% CI 3-28), PR 41% (95% CI 24-58), SD 37% (95% CI 21-54), and PD 6% (95% CI 0-15).

8,"Outcomes of carotid angioplasty and stenting for radiation-associated stenosis. BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: In light of their high surgical risk, carotid angioplasty and stent placement may be preferred in patients with radiation-associated carotid stenosis. The purpose of this study was to determine the procedural complication rate, patency, and clinical outcomes after carotid angioplasty and stent placement in this small group of high-risk patients., METHODS: Sixteen patients (mean age, 65 years; 5 women and 11 men) who received radiation therapy for head and/or neck malignancy subsequently developed carotid stenosis (mean, 84%; range, 70%-99%) in a total of 19 carotid arteries, which were treated with angioplasty and stent placement. The patients were followed for a mean time of 28 months (range, 5-78 months) with periodic Doppler studies, angiography, CT angiography, or clinically., RESULTS: In the total 19 stented carotid arteries, 23 procedures were performed (22 stent placement procedures and one repeat angioplasty). The procedural stroke rate was 1/23 (4%). The procedural transient ischemic attack rate was 0/23 (0%). There was one other observed complication: a puncture site hematoma. The 30-day postprocedure complication rate was 0/23 (0%); no neurologic symptoms were reported. Fifteen of the 19 vessels (79%) developed no new stenosis throughout the follow-up period. Two of 19 (11%) vessels had repeat angioplasty and stent placement; 1/19 (5%) had a repeat angioplasty. One restented vessel has remained patent for 50 months. Another restented vessel required a third stent placement 17 months after the second. Two of 19 (11%) vessels occluded per Doppler examination 14 and 22 months postprocedure., CONCLUSION: Angioplasty and stent placement have low rates of complications and restenosis in the treatment of radiation-associated carotid occlusive disease.",Excluded
2048,"Intracoronary beta-brachytherapy using a rhenium-188 filled balloon catheter in restenotic lesions of native coronary arteries and venous bypass grafts. Purpose: We have previously demonstrated the efficacy of intracoronary beta-brachytherapy using a liquid 188Re-filled balloon in a randomised trial including de novo lesions. Percutaneous coronary interventions in restenotic lesions and in stenoses of venous bypass grafts are characterised by a high recurrence rate for restenosis and re-interventions. Against this background, we wanted to assess the impact of intracoronary beta-brachytherapy using a liquid 188Re-filled balloon in restenotic lesions in native coronary arteries and venous bypass grafts. Method(s): In 243 patients, beta-brachytherapy with 22.5 Gy was applied at a tissue depth of 0.5 mm. Patients were followed up angiographically after 6 months and clinically for 12 months. The primary clinical endpoint was the incidence of MACE (death, myocardial infarction, target vessel revascularisation). Secondary angiographic endpoints were late loss and binary restenosis rate in the total segment. Result(s): All irradiation procedures were successfully performed. A total of 222 lesions were in native coronary arteries; 21 were bypass lesions. Mean irradiation length was 41.6+/-17.3 mm (range 20-150 mm) in native coronary arteries and 48.1+/-33.9 mm (range 30-180 mm) in bypass lesions; the reference diameter was 2.57+/-0.52 mm and 2.83+/-0.76 mm, respectively. There was no vessel thrombosis during antiplatelet therapy. Angiographic/clinical follow-up rate was 84%/100%. MACE rate was 17.6% in the native coronary artery group and 38.1% in the CABG group (p<0.03). Binary restenosis rate was 22.5% and 55.6% (p<0.01), and late loss was 0.38+/-0.72 mm and 1.33+/-1.11 mm (p<0.001), respectively. Conclusion(s): We conclude that intracoronary beta-brachytherapy with a liquid 188Re-filled balloon using 22.5 Gy at a tissue depth of 0.5 mm in restenotic lesions is safe. It is associated with a low binary restenosis rate, resulting in a low occurrence rate of MACE within 12 months in restenotic lesions in native coronary arteries but not in vein grafts. © 2006 Springer-Verlag.",Excluded
2318,"Laboratory selection for an accelerated mosquito sexual development rate. BACKGROUND: Separating males and females at the early adult stage did not ensure the virginity of females of Anopheles arabiensis (Dongola laboratory strain), whereas two years earlier this method had been successful. In most mosquito species, newly emerged males and females are not able to mate successfully. For anopheline species, a period of 24 h post-emergence is generally required for the completion of sexual maturation, which in males includes a 180° rotation of the genitalia. In this study, the possibility of an unusually shortened sexual maturity period in the laboratory-reared colony was investigated.
METHODS: The effect of two different sex-separation methods on the virginity of females was tested: females separated as pupae or less than 16 h post-emergence were mated with males subjected to various doses of radiation. T-tests were performed to compare the two sex-separation methods. The rate of genitalia rotation was compared for laboratory-reared and wild males collected as pupae in Dongola, Sudan, and analysed by Z-tests. Spermatheca dissections were performed on females mated with laboratory-reared males to determine their insemination status.
RESULTS: When the sex-separation was performed when adults were less than 16 h post-emergence, expected sterility was never reached for females mated with radio-sterilized males. Expected sterility was accomplished only when sexes were separated at the pupal stage. Observation of genitalia rotation showed that some males from the laboratory strain Dongola were able to successfully mate only 11 h after emergence and 42% of the males had already completed rotation. A small proportion of the same age females were inseminated. Wild males showed a much slower genitalia rotation rate. At 17 h post-emergence, 96% of the laboratory-reared males had completed genitalia rotation whereas none of the wild males had.
CONCLUSION: This colony has been cultured in the laboratory for over one hundred generations, and now has accelerated sexual maturation when compared with the wild strain. This outcome demonstrates the kinds of selection that can be expected during insect colonization and maintenance, particularly when generations are non-overlapping and similar-age males must compete for mates.",Excluded
613,"Does hyperbaric oxygen administration before or after irradiation decrease side effects of irradiation on implant sites?. One of the main limitations of implant-based breast reconstruction is the high rate of complications such as capsular contracture and poor aesthetic outcome, due to adjuvant radiotherapy. Hyperbaric oxygen treatment (HBOT) has been used to assist wound healing in the prevention and treatment of the side effects of irradiation. We aimed to investigate this effect of HBOT on the capsule reaction and skin, applied before and after irradiation, following the placement of an implant under the dorsal skin of the rat. Fifteen Wistar rats were randomly divided into 3 groups. A 18-mL smooth testicular implant was introduced into a subcutaneous pocket located on the dorsum of each rat. A single dose of 17-Gy irradiation was given to the implanted area of each rat at the third week. HBOT which lasted 3 weeks was administered to group I before irradiation, group II after irradiation. The control group did not receive HBOT. All of the rats were killed at the ninth week (6 weeks after irradiation). The dorsal skin with the capsule overlying the implant were excised for histopathological processing. The thickness of the capsule reaction of each group was evaluated statistically. Our histopathological examination revealed changes due to radiation in the control group. Many of these findings were found to be more subtle in group I and nearly absent in the group II. There was not any statistical difference between the thickness of the capsule reactions of the control group and group I, or group I and group II, but the capsular thickness of the control group was statistically higher than group II. It can be predicted that the use of HBOT following irradiation is an effective tool to reduce the capsule reaction of the implanted area and the tissue damage seen in radiodermatitis.",Excluded
641,"Radon awareness and mitigation in Vermont: a public health survey. Radon exposure is associated with an increased incidence of lung cancer, and elevated levels may be found in as many as 1 out of 15 homes. The U.S. EPA recommends testing homes for radon and mitigating over the advisory level of 4 picocuries per liter (4 pCi L(-1), or 148 Bq m(-3)). A sample population from a list of Vermont residents who had tested their residence for radon through the Vermont Department of Health and who had elevated levels were mailed a survey to assess demographic characteristics, knowledge about radon, mitigation rates, types of mitigation, as well as barriers to mitigation. The response rate was 63%. Forty-three percent of respondents mitigated. Roughly half were not completely knowledgeable of radon based upon the ability to associate radon exposure with lung cancer risk. Reasons not to mitigate radon levels in homes were cost and lack of concern over elevated levels. A multivariate logistic regression analysis revealed factors associated with mitigating: an education level of college or higher (p = 0.02), concern that a high radon level would affect real estate value (p = 0.04), and home age less than 10 y (p = 0.05). In summary, less than half of Vermonters with elevated radon levels participating in the Department of Health program mitigated.

711,"Imaging Findings Within the First 12 Months of Hepatocellular Carcinoma Treated With Stereotactic Body Radiation Therapy. Purpose: To correlate the imaging findings of treated hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) after stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) with explant pathology and alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) response. Methods and Materials: From 2007 to 2015, of 146 patients treated with liver SBRT for Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer stage A hepatocellular carcinoma, 10 were identified with inclusion criteria and had regular interval follow-up magnetic resonance imaging/triple phase computed tomography and explant pathology or declining AFP values for radiology-pathology response correlation. Reference standards for successful response were >90% necrosis on explant pathology or pretreatment AFP >75 ng/mL normalizing to <10 ng/mL within 1 year after SBRT without other treatment. Subjects were treated with 24 to 50 Gy in 3 to 5 fractions. Multiphasic magnetic resonance imaging or computed tomography performed at 3, 6, 9, and 12 months after SBRT was compared with pretreatment imaging by 2 expert radiologists. Descriptive statistics were calculated. Result(s): There were 10 subjects with 10 treated HCCs, classified as 3 Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network (OPTN) 5a, 4 OPTN 5b, and 3 OPTN 5x. All had successfully treated HCCs, according to explant pathology or declining AFP. Four of 10 HCCs had persistent central arterial hyperenhancement 3 to 12 months after SBRT; persistent wash-out was common up to 12 months (9 of 10). Of 10 treated HCCs, 9 exhibited decreased size at 12 months. Liver parenchyma adjacent to the lesion showed early (3-6 months) hyperemia followed by late (6-12 months) capsular retraction and delayed enhancement. No patient had a significant decline in liver function. Conclusion(s): In the absence of increasing size, persistent central arterial hyperenhancement and wash-out can occur within the first 12 months after SBRT in successfully treated HCCs and may not represent residual viable tumor. Liver parenchyma adjacent to the treated lesion showed inflammation followed by fibrosis, without significant change in hepatic function. Until a radiologic signature of tumor control is determined, freedom from local progression seems to be the best measure of HCC control after SBRT.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Inc.",Excluded
1370,"Nuclear medicine in the acute clinical setting: indications, imaging findings, and potential pitfalls. Nuclear medicine imaging provides valuable functional information that complements information obtained with anatomic imaging techniques in the evaluation of patients with specific acute clinical manifestations. Nuclear medicine studies are most often used in conjunction with other imaging modalities and as a problem-solving tool. Under certain circumstances a nuclear medicine study may be indicated as the first-line imaging modality, as in the case of renal scintigraphy for transplant dysfunction in the early postoperative period. Nuclear imaging may be preferred when a conventional first-line study is contraindicated or when it is important to minimize radiation exposure. The portability of nuclear imaging offers particular advantages for the evaluation of critically ill patients whose clinical condition is unstable and who cannot be safely transported out of the intensive care unit. The ability to visualize physiologic and pathophysiologic processes over relatively long time periods without adding to the patient's radiation exposure contributes to the high diagnostic sensitivity of several types of nuclear medicine studies. Viewing the acquired images in the cine mode adds to the value of these studies for diagnosing and characterizing dynamic abnormalities such as intermittent internal bleeding and bile or urine leakage. In this pictorial review, the spectrum of nuclear medicine studies commonly performed in the acute care setting is reviewed according to body systems and organs, with detailed descriptions of the indications, technical considerations, findings, and potential pitfalls of each type of study.

1601,"Endovascular Treatment of Long Superficial Femoral Artery-Chronic Total Occlusions Using the Gogo Catheter With IVUS Via a Popliteal Puncture Method Is Effective, Safe, and Useful. Objectives: We aimed to investigate the usefulness of inserting a 6Fr sheath guided by duplex ultrasonography via a popliteal artery puncture. We also aimed to demonstrate endoluminal tracking using a retrograde approach using the Gogo catheter with intravascular ultrasound (IVUS). Background(s): The bidirectional approach is useful for increasing the success rate of the procedure for long superficial femoral artery-chronic total occlusions (SFA-CTOs). However, this procedure becomes somewhat complicated. Since the proximal blood vessel diameter is clearly larger than the distal end of the CTO and the body surface duplex guide can also be used in the proximal part, it is easier to introduce a retrograde guidewire (GW) into the proximal end. Method(s): We performed endovascular treatment for long SFA-CTOs with a Gogo catheter + IVUS guide in 31 consecutive cases (male 20/female 11; mean age, 75.6 +/- 7.6) from May 2017 to November 2018. We advanced the IVUS until the true lumen could be confirmed and advanced the Gogo catheter toward the IVUS for reinforcement. We attempted to approach the long CTO by repeating this procedure. We named this procedure the GIP method (GIP: Gogo catheter with IVUS via a popliteal puncture). Hemostasis of the popliteal artery was achieved using a commercially available compression hemostatic kit (Tometa-kun, XEMEX, Japan). Result(s): Successful revascularization was achieved in all cases (in 2 cases, a femoral artery puncture was added, and a bidirectional approach was used, and in 1 case, a CROSSER system was used). On average, the fluoroscopy time was 42.2 +/- 30.4 minutes, radiation dose 93.7 +/- 78.7 mGy, and amount of contrast medium used 15.0 +/- 9.6 mL. The procedure time was defined as from the start of the popliteal artery puncture to the time the GW passed through the CTO lesion, including the posture transformation time from prone to the supine position. The procedure time was 42.1 +/- 40.2 minutes. There were no major adverse events or other major complications, such as a distal embolism, rupture of the CTO lesion, arteriovenous fistula, or major hematoma requiring a transfusion or surgical treatment. Only 2 small hematomas occurred at the popliteal artery puncture site. The patients were treated conservatively and were discharged as usual. Conclusion(s): Endovascular treatment of long SFA-CTOs via the popliteal approach was effective and safe. Using the GIP method to address long SFA-CTOs is recommended.Copyright © The Author(s) 2020.",Excluded

The purpose of this study was to determine the reliability of motor-evoked potentials (MEPs) produced in the abductor digiti minimi (ADM) muscle of male and female older adults, both within and between sessions. The number of trials within a session required to obtain reliable results was also examined. The investigation was conducted on 30 elderly individuals (15 M, 15 F; mean age 76 years). With the ADM at rest, MEPs were evoked at intensities of 1.1, 1.3, and 1.5 times motor threshold (MT). Ten stimuli were delivered at each intensity, with 10-12s between stimuli. The MEP responses were blocked with two, three, four, and five-stimuli means in each block. An intraclass correlation (ICC) reliability analysis of variance model was used to assess reliability of the MEP amplitude, using a variable number of trials per block. A subset of 10 subjects repeated the protocol following 20min of rest to assess the reliability between sessions. As expected, MEP amplitudes were significantly higher as stimulus intensity increased. There were no significant differences between blocks, nor was there a significant gender effect. ICC reliability coefficients ranged between 0.09 with two trials per block and 0.97 with five trials per block. Between session reliability ranged from 0.65 to 0.83. Highly reliable MEP amplitudes can be obtained in older individuals using two blocks of TMS stimuli with five trials per block.",Excluded
2924,"The second oncogenic step. Three theories of the development of a malignant change which each involve two successive steps are described. Armitage, Doll (1957) proposed that two homologous chromosomes each contained a region which was critical in the control of cell division. The two steps were mutations in these regions brought about by random exposure to carcinogenic agents. Comings (1973) proposed a similar theory but the two steps were considered to be spontaneous mutatons. This paper points out that if one mutation has occurred this can become dominant in at least six ways which mostly involve chromosome translocations. The synergism between oncogenic agents and ionizing radiation and the ability to breed out high and low cancer incidence stocks of animals from a common stock can be explained on the same lines.",Excluded

Objective: To investigate the image quality and nodules detectability using ultra-low dose (ULD) protocol with iterative model reconstruction (IMR) algorithm when compared to routine low dose (LD) chest CT in lung cancer screening. methods: Chest CT scans were acquired using a 256-slice scanner for 300 subjects. The scan protocol for the ULD group was 120 kVp/17 mAs while for the LD group was 120 kVp/30 mAs. All images were reconstructed with filtered back projection (FBP), hybrid iterative reconstruction (HIR) and IMR algorithms. Effective dose was recorded. Image quality assessments were performed by two radiologists. SD of CT attenuation was measured as objective image noise. The number of non-calcified nodules detected in both groups with different reconstruction algorithms were calculated and compared. Result(s): The effective dose of ULD group (0.67 +/- 0.08mSv) was about 44% reduced compared with LD group (1.20 +/- 0.08mSv) (p < 0.01). IMR improved image quality and reduced image noise significantly than HIR and FBP in both groups (all, p < 0.01). IMR enabled a higher number of nodule detected compared to FBP and HIR in both LD and ULD groups, especially for solid nodules less than 4mm. conclusion: IMR may improve the diagnostic accuracy of ULD CT lung screening with potential nodule detectability improvement. advances in knowledge: IMR enables significant reduction of the image noise and improvement of image quality in sub-mSv (66% reduction) chest scans.Copyright © 2017 The Authors.

All 4 patients had been treated with various bronchoscopic interventions, including dilation and stenting, electrocautery ablation, and neodymium:yttrium-aluminum-garnet laser therapy. High dose rate endobronchial brachytherapy was subsequently used in all 4 patients for management of recurrent airway obstruction. The radiation dose for all 4 patients was 3 Gy at a distance of 1 cm from the center of the catheter., RESULTS: All four patients have had routine follow-up after endobronchial brachytherapy treatments. Of the 4 patients, 2 treated with this modality showed a significant response to therapy in that the bronchus remained free of obstruction after treatment; 1 patient had partial improvement, and 1 patient failed to show significant improvement and expired from the sequelae of persistent airway obstruction., CONCLUSIONS: Endobronchial brachytherapy can be an effective modality for managing recurrent stenoses caused by hyperplastic granulation tissue at the bronchial anastomosis. The optimal timing and ideal candidate for intraluminal radiation therapy for this problem remains a challenge and warrants further investigation.",Excluded
1883,"Stereotactic Ablative Radiotherapy for the Management of Liver Metastases from Neuroendocrine Neoplasms: A Preliminary Study. INTRODUCTION: Liver metastases are common in patients with neuroendocrine neoplasms. The role of stereotactic ablative radiotherapy (SABR) is not well understood in this population. OBJECTIVE(S): To evaluate the safety and efficacy of SABR in treating well-differentiated neuroendocrine liver metastases (WD-NELM). METHOD(S): A retrospective review of patients with WD-NELM treated with SABR between January 2015-July 2019. Demographic, treatment and clinical/radiographic follow-up data were abstracted. RECIST 1.1 criteria were applied to each individual target to evaluate the response to treatment. Local control (LC) and progression free survival (PFS) were determined using Kaplan-Meier methodology. Toxicity was reported according to CTCAE v5.0. RESULT(S): Twenty-five patients with a total of 53 liver metastases treated with SABR were identified. Most patients (68%) had midgut tumors, were Grade II (80%) and had high volume intrahepatic and/or extrahepatic disease (76%). Median number of liver metastases treated was 2 with a median size of 2.5 cm. Median radiation dose delivered was 50Gy/5 fractions. Median follow-up was 14 months; 24 of the 25 patients were alive at time of analysis. The objective response rate (ORR) was 32%, with improvement or stability in 96% of lesions treated. The median time to best response was 9 months. The 1-year LC and PFS were 92% and 44% respectively. No Grade III/IV acute or late toxicity was identified. CONCLUSION(S): Liver SABR is a safe and promising means of providing local control for WD-NELM. This treatment modality should be evaluated in select patients in concert with strategies to manage systemic disease.Copyright © 2021 S. Karger AG, Basel.",Excluded
3114,"Treatment of nonresectable hepatocellular carcinoma with intrahepatic 90Y-microspheres. Treatment for nonresectable hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is palliative. The relatively greater arteriolar density of hepatic tumors compared with normal liver suggests that intrahepatic arterial administration of 90Y-microspheres can be selectively deposited in tumor nodules and results in significantly greater radiation exposure to the tumor than external irradiation. The purpose of this study was to determine the proportion (frequency) and duration of response, survival, and toxicity after intrahepatic arterial injection of 90Y-microspheres in patients with HCC. Method(s): Patients with documented HCC, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status 0-3, adequate bone marrow, and hepatic and pulmonary function were eligible for study. Patients who had significant shunting of blood to the lungs or gastrointestinal (GI) tract or who could not undergo cannulation of the hepatic artery were excluded. Patients received a planned dose of 100 Gy through a catheter placed into the hepatic artery. Result(s): Twenty-two patients were treated with 90Y-microspheres; 20 of the treated patients (median age, 62.5 y) were evaluated for treatment efficacy. Nine patients were Okuda stage I, and 11 were Okuda stage II. The median dose delivered was 104 Gy (range, 46-145 Gy). All 22 treated patients experienced at least 1 adverse event. Of the 31 (15%) serious adverse events, the most common were elevations in liver enzymes and bilirubin and upper GI ulceration. The response rate was 20%. The median duration of response was 127 wk; the median survival was 54 wk. Multivariable analysis suggested that a dose >104 Gy (P = 0.06), tumor-to-liver activity uptake ratio >2 (P = 0.06), and Okuda stage I (P = 0.07) were associated with longer survival. Conclusion(s): Significantly higher doses of radiation can be delivered to a HCC tumor by intrahepatic arterial administration of 90Y-microspheres than by external beam radiation. This treatment appears to be beneficial in nonresectable HCC with acceptable toxicity.",Excluded
1473,"Application of Digital Tomosynthesis in the Diagnosis of Urolithiasis: Comparison with MDCT. Objective: To investigate the diagnostic value of digital tomosynthesis in urolithiasis compared with multidetector computed tomography (MDCT). Subjects and Methods: This study received the approval of institutional review board and obtained the informed consents of all subjects. Fifty patients with acute renal colic and hematuria from February 2014 to February 2015 were enrolled. They underwent both MDCT and digital tomosynthesis. Images were interpreted by two experienced radiologists, and inter-reader agreement was assessed. The diagnostic performance of urinary stones with digital tomosynthesis and MDCT was compared. The entrance surface dose (ESD) in MDCT and digital tomosynthesis for patients was measured and compared. Result(s): No significant difference was found between digital tomosynthesis and MDCT in the diagnosis of urinary stones (X2 = 1.357, p > 0.05). The ESD in digital tomosynthesis was lower than that in both routine-dose and low-dose MDCT for patients (p < 0.05). Conclusion(s): Digital tomosynthesis has great diagnostic value in urolithiasis. Compared with MDCT, digital tomosynthesis can significantly decrease ESD for patients and financial loan with a similar detection rate.Copyright © Mary Ann Liebert, Inc., publishers 2020.",Excluded
2989,"Intra-arterial chemotherapy less intensive than RADPLAT with concurrent radiotherapy for resectable advanced head and neck squamous cell carcinoma: A prospective study. Objectives: This study was designed to evaluate the efficacy and feasibility of our intra-arterial chemotherapy protocol with a lower amount and frequency of cisplatin delivery than in RADPLAT for the treatment of resectable advanced head and neck cancer. Method(s): Fifty-one patients with advanced squamous cell carcinoma of the oral cavity, oropharynx, hypopharynx, or larynx were included in this prospective study. The patients were treated with 3 courses of cisplatin (100 mg at 1 treatment, intra-arterial) and sodium thiosulfate (28 g at 1 treatment, intravenous) once every 2 weeks during concurrent radiotherapy (66 to 70 Gy, 2 Gy per fraction, daily for 5 days over 7 weeks). Nodal metastases larger than 3 cm in diameter were treated with an additional 50 mg of cisplatin. The patients with less than 50% tumor reduction after 40 Gy and 2 courses of chemotherapy were treated with surgery. Result(s): The protocol was completed for 49 patients. All living patients had a minimum follow-up period of 2 years. Including the 3 patients with salvage surgery, local disease-free control was achieved in 39 patients (80%). For 36 patients (73.5%), disease-free primary organs were preserved at 2 years after treatment. Locoregional disease-free control for 2 years was obtained for 38 patients (77.6%), in 30 of them without salvage surgery. The patients treated with surgery had an overall survival rate similar to that of the patients with a complete response (80% and 84.6%, respectively). The patients with a partial response had a worse prognosis (40%; p = .0069).

OBJECTIVE To retrospectively evaluate the absorbed doses of organs at risk, such as lungs and the heart of the patients who underwent radiotherapy (RT) using the voluntary deep inspiration breath-hold (vDIBH) technique, and to compare the results with the literature. METHODS In this study, 102 patients who underwent adjuvant RT for the treatment of breast cancer in our clinic between November 2018 and December 2019 were included. A breast and/or chest wall, and/or lymph node RT of 50 Gy in 25 fractions was planned for all patients, and an additional boost of 10 Gy in five fractions was planned for patients requiring an RT boost. The treatment plans included 3DCRT, Field in Field (FIF), IMRT and VMAT approaches. RESULTS In the group undergoing supraclavicular fossa RT, the mean V20Gy was found to be 24.8%, compared to 16% in the group not undergoing supraclavicular fossa RT (p<0.01). In the group undergoing mammaria interna RT, the mean heart dose was 3.1 Gy, compared to 2.1 Gy in the group not undergoing mammaria interna RT (p=0.04).

3067,"Models to study gravitational biology of Mammalian reproduction. Mammalian reproduction evolved within Earth's 1-g gravitational field. As we move closer to the reality of space habitation, there is growing scientific interest in how different gravitational states influence reproduction in mammals. Habitation of space and extended spaceflight missions require prolonged exposure to decreased gravity (hypogravity, i.e., weightlessness). Lift-off and re-entry of the spacecraft are associated with exposure to increased gravity (hypergravity). Existing data suggest that spaceflight is associated with a constellation of changes in reproductive physiology and function. However, limited spaceflight opportunities and confounding effects of various nongravitational factors associated with spaceflight (i.e., radiation, stress) have led to the development of ground-based models for studying the effects of altered gravity on biological systems. Human bed rest and rodent hindlimb unloading paradigms are used to study exposure to hypogravity. Centrifugation is used to study hypergravity. Here, we review the results of spaceflight and ground-based models of altered gravity on reproductive physiology. Studies utilizing ground-based models that simulate hyper- and hypogravity have produced reproductive results similar to those obtained from spaceflight and are contributing new information on biological responses across the gravity continuum, thereby confirming the appropriateness of these models for studying reproductive responses to altered gravity and the underlying mechanisms of these responses. Together, these unique tools are yielding new insights into the gravitational biology of reproduction in mammals.",Excluded
214,"The relationship between cumulative lifetime ultraviolet radiation exposure, bone mineral density, falls risk and fractures in older adults. Data linking cumulative lifetime vitamin D status with skeletal outcomes are lacking. We show that increasing cumulative sun exposure was associated with higher bone mineral density in younger males and protective against fractures in females independent of current vitamin D. This supports the concept that cumulative sun exposure is an important contributor to skeletal health., INTRODUCTION: While low 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels are associated with increased fracture risk, this reflects only recent sun exposure. The Beagley-Gibson (BG) method utilises microtopographical skin changes to quantify cumulative lifetime ultraviolet radiation (sun) exposure. This study aimed to describe the relationship between BG grade, BMD, falls risk and fractures in older adults., METHODS: Eight hundred thirty-five community-dwelling adults aged 53-83 years had silicone casts from the dorsum of both hands graded by the BG method. BMD was measured using DXA and falls risk using the short form of the Physiological Profile Assessment. Vertebral deformities and symptomatic fractures were assessed by DXA and questionnaire, respectively., RESULTS: The relationship between BG grade, spine BMD and vertebral fracture varied depending upon sex. In females, increasing grade was associated with lower vertebral fracture prevalence (OR = 0.44/grade, p = 0.018) and fewer fractures (OR = 0.82/grade, p = 0.021), particularly major fractures (OR = 0.75/grade, p = 0.03). In males, increasing grade was associated with more DXA-detected vertebral deformities (RR = 1.28/grade, p = 0.001), but not symptomatic fractures. These relationships were independent of BMD, falls risk, smoking and current 25-hydroxyvitamin D. BG grade was not associated with falls risk. For BMD, there were interactions between BG grade and both age and sex and a positive trend with hip BMD in younger males., CONCLUSIONS: BG grade demonstrated beneficial associations with fracture outcomes in females and BMD in younger males independent of current 25-hydroxyvitamin D. These data support the concept that cumulative ultraviolet radiation exposure is an important determinant of skeletal health. The association with vertebral deformities in males may reflect outdoor physical trauma in younger life.",Excluded
210,"Trimming the fat in acute ischemic stroke: an assessment of 24-h CT scans in tPA patients. BACKGROUND: International management of acute ischemic stroke patients treated with intravenous tissue plasminogen activator frequently includes 24-h head imaging. These recommendations stem from the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS) clinical trial protocol regarding the risk of intracerebral hemorrhage post-tissue plasminogen activator administration. Follow-up computed tomography scans on select patients, however, may not effect clinical management, resulting in unnecessary radiation exposure and healthcare costs., AIMS: Our study questions the utility of routine 24-h computed tomography imaging and looks at the National Institute of Health Stroke Scale as a possible clinical screen for selecting candidates for 24-h imaging. Such a tool would result in decreased radiation exposure to the patient and decreased cost to the hospital., METHODS: Consecutive patients with acute ischemic stroke given intravenous tissue plasminogen activator between June 2008 and December 2011 were retrospectively identified and dichotomized based on change in 24-h National Institute of Health Stroke Scale from baseline. Initial analysis compared patients with National Institute of Health Stroke Scale worsening to those without worsening. Subsequent analysis was limited to patients with a baseline National Institute of Health Stroke Scale <=10. Baseline demographics and medical history, baseline and 24-h computed tomography findings, medical and/or surgical orders within six-hours of imaging, and antithrombotic administration within 24-48-h postintravenous tissue plasminogen activator were compared between the two groups., RESULTS: Two-hundred patients met inclusion criteria: No 24-h National Institute of Health Stroke Scale worsening (n = 167) vs. 24-h National Institute of Health Stroke Scale worsening (n = 33). No baseline demographic or admission data differed significantly between the two groups. Patients without 24-h National Institute of Health Stroke Scale worsening had significantly lower incidence of hemorrhagic infarction (10.8% vs. 31.3%, P = 0.0014) on follow-up imaging. Less than 2% of all patients without 24-h National Institute of Health Stroke Scale worsening had a parenchymal hematoma. No patient with baseline National Institute of Health Stroke Scale <=10 and without 24-h National Institute of Health Stroke Scale worsening had parenchymal hematoma. Patients with 24-h worsening were significantly less likely to receive timely antithrombotic therapy (60.6% vs. 77.8%, odds ratio 0.44, 95% confidence interval 0.20-0.96)., CONCLUSIONS: Our results demonstrate that routine 24-h computed tomography scan in patients without 24-h National Institute of Health Stroke Scale worsening (especially those with baseline National Institute of Health Stroke Scale <=10) is less likely to yield information that results in a deviation from standard acute stroke care. No patient without worsening and baseline National Institute of Health Stroke Scale <=10 had parenchymal hematoma on 24-h computed tomography. Application of the National Institute of Health Stroke Scale to distinguish patients who should have 24-h follow-up imaging from those who will not benefit is a potential avenue for improving utilization of resources and warrants further study.

All the gamma-irradiated allografts (tibialis anterior tendons) received an irradiation dose of 2.5 Mrad before distribution. Patients in this study had undergone a preoperative magnetic resonance imaging scan and physical examination. Patients were excluded from the study if they had a concomitant injury to other knee ligaments, previous surgery on the injured knee, or articular cartilage lesions greater than Outerbridge grade II.

OBJECTIVES: To identify the factors that predict the progression of radiological radiation pneumonitis (RP) to symptomatic RP, and to evaluate the usefulness of the neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) as a marker of RP severity and prognosis in stage III non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients treated with definitive concurrent chemoradiotherapy (CCRT)., MATERIALS AND METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed 61 patients treated between January 2010 and December 2015. Patients' demographic characteristics, clinical data, laboratory findings and treatment parameters were analyzed to determine the predictive factors associated with progression from radiological RP to symptomatic RP., RESULTS: Forty-seven patients (77%) exhibited radiological RP at a median of 78 days after radiation therapy (RT) completion, and 15 (32%) of these patients developed symptomatic RP. The interval between RT completion and radiological RP presentation was shorter in patients who progressed to symptomatic RP (P = .001); progression was highly probable if this latency period was <=2 months (P = .002). Stage and RT technique correlated with symptomatic RP development (P = .046 and P = .046, respectively). Among dosimetric factors, a V20 (defined as the lung volume receiving >=20 Gy) of >30% was the most significant predictor of symptomatic RP (P = .001). The NLR and C-reactive protein level at radiological RP were higher in patients who developed symptomatic RP (P = .067 and P = .012, respectively). On multivariate analysis, a V20 >30% and an NLR at radiological RP >6 were associated with symptomatic RP development., CONCLUSION: The NLR at radiological RP is a useful biomarker for predicting symptomatic RP development after CCRT in stage III NSCLC patients.

With the advent of multislice CT scanners and the evolution of image processing methods this technique now affords optimal urographic images comparable to those obtained with conventional techniques. We describe the acquisition techniques and protocols used by the various authors. Effective radiation dose has conditioned the use of CT-Urography so that the tendency today is to reduce the number of scans by performing, after the nonenhanced scan, a single contrast-enhanced scan comprising both the nephrographic and urographic phase. With the use of multislice CT the quality of the urogram improves with the number of slices. We illustrate a variety of processing techniques, multiplanar reconstruction (MPR), maximum (MIP) and average intensity projection (AIP) and volume rendering (VR) and present a series of upper urinary tract tumours testifying to the superiority of the AIP technique over MIP. We then review the results of comparative studies of CT-Urography with conventional urography in upper urinary tract diagnostics.

530,"Energy and thermal regulation during bed rest and spaceflight. In planning for long-duration (1- to 2-yr) space missions (microgravity), the availability of oxygen, water, and food is critical for survival. If astronauts would consume approximately 3,100 kcal and 2.2 liters of fluid per day, the requirements for a 2-yr flight would be 2,263,000 kcal and 1,606 liters for each astronaut. These estimates, based on limited microgravity simulation and flight data, include 1 h/day of moderate isotonic exercise. Each 30-min/day reduction in exercise training time would save 110,869 kcal and 91 liters of water per year. One daily 5-h extravehicular sortie at an average work rate of 1.7 l/min would require an additional 529,250 kcal and 1,095 liters of water per year. Results from microgravity simulation (bed rest) experiments suggest that 1) there is uncertainty whether basal metabolism is unchanged, 2) submaximal ergometer exercise oxygen uptake appears to be unchanged or lower, and 3) without vigorous exercise training near peak levels, the peak oxygen uptake is definitely reduced. In addition, the equilibrium level of exercise core temperature is elevated excessively by approximately 0.5 degrees C after bed-rest acclimation. Changes in the efficiency of work or metabolism in any or all of these conditions could affect nutritional requirements for long spaceflights. Further research is necessary to elucidate the metabolic factors that would be changed and the energy cost of intra- and extravehicular activity during prolonged exposure to microgravity.",Excluded
1735,"Normalized Dual-Energy Iodine Ratio Best Differentiates Renal Cell Carcinoma Subtypes among Quantitative Imaging Biomarkers from Perfusion CT and Dual-Energy CT. OBJECTIVE. The objective of our study was to assess and compare the diagnostic accuracy of perfusion CT (PCT) and dual-energy CT (DECT) in differentiating clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) from non-ccRCC. MATERIALS AND METHODS. This retrospective study included 51 patients with 52 renal cell carcinomas (RCCs) (36 ccRCCs and 16 non-ccRCCs) who underwent both PCT and DECT before surgery or biopsy between January 2014 and December 2018. Three independent readers measured blood flow, blood volume (BV), and permeability using PCT and iodine concentration (IC) and iodine ratio using DECT. Interreader agreement was calculated using the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC). Multivariable logistic regression analysis was performed to assess PCT and DECT models. Size-specific dose estimates of the two methods were compared. RESULTS. BV (ICC, 0.93) and iodine ratio (ICC, 0.85) were the most reproducible parameters. Both PCT and DECT were significant models (p < 0.05, all readers) for differentiating ccRCC from non-ccRCC. There was no significant difference in diagnostic accuracy between PCT and DECT (p > 0.05). BV and iodine ratio were independent predictors of non-ccRCC (p < 0.05). However, the mean size-specific dose estimate was 16 times lower with DECT than with PCT (p < 0.001). The AUC of iodine ratio was 0.95, and sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy with an iodine ratio cutoff of 63.72% was 0.90, 0.86, and 0.87, respectively. CONCLUSION. PCT and DECT had comparable and high diagnostic accuracy in differentiating RCC subtypes; however, because of the significantly lower radiation dose of DECT, iodine ratio may be used as the best independent predictor.Copyright © American Roentgen Ray Society",Excluded
2854,"Monitoring of residual hematopoiesis after total body irradiation in humans as a model for accidental x-ray exposure: dose-effect and failure of ex vivo expansion of residual stem cells in view of autografting. PURPOSE: To evaluate the residual hematopoiesis at different levels of total body irradiation (TBI) dose in bone marrow (BM) and peripheral blood (PB), and to study the dose-effect relationship on hematopoietic immature and mature progenitors. We also investigated the possibility of expanding ex vivo the residual progenitors exposed to different dose levels of TBI., METHODS AND MATERIALS: Eight patients treated for AML (n = 3) and myeloma (n = 5) were included. BM and PB samples were harvested before TBI and after doses of: 5 Gy. Mononuclear cells (MNCs) were assayed for burst-forming unit erythroid (BFU-E), granulocyte-forming unit macrophage (CFU-GM), and long-term culture initiating cells (LTC-ICs). Ex vivo expansion: MNCs (after irradiation and controls) were suspended in long-term cultures and expanded with a combination of five cytokines., RESULTS: CD34+ cells were detectable at 10 Gy. We observed a significant decrease of CFU-GM and BFU-E, respectively, to 13.5% and 8.5% of baseline values for doses <or=2 Gy and to 8.2% and 4.6% for doses ranging between 2.1 and 5 Gy. No dose effect was observed for residual MNCs. LTC-ICs were not detectable after 0.8 Gy. The expansion was not successful after 1.2 Gy., CONCLUSION: This study confirms the significant decrease of human mature and immature progenitors in BM and PB immediately after low-dose TBI. In addition, the lack of expansion suggests that autografting using BM or PB residual stem cells collected and expanded in vitro in case of accidental whole body exposure may be impractical.",Excluded

OBJECTIVE: To report a new technique of modified percutaneous vertebroplasty (PVP) assisted by preoperative CT-based digital design for osteoporotic vertebral compression fracture (OVCF), and to discuss its preliminary clinical results., METHODS: Thoracolumbar spine segment data (Dicom format) were obtained from lamellar CT scanning of seven old female or male with single OVCF. A three-dimensional model of thoracolumbar spine and simulative PVP models (via double transpedicular approach) were built in the Mimics software. With the help of a preoperative transparent marker located at the back midline skin and preoperative digital design by Mimics software, the needle insert point and needle direction in every patient were established. The surgical time, the number of intraoperative radiation perspective, bone cement filling condition in fracture vertebra, intraoperative complications and visual analogue scale (VAS) scores before and after surgery were recorded to evaluate the preliminary clinical results after modified PVP., RESULTS: The puncture process during PVP was in high accordance with the preoperative digital design by Mimics software in seven cases of single OVCF with the average age of 78 years old. The operation time was only 16.57+/-2.07 minutes and the intraoperative radiation perspective numbers were less than ten (7.86+/-1.68) times. The bone cement filling in all fracture vertebras were good and no surgical complications such as spine cord injury and cement leakage were founded.

982,"A simplified approach to pulmonary vein visualization in cryo-balloon ablation of atrial fibrillation. Background: Pulmonary vein isolation (PVI) by cryo balloon (CB) ablation is an effective and effcient alternative to radio frequency ablation in patients with atrial fbrillation (AF). It requires less technical infrastructure (e.g. 3D mapping systems) and typically has a steeper learning curve. Selective, multiplanar pulmonary vein (PV) angiography (PVA) has been established as the gold standard for PV visualization in CB PVI. Objective(s): We aimed to simplify this approach to achieve a reduction of procedural complexity and radiation exposure Methods: Patients with paroxysmal or early persistent AF undergoing CB based PVI from Jan. 2015 to Dec. 2017 were retrospectively analyzed. Patients received conventional (PVA) or unselective left atrial angiography (LAA) for PV visualization. LAA was acquired by contrast injection in the AP projection. Also, in the LAA group the AP plane was maintained during the CB procedure, unless satisfactory PV occlusion could not be achieved. Result(s): 336 patients were analyzed (female n=127, 38%; age 62+/-0.6 years; BMI 27+/-0.2 kg/m2; LA volume 66+/-2.4 ml; EHRA 2.3+/-0.04; CHA2DS2-VASc 2.0+/-0.1). 87 patients (26%) received PVA and 249 (74%) LAA. No signifcant differences in clinical characteristics were observed. LAA required fewer PV visualization sequences (2.0+/-0.05 vs 2.0+/-0.05; p<0.0001), resulting in reduced procedure (93+/-1.79 vs 110.8+/-3.18 min; p<0.0001), as well as lower fuoroscopy time (14.2+/-0.43 vs 19+/-0.78 min; p<0.0001) and radiation dose (634.6+/-69.58 vs 1574+/-190.8 cGcm2; p<0.0001). There was a trend to lower contrast use (78.7+/-2.8 vs. 91.3+/-5.99 ml; p=0.0573). Markers of procedural quality (PV occlusion, CB temperature, time to isolation) showed no signifcant differences. Number of CB applications (1.4+/-0.02 vs. 1.6+/-0.05; p<0.0001) and total application time per vein (297.9+/-4.62 vs. 348.9+/-11.03 seconds; p<0.0001) were slightly but signifcantly higher in the PVA group. Minor complications were equally distributed between both groups. Only one major complication (stroke) was observed in the PVA group.

Thereafter, H/R-induced changes in mRNA and protein expression, inner mitochondrial membrane potential (DELTAPSI(m)), formation of superoxide, and cell death were compared between H/R-adapted and control PT cultures. As a result, H/R-adapted PT cells exhibited lower H/R-induced hyperpolarization of DELTAPSI(m) and produced less superoxide than the control cultures. Consequently, H/R triggered DELTAPSI(m) break-down and DNA degradation in a lower percentage of H/R-adapted than control PT cells. Moreover, H/R induced upregulation of mitochondrial uncoupling protein-3 (UCP-3) in H/R-adapted PT but not in control cultures. In addition, ionizing radiation killed a lower percentage of H/R-adapted as compared to control cells suggestive of an H/R-radiation cross-resistance developed by the selection procedure. Knockdown of UCP-3 decreased H/R- and radioresitance of the H/R-adapted cells. Finally, UCP-3 protein abundance of PT-derived clear cell renal cell carcinoma and normal renal tissue was compared in human specimens indicating upregulation of UCP-3 during tumor development. Combined, our data suggest functional significance of UCP-3 for H/R resistance.",Excluded
2251,"Investigative strategies for fish bone foreign bodies during the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic: An analysis of ENT UK guidelines. Abstract Background By nature of their specialty, otolaryngologists are disproportionately exposed to coronavirus disease 2019 through aerosol-generating procedures and close proximity to the oropharynx during examination. Methods Our single-centre, retrospective study analysed the pertinence of guidelines produced by ENT UK to improve the investigation and management of suspected upper aerodigestive fish bone foreign bodies during the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic. Results Our results demonstrated 43.3 per cent (n = 13) low-risk cases and 56.7 per cent (n = 17) moderate-risk cases. Nine fish bones (two low risk, seven moderate risk) were found; none of these were confirmed with X-ray and three (moderate risk) required nasoendoscopy for diagnosis. One patient required rigid pharyngoscopy. Conclusion This study confirms that soft tissue neck X-ray and flexible nasoendoscopy are unnecessary in low-risk cases; however, early nasoendoscopy in higher suspicion cases is appropriate. Recommendations are made about the long-term sustainability of these guidelines, and additional measures are encouraged that relate to repeat attendances and varying prevalence of coronavirus disease 2019 in the hospital catchment area.Copyright © The Author(s), 2021.

134,"Boron neutron capture therapy combined with early successive bevacizumab treatments for recurrent malignant gliomas - A pilot study. Recurrent malignant gliomas (RMGs) are difficult to control, and no standard protocol has been established for their treatment. At our institute, we have often treated RMGs by tumor-selective particle radiation called boron neutron capture therapy (BNCT). However, despite the cell-selectivity of BNCT, brain radiation necrosis (BRN) may develop and cause severe neurological complications and sometimes death. This is partly due to the full-dose X-ray treatments usually given earlier in the treatment course. To overcome BRN following BNCT, recent studies have used bevacizumab (BV). We herein used extended BV treatment beginning just after BNCT to confer protection against or ameliorate BRN, and evaluated; the feasibility, efficacy, and BRN control of this combination treatment. Seven patients with RMGs (grade 3 and 4 cases) were treated with BNCT between June 2013 and May 2014, followed by successive BV treatments. They were followed-up to December 2017. Median overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) after combination treatment were 15.1 and 5.4 months, respectively. In one case, uncontrollable brain edema occurred and ultimately led to death after BV was interrupted due to meningitis. In two other cases, symptomatic aggravation of BRN occurred after interruption of BV treatment. No BRN was observed during the observation period in the other cases. Common terminology criteria for adverse events grade 2 and 3 proteinuria occurred in two cases and necessitated the interruption of BV treatments. Boron neutron capture therapy followed by BV treatments well-prevented or well-controlled BRN with prolonged OS and acceptable incidence of adverse events in our patients with RMG.Copyright © 2018 by The Japan Neurosurgical Society.",Excluded

231,"Residential radon exposure and esophageal cancer. An ecological study from an area with high indoor radon concentration (Galicia, Spain). PURPOSE: To analyze the correlation between municipal esophageal cancer relative risk and municipal residential radon concentration in a high radon emission Spanish area., MATERIALS AND METHODS: We performed an ecological study at municipal level in Galicia, Spain. For each municipality we estimated the median radon concentration and the relative risk (RR) for esophageal cancer mortality for males and females. The relative risk was calculated using a Bayesian approach. Homes with data on radon concentration were selected through stratified random sampling. To be included, each municipality had to have at least five radon measurements. We obtained Spearman's correlations for median residential radon concentration and esophageal cancer mortality RR for males and females, separately., RESULTS: We included 129 municipalities, covering the 79% of Galician population. 14% of municipalities had radon concentrations above the United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) action level. We found a statistically significant correlation among residential radon and esophageal cancer mortality RR for males (p < 0.001), but not for females. When the analysis was restricted to municipalities with more than 15 radon measurements the correlation pattern remained., CONCLUSIONS: This is the first study analyzing the association between residential radon and esophageal cancer. The results suggesting a possible effect of residential radon on esophageal cancer mortality should be explored through more robust epidemiological designs such as case-control studies.",Excluded
3579,"Is the paradise in the Caribbean? Prevalence of hypovitaminosis D in HIV+ patients treated at a clinic in Puerto Rico. Background: Existent studies have demonstrated that HIV+ population suffer from low bone density, increasing their risk of fractures, which has been linked to the use of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) and even HIV itself. Currently, there aren't studies published regarding vitamin D deficiency and insufficiency in HIV+ patients in the Caribbean (latitude 18degree00N 66degree37W). Our hypothesis is that HIV+ patients with or without HAART who live in the Caribbean have 25-hydroxyvitamin D severe deficiency (<=25 nmol/l), deficiency (<=50 nmol/l) or insufficiency (>50 nmol/l <=75 nmol/l). Methodology: A retrospective chart review was conducted among files from HIV+ adults >49 year managed at private clinic. A data collection tool was designed to gather demographic characteristics (age, gender, race/ethnicity), vitamin D levels, height, weight, body mass index (BMI), viral load, CD4 cell count, 25-OHD levels, time with HIV infection (date of diagnosis), AIDS defining illness, current or former IVDU, tobacco use, current ARV therapy (PI or NNRTI based), time on ARV (number of years since first ARV regimen), co-morbid conditions, multivitamin use, vitamin D supplementation used and dose, and other medications. Result(s): All patients were Hispanic, 62.8% men, and mean age was 57 years. Twenty-two patients (51%) had deficient/insufficient vitamin D levels vs 21 patients (49%) who had normal vitamin D levels. Among patients with vitamin D deficiency/insufficiency, 95.5% were taking ART; 68% were on a PI based regimen, and 32% on a non-PI based regimen. Eighteen patients (82%) with deficient/insufficient vitamin D levels had a BMI<30 vs 4 patients (18%) with a BMI>30. Ten patients (46%) with deficient/insufficient levels had a total daily intake of <=800 IU of vitamin D vs 6 patients (27%) which were taking a total daily intake of >800 IU of vitamin D; 6 (27%) patients with deficient/ insufficient levels were not taking any vitamin D supplementation. Four patients (18%) with deficiency/ insufficiency were currently smokers. Fifteen patients (68%) with deficiency/insufficiency had been infected for 1-10 years, 7 patients (32%) had been infected for more than 11 years. Conclusion(s): Inadequate vitamin D levels were highly prevalent among HIV+ patients treated at a clinic in the Caribbean. Although, location of the population is in the Caribbean, were there is no difference in the solar radiation between seasons, less than 50% of the HIV population had the sufficient vitamin D levels. Even in patients using more than 400 IU of vitamin D level per day, more than 50% of them had inadequate vitamin D levels. Additional studies in this area are needed to determine the necessary amount of vitamin D for the HIV infected patients to maintain sufficient vitamin D levels.",Excluded
3457,"A novel combination of percutaneous stenting with iodine-125 seed implantation and chemotherapy for the treatment of pancreatic head cancer with obstructive jaundice. Purpose: Insertion of radioactive strips through the biliary stent has been reported to offer longer survival and patency than an uncovered conventional self-expanding metal stent in patients with unresectable malignant biliary obstruction. The aim of this study was to investigate the safety and effectiveness of intraluminal brachytherapy combined with 125I seed implantation and transarterial infusion chemotherapy for the treatment of pancreatic head cancer with obstructive jaundice. Method(s): From October 2012 to January 2018, 21 consecutive patients diagnosed with biliary obstruction caused by locally advanced, nonmetastatic pancreatic cancer with cytologically or histologically confirmed by biopsy were enrolled and receive treatment with intraluminal brachytherapy using 125I seed strand and CT-guided percutaneous radioactive seed implantation therapy. The procedure-related and radiation complications were assessed. The outcomes were measured in terms of stent patency, patient survival, complications related to the procedure. Result(s): One of the 22 patients (4.5%, 1/22) with pancreatic head cancer failed to perform the above procedure because the guidewire was unable to pass through the obstruction segment. The remaining 21 patients (95.5%, 21/22) with pancreatic head cancer with obstructive jaundice were successfully placed with biliary stents and radioactive strips through drainage tubes. The median number of 125I seeds loaded was 15, ranging from 12 to 17. After the chemotherapy with gemcitabine and cisplatin, no adverse reaction of Grade III ~ occurred in all cases. Median stent patency was 12.50 months (95% CI: 10.26, 14.74). By May 2019, all 21 patients had died, with overall survival of 5.2-23.3 months, with a median survival of 13.20 months (95% CI: 10.96, 15.44). Conclusion(s): Percutaneous 125I seed implantation combined with insertion of radioactive strips through the biliary stent has the characteristics of less trauma, fewer complications, simple operation, and so on. These procedures bring remission of obstructive jaundice combined with the increased survival for the treatment of obstructive jaundice caused by unresectable pancreatic head cancer if follow-up chemotherapy is carried out. The long-term efficacy of this treatment combination needs to be confirmed by further multicenter, large sample size prospective randomized controlled studies.Copyright © 2021 American Brachytherapy Society",Excluded
2677,"Does tributyl phosphate influence the radiation risk of a highly proliferating system--the early mouse embryo in vitro?. Two-cell mouse embryos were exposed in vitro to tributyl phosphate, x rays, or a combination of both. In-vitro development of the embryos was followed microscopically (cleavage to four- and eight-cell embryos, formation of morulae and blastocysts, and hatching of blastocysts). Effects on proliferation were estimated by counting the number of cells per embryo early (48 h p.c. = 48 hours post conceptionem) and late (144 h p.c.) in the preimplantation period. Cytogenetic damage was studied using micronucleus formation as the end point. Tributyl phosphate did not reveal toxic effects up to a concentration of about 5 microM after an exposure time of 18 h. At a concentration of about 15 microM, 50% of late preimplantation embryos showed effects on morphological development and on cell proliferation, and at about 40 microM, 90% of the embryos were affected. Tributyl phosphate did not induce micronuclei. Small effects by x irradiation were observed between 0.25 Gy and 0.5 Gy, depending on the end point measured in the late preimplantation stage. Fifty percent of the embryos were affected by a dose slightly higher than 1 Gy, and 90% after about 4 Gy. No enhancement in risk was found after combined treatment of the embryos with tributyl phosphate and x rays.",Excluded
2089,"Dissecting the hematopoietic microenvironment. V: limitations of repair following damage to the hematopoietic support stroma. Damage and repair of the hematopoietic microenvironment of the spleen was studied using X-irradiation, anoxic necrosis induced by splenic ligation, or a combination of the two, as the destructive agents. Spleen colony number, size and type, 59Fe uptake, and microscopic study of splenic structure were used as means of assessment. The most severe or least repaired damage was induced by high dose irradiation (4000 r), by 1000 r followed immediately by splenic ligation, and by two successive splenic ligations separated by a 30 day recovery period. It was seen that reduction of CFUs lodgment, as measured by f factor, played a very major role in the lesser number of spleen colonies formed after either kind of damage. Following the several treatments, the numbers of spleen colonies formed, their size and their typing as erythrocytic or granulocytic varied independently of each other, suggesting that these functions of the microenvironment, and the cell types responsible for them, are independent of each other. The exhaustion of regenerative capacity displayed by repeatedly ligated spleens suggested a maximal limit for stromal cell replications commensurate with Hayflick's hypothesis.",Excluded

Background/Aim: A retrospective study was conducted to evaluate the safety and efficacy of stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) for pulmonary oligometastasis from colorectal cancer (CRC). Patients and Methods: Patients with pulmonary oligometastasis from CRC who were treated with SBRT between April 2010 and October 2018 were enrolled in this study. All patients underwent SBRT using Cyberknife with a dose of 54-60 Gy in 3 fractions to 99% of the clinical target volume. The treatment efficacy was evaluated by the local control (LC) and overall survival (OS) rates. The toxicity was evaluated using the National Cancer Institute's Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events version 4.0. Result(s): Twenty-six lesions in 20 patients were treated with SBRT. The median followup duration was 19 months (range=6-98 months). Local recurrence occurred in 6 of 26 lesions with a median followup of 12 months. The 2-year LC and OS rates were 65.8% and 88.6%, respectively. No patient developed = grade 2 toxicity in the lung and other sites. Conclusion(s): Although very high doses were delivered to the tumors with SBRT, the LC of pulmonary metastasis from CRC was not satisfactory when compared to that for stage I primary non-small cell lung cancer reported in the literature.Copyright © 2020 International Institute of Anticancer Research.

2157,"Lung cancer in never smokers. Lung cancer is predominantly associated with cigarette smoking; however, a substantial minority of patients with the disease have never smoked. In the US it is estimated there are 17,000-26,000 annual deaths from lung cancer innever smokers, which as a separate entity would be the seventh leading cause of cancer mortality. Controversy surrounds the question of whether or not the incidence of lung cancer in never-smokers is increasing, with more data to support this observation in Asia. There are several factors associated with an increased risk of developing lung cancer in never smokers including second hand smoke, indoor air pollution, occupational exposures, and genetic susceptibility among others. Adenocarcinoma is the most common histology of lung cancer in never smokers and in comparison to lung cancer in smokers appears less complex with a higher likelihood to have targetable driver mutations.Copyright © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2016.",Excluded

1665,"Developing a cancer-specific trigger tool to identify treatment-related adverse events using administrative data. BACKGROUND: As there are few validated tools to identify treatment-related adverse events across cancer care settings, we sought to develop oncology-specific ""triggers"" to flag potential adverse events among cancer patients using claims data., METHODS: 322 887 adult patients undergoing an initial course of cancer-directed therapy for breast, colorectal, lung, or prostate cancer from 2008 to 2014 were drawn from a large commercial claims database. We defined 16 oncology-specific triggers using diagnosis and procedure codes. To distinguish treatment-related complications from comorbidities, we required a logical and temporal relationship between a treatment and the associated trigger. We tabulated the prevalence of triggers by cancer type and metastatic status during 1-year of follow-up, and examined cancer trigger risk factors., RESULTS: Cancer-specific trigger events affected 19% of patients over the initial treatment year. The trigger burden varied by disease and metastatic status, from 6% of patients with nonmetastatic prostate cancer to 41% and 50% of those with metastatic colorectal and lung cancers, respectively. The most prevalent triggers were abnormal serum bicarbonate, blood transfusion, non-contrast chest CT scan following radiation therapy, and hypoxemia. Among patients with metastatic disease, 10% had one trigger event and 29% had two or more. Triggers were more common among older patients, women, non-whites, patients with low family incomes, and those without a college education., CONCLUSIONS: Oncology-specific triggers offer a promising method for identifying potential patient safety events among patients across cancer care settings.

Objectives: The aim of this study was to study differences in progression of aortic stenosis (AS) in patients with mediastinal radiotherapy (XRT)-associated moderate AS versus a matched cohort during the same time frame, and to ascertain need for aortic valve replacement (AVR) and longer-term survival. Background(s): Rate of progression of XRT-associated moderate AS and its impact on outcomes is not well-described. Method(s): We included 81 patients (age 61 +/- 13 years; 57% female) with at least XRT-associated moderate AS (aortic valve area [AVA] 1.05 +/- 0.3 cm2; mean gradient 24 +/- 10 mm Hg) who had >=2 transthoracic echocardiograms (TTEs) 1 year apart and matched them in a 1:2 fashion on the basis of age, sex, and AVA with those without prior XRT. Serial aortic valve gradients and AVA were recorded. AVR and longer-term all-cause mortality during follow-up were recorded. Result(s): A total of 100% of patients had 1, a total of 71% had 2, and 39% had 3 follow-up TTEs. Before AVR, mean AVG and AVA were not significantly different between XRT and comparison groups. At 3.6 +/- 2.0 years from baseline TTE, 146 (60%) underwent AVR (16% transcatheter), with significantly more patients in the XRT group undergoing AVR (80% vs. 50%; p < 0.01), at a much shorter time (2.9 +/- 1.6 years vs. 4.1 +/- 2.4 years; p < 0.01). At 6.6 +/- 4.0 years from the initial TTE, 49 (20%) patients died, with a significantly higher mortality in the XRT group (40% vs. 11%; p < 0.01), with prior XRT associated with increased longer-term mortality, whereas AVR was associated with improved longer-term survival. Conclusion(s): In patients with moderate AS, those with prior XRT have a similar rate of progression of AS versus a comparison group. A higher proportion of patients in the XRT group were referred for AVR at a shorter time from baseline TTE. Despite that, the XRT patients had significantly higher longer-term mortality, and prior exposure to XRT was associated with significantly increased longer-term mortality.Copyright © 2018 American College of Cardiology Foundation",Excluded
1109,"Prognostic value of metabolic tumor volume as measured by fluorine-18-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography/computed tomography in nasopharyngeal carcinoma. Background: The prognostic value of the tumor burden characterized by the metabolic tumor volume (MTV) remains under investigation in nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC). The purpose of this study was to evaluate the prognostic value of the maximum standardized uptake value (SUVmax) and MTV according to metabolic volume threshold as measured by positron emission tomography (PET)/computed tomography (CT), and other clinical factors, in patients with NPC. Method(s): This study was a retrospective chart review. We evaluated the association of SUVmax, MTV2.5, MTV3.0, and other clinical factors with overall survival (OS) using Kaplan-Meier and Cox regression models. (MTV2.5 and MTV3.0 are the volume of hypermetabolic tissue within the regions of gross tumor volumes with a SUV value greater than the threshold values of 2.5 and 3.0, respectively.) Results: Higher MTV2.5 of 31.45 cm3 and MTV3.0 of 23.01 cm3 were associated with an increased risk of death (hazard ratio [HR] = 5.028; p = 0.029), although no significant relationship was found between SUVmax and OS. Interestingly, MTV3.0 was associated with OS in both the differentiated and undifferentiated groups, although MTV2.5 was only associated with OS in the undifferentiated group. Among the clinical parameters, only radiotherapy was associated with longer OS (HR = 12.124; p < 0.001). Conclusion(s): The MTV and radiotherapy could be prognostic values associated with OS. Particularly, MTV2.5 and MTV3.0 might be valuable metabolic parameters for predicting long-term survival in patients with NPC. Furthermore, MTV3.0 may be more useful because it can be applied irrespective of pathologic subtype.Copyright © 2014 ARS-AAOA, LLC.",Excluded
2347,"Photocontact dermatitis from ketoprofen and tiaprofenic acid: Cross-reactivity study in 12 consecutive patients. The arylpropionic acid derivatives (APADs) ketoprofen and tiaprofenic acid can provoke photoallergic dermatitis. Possible cross-reactivity between APADs is of importance in patients using nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. Because of the similarities in chemical structures, we investigated patients with photoallergy to ketoprofen or tiaprofenic acid, in order to study cross-reactivity between APADs and a possible pattern of cross-reactivity between benzophenone-containing molecules, so as to determine the molecular basis of photoallergy to ketoprofen or tiaprofenic acid. 10 patients with photoallergy to topical ketoprofen, 2 with photoallergy to oral tiaprofenic acid, and 15 control subjects with no history of contact dermatitis from APADs, nor from benzophenone-containing molecules, were photopatch tested in triplicate with ketoprofen, tiaprofenic acid, other APADs (alminoprofen, fenoprofen, flurbiprofen, ibuprofen and naproxen), benzophenone-containing molecules (fenofibrate, oxybenzone, sulisobenzone), and unsubstituted benzophenone. 1 set was irradiated with UVA light, 1 with solar-simulated irradiation and 1 dark control. Tests were read at 2, 3 and 4 days. Patients reacted to both ketoprofen and tiaprofenic acid (12/12), fenofibrate (8/12), oxybenzone (3/12) and unsubstituted benzophenone (11/12), but not to other APADs, nor to sulisobenzone. Tests remained negative in control patients. Photoallergy is due to the benzophenone moiety of ketoprofen, or to the very similar thiophene-phenylketone of tiaprofenic acid, but not to their arylpropionic function. This induces cross-reactivity to fenofibrate and oxybenzone but not to APADs without a benzophenone moiety, which may therefore probably be used in such patients. Unsubstituted benzophenone should be added to standard phototesting series.",Excluded
1297,"Effectiveness of using low-dose computed tomography to assess patency in gastrointestinal tracts with a patency capsule. BACKGROUND/AIMS: A patency capsule (PC) is used to safely perform capsule endoscopy. When the PC is not excreted within the defined time frame, radiography often cannot localize the PC. Computed tomography (CT) localizes a PC more definitively than radiography. We evaluated the localization of PCs using low-dose (LD)-CT., METHODOLOGY: Forty-nine patients received a PC and 33 did not excrete the PC within the defined time frame and underwent radiography and LDCT with a 90% exposure reduction., RESULTS: LDCT localized the PC in 31 patients (93.9%), whereas radiography localized it in 7 (21.2%), indicating a significantly higher detection rate with LDCT (P<0.0001). PC retention in the small intestine was confirmed by LDCT in 4 patients. Retention was not observed during capsule endoscopy in the patients with confirmed patency of the gastrointestinal tract. In 21 patients who underwent LDCT with the conventional photographing area, the effective radiographic exposure dose associated with LDCT was 1.43+/-1.08 mSv. Conversely, in the 12 patients who underwent LDCT with a reduced photographing area, the effective dose was reduced to 0.62+/-0.27 mSv (P<0.05)., CONCLUSION: LDCT with a reduced exposure dose can definitively localize a PC.

According to statistics in 2010, 85% of lung cancer in men and 57% in women are attributed to tobacco smoking. The aim of the study was to describe the clinical and pathologic characteristics of the female patients who visited the Department of Medical Oncology of Acibadem Maslak Hospital between 2009 and 2017. Material(s) and Method(s): Clinicopathologic data collected for analyses included age at diagnosis, history of cigarette use, comorbid conditions, family history, tumor-node-metastasis stage, pathologic subtypes of lung carcinoma, and the given therapy. From July 2017 to February 2018, we collected data of 540 female patients with lung cancer at the Department of Medical Oncology of Acibadem Maslak Hospital. Result(s): Among 540 patients, 185 patients (34.3%) were nonsmokers, 106 (19.6%) were current smokers, and 210 (38.9%) were former smokers. Data on common comorbid conditions such as hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and coronary artery disease were collected, and the conditions were classified according to the smoking status of the patients. Among current and former smokers, 36.7% were diagnosed with hypertension, 18.3% with diabetes mellitus, and 11% with coronary artery diseases. Moreover, 75% of all patients were diagnosed with nonsmall-cell lung cancer (NSCLC), whereas 16% were diagnosed with small-cell lung cancer. Adenocarcinoma is the most common histological type of cancer seen in patients with NSCLC (77%), followed by patients with squamous cell carcinoma (15%). Conclusion(s): Factors other than tobacco use, such as radon exposure, air pollution, radiation exposure, and an unbalanced diet are responsible for the increasing incidence of lung cancer. However, further studies are warranted to investigate the cause of the epidemic differences in women, particularly the gender bias in nonsmoker patients with lung cancer.Copyright © 2020 by Turkish Society of Medical Oncology.",Excluded
927,"Outcomes of medium choroidal melanomas treated with ruthenium brachytherapy guided by three-dimensional pretreatment modeling. PURPOSE: The Collaborative Ocular Melanoma Study (COMS) established iodine-125 (I-125) plaque brachytherapy for eye preserving treatment of medium-sized choroidal melanomas in the United States. Eye Physics I-125 plaque treatment modeled with Plaque Simulator (PS) software yields similar results to COMS. Herein, we report results from a series of 15 patients treated with ruthenium-106 (Ru-106) plaque brachytherapy using PS pretreatment modeling for plaque localization and dosimetry., METHODS AND MATERIALS: Fifteen patients with medium-sized choroidal melanomas (2.84-5.5 mm in apical height and a basal diameter of 7.8-12.6 mm) treated with ruthenium brachytherapy from 2003 to 2005 were evaluated retrospectively. Baseline and followup data were evaluated for tumor height, best corrected visual acuity, radiation retinopathy, radiation optic neuropathy, postradiation cataract formation, diplopia, and ptosis. Tumor response for both Ru-106 and I-125 plaques planned using the same PS pretreatment modeling was evaluated and compared., RESULTS: Isotope-specific radiation profiles were compared, and rates of local treatment failure (0%), optic neuropathy (6.7%), retinopathy (20%), and cataracts (33%) were evaluated. Five year-treated tumor heights were approximately 0.61 +/- 0.29 (I-125, n = 16) and 0.53 +/- 0.17 (Ru-106, n = 6) of their heights at diagnosis., CONCLUSIONS: This patient subset had background characteristics very similar to those of the COMS and patients treated at our institution with I-125 plaques. Treatment response was equivalent although radiation complications occurred slightly less frequently in the Ru-106 group compared with those treated with I-125. Image-guided three-dimensional pretreatment modeling for plaque localization and dosimetry seems to work equally as well for Ru as for I-125 plaques and justifies more extensive investigation.

Aims: The emerging role of coronary computed tomography angiography (CCTA) as a non-invasive tool for atherosclerosis evaluation is supported by data reporting a good correlation between CCTA and intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) for plaque volume quantification. Aim of the present study was to evaluate whether a last generation CT-scanner may improve coronary plaque volume assessment using IVUS as standard-of-reference. Methods and Results: From a registry of 1915 consecutive, all-comers, patients who underwent a clinically indicated IVUS evaluation we enrolled 59 patients who underwent CCTA with a 64-slice CT (Group 1) and 59 patients who underwent CCTA with whole-heart coverage CT scanner (Group 2). Patients who underwent CCTA with unfavourable heart rhythm were not excluded from the analysis. Image quality (4-point Likert scale) focused on plaque analysis was evaluated. Plaque volume quantification by CCTA was compared to IVUS. No difference in clinical characteristics was found between Group 1 and Group 2. Plaque volume quantification by CCTA was considered not feasible in 11 plaques of Group 1 and in 4 plaques of Group 2 (P = 0.09). Higher correlation for plaque volume quantification by CCTA vs. IVUS was demonstrated in Group 2 when compared with Group 1 (r = 0.9888 vs. 0.9499; P < 0.0001). The Bland-Altman analysis showed plaque volume overestimation by CCTA of 11.9 mm3 in Group 1 and 4 mm2 in Group 2 (P < 0.001). Effective radiation dose of CCTA was significantly lower in Group 2 vs. Group 1 (2.7 +/- 0.9 vs. 8.1 +/- 3.6 mSv, respectively; P < 0.001). Conclusion(s): CCTA using a new scanner generation showed to be an accurate non-invasive tool to assess and quantify coronary plaque volume.Copyright © 2019 Published on behalf of the European Society of Cardiology.

2589,"Assessment of ocular exposure to ultraviolet-B for population studies. Salisbury Eye Evaluation Project Team. We have developed an empirical model with which to estimate the ocular exposure in the UVB wavelength band. This model incorporates aspects of personal behavior, geographic location, season and wavelength that have been developed from population-based data. This model, in conjunction with job history interviews, allows the estimate of cumulative exposures from age 30 in our population-based study. We present data on average annual exposure by age, gender, race, education and reported photophobia. The exposures in the general population are considerably lower than exposures reported in previous works based on occupational groups. There is a statistically significant difference between males and females, with females having lower exposures. African-Americans have median exposures similar to whites. Exposures decrease with education and with reported photophobia. These data provide the basis for characterizing lifetime exposure for the general population. The variability of exposure is much greater than found in occupational groups and includes numbers in the lowest exposure. The model should permit determination of a dose-response relationship with eye disease, even to the lower dose ranges.",Excluded
1460,"Phase 2 study of preoperative image-guided intensity-modulated radiation therapy to reduce wound and combined modality morbidities in lower extremity soft tissue sarcoma. BACKGROUND: This study sought to determine if preoperative image-guided intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IG-IMRT) can reduce morbidity, including wound complications, by minimizing dose to uninvolved tissues in adults with lower extremity soft tissue sarcoma. METHOD(S): The primary endpoint was the development of an acute wound complication (WC). IG-IMRT was used to conform volumes to avoid normal tissues (skin flaps for wound closure, bone, or other uninvolved soft tissues). From July 2005 to June 2009, 70 adults were enrolled; 59 were evaluable for the primary endpoint. Median tumor size was 9.5 cm; 55 tumors (93%) were high-grade and 58 (98%) were deep to fascia. RESULT(S): Eighteen (30.5%) patients developed WCs. This was not statistically significantly different from the result of the National Cancer Institute of Canada SR2 trial (P =.2); however, primary closure technique was possible more often (55 of 59 patients [93.2%] versus 50 of 70 patients [71.4%]; P =.002), and secondary operations for WCs were somewhat reduced (6 of 18 patients [33%] versus 13 of 30 patients [43%]; P =.55). Moderate edema, skin, subcutaneous, and joint toxicity was present in 6 (11.1%), 1 (1.9%), 5 (9.3%), and 3 (5.6%) patients, respectively, but there were no bone fractures. Four local recurrences (6.8%, none near the flaps) occurred with median follow-up of 49 months. CONCLUSION(S): The 30.5% incidence of WCs was numerically lower than the 43% risk derived from the National Cancer Institute of Canada SR2 trial, but did not reach statistical significance. Preoperative IG-IMRT significantly diminished the need for tissue transfer. RT chronic morbidities and the need for subsequent secondary operations for WCs were lowered, although not significantly, whereas good limb function was maintained.

2222,"A novel aldehyde dehydrogenase-3 activator (Alda-89) protects submandibular gland function from irradiation without accelerating tumor growth. Purpose: To determine the effect of Alda-89 (an ALDH3 activitor) on (i) the function of irradiated (radiotherapy) submandibular gland (SMG) in mice, (ii) its toxicity profile, and (iii) its effect on the growth of head and neck cancer (HNC) in vitro and in vivo. Experimental Design: Adult mice were infused with Alda-89 or vehicle before, during, and after radiotherapy. Saliva secretion was monitored weekly. Hematology, metabolic profile, and postmortem evaluation for toxicity were examined at the time of sacrifice. Alda-89 or vehicle was applied toHNCcell lines in vitro, and severe combined immunodeficient (SCID) mice transplanted with HNC in vivo with or without radiation; HNC growth was monitored. The ALDH3A1 and ALDH3A2 protein expression was evaluated in 89 patients with HNC and correlated to freedom from relapse (FFR) and overall survival (OS). Result(s): Alda-89 infusion significantly resulted in more whole saliva production and a higher percentage of preserved acini after radiotherapy compared with vehicle control. There was no difference in the complete blood count, metabolic profile, and major organ morphology between the Alda-89 and vehicle groups. Compared with vehicle control, Alda-89 treatment neither accelerated HNC cell proliferation in vitro, nor did it affect tumor growth in vivo with or without radiotherapy. Higher expression of ALDH3A1 orALDH3A2 was not significantly associated with worse FFR or OS in either human papillomavirus (HPV)-positive or HPV-negative group. Conclusion(s): Alda-89 preserves salivary function after radiotherapy without affecting HNC growth or causing measurable toxicity in mice. It is a promising candidate to mitigate radiotherapy-related xerostomia. © 2013 American Association for Cancer Research.",Excluded

2747,"A randomized double-blind controlled trial: Impact of probiotics on diarrhea in patients treated with pelvic radiation. Background & aims: Radical radiation therapy is commonly used for treatment of pelvic cancer. Up to 80% of patients receiving radiotherapy will develop acute radiation induced diarrhea. The primary aim of this randomized double blind controlled trial is to evaluate the effect of the probiotic Bifilact on moderate and severe treatment-induced diarrhea during pelvic radiation. Method(s): Patients with pelvic cancers were treated between 2006 and 2010 at L'HOtel-Dieu de Quebec, University Health Center. Some patients had surgery before pelvic radiotherapy and some received chemotherapy. A total of 246 Patients were randomized between a placebo and either of two regiments of double strain Bifilact probiotics (Lactobacillus acidophilus LAC-361 and Bifidobacterium longum BB-536): a standard dose twice a day (1.3 billion CFU) or a high dose three times a day (10 billion CFU). Patients were trained to record their digestive symptoms daily with a standardized scale and they met a registered dietician and radiation oncologist every week during treatment. The main analysis compared time to first appearance of grade >=2-3-4 diarrhea using Kaplan-Meier curves as measured by proportion of patients without moderate and severe diarrhea. Result(s): 229 patients were analyzed. The difference between the groups for overall grade 2-3-4 diarrhea was not statistically significant (p=0.13). However at 60 days, the proportion of patients without moderate and severe diarrhea in the standard dose group (35%) was more than twice as high as that of the placebo group (17%) with a hazard ratio of 0.69 (p=0.04). In patients who had surgery, the standard probiotics dose group had a better proportion of patients without very severe diarrhea than the placebo group, respectively 97% and 74% (p=0.03). In all groups, the average number of bowel movements per day during treatment was less than 3 soft stools (p=0.80) and the median abdominal pain less than 1 based on the National Cancer Institute scale (p=0.23). Conclusion(s): Standard dose of Bifilact may reduce radiation induced grade 2-3-4 diarrhea at the end of the treatment of patients with pelvic cancer. In patients operated on before RT, a standard dose of probiotics may reduce radiation induced grade 4 diarrhea. Nutritional interventions by a registered dietician seemed to reduce global digestive symptoms. Trial Registration: clinicaltrials.gov.

556,"Light panretinal photocoagulation (LPRP) versus classic panretinal photocoagulation (CPRP) in proliferative diabetic retinopathy. PURPOSE: We misled to verify whether a panretinal photocoagulation (PRP) performed using low levels of ARGON laser energy (light PRP) has the same efficacy as a PRP performed in a conventional fashion using argon green wavelengths (classic PRP) in eyes with high-risk proliferative diabetic retinopathy (HRPDR). Furthermore, we misled to compare the session number performed and the side effects produced by the two techniques., METHODS: Sixty-five eyes with HRPDR of 50 consecutive patients were enrolled in a prospective randomized controlled trial. In eyes selected for light PRP, a very light biomicroscopic effect on the retina was obtained for each spot. In eyes assigned to classic PRP, each spot produced a white-yellow biomicroscopic effect. Mean follow-up was 22.4 months +/- 9.7 in the light PRP and 21.6 months +/- 9.3 in the classic PRP group (p = 0.727)., RESULTS: The initial mean logMAR visual acuity (VA) in the light PRP group was 0.12 +/- 0.13 and in the classic PRP group 0.14 +/- 0.15 (p = 0.493). The final mean VA in the former was 0.18 +/- 0.25, and in the latter 0.27 +/- 0.30 (p = 0.231). Median power was 235mW (100-540mW) for light and 420mW (200-950mW) for classic PRP (p < 0.001). Regression of HRPDR at the end of the follow-up was obtained in 30/31 eyes (97%) treated with classic PRP and in 31/34 eyes (91%) treated with light PRP (p = 0.615). The total mean session number was 7.4 +/- 2.4 for light and 9.9 +/- 2.2 for the classic PRP group (p < 0.001). Complications were more frequent in the classic PRP group., CONCLUSIONS: The efficacy of Light PRP is similar to that of classic Light PRP in eyes with HRPDR. Light PRP is associated with fewer complications and allows the reduction of the number of treatment sessions.",Excluded
2360,"Detrimental effects of electron beam irradiation on the cowpea bruchid Callosobruchus maculatus. BACKGROUND: Electron beam (eBeam) irradiation technology is an environmentally friendly, chemical-free alternative for disinfesting insect pests of stored grains. The underlying hypothesis is that specific doses of eBeam will have defined detrimental effects on the different life stages. We evaluated the effects of eBeam exposure in a range of doses (0.03-0.12 kGy) on the development of the cowpea bruchid (Callosobruchus maculatus) at various stages of its life cycle., RESULTS: Differential radiosensitivity was detected during egg development. Early and intermediate stages of eggs never hatched after exposure to a dose of 0.03 kGy, whereas a substantial portion of black-headed (i.e. late) eggs survived irradiation even at 0.12 kGy. However, further development of the hatched larvae was inhibited. Although midgut protein digestion remained intact, irradiated larvae (0.06 kGy or higher) failed to develop into normal living adults; rather, they died as pupae or abnormally eclosed adults, suggesting a detrimental effect of eBeam on metamorphosis. Emerged irradiated pupae had shorter longevity and were unable to produce any eggs at 0.06 kGy or higher. At this dose range, eggs laid by irradiated adults were not viable. eBeam treatment shortened adult longevity in a dose-dependent manner. Reciprocal crosses indicated that females were more sensitive to eBeam exposure than their male counterparts. Dissection of the female reproductive system revealed that eBeam treatment prevented formation of oocytes., CONCLUSION: eBeam irradiation has very defined effects on cowpea bruchid development and reproduction. A dose of 0.06 kGy could successfully impede cowpea burchid population expansion. This information can be exploited for post-harvest insect control of stored grains.

3539,"An application of visible human database in radiotherapy: Tutorial for image guided external radiotherapy (TIGER). Background and purpose Three-dimensional conformal radiotherapy and intensity modulated radiotherapy allow accurate dose delivery on target volumes. Due to the different background among specialists involved in target volume definition, the contouring emerges as one of the most questionable steps in treatment planning procedures. A software tool devoted to contouring training, named tutorial for image guided external radiotherapy ('TIGER'), based on the Visible Human Project images data-set, is described. Materials and methods TIGER is addressed to facilitate the learning of axial anatomical images, to promote the training and reproducibility in contouring process, to allow the availability of a tool to enhance the 'drill and practice' approach in training programs. TIGER includes three different environments: Anatomic tutorial devoted to facilitate a self-learning approach to axial body sections; Contouring tutorial addressed to practice contouring process of anatomical structures and to undergo a test program prepared by tutors; Teacher's tools to offer to tutors the opportunity to insert new outlines in TIGER-database, according to local needs or conventions, and to use them in tutorial programs. TIGER-database is grouped in six main anatomical sections: head and neck, male thorax, female thorax, abdomen, male pelvis, and female pelvis. Overall 432 corresponding CT-VH images and 1189 contours of 134 different anatomical structures and lymphatic drainage areas are available. The access to the TIGER software is allowed by ESTRO web site (http://www.estro.be). Conclusions TIGER provides an interactive human anatomy cross-sectional oriented source to facilitate the interpretation of CT scan images usually contoured in daily practice.

2163,"Local and disease control for nasal melanoma treated with radiation and concomitant anti-programmed death 1 antibody. Mucosal melanoma of the nasal cavity is a rare disease that has been consistently associated with poor outcome. While complete surgical excision offers the only prospect of a cure, it is associated with a high risk of surgical morbidity due to the challenging anatomical location, and most patients still develop incurable metastatic disease. The efficacy of immunotherapy on mucosal melanoma is lower in comparison with cutaneous melanoma, and mucosal melanoma rarely has BRAF mutations. Although preclinical data have shown that combination treatment with immune checkpoint inhibitors and radiotherapy (RT) improve the response, there have been few reports on the combination of RT and anti-programmed death 1 therapy for mucosal melanoma of the nasal cavity. We retrospectively investigated 10 cases of mucosal melanoma of the nasal cavity in which combined treatment was applied. The local control (LC) rate of the primary lesion and regional lymph nodes was favorably 100%. On the other hand, the median progression-free survival (PFS) time was 29.6 weeks (range, 2-82). The 6-month PFS rate was 60%. Although severe mucositis occurred in one patient, the incidence of treatment-related adverse events was not significantly increased. RT with anti-programmed death 1 antibody therapy for mucosal melanoma of the nasal cavity was tolerable and had the potential to improve LC and PFS.

2411,"Intravenous contrast agent influence on thoracic computed tomography simulation investigated through a heterogeneous dose calculation method using 5-Bulk densities. Objective: Using 5-bulk-density heterogeneous dose calculation, we investigated whether contrast-enhanced (CE+) computed tomography (CT) will affect dose-calculation accuracy in the thoracic area. Method(s): We analyzed 17 radiation-oncology patients who underwent thoracic CE+ CTs. Full-resolution CT and 5-bulk-density plans were generated using an adaptive convolution algorithm. Bulk densities for air, lung, fat, soft tissue, and bone were applied to regions identified by an isodensity segmentation tool. The population-averaged physical density of each region was calculated and compared with the reference value calculated from 66 noncontrast-enhanced (CE-) thoracic CT images. Using the 5-bulk densities, we created a new plan in which the physical densities of each area were forced to be the same as the CE- reference value, and we compared the dose-volume histograms (DVH). Result(s): Average physical density for the segmented air, lung, fat, soft tissue, and bone for CE+ were 0.14, 0.29, 0.90, 1.03, and 1.13 g/cm3, and the reference values for CE- were 0.14, 0.26, 0.89, 1.02, and 1.12 g/cm3, respectively. In all the cases, the normal-tissue DVH agreed to better than 1%. In 15 cases, DVH of the planning target volume (PTV) agreed to better than 3%. In 2 patients, >3% difference in the PTV dose was observed. Conclusion(s): Only 2 patients with a strong injection artifact in the PTV or beam showed >3% discrepancy in the target dose. When using CE+ CT for treatment planning, strong injection artifacts must be excluded. Copyright © 2011 by Lippincott Williams & Wilkins.",Excluded
3628,"A review of the effects of uranium and depleted uranium exposure on reproduction and fetal development. Depleted uranium (DU) is used in armor-penetrating munitions, military vehicle armor, and aircraft, ship and missile counterweighting/ballasting, as well as in a number of other military and commercial applications. Recent combat applications of DU alloy [i.e., Persian Gulf War (PGW) and Kosovo peacekeeping objective] resulted in human acute exposure to DU dust, vapor or aerosol, as well as chronic exposure from tissue embedding of DU shrapnel fragments. DU alloy is 99.8% 238Uranium, and emits approximately 60% of the alpha, beta, and gamma radiation found in natural uranium (4.05 x 10(-7) Ci/g DU alloy). DU is a heavy metal that is 160% more dense than lead and can remain within the body for many years and slowly solubilize. High levels of urinary uranium have been measured in PGW veterans 10 years after exposure to DU fragments and vapors. In rats, there is strong evidence of DU accumulation in tissues including testes, bone, kidneys, and brain. In vitro tests indicate that DU alloy may be both genotoxic and mutagenic, whereas a recent in vivo study suggests that tissue-embedded DU alloy may be carcinogenic in rats. There is limited available data for reproductive and teratological deficits from exposure to uranium per se, typically from oral, respiratory, or dermal exposure routes. Alternatively, there is no data available on the reproductive effects of DU embedded. This paper reviews published studies of reproductive toxicity in humans and animals from uranium or DU exposure, and discusses ongoing animal research to evaluate reproductive effects in male and female rats embedded with DU fragments, and possible consequences in F1 and F2 generations.",Excluded

Objective: To assess the efficacy of hypofractionated linac-based stereotactic radiotherapy with a micro-multileaf collimator (mMLC) in lung cancer patients with brain metastases. Method(s): Seventy-eight lesions of brain metastases in 49 lung cancer patients treated by stereotactic radiotherapy between September 2003 and December 2006 were analyzed. In the treatment planning, the planning target volume (PTV) was defined as an enhanced lesion plus 3 mm margin. A total dose of 39-42 Gy in three fractions was delivered to the isocenters of the PTV. Result(s): The median survival time after stereotactic radiotherapy was 17.4 months. The 1- and 2-year survival rates were 61% and 32%, respectively. The presence of extracranial tumors, the pre-treatment performance status, and the Radiation Therapy Oncology Group recursive partitioning analysis class were significant prognostic factors. The 1-and 2-year local recurrence rates were 14% and 17%, respectively, with no serious acute toxic effect. Injuries involving brain necrosis were observed in six patients. New brain metastases or meningeal carcinomatosis was seen in more than half of the patients following treatment with stereotactic radiotherapy.

Introduction: Extranodal follicular lymphoma (E-FL) is a rare entity that has distinct characteristics and outcomes compared with nodal follicular lymphoma. Patients and Methods: This cohort comprised 37 patients with stages I/II E-FL, diagnosed from 2003 to 2013. Outcomes included progression-free survival (PFS), and overall survival (OS). Survival outcomes were calculated using Kaplan-Meier methods. Result(s): Median age was 60 years (range, 37-84 years). Disease was stage I in 29 (78.4%). The Follicular Lymphoma International Prognostic Index score was 0 to 1 in 31 (83.8%), 2 in 2 (5.4%), 3 in 1 (2.7%), and missing in 3 (8.1%). Sites of involvement included the gastrointestinal (GI) tract in 22 (59.5%), and non-GI sites in 15 (40.5%). Initial management consisted of chemotherapy (CHT) alone in 21 (56.8%), radiation therapy (RT) alone in 2 patients (5.4%), RT and rituximab in 1 (2.7%), CHT and RT in 7 (18.9%), and observation in 6 (16.2%). RT was to a median dose of 30.6 Gy (range, 23.4-44.0 Gy). At a median follow-up of 69 months (range, 8-157 months), 5-year PFS and OS were 70.4% and 94.4%, respectively. Although the 5-year PFS of those observed was worse than for those who received therapy (33.3% vs. 77.6%; P = .011), that did not translate into an OS difference. Patients who received RT as part of upfront management had a 100% local control (LC) rate and a trend toward improved 5-year PFS (90% vs. 62.2%; P = .067). Conclusion(s): Early stage E-FL is an indolent disease and is associated with excellent OS. Treatment strategies should be individualized with RT prioritized when LC is a significant goal., This was a retrospective study to investigate management and outcomes of early stage extranodal follicular lymphoma patients because there is limited literature on this subgroup of patients. Although this is an indolent disease, we found a significant improvement in recurrence-free survival rates with treatment compared with observation alone. Patients who received radiation therapy as part of upfront treatment had excellent local control. The results of this study show that treatment should be individualized, and radiation can be a great option in patients for whom local control is essential.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.",Excluded
654,"Collaboration of homologous recombination and nonhomologous end-joining factors for the survival and integrity of mice and cells. Homologous recombination (HR) and nonhomologous end-joining (NHEJ) are mechanistically distinct DNA repair pathways that contribute substantially to double-strand break (DSB) repair in mammalian cells. We have combined mutations in factors from both repair pathways, the HR protein Rad54 and the DNA-end-binding factor Ku80, which has a role in NHEJ. Rad54(-/-)Ku80(-/-) mice were severely compromised in their survival, such that fewer double mutants were born than expected, and only a small proportion of those born reached adulthood. However, double-mutant mice died at lower frequency from tumors than Ku80 single mutant mice, likely as a result of rapid demise at a young age from other causes. When challenged with an exogenous DNA damaging agent, ionizing radiation, double-mutant mice were exquisitely sensitive to low doses. Tissues and cells from double-mutant mice also showed indications of spontaneous DNA damage. Testes from some Rad54(-/-)Ku80(-/-) mice displayed enhanced apoptosis and reduced sperm production, and embryonic fibroblasts from Rad54(-/-)Ku80(-/-) animals accumulated foci of gamma-H2AX, a marker for DSBs.

3009,"Dynamic visual acuity during walking after long-duration spacefl ight. Introduction: Astronauts experience alterations in gaze control as a result of adaptive changes in eye-head coordination produced by microgravity exposure. This may lead to potential changes in postfl ight visual acuity during head and body motion. Method(s): We gathered dynamic visual acuity (DVA) data from 14 astronauts and cosmonauts after longduration (~6 mo) stays in space. Walking was used to induce self-motion and visual acuity was determined by sequentially presenting Landolt ring optotypes on a computer display placed 4 m in front of subjects. Acuity assessments were made while seated (static condition) and walking (dynamic condition) at 6.4 km . h-1 on a motorized treadmill. In each condition, a psychophysical threshold detection algorithm minimized the required number of optotype presentations by maximizing the amount displayed around the subject's acuity threshold. The difference between static and dynamic acuity measures provided a metric of change in the subjects' ability to maintain gaze fi xation on the visual target while walking. Result(s): A decrement in postfl ight visual acuity during walking was found. A mean dynamic acuity decrement of approximately 0.75 eye-chart lines was observed 1 d after returning from space. The population mean showed a consistent improvement in DVA performance during the fi rst postfl ight week. Discussion(s): The recovery curves for individual subjects did not necessarily follow a pattern of continuous improvement with each passing day.

The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of 2.45 GHz microwave (MW) radiation on dimethylhydrazine (DMH)-induced colon cancer in mice. The subjects were 115 Balb/c mice 4 weeks of age. The animals were divided into group A (control), group B (DMH), group C (DMH+MW), and group D [DMH + 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13- acetate (TPA)]. Radiation (10 mW/cm2) was delivered dorsally with the E field parallel to the mouse's long body axis in an anechoic chamber. Radiations were administered 3 hr daily, 6 days per week, over a period of 5 months. The average SAR was estimated to be 10-12 W/kg. During the course of radiation treatments, DMH was injected once per week. The tumor promoter TPA was administered once per week for 10 weeks, from the third week on, after the initial treatment. The incidence of tumors did not significantly differ between the three test groups (groups B, C, and D; P > 0.25). However, the number of tumors, the size of the tumors, and the incidence of protuberant and infiltrative types in tumor-bearing animals were higher in group D compared to groups B and C (P < 0.05). No difference was found between groups B and C (P > 0.25). The study indicates that 2.45 GHz microwave radiation at 10 mW/cm2 power density did not promote DMH-induced colon cancers in young mice. The study also showed that TPA could accelerate colon tumor production if a tumor was initiated.",Excluded

PURPOSES: The physiological accumulation of fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose (FDG) is common in medical examinations of the digestive tract conducted using FDG-positron emission tomography (PET). The aim of this study was to determine the effects of a proton pump inhibitor (PPI) on the physiological FDG accumulation in the digestive tract., METHODS: A total of 130 patients examined from July 2007 to October 2008 were included in the final analysis. A PPI was administered orally prior to FDG-PET in 65 patients. The remaining 65 patients underwent FDG-PET without administration of the PPI. The assessments used visual and quantitative evaluations., RESULTS: Visual evaluation showed that physiological FDG accumulation in the stomach was significantly reduced (p = 0.037) in the PPI group compared with the control group. The quantitative evaluation also revealed a significant reduction in the maximum standardized uptake values (SUV(max)) in the stomach in the PPI group compared with the control group (p < 0.0001). Physiological FDG accumulation in the colon showed a decreasing trend on visual evaluation in the PPI group compared with the control group, and the quantitative evaluation found a significant reduction in the physiological FDG accumulation in the colon in the PPI group (p = 0.045)., CONCLUSIONS: The oral administration of a PPI was effective for reducing the physiological accumulation of the FDG in the alimentary tract. However, based on the error associated with SUV(max) measurement, a quantitative evaluation should therefore be combined with the visual evaluation.",Excluded

The spirometry and body plethysmography were performed after patient's clinical haemodynamic stabilization. The following lung function tests parameters were taken into analysis: forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1), Tiffeneau ratio -FEV1 %VCmax (Maximal Vital Capacity), total lung capacity (TLC), vital capacity (VC), total airway resistance (Rtot). All examinations were repeated 3 months after the discharge. The median follow-up was 61 months. The Student's t-test or Mann-Whitney-U test, chi2 test and Pearson correlation were used for the initial statistical analysis. Result(s): The ejection fraction (EF) <=35% (21,1%+/-7,42) was confirmed in all patients on admission and 3 months after the discharge (23,3+/-8%, p=0,05). The elevated BNP level (2131,3+/-1096,8 pg/ml) was revealed in all patients on admission. Both BNP levels after stabilization (1192,4+/-1070,8 pg/ml) and 3 months after the discharge (745,7+/-635pg/ml) were lower than initial (p<0,0001). The spirometry revealed obstructive disorders in 20 patients (80%) at the discharge and 3 months later. The body plethysmography confirmed restrictive disorders in 2 patients (8%) at the discharge. We revealed the significant correlations between FEV1%VCmax and the highest BNP level (r=-0,45, p=0,027 ) and BNP level on lung function tests day (r=-0,44, p=0,03). We also found negative relationships between: EF and FEV1 (r=-0,41, p=0,04), EF and TLC (r=-0,59, p=0,007), EF and FEV1 measured 3 months after the discharge (r=-0,45, p=0,04). The mortality rate achieved 44% in 3 and 52% in 5 year follow-up. There was a significant correlation between BNP level at the discharge (p<0,01), EF measured 3 months later (p=0,02) and death in 3 year follow-up period. Conclusion(s): Ventilatory disorders appeared in the majority of patients with CHF exacerbation and 3 months after this episode. There is a significant correlation between maximal BNP level, BNP after the stabilization and FEV1 % VCmax. There were no correlations between lung function tests parameters and mortality in early and late follow-up in this group of patients.",Excluded
3425,"Feasibility and reproducibility of hybrid 18F-FDG PET/MRI in the progression of early subclinical atherosclerosis (PESA) study. Background: Although hybrid technology using 18F-fluordeoxyglucose positron emission tomography and magnetic resonance imaging (18F-FDG PET/MRI) can provide in vivo molecular and anatomical information, data are limited regarding multi-territorial evaluation of atherosclerosis. Purpose(s): To assess the feasibility and reproducibility of 18F-FDG PET/MRI to characterize plaque burden, composition and inflammation in subclinical atherosclerosis. Method(s): A total of 938 asymptomatic participants with extensive atherosclerosis (age 48.0+/-4.3 years, 84% men) from the PESA (Progression of Early Subclinical Atherosclerosis) study underwent 18F-FDG PET/MRI of the carotid arteries, aorta, and ilio-femoral arteries 30 min after 18F-FDG injection (FDG dose 293+/-10.5 MBq, radiation dose 5.6+/-0.2 mSv). Arterial FDG uptake was evaluated on co-registered PET/MRI images using target-to-background ratios (TBR). Atherosclerotic burden was evaluated on T1-weighted MR images (indexed wall volume) and plaque characterization on T1- and T2- weighted MR images (lipidic, fibrous, mixed). Reproducibilities of FDG uptake and atherosclerotic burden/ composition were quantified in 15 PESA participants using intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC), kappa and Bland & Altman analysis. Result(s): A total of 842 (89.7%) 18F-FDG PET/MRI studies were available for final analysis (5.9% of which were incomplete, mainly lacking carotid imaging). FDG circulation time was 106.0+/-14.9 min for the ilio-femoral PET and 133.0+/-19.5 min for the carotid-aortic PET. Plaque composition analysis showed a Kappa value of 0.57. ICC of multi-territorial TBR was excellent (0.98; 95% CI of 0.97-0.98). ICC of multi-territorial indexed wall volume was good (0.89; 95% CI of 0.84-0.93). Bland & Altman plots showed good agreement for all explored territories, with mostly narrow confidence intervals (Figure). Conclusion(s): Hybrid 18F-FDG PET/MRI of multi-territory subclinical atherosclerosis in a single setting is feasible and highly reproducible, as demonstrated in the largest cohort ever reported for vascular PET/MRI, allowing multiparametric characterization of plaque burden, composition and inflammation.

805,"Radiosurgery with flattening-filter-free techniques in the treatment of brain metastases : Plan comparison and early clinical evaluation. BACKGROUND: Radiosurgical treatment of brain metastases is well established in daily clinical routine. Utilization of flattening-filter-free beams (FFF) may allow for more rapid delivery of treatment doses and improve clinical comfort. Hence, we compared plan quality and efficiency of radiosurgery in FFF mode to FF techniques., MATERIALS AND METHODS: Between November 2014 and June 2015, 21 consecutive patients with 25 brain metastases were treated with stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) in FFF mode. Brain metastases received dose-fractionation schedules of 1 x 20 Gy or 1 x 18 Gy, delivered to the conformally enclosing 80 % isodose. Three patients with critically localized or large (>3 cm) brain metastases were treated with 6 x 5 Gy. Plan quality and efficiency were evaluated by analyzing conformity, dose gradients, dose to healthy brain tissue, treatment delivery time, and number of monitor units. FFF plans were compared to those using the FF method, and early clinical outcome and toxicity were assessed., RESULTS: FFF mode resulted in significant reductions in beam-on time (p < 0.001) and mean brain dose (p = 0.001) relative to FF-mode comparison plans. Furthermore, significant improvements in dose gradients and sharper dose falloffs were found for SRS in FFF mode (-1.1 %, -29.6 %; p <= 0.003), but conformity was slightly superior in SRS in FF mode (-1.3 %; p = 0.001). With a median follow-up time of 5.1 months, 6-month overall survival was 63.3 %. Local control was observed in 24 of 25 brain metastases (96 %)., CONCLUSION: SRS in FFF mode is time efficient and provides similar plan quality with the opportunity of slightly reduced dose exposure to healthy brain tissue when compared to SRS in FF mode. Clinical outcomes appear promising and show only modest treatment-related toxicity.",Excluded
