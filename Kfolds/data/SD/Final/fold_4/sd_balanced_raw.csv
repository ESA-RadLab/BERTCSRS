7,"Expression of Epstein-Barr virus-encoded BamH1-A rightward transcript 7 microRNA in nasopharyngeal carcinoma cells modulates the responsive to irradiation treatment. Background Nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) is highly sensitive to irradiation treatment. Expression of Epstein-Barr virus gene products will affect the radiosensitivity of the cancer cells. Here, the association between EBV BamH1-A rightward transcript 7 microRNA (ebv-miR-BART7) and the effects on irradiation sensitivity was explored. Methods Tissue ebv-miR-BART7 expression level was quantified using real-time quantitative PCR. The radiosensitivity of nasopharyngeal carcinoma cells with ebv-miR-BART7 expression was evaluated by colony formation assay, cell proliferation assay, apoptosis assay, H2AX phosphorylation staining and acridine orange staining. In addition, xenograft model was developed using zebrafish embryo to validate the in vivo radiation sensitivity of the ebv-miR-BART7-expressing NPC. Results Primary NPC tissues and recurrent NPC tissues had a significant higher ebv-miR-BART7 level in comparison with the corresponding normal counterparts. ebv-miR-BART7-expressing NPC cells had higher sensitivity to irradiation treatment. Conclusion Our results suggested that NPC patients have an elevated ebv-miR-BART expression in the primary NPC and recurrent NPC tissue. High ebv-miR-BART increases the sensitivity of NPC cells to irradiation treatment. Further investigation on the clinical value of ebv-miR-BART7 to the therapeutic response is warranted to evaluate the potential use of ebv-miR-BART7 as molecular biomarker in monitoring NPC patients.",Included

26,"Tolerance doses of cutaneous and mucosal tissues in ring-necked parakeets (Psittacula krameri) for external beam megavoltage radiation. Currently used dosages for external-beam megavoltage radiation therapy in birds have been extrapolated from mammalian patients and often appear to provide inadequate doses of radiation for effective tumor control. To determine the tolerance doses of cutaneous and mucosal tissues of normal birds in order to provide more effective radiation treatment for tumors that have been shown to be radiation responsive in other species, ingluvial mucosa and the skin over the ingluvies of 9 ring-necked parakeets (Psittacula krameri) were irradiated in 4-Gy fractions to a total dose of either 48, 60, or 72 Gy using an isocentric cobalt-60 teletherapy unit. Minimal radiation-induced epidermal changes were present in the high-dose group histologically. Neither dose-related acute nor chronic radiation effects could be detected in any group grossly in cutaneous or mucosal tissue over a 9-month period. Radiation doses of 72 Gy in 4-Gy fractions were well tolerated in the small number of ring-necked parakeets in this initial tolerance dose study.",Included
36,"Oxidative stress and low dose ionizing radiation. The field of radiation biochemistry has provided tremendous impact in recent years as extensive research on free radicals has implicated them in radiation damage. An important offshoot of this field is the branch dealing with radiological protection in medical applications like diagnostic radiology. Hence, we decided to investigate the relationship between oxidative stress and low dose ionizing radiation (x-rays) in the work environment of x-ray technicians (radiographers), by comparing their RBC malondialdehyde, % hemolysis, catalase and plasma vitamin E levels with those of controls. There was a significant increase in the susceptibility of RBCs to hemolysis in radiographers compared to controls. Malondialdehyde and catalase levels were slightly increased in the radiographers, but this did not disturb the steady state concentration of their plasma vitamin E. These findings go in favour of theories stating that exposure to low dose ionizing radiation does cause a greater amount of oxidative stress, than that caused during normal routine metabolic processes.",Included
37,"Transcriptional corepressor MTG16 regulates small intestinal crypt proliferation and crypt regeneration after radiation-induced injury. Myeloidtranslocation genes (MTGs) are transcriptional corepressorsimplicated in development, malignancy, differentiation, and stem cellfunction. While MTG16 loss renders mice sensitive to chemicalcolitis, the role of MTG16 in the small intestine is unknown. Histologicalexamination revealed that Mtg16-/- mice have increasedenterocyte proliferation and goblet cell deficiency. After exposure toradiation, Mtg16-/- mice exhibited increased crypt viability anddecreased apoptosis compared with wild-type (WT) mice. Flow cytometricand immunofluorescence analysis of intestinal epithelial cellsfor phospho-histone H2A.X also indicated decreased DNA damageand apoptosis in Mtg16-/- intestines. To determine if Mtg16 deletionaffected epithelial cells in a cell-autonomous fashion, intestinal cryptswere isolated from Mtg16-/- mice. Mtg16-/-and WT intestinalcrypts showed similar enterosphere forming efficiencies when culturedin the presence of EGF, Noggin, and R-spondin. However, whenMtg16-/- crypts were cultured in the presence of Wnt3a, theydemonstrated higher enterosphere forming efficiencies and delayedprogression to mature enteroids. Mtg16-/- intestinal crypts isolatedfrom irradiated mice exhibited increased survival compared with WTintestinal crypts. Interestingly, Mtg16 expression was reduced in astem cell-enriched population at the time of crypt regeneration. Thisis consistent with MTG16 negatively regulating regeneration in vivo.Taken together, our data demonstrate that MTG16 loss promotesradioresistance and impacts intestinal stem cell function, possibly dueto shifting cellular response away from DNA damage-induced apoptosisand towards DNA repair after injury.Copyright © 2015 the American Physiological Society.",Included
38,"Less efficient g2-m checkpoint is associated with an increased risk of lung cancer in African Americans. Cell cycle checkpoints play critical roles in the maintenance of genomic integrity. The inactivation of checkpoint genes by genetic and epigenetic mechanisms is frequent in all cancer types, as a less-efficient cell cycle control can lead to genetic instability and tumorigenesis. In an on-going case-control study consisting of 216 patients with non-small cell lung cancer, 226 population-based controls, and 114 hospital-based controls, we investigated the relationship of gamma-radiation-induced G2-M arrest and lung cancer risk. Peripheral blood lymphocytes were cultured for 90 hours, exposed to 1.0 Gy gamma-radiation, and harvested at 3 hours after gamma-radiation treatment. gamma-Radiation-induced G2-M arrest was measured as the percentage of mitotic cells in untreated cultures minus the percentage of mitotic cells in gamma-radiation-treated cultures from the same subject. The mean percentage of gamma-radiation-induced G2-M arrest was significantly lower in cases than in population controls (1.18 versus 1.44, P < 0.01) and hospital controls (1.18 versus 1.40, P = 0.01). When dichotomized at the 50th percentile value in combined controls (population and hospital controls), a lower level of gamma-radiation-induced G2-M arrest was associated with an increased risk of lung cancer among African Americans after adjusting for baseline mitotic index, age, gender, and pack-years of smoking [adjusted odd ratio (OR), 2.25; 95% confidence interval (95% CI), 0.97-5.20]. A significant trend of an increased risk of lung cancer with a decreased level of G2-M arrest was observed (P(trend) = 0.02) among African Americans, with a lowest-versus-highest quartile adjusted OR of 3.74 (95% CI, 0.98-14.3). This trend was most apparent among African American females (P(trend) < 0.01), with a lowest-versus-highest quartile adjusted OR of 11.75 (95% CI, 1.47-94.04). The results suggest that a less-efficient DNA damage-induced G2-M checkpoint is associated with an increased risk of lung cancer among African Americans. Interestingly, we observed a stronger association of DNA damage-induced G2-M arrest and lung cancer among African Americans when compared with Caucasians. If replicated, these results may provide clues to the exceedingly high lung cancer incidence experienced by African Americans.",Included

52,"Expression of activated checkpoint kinase 2 and histone 2AX in exfoliative oral cells after exposure to ionizing radiation. Gamma-H2AX (activated histone 2AX) and pChk2 (activated checkpoint kinase 2), which are DNA damage response molecules, are produced in irradiated cells and may be signature molecules of radiation exposure. We investigated their use as potential biomarkers to identify individuals exposed to ionizing radiation. We collected exfoliated oral epithelial cell samples from 100 healthy individuals undergoing routine dental radiographic examination (2.34 cGy) both before and after the radiograph using a non-invasive technique. The expression levels of pChk2 and gamma-H2AX in oral cells were assessed by immunohistochemical assay. Both biomarkers showed statistically significant increases in levels of expression after the radiation exposure (P < 0.001). This suggests that pChk2 and gamma-H2AX may serve as sensitive indicators of low-dose radiation exposure.",Included
56,"Lack of correlation between villus and crypt damage in irradiated mouse intestine. It has been observed that scanning electron microscopy is a more sensitive indicator of mucosal damage at low radiation dose levels than conventional quantitative crypt counting techniques. Three different fractionation schedules were subjected to investigation by both of these methods to try to elucidate some features of irradiation damage to the whole of the intestinal mucosa, at dose levels commonly used in clinical practice. Despite variations in the qualitative observations, there was a marked difference in two of the schedules between damage expressed as crypt counts and that described by the qualitative techniques. In the first case high crypt numbers were associated with severe mucosal damage, whereas the second schedule produced a reduced crypt count in association with low damage to the surface mucosa. A third schedule produced results in which there was a general agreement between low crypt numbers and considerable surface mucosal damage. However, observations were made of mucosal formations not previously seen on damaged mucosal surfaces. These resembled the appearance normally associated with the gut of patients suffering from coeliac disease. Variations in the qualitative observations were seen in all the schedules so that their interpretation in terms of perturbation of cellular kinetics is difficult.",Included

Evidence to date from a number of studies, indicates that there is an increased incidence of thyroid cancer among A-bomb survivors, and that the incidence rises with increase of dose and is especially predominant in females exposed at younger ages. Although 45 years have elapsed since A-bomb exposure, there are still some questions about the development of thyroid cancer: 1) Is the incidence now decreasing? 2) What factors, other than radiation exposure, are involved? 3) What is the incidence of multiple cancer, including thyroid cancer? With these questions in mind, it is apparent that studies in this field must continue for some time to come.",Included

94,"The role of adjuvant radiotherapy in the local management of desmoplastic melanoma. BACKGROUND In the current study, the authors sought to evaluate outcomes, specifically with respect to adjuvant radiotherapy (RT), for patients with desmoplastic melanoma. METHODS The records of 130 consecutive patients who presented between 1985 and 2009 with nonmetastatic desmoplastic melanoma and were treated curatively with either surgery alone (59 patients; 45%) or surgery and postoperative RT (71 patients; 55%) were retrospectively reviewed. Ages ranged from 21 years to 97 years (median age, 66 years). The location of the primary tumor was in the head and neck region in 62% of patients. Only 5 patients (4%) had lymph node involvement at the time of presentation. RESULTS The median follow-up was 6.6 years (range, 11 months-24 years). Overall survival rates at 5 years and 10 years were 69% and 53%, respectively. Disease-specific survival rates were 84% and 80%, respectively, at 5 years and 10 years. The actuarial rate of local recurrence was 17% at 5 years and beyond. Of the patients who underwent surgery without receiving postoperative RT, 14 (24%) experienced local recurrence. Of the 71 patients treated with surgery and postoperative RT, 5 (7%) experienced local recurrence. In a Cox multivariate regression model, improved local control was significantly associated with the receipt of postoperative RT (P = .009).

99,"Enhancing Cytogenetic Biological Dosimetry Capabilities of the Philippines for Nuclear Incident Preparedness. The utility of a biological dosimeter based on the analysis of dicentrics is invaluable in the event of a radiological emergency wherein the estimated absorbed dose of an exposed individual is crucial in the proper medical management of patients. The technique is also used for routine monitoring of occupationally exposed workers to determine radiation exposure. An in vitro irradiation study of human peripheral blood lymphocytes was conducted to establish a dose-response curve for radiation-induced dicentric aberrations. Blood samples were collected from volunteer donors and together with optically stimulated luminescence (OSL) dosimeters and were irradiated at 0, 0.1, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1, 2, 4, and 6 Gy using a cobalt-60 radiotherapy unit. Blood samples were cultured for 48 h, and the metaphase chromosomes were prepared following the procedure of the International Atomic Energy Agency's Emergency Preparedness and Response - Biodosimetry 2011 manual. At least 100 metaphases were scored for dicentric aberrations at each dose point. The data were analyzed using R language program. The results indicated that the distribution of dicentric cells followed a Poisson distribution and the dose-response curve was established using the estimated model, Ydic = 0.0003 (+/-0.0003) +0.0336 (+/-0.0115) x D + 0.0236 (+/-0.0054) x D2. In this study, the reliability of the dose-response curve in estimating the absorbed dose was also validated for 2 and 4 Gy using OSL dosimeters. The data were fitted into the constructed curve. The result of the validation study showed that the obtained estimate for the absorbed exposure doses was close to the true exposure doses.",Included

125,"Genetic susceptibility to thymic lymphomas and K-ras gene mutation in mice after exposure to X-rays and N-ethyl-N-nitrosourea. PURPOSE: Ras activation is one of the major mechanisms for the development of murine thymic lymphomas by radiation and chemical carcinogens. To gain insight into the relationship between genetic susceptibility and ras gene mutation, the frequency and spectrum of ras gene mutation was examined in thymic lymphomas from susceptible and resistant mice., MATERIALS AND METHODS: K- and N-ras mutations in thymic lymphomas that arose in X-ray-irradiated and N-ethyl-N-nitrosourea (ENU)-treated mice of susceptible C57BL/6, rather resistant C3H and their hybrid B6C3F1 were analysed by polymerase chain reaction-single-strand conformation polymorphism and subsequent DNA sequencing., RESULTS: C57BL/6 exhibited a higher incidence of thymic lymphomas after exposure to X-rays and ENU than C3H, with B6C3F1 being intermediate. K-ras gene mutations occurred frequently in the pathogenesis of ENU-induced thymic lymphomas in susceptible C57BL/6 as opposed to resistant C3H. The ras mutations were more frequent in ENU-induced thymic lymphomas than X-ray-induced thymic lymphomas, and with the latter, there was no clear evidence for strain differences, suggesting that the genetic susceptibility to X-rays was independent of ras activation. The mutations of K-ras in thymic lymphomas from C57BL/6 were predominantly GGT to GAT in codon 12, whereas this mutation type was never found in those from C3H. No strain difference was observed in the nucleotide sequence or expression levels of O(6)-alkylguanine alkyltransferase, indicating that this enzyme did not account for the genetic susceptibility to ras activation., CONCLUSIONS: The results indicate that there is a clear strain and carcinogen dependency of K-ras mutation and that the frequency of ras mutation might determine the genetic susceptibility to ENU-induced lymphomagenesis, whereas pathways independent of ras activation might determine the susceptibility to X-ray-induced lymphomagenesis.",Included
143,"Reduction of Delayed Homologous Recombination by Induction of Radioadaptive Response in RaDR-GFP Mice (Yonezawa Effect): An Old Player With a New Role. Radiotherapy (RT) treats cancer effectively with high doses of ionizing radiation (IR) to killing cancer cells and shrinking tumors while bearing the risk of developing different side effects, including secondary cancer, which is most concerning for long-term health consequences. Genomic instability (GI) is a characteristic of most cancer cells, and IR-induced GI can manifest as delayed homologous recombination (HR). Radioadaptive response (RAR) is capable of reducing genotoxicity, cell transformation, mutation, and carcinogenesis, but the rational evidence describing its contributions to the reduction of radiation risk, in particular, carcinogenesis, remains fragmented. In this work, to investigate the impact of RAR on high-dose, IR-induced GI measured as delayed HR, the frequency of recombinant cells was comparatively studied under RAR-inducible and -uninducible conditions in the nucleated cells in hematopoietic tissues (bone marrow and spleen) using the Rosa26 Direct Repeat-green fluorescent protein (RaDR-GFP) homozygote mice. Results demonstrated that the frequency of recombinant cells was significantly lower in hematopoietic tissues under RAR-inducible condition. These findings suggest that reduction in delayed HR may be at least a part of the mechanisms underlying decreased carcinogenesis by RAR, and application of RAR would contribute to a more rigorous and scientifically grounded system of radiation protection in RT.Copyright © The Author(s) 2019.",Included

157,"Randomized trial addressing risk features and time factors of surgery plus radiotherapy in advanced head-and-neck cancer. Purpose: A multi-institutional, prospective, randomized trial was undertaken in patients with advanced head-and-neck squamous cell carcinoma to address (1) the validity of using pathologic risk features, established from a previous study, to determine the need for, and dose of, postoperative radiotherapy (PORT); (2) the impact of accelerating PORT using a concomitant boost schedule; and (3) the importance of the overall combined treatment duration on the treatment outcome. Methods and Materials: Of 288 consecutive patients with advanced disease registered preoperatively, 213 fulfilled the trial criteria and went on to receive therapy predicated on a set of pathologic risk features: no PORT for the low-risk group (n=31); 57.6 Gy during 6.5 weeks for the intermediate-risk group (n=31); and, by random assignment, 63 Gy during 5 weeks (n=76) or 7 weeks (n=75) for the high-risk group. Patients were irradiated with standard techniques appropriate to the site of disease and likely areas of spread. The study end points were locoregional control (LRC), survival, and morbidity. Result(s): Patients with low or intermediate risks had significantly higher LRC and survival rates than those with high-risk features (p=0.003 and p=0.0001, respectively), despite receiving no PORT or lower dose PORT, respectively. For high-risk patients, a trend toward higher LRC and survival rates was noted when PORT was delivered in 5 rather than 7 weeks. A prolonged interval between surgery and PORT in the 7-week schedule was associated with significantly lower LRC (p=0.03) and survival (p=0.01) rates. Consequently, the cumulative duration of combined therapy had a significant impact on the LRC (p=0.005) and survival (p=0.03) rates. A 2-week reduction in the PORT duration by using the concomitant boost technique did not increase the late treatment toxicity. Conclusion(s): This Phase III trial established the power of risk assessment using pathologic features in determining the need for, and dose of, PORT in patients with advanced head-and-neck squamous cell cancer in a prospective, multi-institutional setting. It also revealed the impact of the overall treatment time in the combination of surgery and PORT on the outcome in high-risk patients and showed that PORT acceleration without a reduction in dose by a concomitant boost regimen did not increase the late complication rate. These findings emphasize the importance of coordinated interdisciplinary care in the delivery of combined surgery and RT. © 2001 Elsevier Science Inc.",Included
162,"Antisense oligonucleotide targeting p53 increased apoptosis of MCF-7 cells induced by ionizing radiation. AIM: To investigate the effect of antisense compounds (AS) targeting human p53 mRNA on radiosensitivity of MCF-7 cells., METHODS: Western blotting and RTPCR were used to analyze the protein content and mRNA level. Additionally, cell proliferation, cell cycle and cell apoptosis were all analyzed in irradiated or sham-irradiated cells., RESULTS: Among the five antisense compounds (AS), AS3 was identified to efficiently inhibit p53 mRNA level and protein content. Interestingly, AS3 transfer has little effect on cell proliferation in DU-145 cells (mutant p53) after ionizing radiation (IR). In contrast, a marked increase of cell apoptosis and growth inhibition were observed in MCF-7 cells (wild-type p53), suggesting that AS3 can increase radiosensitivity of MCF-7 cells. Additionally, it was also observed that the transfection of AS3 decreased the fraction of G1 phase cells, and increased the proportion of S phase cells compared to untreated cells 24 h after IR in MCF-7 cell lines., CONCLUSION: AS3 transfection increases MCF-7 cell apoptosis induced by 5 Gy-radiation, and this mechanism may be closely associated with abrogation of G1 phase arrest.",Included
166,"Analysis by alkaline comet assay of cancer patients with severe reactions to radiotherapy: Defective rejoining of radioinduced DNA strand breaks in lymphocytes of breast cancer patients. Therapeutic exposure to ionising radiation reveals inter-individual variations in normal tissue responses. To examine whether a defect in DNA repair capacity might be involved in such hypersensitive phenotypes, we analysed, using the alkaline comet assay, the response as a function of time to in vitro irradiation at 5 Gy of lymphocytes from 17 breast cancer and 9 Hodgkin's disease patients who developed severe reactions to radiotherapy in comparison with 22 patients with 'average' reactions and 24 healthy donors. A difference between breast cancer over-reactors and both patients with normal reactions and healthy donors was observed 30 and 60 min after exposure. A subgroup of breast cancer over-reactors (7/17) reproducibly demonstrated increased levels of residual damage. When the kinetic analyses were prolonged to 120 min, results were in favour of delayed kinetics of rejoining in these patients. Among Hodgkin's disease over-reactors, only one patient showed defective repair. Interestingly, all patients with the most severe complications (grade 4 RTOG/EORTC), i.e., 5 breast cancer and 1 Hodgkin's disease, showed impaired rejoining. Our results suggest that impairment in DNA strand break processing may be associated, in specific subgroups of breast cancer patients, with an individual risk of major toxicity of radiation therapy. Thus, the alkaline comet assay appears to be useful for documenting the DNA repair phenotype in cancer patients.",Included
173,"Protection of radiation-induced damage to the hematopoietic system, small intestine and salivary glands in rats by JNJ7777120 compound, a histamine H4 ligand. Based on previous data on the histamine radioprotective effect on highly radiosensitive tissues, in the present work we aimed at investigating the radioprotective potential of the H4R ligand, JNJ7777120, on ionizing radiation-induced injury and genotoxic damage in small intestine, salivary glands and hematopoietic tissue. For that purpose, rats were divided into 4 groups. JNJ7777120 and JNJ7777120-irradiated groups received a daily subcutaneous JNJ7777120 injection (10 mg/kg) starting 24 h before irradiation. Irradiated groups received a single dose of 5 Gy on whole-body using Cesium-137 source and were sacrificed 3 or 30 days after irradiation. Tissues were removed, fixed, stained with hematoxylin and eosin or PAS staining and histological characteristics were evaluated. Proliferative and apoptotic markers were studied by immunohistochemistry, while micronucleus assay was performed to evaluate DNA damage. Submandibular gland (SMG) function was evaluated by methacholine-induced salivation. Results indicate that JNJ7777120 treatment diminished mucosal atrophy and preserved villi and the number of crypts after radiation exposure (240+/-8 vs. 165+/-10, P<0.01). This effect was associated to a reduced apoptosis and DNA damage in intestinal crypts. JNJ7777120 reduced radiation-induced aplasia, preserving medullar components and reducing formation of micronucleus and also it accelerated bone marrow repopulation. Furthermore, it reduced micronucleus frequency in peripheral blood (27+/-8 vs. 149+/-22, in 1,000 erythrocytes, P<0.01). JNJ7777120 completely reversed radiation-induced reduced salivation, conserving glandular mass with normal histological appearance and reducing apoptosis and atrophy of SMG.

179,"The age-dependent effect of high-dose X-ray radiation on NFkappaB signaling, structure, and mechanical behavior of the intervertebral disc. Purpose: Ionizing radiation damages tissue and provokes inflammatory responses in multiple organ systems. We investigated the effects of high-dose X-ray radiation on the molecular inflammation and mechanical function of the intervertebral disc (IVD). Methods: Functional spine units (FSUs) containing the vertebrae-IVDs-vertebrae structure extracted from 1-month, 6-month, and 16-month-old NFkappaB-luciferase reporter mice and from 6-month-old myeloid differentiation factor 88 (MyD88)-null mice. After a preconditioning period in culture, the FSUs were subjected a single dose of ionizing X-ray radiation at 20 Gys, and then NFkappaB expression was monitored. The IVDs were then subjected to mechanical testing using dynamic compression, glycosaminoglycan (GAG) quantification, and histological analyses. Results: In the 1-month-old FSUs, the NFkappaB-driven luciferase activity was significantly elevated for 1 day following the exposure to radiation. The 6-month-old FSUs showed increased NFkappaB activity for 3 days, while the 16-month-old FSUs sustained elevated levels of NFkappaB activity throughout the 10-day culture period. All irradiated groups showed significant loss of disc height, GAG content, mechanical function and changes in structure. Ablation of MyD88 blunted the radiation-mediated NFkappaB signaling, and preserved GAG content, and the IVDs' structure and mechanical performance. Conclusions: These results suggest that high-dose radiation affects the IVDs' NFkappaB-dependent inflammatory processes that subsequently lead to functional deterioration. Blocking the transactivation potential of NFkappaB via MyD88 ablation preserved the structure and mechanical function of the FSUs. The long-term effects of radiation on IVD homeostasis should be considered in individuals susceptible to occupational and medical exposure.",Included

Alkaline phosphatase activity appeared in the male only. The intestinal metaplasia induced by stomach antigen injection in the male persisted longer than in the female. Moreover, the incidence of intestinal metaplasia caused by whole body irradiation in ovariectomized rats was significantly higher than in the sham-ovariectomized ones.

216,"Comparative stochastic effects of inhaled alpha- and beta-particle- emitting radionuclides in beagle dogs. The stochastic effects of inhaled, insoluble particles of alpha- or beta- particle-emitting radionuclides were compared in dogs. Male and female beagle dogs were exposed briefly by nasal inhalation to relatively insoluble aerosols of 239PuO2 or 144Ce in fused aluminosilicate particles (FAP) and observed for cancer for their lifetimes. The initial lung burden and retention of each radionuclide was determined by whole-body counting of the emissions from 144Ce-144Pr- or 169Yb-labeled 239PuO2. Lung doses were calculated for each dog from these data. The lung doses ranged from 0.21 to 1200 Gy for 144Ce FAP and 1.6 to 58 Gy for 239PuO2. Dogs with doses to the lung of about 60 Gy or greater from 144Ce or about 2 Gy or greater from 239PuO2 had an increased incidence of lung carcinomas. In dogs exposed to 144Ce FAP, three organs were targets for neoplasia: lung, tracheobronchial lymph nodes, and heart. The insoluble FAP carried to the lymph nodes draining the lung delivered high radiation doses to the nodes and adjacent heart, resulting in hemangiosarcomas of these organs. In the lung, high radiation doses induced hemangiosarcomas and carcinosarcomas. At lower doses, carcinomas of various histological patterns were induced in the lung. In dogs exposed to 239PuO2, the lung was the sole target organ for neoplasia. Nearly all of these neoplasms were carcinomas of various histological patterns. These results indicated that relatively low doses of alpha-particle radiation can induce pulmonary cancers, but relatively large doses of beta-particle radiation are required. In addition, inhaled beta-particle emitters can also induce cancers in lung-associated lymph nodes and heart at these larger absorbed radiation doses.",Included
219,"Different trend for changing of mammalian plasma (serum) antioxidant activity after irradiation at large and low-doses. One of the path for research of antioxidant status in vivo is the determination of blood plasma (serum) antioxidant activity (AOA). AOA is an integral parameter for the contribution of different antiradical defense components which particular nomenclature is determined by a used method of definition. In the present work AOA is studied with usage of a system of suppression in vitro by blood plasma (serum) of a Fe(2+)-induced oxidation of a substrate from egg yolk lipoproteins. The contribution of separate components of a blood plasma to an integral index of AOA for human blood serum is studied. Urine acid, albumin, reduced glutathione, ascorbat, heparin, peroxidase and catalase had no activity. Apo-beta-lipoprotein, vitamin E, ceruloplasmin and transferring are introduce, possibly, the main contribution to AOA.

The irradiation of mice at low-dose (0.2 Gy), vice-versa, result to stimulation of AOA with clear peak value on 5 day.

223,"Expanded Characterization of a Hemi-Body Shielded Gottingen Minipig Model of Radiation-induced Gastrointestinal Injury Incorporating Oral Dosing Procedures. In collaboration with the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA), the authors recently conducted a pilot study in a hemi-body shielded model of radiation-induced gastrointestinal (GI) injury in Gottingen minipigs following exposure to radiation dose levels between 8-16 Gy. Herein, the impact of oral dosing procedures is assessed, as well as the specific causes of death in animals exposed to radiation doses of 14 and 16 Gy (n = 64; 32 male, 32 female, between 6 and 8 mo of age). Oral dosing using a 2-tablet placebo system comprised of both immediate release and enteric-coated tablets starting 24 h post-irradiation resulted in inhibited gastric emptying of the enteric-coated tablets, which were found to be retained in the stomach and/or regurgitated. This finding appears to be species-specific, as similar findings have not been reported for other large animal species (e.g., non-human primates). Mortality was primarily dictated by decreased activity, body weight loss (>35%), and/or respiratory distress, despite shielding of the lung. The cause of respiratory distress in animals that were pre-terminally euthanized varied according to the timing of death, with interstitial inflammation and extensive fibrosis observed >20 days post-irradiation. Kidney damage was also identified in most animals after day 10. Changes in the GI tract were consistent with previous studies and included collagen deposition/fibrosis. Observations of inflammatory infiltrates and interstitial inflammation/fibrosis in both shielded and unshielded organs support a strong secondary inflammatory syndrome post-irradiation.",Included
228,"Curvature in the cancer mortality dose response in Japanese atomic bomb survivors: absence of evidence of threshold. PURPOSES: To investigate the evidence for a threshold in the cancer dose-response curve., MATERIALS AND METHODS: Japanese atomic bomb survivor cancer mortality data, based on follow-up to 1990, was used, taking account of random errors in DS86 dose estimates., RESULTS: For all solid cancers analysed together, there is a significant positive dose response (two-sided p<0.05) if all survivors who received <0.5 Sv are considered, but the significance vanishes if doses of <0.2 Sv are considered; the same is also true for leukaemia. For solid cancer mortality there is no indication of curvilinearity in the dose response: no statistically significant improvement in fit to a linear relative risk model is provided by addition of quadratic or threshold dose terms. If a relative risk model with a threshold (the dose response is assumed linear above the threshold) is fitted to solid cancer mortality data, the best estimate of the threshold is < 0.00 Sv (95% CI <0.00-0.13). If a linear-quadratic-threshold model is used the best estimate of the threshold is < 0.00 Sv (95% CI < 0.00-0.15). For leukaemia mortality there is highly statistically significant upward curvature in the dose response. In particular, if a relative risk model with a threshold (the dose response is assumed linear above the threshold) is fitted to the leukaemia data, the best estimate of the threshold is 0.16 Sv (95% CI 0.05-0.40) (two-sided p=0.001 for test of departure of threshold from 0). However, there is no evidence for a threshold effect (two-sided p = 0.16) when a quadratic term is included in the dose response: the best estimate of threshold in this case is 0.09Sv (95% CI <0.00-0.29). Moreover, addition of a quadratic term improves the fit of a linear-threshold model at borderline levels of statistical significance (two-sided p = 0.07). Therefore, the most parsimonious description of the leukaemia dose response is provided by a linear-quadratic function of dose., CONCLUSIONS: There is no evidence of threshold-type departures from the linear-quadratic dose response either for solid tumours or for leukaemia in the Japanese atomic bomb survivor mortality data.",Included
230,"Effect of X-irradiation on epidermal immune function: decreased density and alloantigen-presenting capacity of Ia+ Langerhans cells and impaired production of epidermal cell-derived thymocyte activating factor (ETAF). The mechanisms involved in the modulation of cutaneous immune responses by UV radiation have been extensively investigated; by contrast, few studies have addressed the effects of x-irradiation on epidermal immune function. We therefore investigated the effect of x-irradiation of mice on: (a) the density of epidermal Ia+ Langerhans cells (LC) in immunofluorescence studies, (b) epidermal cell (EC) allostimulatory capacity in the allogeneic EC-lymphocyte reaction (ELR), and (c) production of epidermal cell-derived thymocyte activating factor (ETAF). C3H/He and BALB/c mice were irradiated with 900, 1,800, 2,700, or 3,600 rad from a 137Cs source, and sacrificed 10 h or 3 days later. X-irradiation of mice 10 h previously only slightly decreased the density of epidermal Ia+ LC and did not affect the capacity of their EC to stimulate allogeneic responder lymphocytes in the ELR. X-irradiation of mice 3 days previously, however, resulted in a dose-dependent decrease in the density of Ia+ LC. This decrease was accompanied by a substantial reduction in EC allostimulatory capacity in the ELR at all doses of x-irradiation. ETAF production by cultured EC from mice x-irradiated 3 days previously was also found to be diminished at all doses of x-irradiation. Trypan blue exclusion studies demonstrated that the observed decreases in EC allostimulatory capacity and ETAF production were not the result of a generalized lethal effect of x-irradiation on EC. The reduction in EC allostimulatory capacity following in vivo x-irradiation could not be reversed by addition of exogenous ETAF or interleukin-1 in the ELR. Taken together, these results indicate that x-irradiation decreases the density of Ia+ LC, impairs LC alloantigen-presenting function, and reduces ETAF production. Thus cutaneous x-irradiation may affect inflammatory and neoplastic processes not only by its antimitotic activity, but also by a direct effect on EC which subserve immunologic functions.",Included
233,"Long term effects of radiation exposure on telomere lengths of leukocytes and its associated biomarkers among atomic-bomb survivors. Ionizing radiation (IR) is a major source of cellular damage and the immediate cellular response to IR has been well characterized. But the long-term impact of IR on cell function and its relationship with aging are not known. Here, we examined the IR effects on telomere length and other biomarkers 50 to 68 years post-exposure (two time points per person) in survivors of the atomic bombing at Hiroshima during WWII. We found that telomere length of leukocytes was inversely correlated with the dose of IR (p=0.008), and this effect was primarily found in survivors who were exposed at younger ages; specifically those <12 years old (p=0.0004). Although a dose-related retardation of telomere shortening with age was observed in the cross-sectional data, longitudinal follow-up after 11 years did not show IR exposure-related alteration of the rate of telomere shortening with age. In addition, IR diminished the associations between telomere length and selected aging biomarkers that were observed in survivors with no dose. These included uric acid metabolism, cytokines, and blood T cell counts. These findings showed long-lasting detrimental effects of IR on telomere length of leukocytes in both dose- and age-at-exposure dependent manner, and on alterations of biomarkers with aging.",Included

Mass spectrometry-based metabolomics has previously demonstrated utility for identifying biomarkers of ionizing radiation exposure in cellular, mouse and rat in vivo radiation models. To provide a valuable link from small laboratory rodents to humans, gamma-radiation-induced urinary biomarkers were investigated using a nonhuman primate total-body-irradiation model. Mass spectrometry-based metabolomics approaches were applied to determine whether biomarkers could be identified, as well as the previously discovered rodent biomarkers of gamma radiation. Ultra-performance liquid chromatography-electrospray ionization quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry analysis was carried out on a time course of clean-catch urine samples collected from nonhuman primates (n = 6 per cohort) exposed to sham, 1.0, 3.5, 6.5 or 8.5 Gy doses of (60)Co gamma ray (~0.55 Gy/min) ionizing radiation. By multivariate data analysis, 13 biomarkers of radiation were discovered: N-acetyltaurine, isethionic acid, taurine, xanthine, hypoxanthine, uric acid, creatine, creatinine, tyrosol sulfate, 3-hydroxytyrosol sulfate, tyramine sulfate, N-acetylserotonin sulfate, and adipic acid. N-Acetyltaurine, isethionic acid, and taurine had previously been identified in rats, and taurine and xanthine in mice after ionizing radiation exposure. Mass spectrometry-based metabolomics has thus successfully revealed and verified urinary biomarkers of ionizing radiation exposure in the nonhuman primate for the first time, which indicates possible mechanisms for ionizing radiation injury.",Included
274,"Interventional cardiologists and risk of radiation-induced cataract: results of a French multicenter observational study. BACKGROUND: Interventional cardiologists (ICs) are exposed to X-rays and may be at risk to develop cataract earlier than common senile cataract. Excess risk of posterior subcapsular cataract, known as radiation-induced, was previously observed in samples of ICs from Malaysia, and Latin America. The O'CLOC study (Occupational Cataracts and Lens Opacities in interventional Cardiology) was performed to quantify the risk at the scale of France., METHODS: This cross-sectional multicenter study included an exposed group of ICs from different French centers and an unexposed control group of non-medical workers. Individual information was collected about cataract risk factors and past and present workload in catheterization laboratory. All participants had a clinical eye examination to classify the lens opacities (nuclear, cortical, or posterior subcapsular) with the international standard classification LOCS III., RESULTS: The study included 106 ICs (mean age = 51 +/- 7 years) and 99 unexposed control subjects (mean age = 50 +/- 7 years). The groups did not differ significantly in the prevalence of either nuclear or cortical lens opacities (61% vs. 69% and 23% vs. 29%, respectively). However, posterior subcapsular lens opacities, were significantly more frequent among ICs (17% vs. 5%, p=0.006), for an OR=3.9 [1.3-11.4]. The risk increased with duration of activity but no clear relationship with workload was observed. However, the risk appeared lower for regular users of protective lead glasses (OR=2.2 [0.4-12.8])., CONCLUSIONS: ICs, in France as elsewhere, are at high risk of posterior subcapsular cataracts. Use of protective equipment against X-rays, in particular lead glasses, is strongly recommended to limit this risk. Copyright © 2012 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.",Included
279,"Effects of heavy ions on rabbit tissues: cataractogenesis. As part of an investigation of the responses of optic and proximate tissues to heavy-ion irradiation, the lenses of New Zealand white rabbits were exposed to the Bragg plateau regions of 530 MeV/amu Ar ions and 365 MeV/amu Ne ions and also to 60Co gamma-photons. The linear energy transfers (LET infinity s) for the radiations were 90 +/- 5, 35 +/- 3, and 0.3 keV/micrometer, respectively. After irradiation, lenticular opacities were monitored through their incipient and/or clinical stages (less than or equal to 5 years) by slit-lamp biomicroscopy and scored with subjective, but well-defined, indices. Cataractogenesis, which progressed according to the model proposed by Rubin and Casarett (1968), was modified by radiation quality in the following ways. (1) The rate of development of the early (acute) stage increased with the LET infinity of the incident radiation; (2) at the intermediate (plateau) stage, the values for the relative biological effectiveness (r.b.e.) of the heavy ions were similar to those reported for proliferating cells in culture; (3) for a given intermediate level, the onset of late cataractogenesis occurred earlier the higher the LET affinity of the radiation involved.

282,"Effects of medical diagnostic X-rays delivered at 0.01 or 0.05 mGy on human blood cells. Background: Low-dose X-rays are commonly used in medical imaging to help in the diagnosis of diseases. However, the deleterious effects of exposure to medical diagnostic low-dose X-rays remain a highly debated topic. The objective was to study the effects of medical diagnostic X-rays on human blood cells. Material(s) and Method(s): We studied the effects of medical diagnostic low-dose X-rays (80 kVp), i.e.,0.01 or 0.05 mGy, after the in vitro exposure of human red blood cells (RBCs) and peripheral blood mononucleated cells (PBMCs).Cells with no irradiation served as the control group. The biological endpoints that were used to determine the effects of medical diagnostic low-dose X-rays were hemolysis for RBCs and mitochondrial membrane potential, lysosomes, and the cell cycle for PBMCs. Result(s): Our results showed no changes in the hemolysis of RBCs and mitochondrial membrane potential, lysosome, or cell cycle in cells exposed to these low doses of X-rays when compared to the corresponding nonirradiated cells at all harvest timepoints. Conclusion(s): These results suggested that there were no deleterious effects of diagnostic low-dose X-rays when human RBCs and PBMCs were exposed in vitro.Copyright © 2021, Ibn Sina Trust.

Although beneficial effects such as the retardation of tumor growth were evident in these studies, among the seventeen patients who received from 5000--6000 rads for malignant gliomas, four developed ""late delayed"" radiation necrosis. The strong predilection of this tissue response for the white matter adjacent to the neoplasm suggests a local sensitivity which may have been engendered or enhanced by cerebral edema. A fifth case disclosed focal demyelination in the mid-brain suggesting ""early delayed"" radiation necrosis, and an additional case had distinctive foci of necrosis within the brain stem. Changes of diffuse cerebral edema were noted in many of the radiated brains.

301,"Sex-specific radiation-induced microRNAome responses in the hippocampus, cerebellum and frontal cortex in a mouse model. Ionizing radiation is an important treatment modality, but it is also a well-known genotoxic agent capable of damaging cells and tissues. Therefore radiation treatment can cause numerous side effects in exposed tissues and organs. Radiotherapy is a part of the front-line treatment regime for brain cancer patients, but can cause severe functional and morphological changes in exposed brain tissues. However, the mechanisms of radiation-induced effects in the brain are not well understood and are under-investigated. Recent data has implicated short RNAs, especially microRNAs, as important in radiation responses, yet nothing is known about radiation-induced changes in the brain microRNAome. We analyzed the effects of X-ray irradiation on microRNA expression in the hippocampus, frontal cortex, and cerebellum of male and female mice. Here, we report tissue-, time-, and sex-specific brain radiation responses, as well as show evidence of an interplay between microRNAs and their targets. Specifically, we show that changes in the expression of the miR-29 family may be linked, at least in part, to altered expression of de novo methyltransferase DNMT3a and changed global DNA methylation levels. Further, these sex-specific epigenetic changes may be correlated to the prevalence of radiation-induced cancers in males. We identified several microRNAs that can potentially serve as biomarkers of brain radiation exposure. In summary, our study may provide an important roadmap for further analysis of microRNA expression in different brain regions of male and female mice and for detailed dissection of radiation-induced brain responses.",Included

315,"Does Vacuum-assisted Closure Reduce the Risk of Wound Complications in Patients With Lower Extremity Sarcomas Treated With Preoperative Radiation?. BACKGROUND: Although preoperative radiation followed by wide local excision yields excellent local control in soft tissue sarcomas, the risk of wound complications is reported to be higher compared with the incidence in patients who were administered postoperative radiation therapy. Vacuum (vac)-assisted closure may improve wound healing, but it is unknown whether vac-assisted closure during soft tissue sarcoma resection may reduce the risk of wound complications or impair local disease control., QUESTIONS/PURPOSES: (1) Does the use of a wound vac application at the time of soft tissue sarcoma resection reduce the risk of developing wound complications after lower extremity sarcoma resection? (2) Is vac-assisted closure associated with an increased risk of local relapse?, METHODS: From 2000 to 2016, 312 patients with stage I to III soft tissue sarcomas were treated. Of these, 123 were treated with preoperative radiation +/- chemotherapy followed by limb-sparing resection based on tumor location, size, grade, histology, and patient age. There was a minimum followup of 12 months. Radiation was delivered generally based on tumor size, grade, superficial versus deep nature, and proximity to neurovascular structures. Chemotherapy was administered in patients < 70 years old with high-grade tumors and tumors > 5 cm. Patient, demographic, and treatment variables, including incisional vac application and wound outcomes, were retrospectively evaluated. Incisional vac-assisted closure took place at the time of primary resection in 32% (46 of 123) of patients. Vac-assisted closure was considered when there was a concern for risk of external contamination such as instances in which fixation of adhesives would be difficult or regions where there was a high risk of contamination. Vac-assisted closure may have also been used in instances with increased wound tension at closure or with heightened concern for shearing on the wound such as buttock wounds. Ten patients were lost to followup, two in the vac group and eight in the non-vac group. Potential factors associated with wound complications were evaluated using Fisher's exact test for univariate analysis and logistic regression for multivariate analysis. Local recurrence-free survival was evaluated using the Kaplan-Meier estimate., RESULTS: After taking into consideration factors such as tumor size, location, age, and patient comorbidities, it was shown that patients who underwent vac-assisted closure were less likely to experience wound complications compared with patients who did not undergo vac-assisted closure (odds ratio, 0.129; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.041-0.398; p = 0.004). The local control incidence in the entire cohort was 98%. With the numbers available, Kaplan-Meier survivorship free from local recurrence did not differ between patients treated with or without the vac (100% [95% CI, 154.09-154.09] versus 96% [95% CI, 152.21-169.16]; p = 0.211), respectively., CONCLUSIONS: Vac-assisted closure at the time of resection of proximal lower extremity soft tissue sarcomas is associated with a lower risk of wound complications, and its use apparently did not compromise local control. We show that the use of vac-assisted closure may be worth considering in surgeons' attempts to reduce the risk of wound complications among patients with soft tissue sarcomas of the proximal lower extremities., LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Level III, therapeutic study.",Included

The effect of radiation on three discrete Ag-presentation functions in resting B cells was examined: 1) Ag uptake and processing, 2) expression of processed Ag in the context of functional class II molecules, and 3) provision of necessary co-stimulatory, or second,"" signals. Analysis of radiation's effect on B cell presentation of intact vs fragmented Ag or its effect on presentation by Ag-pulsed B cells indicated that damage to Ag uptake and processing could not account for the bulk of the radiation-induced Ag-presentation defect. Experiments with phosphatidylinositol hydrolysis as an indirect measure of TCR occupancy suggested that irradiation caused a fairly rapid (within 1 to 2 h) decrease in the ability of the B cell APC to display a stimulatory combination of Ag and class II molecule. Ag dose-response analyses demonstrated that when presenting a fragment of the Ag pigeon cytochrome c to a T cell clone, 3000 rad-treated B cell APC were able to stimulate approximately 50% as much phosphatidylinositol turnover as unirradiated B cells. It was also found that, in contrast to their inability to initiate T cell proliferation, and similarly to chemically cross-linked splenocytes, heavily irradiated resting B cells plus Ag induced a state of Ag hyporesponsiveness in T cell clones. This effect on T cells had the same Ag- and MHC-specificity as did receptor occupancy required for proliferation, indicating that heavily irradiated resting B cells bear functional class II molecules. Co-culture of T cells with allogeneic B cells and syngeneic heavily irradiated B cells or chemically cross-linked splenic APC plus Ag resulted in T cell proliferation and interfered with the induction of the hyporesponsive state. This co-stimulatory function was radiosensitive in resting allogeneic B cells. Together, these data support the hypothesis that the major functional consequences of radiation to resting B cell APC are a reduction in the effective display of Ag plus class II molecules and, probably what is more important, a loss in the ability to provide APC-derived co-stimulatory signals.""",Included

This chapter summarises the results of the preceding sections, which estimate the fraction of cancers occurring in the UK in 2010 that can be attributed to sub-optimal, past exposures of 14 lifestyle and environmental risk factors. For each of 18 cancer types, we present the percentage of cases attributable to one or all of the risk factors considered (tobacco, alcohol, four elements of diet (consumption of meat, fruit and vegetables, fibre, and salt), overweight, lack of physical exercise, occupation, infections, radiation (ionising and solar), use of hormones, and reproductive history (breast feeding)).Exposure to less than optimum levels of the 14 factors was responsible for 42.7% of cancers in the UK in 2010 (45.3% in men, 40.1% in women)-a total of about 134 000 cases.Tobacco smoking is by far the most important risk factor for cancer in the UK, responsible for 60 000 cases (19.4% of all new cancer cases) in 2010. The relative importance of other exposures differs by sex. In men, deficient intake of fruits and vegetables (6.1%), occupational exposures (4.9%) and alcohol consumption (4.6%) are next in importance, while in women, it is overweight and obesity (because of the effect on breast cancer)-responsible for 6.9% of cancers, followed by infectious agents (3.7%).Population- attributable fractions provide a valuable quantitative appraisal of the impact of different factors in cancer causation, and are thus helpful in prioritising cancer control strategies. However, quantifying the likely impact of preventive interventions requires rather complex scenario modelling, including specification of realistically achievable population distributions of risk factors, and the timescale of change, as well as the latent periods between exposure and outcome, and the rate of change following modification in exposure level. © 2011 Cancer Research UK All rights reserved.",Included

In this paper, some final results of 25-year investigations carried out in Scientific Centre for Radiation Medicine and Burns MH RA (SCRMB) on the Armenian cohort of the Chernobyl accident consequences liquidators are shown. These results show that health conditions of the liquidators became worse during the whole observation period. A considerable development of both pathological states atypical of radiation damages and diseases, which may be considered as radiation-induced ones, was determined. Rise of the sickness rate of almost all organism systems, first of all, nervous, cardiovascular, respiratory and digestive ones, was observed. In 70% of liquidators the main disease was primarily detected after working on CNPP. In the intervening years, the average number of diagnoses per 1 liquidator increased from 1.5 in 1987 to 7-8 in the recent time. In addition to the detected diseases, particular functional shifts in neuropsychological and vegetative status of the liquidators were observed.

BACKGROUND: Orthopedic strain and radiation exposure are recognized risk factors in personnel staff performing fluoroscopically guided cardiovascular procedures. However, the potential occupational health effects are still unclear. The purpose of this study was to examine the prevalence of health problems among personnel staff working in interventional cardiology/cardiac electrophysiology and correlate them with the length of occupational radiation exposure., METHODS AND RESULTS: We used a self-administered questionnaire to collect demographic information, work-related information, lifestyle-confounding factors, all current medications, and health status. A total number of 746 questionnaires were properly filled comprising 466 exposed staff (281 males; 44+/-9 years) and 280 unexposed subjects (179 males; 43+/-7years). Exposed personnel included 218 interventional cardiologists and electrophysiologists (168 males; 46+/-9 years); 191 nurses (76 males; 42+/-7 years), and 57 technicians (37 males; 40+/-12 years) working for a median of 10 years (quartiles: 5-24 years). Skin lesions (P=0.002), orthopedic illness (P<0.001), cataract (P=0.003), hypertension (P=0.02), and hypercholesterolemia (P<0.001) were all significantly higher in exposed versus nonexposed group, with a clear gradient unfavorable for physicians over technicians and nurses and for longer history of work (>16 years). In highly exposed physicians, adjusted odds ratio ranged from 1.7 for hypertension (95% confidence interval: 1-3; P=0.05), 2.9 for hypercholesterolemia (95% confidence interval: 1-5; P=0.004), 4.5 for cancer (95% confidence interval: 0.9-25; P=0.06), to 9 for cataract (95% confidence interval: 2-41; P=0.004)., CONCLUSIONS: Health problems are more frequently observed in workers performing fluoroscopically guided cardiovascular procedures than in unexposed controls, raising the need to spread the culture of safety in the cath laboratory.

SMRs for all causes and all malignant neoplasms were 81 and 84 respectively, demonstrating a 'healthy worker effect'. Within the cohort, mortality and incidence from both leukaemia excluding CLL and the grouping of all malignant neoplasms excluding leukaemia increased to a statistically significant extent with increasing radiation dose. Estimates of the trend in risk with dose were similar to those for the Japanese A-bomb survivors, with 90% confidence intervals that excluded both risks more than 2-3 times greater than the A-bomb values and no raised risk. Some evidence of an increasing trend with dose in mortality from all circulatory diseases may, at least partly, be due to confounding by smoking. This analysis provides the most precise estimates to date of mortality and cancer risks following occupational radiation exposure and strengthens the evidence for raised risks from these exposures. The cancer risk estimates are consistent with values used to set radiation protection standards.",Included

466,"Radiation-induced and transposon-induced chromosome damage in Drosophila: translocations and transmission distortion. The possible interaction between X-ray- and transposon-induced chromosome damage was monitored in the P-M system of hybrid dysgenesis in Drosophila melanogaster. One- to two-day-old F1 dysgenic males originating from a cross between M strain females and P strain males were irradiated with 5.5 Gy (550 rad) or used as controls to monitor X-Y translocations and transmission ratio distortion. Two 3-day sperm broods were sampled for the former and two 4-day broods for the latter to detect damage induced in the most radiosensitive cells. F1 nondysgenic males derived from M female to M male crosses (controls) were treated identically. X-Y chromosome translocations induced by P element mobility alone declined sharply with a decrease in temperature (18 versus 21 degrees C) and they were significantly reduced with aging of hybrid males from brood 2, 4-8 days of age, to brood 3, 7-11 days of age. No significant increase in translocations was observed when X irradiation and P-M dysgenesis were combined, showing no interaction between damages induced by the two mutator systems. In contrast, interaction was observed in transmission ratio distortion which was significantly increased by X irradiation of hybrid males derived from both reciprocal M X P and P x M crosses. The preferential elimination of P element-bearing autosomes occurred when either spermatocytes or spermatids were irradiated. An aging effect was also observed, resulting in less distortion in 9- to 14-day-old dysgenic males compared to 5- to 10-day-old hybrids.",Included
467,"The effects of radiation and dose-fractionation on cancer and non-tumor disease development. The Janus series of radiation experiments, conducted from 1970 to 1992, explored the effects of gamma and neutron radiation on animal lifespan and disease development. Data from these experiments presents an opportunity to conduct a large scale analysis of both tumor and non-tumor disease development. This work was focused on a subset of animals from the Janus series of experiments, comparing acute or fractionated exposures of gamma or neutron radiation on the hazards associated with the development of tumor and non-tumor diseases of the liver, lung, kidney or vascular system. This study also examines how the co-occurrence of non-tumor diseases may affect tumor-associated hazards. While exposure to radiation increases the hazard of dying with tumor and non-tumor diseases, dose fractionation modulates these hazards, which varies across different organ systems. Finally, the effect that concurrent non-cancer diseases have on the hazard of dying with a tumor also differs by organ system. These results highlight the complexity in the effects of radiation on the liver, lung, kidney and vascular system.",Included
488,"Online exhaled gas measurements for radiotherapy patients by proton transfer reaction mass spectrometry. The present study assessed whether exhaled breath analysis using proton transfer reaction mass spectrometry (PTR-MS) could screen for radiation exposure. As the intensity of proton transfer reaction reagent ion H3(16)O(+) can be calculated with the intensity of H3(18)O(+), the intensity of H3(18)O(+) was monitored to observe the stability of the PTR-MS instrument during the experiment. The PTR-MS was applied for detecting the volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in the exhaled breath from 42 radiotherapy patients and other 61 patients who had not received radiotherapy. All patients were enrolled in the local cancer hospital. In the experiment, the subjects breathe slowly to the PTR-MS through a direct inlet system without any sampling bag or tube. The breath mass spectrometric data was statistically analyzed using Mann-Whitney U test and stepwise discriminant analysis to find the characteristic ions of radiation exposure. Receiver operating characteristics (ROC) analysis was applied for a combination of the characteristic ions. The PTR-MS instrument was stable as the intensity of reaction ion H3(16)O(+) was maintained in 1.1%. Through statistically analysis, we found 6 kinds of characteristic ions of radiation exposure, specifically mass-to-charge ratio (m/z) 93, m/z 41, m/z 102, m/z 79, m/z 131, and m/z 143. The sensitivity (true positive rate) and specificity (true negative rate) were 78.6% and 82.0% respectively. The integrated area under the ROC curve (AUC) was 0.869. The results in our study demonstrated the potential of the online breath tester PTR-MS as a non-invasive screening for radiation exposure. Copyright © 2016. Published by Elsevier Ltd.",Included
505,"Glaucoma incidence risk in a cohort of Mayak PA workers occupationally exposed to ionizing radiation. Glaucoma is a major cause of visual impairment, and secondary glaucoma manifested as neovascular glaucoma has long been known to occur following high-dose fractionated radiation therapy. In contrast, little is known as to whether ionizing radiation exposure causes primary glaucoma, except that a single study in Japanese atomic bomb survivors has reported a significantly increase risk. Therefore, the effect of lower dose and lower dose rate remains unclear. Here we report that in Russian Mayak Production Association workers occupationally exposed to chronic radiation for prolonged periods, incidence of total primary glaucoma and primary open-angle glaucoma is significantly associated with various non-radiation factors (sex, attained age, and cataract diagnosed prior to glaucoma), but neither with cumulative dose from external gamma-rays nor with cumulative neutron dose nor with the unweighted sum of cumulative gamma and neutron doses. The present results suggest for the first time that chronic radiation exposure does not cause primary glaucoma, although the analyses need to be made in other cohorts exposed at various dose and dose rate.",Included

Plutonium-induced lung fibrosis was shown to have no association with cumulative lung absorbed dose from external gamma rays as of the date of diagnosis. On the contrary, the plutonium-induced lung fibrosis rate was shown to be associated with cumulative lung absorbed dose from incorporated alpha particles and to increase significantly with increasing dose from internal radiation exposure.

593,"Sonographic characterisation of radiation-induced carotid artery stenosis. BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: To study the distribution, extent and sonographic characterisation of radiation-induced carotid artery stenosis in nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) patients., METHODS: The distribution of plaques, the extent of stenosis, and the sonographic characterisation of the plaque at maximum stenosis were recorded in 71 NPC patients. The results were compared with the ultrasound results of a control group of 142 patients presenting with symptoms of cerebrovascular disease or carotid bruit., RESULTS: NPC patients had a higher incidence of carotid stenosis (77 vs. 50.7%). The common carotid arteries were most commonly affected by radiation-induced stenosis (93/142 vs. 37/284 in the control group), whereas the carotid bulb was the most commonly affected (56/284) site in the control group. Significantly more NPC patients had moderate-to-severe stenosis (21/71 vs. 27/142). Analysis of the sonographic appearance of radiation-induced and atherosclerotic plaques showed more diffuse involvement in the post-radiation group. Non-calcified plaques and intraplaque hypoechoic foci were also more frequent in the post-radiation group., CONCLUSIONS: Radiation-induced carotid stenosis is more diffuse in distribution, is associated with more severe luminal stenosis and has different sonographic plaque characterisation compared with carotid stenosis without radiation exposure.

613,"Suppression of experimental corneal angiogenesis by focal X-ray irradiation. PURPOSE: To investigate the effect of focal X-ray irradiation on experimental corneal angiogenesis in the rabbit., METHODS: A gelatin hydrogel sheet impregnated with basic fibroblast growth factor was implanted into the corneal stroma of rabbits; this induced corneal angiogenesis. After the first sign of corneal angiogenesis was noted, the corneal region was irradiated with a dose of 10 Gy or 20 Gy. The control rabbits received no irradiation. The eyes were examined by slitlamp biomicroscopy and photographed, over a period of 28 days. The maximum length and total surface area of corneal angiogenesis were quantified by computerized image analysis., RESULTS: Corneal angiogenesis was noted on day 3 following implantation of the hydrogel sheet. In the rabbits irradiated with 10 Gy, the maximum length and total surface area of corneal angiogenesis were both significantly lower on day 4 and 7 following irradiation, compared to the respective measurement in the controls. In the rabbits irradiated with 20 Gy, the maximum length and total surface area of corneal angiogenesis were significantly lower between days 4 and 21, and between days 4 and 14, respectively, compared to the respective measurement in the controls., CONCLUSIONS: Focal X-ray irradiation to the corneal region suppressed corneal angiogenesis in a dose-dependent manner.

BACKGROUND: The safety of gamma knife radiosurgery should be considered when treating pituitary adenomas., OBJECTIVES: To determine the maximum tolerated dose of radiation delivered by gamma knife radiosurgery to optic nerves., METHODS: An animal model designed to establish prolonged balloon compression of the optic chiasm and parasellar region was developed to mimic the optic nerve compression caused by pituitary adenomas. Twenty cats underwent surgery to place a balloon for compression effect and 20 cats in a sham operation group received microsurgery without any treatment. The effects of gamma knife irradiation at 10-13 Gy on normal (sham operation group) and compressed (optic nerve compression group) optic nerves were investigated by pattern visual evoked potential examination and histopathology., RESULTS: Gamma knife radiosurgery at 10 Gy had almost no effect. At 11 Gy, P100 latency was significantly prolonged and P100 amplitude was significantly decreased in compressed optic nerves, but there was little change in the normal optic nerves. Doses of 11 Gy and higher induced significant electrophysiological variations and degeneration of the myelin sheath and axons in both normal and compressed optic nerves., CONCLUSIONS: Compressed optic nerves are more sensitive to gamma knife radiosurgery than normal optic nerves. The minimum dose of gamma knife radiosurgery that causes radiation injury in normal optic nerves is 12 Gy; however, the minimum dose is 11 Gy in compressed optic nerves. Copyright © 2013 S.

647,"Randomized trial of 90Sr/90Y beta-radiation versus placebo control for treatment of in-stent restenosis. BACKGROUND: After conventional treatment of in-stent restenosis, the incidence of recurrent clinical restenosis may approach 40%. We report the first multicenter, blinded, and randomized trial of intracoronary radiation with the use of a 90Sr/90Y beta-source for the treatment of in-stent restenosis., METHODS AND RESULTS: After successful catheter-based treatment of in-stent restenosis, 476 patients were randomly assigned to receive an intracoronary catheter containing either 90Sr/90Y (n=244) or placebo (n=232) sources. The prescribed dose 2 mm from the center of the source was 18.4 Gy for vessels between 2.70 and 3.35 mm in diameter and 23.0 Gy for vessels between 3.36 and 4.0 mm. The primary end point, ie, clinically driven target-vessel revascularization by 8 months, was observed in 56 (26.8%) of the patients assigned to placebo and 39 (17.0%) of the patients assigned to radiation (P=0.015). The incidence of the composite including death, myocardial infarction, and target-vessel revascularization was observed in 60 (28.7%) of the patients assigned to placebo and 44 (19.1%) of the patients assigned to radiation (P=0.024). Binary 8-month angiographic restenosis (> or =50% diameter stenosis) within the entire segment treated with radiation was reduced from 45.2% in the placebo-treated patients to 28.8% in the 90Sr/90Y-treated patients (P=0.001). Stent thromboses occurred in 1 patient assigned to placebo <24 hours after the procedure and in 1 patient assigned to 90Sr/90Y at day 244., CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study demonstrated that beta-radiation using 90Sr/90Y is both safe and effective for preventing recurrence in patients with in-stent restenosis.",Included
656,"Gamma-radiation sensitivity and polymorphisms in RAD51L1 modulate glioma risk. BACKGROUND: DNA strand breaks pose the greatest threat to genomic stability. Genetically determined mutagen sensitivity predisposes individuals to a variety of cancers, including glioma. However, polymorphisms in DNA strand break repair genes that may determine mutagen sensitivity are not well studied in cancer risk, especially in gliomas., METHODS: We correlated genotype data for tag single-nucleotide polymorphisms (tSNPs) of DNA strand break repair genes with a gamma-radiation-induced mutagen sensitivity phenotype [expressed as mean breaks per cell (B/C)] in samples from 426 glioma patients. We also conducted analysis to assess joint and haplotype effects of single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) on mutagen sensitivity. We further validate our results in an independent external control group totaling 662 subjects., RESULTS: Of the 392 tSNPs examined, we found that mutagen sensitivity was modified by one tSNP in the EME2 gene and six tSNPs in the RAD51L1 gene (P < 0.01). Among the six RAD51L1 SNPs tested in the validation set, one (RAD51L1 rs2180611) was significantly associated with mutagen sensitivity (P = 0.025). Moreover, we found a significant dose-response relationship between the mutagen sensitivity and the number of adverse tSNP genotypes. Furthermore, haplotype analysis revealed that RAD51L1 haplotypes F-A (zero adverse allele) and F-E (six adverse alleles) exhibited the lowest (0.42) and highest (0.93) mean B/C values, respectively. A similar dose-response relationship also existed between the mutagen sensitivity and the number of adverse haplotypes., CONCLUSION: These results suggest that polymorphisms in and haplotypes of the RAD51L1 gene, which is involved in the double-strand break repair pathway, modulate gamma-radiation-induced mutagen sensitivity.",Included

670,"Diagnostic medical radiation in inflammatory bowel disease: Primum non-nocere?. Background and Aims Patients with Inflammatory Bowel disease (IBD) are frequently exposed to diagnostic medical radiation for the diagnosis and evaluation of their disease. Despite increasing awareness of the potentially serious downstream effects, few studies have quantified radiation exposure in IBD patients. Methods We conducted a retrospective review of 225 consecutive patients attending IBD clinics at our hospital. Clinical data including demographics, disease characteristics and therapy were obtained from case note and electronic patient record review. All incidences of diagnostic medical radiation from initial diagnosis until 30 June 2010 inclusive were recorded from case note and computerised radiology database system review. The radiation dose for each procedure was obtained from published tables from the Royal College of Radiologists, UK. Effective dose for each procedure was calculated by multiplying this value by the number of procedures during the study period. The sum of doses received was the cumulative effective dose. Results One hundred and two of the 225 IBD patients reviewed were female, 123 were male. The median age was 48 (Range 17-88) and mean disease duration 9.8 years. One hundred and four patients had Crohn's disease, 113 patients had ulcerative colitis and 8 patients had an indeterminate colitis. The mean and median cumulative effective radiation doses were 11.35 mSv and 5.12 mSv respectively. A cumulative radiation dose greater than 10 mSv was seen in 40.9% (92) patients and greater than 25 mSv in 12.9% (29) patients. In 9 patients the cumulative effective dose was greater than 50 mSv. Crohn's disease was associated with a higher cumulative effective dose with exposure exceeding 10 mSv in 60.6%, 25 mSv in 22.1% and 50 mSv in 8.7% patients respectively. CT imaging accounted for 43% and barium studies for 32% of the total cumulative effective dose exposure. Thirty-nine patients had small bowel magnetic resonance (MR) studies as an alternative to ionising radiation in the last 3 years. Conclusions Patients with IBD, particularly those with Crohn's disease are exposed to significant amounts of diagnostic medical radiation in their lifetime. The increased risk of cancer from cumulative radiation coupled with the inherent risk of colorectal malignancy in long standing IBD and the potential for immunomodulator drugs such as azathioprine to increase the risk of cancers (e.g. lymphoma) is of great clinical and public health concern. Clinicians must remain vigilant to these risks when evaluating these patients and radiation exposure should be minimised and when possible alternatives such as intestinal ultrasound and MR imaging should be preferred.",Included

The response to accelerated neon ions of human Nall melanomas growing in nude mice was measured by an in vitro colony-forming assay following in situ tumor irradiation in the midposition of a 10-cm extended-peak ionization region. Values of the relative biological effectiveness (RBE) for peak neon ions compared with 60Co gamma radiation were 3.2 and 3.4, respectively, at the 1% and 10% survival levels. Following irradiation with peak neon ions, the repair of potentially lethal damage (PLD) was comparable to that observed after gamma irradiation. When misonidazole (1 mg/g intraperitoneal dose) was administered in combination with extended-peak neon ions, the drug enhancement ratio (ER) at the 1% survival level was 1.5 if the tumors were removed and plated in vitro immediately following irradiation, and 1.9 if tumor excision and plating were delayed for greater than 6 hours.

NKG2D is a primary activating receptor that triggers cell-mediated cytotoxicity in NK cells against tumor and virus-infected cells. We previously identified the NKG2D haplotypes in the natural killer gene complex region on chromosome 12p. Two major haplotype alleles, LNK1 and HNK1, were closely related to low and high natural cytotoxic activity phenotypes, respectively. Furthermore, the haplotype of HNK1/HNK1 has revealed a decreased risk of cancer compared with LNK1/LNK1. In the present study, using flow cytometry, we evaluated the functional effects of NKG2D haplotypes and five htSNPs in terms of the cell-surface expression of NKG2D protein on NK and CD8 T cells of peripheral blood among 732 atomic-bomb survivors. NKG2D expression on NK cells showed significant increases, in the order of LNK1/LNK1, LNK1/HNK1 and HNK1/HNK1 haplotypes (p for trend = 0.003), or with major homozygous, heterozygous, and minor homozygous genotypes for individual htSNPs (p for trend = 0.02-0.003). The same trend was observed for NKG2D expression on CD8 T cells.

The 10 lymphoma lines included 7 previously characterized and reported in the literature. Significant differences with respect to both latency period for tumor appearance and success rate for tumor transplantation were detected among the 3 experimental groups. The unmanipulated mice were poor recipients for lymphoma heterotranplants, and tumors were produced in only two instances. In contrast, 6 tumor lines were successfully transplanted in mice inoculated with ALS, and all 10 lines were successfully transplanted in X-irradiated recipients. Although tumors were readily produced in ALS-treated and X-irradiated mice, no gross or histologic evidence of focal or distant metastases was apparent. Human lymphoblastoid cells were recultured, essentially unchanged, from the heterotransplants from 6 of 7 tumors tested. Although the tumor line HT 1460, originally from a human lymphoma, was successfully transplanted in all 3 groups, only mouse cells were recultured. The use of X-irradiation, rather than ALS, to immunosuppress nude mice offers a more standardized method for heterotransplanting human tumor cell lines and permits ready comparisons between laboratories. Furthermore X-radiation permits transplantation and subsequent study of lymphoblastoid tumors that are otherwise difficult to successfully transplant in nude mice.",Included

PURPOSE: Pooling of individual-level data for workers involved in uranium refining and processing (excluding enrichment) may provide valuable insights into risks from occupational uranium and external ionizing radiation exposures., METHODS: Data were pooled for workers from four uranium processing facilities (Fernald, Mallinckrodt and Middlesex from the U.S.; and Port Hope, Canada). Employment began as early as the 1930s and follow-up was as late as 2017. Workers were exposed to high concentrations of uranium, radium, and their decay products, as well as gamma radiation and ambient radon decay products. Exposure and outcome data were harmonized using similar definitions and dose reconstruction methods. Standardized mortality ratios (SMR) were estimated., RESULTS: In total, 560 deaths from lung cancer, 503 non-malignant respiratory diseases, 67 renal diseases, 1,596 ischemic heart diseases, and 101 dementia and Alzheimer's disease (AD) were detected in the pooled cohort of over 12,400 workers (~1,300 females).

OBJECTIVES: To provide direct estimates of risk of cancer after protracted low doses of ionising radiation and to strengthen the scientific basis of radiation protection standards for environmental, occupational, and medical diagnostic exposures., DESIGN: Multinational retrospective cohort study of cancer mortality., SETTING: Cohorts of workers in the nuclear industry in 15 countries., PARTICIPANTS: 407 391 workers individually monitored for external radiation with a total follow-up of 5.2 million person years., MAIN OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS: Estimates of excess relative risks per sievert (Sv) of radiation dose for mortality from cancers other than leukaemia and from leukaemia excluding chronic lymphocytic leukaemia, the main causes of death considered by radiation protection authorities., RESULTS: The excess relative risk for cancers other than leukaemia was 0.97 per Sv, 95% confidence interval 0.14 to 1.97. Analyses of causes of death related or unrelated to smoking indicate that, although confounding by smoking may be present, it is unlikely to explain all of this increased risk. The excess relative risk for leukaemia excluding chronic lymphocytic leukaemia was 1.93 per Sv (< 0 to 8.47). On the basis of these estimates, 1-2% of deaths from cancer among workers in this cohort may be attributable to radiation., CONCLUSIONS: These estimates, from the largest study of nuclear workers ever conducted, are higher than, but statistically compatible with, the risk estimates used for current radiation protection standards. The results suggest that there is a small excess risk of cancer, even at the low doses and dose rates typically received by nuclear workers in this study.",Included

743,"Low dose radiotherapy is associated with local complications but not disease control in sacral chordoma. BACKGROUND: We reviewed the disease control and complications of the treatment of sacrococcygeal chordoma from four tertiary cancer centers with emphasis on the effects of radiotherapy in surgically treated patients., METHODS: A total of 193 patients with primary sacrococcygeal chordoma from 1990 to 2015 were reviewed. There were 124 males, with a mean age of 59 +/- 15 years and a mean follow-up of 7 +/- 4 years. Eighty-nine patients received radiotherapy with a mean total dose of 61.8 +/- 10.9 Gy., RESULTS: The 10-year disease-free and disease-specific survival was 58% and 72%, respectively. Radiation was not associated with local recurrence (hazard ratio [HR], 1.13; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.59-2.17; P = 0.71), metastases (HR, 0.93; 95% CI, 0.45-1.91; P = 0.85) or disease-specific survival (HR, 0.96; 95% CI, 0.46-2.00; P = 0.91). Higher doses (>=70 Gy; HR, 0.52; 95% CI, 0.20-1.32; P = 0.17) may be associated with reduced local recurrence.

Purpose: A dose-response study was performed in swine to investigate the vascular effects of 32P over a broad range of doses in order to define the therapeutic window of intracoronary radiotherapy (ICR) with 32P. Methods and Materials: A total of 131 porcine arteries were subjected to balloon injury or stenting followed by 0-36 Gy of ICR from a centered 32P source wire to 1 mm beyond lumen surface or a sham ICR procedure. Animals were euthanized at 4 weeks, and vessels were harvested for histomorphometry. Result(s): In the balloon-injured arteries, doses of 7 and 9 Gy did not impact restenosis. At doses of 14-36 Gy, neointima was markedly reduced, with mild dilatation at the highest dose, 36 Gy. In the stent-injured arteries, the lowest dose of 9 Gy failed to reduce neointimal growth, while 14-26 Gy showed the most favorable response. Conclusion(s): ICR with 32P features a broad therapeutic window. Doses of 14-26 Gy to 1 mm beyond lumen surface provided an optimal combination of efficacy and safety. Doses of 7 and 9 Gy were generally ineffective, suggesting a minimum threshold for ICR with 32P to effectively inhibit restenosis. Copyright © 2002 Elsevier Science Inc.",Included
756,"Increased oxidative stress in barn swallows from the Chernobyl region. The Chernobyl nuclear accident produced the largest unintended release of radionuclides in history, with dramatic consequences for humans and other organisms. Exposure to ionizing radiation is known to reduce circulating and stored levels of specific antioxidants in birds and humans, thus potentially increasing oxidative stress. However, overall effects of radioactive exposure on oxidative status have never been investigated in any free ranging vertebrate. We measured plasma antioxidant capacity and concentration of reactive oxygen metabolites in adult barn swallows (Hirundo rustica) from colonies with variable background radiation levels in the Chernobyl region in Ukraine and Belarus. We predicted that antioxidants would decrease while reactive oxygen metabolites would increase with exposure to increasing levels of radiation at the breeding sites. Consistent with this expectation, radiation level positively predicted plasma concentration of reactive oxygen metabolites, whereas no significant covariation was found with non-enzymatic plasma antioxidant capacity. An index of oxidative stress was also larger in barn swallows exposed to high contamination levels. Thus, radioactive contamination appeared to be responsible for the increased generation of reactive oxygen metabolites and the imbalance between reactive oxygen metabolites and non-enzymatic plasma antioxidant capacity.",Included
772,"Evaluating the radioprotective effect of Cimetidine, IMOD, and hybrid radioprotectors agents: An in-vitro study. INTRODUCTION: There are various radioprotective agents with different mechanisms that help to decrease ionizing radiation side effects. The radioprotective effect of Cimetidine and IMOD was assessed individually and compared with the hybrid radioprotectors agents (HRPAs-IMOD and Cimetidine) on human lymphocyte cells., METHODS: Twenty healthy volunteers (ten men and ten women) participated in the present study. About 75 mL peripheral blood lymphocytes from each individual were collected, and they were divided into 36 groups. Briefly, the blood samples were treated with different concentrations of Cimetidine (12.6 and 25.2 mug/mL) and IMOD (0.04, 0.08, and 0.12 mg/mL), and also a combination of these agents, namely hybrid radioprotectors agents (HRPAs). Besides, the irradiated groups were exposed to 2 and 4 Gy of Co-60 gamma irradiation. The amount of cellular damage was assessed using the micronucleus assay. The repeated measurements and paired T-test statistical analysis were used to compare the micronucleus frequencies in different groups., RESULTS: The micronucleus frequencies were significantly reduced (p < 0.05) in irradiated groups when the non-toxic concentrations of Cimetidine, IMOD, and HRPAs have been used. The reduction in micronucleus frequency was obtained 5-29% for Cimetidine and 40-51% for IMOD in peripheral blood lymphocytes irradiated with 2 Gy. This reduction in 4 Gy irradiation was 8-17% for Cimetidine and 27-37% for IMOD. The HRPAs resulted in a higher radioprotective effect, in a way that they cause up to 58% and 43% micronucleus frequency reduction in 2 and 4 Gy, respectively., CONCLUSION: In conclusion, the HRPAs showed the highest level of radioprotective. In addition, IMOD was remarkably higher radioprotective than Cimetidine, which may be related to its greater non-toxic concentrations. Copyright © 2021 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",Included
795,"Incidence of dementia among atomic-bomb survivors--Radiation Effects Research Foundation Adult Health Study. Radiotherapy has been reported to cause neuropsychological dysfunction. Here we examined whether exposure to atomic bomb radiation affected the incidence of dementia among 2286 atomic bomb survivors and controls - all members of the Adult Health Study cohort. Study subjects were non-demented and aged >or=60 years at baseline examination and had been exposed in 1945 at >or=13 years of age to a relatively low dose (<or=4 Gy), compared with total dose from radiotherapy. Dementia diagnoses were made during biennial health examinations with a two-phase procedure. DSM IV criteria were used for diagnosing dementia, NINCDS-ADRDA for Alzheimer disease, and NINDS-AIREN for vascular disease. To estimate the effect of radiation on the dementia incidence rate, we applied Poisson regression analysis. Incidence per 1000 person-years was 16.3 in the <5 mGy group, 17.0 in the 5-499 mGy group, and 15.2 in the >or=500 mGy group. Alzheimer disease was the predominant type of dementia in each dose category. After adjustment for potential risk factors, radiation exposure did not affect the incidence rate of either all dementia or any of its subtypes. No case of dementia had a history of therapeutic cranial irradiation. Although we found no relationship between radiation exposure and the development of dementia among atomic bomb survivors exposed at >or=13 years old in this longitudinal study, effects on increased risk of early death among atomic bomb survivors will be considered.",Included

828,"Late effects in ankylosing spondylitis patients treated with 224Ra. This study is comprised of 1577 ankylosing spondylitis patients from 9 German hospitals who have been treated with multiple injections of 224Ra. The majority of the patients, most of them treated in the years 1948-1975, received one series of 10 weekly intravenous injections of about 1 MBq of 224Ra each. This dose leads to a mean absorbed dose due to alpha-particle radiation of 0.56 Gy to the marrow-free skeleton of a 70-kg man (mean bone surface dose of about 5 Gy). To provide comparative information on causes of death and on health effects possibly related to the basic disease itself, a control group of 1462 ankylosing spondylitis patients with roughly the same age distribution has been established. By the end of 1998, 649 patients in the exposed group and 762 control patients had died. Among other observations, it is of particular interest that 13 cases of leukemia in the exposed group have been observed. This is a highly significant excess (P < 0.001) compared to a standard population, but only a marginally significant excess in comparison to the seven cases observed in the control group. Subclassification of the leukemias shows a clear preponderance of the myeloid leukemias in the exposed group (8 cases observed compared to 1.7 cases expected, P < 0.001), whereas in the control group the observed cases are within the expected range for myeloid leukemia (3 cases observed compared to 2.2 cases expected, P = 0.3). The 224Ra cohort of the earlier study (higher-dose group) has provided a risk coefficient that predicts about 8 excess malignant bone tumors for the irradiated cohort in this study.

OBJECTIVES: This study sought to assess the association between long-term radiation exposure in the catheterization laboratory (cath lab) and early signs of subclinical atherosclerosis. BACKGROUND: There is growing evidence of an excess risk of cardiovascular disease at low-dose levels of ionizing radiation exposure. METHODS: Left and right carotid intima-media thickness (CIMT) was measured in 223 cath lab personnel (141 male; age, 45 +/- 8 years) and 222 unexposed subjects (113 male; age, 44+/-10 years). Leukocyte telomere length (LTL) was evaluated by quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction. The DNA repair gene XRCC3 Thr241Met polymorphism was also analyzed to explore the possible interaction with radiation exposure. The occupational radiological risk score (ORRS) was computed for each subject on the basis of the length of employment, individual caseload, and proximity to the radiation source. A complete lifetime effective dose (mSv) was recorded for 57 workers. RESULTS: Left, right, and averaged CIMTs were significantly increased in high-exposure workers compared with both control subjects and low-exposure workers (all p values<0.04). On the left side, but not on the right, there was a significant correlation between CIMT and ORRS (p=0.001) as well as lifetime dose (p=0.006). LTL was significantly reduced in exposed workers compared with control subjects (p=0.008). There was a significant correlation between LTL and both ORRS (p=0.002) and lifetime dose (p=0.03). The XRCC3 Met241 allele presented a significant interaction with high exposure for right side (pinteraction=0.002), left side (pinteraction<0.0001), and averaged (pinteraction<0.0001) CIMTs.

856,"Gamma irradiation. An effective procedure for bone banks, but does it make sense from an osteobiological perspective?. BACKGROUND: Bone grafts promote bone healing by supplying a three-dimensional structure that supports bone ingrowth. Autologous bone therefore still remains the ""gold standard"" for grafts. Unfortunately, autologous bone grafts are associated with an increased morbidity. In order to avoid such problems, intensive research has been carried out on alternative materials such as allogeneic bone. However, its use is dependent on bone banks and its availability is limited. Gamma irradiation is now becoming established as a procedure for inactivating bacteria, fungal spores and viruses. Its effects on the biomechanical properties of bone have been analyzed in numerous studies. However, the current literature provides little information as to the effects of gamma sterilization on the osteobiology of allogeneic bone grafts., PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effect of gamma-sterilized bone grafts on immunocompetent cells by an in vitro model (a culture of human bone marrow cells)., METHODS: We decided to use the model of human bone marrow cells in culture for the in vitro analysis because the physiological conditions in the human body can best be simulated in this model and the observed reactions are applicable to humans., RESULTS AND INTERPRETATION: In sum, we found a maximum immune response in gamma-irradiated bone grafts, which, interpreted as a sole result, must be seen as a negative biological effect. However, in view of the good clinical results for gamma-sterilized bone grafts other influences would seem to be the determining factors in clinical outcome. Further research is needed to gain a more exact understanding of these factors.",Included
904,"Collaborative exercise on the use of FISH chromosome painting for retrospective biodosimetry of Mayak nuclear-industrial personnel. PURPOSE: To investigate within the framework of a multilaboratory study the suitability of FISH chromosome painting to measure so-called stable translocations in peripheral lymphocytes of Mayak nuclear-industrial workers (from the Southern Urals) and their use for retrospective biodosimetry., MATERIALS AND METHODS: Chromosime analyses were carried out from 69 workers who had received protracted occupational radiation exposures (0.012-6.065 Gy) up to approximately 40 years before blood sampling. Twenty-one unexposed people living in the same area were controls. A multicolour FISH-painting protocol with the target chromosomes 1, 4 and 8 simultaneously with a pancentromeric probe was used to score potentially transmissible chromosome-type aberrations (reciprocal translocations 2B and related 'one-way' patterns I-III according to the S&S classification)., RESULTS: Individual biodosimetry estimates were obtained in terms of these potentially long-term surviving aberration types based on the linear component of a low dose-rate gamma-ray calibration curve produced using identical staining and scoring protocols. For comparison, the workers personal and total background doses were converted to red bone marrow doses. The estimated doses were mainly lower than would be predicted by the calibration curve, particularly at accumulated higher dose levels., CONCLUSIONS: Owing to the limited life-time of circulating T-lymphocytes, the long-term persistence of translocations in vivo requires the assumption of a clonal repopulation of these naturally senescing cells from the haemopoietic stem cell compartments. Obviously such a replacement cannot be fully achieved, leading to a temporal decline even of the yield of transmissible aberrations types. Assuming further a highly selective capacity of stem cells against any type of chromosomal damage and the fact that one must rely on partial genome findings, the potential of FISH chromosome painting for retrospective dose reconstruction is probably limited to a decade or so after high-level protracted radiation exposure.",Included
909,"Heterogeneity in the clastogenic response to X-rays in lymphocytes from ataxia-telangiectasia heterozygotes and controls. A coded analysis of X-ray-induced chromatid aberrations in lymphocyte cultures from 45 control individuals and 19 ataxia-telangiectasia (A-T) heterozygotes was performed. The distribution of chromatid breaks induced in the late G2 portion of the cell cycle by 60 cGy of X-rays appeared bimodal in the study population. In six controls (13 percent) and in 12 of 19 (63 percent) A-T heterozygotes, the yields of X-ray-induced breaks observed were within the higher mode of the distribution. However, lymphocytes from A-T heterozygotes sensitive to the induction of chromatid breaks by 60 cGy did not contain increased numbers of aberrations following exposure to 20 cGy. The radio-resistant inhibition of DNA synthesis that occurs in A-T homozygotes was not observed in heterozygotes. Co-cultivation experiments showed an increased G2 delay in lymphocytes from an A-T heterozygote whose lymphocytes contained increased X-ray-induced chromatid breaks. The results show a significant association of A-T heterozygosity with G2 chromosomal sensitivity (P less than 0.001; Wilcoxon rank sum test). The measurement of X-ray-induced breaks, however, failed to identify 37 percent of A-T heterozygotes tested. The predicted prevalence of increased sensitivity to X-rays in controls is approximately three- to 30-fold greater than the estimated frequency of A-T heterozygotes in the general population. Therefore, although the increased sensitivity to X-ray-induced chromatid breaks appears to be associated with the A-T-gene, it is not a reliable indicator of A-T heterozygosity. Genetic or environmental factors other than the A-T gene also must be involved in the increased clastogenic response.",Included
918,"Increased radiation from Chernobyl decreases the expression of red colouration in natural populations of bank voles (Myodes glareolus). Pheomelanin is a pink to red version of melanin pigment deposited in skin and hair. Due to its bright colour, pheomelanin plays a crucial function in signalling, in particular sexual signalling. However, production of pheomelanin, as opposed to its dark alternative, eumelanin, bears costs in terms of consumption of antioxidants important for protection of DNA against naturally produced reactive oxidative species. Therefore, decreased expression of pheomelanin is expected in organisms exposed to severe oxidative stress such as that caused by exposure to chronic ionizing radiation. We tested if variable exposure to radiation among natural populations of bank voles Myodes glareolus in Chernobyl affected expression of red colouration in their dorsal fur. The relative redness of dorsal fur was positively correlated with weight, but also negatively correlated with the level of background radiation. These results suggest that the development of the natural red colouration in adult bank voles is affected by ionizing background radiation, and potentially causing elevated levels of oxidative stress. Reduced production of pheomelanin allows more antioxidants to mitigate the oxidative stress caused by radiation. However, changing natural animal colouration for physiological reasons can have ecological costs, if e.g. it causes mismatch with habitat colouration and conspicuousness for predators.",Included

Objective: Incidence and mortality from ischaemic heart disease (IHD) was studied in an extended cohort of 22,377 workers first employed at the Mayak Production Association during 1948-82 and followed up to the end of 2008. Method(s): Relative risks and excess relative risks per unit dose (ERR/Gy) were calculated based on the maximum likelihood using Epicure software (Hirosoft International Corporation, Seattle, WA). Dose estimates used in analyses were provided by an updated ""Mayak Worker Dosimetry System-2008"". Result(s): A significant increasing linear trend in IHD incidence with total dose from external g-rays was observed after having adjusted for non-radiation factors and dose from internal radiation {ERR/Gy50.10 [95% confidence interval (CI): 0.04 to 0.17]}. The pure quadratic model provided a better fit of the data than did the linear one. No significant association of IHD mortality with total dose from external g-rays after having adjusted for nonradiation factors and dose from internal alpha radiation was observed in the study cohort [ERR/Gy50.06 (95% CI: ,0 to 0.15)]. A significant increasing linear trend was observed in IHD mortality with total absorbed dose from internal alpha radiation to the liver after having adjusted for non-radiation factors and dose from external g-rays in both the whole cohort [ERR/Gy50.21 (95% CI: 0.01 to 0.58)] and the subcohort of workers exposed at alpha dose ,1.00Gy [ERR/Gy51.08 (95% CI: 0.34 to 2.15)]. No association of IHD incidence with total dose from internal alpha radiation to the liver was found in the whole cohort after having adjusted for non-radiation factors and external gamma dose [ERR/Gy50.02 (95% CI: not available to 0.10)].

Ninety-four patients (46 patients having abdominoperineal resections (APR), and 48 having anterior resections) did not receive radiation therapy. Sixty-one patients had preoperative radiation therapy followed by APR in 59 cases. Univariate analysis showed that the risk of local recurrence increased significantly with male sex (p less than 0.006), positive lymph nodes (p less than 0.01), vascular invasion (p less than 0.02), and Astler-Coller classification (p less than 0.05). Tumor located at less than 5 cm from the anal verge was significantly related to recurrence only in patients not receiving radiation therapy (p less than 0.02). Multivariate analysis including therapeutic modalities showed that local recurrence was significantly related with male sex (p less than 0.02), positive lymph nodes (p less than 0.01), and distance to anal verge (p less than 0.01). The beneficial role of radiation therapy appeared only for tumors located 5 cm or less from the anal verge. Prognostic scores were established using these variables and the effect of irradiation was evaluated according to these scores.

Although there are considerable functional and genetic data on the regulation of apoptosis in vitro and in model organisms, little is known about how these pathways are modified in primary cells freshly isolated from people, who are continually subjected to a variety of different and often unquantified environmental stimuli. We hypothesize that these exposures may have important and as yet unappreciated modifying effects on apoptosis that may have implications for cancer risk or response to therapy. To test this, we isolated peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from 90 normal healthy individuals and treated them with 5 Gy ionizing radiation (IR). Damage-induced apoptosis was measured at 24 hours after IR by TUNEL. We observed surprising heterogeneity in apoptosis among individuals, ranging from 21-65 percent. To determine whether this diversity in response was programmed or stochastic, we repeated the experiment 3 times in 10 individuals spanning the entire IR-induced apoptotic range and found results to be completely reproducible within individuals, suggesting that it resulted from a genetic program. We then assessed the association with individual characteristics. Whereas neither race nor age was associated with IR-induced apoptosis, gender was significantly associated (Mean: 44.8% vs 32.9%; p = 1.02 x 10-8). Moreover, when stratified by gender, age was significantly associated with IR-induced apoptosis in males (p = 0.026) but not females (p = 0.94). Thus, we conclude that IR-induced apoptosis in freshly isolated human PBMCs results from an intrinsic genetic program modified by age, but only within males.

We now demonstrate that SOD is involved in the resistance of Drosophila melanogaster against irradiation. The protection is greatest when flies carry the S form of the enzyme (which exhibits highest in vitro specific activity), intermediate when they carry the F form of the enzyme, and lowest when they are homozygous for N, an allele that reduces the amount of the enzyme to 3.5% of the normal level. Natural selection experiments show that the fitness of the high-activity S allele is increased in an irradiated population relative to the nonirradiated control.

The most common aberrations in the contralateral tissues and those from nonirradiated mice were chromatid and isochromatid breaks and small chromatid fragments. Primary cells from irradiated tissues removed from animals within a month of exposure displayed a variety of unstable chromosome-type aberrations characteristic of recent exposure to ionizing radiation including rings, dicentrics, double minutes, and large acentric fragments. The percentages of cells exhibiting chromatid breaks and small chromatid fragments were also markedly elevated. Although the levels of chromosome-type aberrations found in primary cells from irradiated tissues dropped to near background levels a year or more after exposure, chromatid-type aberrations remained elevated. These results are consistent with long-term persistence of damage in the genomes of ionizing radiation-exposed cells in solid tissues and the induction of genomic instability in vivo.",Included

CONTEXT: Ionizing radiation is a well-established risk factor for brain tumors. During recent years, microwave exposure from the use of cellular telephones has been discussed as a potential risk factor., OBJECTIVE: To determine risk factors for brain tumors., DESIGN: A case-control study, with exposure assessed by questionnaires., PARTICIPANTS: A total of 233 currently living men and women, aged 20 to 80 years, were included. The case patients had histopathologically verified brain tumors and lived in the Uppsala-Orebro region (1994-1996) or the Stockholm region (1995-1996). Two matched controls to each case were selected from the Swedish Population Register., MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Ionizing radiation and use of cellular telephones as risk factors for brain tumors., RESULTS: A total of 209 cases (90%) and 425 controls (91%) answered the questionnaire. Work as a physician yielded an odds ratio (OR) of 6.00, with a 95% confidence interval (CI) of 0.62 to 57.7. All three case patients had worked with fluoroscopy. Radiotherapy of the head and neck region yielded an OR of 3.61 (95% CI, 0.65-19.9). Medical diagnostic x-ray examination of the same area yielded an OR of 2.10 (95% CI, 1.25-3.53), with a tumor induction period of 5 years or more.

1005,"Mortality from diseases other than cancer following low doses of ionizing radiation: results from the 15-Country Study of nuclear industry workers. BACKGROUND: Ionizing radiation at very high (radio-therapeutic) dose levels can cause diseases other than cancer, particularly heart diseases. There is increasing evidence that doses of the order of a few sievert (Sv) may also increase the risk of non-cancer diseases. It is not known, however, whether such effects also occur following the lower doses and dose rates of public health concern., METHODS: We used data from an international (15-country) nuclear workers cohort study to evaluate whether mortality from diseases other than cancer is related to low doses of external ionizing radiation. Analyses included 275 312 workers with adequate information on socioeconomic status, over 4 million person-years of follow-up and an average cumulative radiation dose of 20.7 mSv; 11 255 workers had died of non-cancer diseases., RESULTS: The excess relative risk (ERR) per Sv was 0.24 [95% CI (confidence intervals) -0.23, 0.78] for mortality from all non-cancer diseases and 0.09 (95% CI -0.43, 0.70) for circulatory diseases. Higher risk estimates were observed for mortality from respiratory and digestive diseases, but confidence intervals included zero. Increased risks were observed among the younger workers (attained age <50 years, identified post hoc) for all groupings of non-cancer causes of death, including external causes. It is unclear therefore whether these findings reflect real effects of radiation, random variation or residual confounding., CONCLUSIONS: The most informative low-dose radiation study to date provides little evidence for a relationship between mortality from non-malignant diseases and radiation dose. However, we cannot rule out risks per unit dose of the same order of magnitude as found in studies at higher doses.",Included
1026,"Recurrent Atypical Meningiomas: Combining Surgery and Radiosurgery in One Effective Multimodal Treatment. Objective Owing to their rarity and proteiform pathologic features, the clinical behavior of atypical meningiomas is not yet well characterized. Though the extent of resection is believed to be a key determinant of prognosis, limited data exist regarding optimal management of patients with recurrent disease. Methods In this 20-year retrospective case series, we reviewed the medical records of 46 patients with recurrent atypical meningomas (185 lesions, 89 of which were local, 78 marginal, and 18 distant recurrences); treatment was radiosurgery (n = 60), surgery (n = 56), or both (n = 8). The median follow-up period was 53 months. Outcome measures were length of overall survival and disease-free intervals and prognostic factors for survival. Results Overall, the median progression-free survival was 26 months at the first recurrence and 100 months thereafter (the sum of the later intervals). Multivariate analysis showed that no treatment-related factors influenced prognosis, whereas recurrence at the skull base was a significant tumor-related factor limiting further treatment. Irrespective of treatment type, the recurrence-free interval was increasingly shorter during the clinical course, with a higher occurrence of marginal and distant lesions migrating to the midline and to the skull base. In sporadic cases, disease-free intervals were longer after wide craniotomy, tumor and dural resection with tumor-free margin. Conclusions The disease-free interval was substantially similar after surgery and radiosurgery for treating recurrent disease in patients with atypical meningiomas. Surgery is the mainstay for prolonging survival, while radiosurgery can be an adjuvant strategy to gain time for clinical observation and planning aggressive surgical treatment.Copyright © 2016 Elsevier Inc.

1056,"Generation of a Transcriptional Radiation Exposure Signature in Human Blood Using Long-Read Nanopore Sequencing. In the event of a large-scale event leading to acute ionizing radiation exposure, high-throughput methods would be required to assess individual dose estimates for triage purposes. Blood-based gene expression is a broad source of biomarkers of radiation exposure which have great potential for providing rapid dose estimates for a large population. Time is a crucial component in radiological emergencies and the shipment of blood samples to relevant laboratories presents a concern. In this study, we performed nanopore sequencing analysis to determine if the technology can be used to detect radiation-inducible genes in human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). The technology offers not only long-read sequencing but also a portable device which can overcome issues involving sample shipment, and provide faster results. For this goal, blood from nine healthy volunteers was 2 Gy ex vivo X irradiated. After PBMC isolation, irradiated samples were incubated along with the controls for 24 h at 37degreeC. RNA was extracted, poly(A)+ enriched and reverse-transcribed before sequencing. The data generated was analyzed using a Snakemake pipeline modified to handle paired samples. The sequencing analysis identified a radiation signature consisting of 46 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) which included 41 protein-coding genes, a long non-coding RNA and four pseudogenes, five of which have been identified as radiation-responsive transcripts for the first time. The genes in which transcriptional expression is most significantly modified after radiation exposure were APOBEC3H and FDXR, presenting a 25-and 28-fold change on average, respectively. These levels of transcriptional response were comparable to results we obtained by quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) analysis. In vivo exposure analyses showed a transcriptional radioresponse at 24 h postirradiation for both genes together with a strong dose-dependent response in blood irradiated ex vivo. Finally, extrapolating from the data we obtained, the minimum sequencing time required to detect an irradiated sample using APOBEC3H transcripts would be less than 3 min for a total of 50,000 reads. Future improvements, in sample processing and bioinformatic pipeline for specific radiation-responsive transcript identification, will allow the provision of a portable, rapid, real-time biodosimetry platform based on this new sequencing technology. In summary, our data show that nanopore sequencing can identify radiation-responsive genes and can also be used for identification of new transcripts.Copyright © 2020 by Radiation Research Society.

Localized radiation therapy is well tolerated in cats with confined tumors; however, the use of wide-field radiation therapy to treat disseminated neoplasia has not been evaluated systematically in this species. Wide-field external beam radiation therapy, which we define as irradiation of cranial or caudal halves of the body either individually or sequentially, was undertaken as an experimental option to treat cats with either chemotherapy-refractory or naive hematopoietic neoplasia considered to have a poor prognosis. Fifteen cats with hematopoietic malignancies received wide-field external beam radiation therapy between 2003 and 2006. Cats received 8Gy delivered in 4Gy fractions with 60Co photons. Treatment-related toxicity was scored according to criteria established by the Veterinary Cooperative Oncology Group. Animals without preexisting abnormalities on hemograms exhibited no or mild (Grade 1 or 2) hematopoietic toxicity. Although most cats (14 of 15) had preexisting gastrointestinal (GI) signs, these signs were stable (29%) or improved (42%) following irradiation. Worsening GI signs following irradiation occurred transiently in two cats and in association with progressive disease in two others. No pulmonary, renal, hepatic, or dermatologic toxicities were detected. In summary, wide-field external beam radiation therapy can be administered safely to, and may provide therapeutic benefit for, cats with disseminated hematopoietic neoplasia. © 2010 Veterinary Radiology & Ultrasound.",Included

1103,"Solid cancer mortality associated with chronic external radiation exposure at the french atomic energy commission and nuclear fuel company. Studies of nuclear workers make it possible to directly quantify the risks associated with ionizing radiation exposure at low doses and low dose rates. Studies of the CEA (Commissariat l'Energie Atomique) and AREVA Nuclear Cycle (AREVA NC) cohort, currently the most informative such group in France, describe the long-term risk to nuclear workers associated with external exposure. Our aim is to assess the risk of mortality from solid cancers among CEA and AREVA NC nuclear workers and its association with external radiation exposure. Standardized mortality ratios (SMRs) were calculated and internal Poisson regressions were conducted, controlling for the main confounding factors sex, attained age, calendar period, company and socioeconomic status (SES). During the period 19682004, there were 2,035 solid cancers among the 36,769 CEA-AREVA NC workers. Cumulative external radiation exposure was assessed for the period 19502004, and the mean cumulative dose was 12.1 mSv. Mortality rates for all causes and all solid cancers were both significantly lower in this cohort than in the general population. A significant excess of deaths from pleural cancer, not associated with cumulative external dose, was observed, probably due to past asbestos exposure. We observed a significant excess of melanoma, also unassociated with dose. Although cumulative external dose was not associated with mortality from all solid cancers, the central estimated excess relative risk (ERR) per Sv of 0.46 for solid cancer mortality was higher than the 0.26 calculated for male Hiroshima and Nagasaki A-bomb survivors 50 years or older and exposed at the age of 30 years or older. The modification of our results after stratification for SES demonstrates the importance of this characteristic in occupational studies, because it makes it possible to take class-based lifestyle differences into account, at least partly. These results show the great potential of a further joint international study of nuclear workers, which should improve knowledge about the risks associated with chronic low doses and provide useful risk estimates for radiation protection. © 2011 by Radiation Research Society.",Included
1111,"Elevated mortality among birds in Chernobyl as judged from skewed age and sex ratios. BACKGROUND: Radiation has negative effects on survival of animals including humans, although the generality of this claim is poorly documented under low-dose field conditions. Because females may suffer disproportionately from the effects of radiation on survival due to differences in sex roles during reproduction, radiation-induced mortality may result in male-skewed adult sex ratios., METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDING: We estimated the effects of low-dose radiation on adult survival rates in birds by determining age ratios of adults captured in mist nets during the breeding season in relation to background radiation levels around Chernobyl and in nearby uncontaminated control areas. Age ratios were skewed towards yearlings, especially in the most contaminated areas, implying that adult survival rates were reduced in contaminated areas, and that populations in such areas could only be maintained through immigration from nearby uncontaminated areas. Differential mortality in females resulted in a strongly male-skewed sex ratio in the most contaminated areas. In addition, males sang disproportionately commonly in the most contaminated areas where the sex ratio was male skewed presumably because males had difficulty finding and acquiring mates when females were rare. The results were not caused by permanent emigration by females from the most contaminated areas because none of the recaptured birds had changed breeding site, and the proportion of individuals with morphological abnormalities did not differ significantly between the sexes for areas with normal and higher levels of contamination., CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: These findings are consistent with the hypothesis that the adult survival rate of female birds is particularly susceptible to the effects of low-dose radiation, resulting in male skewed sex ratios at high levels of radiation. Such skewed age ratios towards yearlings in contaminated areas are consistent with the hypothesis that an area exceeding 30,000 km(2) in Chernobyl's surroundings constitutes an ecological trap that causes dramatic excess mortality.",Included

The frequency of translocation, dicentrics (DC) and micronuclei (MN) was studied in blood samples exposed in vitro to 60Co gamma radiation and cervical cancer patients undergoing fractionated radiotherapy. The samples exposed under in vitro condition showed that the frequency of translocation and dicentric followed Poisson distribution ('u' varied between -0.04 and +1.41 for translocation and between -0.09 and +1.81 for DC) and that obtained with MN follow over dispersion ('u' varied between +2.04 and +9.28). However, the cervical cancer patients undergoing radiotherapy showed over dispersion for all these three aberrations (DC, MN and translocation). The frequencies of aberrations obtained in cancer patients were found to be lower than those obtained for in vitro exposure for doses more than 2 Gy equivalent whole body dose (EWBD). The dose-response curves were constructed using the frequencies of DC, MN and translocation as a function of EWBD. Doses as measured from the dose response curves were compared with the estimated dose in order to check whether the measured and estimated doses agree. The percent variation between the doses measured from aberration frequencies and that of the estimated dose was lower with translocation (10.8+/-7.41%) compared to those obtained with DC (38.08+/-31.85%) and MN (47.19+/-31.80%).

The results of the examination and monitoring of the personnel at the Siberian Chemical Plant (SChP) and adult population of Seversk are presented. The results of primary examination of the personnel who professionally contact the ionizing radiation (IR) from external sources and incorporated 239Pu showed that clinical symptoms of dysfunction of the immune system manifested themselves with a frequency of 75.30%. Infectious-inflammatory diseases (46.95%) and the combined pathology of infectious and allergic character (20.12%) were the most widespread. The allergic diseases (AD) without manifestations of an infectious component were observed not often (7.62%). The monitoring which was carried out for 10 years revealed a decrease in a percentage of persons with clinical signs of disorders of the immune system up to 60.68% among the personnel at the Chemical-Steel Plant and even more among the whole group of the studied personnel at SChP--49.68% (389 : 783). Among the population their frequency made up 51.78%. Features of clinical manifestations of dysfunction ofthe immune system depending on accumulation of 239Pu in the organism are established. Similar dynamics of infectious and infectious and allergic syndromes is revealed when the activity of 239Pu is 40 nCi. AD frequency reliably increased .when the activity of 239Pu is 20 nCi, but if accumulation is higher than 20-40 nCi it decreases and again increases when the activity is over 40 nCi. Pathologies of infectious and allergic genesis are most often observed when the content of 239Pu in an organism is over 40 nCi. Indicators of the immune status (IS) of the personnel at SChP with incorporated 239Pu are analyzed. 59 people--carriers of 239Pu and 408 people without 239Pu accumulated in an organism are examined. In comparison with the control, IS indicators characteristic for all dose loading groups are revealed: increase of lymphocytes, existence of dissociation in indicators of relative and absolute values of the T-cellular link, CD16+56+(-) NK-cells and B-lymphocytes with increase of absolute values, decrease in markers of activation of HLA-DR+ and CD95+, increase of B-lymphocytes and low level of serum IgM. Features of IS in comparison with the group of the personnel with the absence of 239Pu in an organism and indicators of IS which depend on the activity of 239Pu are established. Among them are a decrease in the percentage of persons with increased number of lymphocytes with increased beam loading; increase of NK-T-cells when the activity of 239Pu is 10-20 nCi and the highest value at doses over40 nCi; the dynamics of CD16+56(+)-lymphocytes with the increase of the contents and a percentage of persons with the increase of the activity above 40 nCi; the highest frequenc of a regulatory imbalance with high frequency decrease of CD8(+)-T-lymphocytes at the content of 239Pu > 0-10 nCi; decrease in indicators of B-lymphocytes and serum IgA with an increase in the activity of 239Pu with the lowest values under internal radiation over 40 nCi; decrease in the percentage of persons with a weakening expression of HLA-DR+ with the increase in dose loading.",Included

1230,"Gamma radiation tolerance in different life stages of the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster. PURPOSE: Insects are known to have higher levels of radiation tolerance than mammals. The fruit fly Drosophila provides opportunities for genetic analysis of radiation tolerance in insects. A knowledge of stage-specific sensitivity is required to understand the mechanisms and test the existing hypothesis of insect radiation tolerance., MATERIALS AND METHODS: Drosophila melanogaster were irradiated using gamma rays at different life stages. Irradiation doses were chosen to start from 100-2200 Gy with increments of 100 Gy, with a dose rate of 12.5 and 25 Gy/min. The threshold of mortality, LD50 and LD100 1 h post-irradiation was recorded for larvae and adults and 24 h post-irradiation for eggs and after 2-3 days for early and late pupae. Total antioxidant capacity for all the life stages was measured using the phosphomolybdenum method., RESULTS: Twenty-four hours post-irradiation, 100% mortality was recorded for eggs at 1000 Gy. One hour post irradiation 100% mortality was recorded at 1300 Gy for first instar larvae, 1700 Gy for second instar larvae, 1900 Gy for feeding third instar larvae and 2200 Gy for non-feeding third instar larvae. Post-irradiation complete failure of emergence (100% mortality) was observed at 130 Gy for early pupae and 1500 Gy for late pupae; 100% mortality was observed at 1500 Gy for adults. The values of LD50 were recorded as 452 Gy for eggs, 1049 Gy for first instar larvae, 1350 Gy for second instar larvae, 1265 Gy for feeding third instar larvae, 1590 Gy for non-feeding third instar larvae, 50 Gy for early pupae, 969 Gy for late pupae, 1228 Gy for adult males and 1250 Gy for adult females., CONCLUSIONS: Early pupae were found to be prone to radiation, whereas the non-feeding third instar larvae were most resistant among all stages. The chromosome number being constant and total antioxidant capacity being nearly constant in all stages, we suggest that high rate of cell division during early pupae makes this stage sensitive to radiation.",Included
1238,"Radiation- and Age-Associated Changes in Peripheral Blood Dendritic Cell Populations among Aging Atomic Bomb Survivors in Japan. Previous immunological studies in atomic bomb survivors have suggested that radiation exposure leads to long-lasting changes, similar to immunological aging observed in T-cell-adaptive immunity. However, to our knowledge, late effects of radiation on dendritic cells (DCs), the key coordinators for activation and differentiation of T cells, have not yet been investigated in humans. In the current study, we hypothesized that numerical and functional decreases would be observed in relationship to radiation dose in circulating conventional DCs (cDCs) and plasmacytoid DCs (pDCs) among 229 Japanese A-bomb survivors. Overall, the evidence did not support this hypothesis, with no overall changes in DCs or functional changes observed with radiation dose. Multivariable regression analysis for radiation dose, age and gender effects revealed that total DC counts as well as subpopulation counts decreased in relationship to increasing age. Further analyses revealed that in women, absolute numbers of pDCs showed significant decreases with radiation dose. A hierarchical clustering analysis of gene expression profiles in DCs after Toll-like receptor stimulation in vitro identified two clusters of participants that differed in age-associated expression levels of genes involved in antigen presentation and cytokine/chemokine production in cDCs. These results suggest that DC counts decrease and expression levels of gene clusters change with age. More than 60 years after radiation exposure, we also observed changes in pDC counts associated with radiation, but only among women.",Included
1246,"Increased oxidative stress in barn swallows from the Chernobyl region. The Chernobyl nuclear accident produced the largest unintended release of radionuclides in history, with dramatic consequences for humans and other organisms. Exposure to ionizing radiation is known to reduce circulating and stored levels of specific antioxidants in birds and humans, thus potentially increasing oxidative stress. However, overall effects of radioactive exposure on oxidative status have never been investigated in any free ranging vertebrate. We measured plasma antioxidant capacity and concentration of reactive oxygen metabolites in adult barn swallows (Hirundo rustica) from colonies with variable background radiation levels in the Chernobyl region in Ukraine and Belarus. We predicted that antioxidants would decrease while reactive oxygen metabolites would increase with exposure to increasing levels of radiation at the breeding sites. Consistent with this expectation, radiation level positively predicted plasma concentration of reactive oxygen metabolites, whereas no significant covariation was found with non-enzymatic plasma antioxidant capacity. An index of oxidative stress was also larger in barn swallows exposed to high contamination levels. Thus, radioactive contamination appeared to be responsible for the increased generation of reactive oxygen metabolites and the imbalance between reactive oxygen metabolites and non-enzymatic plasma antioxidant capacity. © 2009 Elsevier Inc.

1267,"Decrease of respiratory burst in neutrophils of patients with ankylosing spondylitis by combined radon-hyperthermia treatment. OBJECTIVE: To define the respiratory burst activity of neutrophils, the total anti-oxidative status of plasma, and the parameters of systemic inflammation in patients with ankylosing spondylitis (AS) before and after a combined radon-hyperthermia treatment in the thermal tunnels of Bockstein-Bad Gastein in Austria., METHODS: In 20 patients with AS the effects of a total of 15 hours of radon-hyperthermia-treatment spread over a period of three weeks were studied. The respiratory burst activity of neutrophils was measured fluorometrically using dichlorofluorescein diacetate, the total anti-oxidant status was measured using azinodiethyl-benzthiazoline-sulphonate, and inflammation parameters were determined by routine laboratory assays., RESULTS: Before treatment, the basal neutrophil respiratory burst in patients (n = 20) was 409 +/- 62 fluorescence arbitrary units (AU; mean +/- SEM) and 359 +/- 37 AU in controls (n = 9; p > 0.5); the stimulated respiratory burst (fMet-Leu-Phe, 10(-6) M) was 1,027 +/- 133 AU in patients and 1,152 +/- 218 AU in controls (p > 0.5). After treatment, the basal neutrophil respiratory burst in patients (n = 19) was 137 +/- 16 and in controls it was 174 +/- 35 AU (n = 8; p > 0.1); the stimulated respiratory burst was 670 +/- 66 and 1,305 +/- 82 AU, in patients and controls respectively (p < 0.001). No effects of treatment on the total anti-oxidant status of the plasma or on the parameters of inflammation were detected., CONCLUSION: Combined radon-hyperthermia treatment reduces the respiratory burst activity of the blood circulating neutrophils in patients with AS. If respiratory burst activity from the neutrophils plays a role in the pathophysiology of ankylosing spondylitis, the observed reduction may be related to the beneficial effects of radon-hyperthermia treatment.",Included

OBJECTIVES: The purpose of our study was to assess the risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) mortality in a Canadian cohort of 337 397 individuals (169 256 men and 168 141 women) occupationally exposed to ionizing radiation and included in the National Dose Registry (NDR) of Canada. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Exposure to high doses of ionizing radiation, such as those received during radiotherapy, leads to increased risk of cardiovascular diseases. The emerging evidence of excess risk of CVDs after exposure to doses well below those previously considered as safe warrants epidemiological studies of populations exposed to low levels of ionizing radiation. In the present study, the cohort consisted of employees at nuclear power stations (nuclear workers) as well as medical, dental and industrial workers. The mean whole body radiation dose was 8.6 mSv for men and 1.2 mSv for women. RESULT(S): During the study period (1951-1995), as many as 3 533 deaths from cardiovascular diseases have been identified (3 018 among men and 515 among women). In the cohort, CVD mortality was significantly lower than in the general population of Canada. The cohort showed a significant dose response both among men and women. Risk estimates of CVD mortality in the NDR cohort, when expressed as excess relative risk per unit dose, were higher than those in most other occupational cohorts and higher than in the studies of Japanese atomic bomb survivors. CONCLUSION(S): The study has demonstrated a strong positive association between radiation dose and the risk of CVD mortality. Caution needs to be exercised when interpreting these results, due to the potential bias introduced by dosimetry uncertainties, the possible record linkage errors, and especially by the lack of adjustment for non-radiation risk factors.",Included

Health effects of tritium, a beta-emitter and a by-product of the nuclear industry, is a subject of significant controversy. This mouse in vivo study was undertaken to monitor biological effects of low level tritium exposure. Mice were exposed to tritiated drinking water (HTO) at 10 KBq/L, 1 MBq/L and 20 MBq/L concentrations for one month. The treatment did not result in a significant increase of apoptosis in splenocytes. To examine if this low level tritium exposure alters radiosensitivity, the extracted splenocytes were challenged in vitro with 2 Gy gamma-radiation, and apoptotic responses at 1 and 24 h were measured. No alterations in the radiosensitivity were detected in cells from mice exposed to tritium compared to sham-treated mice. In contrast, low dose gamma-irradiation at 20 or 100 mGy, resulted in a significant increase in resistance to apoptotic cell death after 2 Gy irradiation; an indication of the radioadaptive response. Overall, our data suggest that low concentrations of tritium given to mice as HTO in drinking water do not exert cytotoxic effect in splenocytes, nor do they change cellular sensitivity to additional high dose gamma-radiation. The latter may be considered as the lack of a radioadaptive response, typically observed after low dose gamma-irradiation. © 2013 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.",Included

A 20,000 g pellet obtained from the homogenate of CD1 mouse spleen cells has measurable peroxidase and bactericidal activities. Whole body x-irradiation stimulates the in vitro peroxidative and bactericidal activities of the spleen cells. These cells do not phagocytize. However, addition of polystyrene latex particles to spleen cells from non- or x-irradiated mice, increases glucose oxidation. The extent of this stimulation (three- to fourfold) is less than that of PMN (six- to tenfold). Interaction between particles and lymphocyte surface may be the cause of this stimulation. The increased bactericidal activity due to x-ray is attributed mainly to an increase in the peroxidase activity of the lymphocytes. Surface (membrane) action rather than phagocytosis may be involved in the bactericidal process. The spleen lymphocyte peroxidase is distinct from myeloperoxidase in several respects.",Included

We have previously shown significant pathology in the heart and kidney of murine hematopoietic-acute radiation syndrome (H-ARS) survivors of 8.7-9.0 Gy total-body irradiation (TBI). The goal of this study was to determine temporal relationships in the development of vasculopathy and the progression of renal and cardiovascular delayed effects of acute radiation exposure (DEARE) at TBI doses less than 9 Gy and to elucidate the potential roles of senescence, inflammation and oxidative stress. Our results show significant loss of endothelial cells in coronary arteries by 4 months post-TBI (8.53 or 8.72 Gy of gamma radiation). This loss precedes renal dysfunction and interstitial fibrosis and progresses to abnormalities in the arterial media and adventitia and loss of coronary arterioles. Major differences in radiation-induced pathobiology exist between the heart and kidney in terms of vasculopathy progression and also in indices of inflammation, senescence and oxidative imbalance. The results of this work suggest a need for different medical countermeasures for multiple targets in different organs and at various times after acute radiation injury to prevent the progression of DEARE.",Included

PURPOSE: In vitro, ionizing radiation of epithelial cells leads to upregulation of wild-type p53 and subsequent induction of p21(waf1). The effect of radiotherapy (RT) on the expression of these proteins in patients is unknown. We assessed the influence of RT on the expression of p53 and p21(waf1) in normal mucosa and rectal carcinomas in vivo., METHODS: Tumor and normal tissue samples were derived from rectal cancer patients randomized in a clinical trial in which the value of preoperative RT was evaluated. p53 and p21(waf1) expression was determined in 51 irradiated and 52 nonirradiated patients using immunohistochemistry., RESULTS: In normal mucosa, both p53 and p21(waf1) were strongly upregulated after RT compared with the expression in unirradiated normal tissue (p <0.001). In tumor cells, no significant difference in the expression of p53 or p21(waf1) was found in the irradiated vs. nonirradiated group. In the few rectal tumors with wild-type p53, induction of p53 after RT did not necessarily lead to upregulation of p21(waf1)., CONCLUSION: These findings demonstrate that in normal mucosa, a functional p53-p21(waf1) pathway is present, whereas in tumor cells it is defective in almost all cases because of either p53 mutation or down- or upstream disruption in tumors with wild-type p53. Therefore, we believe that the role of p53 expression as a single prognostic marker in rectal cancer needs reconsideration.",Included

1464,"Differential recovery of neural stem cells in the subventricular zone and dentate gyrus after ionizing radiation. Radiation therapy is a widely used treatment for malignant central nervous system tumors. Mature neurons are terminally differentiated, whereas stem and progenitor cells have a prominent proliferative capacity and are therefore highly vulnerable to irradiation. Our aim was to investigate how cranial radiation in young rats would affect stem/progenitor cells in the two niches of adult neurogenesis, the subventricular zone (SVZ) and the dentate gyrus of the hippocampal formation. Nine weeks after irradiation we found that in irradiated animals, hippocampal neurogenesis was reduced to 5% of control levels. Similarly, the numbers of actively proliferating cells and radial glia-like stem cells (nestin+/glial fibrillary acidic protein [GFAP]+) in the dentate gyrus were reduced to 10% and 15% of control levels, respectively. In the irradiated olfactory bulb, neurogenesis was reduced to 40% of control levels, and the number of actively proliferating cells in the SVZ was reduced to 53% of control levels. However, the number of nestin+/GFAP+ cells in the SVZ was unchanged compared with controls. To evaluate the immediate response to the radiation injury, we quantified the amount of proliferation in the SVZ and dentate gyrus 1 day after irradiation. We found an equal reduction in proliferating cells both in dentate gyrus and SVZ. In summary, we show an initial response to radiation injury that is similar in both brain stem cell niches. However, the long-term effects on stem cells and neurogenesis in these two areas differ significantly: the dentate gyrus is severely affected long-term, whereas the SVZ appears to recover with time.",Included
1477,"Long-term outcomes after radiosurgery for acoustic neuromas. BACKGROUND: Stereotactic radiosurgery is the principal alternative to microsurgical resection for acoustic neuromas (vestibular schwannomas). The goals of radiosurgery are the long-term prevention of tumor growth, maintenance of neurologic function, and prevention of new neurologic deficits. Although acceptable short-term outcomes have been reported, long-term outcomes have not been well documented., METHODS: We evaluated 162 consecutive patients who underwent radiosurgery for acoustic neuromas between 1987 and 1992 by means of serial imaging tests, clinical evaluations, and a survey between 5 and 10 years after the procedure. The average dose of radiation to the tumor margin was 16 Gy, and the mean transverse diameter of the tumor was 22 mm (range, 8 to 39). Resection had been performed previously in 42 patients (26 percent); in 13 patients the tumor represented a recurrence of disease after a previous total resection. Facial function was normal in 76 percent of the patients before radiosurgery, and 20 percent had useful hearing., RESULTS: The rate of tumor control (with no resection required) was 98 percent. One hundred tumors (62 percent) became smaller, 53 (33 percent) remained unchanged in size, and 9 (6 percent) became slightly larger. Resection was performed in four patients (2 percent) within four years after radiosurgery. Normal facial function was preserved in 79 percent of the patients after five years (House-Brackmann grade 1), and normal trigeminal function was preserved in 73 percent. Fifty-one percent of the patients had no change in hearing ability. No new neurologic deficits appeared more than 28 months after radiosurgery. An outcomes questionnaire was returned by 115 patients (77 percent of the 149 patients still living). Fifty-four of these patients (47 percent) were employed at the time of radiosurgery, and 37 (69 percent) remained so. Radiosurgery was believed to have been successful by all 30 patients who had undergone surgery previously and by 81 (95 percent) of the 85 who had not. Thirty-six of the 115 patients (31 percent) described at least one complication, which resolved in 56 percent of those cases., CONCLUSIONS: Radiosurgery can provide long-term control of acoustic neuromas while preserving neurologic function.",Included

1507,"Should adjuvant radiotherapy be recommended following resection of regional lymph node metastases of malignant melanomas?. Background: Several authors have recommended adjuvant radiotherapy following resection of regional lymph node metastases in cutaneous malignant melanoma. There is, however, little evidence from controlled trials that patients benefit from this treatment. Objective(s): To evaluate the usefulness of adjuvant, radiotherapy following resection of lymph node metastases in cutaneous malignant melanoma. Method(s): We performed a retrospective study comparing 58 patients who underwent radiotherapy following resection of regional lymph node metastases with 58 controls from another centre who exclusively underwent regional lymphadenectomy. Patients and their controls were matched with respect to the number of tumour-bearing lymph nodes (1 vs. 1) and to gender, although the proportion of thick tumours was greater in the irradiation group. Result(s): The overall survival curves were almost identical in the two groups. There were nine disease recurrences in the study group and 12 in the control group (not significant). Regional recurrences in the irradiated patients were usually accompanied by metastases at other sites. Conclusion(s): The present study does not support the recommendation of adjuvant radiotherapy following resection of regional lymph node metastases in patients with malignant melanoma.",Included
1523,"Stage I-II non-small-cell lung cancer treated using either stereotactic ablative radiotherapy (SABR) or lobectomy by video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS): outcomes of a propensity score-matched analysis. BACKGROUND: Video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) lobectomy and stereotactic ablative radiotherapy (SABR) are both used for early-stage non-small-cell lung cancer. We carried out a propensity score-matched analysis to compare locoregional control (LRC).
PATIENTS AND METHODS: VATS lobectomy data from six hospitals were retrospectively accessed; SABR data were obtained from a single institution database. Patients were matched using propensity scores based on cTNM stage, age, gender, Charlson comorbidity score, lung function and performance score. Eighty-six VATS and 527 SABR patients were matched blinded to outcome (1:1 ratio, caliper distance 0.025). Locoregional failure was defined as recurrence in/adjacent to the planning target volume/surgical margins, ipsilateral hilum or mediastinum. Recurrences were either biopsy-confirmed or had to be PET-positive and reviewed by a tumor board.
RESULTS: The matched cohort consisted of 64 SABR and 64 VATS patients with the median follow-up of 30 and 16 months, respectively. Post-SABR LRC rates were superior at 1 and 3 years (96.8% and 93.3% versus 86.9% and 82.6%, respectively, P = 0.04). Distant recurrences and overall survival (OS) were not significantly different.
CONCLUSION: This retrospective analysis found a superior LRC after SABR compared with VATS lobectomy, but OS did not differ. Our findings support the need to compare both treatments in a randomized, controlled trial.",Included
1530,"Gender difference in the development of ischemic heart disease in emergency workers of the Chernobyl accident. Objectives: Since women accounted for only 8.7% of the total number of Chernobyl emergency workers (EW), the radiation effect on cardiovascular system was previously studied mainly in men. So the goal of current investigation was to determine the development of ischemic heart disease (IHD) in men and women exposed to ionizing radiation. Method(s): The study included 598 EW of 1986 year (472 men and 126 women) who had no signs of cardiac pathology during they took part in elimination of consequences caused by the Chernobyl accident. For that time women's age was 41+/-6.9 years, but men 37.8+/-8.5 years (p=0.011). The female group was also significantly older than the male at the time of the examination (69.1+/-7.2 versus 63.7+/-10.4, p=0). Patients of both groups in 2012-2016 after admission in our hospital had cardiologist examination, electrocardiography, daily monitoring of electrocardiogram, echocardiography. Result(s): At the time of examination IHD in women was more often combined with arterial hypertension (94.4% compared to 87.7% in men, p=0.001), diabetes mellitus (27.0% vs. 23.9% in men, p=0.828), alimentary obesity (57.1% vs. 39.2%, p=0) and hypercholesterolemia (66.7% versus 60.4%, p=0.239). In both groups, the portion of patients with stroke was practically equal (9.5% and 9.7%) as well as with blockade (2.4% and 2.3%), atrial fibrillation (16.7% and 16.5%), and ventricular extrasystoles (7.9% and 7%). Men were more likely to have supraventricular arrhythmias (13.3% and 1.6%, p=0.042) and higher number of smokers (40.9% and 1.6%, p=0). It was shown that 25% of all male EW developed IHD in 11.7+/-0.5 years after irradiation, while the same number of EW-women after 15.5+/-1.3 years. Exactly half of male group had the diagnosis of IHD after 18.7+/-0.8 years while women after 21.6+/-0.7 years. After 24.7+/-0.4 and 26.8+/-0.5 years, IHD developed in 75% of men and women, respectively. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis showed high reliability of differences in the development of IHD in two examined groups (logrank test: chi<sup>2</sup> = 10.001, p=0,001). The median survival rate fell on the age of 57+/-0.6 years for men and 61.4+/-0.9 years of women. Conclusion(s): The gender specific features of IHD development in EW consisted in its earlier term of onset after irradiation in men than in women. Men developed IHD at younger age than women despite the presence of a greater number of people with risk factors such as hypertension, diabetes mellitus, hypercholesterolemia and obesity.",Included

The risk of radiation-induced nodules is higher than the risk for radiation-induced cancer. Risk factors and specific modifiers of the dose-response relationship may vary among different populations and not be well recognized. Many thyroid studies have considered thyroid nodularity itself, but not specific morphological types of thyroid nodules. There are many specific types of thyroid nodules which follow a morphological classification of thyroid lesions, including some congenital and tumor-like conditions. Modern equipment and technique can help us to identify particular specific types of thyroid nodules. In this study we report some results of a clinically applicable approach to materials derived from three studies. From 1999 through 2002, we have screened 571 current residents from 4 exposed and 1 control village near the Semipalatinsk Nuclear Test Site area, who were of similar ages (<20) at the time of major radiation fallout events at the SNTS. Prevalent nodules were identified by ultrasound and fine-needle aspiration biopsy, cytopathology results. Analysis of ultrasound images and cytopathology of thyroid lesions among exposed and non-exposed population allowed us to distinguish some interesting ultrasound features for specific types of thyroid nodules. We believe that it would be interesting and possibly more informative for thyroid dosimetry studies to consider specific morphological types of thyroid nodules. We need more detailed research to clarify the feasibility of applying these findings for study of the dose-response relationship.",Included

1561,"Do radiation-induced bystander effects correlate to the intrinsic radiosensitivity of individuals and have clinical significance?. It is well known that patients can vary in their normal tissue response to radiotherapy, and this can be problematic. As a result, radiobiologists have been using in vitro models to assess variation in response and elucidate the genetic determinants of this variation. However, the clinical relevance of these models is currently unknown. In this study, blood samples from healthy controls (n 20) and colorectal carcinoma patients (n 60) were cultured in vitro to assess two radiobiological end points in parallel: intrinsic radiosensitivity assayed by chromosomal aberrations (G2 scores) and radiation-induced bystander effects assayed by viability testing. Increased intrinsic radiosensitivity was observed in colorectal carcinoma donors (55) compared to the healthy donors (5) (P < 0.005). Similarly, more pronounced radiation-induced bystander effects were observed in the colorectal carcinoma donors compared to the healthy donors after 24 h exposure but not after 96 h exposure to donor irradiated cell conditioned medium (ICCM) (P < 0.05). All scores were tested for correlation with the age, sex and clinical stage of the colorectal carcinoma patients. The only statistically significant correlation was found in samples from severe Dukes D patients (P < 0.005), which had low/radioresistant G2 scores. No correlation was found between radiation-induced intrinsic sensitivity and bystander effects, which suggests that they may have separate underlying molecular mechanisms, but they both show clinical relevance in individual patient samples. © 2009 The Radiation Research Society.",Included

1585,"The Impact of Dose Rate on DNA Double-Strand Break Formation and Repair in Human Lymphocytes Exposed to Fast Neutron Irradiation. The lack of information on how biological systems respond to low-dose and low dose-rate exposures makes it difficult to accurately assess the carcinogenic risks. This is of critical importance to space radiation, which remains a serious concern for long-term manned space exploration. In this study, the gamma-H2AX foci assay was used to follow DNA double-strand break (DSB) induction and repair following exposure to neutron irradiation, which is produced as secondary radiation in the space environment. Human lymphocytes were exposed to high dose-rate (HDR: 0.400 Gy/min) and low dose-rate (LDR: 0.015 Gy/min) p(66)/Be(40) neutrons. DNA DSB induction was investigated 30 min post exposure to neutron doses ranging from 0.125 to 2 Gy. Repair kinetics was studied at different time points after a 1 Gy neutron dose. Our results indicated that gamma-H2AX foci formation was 40% higher at HDR exposure compared to LDR exposure. The maximum gamma-H2AX foci levels decreased gradually to 1.65 +/- 0.64 foci/cell (LDR) and 1.29 +/- 0.45 (HDR) at 24 h postirradiation, remaining significantly higher than background levels. This illustrates a significant effect of dose rate on neutron-induced DNA damage. While no significant difference was observed in residual DNA damage after 24 h, the DSB repair half-life of LDR exposure was slower than that of HDR exposure. The results give a first indication that the dose rate should be taken into account for cancer risk estimations related to neutrons.",Included

Incidence and mortality from cerebrovascular diseases (CVD) (430-438 ICD-9 codes) have been studied in a cohort of 18,763 workers first employed at the Mayak Production Association (Mayak PA) in 1948-1972 and followed up to the end of 2005. Some of the workers were exposed to external gamma-rays only while others were exposed to a mixture of external gamma-rays and internal alpha-particle radiation due to incorporated (239)Pu. After adjusting for non-radiation factors, there were significantly increasing trends in CVD incidence with total absorbed dose from external gamma-rays and total absorbed dose to liver from internal alpha radiation. The CVD incidence was statistically significantly higher among workers with total absorbed external gamma-ray doses greater than 0.20 Gy compared to those exposed to lower doses; the data were consistent with a linear trend in risk with external dose. The CVD incidence was statistically significantly higher among workers with total absorbed internal alpha-radiation doses to liver from incorporated (239)Pu greater than 0.025 Gy compared to those exposed to lower doses. There was no statistically significant trend in CVD mortality risk with either external gamma-ray dose or internal alpha-radiation dose to liver. The risk estimates obtained are generally compatible with those from other large occupational studies, although the incidence data point to higher risk estimates compared to those from the Japanese A-bomb survivors. Further studies of the unique cohort of Mayak workers chronically exposed to external and internal radiation will allow improving the reliability and validating the radiation safety standards for occupational and public exposure.",Included
1606,"Late Effects of Head and Neck Radiotherapy on Pulp Vitality Assessed by Pulse Oximetry. INTRODUCTION: Radiation therapy (RT) of malignant tumors in the head and neck area may have damaging effects on surrounding tissues. The aim of this investigation was to evaluate the long-term effects of ionizing radiation on pulp vitality by measuring pulp oxygenation levels (%SpO2) in patients with history of RT of intraoral and oropharyngeal tumors 4-6 years after treatment., METHODS: In an experimental group RT (n = 90, history of RT) and a control group CON (n = 90, no history of RT), pulp vitality was assessed by measuring %SpO2 by using pulse oximetry and pulp sensitivity by cold thermal testing. All anterior teeth without history of endodontic therapy of the participants in group RT were measured (n = 693), regardless of the quadrant and the irradiated area. An equal number of anterior teeth were tested in group CON., RESULTS: There was no significant difference between the %SpO2 levels in group RT (92.7%; standard deviation, +/- 1.83) and group CON (92.6%; standard deviation, +/- 1.80). All teeth in RT and CON groups showed a positive response to the thermal test. All tested teeth were considered vital., CONCLUSIONS: Pulp %SpO2 was found to be within normal limits 4-6 years after RT. This suggests that RT may not have a long-term influence on pulp vitality, and reported short-term changes in pulpal microcirculation because of RT may be temporary.

BACKGROUND: Nuclear workers may be exposed to a variety of chemical hazards, in addition to radiation. We examined the effect of chemical exposures on cancer mortality among French uranium processing workers at the AREVA NC Pierrelatte facility., METHODS: A cohort of 2,897 uranium processing workers employed for at least 6 months was followed from 1968 through 2006. Exposure to uranium and potentially carcinogenic chemicals was assessed with a plant-specific job-exposure matrix. Mortality hazard ratios (HRs) for cancers of the lung, lymphohematopoietic system, kidney and bladder, brain and central nervous system (BCNS), and prostate were estimated for each specific chemical exposure, with Cox regression models stratified for sex and calendar period and adjusted for socioeconomic status. Additional adjustments enabled us to examine the effect of co-exposure to uranium and other chemicals., RESULTS: Exposure to aromatic solvents was associated with increased risk of BCNS malignancies after adjustment for other chemicals (HR=6.53, 95% CI=1.14-37.41; n=6) and for other chemicals and uranium (HR=7.26, 95% CI=0.90-58.19) in the annual exposure status model. Selected groups of lymphohematopoietic cancers were found associated with solvent exposure. Inconclusive results were found regarding chromium (VI) exposure, since only 2 workers died from lung cancer among 109 exposed., CONCLUSION: Based on our pilot study, it seemed important to take into account chemical exposures in the analyses of cancer mortality among French uranium processing workers.

Objective: To estimate the incidence of malignant neoplasms of lymphoid tissue (MNLT) among employees of the Siberian Chemical Combine (SC) occupationally exposed to prolonged ionizing radiation. Material and Methods. The study included 44,041 employees of the SC, of whom 16,938 were occupationally exposed to prolonged low-intensity ionizing radiation (IR). Of 295 cases with hemoblastoses, there were 89 with occupational exposure to IR. The structure and incidence of hemoblastoses (based on the number of person-years of observation, (PYO), as well as the standardized relative risk (SRR) of their development and excess relative risk (ERR) per unit dose of radiation (Gr) were evaluated. Calculation of SRR was carried out for the following intervals of the total dose of external exposure: 0; >0-0.05; >0.05-0.10; >0.10-0.15; >0.15-0.20; >0.20-0.30; >0.30-0.50; >0.5-1.0; >= 1.0 G y. The control group consisted of occupationally non-exposed employees of the SC. The calculation of SRR and ERR was performed using the Poisson regression using the AM FIT module of the EPICU RE package. Results. The incidence of MNLT among males of SC was 17.1 per 100,000 P YO, with the highest incidence rates for Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL), chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CL) and chronic leukemia (CL) excluding CL. Among females of the SC, the incidence of MNLT was 21.3 per 100,000 PYO. It was found that in none of the intervals of the external exposure there was no statistically significant excess of the SRR compared with the control group. The results of ERR/Gy calculation also did not demonstrate the increased risk of hemoblastosis among people occupationally exposed to IR. Conclusion. Occupational exposure in the studied dose range does not increase the risk of developing MNLT.Copyright © 2020, Tomsk National Research Medical Center of the Russian Academy of Sciences.

Analysis of the loss of heterozygosity at the D5Mit143 locus was done for thymic lymphlomas induced by gamma-irradiation of mice from two reciprocal backcrosses (BALB/c x CcS-13)F1 x BALB/c and (BALB/c x CcS-13)F1 x CcS-13. BALB/c mice are susceptible to gamma-ray induction of lymphomas. The CcS-13 strain is one of 20 CcS/Dcm (CcS) series of recombinant congenic strains, and the CcS-13 mice are resistant to gamma-radiation-induced lymphomas [1, 8].

Systemic and local radiation injuries caused by nuclear power reactor accidents, therapeutic irradiation, or nuclear terrorism should be prevented or properly treated in order to improve wound management and save lives. Currently, regenerative surgical modalities should be attempted with temporal artificial dermis impregnated and sprayed with a local angiogenic factor such as basic fibroblast growth factor, and secondary reconstruction can be a candidate for demarcation and saving the donor morbidity. Human mesenchymal stem cells and adipose-derived stem cells, together with angiogenic and mitogenic factor of basic fibroblast growth factor and an artificial dermis, were applied over the excised irradiated skin defect and were tested for differentiation and local stimulation effects in the radiation-exposed wounds. The perforator flap and artificial dermal template with growth factor were successful for reconstruction in patients who were suffering from complex underlying disease. Patients were uneventfully treated with minimal morbidities. In the experiments, the hMSCs are strongly proliferative even after 20 Gy irradiation in vitro. In vivo, 4 Gy rat whole body irradiation demonstrated that sustained marrow stromal (mesenchymal stem) cells survived in the bone marrow. Immediate artificial dermis application impregnated with cells and the cytokine over the 20 Gy irradiated skin and soft tissues demonstrated the significantly improved fat angiogenesis, architected dermal reconstitution, and less inflammatory epidermal recovery. Detailed understanding of underlying diseases and rational reconstructive procedures brings about good outcomes for difficult irradiated wound healing.

1699,"Identification of ERp29 as a biomarker for predicting nasopharyngeal carcinoma response to radiotherapy. Radioresistance continues to be a major problem in the treatment of nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC). This study aimed to identify novel proteins associated with NPC radio-resistance. We used a mass spectrometry driven-proteomic strategy to identify novel proteins associated with NPC radio-resistance, and differential proteins were subsequently processed by bio-informatic analysis. As a result, twelve proteins were identified with aberrant expression in radioresistant (RR) NPC tissues compare to radiosensitive (RS) NPC tissues. Among these proteins, ERp29, Mn-SOD, HSP27 and GST omega1 were found to be significantly up-regulated in RR NPC tissues, and ERp29 was selected for further validation. Immunohistochemistry analysis confirmed that ERp29 was overexpressed in RR NPC tissues compared with RS NPC tissues. To prove the role of ERp29 in the induction of NPC radioresistance, ERp29 was down-regulated in the ERp29 enriched NPC cells CNE-1 and 6-10B by specific shRNA. Radiosensitivity was measured using cell proliferation assay and clonogenic survival assay, and cell apoptosis was measured using flow cytometric analysis. We found that ERp29 knockdown attenuated CNE-1 and 6-10B cell radioresistance and enhanced cell apoptosis. These results suggest that ERp29 associates with radioresistance in NPC, and ERp29 could be a potential biomarker for predicting NPC response to radiotherapy.",Included

In this analysis we used a proportional hazards model to assess effects of radiotherapy on risks of subsequent inflammatory disease morbidity in 110,368 US radiologic technologists followed from a baseline survey (1983-1989/1994-1998) through 2008. We used a linear model to assess log-transformed C-reactive protein concentration following radiotherapy in 1326 technologists. Relative risk of diabetes increased following radiotherapy (p < 0.001), and there was a borderline significant increasing trend per treatment (p = 0.092). For osteoarthritis there was increased relative risk associated with prior radiotherapy on all questionnaires (p = 0.005), and a significant increasing trend per previous treatment (p = 0.024). No consistent increases were observed for other types of inflammatory disease (hypothyroidism, hyperthyroidism, rheumatoid arthritis) associated with radiotherapy. There was a borderline significant (p = 0.059) increasing trend with dose for C-reactive protein with numbers of prior radiotherapy treatments. Our results suggest that radiotherapy is associated with subsequent increased risk of certain inflammatory conditions, which is reinforced by our finding of elevated levels of C-reactive protein.",Included

1778,"Cell Salvage During Liver Transplantation for Hepatocellular Carcinoma: A Retrospective Analysis of Tumor Recurrence Following Irradiation of the Salvaged Blood. BACKGROUND: Orthotopic liver transplantation (OLT) is the treatment option for early-stage hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). OLT is often associated with high blood loss, requiring blood transfusion. Retransfusion of autologous blood is a key part of blood conservation. There are, however, concerns that the retransfusion of salvaged blood might cause the spread of cancer cells and induce metastasis. Irradiation of salvaged blood before retransfusion eliminates viable cancer cells. Here, we analyzed the incidence of tumor recurrence in patients with HCC undergoing OLT who received irradiated cell-salvaged blood during transplant surgery., METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed patients undergoing OLT for HCC between 2002 and 2018 at our center. We compared the tumour recurrence in patients who received no retransfusion of autologous blood with patients who received autologous blood with or without preceding irradiation of the blood., RESULTS: Fifty-one (40 male, 11 female) patients were included in the analysis; 10 patients developed tumor recurrence within a time period of 2.45 +/- 2.0 years. Statistical analysis revealed that there was no significant difference in tumor recurrence between patients who received autologous blood with or without irradiation., CONCLUSION: Intraoperative transfusion of cell-salvaged blood did not increase tumor recurrence rates. Cell salvage should be used in liver transplantation of HCC patients as part of a blood conservation strategy. The effect of blood irradiation on tumor recurrence could not be definitively evaluated.

A total of 255 PTC cases (123 Chernobyl radiation-induced and 132 sporadic, all in Caucasians) and 596 healthy controls (198 residents of Chernobyl areas and 398 subjects without history of radiation exposure, all Caucasians) were genotyped. The risk of PTC and SNPs interactions with radiation exposure were assessed by logistic regressions. The ATM G5557A and XRCC1 Arg399Gln polymorphisms, regardless of radiation exposure, associated with a decreased risk of PTC according to the multiplicative and dominant models of inheritance (odds ratio (OR) = 0.69, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.45-0.86 and OR = 0.70, 95% CI 0.59-0.93 respectively).

Comparison of mean values of hematological parameters based on the student's t-tests between irradiated blood alone, iodinated radiographic contrast media-incubated blood alone, and combination-exposed blood to each corresponding control blood was performed. Result(s): These data showed no change in the hematological parameters and morphology of red blood cells in irradiated blood alone, iodinated radiographic contrast media-incubated blood alone, and combination-exposed blood in both male and female subjects when compared to control blood at all fluoroscopic X-ray times. Conclusion(s): These finding suggested that there were no harmful effects following fluoroscopic X-rays combined with iodinated radiographic contrast media when human blood was irradiated in an in vitro condition.Copyright © 2021, Korean Society of Environmental Risk Assessment and Health Science.",Included

1886,"Gamma-radiation sensitivity and risk of glioma. BACKGROUND: About 9% of human cancers are brain tumors, of which 90% are gliomas. gamma-Radiation has been identified as a risk factor for brain tumors. In a previous pilot study, we found that lymphocytes from patients with glioma were more sensitive to gamma-radiation than were lymphocytes from matched control subjects. In this larger case-control study, we compared the gamma-radiation sensitivity of lymphocytes from glioma patients with those from control subjects and investigated the association between mutagen sensitivity and the risk for developing glioma., METHODS: We used a mutagen sensitivity assay (an indirect measure of DNA repair activity) to assess chromosomal damage. We gamma-irradiated (1.5 Gy) short-term lymphocyte cultures from 219 case patients with glioma and from 238 healthy control subjects frequency matched by age and sex. After irradiation, cells were cultured for 4 hours, and then Colcemid was added for 1 hour to arrest cells in mitosis. Fifty metaphases were randomly selected for each sample and scored for chromatid breaks. All statistical tests were two-sided., RESULTS: We observed a statistically significantly higher frequency of chromatid breaks per cell from case patients with glioma (mean = 0.55; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.50 to 0.59) than from control subjects (mean = 0.44; 95% CI = 0.41 to 0.48) (P<.001). Using 0.40 (the median number of chromatid breaks per cell in control subjects) as the cut point for defining mutagen sensitivity and adjusting for age, sex, and smoking status, we found that mutagen sensitivity was statistically significantly associated with an increased risk for glioma (odds ratio = 2.09; 95% CI = 1.43 to 3.06). When the data were divided into tertiles, the relative risk for glioma increased from the lowest tertile to the highest tertile (trend test, P<.001)., CONCLUSION: gamma-Radiation-induced mutagen sensitivity of lymphocytes may be associated with an increased risk for glioma, a result that supports our earlier preliminary findings.",Included

1914,"Multifaceted applications of pre-mature chromosome condensation in radiation biodosimetry. Background: Biodosimetry with persistent cytogenetic indicators in peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBLs) plays crucial role in regulatory/medical management of individuals overexposed to radiation. Conventional methods require ~48 h culture and have limited dose range (0.1-5Gy) applications due to checkpoint arrest/poor stimulation. G0-Phase Premature chromosome condensation (G0-PCC) allows chromosome aberration analysis within hours after blood collection. Due to high skill demand, applications of G0-PCC were not very well explored and being re-visited worldwide. Among all aberrations, analysis of excess chromosomal fragments is quickest. Radiation dose response curve for the fragments has been reported. Purpose(s): In present study, excess fragment analysis has been addressed in detail, in addition to validation of radiation dose response curve, gender variation in the response, dose dependent repair kinetics, minimum detection limit (MDL), duration and accuracy of final dose estimation with 5blindfolded, ex vivo irradiated samples have been studied. In extension, feasibility of multiparametric dosimetry with Fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) based endpoints were qualitatively explored. Material(s) and Method(s): PBLs were exposed to Gamma-Radiation and G0-PCC was performed at different time points. Decay kinetics and dose response curve were established. Gender Variation of the frequency of the fragments was assessed at 0, 2 and 4 Gy. FISH was performed with G0-PCC applying centromere probe, whole chromosome paints, multi-color FISH and multi-color banding probes. Result(s): Radiation response curve for fragments was found to be linear (Slope 1.09 +/- 0.031 Gy-1). Background frequency as well as dose response did not show significant gender bias. Based on variation in background frequency of fragments MDL was calculated to be ~0.3 Gy. Kinetics of fragment tested at 0, 4, 8, 16 and 24 h showed exponential decay pattern from 0 to 8 h and without further decay. Final dose estimation of five samples was completed within 13 man-hours. Dicentric chromosomes, translocations, insertions and breaks were identifiable in combination with centromere FISH and WCP. Advanced methods employing multicolor FISH and multi-color banding were also demonstrated with PCC spreads. Conclusion(s): G0-PCC, can be useful tool for high dose biodosimetry with quick assessment of fragment frequency. Further, it holds potential for multi-parametric dosimetry in combination with FISH.© Copyright © 2020 Taylor & Francis Group LLC.",Included
1916,"Noncancer disease incidence in the atomic bomb survivors: 1958-1986. Using the longitudinal data of the Adult Health Study (AHS) cohort collected during 1958-1986, we examined for the first time the relationship between exposure to ionizing radiation and the incidence of 19 nonmalignant disorders in the A-bomb survivors. Affected individuals were ascertained through the three-digit codes of the International Classification of Diseases which are encoded in the AHS database subsequent to diagnoses made on the basis of general laboratory tests, physical examinations, and history-taking conducted during biennial AHS examinations. The disease onset time was estimated using the mid-point between the AHS examination data when the disease was initially reported and the previously attended disease-free examination date. Dosimetry System 86 organ doses judged to be most appropriate were used. Tests of dose effects were performed assuming a linear relative risk model with stratified background incidence. For the entire study period, significant excess risk was detected for uterine myoma (P < 0.001), chronic liver disease and cirrhosis (P = 0.006), and thyroid disease (P < 0.0001), defined broadly as the presence of one or more of certain noncancerous thyroid conditions. The incidence of myocardial infarction was shown to be increased (P = 0.03) in later years (1968-1986) among the younger heavily exposed AHS subjects, confirming the results of the recent Life Span Study (LSS) noncancer mortality report on coronary heart disease. The findings for uterine myoma may serve as additional evidence indicating benign tumor growth as a possible consequence of radiation exposure. Our results indicating the involvement of radiation in the development of liver diseases are consistent with the report of increased mortality from liver cirrhosis with radiation dose in the LSS cohort. An effect of age at exposure was detected for nonmalignant thyroid disease (P = 0.02), with an increased risk for those exposed who were under 20 years of age, but not for older survivors. Thus the AHS data suggest that thyroid glands in the young are more radiosensitive not only to the development of malignancies, but also to the development of nonmalignant disorders as well. The findings hold independently of the dose effects observed for thyroid cancer. This study also shows that for the period 1958-1986 new occurrences of lens opacity are not increased with radiation dose (P = 0.39) in the AHS subjects.",Included
1945,"Translocation Frequency in Patients with Repeated CT Exposure: Comparison with CT-Naive Patients. Epidemiologic studies using clinical indicators are limited in the assessment of the biological effects of low-dose ionizing radiation for medical purposes. We evaluated the biological effect of low-dose radiation by comparing translocation frequencies in patients with repeated computed tomography (CT) exposure and CT-naive patients. The goal of this prospective case-control study was to determine whether repeated CT exposure is associated with increased frequency in chromosomal translocations. Two cohorts, comprised of case patients with a history of repeated CT exposure and age- and sex-matched CT-naive control patients (n = 48 per cohort), were consecutively enrolled in this single-institution study. CT-radiation exposure was estimated using dose-length products, and translocation frequencies of peripheral blood lymphocytes were assessed using whole chromosome paints by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH). Comparison of translocation frequencies between cases and controls was performed using the Wilcoxon rank sum test (paired samples), and the relationship between cumulative radiation exposure and translocation frequency was assessed using a partial correlation analysis. Translocation frequencies were significantly different between cases and controls (P = 0.0003). The median translocation frequency was 7 [95% confidence interval (CI): 6, 8] for cases and 4 (95% CI: 3, 6) for controls. By using cumulative radiation exposure as the effect variable and translocation frequency as the response variable, we found a significant correlation between cumulative radiation exposure and translocation frequency (r = 0.6579, P < 0.0001). Chromosomal translocations were more frequent with repeated CT-exposed patients than in CT-naive patients, and a positive dose-response relationship was present between cumulative radiation exposure and translocation frequency.",Included
1954,"Occupational health hazards of working in the interventional laboratory: a multisite case control study of physicians and allied staff. BACKGROUND: The occupational hazards of working in the interventional laboratory have been inadequately studied for physicians and remain unaddressed for nonphysician personnel., OBJECTIVES: This study sought to determine whether the prevalence of work-related musculoskeletal pain, cancer, and other medical conditions is higher among physicians and allied staff who work in interventional laboratories compared with employees who do not., METHODS: Mayo Clinic employees who work in affiliated hospitals with interventional cardiology or interventional radiology laboratories took an electronic survey. Results were stratified on the basis of self-reported occupational exposure to procedures that involve radiation., RESULTS: There were 1,543 employees (mean age 43 +/- 11.3 years, 33% male) who responded to the survey (response rate of 57%), and 1,042 (67.5%) reported being involved with procedures utilizing radiation. These employees reported experiencing work-related pain more often than the control group before (54.7% vs. 44.7%; p < 0.001) and after adjustment for age, sex, body mass index, pre-existing musculoskeletal conditions, years in profession, and job description (odds ratio: 1.67; 95% confidence interval: 1.32 to 2.11; p < 0.001). Musculoskeletal pain varied significantly by job description, with the highest incidence reported by technicians (62%) and nurses (60%) followed by attending physicians (44%) and trainees (19%; p < 0.001). There was no difference in cancer prevalence between groups (9% vs. 9%; p = 0.96)., CONCLUSIONS: Musculoskeletal pain is more common among healthcare workers who participate in interventional procedures and is highest in nonphysician employees. The diagnosis of cancer in employees who participate in procedures that utilize radiation was not elevated when compared to controls within the same departments, although any conclusion regarding causality is limited by the cross-sectional nature of the study, as well as the low overall prevalence of malignancy in our study group.

The effect of the G2 repair of chromosomal damage in lymphocytes from workers exposed to low levels of X- or gamma-rays was evaluated. Samples of peripheral blood were collected from 15 radiation workers, 20 subjects working in radiodiagnostics, and 30 healthy control donors. Chromosomal aberrations (CA) were evaluated by scoring the presence of chromatid and isochromatid breaks, dicentric and ring chromosomes in lymphocytes with/without 5 mM caffeine plus 3 mM-aminobenzamide (3-AB) treatment during G2. Our results showed that the mean value of basal aberrations in lymphocytes from exposed workers was higher than in control cells (p < 0.001). The chromosomal damage in G2, detected with caffeine plus 3-AB treatment was higher than the basal damage (untreated conditions), both in control and exposed populations (p < 0.05). In the exposed workers group, the mean value of chromosomal abnormalities in G2 was higher than in the control (p < 0.0001). No correlation was found between the frequency of chromosome type of aberrations (basal or in G2), and the absorbed dose. Nevertheless, significant correlation coefficients (p < 0.05) between absorbed dose and basal aberrations yield (r = 0.430) or in G2 (r = 0.448) were detected when chromatid breaks were included in the total aberrations yield. Under this latter condition no significant effect of age, years of employment or smoking habit on the chromosomal aberrations yield was detected. However, analysis of the relationship between basal aberrations yield and the efficiency of G2 repair mechanisms, defined as the percentage of chromosomal lesions repaired in G2, showed a significant correlation coefficient (r = -0.802; p < 0.001). These results suggest that in addition to the absorbed dose, the individual G2 repair efficiency may be another important factor affecting the chromosomal aberrations yield detected in workers exposed to low-level ionizing radiation.",Included
1967,"The biomechanical effects of 1.0 to 1.2 Mrad of gamma irradiation on human bone-patellar tendon-bone allografts. Recent data suggest that anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction with irradiated allograft tissue may lead to increased failure rates. Low-dose (1.0-1.2 Mrad) gamma irradiation does not significantly alter the preimplantation biomechanical properties of bone-patellar tendon-bone (BTB) allografts. Controlled laboratory study. Cyclic and failure mechanical properties were evaluated for 20 paired central-third human BTB allografts, with and without 1.0 to 1.2 Mrad of gamma irradiation. Testing included cyclic loading at 0.5 Hz for 100 cycles from 50 to 200 N and failure testing at a strain rate of 10% per second. Cyclic elongation did not change significantly (P = .151) with irradiation, increasing from a mean +/- SD of 9.4 +/- 2.1 mm to 11.3 +/- 3.4 mm. Cyclic creep strain approached a significant increase with irradiation (1.3% +/- 0.8% to 2.6% +/- 1.5%; P = .076). Failure testing was not affected with irradiation with regard to maximum load (1680 +/- 417 mm to 1494 +/- 435 mm), maximum stress (40.8 +/- 10.6 MPa to 37.5 +/- 15.7 MPa), elongation (7.85 +/- 1.35 mm to 8.67 +/- 2.05 mm), or strain at maximum stress (0.158 +/- 0.03 to 0.175 +/- 0.03). Graft stiffness significantly decreased by 20% with irradiation (278 +/- 67 N/mm to 221 +/- 50 N/mm; P = .035). Low-dose (1.0-1.2 Mrad) gamma irradiation decreases BTB graft stiffness by 20%, but it does not affect other failure or cyclic parameters. Aside from graft stiffness during load to failure testing, low-dose (1.0-1.2 Mrad) gamma irradiation of central-third human BTB allografts is not deleterious to preimplantation biomechanical properties.",Included

1996,"Rapid detection of radiation-induced chromosomal aberrations in lymphocytes and hematopoietic progenitor cells by mFISH. Structural chromosome aberrations (SCAs) are sensitive indicators of a preceding exposure of the hematopoietic system to ionizing radiation. Cytogenetic investigations have therefore become routine tools for an assessment of absorbed radiation doses and their biological effects after occupational exposure or radiation accidents.Due to its speed and ease of use, fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) with whole chromosome painting (WCP) probes has become a method of choice to visualize SCAs. Until recently, this technique was limited to a rather small number of chromosomes, which could be tested simultaneously. As a result, only a fraction of the structural aberrations present in a sample could be detected and the overall dose effect had to be calculated by extrapolation. The recent introduction of two genome-wide screening techniques in tumor research, i.e., Spectral Karyotyping (SKY) and multicolor FISH (mFISH) now allows the detection of translocations involving any two non-homologous chromosomes.The present study was prompted by our desire to bring the power of mFISH to bear for the rapid identification of radiation-induced SCAs. We chose two model systems to investigate the utility of mFISH: lymphocytes that were exposed in vitro to 3 Gy photons and single hematopoietic progenitor cell colonies isolated from a Chernobyl victim 9 years after in vivo exposure to 5.4 Sv.In lymphocytes, we found up to 15 different chromosomes involved in rearrangements indicating complex radiation effects. Stable aberrations detected in hematopoietic cell colonies, on the other hand, showed involvement of up to three different chromosomes. These results demonstrated that mFISH is a rapid and powerful approach to detect and characterize radiation-induced SCAs in the hemopoietic system. The application of mFISH is expected to result in a more detailed and, thus, more informative picture of radiation effects. Eventually, this technique will allow researchers to rapidly delineate chromosomal breakpoints and facilitate the identification of the genes involved in radiation tumorigenesis.

DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) which occurs in cells after ionizing radiation (IR) or chemical agents are the most dangerous lesions in eukariotic cells, which leads to cell death or chromosome abberations and cancer. One of the earliest response of cells to DSBs formation is phosphorylation by 139 serine of core variant histone H2AX in megabase chromatin domains around DSB (gamma-H2AX), which amplify signal and makes it possible to identify even one DSB in genome. Effective formation of gamma-H2AX is very important for maintenance of genome stability. Here, using immunofluorescent and Western blotting techniques, we studied dynamics of gamma-H2AX formation in human lymphocytes of various individuals irradiated ex vivo. We have found that dynamics of gamma-H2AX formation in lymphocytes differ between individuals but have similar kinetics and statistically is independent on people age.",Included

Purpose To assess the long-term disease control and toxicity outcomes of fractionated stereotactic radiation therapy (FSRT) in patients with pituitary adenomas treated at the BC Cancer Agency. Methods and Materials To ensure a minimum of 5 years of clinical follow-up, this study identified a cohort of 76 patients treated consecutively with FSRT between 1998 and 2007 for pituitary adenomas: 71% (54/76) had nonfunctioning and 29% (22/76) had functioning adenomas (15 adrenocorticotrophic hormone-secreting, 5 growth hormone-secreting, and 2 prolactin-secreting). Surgery was used before FSRT in 96% (73/76) of patients. A median isocenter dose of 50.4 Gy was delivered in 28 fractions, with 100% of the planning target volume covered by the 90% isodose. Patients were followed up clinically by endocrinologists, ophthalmologists, and radiation oncologists. Serial magnetic resonance imaging was used to assess tumor response. Results With a median follow-up time of 6.8 years (range, 0.6 - 13.1 years), the 7-year progression-free survival was 97.1% and disease-specific survival was 100%. Of the 2 patients with tumor progression, both had disease control after salvage surgery. Of the 22 patients with functioning adenomas, 50% (11/22) had complete and 9% (2/22) had partial responses after FSRT. Of the patients with normal pituitary function at baseline, 48% (14/29) experienced 1 or more hormone deficiencies after FSRT. Although 79% (60/76) of optic chiasms were at least partially within the planning target volumes, no patient experienced radiation-induced optic neuropathy. No patient experienced radionecrosis. No secondary malignancy occurred during follow-up.

At 40 days of age and older no effect was observed. This inhibition was a delayed phenomenon, dose-dependent and with no recovery.

Stomach cancer is a widespread health condition associated with environmental and genetic factors. Contribution of ionizing radiation to stomach cancer etiology is not sufficiently studied. This study was aimed to assess an association of the stomach cancer incidence risk with doses from occupational radiation exposure in a cohort of workers hired at main Mayak production association facilities in 1948-1982 taking into account non-radiation factors including digestive disorders. The study cohort comprised 22,377 individuals and by 31.12.2013 343 stomach cancer diagnoses had been reported among the cohort members. Occupational stomach absorbed doses were provided by the Mayak Worker Dosimetry System- 2008 (MWDS-2008) for external gamma ray exposure and by the Mayak Worker Dosimetry System- 2013 (MWDS-2013) for internal exposure to plutonium. Excess relative risks (ERR) per Gy for stomach cancer were estimated using the Poisson's regression. Analyses were run using the AMFIT module of the EPICURE software. The stomach cancer incidence risk in the study cohort was found to be significantly associated with the stomach absorbed dose of gamma rays: ERR/Gy = 0.19 (95% CI: 0.01, 0.44) with a 0 year lag, and ERR/Gy = 0.20 (95% CI: 0.01, 0.45) with a 5 year lag.

PURPOSE: To review trends in the use of postoperative radiotherapy (PORT) in the modern era for N0-N1 margin-negative non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) following surgical resection and evaluate the association between PORT dose and overall survival., MATERIALS AND METHODS: We performed a retrospective study of nonmetastatic stage II and III N0-N1 margin-negative NSCLC surgically treated patients within the National Cancer Data Base from 2003 to 2011. Cox proportional hazards regression was performed for multivariable analyses of overall survival and PORT dose. Radiation modalities included nonconformal beam radiation, 3-dimensional conformal radiation (3D-CRT), and intensity-modulated radiation therapy., RESULTS: We identified 2167 (6.7%) and 30,269 (93.3%) patients with surgically resected stage II or III N0-N1 margin-negative NSCLC who were treated with and without PORT, respectively. The proportion of patients treated with PORT (dose range, 45 to 74 Gy) decreased from 8.9% in 2003 to 2006 to 4.1% in 2010 to 2011. Among patients receiving PORT, the use of high-dose (60 to 74 Gy) PORT rose throughout the study period, starting at 34.8% in 2003 to 2006 and rising to 49.3% in 2010 to 2011.Overall, patients who received PORT had worse survival (hazards ratio=1.30; 95% confidence interval, 1.20-1.40) compared with those not receiving PORT. This association was unchanged when limited to patients receiving modern treatment with 3-CRT or intensity-modulated radiation therapy (hazards ratio=1.35; 95% confidence interval, 1.10-1.65)., CONCLUSIONS: The use of PORT for N0-N1 margin-negative NSCLC decreased from 2003 to 2011. We found no evidence of benefit from PORT for resected N0-N1 margin-negative NSCLC, regardless of dose or technique. PORT should be approached with caution in this group of patients, regardless of radiotherapy technique.",Included
2198,"Increased circulating cell-free DNA levels and mtDNA fragments in interventional cardiologists occupationally exposed to low levels of ionizing radiation. Circulating cell-free DNA (ccf-DNA) and mtDNA (ccf-mtDNA) have often been used as indicators of cell death and tissue damage in acute and chronic disorders, but little is known about changes in ccf-DNA and ccf-mtDNA concentrations following radiation exposure. The aim of the study was to investigate the impact of chronic low-dose radiation exposure on serum ccf-DNA levels and ccf-mtDNA fragments (mtDNA-79 and mtDNA-230) of interventional cardiologists working in high-volume cardiac catheterization laboratory to assess their possible role as useful radiation biomarkers. We enrolled 50 interventional cardiologists (26 males; age = 48.4 +/- 10 years) and 50 age- and gender-matched unexposed controls (27 males; age = 47.6 +/- 8.3 years). Quant-iT TM dsDNA High-Sensitivity assay was used to measure circulating ccf-DNA isolated from serum samples. Quantitative analysis of mtDNA fragments was performed by real-time PCR. No significant relationships were found between ccf-DNA and ccf-mtDNA, and age, gender, smoking, or other clinical parameters. Ccf-DNA levels (44.2 +/- 31.1 vs. 30.6 +/- 19.2 ng/ml, P = 0.013), ccf-mtDNA-79 (2.6 +/- 2.1 vs. 1.1 +/- 0.8, P < 0.01), and ccf-mtDNA-230 copies (2.0 +/- 1.8 vs. 1.04 +/- 0.9, P = 0.02) were significantly higher in interventional cardiologists compared with the non-exposed group. In a subset (n = 15) of interventional cardiologists with a reliable reconstruction of cumulative professional exposure (59.7 +/- 48.4 mSv; range: 1.4-182 mS), ccf-DNA (53.2 +/- 41.3 vs. 36.4 +/- 22.9 and 32.2 +/- 20.5, P = 0.08), mtDNA-79 (2.4 +/- 2.1 vs. 2.03 +/- 1.7 and 1.09 +/- 0.82, P = 0.05), and mtDNA-230 (2.0 +/- 2.2 vs. 1.5 +/- 1.4 and 1.04 +/- 0.9, P = 0.09) tended to be significantly increased in high-exposure subjects compared with both low-exposure interventional cardiologists and controls. Our results provide evidence for a possible role of circulating DNA as a relevant biomarker of cellular damage induced by exposure to chronic low-dose radiation.

2217,"Effects of gamma irradiation on mechanical properties of defatted trabecular bone allografts assessed by speed-of-sound measurement. New sterilization methods for human bone allografts may lead to alterations in bone mechanical properties, which strongly influence short- and medium-term outcomes. In many sterilization procedures, bone allografts are subjected to gamma irradiation, usually with 25 KGy, after treatment and packaging. We used speed-of-sound (SOS) measurements to evaluate the effects of gamma irradiation on bone. All bone specimens were subjected to the same microbial inactivation procedure. They were then separated into three groups, of which one was treated and not irradiated and two were exposed to 10 and 25 KGy of gamma radiation, respectively. SOS was measured using high- and low-frequency ultrasound beams in each orthogonal direction. SOS and Young modulus were altered significantly in the three groups, compared to native untreated bone. Exposure to 10 or 25 KGy had no noticeable effect on the study variables. The impact of irradiation was small compared to the effects of physical or chemical defatting. Reducing the radiation dose used in everyday practice failed to improve graft mechanical properties in this study. © Springer Science+Business Media, Inc. 2006.",Included
2223,"Preclinical studies with the Faure high energy neutron facility: response of pig skin to fractionated doses of fast neutrons (66 MeVp----Be). The early and late responses of pig skin to fractionated doses of both unfiltered and filtered (i.e. hardened) neutrons using the Faure neutron therapy facility (66 MeVp----Be) were determined and compared with those following fractionated doses with 60Co gamma-rays. Dose-effect curves for the quantal responses of moist desquamation (early epithelial response) and dermal necrosis (late response) were fitted by probit analysis and ED50 values obtained. For a neutron fractionation scheme comprised of 12 fractions in 26 days, and using an unfiltered beam, the ED50 values for moist desquamation and dermal necrosis were 18.67 +/- 2.22 and 22.25 +/- 0.48 Gy, respectively, whereas in the case of the filtered beam, the corresponding ED50 values were 24.78 +/- 1.44 and 23.30 +/- 0.47 Gy. In order to provide a comparison, the values for 24 fractions of 60Co gamma-rays given in 39 days (a clinical protocol used in the Groote Schuur Hospital) were 74.02 +/- 2.92 and 66.72 +/- 1.93 Gy for moist desquamation and dermal necrosis, respectively. For the unfiltered beam, values for the comparative biological effectiveness (CBE) were 3.96 and 3.00 for the early and late skin response, respectively. The corresponding CBE values were for the filtered beam 2.99 and 2.86. These results for the Faure neutron therapy facility can be extrapolated to the human situation with a high degree of confidence, so that the neutron dose which would yield acceptable skin damage in patients may be determined using the data presented here.",Included
2224,"Risk of cataract extraction among adult retinoblastoma survivors. Objective: To investigate the risk of cataract extraction among adult retinoblastoma survivors. Design(s): A retrospective cohort study was performed on retinoblastoma survivors who received the diagnosis from 1914 to 1984 and were interviewed in 2000. Lens doses were estimated from radiotherapy records. The cumulative time interval to cataract extraction between dose groups was compared using the log-rank test and Cox regression. Result(s): Seven hundred fifty-three subjects (828 eyes) were available for analysis for an average of 32 years of follow-up. During this period, 51 cataract extractions were reported. One extraction was reported in an eye with no radiotherapy compared with 36 extractions in 306 eyes with 1 course of radiotherapy and 14 among 38 eyes with 2 or 3 treatments. The average time interval to cataract extraction in irradiated eyes was 51 years (95% confidence interval [CI], 48-54) following 1 treatment and 32 years (95% CI, 27-37) after 2 or 3 treatments. Eyes exposed to a therapeutic radiation dose of 5 Gy or more had a 6-fold increased risk (95% CI, 1.3-27.2) of cataract extraction compared with eyes exposed to 2.5 Gy or less. Conclusion(s): The results emphasize the importance of ophthalmologic examination of retinoblastoma survivors who have undergone radiotherapy. The risk of cataract extraction in untreated eyes with retinoblastoma is comparable with the risk of the general population. ©2009 American Medical Association. All rights reserved.",Included

Dreyfuss, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, 76: 5910-5913, 1979), the tumor incidence was increased following irradiation (150 rads, 5 times, at weekly intervals), from 22 to 93% in females and from 5 to 59% in males. Experiments here reported suggest that 2 consecutive total-body gamma-irradiations of 150 rads each are sufficient to induce in rats the development of tumors, some malignant; 18 of 19 females (94.7%) developed tumors at an average age of 11.4 mo, and seven of the 14 males in this group (50%) developed tumors at an average age of 10.4 mo. In the second group, which received 3 consecutive gamma-irradiations, 20 of 23 females (86.9%) and 5 of 13 males (38.4%) developed tumors at average ages of 9.1 and 7.5 mo, respectively. In the third group, among rats which received 4 consecutive gamma-irradiations, 17 of 19 females (89.4%) and 4 of 12 males (33.3%) developed tumors at average ages of 9.4 and 10.5 mo, respectively. The etiology of tumors either developing spontaneously or induced by irradiation in rats remains to be clarified. Our attempts to detect virus particles by electron microscopy in such tumors or lymphomas have not been successful. As a working hypothesis, we are tempted to theorize that tumors or lymphomas developing spontaneously or induced by gamma irradiation in rats are caused by latent viral agents which are integrated into the cell genome and are cell associated, i.e., not separable from the rat tumor cells by conventional methods thus far used.",Included

Analysis of the relationship between dose and mortality from cancer and circulation diseases in the cohort of Chernobyl clean-up workers based on the data from the National Radiation and Epidemiological Registry was performed. Medical and dosimetry information on the clean-up workers, males, who got radiation doses from April 26, 1986 to April 26, 1987, which was accumulated from 1992 to 2012, was used for the analysis. The total size of the cohort was 42929 people, 12731 deaths were registered in the cohort, among them 1893 deaths from solid cancers and 5230 deaths were from circulation diseases. An average age of the workers was 39 years in 1992 and the mean dose was 164 mGy. The dose-effect relationship was estimated with the use of non-parametric analysis of survival with regard to concurrence of risks of mortality. The risks were estimated in 6 dose groups of similar size (1-70, 70-130, 130-190, 190-210, 210-230 and.230-1000 mGy). The group ""1-70 mGy"" was used as control. Estimated dose-effect relationship related to cancers and circulation diseases is described approximately with a linear model, coefficient of determination (the proportion of variability explained by the linear model) for cancers was 23-25% and for circulation diseases - 2-13%. The slope coefficient of the dose-effect relationship normalized to 1 Gy for the ratio of risks for cancers in the linear model was 0.47 (95% CI: -0.77, 1.71), and for circulation diseases it was 0.22 (95% CI: -0.58, 1.02). Risks coefficient (slope coefficient of excess mortality at a dose of 1 Gy) for solid cancers was 1.94 (95% CI: - 3.10, 7.00) x 10(-2) and for circulation diseases it was 0.67 (95% CI: -9.61, 11.00) x 10(-2). 137 deaths from radiation-induced cancers and 47 deaths from circulation diseases were registered during a follow up period.",Included
2315,"Sex and tissue-specific differences in low-dose radiation-induced oncogenic signaling. PURPOSE: The possible adverse health effects of low-dose radiation (LDR) exposure constitute a growing concern. Clinically and environmentally relevant exposures occur predominantly under chronic conditions, notwithstanding that most studies of LDR effects have been performed using a single acute exposure. Sex- and tissue-specificity of the LDR-induced changes have not been considered before. We investigated LDR-related expression patterns in muscle, liver and spleen of male and female mice subjected to acute and chronic LDR exposure. Genes involved in oncogenic signaling were of specific interest, as radiation is a well-known carcinogen., MATERIALS AND METHODS: We analyzed the expression pattern of genes coding for growth factors and growth-factor receptors, cytoplasmic serine/threonine protein kinases, G-proteins and nuclear DNA-binding proteins, and other important components of oncogenic signaling., RESULTS: We found sex- and tissue-specific changes in the expression of Ras superfamily members (Nras, Rab2, Rab34, Vav2), protein kinase C (PKC) isoforms (PKCbeta, PKCmu), AP-1 factor components (Jun, JunB and FosB), Wnt signaling pathway members as well as in a variety of other cellular proto-oncogenes and oncogenes. Importantly, Western blot analysis of JunB, PKCmu and Rab2 proteins supported the transcriptomic data., CONCLUSIONS: Substantially different protein levels were observed in all three tissues (muscle, spleen and liver) of acutely and chronically irradiated female and male animals. Based on the obtained data and available literature, we discuss several possible mechanisms that may contribute to radiation-induced carcinogenesis in various tissues of males and females. From our results we could identify the genes that may serve as sex- and tissue-specific biomarkers of the LDR exposure.",Included

The number of splenic rosette-forming cells (RFC) in the intact spleen was very low but greatly increased after sublethal whole body x-irradiation. These cells were inhibited by pretreatment of the cells with AKR anti-C3H- antigen antiserum, in the presence of fresh guinea pig serum, but not with rabbit anti-mouse immunoglobulin antiserum. The splenic RFC also increased after cortisone acetate administration into mice. These results suggest that the RFC are a T cell sub-population having x-ray resistant and cortisone-insensitive characteristics. The x-irradiation of mice in vivo selectively increased the number of splenic RFC in consequence of reduction in the number of cells having non-T cell characteristics. These RFC are presumably antigen-specific sheep red blood cell rosettes, a quite different situation as in the case of human T lymphocyte rosette formation.",Included

OBJECTIVE: Recent studies suggested that head and neck radiotherapy increases active forms of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) in the dentin-enamel junction (DEJ), leading to enamel delamination and radiation-related caries. This study aimed to assess the expression and activity of the gelatinases MMP-2 and MMP-9 in the DEJ and dentin-pulp complex tissues of teeth irradiated in vivo., STUDY DESIGN: Thirty-six teeth were studied, including 19 irradiated and 17 non-irradiated controls. In situ zymography was used to investigate the gelatinolytic activity in the micromorphologic components of enamel, DEJ, dentin-pulp complex, and caries. Immunohistochemical analysis was conducted on the demineralized samples to assess MMP-2 and MMP-9 expression levels in the DEJ, dentin-pulp complex components, and caries., RESULTS: No statistically significant differences were detected between groups in gelatinolytic activity or in MMP-2 expression levels (P > .05). Odontoblast MMP-9 expression was reduced in the irradiated group (P = .02)., CONCLUSIONS: The study rejected the hypothesis that MMP-2 and MMP-9 would be overexpressed or more activated in the DEJ and dentin-pulp complex of irradiated teeth.

AIM: The aim of this study was to assess the expression of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) as a key proangiogenic factor and determine whether there is any correlation between its expression and clinical symptoms or endoscopic changes in patients with chronic radiation proctitis (ChRP)., METHOD: Fifty patients who had all undergone radiotherapy for prostate, cervical or uterine cancer were included in the study (37 women, 13 men). There was a control group of 20 patients (9 women, 11 men). The Radiation Therapy Oncology Group/European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (RTOG/EORTC) scoring system was used for grading the severity of the proctitis. Endoscopic scoring of late rectal mucosal damage was performed using Gilinsky's classification. Serum levels of VEGF were analysed by the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay method., RESULTS: Most patients presented with Grade 1 symptoms. Endoscopic assessment showed that most patients had Grade 1 late rectal mucosal damage. The predominant endoscopic finding was the presence of telangiectasia. Assessment of VEGF correlation between the control group and the degrees of endoscopic changes showed statistically significant differences for all three degrees (P < 0.0001, P = 0.0251 and P = 0.0005, respectively). Due to the small numbers of patients with Grades 2 and 3 symptoms using the RTOG/EORTC scoring system, they were grouped with Grades 1 and 4 respectively forming two groups for statistical purposes. VEGF expression differed significantly between controls and group I and between controls and group II (P = 0.0001, P = 0.0009, respectively)., CONCLUSION: A significant increase in VEGF expression was found to correlate with clinical symptoms and endoscopic rectal mucosa changes in patients with ChRP, suggesting that it may play an important role in pathological angiogenesis.

Dysfunction of the intestinal epithelial barrier and leakage of luminal antigens and bacteria across the barrier have been linked to various human diseases. Intestinal permeability is regulated by intercellular structures, termed ""tight junction"" (Tj), which are disrupted after total-body irradiation (TBI). In this study, we investigated radiation-induced alterations in Tj-related proteins in the jejunum, ileum and colon of a non-human primate (NHP) model. NHPs were total-body irradiated with 6.7 and 7.4 Gy and intestines were procured at day 4, 7 and 12. Radiation exposure was found to induce significant increases in claudin-10 mRNA early (day 4) in all three gut segments and claudin-4 mRNA levels were repressed through day 12. TNF-alpha was highly induced in the jejunum and colon at early time points, but little induction was found in the ileum. Claudin-1 was induced only in the colon on day 4 postirradiation. Unlike the colon and jejunum, the ileum levels of claudin-7 were significantly downregulated through day 12 postirradiation. Western blot analysis revealed increased levels of claudin-2 on day 4 and of JAM-1 on day 7 postirradiation in all three gut segments. E-cadherin was downregulated on day 4 postirradiation in all segments, but remained reduced in the jejunum only until day 12. Taken together, these data suggest that exposure to radiation causes segment-specific alterations in the expression of Tj-related proteins. Interruption of Tjs may be a key factor contributing to injury to the intestinal mucosal barrier and increased intestinal permeability.",Included
2435,"Altered mechanical behavior of demineralized bone following therapeutic radiation. Post-radiotherapy (RTx) bone fragility fractures are a late-onset complication occurring in bone within or underlying the radiation field. These fractures are difficult to predict, as patients do not present with local osteopenia. Using a murine hindlimb RTx model, we previously documented decreased mineralized bone strength and fracture toughness, but alterations in material properties of the organic bone matrix are largely unknown. In this study, 4 days of fractionated hindlimb irradiation (4 x 5 Gy) or Sham irradiation was administered in a mouse model (BALB/cJ, end points: 0, 4, 8, and 12 weeks, n = 15/group/end point). Following demineralization, the viscoelastic stress relaxation, and monotonic tensile mechanical properties of tibiae were determined. Irradiated tibiae demonstrated an immediate (day after last radiation fraction) and sustained (4, 8, 12 weeks) increase in stress relaxation compared to the Sham group, with a 4.4% decrease in equilibrium stress (p <.017). While tensile strength was not different between groups, irradiated tibiae had a lower elastic modulus (-5%, p =.027) and energy to failure (-12.2%, p =.012) with monotonic loading. Gel electrophoresis showed that therapeutic irradiation (4 x 5 Gy) does not result in collagen fragmentation, while irradiation at a common sterilization dose (25 kGy) extensively fragmented collagen. These results suggest that altered collagen mechanical behavior has a role in postirradiation bone fragility, but this can occur without detectable collagen fragmentation. Statement of Clinical Significance: Therapeutic irradiation alters bone organic matrix mechanics and which contribute to diminished fatigue strength, but this does not occur via collagen fragmentation.Copyright © 2020 Orthopaedic Research Society.

Results showed that chronic exposure causes the reduction of hair thickness in female radiation workers than nurses. The hair root,hair nutrition,hair status and hair oil in groups showed no significant difference to each other. However,there was no significant difference in hair parameters between male radiation workers and male non radiation workers. Although attention to safety in working with radiation has increased,damage caused by radiation has not yet been reduced to zero. Results of the study showed that chronic exposure may cause damage to the hair of radiation workers.

The aim of this research was to evaluate the relationship between p53 protein levels and absorbed doses from in vitro irradiated human lymphocytes. For this, samples of blood from 23 donors were irradiated with 0.5; 1; 2; and 4 Gy from a Cobalt-60 source, and the percentages of lymphocytes expressing p53 were scored using Flow Cytometry. The subjects were divided into 3 groups, in accordance with the p53 levels expressed per radiation dose: low (Group I), high (Group II), and excessive levels (Group III). For all groups, the analyses showed that the p53 expression levels increase with the absorbed dose. Particularly for groups I and II, the correlation between this protein expression and the dose follows the linear-quadratic model, such as for radioinduced chromosomal aberrations. In conclusion, our findings indicate possible applications of this approach in evaluating individual radiosensitivity prior to radiotherapeutical procedures as well as in medical surveillance of occupationally exposed workers. Furthermore, due to the rapidity of flow-cytometric analyses, the methodology here employed would play an important role in emergency responses to a large-scale radiation incident where many people may have been exposed.",Included

OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the risk for all-cause and cause-specific mortality in diagnostic medical radiation workers in South Korea., METHODS: The study population included all diagnostic medical radiation workers enrolled in the National Dosimetry Registry (NDR) between 1996 and 2011. NDR data were linked with mortality data obtained from national registries through 2015. Standardised mortality ratios (SMRs) and relative standardised mortality ratios (rSMRs) were calculated for external comparison and for adjustment of the cohort's overall healthiness., RESULTS: A total of 1099 deaths (974 in men and 125 in women) were reported from among 80 837 medical radiation workers. The SMRs for all causes of death were significantly lower than expected in both men (SMR 0.45, 95% CI 0.42 to 0.48) and women (SMR 0.49, 95% CI 0.41 to 0.58). No excesses were observed for any specific cause of death. The findings were similar by job title, calendar year of entry and year of birth. However, relative to all causes of death, mortality from all cancers (rSMR 1.60, 95% CI 1.41 to 1.82), leukaemia, colon cancer, stomach cancer and diseases of the circulatory system increased significantly among male workers. The results for female workers were limited due to small number of deaths; however, the rSMR for all cancers was significantly elevated (rSMR 1.70, 95% CI 1.17 to 2.46)., CONCLUSIONS: This cohort showed lower mortality among diagnostic medical radiation workers than in the general population.

BACKGROUND: Animals living in areas contaminated by radioactive material from Chernobyl suffer from increased oxidative stress and low levels of antioxidants. Therefore, normal development of the nervous system is jeopardized as reflected by high frequencies of developmental errors, reduced brain size and impaired cognitive abilities in humans. Alternatively, associations between psychological effects and radiation have been attributed to post-traumatic stress in humans., METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDING: Here we used an extensive sample of 550 birds belonging to 48 species to test the prediction that even in the absence of post-traumatic stress, there is a negative association between relative brain size and level of background radiation. We found a negative association between brain size as reflected by external head volume and level of background radiation, independent of structural body size and body mass. The observed reduction in brain size in relation to background radiation amounted to 5% across the range of almost a factor 5,000 in radiation level. Species differed significantly in reduction in brain size with increasing background radiation, and brain size was the only morphological character that showed a negative relationship with radiation. Brain size was significantly smaller in yearlings than in older individuals., CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Low dose radiation can have significant effects on normal brain development as reflected by brain size and therefore potentially cognitive ability. The fact that brain size was smaller in yearlings than in older individuals implies that there was significant directional selection on brain size with individuals with larger brains experiencing a viability advantage.",Included
2562,"Toxicity Related to Radiotherapy Dose and Targeting Strategy: A Pooled Analysis of Cooperative Group Trials of Combined Modality Therapy for Locally Advanced Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer. OBJECTIVE: Concurrent chemoradiotherapy (CRT) was the standard treatment for locally advanced NSCLC (LA-NSCLC). This study was performed to examine thoracic radiotherapy (TRT) parameters and their impact on adverse events (AEs)., METHODS: We collected individual patient data from 3600 patients with LA-NSCLC who participated in 16 cooperative group trials of concurrent CRT. The TRT parameters examined included field design strategy (elective nodal irradiation [ENI] versus involved-field [IF] TRT [IF-TRT]) and TRT dose (60 Gy versus >=60 Gy). The primary end point of this analysis was the occurrence of AEs. ORs for AEs were calculated with univariable and multivariable logistic models., RESULTS: TRT doses ranged from 60 to 74 Gy. ENI was not associated with more grade 3 or higher AEs than IF-TRT was (multivariable OR = 0.77, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.543-1.102, p = 0.1545). Doses higher than 60 Gy (high-dose TRT) were associated with significantly more grade 3 or higher AEs (multivariable OR = 1.82, 95% CI: 1.501-2.203, p < 0.0001). In contrast, ENI was associated with significantly more grade 4 or higher AEs (multivariable OR = 1.33, 95% CI: 1.035-1.709, p = 0.0258). Doses higher than 60 Gy were also associated with more grade 4 or higher AEs (multivariate OR = 1.42, 95% CI: 1.191-1.700, p = 0.0001). Grade 5 AEs plus treatment-related deaths were more frequent with higher-dose TRT (p = 0.0012) but not ENI (p = 0.099)., CONCLUSIONS: For patients with LA-NSCLC treated with concurrent CRT, IF-TRT was not associated with the overall risk of grade 3 or higher AEs but was associated with significantly fewer grade 4 or higher AEs than ENI TRT. This is likely the result of irradiation of a lesser amount of adjacent critical normal tissue. Higher TRT doses were associated significantly with grade 3 or higher and grade 4 or higher AEs. On the basis of these findings and our prior report on survival, CRT using IF-TRT and 60 Gy (conventionally fractionated) were associated with more favorable patient survival and less toxicity than was the use of ENI or higher radiotherapy doses.

BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Irradiation of ocular pterygium is considered a valuable treatment supplementation after surgical therapy. Since prospective randomized trials are scare and only limited patient data are available, the aim of this study was to evaluate the patient population treated with fractioned 90Sr irradiation after surgical pterygium resection., PATIENTS AND METHODS: Between September 1993 and March 2001, 1,147 patients with pterygium lesions (1,320 lesions) were treated surgically and with 90Sr postoperative beta-irradiation. A total dose of 30 Gy was used for patients treated within 48 h after surgery, while those treated>48 h postoperatively received a total dose of 35 Gy. A minimum follow-up period of 3 months was required for inclusion in the analysis, and 1,253 lesions were ultimately analyzed., RESULTS: Recurrence of the pterygium after postoperative 90Sr irradiation was observed in 97 of 1,253 cases (7.7%). Statistical analysis (uni- and multivariate) revealed, that male gender, younger age (<40 years), prior treatment (surgery and radiotherapy) and immediate irradiation (<2 h after surgery) were negative predictors for local recurrence. Temporary radiotherapy-induced side effects were observed in 15.2% of patients, including moderate conjunctivitis, local pain, visual disturbance and photophobia or an increase in tear flow. However, no long-term serious side effects were documented., CONCLUSION: 90Sr irradiation of pterygium after surgery represents a safe and effective treatment option to prevent disease recurrence. The data obtained in this study indicate that a certain interval after surgery might improve therapy outcome.",Included

Little information is available on the health effects of exposures to fallout from Soviet nuclear weapons testing and on the combined external and internal environmental exposures that have resulted from these tests. This paper reports the first analysis of the Semipalatinsk historical cohort exposed in the vicinity of the Semipalatinsk nuclear test site, Kazakhstan. The cohort study, which includes 19,545 inhabitants of exposed and comparison villages of the Semipalatinsk region, was set up in the 1960s and comprises 582,750 person-years of follow-up between 1960 and 1999. Cumulative effective radiation dose estimates in this cohort range from 20 mSv to approximately 4 Sv. Rates of mortality and cancer mortality in the exposed group substantially exceeded those of the comparison group. Dose-response analyses within the exposed group confirmed a significant trend with dose for all solid cancers (P < 0.0001) and for digestive and respiratory cancers (P = 0.0255 and P < 0.0001), whereas no consistent dose-response trend was found for all causes of death (P = 0.4296). Regarding specific cancer sites, a significant trend with dose was observed for lung cancer (P = 0.0001), stomach cancer (P = 0.0050), and female breast cancer (P = 0.0040) as well as for esophagus cancer in women (P = 0.0030). The excess relative risk per sievert for all solid cancers combined was 1.77 (1.35; 2.27) based on the total cohort data, yet a selection bias regarding the comparison group could not be entirely ruled out. The excess relative risk per sievert based on the cohort's exposed group was 0.81 (0.46; 1.33) for all solid cancers combined and thus still exceeds current risk estimates from the Life Span Study. Future epidemiological assessments based on this cohort will benefit from extension of follow-up and ongoing validation of dosimetric data.",Included

The study was carried out on 18 experimental guinea pigs subjected to 5 successive exposures of 150 rads 3 or 4 days apart. The control animals were sham radiated but were otherwise treated identically as those of the experimental groups. Blood samples were taken by cardiac puncture before radiation and 30 min after each exposure of 150 rads. The red cells were re-suspended in their own plasma and HMP pathway activity was measured in the suspension. The pathway activity showed a consistent but minor reduction in the experimental group, which became statistically significant after the total dose of 750 rads (P less than 0.020). In a separate study the changes induced by ionizing radiation in the erythrocyte enzyme NADH-methemoglobin reductase were measured using the same experimental protocol. The enzyme activity in the red cells of the experimental group varied between 34.90 +/- 2.17 to 161.95 +/- 5.34 I.U./ml erythrocyte pack. Its activity declined toward the initial value after reaching the peak by the 12th day of ionizing radiation with 600 rads (P less than 0.001).",Included

PURPOSE: Lower radiation tolerance of the whole liver hinders dose escalations of stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) treatment. This study was conducted to define the exact doses that result in radiation-induced liver disease (RILD) as well as to determine dose constraints for the critical organs at risk (OARs) in mice; these parameters are still undefined in HCC SBRT., METHODS: This study consisted of two phases. In the primary phase, mice treated with helical tomotherapy-based SBRT were stratified according to escalating radiation doses to the livers. The pathological differences, signs [such as mouse performance status (MPS)], and serum aspartate aminotransferase (AST)/alanine aminotransferase (ALT)/albumin levels were observed. Radiation-induced disease severities of the OARs were scored using systematic evaluation standards. In the validation phase in humans, 13 patients with HCC who had undergone radiotherapy before hepatectomy were enrolled to validate RILD pathological changes in a mouse study., RESULTS: The evaluation criteria of the mouse liver radiotherapy-related signs were as follows: MPS >= 2.0 +/- 0.52, AST/ALT >= 589.2 +/- 118.5/137.4 +/- 15.3 U/L, serum albumin <= 16.8 +/- 2.29 g/L. The preliminary dose constraints of the OARs were also obtained, such as those for the liver (average dose <= 26.36 +/- 1.71 Gy) and gastrointestinal tract (maximum dose <= 22.63 Gy). Mouse RILD models were able to be developed when the livers were irradiated with average doses of >=31.76 +/- 1.94 Gy (single fraction). RILD pathological changes in mice have also been validated in HCC patients., CONCLUSIONS: Mouse RILD models could be developed with SBRT based on the dose constraints for the OARs and evaluation criteria of mouse liver radiotherapy-related signs, and the authors' results favor the study of further approaches to treat HCC with SBRT.",Included

Background: Considering that thyroid nodules and thyroid cancer occur more frequently in people chronically exposed to radiation, the aim of this study was to evaluate the prevalence of thyroid nodules in a population occupationally exposed to radiation in hospitals of Isfahan, Iran. Material(s) and Method(s): In this case-control study, the prevalence of thyroid nodules in staff members occupationally exposed to radiation was determined by ultrasonography. The results were compared with the results of another study among the adult population of Isfahan which selected by cluster random sampling method. The 2 studied groups were matched according to sex and age. Result(s): The case and control groups included 124 and 471 persons, respectively. The prevalence of thyroid nodules in the case and control groups was 22.6% and 24.6%, respectively (p > 0.05). Although thyroid nodules were significantly more prevalent in females in the control group, no such difference was observed between females and males of the case group (p > 0.05). The number of thyroid nodules (single or multiple) and calcification were not different between the two groups (p > 0.05). In addition, hypoechogenicity of thyroid nodules was not different between the two groups for (p > 0.05).

BACKGROUND: The purpose of this study was to assess the late side effects of radioiodine therapy (RIT) on salivary gland function. One hundred eighty two patients were evaluated., METHODS: Assessment of salivary gland function was performed with salivary gland scintigraphy (SGS), sialometry, and subjective open questions to determine common side effects of RIT on salivary gland function., RESULTS: RIT had a strong association with decreased elimination counts by SGS. Patient age was the only variable associated with sialometry; age and the use of xerostomic drugs were strongly associated with decreased mean values of salivary flow. Dysphagia was strongly associated with RIT. Using multiple logistic regression analysis, age was determined to be an important factor associated with salivary gland dysfunction, and RIT was associated with impairment of saliva excretion., CONCLUSION: These results show that patients subjected to RIT have more difficulty in draining saliva, mainly from the parotid glands, which is associated with clinical dysphagia in this subset of patients.

2748,"Effects of X-rays and cigarette smoking on leukocyte, lymphocyte and mitotic index values and SCE rates: the relationship between mitotic index and lymphocyte count. Many previous studies revealed that smoking increases leukocyte and lymphocyte counts while exposure to X-rays decreases these counts. However the relationships between lymphocyte life span and smoking as well as X-rays were not well documented. The primary aim of this study was to determine relationships between smoking X-rays (in combination and individually) and life span of lymphocytes. Blood samples from 200 healthy individuals, half of which were X-ray exposed individuals, were collected. Half of X-ray exposed and of non-X-ray exposed individuals were smokers. There were equal numbers of male and female participants. Two lymphocyte cultures, one for the sister chromatid exchange (SCE) analysis and the other for the determination of mitotic index values were prepared using one part of the blood samples collected from the individuals. From the other part of the blood sample leukocyte and lymphocyte counts were determined with a haemogram device. Evaluation of the findings suggested that leukocyte count, lymphocyte count, mitotic index were relatively lower for the X-ray exposed individuals. In addition these values were higher for smokers than nonsmokers in general. The highest SCE rates were recorded for smoking radiology technicians. The most important finding is that lymphocyte life span is relatively low in smokers and in X-ray exposed males.",Included
2749,"Changes in symptom clusters in patients undergoing radiation therapy. GOALS OF WORK: The goals of the study were to determine the occurrence rates for and the severity of symptoms at the middle, end, and 1 month after the completion of radiation therapy (RT), to determine the number and types of symptom clusters at these three time points, and to evaluate for changes over time in these symptom clusters., MATERIALS AND METHODS: Symptom occurrence and severity were evaluated using the Memorial Symptom Assessment Scale (MSAS) in a sample of patients (n = 160) who underwent RT for breast or prostate cancer. At each time point, an exploratory factor analysis was done to determine the number of symptom clusters (i.e., symptom factors) based on the MSAS symptom severity ratings., MAIN RESULTS: The majority of the patients were male and married with a mean age of 61.1 years. The five symptoms with the highest occurrence rates across all three time points were lack of energy, pain, difficulty sleeping, feeling drowsy, and sweats. Although the number of symptoms and the specific symptoms within each symptom cluster were not identical across the three time points, three relatively similar symptom clusters (i.e., mood-cognitive"" symptom cluster, ""sickness-behavior"" symptom cluster, ""treatment-related"", or ""pain"" symptom cluster) were identified in this sample. The internal consistency coefficients for the mood-cognitive symptom cluster and sickness-behavior symptom cluster were adequate at > or =0.68., CONCLUSIONS: Three relatively stable symptom clusters were found across RT.

2761,"Do persons living near a uranium processing site have evidence of increased somatic cell gene mutations? A first study. The objective of this study was to examine if individuals living near a uranium processing site have greater mutagenic damage, as measured by three mutagenicity assays, compared with subjects unexposed to any nuclear facilities. The design was a cross-sectional exploratory analysis of 112 subjects; 56 volunteer residents were from within a 5-mile radius of the Fernald Uranium Processing site and 56 'control' subjects were from a geographically separate area unexposed to any known uranium emissions. The groups were constrained to be similar in age and sex composition. The main outcome measures were three human somatic gene mutation assays consisting of the HPRT T-lymphocyte cloning assay to measure 6-thioguanine resistant lymphocytes; the glycophorin A assay to detect the loss of expression of the M or N allele; and the micronucleus assay as a marker of chromosomal damage. The results showed no statistically significant or quantitatively important differences between groups for all three mutagenicity assays; only the unselected cloning efficiency was statistically significantly different between groups (0.42 +/- 0.16 for the Fernald versus 0.35 +/- 0.12 for the comparison groups). In both groups, age was significantly related to HPRT mutant frequency, with a 1.25% rate of increase in mutant frequencies for each 1-year gain of age in the Fernald group and a 1.12% rate of increase in mutant frequencies for each 1-year gain of age in the comparison group. For the micronucleus data, females had a greater mean micronucleus frequency than males. In addition, smokers had an increased mean ln (natural logarithm) HPRT mutant frequency (3.06 +/- 0.14 for current smokers compared with a mean of 2.72 +/- 0.05 for non-current (i.e. never plus former) smokers). Our results are consistent with the previously reported association between sex type and micronucleus frequency, the known relationship between age and T-lymphocyte cloning efficiency and age and HPRT mutant frequency, and verify the wide inter-subject variability for the latter. Finally, we conclude that at a population level, the relationships between current cigarette use and HPRT mutant frequency, and sex type and micronucleus frequency, are stronger than is the association between geographic proximity to a uranium processing site and mutagenic abnormalities.",Included

Severe radiation exposure may cause acute radiation syndrome, a possibly fatal condition requiring effective therapy. Gut microbiota can be manipulated to fight against many diseases. We explored whether intestinal microbe transplantation could alleviate radiation-induced toxicity. High-throughput sequencing showed that gastrointestinal bacterial community composition differed between male and female mice and was associated with susceptibility to radiation toxicity. Faecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) increased the survival rate of irradiated animals, elevated peripheral white blood cell counts and improved gastrointestinal tract function and intestinal epithelial integrity in irradiated male and female mice. FMT preserved the intestinal bacterial composition and retained mRNA and long non-coding RNA expression profiles of host small intestines in a sex-specific fashion. Despite promoting angiogenesis, sex-matched FMT did not accelerate the proliferation of cancer cells in vivo. FMT might serve as a therapeutic to mitigate radiation-induced toxicity and improve the prognosis of tumour patients after radiotherapy.Copyright © 2017 The Authors.

2793,"First analysis of cancer incidence and occupational radiation exposure based on the National Dose Registry of Canada. A cohort study was conducted to investigate the relation between cancer incidence and occupational exposure to ionizing radiation. Records containing dose information from 1951 to 1988 for 191,333 persons were extracted from the National Dose Registry of Canada. The records were linked to the Canadian Cancer Data Base, with incidence data from 1969 to 1988. Standardized incidence ratios were calculated using Canadian cancer incidence rates stratified by age, sex, and calendar year. Excess relative risks were obtained from internally based dose-response analyses. The following significant results were found for males and females combined: a deficit in the standardized incidence ratio for all cancers combined; elevated standardized incidence ratios for thyroid cancer and melanoma; and elevated excess relative risks for rectum, leukemia, lung, all cancers combined, all except lung, and all except leukemia. For males, cancers of the colon, pancreas, and testis also showed significantly elevated excess relative risks. The specific cancer types listed above have been implicated in previous studies on occupational exposure to ionizing radiation, except for testis, colon, and melanoma, while the findings on thyroid cancer from previous studies are inconclusive.

2799,"DNA Damage Baseline Predicts Resilience to Space Radiation and Radiotherapy. Deep space exploration will require real-time, minimally invasive monitoring of astronaut health to mitigate the potential health impairments caused by space radiation and microgravity. Genotoxic stress in humans can be monitored by quantifying the amount of DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) in immune cells from a simple finger prick. In a cohort of 674 healthy donors, we show that the endogenous level of DSBs increases with age and with latent cytomegalovirus infection. To map the range of human responses to space radiation, we then study DSB induction and repair in immune cells from 319 healthy donors after the cells are exposed to galactic cosmic ray components and lymphocytes from 30 cancer patients after radiotherapy. Individuals with low baseline DSB have fewer clinical complications, enhanced DNA damage repair responses, and a functional dose-dependent cytokine response in healthy donor cells. This supports the use of DSB monitoring for health resilience in space., Pariset et al. find that individuals with a lower baseline level of DNA damage are resilient to clinical complications after radiotherapy and present higher radiation-induced levels of DNA repair foci and inflammatory cytokines. These findings support the use of baseline DNA damage as a biomarker for radiation sensitivity.Copyright © 2020",Included
2812,"Radiation and host factors in human thyroid tumors following thymus irradiation. In this paper thyroid tumor data from the 1971 survey of the Rochester, New York thymus irradiated population are further analyzed to study radiobiological and host factors. The analyses were based on the approximately 2650 irradiated subjects and 4800 sibling controls who had 5 or more years of follow-up. Twenty-four thyroid cancers and 52 thyroid adenomas were found in the irradiated group, and 0 thyroid cancers and 6 adenomas among the controls. The overall risk estimates were 3.8 thyroid cancers/106 PY-rad and 4.5 thyroid adenomas/106 PY-rad. The dose-response data (thyroid dose range of 5 to > 1000 rad) for thyroid cancer indicate both a linear and a dose-squared component, but no dose-squared component is evident for thyroid adenomas. At lower total doses (< 400 rad) there was a suggestion that dose fractionation diminished the thyroid cancer response, but a similar fractionation effect was not found for thyroid adenomas. The temporal pattern of tumors suggested an extended plateau of excess tumor production, rather than a 'wavelike' temporal pattern. There was no evidence for an inverse relationship between thyroid radiation dose and thyroid cancer latency. Female and Jewish subjects had a higher risk of radiation-induced thyroid cancer than did their respective counterparts. The additive and multiplicative models of radiation effects were compared with respect to sex differences; neither model provided a superior fit to the data. The tentative nature of the conclusion is stressed because of the relatively small number of thyroid cancers.",Included
2823,"Intestinal and colonic motor alterations associated with irradiation-induced diarrhoea in rats. Localized application of ionizing radiation to the gastrointestinal tract frequently elicits responses, which include diarrhoea. The origin of this symptom is not clear but has been attributed to loss of epithelial integrity, together with alterations in motility and increased secretion. The purpose of this study was to examine whether a 10 Gy abdominal gamma irradiation leads to an inflammatory reaction, and to compare intestinal and colonic motility in controls and abdominally irradiated rats 1, 3 and 7 days after irradiation, using an electromyographic technique. The motility parameters analysed were the frequency and velocity of propagation of migrating myoelectric complexes (MMC) in the jejunum and colonic spike activity (long spike bursts; LSB) per 10 min in fasted rats. The MMC frequency was significantly reduced on days 1 and 7 after irradiation and the MMC pattern was markedly disrupted on day 3. The frequency of colonic LSB was significantly reduced on days 1, 3 and 7. Mouth to anus transit was significantly accelerated on day 3 only and diarrhoea was observed at this time. Myeloperoxidase activity in the jejunum and colon was also increased on this day only. It is concluded that irradiation-induced diarrhoea occurs contemporaneously with disruption of MMC in the small intestine.",Included

Background: Osseous cyst echinococcosis (CE) is an infectious disease that causes disability and deformity in patients, yet there is still no satisfactory treatment. Focusing on the feasibility and prognosis of radiotherapy as an adjuvant or palliative treatment for osseous CE, this study investigated the outcome of Meriones meridianus with osseous CE after radiotherapy., Methods: The study utilized a comparison control group design with three groups of gerbils, and 240 osseous CE gerbils were randomly divided into control, 40Gy/5times, and 50Gy/5times groups. Different doses of radiotherapy were given to the gerbils, and then, the effects of radiotherapy on gerbils and lesions were observed at 3 and 6 months after radiotherapy. Statistical analysis was done using chi 2 test, unpaired t-test, and one-way ANOVA., Results: Significant changes (P < 0.05) were achieved between the three groups in terms of seven parameters at 3 and 6 months, including the number of dead gerbils and lesion sites with ulceration and infection, number of dead scolices, protein content, Ca2+ concentration, the maximum diameter of lesion site, and wet weight of cysts. Except for the number of dead gerbils and lesion sites with ulceration and infection, all other parameters were observed a big difference between 3 months and 6 months in the 50Gy/5times group., Conclusion: Radiotherapy at a dose of 50 Gy has inhibitory and therapeutic effects on osseous CE in gerbils, and radiotherapy could probably be a treatment option for persistent or recurrent osseous CE.

2839,"miRNA-95 mediates radioresistance in tumors by targeting the sphingolipid phosphatase SGPP1. Radiation resistance poses a major clinical challenge in cancer treatment, but little is known about how microRNA (miR) may regulate this phenomenon. In this study, we used next-generation sequencing to perform an unbiased comparison of miR expression in PC3 prostate cancer cells rendered resistant to fractionated radiation treatment. One miR candidate found to be upregulated by ionizing radiation was miR-95, the enforced expression of which promoted radiation resistance in a variety of cancer cells. miR-95 overexpression recapitulated an aggressive phenotype including increased cellular proliferation, deregulated G2-M checkpoint following ionizing radiation, and increased invasive potential. Using combined in silico prediction and microarray expression analyses, we identified and validated the sphingolipid phosphatase SGPP1, an antagonist of sphingosine-1-phosphate signaling, as a target of miR-95 that promotes radiation resistance. Consistent with this finding, cell treatment with FTY720, a clinically approved small molecule inhibitor of S1P signaling, sensitized miR-95 overexpressing cells to radiation treatment. In vivo assays extended the significance of these results, showing that miR-95 overexpression increased tumor growth and resistance to radiation treatment in tumor xenografts. Furthermore, reduced tumor necrosis and increased cellular proliferation were seen after radiation treatment of miR-95 overexpressing tumors compared with control tumors. Finally, miR-95 expression was increased in human prostate and breast cancer specimens compared with normal tissue. Together, our work reveals miR-95 expression as a critical determinant of radiation resistance in cancer cells.",Included
2840,"Radioprotective effects of exogenous glutathione against whole-body gamma-ray irradiation: age- and gender-related changes in malondialdehyde levels, superoxide dismutase and catalase activities in rat liver. Age- and gender-related changes in malondialdehyde (MDA) levels, superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase (CAT) activities in rat livers exposed to different doses of whole-body gamma-ray radiation were determined. In addition, the effects of exogenous glutathione (GSH) against radiation injury in rat livers were investigated. We found that MDA levels have an age-associated increment and an increasing radiation dose-related elevation, although they decrease slightly in the 4 Gy group. The MDA levels in old rats were lower in males than in females, while those of young rats did not change. There were no observed age-related changes in SOD activities, although male rats had higher SOD activity than females. Female rats had the highest CAT activities in the 4 Gy group, while male rats had the highest CAT activities in the 6 Gy group. CAT activities in the 8 Gy group were lower than those of the 2 Gy group for each gender and age. While MDA levels were decreased and CAT activities increased by GSH, SOD activities remained unchanged. The results indicate that gamma-ray radiation affects gender- and age-dependent MDA levels, SOD and CAT activities. Administration of GSH appears to be a useful approach to reduce radiation injury by reducing MDA levels and increasing CAT activities.",Included

2861,"The Aftermath of Surviving Acute Radiation Hematopoietic Syndrome and its Mitigation. Intensive research is underway to find new agents that can successfully mitigate the acute effects of radiation exposure. This is primarily in response to potential counterthreats of radiological terrorism and nuclear accidents but there is some hope that they might also be of value for cancer patients treated with radiation therapy. Research into mitigation countermeasures typically employs classic animal models of acute radiation syndromes (ARS) that develop after whole-body irradiation (WBI). While agents are available that successfully mitigate ARS when given after radiation exposure, their success raises questions as to whether they simply delay lethality or unmask potentially lethal radiation pathologies that may appear later in time. Life shortening is a well-known consequence of WBI in humans and experimental animals, but it is not often examined in a mitigation setting and its causes, other than cancer, are not well-defined. This is in large part because delayed effects of acute radiation exposure (DEARE) do not follow the strict time-dose phenomena associated with ARS and present as a diverse range of symptoms and pathologies with low mortality rates that can be evaluated only with the use of large cohorts of subjects, as in this study. Here, we describe chronically increased mortality rates up to 660 days in large numbers of mice given LD70/30 doses of WBI. Systemic myeloid cell activation after WBI persists in some mice and is associated with late immunophenotypic changes and hematopoietic imbalance. Histopathological changes are largely of a chronic inflammatory nature and variable incidence, as are the clinical symptoms, including late diarrhea that correlates temporally with changes in the content of the microbiome. We also describe the acute and long-term consequences of mitigating hematopoietic ARS (H-ARS) lethality after LD70/30 doses of WBI in multiple cohorts of mice treated uniformly with radiation mitigators that have a common 4-nitro-phenylsulfonamide (NPS) pharmacophore. Effective NPS mitigators dramatically decrease ARS mortality. There is slightly increased subacute mortality, but the rate of late mortalities is slowed, allowing some mice to live a normal life span, which is not the case for WBI controls. The study has broad relevance to radiation late effects and their potential mitigation and epitomizes the complex interaction between radiation-damaged tissues and immune homeostasis.Copyright © 2019 by Radiation Research Society.

A high frequency of cells having chromosomal aberrations was shown to be preserved in the first generation of laboratory offspring of common voles, whose ancestors were captured near the East Ural radioactive track (EURT). In F2 and F3, a decrease in frequency was observed. Most likely, the cytogenetic effects observed were caused by environmental contamination with plutonium in the locality of capture. An increased chromosomal instability observed in the first laboratory generation of nonirradiated common voles was caused by reversible modifications in the expression of mutator genes inherited from parents exposed to alpha-irradiation rather than by classic mutations occurred in specific loci.",Included

2879,"Lung cancer mortality associated with protracted low-dose occupational radiation exposures and smoking behaviors in U.S. radiologic technologists, 1983-2012. In the Japanese atomic bomb survivors, risk of lung cancer has been shown to increase with greater acute exposure to ionizing radiation. Although similar findings have been observed in populations exposed to low-dose, protracted radiation, such studies lack information on cigarette smoking history, a potential confounder. In a cohort of 106 068 U.S. radiologic technologists, we examined the association between estimated cumulative lung absorbed dose from occupational radiation exposure and lung cancer mortality. Poisson regression models, adjusted for attained age, sex, birth cohort, pack-years smoked and years since quitting smoking, were used to calculate linear excess relative risks (ERR) per 100 mGy, using time-dependent cumulative lung absorbed dose, lagged 10 years. Mean cumulative absorbed dose to the lung was 25 mGy (range: 0-810 mGy). During the 1983 to 2012 follow-up, 1090 participants died from lung cancer. Greater occupational radiation lung dose was not associated with lung cancer mortality overall (ERR per 100 mGy: -0.02, 95% CI: <0-0.13). However, significant dose-response relationships were observed for some subgroups, which might be false-positive results given the number of statistical tests performed. As observed in other studies of radiation and smoking, the interaction between radiation and smoking appeared to be sub-multiplicative with an ERR per 100 mGy of 0.41 (95% CI: 0.01-1.15) for those who smoked <20 pack-years and -0.03 (95% CI: <0-0.15) for those who smoked >=20 pack-years. Our study provides some evidence that greater protracted radiation exposure in the low-dose range is positively associated with lung cancer mortality.Copyright © 2020 UICC",Included
2887,"Up-regulation of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma in radiation-induced heart injury in rats. To explore the expression level and the role of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPAR-gamma) in radiation-induced heart injury in a rat model, thirty-two Sprague-Dawley rats were divided into three groups (the control group, the 15-Gy irradiation group and the 18-Gy irradiation group). Experimental animals were exposed to radiation generated by a linear accelerator at the chest and killed after 3 months. Heart tissues from these animals were removed for Masson staining, PPAR-gamma immunohistochemical staining, Western blot analysis and real-time polymerase chain reaction assay (RT-PCR). In addition, the protein expression of matrix metalloprotein-1 (MMP-1), tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase-1 (TIMP-1) and transforming growth factor type beta1 (TGF-beta1), all of which are associated with fibrosis, was measured. Masson staining revealed significant myocardial fibrosis, degeneration and necrosis in rats exposed to radiation. The results of immunohistochemical staining and Western blot analysis showed that PPAR-gamma protein expression in hearts of the irradiation groups was significantly higher than in the control group, especially in myocardium and vascular endothelial (p < 0.05). RT-PCR results also showed a parallel increase in PPAR-gamma mRNA expression in the heart of the irradiation groups compared with the control group (p < 0.05). The expression of MMP-1 protein was not significantly different in three groups (p > 0.05). The expression of TIMP-1 and TGF-beta1 proteins was, however, higher in two irradiation groups than in the control group (p < 0.05). These data demonstrate that PPAR-gamma expression is up-regulated on both mRNA and protein levels in heart injured by radiation. PPAR-gamma may play an important role in radiation-induced heart injury.",Included
2894,"Differential effects of genotoxic stress on both concurrent body growth and gradual senescence in the adult zebrafish. Among vertebrates, fish and mammals show intriguing differences in their growth control properties with age. The potential for unlimited or indeterminate growth in a variety of fish species has prompted many questions regarding the senescent phenomena that appear during the aging process in these animals. Using zebrafish as our model system, we have attempted in our current study to examine the growth phenomena in fish in relation to the onset of senescence-associated symptoms, and to evaluate the effects of genotoxic stress on these processes. We observed in the course of these analyses that the zebrafish undergoes continuous growth, irrespective of age, past the point of sexual maturation with gradually decreasing growth rates at later stages. Animal population density, current body size and chronological age also play predominant roles in regulating zebrafish growth and all inversely influence the growth rate. Interestingly, the induction of genotoxic stress by exposure to ionizing radiation (IR) did not adversely affect this body growth ability in zebrafish. However, IR was found to chronically debilitate the regeneration of amputated caudal fins and thereby induce high levels of abnormal fin regeneration in the adult zebrafish. In addition, by resembling and mimicking the natural course of aging, IR treatments likewise enhanced several other symptoms of senescence, such as a decline in reproductive abilities, increased senescence-associated beta-galactosidase activity and a reduction in melatonin secretion. Our current data thus suggest that during the lifespan of zebrafish, the onset of senescence-associated symptoms occurs in parallel with continuous growth throughout mid-adulthood. Moreover, our present findings indicate that genotoxic DNA damage may play a role as a rate-limiting factor during the induction of senescence, but not in the inhibition of continuous, density-dependent growth in adult zebrafish.",Included
2896,"Nanosensor dosimetry of mouse blood proteins after exposure to ionizing radiation. Giant magnetoresistive (GMR) nanosensors provide a novel approach for measuring protein concentrations in blood for medical diagnosis.

Flt3lg concentrations showed excellent dose discrimination at >= 1 Gy in the time window of 1 to 7 days after exposure except 1 Gy at day 7. Saa1 dose response was limited to the first two days after exposure. A multiplex assay with both proteins showed improved dose classification accuracy. Our magneto-nanosensor assay demonstrates the dose and time responses, low-dose sensitivity, small volume requirements, and rapid speed that have important advantages in radiation triage biodosimetry.",Included
2902,"Texture analysis for the assessment of structural changes in parotid glands induced by radiotherapy. BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: During radiotherapy (RT) for head-and-neck cancer, parotid glands undergo significant anatomic, functional and structural changes which could characterize pre-clinical signs of an increased risk of xerostomia. Texture analysis is proposed to assess structural changes of parotids induced by RT, and to investigate whether early variations of textural parameters (such as mean intensity and fractal dimension) can predict parotid shrinkage at the end of treatment., MATERIAL AND METHODS: Textural parameters and volumes of 42 parotids from 21 patients treated with intensity-modulated RT for nasopharyngeal cancer were extracted from CT images. To individuate which parameters changed during RT, a Wilcoxon signed-rank test between textural indices (first and second RT week; first and last RT week) was performed. Discriminant analysis was applied to variations of these parameters in the first two weeks of RT to assess their power in predicting parotid shrinkage at the end of RT., RESULTS: A significant decrease in mean intensity (1.7 HU and 3.8 HU after the second and last weeks, respectively) and fractal dimension (0.016 and 0.021) was found. Discriminant analysis, based on volume and fractal dimension, was able to predict the final parotid shrinkage (accuracy of 71.4%)., CONCLUSION: Textural features could be used in combination with volume to characterize structural modifications on parotid glands and to predict parotid shrinkage at the end of RT.

2910,"Irradiation of adult human dental pulp stem cells provokes activation of p53, cell cycle arrest, and senescence but not apoptosis. Adult human dental pulp contains stem cells (DPSCs) that are capable of differentiation into osteoblasts, odontoblasts, adipocytes, and neuronal-like cells. Because these cells have potential use in tissue regeneration, herein we characterized the response of DPSC lines to ionizing radiation (IR). These DPSC lines have been developed from the extracted molars of healthy donors. DPSCs were cultivated in a unique media supplemented with epidermal growth factor (EGF) and platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF). Since tissue homeostasis depends on a precise balance among cell proliferation, senescence, and cell death, we explored the effects of IR (2-20 Gy) on the proliferative activity of DPSCs and the molecular pathways involved. Even the highest dose used (20 Gy) did not induce DPSC apoptosis. After irradiation with doses of 6 and 20 Gy, DPSCs accumulated in the G2 phase of the cell cycle. DPSCs responded to IR (20 Gy) with senescence detected as SA-beta-galactosidase positivity, beginning on the third day after irradiation. Twenty-four hours after irradiation, p53 and its serine 15 and 392 phosphorylated forms were detected. At this time, p21 (WAF1) was induced. Increases in protein p16 were observed from the third day following irradiation and continued till the end of the examination (Day 13). We conclude that DPSCs respond to IR-induced damage by permanent cell cycle arrest in the G2 phase and by stress-induced premature senescence. © 2010, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.",Included

Findings are that aortal atherosclerosis prevalence was higher in males and females underwent external gamma-irradiation of total dose over 0.5 Gy, in males and females underwent internal alpha-irradiation from incorporated plutonium of total absorbed radiation dose in liver over 0.025 Gy.

3007,"Personalized space radiation dosimetry using monte carlo simulations of CT-based geometries exposed to solar particle event radiation. Purpose/Objective(s): A serious concern for space exploration to the Moon or Mars is astronaut exposure to ionizing radiation in a solar particle event (SPE). SPE are unpredictable, variable in intensity and energy spectrum, and are primarily protons with kinetic energies below 100 MeV. The dose from an SPE is highly inhomogeneous and sensitive to physical parameters such as energy spectrum, shielding, and anisotropy. The biological effects of low dose-rate proton radiation are not fully understood. Interpretation of data from ground-based experiments in animal models is complicated by inhomogeneous distribution of dose to sensitive organs. Planning and preparation for space exploration vitally relies on accurate prediction of the health risk associated with exposure to SPE. Materials/Methods: We have developed a Monte Carlo radiation transport tool that incorporates CT scans into dose calculations of radiobiological experiments in animal models and simulated exposure of humans to SPE radiation. This allows accurate predictions of SPE dose and is used to develop dose-toxicity data for pre-clinical animal experiments and for predicting astronaut organ doses from exposure to SPE radiation. Result(s): We validated this tool using phantom measurements and determine organ doses for Yucatan mini-pigs exposed to simulated SPE radiation designed to match 3 historical events with relatively low (October, 1989), intermediate (September, 1989) and high (August, 1972) levels of >100 MeV protons to model toxicity vs dose in critical internal organs. These studies show a paradoxical increase in clinical/systemic toxicity for SPE with lower internal dose that appears to correlate with suppression of leukocyte counts. For astronaut SPE exposures, we applied this tool to 4 different human model (2 male, 2 female) astronauts exposed to the 3 SPE in geometries designed to simulate exposure within a space suit or capsule. The results indicate that not only does an astronaut's dose to specific organs (e.g., skin, eyes, and lungs) differ substantially for different SPE, different astronauts receive significantly different organ doses even with the same SPE exposure. Conclusion(s): These studies clearly show the value of our dosimetry system for two critically interrelated uses: determining the dose to organ systems for SPE exposed astronauts and helping ensure that earth based experiments reproduce appropriate dose distributions in order to maximize the applicability of these findings. Our results suggest that a personalized approach for astronaut dosimetry may be valuable in determining the course of clinical action in the event of an SPE exposure.",Included

OBJECTIVES: The purpose of the present study is to evaluate the effect of intravascular radiation (IR) on the arterial wall of uninjured vessels in the hypercholesteremic rabbit model., METHODS: Aortas of 24 New Zealand white rabbits were treated with either intravascular 192-Ir gamma-radiation (15 Gy at 2 mm from the center of the source) or were exposed to the source catheter without radiation (sham controls). Following the radiation treatment, the animals were fed a 2% cholesterol diet until euthanasia at 2 (n=8) or 6 (n=16) weeks. Arteries were analyzed using light and scanning electron microscopy (SEM); transforming growth factor beta (TGF-beta) 1, a promoter of connective tissue deposition, was also monitored., RESULTS: At 2 weeks, SEM analysis showed well-aligned endothelial cells in nonradiated segments, whereas irradiated arteries consistently contained adherent and subendothelial macrophages with focal areas of endothelial disruption. Further radiated segments at 2 weeks showed a 7-fold increase in active TGF beta-1 over nonradiated segments. At 6 weeks, there was a significant increase in plaque and vessel wall area relative to control arteries, however, no differences were noted in the density of actin-positive smooth muscle cells (SMCs) or macrophages. Similarly, no differences were noted in cell proliferation between groups as evidenced by the marker bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU). In contrast, nonirradiated segments frequently contained cellular areas with extracellular lipid., CONCLUSION: Exposure of previously uninjured vessels to IR and hypercholesterolemia is associated with increased plaque burden and leads to more advanced plaque types. Special care should be taken to minimize radiation exposure in normal vascular segments in hypercholesterolemic patients undergoing radiation therapy.",Included

Traditionally, the dicentric chromosome assay (DCA) has been used to derive biological dose estimates for unknown radiological exposures. While sensitive, this assay requires highly trained evaluators and is extremely time consuming. The cytokinesis-block micronucleus (CBMN) assay has been suggested as an alternative to the DCA, as it is much faster to evaluate samples and requires less technical expertise. In order to validate this assay for triage biodosimetry, dose-response curves were generated for six donors at eight doses of gamma-radiation (0-4.0 Gy). Each sample was evaluated by 12 individuals, among three different laboratories and the incidence of micronuclei was determined after counting 50-500 binucleated cells. This study demonstrated that the CBMN assay was capable of detecting radiation doses >or=1 Gy after scoring only 200 binucleated cells. As such, the CBMN assay may provide a sensitive and reliable technique for deployment as an initial screening tool in a large-scale radiological emergency where large numbers of biological dose estimates are required.",Included
3112,"Selective brain responses to acute and chronic low-dose X-ray irradiation in males and females. Radiation exposure is known to have profound effects on the brain, leading to precursor cell dysfunction and debilitating cognitive declines [Nat. Med. 8 (2002) 955]. Although a plethora of data exist on the effects of high radiation doses, the effects of low-dose irradiation, such as ones received during repetitive diagnostic and therapeutic exposures, are still under-investigated [Am. J. Otolaryngol. 23 (2002) 215; Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 97 (2000) 889; Curr. Opin. Neurol. 16 (2003) 129]. Furthermore, most studies of the biological effects of ionizing radiation have been performed using a single acute dose, while clinically and environmentally relevant exposures occur predominantly under chronic/repetitive conditions. Here, we have used a mouse model to compare the effects of chronic/repetitive and acute low-dose radiation (LDR) exposure (0.5Gy) to ionizing radiation on the brain in vivo. We examined the LDR effects on p42/44 MAPK (ERK1/ERK2), CaMKII, and AKT signaling-the interconnected pathways that have been previously shown to be crucial for neuronal survival upon irradiation. We report perturbations in ERK1/2, AKT, and CREB upon acute and chronic/repetitive low-dose exposure in the hippocampus and frontal cortex of mice. These studies were paralleled by the analysis of radiation effects on neurogenesis and cellular proliferation. Repetitive exposure had a much more pronounced effect on cellular signaling and neurogenesis than acute exposure. These results suggest that studies of single acute exposures might be limited in terms of their predictive value. We also present the first evidence of sex differences in radiation-induced signaling in the hippocampus and frontal cortex. We show the role of estrogens in brain radiation responses and discuss the implications of the observed changes.",Included
3126,"Enumeration of circulating microparticles in healthy medical workers occupationally exposed to low doses of ionizing radiation. Background: Strong evidence suggests microparticles (MP) as a biomarker of vascular injury. It may also contribute to the initiation and the development of atherosclerosis. In fact, several biological mechanisms might be responsible of atherosclerosis caused by radiation exposure even at a low dose. Therefore, the measurement of MP might be of a great potential for providing new insight into low-dose radiation cardiovascular risk. Aim(s): We investigated the effect of long-term medical occupational exposure to low doses of ionizing radiation (LDIR) on MP populations levels. Method(s): The current study was conducted in accordance with the Helsinki Declaration on 38 healthy medical workers occupationally exposed to LDIR and 29 matched controls by gender, age, and smoking habits. The measured MP by flow cytometry were classified as positive or negative phosphatidylserine (PS+ or PS-), and phenotyped according to their cellular origin. Result(s): Total MP (PS-/PS+), regardless of phenotype, were significantly higher in workers occupationally exposed to LDIR than controls (p=0.0004). In medical exposed workers, PS- MP predominated (68%) and were approximately three times more common than PS+ MP. Concerning the measurement of MP according to their cellular origin, we found that MP derived from platelets (CD41a+ PMP), endothelial (CD146+ EMP), leucocytes (CD45+ LMP) and erythrocytes (CD235a+ RMP) are more abundant in exposed workers than those in controls (p< 0.0001). However, no significant difference was found in the proportion of the other blood elements in the peripheral circulation between the two groups. In addition, no association was observed between MP levels and the studied confounding factors. Conclusion(s): Our results suggest that elevated circulating MP populations levels represent an indicator of cellular damage caused by medical exposure to LDIR. By consequence, the quantification of MP seems to a useful biomarker for assessing the negative effects of occupational exposure to ionizing radiation. (Figure Presented) .",Included
3127,"Deficiency in PER proteins has no effect on the rate of spontaneous and radiation-induced carcinogenesis. There is a growing body of evidence that components of the circadian clock are involved in modulation of numerous signaling pathways, and that clock deregulation due to environmental or genetic factors contributes to the development of various pathologies, including cancer. Previous work performed in tissue culture and in in vivo mouse models defined mammalian PERIOD proteins as tumor suppressors, although some experimental inconsistencies (the use of mice on mixed genetic background, lack of sexual discrimination) did not allow a definitive conclusion. To address this issue in a systematic way, we performed a detailed analysis comparing the incidence of tumor development after low-dose ionizing radiation in male and female wild-type, Per1-/-, and Per2-/- mice. We showed that in contrast to previous reports deficiency in either Per1 or Per2 genes by itself does not make mice more tumor-prone; moreover, some of the long-term effects of ionizing radiation in Per2-deficient mice are reminiscent more of accelerated aging rather than tumor-prone phenotype. Our histopathological analysis also revealed significant sexual dimorphism both in the rate of radiation-induced tumorigenesis and in the spectrum of tumors developed, which underscores the importance of using sex-matched experimental groups for in vivo studies. Based on our results, we suggest that the role of PER proteins as bone fide tumor suppressors needs to be reevaluated. © 2013 Landes Bioscience.",Included

Correlation of uranium excreted in urine with bio-indicators at p <=.05 indicated interference with the kidney's reabsorptive function. Because of the community's concerns regarding cancer incidence, the authors also calculated cumulative radiation doses using uranium intake in drinking water over the preceding 15-year period. The highest total uranium intake over this period was 1,761 mg.

Background: Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cells are characterized by non-mutated TP53, high levels of Hdm2, and frequent mutation of the Flt3 receptor tyrosine kinase. The juxtamembrane mutation of FLT3 is the strongest independent marker for disease relapse and is associated with elevated Bcl-2 protein and p53 hyper-phosphorylation in AML. DNA damage forms the basic mechanism of cancer cell eradication in current therapy of AML. Hdm2 and pro-apoptotic Bcl-2 members are among the most intensely induced genes immediately after chemotherapy and Hdm2 is proposed a role in receptor tyrosine kinase regulation. Thus we examined the DNA damage related modulation of these proteins in relation to FLT3 mutational status and induction of apoptosis. Result(s): Within one hour after exposure to ionizing radiation (IR), the AML cells (NB4, MV4-11, HL-60, primary AML cells) showed an increase in Flt3 protein independent of mRNA levels, while the Hdm2 protein decreased. The FLT3 mutant MV4-11 cells were resistant to IR accompanied by presence of both Mcl-1 and Hdm2 protein three hours after IR. In contrast, the FLT3 wild type NB4 cells responded to IR with apoptosis and pre-apoptotic Mcl-1 down regulation. Daunorubicin (DNR) induced continuing down regulation of Hdm2 and Mcl-1 in both cell lines followed by apoptosis. Conclusion(s): Both IR and DNR treatment resulted in concerted protein modulations of Mcl-1, Hdm2 and Flt3. Cell death induction was associated with persistent attenuation of Mcl-1 and Hdm2. These observations suggest that defining the pathway(s) modulating Flt3, Hdm2 and Mcl-1 may propose new strategies to optimize therapy for the relapse prone FLT3 mutated AML patients. © 2007 Wergeland et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",Included
3190,"Radiation-induced malignancies after intensity-modulated versus conventional mediastinal radiotherapy in a small animal model. A long-standing hypothesis in radiotherapy is that intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) increases the risk of second cancer due to low-dose exposure of large volumes of normal tissue. Therefore, young patients are still treated with conventional techniques rather than with modern IMRT. We challenged this hypothesis in first-of-its-kind experiments using an animal model. Cancer-prone Tp53+/C273X knockout rats received mediastinal irradiation with 3x5 or 3x8Gy using volumetric-modulated arc therapy (VMAT, an advanced IMRT) or conventional anterior-posterior/posterior-anterior (AP/PA) beams using non-irradiated rats as controls (n=15/group, ntotal=90). Tumors were assigned to volumes receiving 90-107%, 50-90%, 5-50%, and <5% of the target dose and characterized by histology and loss-of-heterozygosity (LOH). Irradiated rats predominantly developed lymphomas and sarcomas in areas receiving 50-107% (n=26) rather than 5-50% (n=7) of the target dose. Latency was significantly shortened only after 3x8Gy vs. controls (p<0.0001). The frequency (14/28 vs. 19/29; p=0.29) and latency (218 vs. 189 days; p=0.17) of radiation-associated tumors were similar after VMAT vs. AP/PA.

The use of the chacma baboon (Papio ursinus) in radiobiological investigations justifies special attention because it answers many of the criteria of parallelism to the human. The present study was undertaken to establish whether in vitro gamma-radiation effects in chacma baboon and human lymphocytes are comparable. The sensitive and rapid nucleoid sedimentation technique was employed to evaluate in vitro DNA superstructure, damage and repair in readily obtainable radiosensitive peripheral lymphocytes. Dose-response curves after 60Co gamma-irradiation were obtained, and by applying single-hit kinetics of the target theory, an estimation of molecular masses of the supercoiled domains was made. The baboon and human lymphocytes produced analogous results, while an ethidium bromide intercalation study also revealed a similarity in average DNA superhelical density. Lymphocyte DNA repair after 0.5-4.0 Gy gamma-irradiation and repair times from 0.5 to 5.0 h were evaluated. The repair data obtained from baboon and human cells after 2.0 Gy irradiation compared favourably in extent of DNA repair as well as the profiles of the kinetic curves. These findings indicate that the chacma baboon would be a useful and relevant model for further in vivo radiobiological studies on lymphocytes. The effects of sedimentation conditions and advantages of using vertical-tube rotors in the nucleoid sedimentation technique are also discussed.",Included
3199,"MiR-19 in blood plasma reflects lung cancer occurrence but is not specifically associated with radon exposure. Radon is one of the most powerful carcinogens, particularly in terms of lung cancer onset and development. miRNAs may be considered not only as markers of the ongoing tumorigenesis but also as a hallmark of exposure to radiation, including radon and its progeny. Therefore, the purpose of the present study was to estimate the value of plasma miR-19b-3p level as the prospective marker of the response to radon exposure in lung cancer pathogenesis. A total of 136 subjects were examined, including 49 radon-exposed patients with lung cancer, 37 patients with lung cancer without radon exposure and 50 age/sex matched healthy controls. Total RNA from blood samples was extracted and used to detect miR-19b-3p expression via reverse transcription quantitative-polymerase chain reaction. The 2-DELTADELTACq method was used to quantify the amount of relative miRNA. The plasma level of p53 protein was determined using a Human p53 ELISA kit. Plasma miR-19b-3p level was significantly higher in the patients with lung cancer groups, compared with the healthy control group (P<0.0001). No other statistically significant differences were determined in the expression level of plasma miR-19b-3p between patients diagnosed with lung cancer exposed to radon and not exposed to radon. The expression level of free circulating miR-19b-3p was higher in the group of non-smoking patients with lung cancer, compared with smokers with lung cancer. The miR-19b-3p was 1.4-fold higher in non-smokers than in smokers (P<0.05). No association between plasma levels of p53 protein and miR-19b-3p freely circulating in patients with lung cancer was observed. No other statistically significant differences were determined in the plasma p53 protein level between patients diagnosed with lung cancer exposed and not exposed to radon. These results indicated that detection of miR-19b-3p levels in plasma potentially could be exploited as a noninvasive method for the lung cancer diagnostics. However, this miRNA is not suitable as the precise marker for radon impact.Copyright © 2018, Spandidos Publications. All rights reserved.",Included
3211,"Limiting values for the RBE of fission neutrons at low doses for life shortening in mice. We have analyzed recently published data on the effects of low doses of fission neutrons on the mean survival times of mice. The analysis for single-dose exposures was confined to doses of 20 rad or less, while for fractionated exposures only total doses of 80 rad or less were considered. We fitted the data to the frequently used power function model: life shortening = beta D lambda, where D is the radiation dose. We show that, at low doses per fraction, either (1) the effects are not additive or (2) the dose-effect curve for single exposures cannot show a greater negative curvature than about the 0.9 power of dose. Analysis of the data for gamma rays showed that an exponent of 1.0 gave an acceptable fit. Taken together, these findings indicate that the RBE for neutrons cannot change more rapidly with neutron dose than about RBEN approximately = k/D0.1N. This conflicts with the more widely accepted relationship, RBEN approximately = k/D0.5N. Because of the inherent implausibility of exponents less than 1.0 for the neutron dose-effect curves at low doses we conclude that at neutron doses of 20 rad or less the RBE for life shortening is constant and ranges from 13 to 22 depending on mouse strain and sex.",Included

We have assessed chromosome-type aberrations and micronuclei in the peripheral lymphocytes of personnel working with C-arm fluoroscopy, multi-slice CT-scan, lithotripsy, and digital radiology medical procedures. The study population comprised of 46 exposed workers and 35 controls matched for age, gender, and other confounding factors. Chromosome-type aberrations and micronuclei were analyzed and compared with occupational dosimetry data. The highest frequency of both chromosome aberrations (1.62 CA/100 cells) and MN (MN = 7.47 +/- 2.55) was observed in the operating room group. According to occupational dosimetry, surgeons and medical staff received 0-2.99 mSv over the previous year, well below the limit established by the International Committee on Radiation Protection. An increased level of chromosomal aberrations was observed among workers exposed in the operating rooms. We recommend that operating room radiation safety programs be improved and better supervised, in particular for orthopedic surgeons and personnel performing fluoroscopically guided procedures.

3247,"Association between trunk and leg fat and incidence of diabetes. Background: General obesity defined by body mass index (BMI) is a major risk factor of diabetes mellitus (DM). Although body fat distribution is also considered to be a predictor of DM, only a few longitudinal studies have examined the association between DM risk and body composition, estimated directly using such methods as DEXA, in particular with reference to Asian populations who have a higher prevalence of DM at lower BMI levels compared with CaucAsians. Objective(s): To determine whether fat distribution is associated with DM incidence, independently of BMI, in an elderly Japanese population. Method(s): We analyzed 1,550 subjects without DM (472 men and 1,078 women, average age of 65.3 years) in the Adult Health Study, consisting of atomic bomb survivors and their controls, whose body composition was measured using DEXA during the period 1994-96. Fat-mass percentages for the trunk and legs were calculated by dividing each of the specific body partTMs fat mass by total soft tissue mass. DM was defined as glucose 126mg/dl fasting or 200mg/dl nonfasting, or physician-diagnosed DM, or the use of medication for DM. We followed-up through the end of 2011. Result(s): During a mean follow-up period of 11.4 years, 85 men and 110 women developed DM. Almost 20% of men and 28% of women were overweight/obese (BMI25kg/m2) at baseline. After multivariate analysis with adjustment made for age, metabolic syndrome risk factors other than central obesity, radiation dose, and smoking and alcohol consumption status, only overweight/obese women had a significant association with DM incidence compared with non-obese women (relative risk [RR] 1.52; 95% CI 1.01-2.27). Percentages of trunk fat and leg fat were associated with incidence of DM, independently of each other, after adjustment for age, BMI, and other risk factors. Increased percentage of trunk fat was a significant risk factor for incidence of DM; the RR for 1% increase in trunk fat were 1.13 (95% CI 1.06-1.20) in men and 1.08 (95% CI 1.02-1.14) in women, whereas, leg fat had protective effects regarding incidence of DM (men RR 0.83; 95% CI 0.71-0.96, women RR 0.87; 95% CI 0.79-0.95, for 1% increase in leg fat). These significant associations were observed for non-obese subjects. Conclusion(s): Trunk and leg fat were associated with incidence of DM, independently of each other. In addition to evaluation of general and abdominal obesity, the assessment of body fat distribution might also be useful in the prevention of DM.",Included

Objectives: Xerostomia is a common post-radiotherapy (post-RT) complication in nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) patients. This study evaluated the relation of post-RT parotid gland changes with the dose received. Method(s): Data from 18 NPC patients treated by radiotherapy between 1997 and 2001 were collected. Parotid gland volumes were measured and compared between their pre-RT and post-RT CT images; both sets of CT were conducted with the same scanning protocol. Doppler ultrasound was used to assess the haemodynamic condition of the glands after radiotherapy. Doppler ultrasound results were compared against 18 agematched normal participants. A questionnaire was used to evaluate the patients'comments of xerostomia condition. Radiotherapy treatment plans of the participants were retrieved from the Eclipse treatment planning system from which the radiation doses delivered to the parotid glands were estimated. The correlations of parotid gland doses and the post-RT changes were evaluated. Result(s): The post-RT parotid glands were significantly smaller (p<0.001) than the pre-RT ones. They also demonstrated lower vascular velocity, resistive and pulsatility indices (p<0.05) than normal participants. The degree of volume shrinkage and subjective severity of xerostomia demonstrated dose dependence, but such dependence was not definite in the haemodynamic changes. Conclusion(s): It was possible to predict the gland volume change and subjective severity of xerostomia based on the dose to the parotid glands for NPC patients. However, such prediction was not effective for the vascular changes. The damage to the gland was long lasting and had significant effects on the patients' quality of life. © 2011 The British Institute of Radiology.",Included

In 44 persons (25 women and 15 men), workers handling X-ray equipment in X-ray laboratories the ability was studied of nitroblue tetrazolium (NBT) reduction by neutrophils. The obtained results were compared with a control group. Besides that subgroups were isolated taking into account the sex of the studied subjects and duration of their work with X-ray equipment (over five years and below five years). In the workers handling X-ray equipment and in the isolated subgroups of women and men, the index of spontaneous NBT reduction turned out to be statistically significantly higher than that in the control group. In the group of studied workers the index of latex-stimulated NBT reduction was statistically significantly lower than that in the control group. Taking into account the duration of work with X-ray equipment in the subgroups of women and men working for over five years, the lowest index of phagocytes was noted. On the basis of the obtained results the following conclusions were formulated: 1. In workers handling X-ray equipment disturbances occur of peripheral blood neutrophil metabolism assessed in the NBT test. 2. Neutrophil phagocytic activity is weakened in persons working over five years with X-ray equipment.",Included
3276,"Noninvasive evaluation of radiation-enhanced glioma cells invasiveness by ultra-high-field (1)H-MRS in vitro. INTRODUCTION: Glioma is the most common type of the primary CNS tumor. Radiotherapy is an important treatment measure after surgery. However, its highly invasive character is the main reason of postoperative recurrence. The aim of the study was to probe the correlation between the invasion ability and the metabolite characteristics of glioma cells at the cellular level after irradiation by using 14.7T high-resolution nuclear proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy ((1)H-MRS)., METHODS: To determine the matrix metalloproteinase-2 (MMP-2) activity and metabolite ratios of glioma cells after irradiation with different doses of X-rays, U87 and C6 glioma cells were exposed to X-ray irradiation of 0, 1, 5, 10, and 15Gy. After 20h, the perchloric acid (PCA) extraction method was used to evaluate water-soluble metabolites [choline (Cho), creatine (Cr), and N-acetylaspartate (NAA)], and (1)H-MRS patterns and changes in metabolite ratios were observed in vitro by 14.7T high resolution (1)H-MRS. Matrigel invasion assays and gelatin zymography were performed to test the invasion ability of U87 and C6 glioma cells., RESULTS: Good MR spectra were obtained from PCA method extracts of U87 and C6 glioma cells. Both radiation-induced MMP-2 activity and the Cho/Cr and Cho/NAA ratios increased after irradiation, and their increase occurred in a dose-dependent manner. The MMP-2 activity and the Cho/Cr and Cho/NAA ratios of glioma cells increased after irradiation up to 10Gy and decreased thereafter. In particular, the Cho/NAA ratio of U87 cells increased from 3.55+/-0.06 (0Gy) to 9.13+/-0.30 (10Gy) and then declined to 5.94+/-0.15 (15Gy). Furthermore, the invasion ability of glioma cells had a strong positive correlation with the Cho/Cr and Cho/NAA ratios. Both the Cho/Cr ratio and the Cho/NAA ratio of U87 glioma cells were highly positively correlated with the number of invading cells in the Matrigel invasion assay. The Pearson's correlation coefficient (r) values of U87 cells were 0.89 (Cho/Cr ratio versus invasion ability) and 0.91 (Cho/NAA ratio versus invasion ability) (P<0.01). C6 cells exhibited similar changes to those of U87 cells., CONCLUSIONS: In vitro high-resolution (1)H-MRS is useful for detecting glioma invasiveness at the cellular level. Copyright © 2016.

3284,"Age at exposure to ionising radiation and cancer mortality among Hanford workers: Follow up through 1994. Background: Studies of workers at the plutonium production factory in Hanford, WA have led to conflicting conclusions about the role of age at exposure as a modifier of associations between ionising radiation and cancer. Aim(s): To evaluate the influence of age at exposure on radiation risk estimates in an updated follow up of Hanford workers. Method(s): A cohort of 26 389 workers hired between 1944 and 1978 was followed through 1994 to ascertain vital status and causes of death. External radiation dose estimates were derived from personal dosimeters. Poisson regression was used to estimate associations between mortality and cumulative external radiation dose at all ages, and in specific age ranges. Result(s): A total of 8153 deaths were identified, 2265 of which included cancer as an underlying or contributory cause. Estimates of the excess relative risk per Sievert (ERR/Sv) for cumulative radiation doses at all ages combined were negative for all cause and leukaemia and positive for all cancer and lung cancer. Cumulative doses accrued at ages below 35, 35-44, and 45-54 showed little association with mortality. For cumulative dose accrued at ages 55 and above (10 year lag), the estimated ERR/Sv for all cancers was 3.24 (90% CI: 0.80 to 6.17), primarily due to an association with lung cancer (ERR/Sv. 9.05, 90% CI: 2.96 to 17.92). Conclusion(s): Associations between radiation and cancer mortality in this cohort are primarily a function of doses at older ages and deaths from lung cancer. The association of older age radiation exposures and cancer mortality is similar to observations from several other occupational studies.",Included

3311,"Modifying Effect of Chronic Atrophic Gastritis on Radiation Risk for Noncardia Gastric Cancer According to Histological Type. The findings from previously published studies have suggested that radiation exposure is associated with increased mortality and incidence of gastric cancer. However, few cohort studies have incorporated risk factors such as Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) infection or chronic atrophic gastritis (CAG). The current study is aimed at evaluating the modifying effect of CAG on radiation risk of noncardia gastric cancer by histological type, by reanalyzing data from a nested case-control study conducted within the longitudinal clinical cohort of atomic bomb survivors. The analysis was restricted to 297 intestinal- or diffuse-type noncardia cases and 873 controls rematched to the cases on gender, age, city, and time and type of serum storage, and countermatched on radiation dose. Multivariable-adjusted relative risks [95% confidence interval (CI)] of noncardia gastric cancer were 3.9 (2.1-7.2) for H. pylori IgG seropositivity with cytotoxin-associated gene A (CagA) IgG low titer, 2.6 (1.9-3.6) for CAG, 1.9 (1.3-2.8) for current smoking, and 1.4 (1.1-1.9) for 1 Gy irradiation. Among subjects without CAG, the relative risk (95% CI) of noncardia gastric cancer at 1 Gy was 2.3 (1.4-3.7), whereas relative risk (95% CI) at 1 Gy was 1.1 (0.8-1.5) among subjects with CAG (for the overall interaction, P = 0.012). By histological type, the risk at 1 Gy was high for diffuse type without CAG, with adjusted relative risk (95% CI) of 3.8 (2.0-7.6), but was not high for diffuse type with CAG or for intestinal-type irrespective of CAG status. The results indicate that radiation exposure is associated with increased risk of diffuse-type noncardia gastric cancer without CAG, and this association exists despite adjustment for H. pylori infection and smoking habit.

After radiotherapy treatment, there is an increased incidence of localized atherosclerosis in patients with Hodgkin's disease, breast cancer, and head and neck cancer. Here, we established a mouse model to study the development and progression of radiation-induced atherosclerosis and to compare the phenotype of these lesions with age-related atherosclerosis. Atherosclerosis-prone ApoE-/- mice fed a regular chow diet received single radiation doses of 14 Gy or sham treatments (0 Gy) to the neck, including both carotid arteries. At 22, 28, and 34 weeks after irradiation, blood samples were taken, and the arterial tree was removed for histological examination. Cholesterol levels in irradiated mice were not significantly different from age-matched controls, and markers of systemic inflammation (soluble intercellular adhesion molecule-1, soluble vascular cell adhesion molecule-1, and C-reactive protein) were not elevated. The lesions in irradiated arteries were macrophage rich, with a remarkable influx of inflammatory cells, predominantly granulocytes. Intraplaque hemorrhage and erythrocyte-containing macrophages were seen only in lesions of irradiated arteries. Based on these data, we propose that irradiation accelerates the development of macrophage-rich, inflammatory atherosclerotic lesions prone to intraplaque hemorrhage.",Included
3343,"Decline of natural killer cell activity in sublethally irradiated mice. Spleen cells of (C57BL/6 X C3H/He)F1 mice were assayed for natural killer (NK) cell activity against YAC-1 and FBL-3 lymphoma targets at several intervals after total-body exposure to a high sublethal dose of 137Cs or 60Co gamma-rays. NK cell activity did not decline for the first 12 days but decreased sharply thereafter and remained low until day 24. The recovery of splenic NK cell activity was delayed. Beginning on day 28, the activity was slowly increased, reaching near-normal levels (80% of controls) 41-59 days after irradiation. Suppressor cells detectable during the period of lowest NK cell activity, i.e., on days 17 and 19, may have been responsible for the delayed and slow recovery. These studies indicated that a) mature effectors of natural cytotoxicity are relatively radioresistant renewable cells with a lifespan of about 2 weeks whose progenitors are radiosensitive cells b) the kinetics of decline and especially of recovery of NK cell activity may be influenced by suppressor cells. Should NK cell activity confer resistance to autochthonous lymphomas in vivo, it may be a significant consideration for strategies of tumor therapy by cytotoxic agents that reconstitution of the NK cell pool is a slow process and that suppressor cell function must be overcome for full recovery.",Included
3351,"Sex-Specific Effects of a Wartime-Like Radiation Exposure on Cognitive Function. Evaluating the risk for central nervous system (CNS) effects after whole-body or partial-body irradiation presents challenges due in part to the varied exposure scenarios in the context of occupational, accidental or wartime releases. Risk estimations are further complicated by the fact that robust changes in brain function are unlikely to manifest until significantly late post exposure times. Collectively, the current data regarding CNS radiation risk are conflicting in humans and a survey of the animal model data shows that it is similarly inconsistent. Due to the sparseness of such data, the current study was conducted using male and female mice to evaluate the brain for the delayed effects of a 2 Gy whole-body exposure to c rays starting six months postirradiation. Behavioral testing indicated sex-specific differences in the induction of anxiety-like behaviors and in the ability to abolish fear memories. Molecular analyses showed alterations in post-synaptic protein levels that might affect synaptic plasticity and increased levels of global DNA methylation, suggesting a potential epigenetic mechanism that might contribute to radiation-induced cognitive dysfunction. These data add to the understanding of the CNS response to whole-body irradiation and may lead to improved risk assessment and provide guidance in the development of effective radiation countermeasures to protect military personnel and civilians alike.",Included
3355,"Apollo Lunar Astronauts Show Higher Cardiovascular Disease Mortality: Possible Deep Space Radiation Effects on the Vascular Endothelium. As multiple spacefaring nations contemplate extended manned missions to Mars and the Moon, health risks could be elevated as travel goes beyond the Earth's protective magnetosphere into the more intense deep space radiation environment. The primary purpose of this study was to determine whether mortality rates due to cardiovascular disease (CVD), cancer, accidents and all other causes of death differ in (1) astronauts who never flew orbital missions in space, (2) astronauts who flew only in low Earth orbit (LEO), and (3) Apollo lunar astronauts, the only humans to have traveled beyond Earth's magnetosphere. Results show there were no differences in CVD mortality rate between non-flight (9%) and LEO (11%) astronauts. However, the CVD mortality rate among Apollo lunar astronauts (43%) was 4-5 times higher than in non-flight and LEO astronauts. To test a possible mechanistic basis for these findings, a secondary purpose was to determine the long-term effects of simulated weightlessness and space-relevant total-body irradiation on vascular responsiveness in mice. The results demonstrate that space-relevant irradiation induces a sustained vascular endothelial cell dysfunction. Such impairment is known to lead to occlusive artery disease, and may be an important risk factor for CVD among astronauts exposed to deep space radiation.",Included

UNLABELLED: This study evaluates the use of the 99mTc-DTPA aerosol lung clearance method to investigate radiation-induced lung changes in eight patients undergoing radiotherapy for lung or breast carcinoma. The sensitivity of the method was compared with chest radiography for detecting radiation-induced changes in the lung, regional alterations within (irradiated region) and outside (shielded region) the treatment ports, effect of irradiated lung volume, and dependence on time after radiotherapy., METHODS: Serial DTPA lung clearance studies were performed before the first radiation treatment (baseline), then weekly during a 5- to 7-wk course, and up to 12 times post-therapy over periods of 56-574 days. The total activity deposited in the lungs for each study was approximately 150 microCi (approximately 5.6 MBq). DTPA clearance, expressed in terms of the biological half-time, t 1/2, was computed from the slopes of the least-squares fit regression lines of the time-activity curves for the first 10 min for irradiated and shielded lung regions., RESULTS: Major findings include: (a) significant and early DTPA t 1/2 changes were observed in all patients during and after radiotherapy; (b) changes in DTPA t 1/2 values were observed in both irradiated and shielded lung regions in all patients suggesting a radiation-induced systemic reaction; (c) changes in DTPA t 1/2 values were correlated (p < 0.05) with the irradiated lung volumes; (d) significantly reduced DTPA t 1/2 values were observed in three patients who subsequently presented with clinical symptoms and/or radiographic changes consistent with radiation pneumonitis (t1/2 felt to 19% +/- 6% of baseline values, compared with 64% +/- 17% in the remaining patients [p < 0.01]); (e) the onset of decreased DTPA t 1/2 values in these three patients occurred 35-84 days before clinical symptoms and/or radiographic changes; and (f) DTPA t 1/2 tended to approach baseline values with time after radiotherapy, suggesting a long-term recovery in lung injury., CONCLUSION: These observations show significant and early alterations in DTPA lung clearance during and after radiotherapy that may provide a sensitive assay to monitor changes in radiation-induced lung injury and may facilitate early therapeutic intervention.",Included

Clinical irradiation of the brain induces hippocampus-dependent cognitive impairments in some but not all individuals, suggesting the involvement of genetic risk factors. Deficiency of apolipoprotein E (APOE), which is important for the metabolism and redistribution of lipoproteins and cholesterol, increases behavioral impairments after irradiation, supporting a protective role for APOE against radiation-induced cognitive injury. Compared to APOE3, APOE4 increases while APOE2 decreases the risk of developing age-related cognitive decline and Alzheimer's disease, particularly in women. To determine the potential effects of APOE isoform and sex on radiation-induced cognitive impairments, we irradiated 2-month-old male and female APOE2, APOE3 and APOE4 mice and assessed their cognitive performance 3 months later. When hippocampus-dependent spatial learning and memory were assessed in the water maze, sham-irradiated female APOE2, APOE3 and APOE4 and irradiated female APOE2 mice showed spatial memory retention, but irradiated female APOE3 and APOE4 mice did not. Compared to sham-irradiated female APOE4 mice, irradiated female APOE4 mice also required more trials to reach criterion in the hippocampus-dependent passive avoidance test.

Histological changes, such as reactive gliosis, inflammation, vascular proliferation and necrosis, were correlated with the duration after irradiation. Significant VEGF and FGF2 expression in the 2- and 8-week were detected by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay quantification in the radiation group. Immunohistochemical study for VEGF was done and the number of positive cells gradually increased over time, compared with the sham operation group. In conclusion, the radiation injuries consisted of radiation necrosis associated with the expression of VEGF and FGF2.

The relationship between basal cell survival and gross response in irradiated swine skin was tested by comparing dose survival curves derived from time-dose isoeffect data with curves obtained directly from basal cell counts in histological sections. Assuming equal effect per exposure and constant cell survival at isoeffect, best-fitting single-hit multi-target and linear-quadratic response curves were determined for time-dose schedules resulting in non-healing of 50% of irradiated fields. Basal cell survivals for single doses of 970, 1649, 2231, and 2619 rad were estimated 1) by counting regenerating islands and 2) by monitoring total basal cell counts through time. The dose survival curve derived from the isoeffect data was steeper than the curve obtained from direct basal cell counts. Furthermore, the direct basal cell survival curve extrapolates to less than 100% at zero dose, indicating the presence of a resistant basal cell subpopulation. The data show that the isoeffect in this case is not strongly coupled to basal cell survival. Rather, the probability of healing of an irradiated field is more sensitive to the dose per fraction than is basal cell survival, implying a contribution to non-healing from damage to stromal elements such as the capillary endothelium.",Included

Emphasis was placed on accurate and extensive year-long dosimetry with etch-track detectors in conjunction with careful questioning about historic patterns of in-home mobility. Conditional logistic regression was used to model the outcome of cancer on radon exposure, while controlling for years of residency, smoking, education, income, and years of job exposure to known or potential carcinogens. Smoking was accounted for by nine categories: never smokers, four categories of current smokers, and four categories of former smokers. Radon exposure was divided into six categories (model 1) with break points at 25, 50, 75, 150, and 250 Bq m, the lowest being the reference. Surprisingly, the adjusted odds ratios (AORs) were, in order, 1.00, 0.53, 0.31, 0.47, 0.22, and 2.50 with the third category significantly below 1.0 (p < 0.05), and the second, fourth, and fifth categories approaching statistical significance (p < 0.1).

The induction and repair of DNA damage was measured at different time points after irradiation in the comet assay (single cell gel electrophoresis). These results were compared to the acute and late clinical reactions classified according to the RTOG grading system. Result(s): The radiation induced DNA damage decreased over time reflecting DNA repair. Cells of the AT individuals showed an elevated damage induction and a reduced repair capacity compared to patients with average tissue reactions. Fibroblasts of patients with increased acute and late side effects exhibited slower DNA repair. In addition to the known lack of cell cycle control, our results indicate that AT cells show reduced DNA repair capacity. Conclusion(s): The comet assay seems to be able to detect some types of increased individual radiation sensitivity. In contrast to other predictive in-vitro tests, the comet assay needs less time and fewer cells, which would be useful in a clinical setting.",Included
3573,"Long-Term Cognitive Functioning in Single-Dose Total-Body Gamma-Irradiated Rhesus Monkeys ( Macaca mulatta ). In this study, the effects of a potentially lethal radiation exposure on the brain for long-term cognitive sequelae were investigated using Rhesus macaques ( Macaca mulatta ) adopted from other facilities after analysis of acute radiation response via the Centers for Medical Countermeasures against Radiation (CMCR) network. Fifty-nine animals were given the opportunity to participate in cognitive cage-side testing. The animals that received single-dose gamma irradiation were significantly less likely to engage in cognitive testing than the controls, suggesting that irradiated animals may have differences in cognitive ability. Five irradiated (6.75-8.05 Gy) and three naive control animals self-selected, were extensively trained and administered a simple visual discrimination with reversal (SVD+R) task 2-3 times per week for 11-18 months. Each session consisted of 30 trials in which the animals were required to choose the correct visual stimulus for a food reward. After the initial presentation, the stimulus that signaled the presence of food was twice reversed once the animal reached criterion (90% accuracy across four consecutive sessions). While the limited sample size precluded definitive statistical analysis, irradiated animals took longer to reach the criterion subsequent to reversal than did control animals, suggesting a relative deficiency in cognitive flexibility. These results provide preliminary data supporting the potential use of a nonhuman primate model to study radiation-induced, late-delayed cognitive deficits.",Included

The tumors arose in the terminal ductal-lobular units as either lobular acinar carcinoma or cystadenocarcinoma or as papillary carcinomas within large ducts near the mammilla. About half the number of the males had terminal ductal-lobular carcinomas and all but 2 of the papillary duct carcinomas also arose in males. Large tumors frequently exhibited squamous, chondromatous, osseous, fatty and myoepitheliomatous types of tissues. In 2 irradiated males and 1 female the tumors metastasized. Whole-body irradiation did not produce significant changes in the number or sex distribution or in the morphology of mammary gland tumors in inbred or outbred guinea pigs. All females had cystic ovaries without increase in granulosa cells, 24 (66.6%) had uterine tumors and 13 (34.2%) had adrenal gland tumors; all males had atrophic testes, 5 (16.5%) had testicular and 6 (22.2%) had adrenal gland tumors.",Included
3617,"Radiation therapy in the treatment of partially resected meningiomas. To address the question of whether radiation therapy is beneficial in the management of partially resected meningiomas, we reviewed the records of all patients admitted to the University of California, San Francisco, between 1968 and 1978 who had a diagnosis of intracranial meningioma. The patients were divided into three groups: 51 patients had gross total resection and did not receive radiation therapy, 30 patients had subtotal resection and no radiation therapy, and 54 patients had subtotal resection followed by radiation therapy. The subtotal resection groups were similar in average age, male:female ratio, and tumor location, which allowed a valid comparison of the effects of irradiation. The recurrence rate in the total resection group was 4% (2 of 51 patients). Among patients in the subtotal resection groups, 60% of nonirradiated patients had a recurrence, compared with only 32% of the irradiated patients. The median time to recurrence was significantly longer in the irradiated group than in the nonirradiated group (125 vs. 66 months, P less than 0.05). There was no complication related to irradiation. These results provide convincing evidence that radiation therapy is beneficial in the treatment of partially resected meningiomas.",Included

AIM: The main objective was to delineate the rates and clinical course of sexual function and depression in cancer patients undergoing radiotherapy., PATIENTS AND METHODS: Forty-eight male and 90 female radiotherapy-naive outpatients with breast or pelvic cancer completed the International Index of Erectile Function (IIEF) or the Female Sexual Function Index (FSFI), and the Hamilton Depression Scale (HDS) prior to (phase 1), at the end of (phase 2) and 12 months after radiotherapy (phase 3)., RESULTS: Overall, the majority of patients (93.8% of males and 80% of females) experienced intense sexual dysfunction. At presentation, males reported severe erectile dysfunction that was significantly associated with age. However, only in sexual desire was the difference between baseline and phase 3 significant. In females, an improvement was observed in all parameters of FSFI between phase 1 and 3. Females with stage III disease achieved lower scores in almost all parameters of FSFI than those with stage II. Finally, although a quarter of patients reported elevated depression scores, depression was not related to sexual function., CONCLUSION: A significant proportion of cancer patients experience intense levels of sexual dysfunction and depression throughout radiotherapy and the subsequent year. Pelvic radiotherapy affected sexual function to a higher degree than did breast radiotherapy.",Included

3685,"Irradiation as a quarantine treatment for the solenopsis mealybug, Phenacoccus solenopsis. Phenacoccus solenopsis is an aggressively invasive species that targets agricultural and ornamental plants, thereby threatening the world cotton industry and other crops. P. solenopsis has been listed as a quarantine insect in Europe and China. The utilization of phytosanitary irradiation as a potential treatment for disinfesting agricultural commodities in trade has expanded rapidly in recent years. A reasonable dose of radiation to eliminate P. solenopsis needs to be determined, taking into account the side effects of radiation on agricultural products and the species-specific tolerance of the insect to radiation. We applied radiation ranging from 50 to 200. Gy to P. solenopsis to determine the optimal dose. Both the radiation dose and the developmental stage of the insect were independent variables. Higher doses of radiation or lesser mature insect stages provided more effective treatment. In nymphs, a radiation dose of 100. Gy caused extinction of the irradiated population by disrupting ovary development, while 150. Gy caused 100% mortality. In adults, all tested doses of irradiation did not affect longevity, but we were able to prevent reproduction with high (150 and 200. Gy) doses. In P. solenopsis, a 100. Gy dose of radiation could eliminate the irradiated population in two generations. The mortality curve showed a steep slope beyond 150. Gy; thus, if killing all of the insects in a shorter amount of time is necessary, 200. Gy may be a reasonable dose for the quarantine treatment of the solenopsis mealybug. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.",Included
3693,"Cognitive and radiological effects of radiotherapy in patients with low-grade glioma: long-term follow-up. BACKGROUND: Our previous study on cognitive functioning among 195 patients with low-grade glioma (LGG) a mean of 6 years after diagnosis suggested that the tumour itself, rather than the radiotherapy used to treat it, has the most deleterious effect on cognitive functioning; only high fraction dose radiotherapy (>2 Gy) resulted in significant added cognitive deterioration. The present study assesses the radiological and cognitive abnormalities in survivors of LGG at a mean of 12 years after first diagnosis., METHODS: Patients who have had stable disease since the first assessment were invited for follow-up cognitive assessment (letter-digit substitution test, concept shifting test, Stroop colour-word test, visual verbal learning test, memory comparison test, and categoric word fluency). Compound scores in six cognitive domains (attention, executive functioning, verbal memory, working memory, psychomotor functioning, and information processing speed) were calculated to detect differences between patients who had radiotherapy and patients who did not have radiotherapy. White-matter hyperintensities and global cortical atrophy were rated on MRI scans., FINDINGS: 65 patients completed neuropsychological follow-up at a mean of 12 years (range 6-28 years). 32 (49%) patients had received radiotherapy (three had fraction doses >2 Gy). The patients who had radiotherapy had more deficits that affected attentional functioning at the second follow-up, regardless of fraction dose, than those who did not have radiotherapy (-1.6 [SD 2.4] vs -0.1 [1.3], p=0.003; mean difference 1.4, 95% CI 0.5-2.4). The patients who had radiotherapy also did worse in measures of executive functioning (-2.0 [3.7] vs -0.5 [1.2], p=0.03; mean difference 1.5, 0.2-2.9) and information processing speed (-2.0 [3.7] vs -0.6 [1.5], p=0.05; mean difference 0.8, 0.009-1.6]) between the two assessments. Furthermore, attentional functioning deteriorated significantly between the first and second assessments in patients who had radiotherapy (p=0.25). In total, 17 (53%) patients who had radiotherapy developed cognitive disabilities deficits in at least five of 18 neuropsychological test parameters compared with four (27%) patients who were radiotherapy naive. White-matter hyperintensities and global cortical atrophy were associated with worse cognitive functioning in several domains., INTERPRETATION: Long-term survivors of LGG who did not have radiotherapy had stable radiological and cognitive status. By contrast, patients with low-grade glioma who received radiotherapy showed a progressive decline in attentional functioning, even those who received fraction doses that are regarded as safe (</=2 Gy). These cognitive deficits are associated with radiological abnormalities. Our results suggest that the risk of long-term cognitive and radiological compromise that is associated with radiotherapy should be considered when treatment is planned., FUNDING: Kaptein Fonds; Schering Plough.",Included
3698,"Ionizing radiation causes a dose-dependent release of transforming growth factor alpha in vitro from irradiated xenografts and during palliative treatment of hormone-refractory prostate carcinoma. PURPOSE: Characterize the radiation response for transforming growth factor (TGF) alpha shedding in vitro and in vivo. We also report the shedding of TGF alpha by patients undergoing irradiation for hormone-refractory prostate cancer., EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: TGF alpha levels were determined by ELISA. DU145 xenografts were established on the flanks of athymic nu/nu mice. Expression of phospho-extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK)1/2 and phospho-epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and the DNA repair proteins XRCC1 and ERCC1 were determined by Western analyses., RESULTS: Exposure to ionizing radiation results in a dose-dependent release of TGF alpha. Once released, TGF alpha stimulates EGFR-ERK1/2 signaling in unirradiated cells. Blockade of the EGFR with the tyrphostin AG1478 eliminates the up-regulation XRCC1 and ERCC1 by TGF alpha or irradiation. After irradiation, cells are refractory to additional transactivation of EGFR by additional irradiation for 8 to 12 hours. Irradiation during this refractory period does not increase the expression of XRCC1 or ERCC1. Ligand activation of EGFR is maintained during the refractory period. Irradiation of DU145 xenografts also results in the activation of ERK1/2, release of TGF alpha, and a similar refractory period. Ionizing irradiation also results in the release of TGF alpha for patients undergoing radiation therapy for hormone-refractory prostate cancer., CONCLUSIONS: Irradiation results in a dose-dependent increase in TGF alpha capable of enhancing the growth of DU145 xenografts. TGF alpha is also shed following radiation therapy of patients treated for hormone-refractory prostate cancer. Radiation transactivation of the EGFR produces a radio-refractory period, which lasts for several hours. During this period, additional irradiation fails to induce XRCC1, ERCC1, or additional TGF alpha release.",Included

Purpose: To evaluate the effect of radiation therapy including intraluminal brachyterapy with iridium-192 on survival of patients with malignant biliary strictures (cholangiocarcinoma, histologically improved) treated with metallic stent in a prospective randomised study. Method and materials: In the prospective randomised study, 21 patients with cholangiocarcinoma were treated with implantation of percutaneous stents followed with intraluminal Ir-192 brachytherapy (mean dose 30 Gy) and external radiotherapy (mean dose 50 Gy) and 21 patients were treated only with stents insertion. We did not find any statistically significant differences in age and tumor localization between these two groups of patients. Result(s): All the patients died. In the group of patients treated with brachytherapy and with stent implantation, the mean survival time was 387.9 days. In the group of patients treated only with stent insertion the mean survival was 298 days. In effort to eliminate possible effect of external radiotherapy we treated the control group of eight patients with cholangiocarcinoma by stent insertion and brachyterapy only. Conclusion(s): Our results show that combined radiation therapy could extend the survival in the patients with cholangiocarcinoma obstruction. © 2007 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

2398,"Does salivary gland scintigraphy predict response to pilocarpine in patients with post-radiotherapy xerostomia?. This study was undertaken to determine whether standard salivary gland scintigraphy may be used for the objective assessment of salivary gland sialogogues, in particular oral pilocarpine, in the treatment of post-radiotherapy xerostomia. Nine patients, with xerostomia following radiotherapy to the head and neck region underwent salivary gland scintigraphy with technetium-99m pertechnetate (40 MBq) both before and following 1 month of oral pilocarpine (5 mg tds). For each scan, the percentage uptake in the first 14 min, the peak uptake, time to peak uptake and the percentage of activity excreted following lemon juice stimulation were calculated. The results were correlated with the subjective response as assessed by questionnaire and visual analogue scale. We found no correlation between subjective response and any of the four scan parameters analysed. We could not identify any parameter that predicted those patients who would respond to pilocarpine. In addition, only one parameter, the percentage of activity excreted following stimulation, correlated with previous dose of radiotherapy to the gland. In conclusion, in this study salivary gland scintigraphy did not appear to correlate with or predict response to oral pilocarpine. However, future studies might consider performing salivary gland scintigraphy prior to radiotherapy as well as at differing time points following the commencement of pilocarpine.",Excluded
2663,"Radon testing in rapid access lung clinics: an opportunity for secondary prevention. Background: Radon is a naturally occurring radioactive gas and a level 1 carcinogen. It acts synergistically with cigarette smoke to cause lung cancer. In Ireland, radon is estimated to be associated with 13 % of all lung cancers. Rapid access lung cancer clinics (RALC's) were established in the UK and Ireland to improve lung cancer management outcomes. There has been no attempt to date to provide advice on household radon exposure assessments in this setting. Aim(s): We performed a prospective feasibility study of radon assessment in our RALC to test the hypothesis that patients would avail of this service and that it would provide an opportunity for secondary prevention in at risk persons. Method(s): We investigated household radon levels in consecutive patients who were newly referred with symptoms of lung cancer to the RALC in Galway University Hospital, Ireland over a 6-month period. Result(s): Of 50 patients enrolled, 42 returned valid results. Overall 21 % of patients had radon levels recorded above the national reference level. Only 5 % of patients were aware of the association between radon gas and lung cancer. Smokers were significantly less likely to engage fully in radon testing. Conclusion(s): The development of RALC's offers a novel opportunity to integrate the concepts of radon exposure, cigarette smoking and the development of lung cancer, and to reinforce this message in the minds of at risk patients.Copyright © 2016, Royal Academy of Medicine in Ireland.",Excluded

Purpose: We evaluated our therapeutic results in patients with paranasal sinus or nasal cavity malignanc ies treated by robotic radiosurgery. Materials: The medical charts of 17 patients with paranasal or nasal cavity malignancies treated by robotic radiosurgery (RRS)+/- external beam radiotherapy were assessed in this retrospective study. Robotic radiosurgery was given with CyberKnife (Accuray Inc., Sunnyvale, CAl. There were 9 male and 8 female patients. Primary site was maxillary sinus in 6 patients, ethmoid sinus in 5 patients, nasal cavity in 3 patients and sphenoid sinus in 1 patient. Histopatholigal diagnosis was mostly squamous cell cancer (7 cases), as other pathologies were soft tissue sarcoma (4 cases), malignant melanoma (3 cases), adenocarcinoma (1 case), and adenoid cystic carcinoma (2 cases). RRS was given as re-Irradiation in 4 patients with recurrent disease, whereas it was primary treatment modality in 13 patients (RRS alone in 7 cases with 28.5-37.5 Gy in 3-5 fractions, and boost dose after EBRT in 6 cases with 1535 Gy in 35 fractions). The median prescription isodose was 81% (range, 75-85%). Seven patients received chemotherapy either prior to RRS (3 patients), or concurrent with EBRT (3 patients), or adjuvant (1 patient). Two cases with T4 tumors received elective neck EBRT. Result(s): Median follow-up time was 21 months (7-32 months). Complete response, partial response and stabile response was obtained in 7, 3 and 2 patients respectively. Overall response rate was 59% (Complete and partial response). Progression at primary site was observed in 3 cases, as one of them died of disease and two of them died of distant metastasis. RRS was generally well tolerated. There were no grade III-IV acute RTOG toxicity. Osteoradionecrosis was detected in 2 patients (one case receiving re-irradiat ion, other case receiving 30 Gy RRS alone in 3 fractions). Those 2 patients had also serious ipsilate ral facial pain requiring narcotic analgesics, and they also received hyperbaric oxygen therapy and antibiotic therapy with no need of surgical debridement. No visual acuity loss was observed during follow-up. Minor bleeding, which was spontaneously stopped, was seen in one patient. Conclusion(s): Robotic radiosurgery seems to be an alternative and tolerable therapeutic option either in recurrent or primary paranasal sinus and nasal cavity malignancies. However, longer follow-up periods are required to see the safety of RRS particulary in terms of late effects.",Excluded
2940,"Plasma concentration of Donepezil did not accurately predict tissue concentration: A dynamic whole-body PET study in humans. Background: Donepezil hydrochloride (DNP) is acetylcholine esterase inhibitor most prescribed in patients with Alzheimer's disease. We previously reported its accumulation to brain, myocardium, and pancreas using PET with 11C-DNP. Objects: The purpose of this study was to reveal whether the DNP concentration in these organs could be predicted by measuring its plasma concentration. Method(s): Ten healthy volunteers (5 men and 5 women, age range from 40 to 58 year old, mean age 48.3 year old) were enrolled. 11C-DNP (220 MBq, less than 7mug) was intravenously infused for 1 min immediately followed by 7 repeated whole-body scans (7 min data acquisition in each scan) for 60 min. Radioactivity concentration in brain, pancreas, and myocardium was measured by PMOD software. Time activity curve (TAC) in plasma obtained from arterialized venous blood was measured at 10 time points. Metabolite fraction was measured at 30 min by using HPLC. We assumed linear increase in metabolite fraction during scanning and obtained metabolite-corrected TAC (cTAC) of 11C-DNP. We examined the correlation between integrated TAC and tissue radioactivity of brain, pancreas, and myocardium. We also examined the correlation between plasma radioactivity at single time point and tissue radioactivity in these organs. Result(s): There was no significant correlation between integrated plasma radioactivity (0 to 30 min, 0 to 50 min) and tissue radioactivity at 30 min or 50 min in brain (p=0.066, p = 0.096), pancreas (p=0.156, p=0.162), and myocardium (p=0.308, p=0.481). Metabolite fraction of 11CDNP in plasma was 21.2 +/- 8.6% at 30 min. By using cTAC, we also found no significant correlation between plasma and tissue radioactivity. Conclusion(s): Although plasma concentration has been usually employed to predict tissue concentration of drugs, in case of DNP, plasma concentration did not accurately estimate tissue concentration. PET with positron emitting nuclide-labeled drug may provide more accurate and direct information on the tissue concentration of drugs.",Excluded

The very foundation of cooperation between the United States (US) and Russia (former Soviet Union) in space exploration is a direct result of the mutual desire for scientific understanding and the creation of a collaborative mechanismthe Joint Working Group (JWG) on Space Biology and Medicine. From the dawn of the space age, it has been the quest of humankind to understand its place in the universe. While nations can and do solve problems independently, it takes nations, working together, to accomplish great things. The formation of the JWG provided an opportunity for the opening of a series of productive relationships between the superpowers, the US and the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (USSR); and served as a justification for continued relationship for medical assistance in spaceflight, and to showcase Earth benefits from space medicine research. This relationship has been played out on an international scale with the construction and operation of the International Space Station. The fundamental reason for this successful endeavor is a direct result of the spirit and perseverance of the men and women who have worked diligently side-by-side to promote science and move our understanding of space forward. This manuscript provides a historical perspective of the JWG; how it came about; its evolution; what it accomplished; and what impact it has had and continues to have in the 21st century with regard to human spaceflight and space life sciences research. It captures the spirit of this group, which has been in continuous existence for over 40 years, and provides a never before reported summary of its activities.

AIM: To report the authors' experience with the use of opaque intraocular lenses (IOL) in diplopia unresponsive to traditional management strategies, and to assess patients' satisfaction and the visual function of patients following insertion of opaque IOL using the Visual Function Index (VF-14)., SETTINGS: Royal Victoria Infirmary, Newcastle upon Tyne, UK., METHOD: Data were obtained on all patients who underwent insertion of an opaque IOL at our institution between 2002 and 2006. Patients were interviewed by telephone. Any visual function impairment was assessed using the VF-14 questionnaire. Patients were also asked to score subjectively their overall satisfaction with the visual outcome after opaque IOL insertion., RESULTS: The authors studied 12 patients (n = 12) who had insertion of opaque IOL. All patients had constant and persistent diplopia unresponsive to other treatments acceptable to the patient. The median duration of diplopia was 5.5 years (interquartile range was 2.4-17.3 years). The postoperative VF-14 ranged from 75 to 100, and the mean VF-14 was 91 (95% CI 83-99). Three patients reported a maximum score of 100.

Ninety-one laparotomy-staged (LAP) IA and IIA Hodgkin's disease (HD) patients were analyzed to evaluate the prognostic significance of stage, mediastinal status, extranodal disease and histology. Forty IA patients were treated with radiotherapy (XRT) only; of 51 IIA patients, 44 received XRT only and 7 had additional chemotherapy. Disease-free survival (DFS) at 5 and 10 years was 81% and 70%, respectively, with overall survival (S) of 93% and 86%, respectively. Disease-free survival for IA patients (93% at 5 and 10 years) was significantly superior to IIA (73% at 5 years, 52% at 10 years). Survival differences were not statistically significant. For IIA patients receiving XRT only, large mediastinal disease was an adverse factor for DFS. Small mediastinal disease in IIA was significantly better than no mediastinal disease. For the whole group of LAP IA and IIA treated by XRT only, three prognostic groups were identified: (1) Stage IA and Stage IIA with mediastinal disease, but less than 7.5 cm in width was highly favorable with less than 10% relapse; (2) Stage IIA nonmediastinal had an intermediate prognosis with relapse in about 33%; (3) Stage IIA large mediastinal (greater than or equal to 7.5 cm) had an unfavorable DFS with relapse in about 55%. The third group contained a highly unfavorable subset with mediastinal masses greater than 10 cm, all of whom relapsed. Salvage therapy was successful in 60% of relapsing patients. In the context of relatively effective salvage therapy, the role of adjuvant chemotherapy in adverse prognostic groups is discussed and it is concluded that the only clearly justifiable use for adjuvant chemotherapy is in patients with massive (greater than 10 cm) mediastinal adenopathy.",Excluded
608,"Weekly 70 Gy thoracic radiotheraphy concurrent with docetaxel or paclitaxel after induction chemotherapy of patients with locally advanced non-small cell lung cancer: Prospective study of tolerance and efficacy. Introduction: Chemotherapy (CT) and thoracic radiotherapy (TRT) constitute the standard care of patients with inoperable/unresectable locally advanced NSCLC. However, the optimal schedule of treatment remains to be determined. Method(s): A prospective study was conducted in patients with locally advanced stage IIIA or IIIB NSCLC, to determine the tolerability and local control obtained with 7 weekly courses of concurrent chemo-radiotherapy using Docetaxel (D: 20 mg/m2) or Paclitaxel (P: 60 mg/m2) and TRT (2 Gy daily Monday through Friday, totalizing 70 Gy in the seven weeks), after 3 cycles of cisplatinum-based induction chemotherapy (cisplatinum + gemcitabine +/- vinorelbine). Result(s): From December 1999 to December 2004, fifty two out of 129 patients treated with induction chemotherapy and at least with stable disease were considered eligible for analysis. Twenty seven were treated with docetaxel (D) and twenty five with paclitaxel (P). The average of weeks of treatment was 5 for D (range 7-3) and 6 for P (7-1), and 40% and 58% of patients respectively in each group completed 7 weeks and received the programmed doses. Significant toxicity during concurrent therapy included (D/P %): esophagitis (grade I, 22/18; grade II, 25/29; grade III, 30/8), pneumonitis (grades I-II, 14/5), diarrhea (grades I-II, 14/0). The percentage of local progression and median time elapsed were 41% and 180 days in the D group of patients, and 46% and 240 days in the P group. Conclusion(s): No definitive conclusions can be made, considering the small size of the sample in this study, but the observed trends suggest that concurrent chemo-radiotherapy employing TRT and Docetaxel or Paclitaxel administered weekly offer similar local efficacy, Paclitaxel showing a lower toxicity.",Excluded

Background: Nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) is one of the most highly radiosensitive malignancies; however, some locally advanced NPC patients experienced local recurrence even though they received aggressive treatment regimens. Defining the tumor volume precisely is important to escalate the total dose required for the primary tumor. In this study, we aimed to investigate the feasibility and efficacy of dose escalation guided by DW-MRI in patients with locally advanced NPC. Patients and Methods: A total of 230 patients with locally advanced NPC treated with intensive modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) at Sichuan Cancer Hospital between January 2010 and January 2015 were enrolled in this retrospective study. All the patients were treated with all-course of simultaneous integrated boost-IMRT. DW-MRI-guided dose escalation with 2.2-2.5 Gy/F, qd for 1-3daysor1.2-1.5 Gy/F, bid for 1-3 days were prescribed to 123 patients. Survival and complication of the patients were evaluated, and multivariate analysis was performed. Result(s): The median follow-up of patients in the DW-MRI-guided dose-escalation group and the conventional group was 48 months (range 8-88 months) and 52 months (range 6-90 months), respectively. The 5-year overall survival rate, distant metastasis-free survival rate, progression-free survival, and local recurrence-free survival (LRFS) of patients in the dose-escalation group and the conventional group were 88% vs 82.5% (p = 0.244), 86.1% vs 83.3% (p = 0.741), 82.2% vs 76.6% (p = 0.286), and 89.1% vs 80.1% (p = 0.029), respectively. Multivariate analysis showed that dose escalation was independent prognostic factor for LRFS (HR 0.386, 95% CI 0.163-0.909, p = 0.03). Conclusion(s): DW-MRI-guided dose escalation is a feasible strategy to improve local control of patients with locally advanced NPC.

All patients were diagnosed by MRI before procedure. They were confirmed by postoperative histopathology or further verification by MRI. The irradiation dose of Gamma knife around tumors were 11-16 Gy (mean 14.3 +/-1.1 Gy), covered by 45%-50% isodose line and ensured that the exposure dose of the optic cross was less than 8 Gy. In the first year after operation, they were followed up at 3, 6, 9, and 12 months, and after that, the clinical efficacy, surgical complications and tumor volume were evaluated once a year. Result(s): Thirty-five patients were followed up for 12-77 months (mean 36 +/-4months). No surgery-related optic nerve injury and new cranial nerve injury occurred in all cases. Symptomatic patients were 28 (80%) and symptomatic improvement rate was 96. 4% (n = 27), among them, the symptoms were improved in 15 cases (53. 6%), and the symptoms disappeared in 12 cases (42. 9%), did not have any change in 1 (3. 6%) case, and no symptom deterioration occurred. The symptom improvement time was 2-7 months after surgery (mean 3.7 +/-0.3 months). Imaging follow-up revealed that in 35patients with cavernous sinus cavernous hemangioma treated by gamma knife radiosurgery, the tumor volume was significantly reduced after treatment compared with that before treatment, and the difference was statistically significant (8.8 +/-0.9 cm3 vs. 32. 6 +/-3. 6 cm3, t = 8. 492, P < 0. 01). The rates of tumor volume change were <=25%, 26%-50%, 51%-75%, and >=75%. There were 3 patients (8.6%), 2 (5.7%), 8 (22.9%), and 22 (62. 9%).respectively. Conclusion(s): Gamma knife radiosurgery is safe and effective in the treatment of cavernous sinus cavernous hemangioma. It can be used as the preferred treatment modality for this disease, but long-term follow-up is needed to observe its long-term efficacy.Copyright © 2018 Society of China University Journals in Natural Sciences.

3572,"Preliminary exploration of tolerability in preoperative stereotactic ablation radiotherapy combined with surgical treatment for renal cell carcinoma and inferior vena cava tumor thrombus. Background and objectives Stereotactic ablation radiotherapy (SABR) has shown excellent control rates for renal cell carcinoma (RCC) currently. But relatively few studies expatiated the tolerability and safety of preoperative SABR combined with surgical treatment for RCC and inferior vena cava tumor thrombus (IVC-TT). Materials and methods The clinical data of six patients with level II IVC-TT was prospectively collected. Treatment planning CT with slice thickness of 1 milimeter and MRI was fused for target delineation. The IVC-TT received a total radiation dose of 30 Gy in six 5 Gy fractions, calculated with a Monte Carlo algorithms.The dose was prescribed to the 84% isodose line via 100-150 non-coplanar photon beams of 6 MV and 3D optimization ensuring >95% target volume (PTV) coverage. After completion of SABR, the patients underwent thrombectomy. Doselimiting toxicity (DLT) was defined as grade 3 or worse gastrointestinal/ genitourinary toxicity by Common Terminology Criteria of Adverse Events (version 4). Postoperative complications were graded according to the modified Clavien classifications, respectively. Results A total of 6 patients (4 men and 2 women) were treated on protocol. After 7-14 days, 3 patients underwent open radical nephrectomy and inferior vena cava thrombectomy and 3 patients underwent pure laparoscopic surgery. All 6 patients tolerated SABR well without possibly treatment-related acute toxicities. The average surgery time was (383.3 +/-88.7) min. The average blood loss volume was (1475.0 +/- 1515.8) mL. 2 cases underwent inferior vena cava wall resection because of tumor invasion. The average postoperative hospitalization of was (5.8 +/-1.2) d. Early postoperative complications occurred in 4 case of Clavien I according to modified Clavien classifications. Median (range) follow-up was 8 months (1-22 months). There was no postoperative recurrence or tumor specific death. Conclusion Our initial clinical results show that dose of 30 Gy in 6 fraction has been achieved successfully without treatment-related acute toxicities. preoperative SABR combined with surgical treatment was relatively safe.",Excluded
1379,"Effect of cobalt-60 gamma radiation on reproductive disturbance in freshwater prawn Macrobrachium rosenbergii (De Man, 1879). The present study was designed to evaluate the effect of acute level of 60Co gamma radiation on fecundity of freshwater prawn Macrobrachium rosenbergii. Prawns were exposed to four different dose levels (3, 30, 300 and 3000 mGy) and their reproductive disturbances i.e Gonadosomatic Index (GSI), Egg Clutch somatic Index (ESI), Egg Counts and Egg hatching rates were calculated. The experimental group showed significant reduction in GSI (0.47 +/- 0.01) & ESI (1.22 +/- 0.08) after exposure to 60Co gamma radiation. Egg Count (3713 +/- 21) and Egg hatching rates (3798 +/- 11) were significantly reduced in all irradiated groups. The number of dead larva increased with the increasing level of doses. With the increase in dosage level, the gonad and egg clutch weight were decreased which likely lead to reduced number of eggs. Our results proved that even low level of ionizing radiation (60Co) affects the fecundities of freshwater crustacean M. rosenbergii.Copyright © 2019 The Authors",Excluded
2176,"""Beach Lifeguards' Sun Exposure and Sun Protection in Spain"". Background: Sunburn is the main avoidable cause of skin cancer. Beach lifeguards spend many hours exposed to the effects of solar radiation during their work day, precisely at times of the year when levels of solar irradiation are highest. The aim of this study is to quantify the risk to beach lifeguards of sun exposure. Method(s): A descriptive cross-sectional study was carried out in the Western Costa del Sol, southern Spain, during the summer of 2018. The research subjects were recruited during a skin cancer prevention course for beach lifeguards. All participants were invited to complete a questionnaire on their habits, attitudes, and knowledge related to sun exposure. In addition, ten were specially monitored using personal dosimeters for three consecutive days, and the results were recorded in a photoprotection diary. A descriptive analysis (mean and standard deviation for the quantitative variables) was performed, and inter-group differences were evaluated using the Mann-Whitney U test. Result(s): Two hundred fifteen lifeguards completed the questionnaire, and 109 met the criteria for inclusion in this analysis. The mean age was 23.8 years (SD: 5.1), 78.0% were male, 71.5% were phototype III or IV (Fitzpatrick's phototype), and 77.1% had experienced at least one painful sunburn during the previous summer. The mean daily personal ultraviolet exposure per day, the minimal erythema dose, and the standard erythema dose, in J/m2, were 634.7 [standard deviation (SD): 356.2], 2.5 (SD: 1.4) and 6.35 (SD: 3.6), respectively. Conclusion(s): Beach lifeguards receive very high doses of solar radiation during the work day and experience correspondingly high rates of sunburn. Intervention strategies to modify their sun exposure behavior and working environment are necessary to reduce the risk of skin cancer for these workers and to promote early diagnosis of the disease.Copyright © 2020 The Authors",Excluded
1897,"Linear accelerator-based stereotactic radiosurgery for limited, locally persistent, and recurrent nasopharyngeal carcinoma: efficacy and complications. PURPOSE: To evaluate the efficacy and complication of linear accelerator-based stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) when used as salvage treatment for early-stage persistent and recurrent nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) after primary radiotherapy (RT)., MATERIALS AND METHODS: Between March 1998 and June 2001, 18 patients (15 men and 3 women; median age 46 years, range 32-84) with locally persistent or recurrent NPC confined to the nasopharynx (rT1) or with limited extension to the nasal fossa or parapharyngeal space (rT2) were treated by SRS. Thirteen patients had rT1 disease and 5 had rT2 disease. Most patients had disease not amenable to surgery or brachytherapy. All patients had undergone previous radical RT. Persistent disease was defined as tumor relapse within 4 months of completion of primary RT, and recurrence as tumor relapse beyond 4 months. Seven patients were treated for persistent disease, eight for a first recurrence, and three for a second recurrence. SRS was performed using multiple noncoplanar arcs of photons delivered to the target volume, which was defined by axial CT at a 3 mm thickness, supplemented by MRI in selected patients (67%). The median target volume was 5.3 cm(3) (range 2.2-16.9). The median SRS dose was 12.5 Gy (range 11-14) delivered to the 80% isodose line. All patients underwent serial nasopharyngoscopy and imaging after SRS. The median follow-up was 26 months (range 11-48)., RESULTS: After SRS, 16 (89%) of 18 patients had complete regression of tumor as assessed by nasopharyngoscopy and biopsy. Four patients with an initial complete response to SRS subsequently developed local relapse again, with one recurrence developing outside the target volume 8 months after SRS and three within the target volume at 6-26 months after SRS. Two patients with local disease controlled by SRS developed relapse in other sites (neck node and liver metastases). The actuarial 2-year local control rate after SRS was 72%. Patients treated for persistent disease had a better local control rate (100%; 7 of 7) than those treated for recurrent disease (46%; 5 of 11). Patients with rT1 disease also had a better outcome after SRS compared with those with rT2 disease, with a control rate of 77% (10 of 13) for rT1 disease and 40% (2 of 5) for rT2 disease. Treatments were well tolerated, with no acute side effects. One patient had radiologic evidence of temporal lobe necrosis, although the right temporal lobe had already received a high dose during prior RT. That patient also developed additional local recurrence and liver metastases and died. The actuarial 2-year survival rate was 86%., CONCLUSIONS: Our preliminary results indicate that SRS is an effective treatment modality for persistent and recurrent early-stage NPC, with early control rates comparable to other salvage treatments such as brachytherapy and nasopharyngectomy. A modest SRS dose at 12.5 Gy also appears to be effective and is associated with minimal morbidities. More clinical experience and longer follow-up are needed to validate our results and to address fully the role of SRS in salvaging local failures of NPC.",Excluded
805,"Eos, o-arm and standard spine radiographs; What is the cumulative radiation exposure during current scoliosis management?. Background/introduction: During the course of assessment and treatment for AIS, patients are subjected to repeated radiological exposure. Only a few studies have evaluated the total absorbed radiation dose from standard radiography and EOS during follow-up for scoliosis. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to evaluate and compare total radiation dose exposure from all modalities for a cohort of AIS patients. Purpose of the study: The primary aim of this study was to determine the radiation exposure of AIS patients during scoliosis management. Moreover, this study aimed to compare follow-up algorithms among international spine centers. Material(s) and Method(s): A retrospective review on radiation exposure of patients treated for AIS. Inclusions: patients followed for AIS from 2013 to 2016 without neuromuscular diseases. The O-arm conebeam CT scanner was used for 3D navigation in all surgically managed patients, low dose protocols were used (70 kVp, 80 mAs). A survey asking for information on radiological algorithms and imaging frequencies was sent to a number of international spine centers for comparison with in-house algorithm. Result(s): 61 patients were included, 19 were treated conservatively (M/F: 6/13) and 42 surgically (M/F: 11/31). Median follow up time for the conservative group was 8 (range 0-51) months and 37 (range 13-163) months for the surgical group. Median number of X-rays/EOS were; 2 (range 0-20)/2 (range 0-17) for the conservative group and 15 (range 2-57)/11(range 0-26) for the surgery group. Patients undergoing surgery received a median cumulative radiation dose of 10.31 mSv (range 3.79-20.43) vs. a median dose of 1.09 mSv (range 0.22-7.17) for those treated conservatively. Approximately 25% (39.04/161.82 mSv) of total intraoperative radiation dose for all patients was a result of O-arm 2D fluoroscopy. A mean of 11 levels of the spine were fused during correction surgeries. Median Cobb angle at the beginning/end of follow up were 19-(range 10--50-)/23- (range 12--65-) for the conservative group and 44- (range 10--80-)/15- (range 4--30-) for the surgery group. Median Cobb angle before the surgery was 52- (range 36--82-). The results of the questionnaire showed great variety of radiological follow-up algorithms among 8 spine centers without adherence to any of the published consensus statements. Conclusion(s): Surgically treated patients were, as anticipated, exposed to more, radiation dose than those treated conservatively, almost 10-fold more, owing mainly to intraoperative 3D scans and a larger numbers of radiological follow-up examinations. The use of conebeam CT-based 3D navigation elevates patient safety during deformity surgery. However, patients are potentially exposed to a significant amount of radiation depending on protocol and use of 2D fluoroscopy. Further awareness of ways to reduce radiation dose and optimize radiological protocols is warranted in order to decrease radiation-induced malignancy.",Excluded
2664,"Triiodothyronine increases calcium loss in a bed rest antigravity model for space flight. Bed rest has been used as a model to simulate the effects of space flight on bone metabolism. Thyroid hormones accelerate bone metabolism. Thus, supraphysiologic doses of this hormone might be used as a model to accelerate bone metabolism during bed rest and potentially simulate space flight. The objective of the study was to quantitate the changes in bone turnover after low doses of triiodothyronine (T(3)) added to short-term bed rest. Nine men and 5 women were restricted to bed rest for 28 days with their heads positioned 6 degrees below their feet. Subjects were randomly assigned to receive either placebo or oral T(3) at doses of 50 to 75 microg/d in a single-blind fashion. Calcium balance was measured over 5-day periods; and T(3), thyroxine, thyroid-stimulating hormone, immunoreactive parathyroid hormone, osteocalcin, bone alkaline phosphatase, and urinary deoxypyridinoline were measured weekly. Triiodothyronine increased 2-fold in the men and 5-fold in the women during treatment, suppressing both thyroxine and thyroid-stimulating hormone. Calcium balance was negative by 300 to 400 mg/d in the T(3)-treated volunteers, primarily because of the increased fecal loss that was not present in the placebo group. Urinary deoxypyridinoline to creatinine ratio, a marker of bone resorption, increased 60% in the placebo group during bed rest, but more than doubled in the T(3)-treated subjects (P < .01), suggesting that bone resorption was enhanced by treatment with T(3). Changes in serum osteocalcin and bone-specific alkaline phosphatase, markers of bone formation, were similar in T(3)- and placebo-treated subjects. Triiodothyronine increases bone resorption and fecal calcium loss in subjects at bed rest.",Excluded
1865,"Estimating the burden of lung cancer and the efficiency of home radon mitigation systems in some Canadian provinces. Lung cancer (LC) is the leading cause of death of cancer in Canada in both men and women, and indoor radon is the second leading cause of LC after tobacco smoking. The Population Attributable Risk (PAR) is used to assess radon exposure risk. In this work we estimate the burden of LC in some Canadian provinces. We use the PAR to identify the radon levels responsible for most LC cases. Finally, we use the PAR function of the two variables, radon action and target levels, to search for a possible optimal mitigation program., METHODS: The LC burden for Ontario, Alberta, Manitoba, Quebec and British Columbia was estimated using provincial radon and mortality data. Then the PAR and LC cases for these provinces were estimated over the period 2006-2009 at different given indoor radon exposure levels. Finally, the PAR function when radon action levels and radon target levels are variables was analyzed., RESULTS: The highest burden of LC in 2006-2009 was in Ontario and Quebec. During the period 2006-2009, 6% of houses in Ontario, 9% of houses in Alberta, 19% of houses in Manitoba, 7% of houses in Quebec, and 5% of houses in British Columbia had radon levels higher than 200Bq/m3 and were responsible about 913, 211, 260, 972, and 258 lives, respectively. Radon mitigation programs could have prevented these LC cases. The BEIR VI assumption for the United States (US) population, 95% of LC deaths in men and 90% of LC deaths in women are Ever-Smokers (ES), can be applied to the Canadian population. The PAR is a linear function in the target radon value with an estimated slope of 0.0001 for Ontario, Alberta, Quebec and British Columbia, and 0.0004 for Manitoba. The PAR is almost a square root function in the radon action level. The PAR is sensitive to changes in the radon mitigation program and as such, any improvement is a worthwhile investment.

3194,"Analysis of Patients Unable to Undergo Adjuvant Chemotherapy after Surgery in Stage IIIA/B Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer: Will They Benefit from Mediastinal Radiotherapy?. Objectives The role of postoperative mediastinal radiotherapy in completely resected non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and pathological N2 disease is controversial. In clinical practice, not all lung cancer patients with histologically confirmed N2 disease and a high risk for local recurrence are able to undergo postoperative concurrent radio/chemotherapy due to their physical condition or postoperative morbidities. Mediastinal radiotherapy is less compromising than a combination of radio/chemotherapy and seems likely to be tolerable for limited patients to achieve better local tumor control. Materials and Methods All patients included in this retrospective analysis were excluded from postoperative adjuvant combination chemo/radiotherapy due to their comorbidity, advanced age, or a complicated postoperative course. Three-dimensional conformal radiotherapy of the mediastinal lymph node stations (mean dose: 50 Gy; range: 50-54 Gy) in patients with R0 resection, additional boost of 10 Gy in patients with R1 or R2 resection, was performed postoperatively. Results A total of 110 patients were included in this analysis. Mean survival was 25.5 +/- 19.2 months. The 1-, 3-, and 5-year survival was 75.4, 38.7, and 26.2%, respectively. Postoperative complications and the development of distant metastases did not correlate (p = 0.7). Distant metastases proved to be a significant prognostic factor of survival (p < 0.0001). Local recurrence was seen in a total of three patients (2.7%). Five-year survival of patients developing major postoperative complications was significantly inferior (p = 0.04) to those without postoperative complications. The extent of surgery had a significant impact on survival-5-year survival after lobectomy was significantly longer than after pneumonectomy (p = 0.029). R1 resection had no significant impact on the survival rates (p = 0.67). Discussion Stage III-N2 NSCLC patients with multiple comorbidities or a complicated postoperative course after surgery may benefit from modern mediastinal radiotherapy. Surgery and postoperative mediastinal radiotherapy can achieve local tumor control. Distant metastases have the highest impact on the prognosis. Pneumonectomy, however, should be avoided in stage III NSCLC, when possible. Copyright Georg Thieme Verlag KG Stuttgart . New York.",Excluded
2236,"Physician and nurse knowledge about patient radiation exposure in the emergency department. BACKGROUND: Imaging methods that use ionizing radiation in emergency departments (EDs) have increased with advances in radiological diagnostic methods. Physician and nurse awareness of the radiation dose in the ED and the associated cancer risks to which the patients are exposed were surveyed with a questionnaire., METHODS: A total of 191 subjects in six EDs participated in this study. ED physicians and ED nurses were asked about the risks and the radiation doses of imaging methods ordered in the ED. The differences between the two groups were compared using Student's t-test for continuous variables. A Fisher's exact and Chi-squared tests were used for categorical variables., RESULTS: A total of 82 ED physicians and 109 ED nurses completed the questionnaire; 38 (46.3%) physicians and 8 (7.3%) nurses correctly answered the question about the chest X-ray radiation dose. A question about the number of chest X-rays that is equivalent to the dose of a pelvic X-ray was answered correctly by 5 (6.1%) physicians and 9 (8.3%) nurses (P = 0.571). Questions regarding abdominal computed tomography (CT), chest CT, brain CT, abdominal ultrasonography, and brain magnetic resonance imaging were answered correctly more frequently by the physician group than the nurse group (P < 0.05).

The aims of this pilot study were to evaluate the feasibility and efficacy of high-dose hypofractionated volumetric modulated arc radiotherapy (VMAT) applied to whole pelvic region radiotherapy (WPRT) with multilevel simultaneous integrated boost (MLSIB) combined with piroxicam and chemotherapy for the treatment of canine transitional cell carcinoma (TCC) of the lower urinary tract with muscle invasion TCC. Twelve dogs were enrolled, according to stage, in two groups: group 1, TCC confined to the urinary tract; group 2, TCC with metastasis. The planning target volume dose was tailored from 36 to 42 Gy in 6 fractions. All dogs were prescribed piroxicam and radiosensitizing carboplatin, and six received chemotherapy after radiotherapy. Serial follow-ups with computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging were performed. Disease control and toxicity effects were evaluated according to the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors and Veterinary Radiation Therapy Oncology Group criteria. The treatment was well tolerated, and no high-grade side effects were reported. The median overall survival times for groups 1 and 2 were 1,230 and 150 days, respectively. A considerable percentage of patients in group1 (50%) were still alive at the time of writing this paper, and a longer follow-up could enable a more accurate survival analysis. This preliminary analysis shows that VMAT applied to the WPRT with MLSIB is an effective and safe option for dogs with lower urinary TCC, although the presence of metastases worsens the prognosis.Copyright © 2021 The Japanese Society of Veterinary Science.",Excluded
1711,"Optimum fractionation in X ray treatment of C3H mouse mammary tumours. The doses required to control 50% of tumors at 150 days after irradiation were determined for eight fractionated X ray schedules. The tumors were first generation transplants from spontaneous mammary tumors in C3H/He mice. The schedules were: single doses, 5, 9 or 15 fractions given daily excluding weekends, and 2, 3, 5 or 9 fractions at the two day interval known to be optimal for reoxygenation in these tumors after a priming dose of 1,500 rads. For comparison, skin reactions on the feet of albino mice were determined, using the same fractionation schedules, in order to plot the tumor control probability (TCP) against skin reactions for corresponding schedules. Two optimum schedules were found which gave maximum local control of tumors for the lowest skin reaction: nine fractions in ten days (9F/10d) and 5F/9d. The treatments given in shorter overall times were fairly good if the two day intervals were used but were poor for 'daily' doses. Both schedules employing overall times of 18 days gave poor results. The results are discussed in relation to the time course of reoxygenation and cell proliferation. A substantial difference in TCD 50 was found between male and female mice, the females being easier to cure. (16 references.)",Excluded
18,"Preoperative chemoradiation and IOERT for unresectable or borderline resectable pancreas cancer. Background and objectives: Pre-operative chemoradiation (preop CRT) plus intraoperative electron irradiation (IOERT) has been used in the multidisciplinary treatment for patients with locally advanced unresectable or borderline resectable pancreas cancer. This review was performed to evaluate survival, relapse patterns and prognostic factors in patients treated with curative intent. Method(s): Between January 2002 and December 2010, 48 patients with locally advanced pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma received preop CRT prior to an attempt at resection and IOERT. 31/48 (65%) patients proceeded to curative-intent surgical resection. Resection status prior to preop CRT was locally unresectable (20 patients) and borderline resectable (11 patients). Preop CRT (45-50.4 Gy/25-28 Fx in 27/31) was delivered with concurrent 5FU or gemcitabine-based regimens. Subsequent gross total resection was achieved in 16 patients (R0, 11; R1, 5). IOERT was delivered in 28 patients (dose, 10-20 Gy). 16 patients also received adjuvant post-operative systemic chemotherapy. Outcomes evaluated include survival, local failure in the EBRT field (LF), central failure in the IOERT field (CF), and distant metastases. Result(s): Resection status was predictive for survival and for patterns of relapse. For patients with at least a gross total resection after preop CRT (R0/R1; n=16) vs. no resection (n=15), both median and overall survival were improved (median 23 vs. 10 months; 2-year, 40% vs. 17%; 3-year, 40% vs. 0%; P=0.002). Liver or peritoneal relapse was documented in 22/31 patients (71%); LF/CF in 5/26 (16%). Conclusion(s): Long term survival and disease control are achievable in select patients with borderline resectable or locally unresectable pancreas cancer when gross total surgical resection is achieved after preop CRT. Continued evaluation of curative-intent combined modality therapy is warranted in this high risk population, but additional strategies are needed to improve resectability and disease control.",Excluded
1712,"The effects of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation on cortical inhibition in healthy human subjects. It has been suggested that the therapeutic effects of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) are mediated through changes in cortical inhibition (CI). However, in healthy human subjects the effects of rTMS on CI have been inconsistent. Therefore, this study sought to improve on the methodological limitations of previous studies by exploring several different rTMS-stimulus conditions on inhibition in the human motor cortex. In the first experiment, 12 healthy control subjects were randomly assigned to receive regular 1, 10 or 20 Hz rTMS in a counterbalanced order with sessions separated by at least 1 week. In the second experiment, 10 of these 12 subjects received priming rTMS (600 stimuli at 6 Hz followed by 600 stimuli at 1 Hz). Cortical inhibition was indexed using short-interval intracortical inhibition (SICI) and cortical silent period (CSP). Corticospinal excitability was indexed using motor threshold and MEP amplitude. We found no significant overall change in SICI, although there was a significant correlation between changes in SICI with baseline SICI. Subjects with greater SICI at baseline tended to have reduction in SICI post-rTMS, whereas subjects with less SICI tended to have increase in SICI post-rTMS. There was also a significant lengthening of the CSP with higher stimulation frequencies compared to lower stimulation frequencies. These findings suggest that rTMS increases CI, particularly in subjects with reduced baseline inhibition, a finding consistent with the concept of homeostatic plasticity. Baseline physiological characteristics may be further explored as a method to select patients who may benefit from rTMS treatment.",Excluded
3442,"The epidemiology of vitamin D and colorectal cancer: recent findings. PURPOSE OF REVIEW: To highlight the human studies published over the past year examining the influence of vitamin D on risk of colorectal cancer., RECENT FINDINGS: Studies over the past year have added more support to the idea that higher levels of vitamin D may decrease risk of colorectal cancer. Further, typical dietary intakes such as 200-400 IU/day may be too low to exert appreciable benefits, and protection may occur with higher levels of vitamin D associated with exposure to sunshine. Recent studies also suggest a potential benefit of vitamin D on other digestive-tract cancers, and that vitamin D status at the time of diagnosis and treatment may influence survival of cancer. However, the evidence for these latter findings is based on limited data and needs to be confirmed. Higher vitamin D levels may also be associated with a higher rate of apoptosis in colorectal mucosa., SUMMARY: Recent studies add more support to a potential role of vitamin D on risk of colorectal cancer, but suggest that intakes higher than customary are required if solar ultraviolet-B exposure is low. More studies are required to determine the optimal levels and intakes of this vitamin to reduce cancer risk. Potential benefits of vitamin D on other digestive-tract cancers and on survival in patients with colorectal cancer have been suggested by recent studies, but require confirmation.",Excluded
821,"Effects of glutamine for prevention of radiation-induced esophagitis: a double-blind placebo-controlled trial. Purpose Acute radiation-induced esophagitis (ARIE) leads to treatment delays, decreased quality of life (QOL), and secondary adverse events such as weight loss. Grade 3 ARIE occurs in 15%-30% of patients undergoing radiotherapy to the esophagus, leading to disruption or discontinuation of treatment. The purpose of this study was to assess the effects of glutamine, a common nutritional supplement, on ARIE in patients with thoracic malignancies. Patients and methods This double-blind, placebo-controlled trial enrolled patients with advanced thoracic malignancies receiving concurrent chemotherapy/radiotherapy or radiotherapy alone, with radiation doses to the esophagus >=45 Gy. Patients were randomized (1:1) to receive 4 g of glutamine or glycine placebo twice daily. The primary objective was to determine whether glutamine decreases the severity of ARIE in these patients. Secondary objectives included assessment of the effects of glutamine on other measures of ARIE, weight, symptom burden measure assessed by the MD Anderson Symptom Inventory (MDASI-HN) questionnaire and the toxicity profile of glutamine. Results At the time of interim analysis, 53 patients were enrolled: 27 in the glutamine arm and 26 in the placebo arm. There was no difference in the incidence of esophagitis in the first 6 weeks of radiotherapy between the glutamine and placebo arms (74% versus 68%; P = 1.00). There were no significant differences between the two arms for time to onset of esophagitis. The duration of ARIE was shorter (6.3 versus 7.1 weeks; P = 0.54) and median weight loss was lower (0.9 kg versus 2.8 kg; p = 0.83) in the glutamine arm versus the placebo arm. The groups differ significantly in core symptom severity (2.1 vs 1.5, p <.03) but not in head and neck specific symptom severity (1.2 vs 1.1, p <.60) nor in symptom interference (2.1 vs 1.7, p <.22). There was no grade 3 or higher adverse event at least possibly related to glutamine. The study was terminated for futility following interim analysis. Conclusion Oral glutamine was not associated with significant improvement in severity of ARIE, weight loss, head and neck specific symptoms or symptom interference compared with placebo in patients with advanced thoracic malignancies receiving radiotherapy to the esophagus.

2067,"Bone healing andweight bearingmanagement in tibial diaphysis fracture unilateral external fixation. Objective: Tibial diaphysis fracture represents the commonest long bone fracture and is a major cause of professional and social absenteeism for the patient. Its management is included in the everyday practice of an Orthopaedic surgeon having various available treatment options. We wanted to evaluate the time to bone healing in tibial diaphysis fractures treated with unilateral external fixator regarding the weight bearing management. Method(s): After obtaining the hospital ethics committee approval, we retrospectively reviewed the x-rays and case notes of 54 patients who underwent an Orthofix unilateral external fixator after sustaining a tibial diaphysis closed fracture. Our primary outcome was the time to clinical and radiological bone healing and the secondary outcome of our review was the different weight bearing postoperative management. The patients were separated in 3 groups regarding the commencement of post-op weight bearing. Group 1 contained patients who started weight bearing from day 1 to day 30, in group 2 were patients who started bearing weight from day 31 until day 60 and group 3 had patients who commenced bearing weight on the affected limp after 61 days postop. Result(s): The mean time to clinical and radiological bone healing was 21 weeks after the application of the tibial diaphysis fracture unilateral external fixator. Group 1 achieved the shortest mean time to bone healing with 15 weeks. Conclusion(s): The weight bearing management regarding its early commencement could favor the time to bone healing in tibial diaphysis fracture unilateral external fixation.",Excluded
545,"Protective Effects of Magnesium Sulfate on Radiation Induced Brain Injury in Rats. OBJECTIVES: The effect of magnesium sulfate on brain tissue of SD rats irradiated by 6MeV electron was investigated., METHODS: SD rats were divided into three groups: control group, irradiation (IR group) and irradiation treated with magnesium sulfate (IR+M group). After being anesthetized, the whole brains of IR group and IR+M group were exposed to 6 MeV electron radiation. IR+M group was i.p. injected with 10% magnesium sulfate (400 mg/kg) one day before radiation and three days and five days after radiation. And on the 1st, 3rd, 7th and 14th day after radiation, SD rats were euthanatized to take brain tissue for the detection of calcium, redox status and cell apoptosis, as well as the expression of NF-kappaB and ICAM-1., RESULTS: The results indicated that magnesium treatment may alleviate the elevation of calcium and enhance redox status through increasing the activities of superoxide dimutase (SOD) and myeloperodase (MPO), and decreasing the concentration of malondialdehyde (MDA). Tunnel and immunohistochemistry assay suggested that treatment with magnesium decreased the apoptosis rate of brain cells and the expressions of caspase-3, respectively. Decline of the expression of NF-kappaB and ICAM-1 protein was observed after the treatment of magnesium., CONCLUSION: All the results demonstrated that magnesium may elicit protective effect against radiationinduced brain injury by reducing calcium overload, improving redox and inhibiting cell apoptosis. Moreover, magnesium significantly down-regulated the protein or mRNA levels of NF-kappaB and ICAM- 1. The findings may provide references for the application of magnesium in clinic for brain injury induced by radiation.

802,"AN INTERVENTIONAL CARDIOLOGY INVESTIGATION: PATIENT EXPOSURE TO RADIATION AND INTER-OPERATOR VARIABILITY IN AN IRISH SETTING. AIM: To evaluate patient radiation exposure for Diagnostic Coronary Angiography (DCA) and Percutaneous Cardiac Intervention (PCI) performed by different operators. METHODS AND RESULTS: Retrospective (n = 160) and prospective (n = 62) data for DCA (n = 179) and PCI (n = 43) examinations performed by interventional cardiologists (n = 3) using the same imaging equipment were reviewed. The operator with consistently low diagnostic reference levels (DRLs) was interviewed for their personal perceptions upon operator training. Retrospective Median [IQR] DAP was 18.8 [11.8-31.6] and 50.7 [35.3-85.6] Gy.cm2 for DCA and PCI, respectively. Prospective Median [IQR] DAP for DCA and PCI was 7.9 [5.2-10.6] and 15.9 [10.0-17.7] Gy.cm2, respectively. DRLs were within Irish and European DRLs; however, significant inter-operator variability (p < .001) was identified. CONCLUSION(S): Radiation exposure in Interventional cardiology is highly operator dependent; further research is warranted in standardization of operator training with evolving technologies.Copyright © The Author(s) 2020.

1950,"Efficacy of extracranial stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) added to standard treatment in patients with solid tumors (breast, prostate and non-small cell lung cancer) with up to 3 bone-only metastases: study protocol for a randomised phase III trial (STEREO-OS). BACKGROUND: Stereotactic Body Radiation Therapy (SBRT) is an innovative modality based on high precision planning and delivery. Cancer with bone metastases and oligometastases are associated with an intermediate or good prognosis. We assume that prolonged survival rates would be achieved if both the primary tumor and metastases are controlled by local treatment. Our purpose is to demonstrate, via a multicenter randomized phase III trial, that local treatment of metastatic sites with curative intent with SBRT associated of systemic standard of care treatment would improve the progression-free survival in patients with solid tumor (breast, prostate and non-small cell lung cancer) with up to 3 bone-only metastases compared to patients who received systemic standard of care treatment alone., METHODS: This is an open-labeled randomized superiority multicenter phase III trial. Patients with up to 3 bone-only metastases will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio.between Arm A (Experimental group): Standard care of treatment & SBRT to all bone metastases, and Arm B (Control group): standard care of treatment. For patients receiving SBRT, radiotherapy dose and fractionation depends on the site of the bone metastasis and the proximity to critical normal structures. This study aims to accrue a total of 196 patients within 4 years. The primary endpoint is progression-free survival at 1 year, and secondary endpoints include Bone progression-free survival; Local control; Cancer-specific survival; Overall survival; Toxicity; Quality of life; Pain score analysis, Cost-utility analysis; Cost-effectiveness analysis and Budget impact analysis., DISCUSSION: The expected benefit for the patient in the experimental arm is a longer expectancy of life without skeletal recurrence and the discomfort, pain and drastic reduction of mobility and handicap that the lack of local control of bone metastases eventually inflicts., TRIALS REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov NCT03143322 Registered on May 8th 2017.

1486,"Is the modified Mann Assessment of Swallowing Ability useful for assessing dysphagia in patients with mild to moderate dementia?. Dysphagia is an important causative factor of aspiration pneumonia among the elderly, particularly in patients with dementia. The modified Mann Assessment of Swallowing Ability (mMASA) is commonly used as a physician-administered screening protocol for assessing dysphagia due to its merits as a clinical test that does not involve special equipment or radiation exposure. The present study investigated whether the mMASA would reflect the dysphagia state as estimated by videofluoroscopic swallowing study (VFSS) findings and cognitive function in patients with dementia. This study included 25 subjects with mild to moderate dementia. In all subjects, swallowing function was evaluated with the mMASA and VFSS and cognitive function was evaluated using the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA), Global Deterioration Scale (GDS), and Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR) scales. The Spearman correlation and linear regression tests were conducted with the mMASA values and other tests for swallowing and cognition. The mMASA values were correlated with the Penetration-Aspiration Scale (PAS) of the VFSS as well as scores on the MMSE, MoCA, GDS, and CDR. In addition, the Judgment and Problem Solving and Community Affairs subscales of the CDR were correlated with mMASA values. The assessments of dysphagia using the mMASA were consistent with the VFSS findings and were reflected by cognitive function. Taken together, the present findings suggest that the mMASA would be useful for the routine evaluation of swallowing function in patients with mild to moderate dementia for the detection of dysphagia.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd",Excluded
3491,"Lung volumes during sustained microgravity on Spacelab SLS-1. Gravity is known to influence the mechanical behavior of the lung and chest wall. However, the effect of sustained microgravity (mu G) on lung volumes has not been reported. Pulmonary function tests were performed by four subjects before, during, and after 9 days of mu G exposure. Ground measurements were made in standing and supine postures. Tests were performed using a bag-in-box-and-flowmeter system and a respiratory mass spectrometer. Measurements included functional residual capacity (FRC), expiratory reserve volume (ERV), residual volume (RV), inspiratory and expiratory vital capacities (IVC and EVC), and tidal volume (VT). Total lung capacity (TLC) was derived from the measured EVC and RV values. With preflight standing values as a comparison, FRC was significantly reduced by 15% (approximately 500 ml) in mu G and 32% in the supine posture. ERV was reduced by 10-20% in mu G and decreased by 64% in the supine posture. RV was significantly reduced by 18% (310 ml) in mu G but did not significantly change in the supine posture compared with standing. IVC and EVC were slightly reduced during the first 24 h of mu G but returned to 1-G standing values within 72 h of mu G exposure. IVC and EVC in the supine posture were significantly reduced by 12% compared with standing. During mu G, VT decreased by 15% (approximately 90 ml), but supine VT was unchanged compared with preflight standing values. TLC decreased by approximately 8% during mu G and in the supine posture compared with preflight standing. The reductions in FRC, ERV, and RV during mu G are probably due to the cranial shift of the diaphragm, an increase in intrathoracic blood volume, and more uniform alveolar expansion.",Excluded
110,"Image quality and required radiation dose for coronary computed tomography angiography using an automatic tube potential selection technique. To investigate the image quality and the minimum required radiation dose for automatic tube potential selection (ATPS) in dual-source computed tomography (DSCT) coronary computed tomography angiography (CCTA). Three hundred twenty-five consecutive patients (153 men and 172 women) undergoing CCTA were assigned to either the ATPS group (n = 172) or the control group (n = 153); the control group underwent imaging at a constant current of 120 kV. All patients were scanned in either prospectively ECG-triggered high-pitch helical mode or sequential mode. The subjective image quality score, attenuation, image noise, signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR), volume CT dose index (CTDIvol), and effective dose (ED) were compared between the two groups with the Student t test or Mann-Whitney U test. The subjective image quality score was not significantly different between the two groups. Imaging noise and attenuation were both significantly higher in the ATPS group than in the control group (imaging noise: 25.6 +/- 7.6 versus 15.8 +/- 4.0 HU, P < 0.001; attenuation: 559.6 +/- 142.0 versus 412.5 +/- 64.3 HU, P < 0.001). SNR and CNR were significantly lower in the ATPS group than in the control group (SNR: 23.21 +/- 7.40 versus 27.71 +/- 8.25, P < 0.001; CNR: 27.81 +/- 8.44 versus 33.94 +/- 9.69, P < 0.001).

2117,"Randomized phase II study of temozolomide and radiotherapy compared with radiotherapy alone in newly diagnosed glioblastoma multiforme. Purpose: Surgery remains the standard treatment for glioma, followed by radiotherapy (RT) with or without chemotherapy. Despite multidisciplinary approaches, the median survival time for patients with glioblastoma multiform (GBM) remains at less than 1 year from initial diagnosis. Temozolomide (TMZ), an oral alkylating agent, has shown promising activity in the treatment of malignant gliomas. We conducted a multicenter randomized phase II study comparing the efficacy and safety of TMZ administered concomitantly and sequentially to RT versus RT alone in patients with newly diagnosed GBM. Patients and Methods: One hundred thirty patients with pathologically confirmed, newly diagnosed GBM were randomly assigned (110 assessable patients) to receive either TMZ 75 mg/m2/d orally, concomitantly with RT (60 Gy in 30 fractions; group A, n = 57), followed by six cycles of TMZ (150 mg/m2 on days 1 through 5 and 15 to 19 every 28 days), or RT alone (60 Gy in 30 fractions; group B, n = 53). Result(s): Median time to progression was 10.8 months in group A and 5.2 months in group B (P = .0001). One-year progression-free survival rate was 36.6% in group A and 7.7% in group B. Median overall survival (OS) time was also significantly better in group A versus group B (13.4 v 7.7 months, respectively; P < .0001), as was the 1-year OS at 56.3% v 15.7% (P < .0001), respectively. Toxicity was mainly hematologic. One patient with grade 4 myelotoxicity died as a result of sepsis. The other side effects were mild. Conclusion(s): TMZ combined with RT (concomitantly and sequentially) seems to be more effective than RT alone in patients with newly diagnosed GBM. The combined-modality treatment was well tolerated. © 2005 by American Society of Clinical Oncology.",Excluded
1887,"Validity of at home model predictions as a proxy for personal exposure to radiofrequency electromagnetic fields from mobile phone base stations. Background: Epidemiological studies on the potential health effects of RF-EMF from mobile phone base stations require efficient and accurate exposure assessment methods. Previous studies have demonstrated that the 3D geospatial model NISMap is able to rank locations by indoor and outdoor RF-EMF exposure levels. This study extends on previous work by evaluating the suitability of using NISMap to estimate indoor RF-EMF exposure levels at home as a proxy for personal exposure to RF-EMF from mobile phone base stations. Method(s): For 93 individuals in the Netherlands we measured personal exposure to RF-EMF from mobile phone base stations during a 24h period using an EME-SPY 121 exposimeter. Each individual kept a diary from which we extracted the time spent at home and in the bedroom. We used NISMap to model exposure at the home address of the participant (at bedroom height). We then compared model predictions with measurements for the 24h period, when at home, and in the bedroom by the Spearman correlation coefficient (rsp) and by calculating specificity and sensitivity using the 90th percentile of the exposure distribution as a cutpoint for high exposure. Result(s): We found a low to moderate rsp of 0.36 for the 24h period, 0.51 for measurements at home, and 0.41 for measurements in the bedroom. The specificity was high (0.9) but with a low sensitivity (0.3). Discussion(s): These results indicate that a meaningful ranking of personal RF-EMF can be achieved, even though the correlation between model predictions and 24. h personal RF-EMF measurements is lower than with at home measurements. However, the use of at home RF-EMF field predictions from mobile phone base stations in epidemiological studies leads to significant exposure misclassification that will result in a loss of statistical power to detect health effects.Copyright © 2015 Elsevier Inc.",Excluded
1770,"Analysis of equivalent uniform dose (EUD) and conventional radiation treatment parameters after primary and re-irradiation of malignant glioma. Background: Re-irradiation is a reasonable second treatment option for patients with recurrent malignant glioma (MG) after previous radio(chemo)therapy. However, only limited data is available allowing for a precise selection of patients suitable for re-treatment in regard to safety and efficacy. Method(s): Using the department database, 58 patients with two courses of percutaneous radiation were identified. Besides classical dose-volume histogram (DVH) parameters equivalent uniform dose (EUD) values were calculated for the tumor and organs at risk (OARs), retrospectively analyzed and correlated to survival outcome parameters. Cumulative EUD values were also calculated in all cases where previous OAR DVHs were available. Result(s): Median follow-up was 265 days and no relevant toxicity was observed after re-irradiation in our patient cohort during follow-up. Time interval between first and second irradiation was regularly above 6 months. As a conservative estimation of the cumulative EUD to the OARs, the EUDs of first and second irradiation were added. Median cumulative EUD to the optic chiasm was 48.8 Gy (range, 2.5-76.5 Gy), 57.4 Gy (range, 2.7-75.3 Gy) to the brainstem, 20.9/22.1 Gy (range, 0.0-68.3 Gy) to the right/left optic nerve and 73.8 Gy (range, 64.9-77.3 Gy) to the brain. No correlation between treated volume and survival was seen. Conclusion(s): This study provides retrospective estimates on cumulative doses at the OARs. EUD values are derived and may serve as reference for further studies, including planning studies where specific constraints are needed. © 2013 Niyazi et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",Excluded
3100,"Intratreatment Response Assessment With 18F-FDG PET: Correlation of Semiquantitative PET Features With Pathologic Response of Esophageal Cancer to Neoadjuvant Chemoradiotherapy. Purpose: This prospective study seeks to extract semiquantitative positron emission tomography (PET) features from 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose PET scans performed before and during neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy for esophageal cancer and to compare their accuracy in predicting histopathologic response. Methods and Materials: From 2012 to 2016, 26 patients with esophageal cancer underwent pretreatment and intratreatment PET scans during chemoradiotherapy followed by surgery. Median patient age was 63 years (interquartile range, 58-68 years); 26 patients had esophageal adenocarcinoma, and 3 had esophageal squamous cell carcinoma. The intratreatment PET scan was performed at a median of 32.4 Gy (interquartile range, 30.6-32.4 Gy). PET features of the primary site including maximum standardized uptake value (SUV), SUV mean, metabolic tumor volume, and total lesion glycolysis were extracted from the pretreatment and intratreatment PET scans. Patients were histopathologic responders if there was complete or near-complete tumor response by modified Ryan scheme. Mean values of PET features were compared between histopathologic responders and nonresponders. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) was used to compare the accuracy of PET features in predicting histopathologic response. Result(s): Eleven patients (42%) were histopathologic responders. PET features most discriminatory of histopathologic response on AUC analysis were volumetric PET features from the intratreatment PET including metabolic tumor volume based on manual contour (AUC, 0.73; 95% confidence interval, 0.52-0.93) and total lesion glycolysis based on semiautomatic 40% SUV threshold (AUC, 0.73; 95% confidence interval, 0.53-0.94).

2859,"Treatment results of alternating chemoradiotherapy followed by proton beam therapy boost combined with intra-arterial infusion chemotherapy for stage III-IVB tongue cancer. Purpose: Proton beam therapy (PBT), compared with conventional radiotherapy, can deliver high-dose radiation to a tumor, while minimizing doses delivered to surrounding normal tissues. The better dose distribution of PBT may contribute to the improvement in local control rate and reduction in late adverse events. We evaluated therapeutic results and toxicities of PBT combined with selective intra-arterial infusion chemotherapy (PBT-IACT) in patients with stage III-IVB squamous cell carcinoma of the tongue. Material(s) and Method(s): After 2 systemic chemotherapy courses and whole-neck irradiation (36 Gy in 20 fractions), we administered concurrent chemoradiotherapy comprising PBT for the primary tumor [28.6-33 Gy(RBE) in 13-15 fractions] and for the metastatic neck lymph node [33-39.6 Gy(RBE) in 15-18 fractions] with weekly retrograde intra-arterial chemotherapy by continuous infusion of cisplatin with sodium thiosulfate. Result(s): Between February 2009 and September 2012, 33 patients were enrolled. The median follow-up duration was 43 months. The 3-year overall survival, progression-free survival, local control rate, and regional control rate for the neck were 87.0, 74.1, 86.6, and 83.9 %, respectively. Major acute toxicities >grade 3 included mucositis in 26 cases (79 %), neutropenia in 17 cases (51 %), and dermatitis in 11 cases (33 %). Late grade 2 osteoradionecrosis was observed in 1 case (3 %). Conclusion(s): PBT-IACT for stage III-IVB tongue cancer has an acceptable toxicity profile and showed good treatment results. This protocol should be considered as a treatment option for locally advanced tongue cancer.Copyright © 2015, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.",Excluded
84,"Novel X-Ray Imaging Technology Allows Substantial Patient Radiation Reduction without Image Quality Impairment in Repetitive Transarterial Chemoembolization for Hepatocellular Carcinoma. RATIONALE AND OBJECTIVES: To assess patient radiation dose reduction and the image quality of a new X-ray imaging technology during repetitive transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC)., METHODS: Fifty HCC patients (36 men; 57 +/- 11 years) undergoing repetitive TACE were first randomly assigned to receive a TACE treatment on a reference X-ray system or a low-dose system with advanced real-time image processing. The alternate system was used for a repeated TACE (treatment interval, 0.5-6 months). Fluoroscopy time, number of digital subtraction angiography (DSA), air kerma (AK), and dose area product (DAP) were compared between the two systems and between the two repetitive TACE. Three interventional radiologists independently rated the image quality in blinded offline readings., RESULTS: Fluoroscopy time (8.7 +/- 5.9 minutes vs. 8.7 +/- 7.9 minutes, P = .981), numbers of DSA runs (6 +/- 4 vs. 6 +/- 4, P = .735), and exposure images (173 +/- 86 vs. 168 +/- 91, P = .916) were equivalent between the two systems. No statistical difference in X-ray usage was found between repeated treatments. Compared to the reference system, the technology significantly reduced AK and DAP by 48.6% (0.17 +/- 0.13 Gy vs. 0.41 +/- 0.36 Gy, P < .0001) and 50.3% (77.3 +/- 55.2 Gy cm(2) vs. 195.0 +/- 155.5 Gy cm(2), P < .0001), respectively. Image quality was rated comparable between the new system and the reference, with average scores of 3.9 +/- 0.3 versus 4.4 +/- 0.3 in fluoroscopy and 4.5 +/- 0.2 versus 4.3 +/- 0.3 in DSA., CONCLUSIONS: Patient radiation exposure can be substantially reduced by a factor of approximately two with the novel X-ray imaging technology while maintaining image quality.

2330,"Ultrasonography in assessing suspected bone fractures: a cross-sectional survey amongst German general practitioners. BACKGROUND: Over the last two decades, ultrasonography (US) has been shown to be an accurate tool for the diagnosis of suspected bone fractures; however, the integration of this application of US into routine care and outpatient settings needs to be explored. In this study, we surveyed German general practitioners (GPs) to assess their knowledge, attitudes, and utilization of US for the diagnosis of suspected fractures.
METHODS: Notification of the study, a self-designed questionnaire, and a reminder were mailed to 600 randomly selected GPs in Saxony and Saxony-Anhalt.
RESULTS: The response rate was 47.7% (n = 286), and respondents did not differ from the population of all GPs in respect to sex and practice type. Among GPs surveyed, 48.6% used an US device in their practice. On average, GPs diagnosed six patients with suspected fractures per month, yet only 39.3% knew about the possibility of ultrasonographic fracture diagnosis, and only 4.3% of GPs using US applied it for this purpose. Among participants, 71.9% believed that US is inferior to conventional X-rays for the diagnosis of bony injuries. Users of US were better informed of and more commonly used US for fracture diagnosis compared to non-users.
CONCLUSION: The need to rule out possible fractures frequently arises in general practice, and US devices are broadly available. Further efforts are needed to improve the knowledge and attitudes of GPs regarding the accuracy of US for fracture diagnosis. Multicenter controlled trials could explore the safety, usefulness, and effectiveness of this still seldom used diagnostic approach for suspected fractures.",Excluded

The purpose of this study is to assess the successful incorporation of cages in patients after cervical or lumbar intercorporal fusion with positron-emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT). Twenty patients (14 female and 6 male; mean age 58 years, age range 38-73 years) with 30 cervical (n = 13) or lumbar (n = 17) intercorporal fusions were prospectively enrolled in this study. Time interval between last intercorporal intervention and PET/CT ranged from 2 to 116 months (mean 63; median 77 months). IRB approval was obtained for all patients, and written informed consent was obtained from all patients. About 30 min prior to PET/CT scanning, 97-217 MBq (mean 161 MBq) 18F-fluoride were administered intravenously. Patients were imaged in supine position on a combined PET/CT system (Discovery RX/STE, 16/64 slice CT, GE Healthcare). 3D-PET emission data were acquired for 1.5 and 2 min/bed position, respectively, and reconstructed by a fully 3D iterative algorithm (VUE Point HD) using low-dose CT data for attenuation correction. A dedicated diagnostic thin-slice CT was optionally acquired covering the fused region. Areas of increased 18F-fluoride uptake around cages were determined by one double-board certified radiologist/nuclear physician and one board certified radiologist in consensus. In 12/20 (60%) patients, increased 18F-fluoride uptake around cages was observed. Of the 30 intercorporal fusions, 15 (50%) showed increased 18F-fluoride uptake. Median time between intervention and PET/CT examination in cages with increased uptake was 37 months (2-116 months), median time between intervention and PET/CT examination in those cages without increased uptake was 91 months (19-112 months), p (Wilcoxon) = 0.01 (one-sided). 14/29 (48%) cages with a time interval > 1 year between intervention and PET/CT scan showed an increased uptake. In conclusion, PET/CT frequently shows increased 18F-fluoride uptake in cervical and lumbar cages older than 1 year (up to almost 8 years in cervical cages and 10 years in lumbar cages) possibly indicating unsuccessful fusion due to increased stress/microinstability. © Springer-Verlag 2010.",Excluded
3395,"Multiple shifts to different pollinators fuelled rapid diversification in sexually deceptive Ophrys orchids. Episodes of rapid speciation provide unique insights into evolutionary processes underlying species radiations and patterns of biodiversity. Here we investigated the radiation of sexually deceptive bee orchids (Ophrys). Based on a time-calibrated phylogeny and by means of ancestral character reconstruction and divergence time estimation, we estimated the tempo and mode of this radiation within a state-dependent evolutionary framework. It appears that, in the Pleistocene, the evolution of Ophrys was marked by episodes of rapid diversification coinciding with shifts to different pollinator types: from wasps to Eucera bees to Andrena and other bees. An abrupt increase in net diversification rate was detected in three clades. Among these, two phylogenetically distant lineages switched from Eucera to Andrena and other bees in a parallel fashion and at about the same time in their evolutionary history. Lack of early radiation associated with the evolution of the key innovation of sexual deception suggests that Ophrys diversification was mainly driven by subsequent ecological opportunities provided by the exploitation of novel pollinator groups, encompassing many bee species slightly differing in their sex pheromone communication systems, and by spatiotemporal fluctuations in the pollinator mosaic.",Excluded
3623,"Clinical characteristics of patients with intradialytic hypertension. Introduction and Aims: Intradialytic hypertension with a prevalence of 15% among hemodialysis patients is with unknown pathophysiology, demographic, laboratory and clinical characteristic of patients, and it's influence on long - lasting clinical effects (cardiovascular morbidity and mortality, rate of hospitalization). So, the aim of the study is to present the clinical, laboratory and demographic characteristics of patients with intradialytic hypertension in our dialysis center. Method(s): Of total 110 hemodialysis patients, 17 patients (15,45%) were intradialytic hypertensive - started at a systolic pressure greater than 140 mm Hg or had an increase in systolic pressure more than 10 mm Hg during the session, and 17 patients were normotensive or had a drop in blood pressure during the dialysis. HD were performed 3 times per week with a duration of 4-5 hours, on machines with controlled ultrafiltration and high flux syntetic membrane ( polyetersulfon) sterilized with gamma rays. It was used dialysate with standard electrolytes content (Na+ 138 mmol/L, K+ 2,0 mmol/L, Ca++ 1,5 mmol/L, Mg +1,0 mmol/L, CH3COO- 3,0 mmol/L, Cl -110 mmol/l, HCO3- 35 mmol/L). Analysed demographic and clinical characteristics were: gender, age, BMI, dialysis vintage, vascular acces, cardiovascular comorbidity (cardiomyopathy, ischemic cardiac disease, peripheral artery disease, heart valve disease), number and type of antihypertensive drugs, a weekly dose of erythropoesis - stimulating agent, standard monthly, three and six months laboratory analyzes, and sp Kt/V and PCR. Statistical analysis was performed with SPSS 17.0. Result(s): In the both groups were more men (IDH group 88,23%, control group 64,07%). IDH group was older (59,00+/- 7,64 versus 49.00+/- 13,91, p= 0,314) and with lower BMI (p = 0,246) compared to control group. Significantly lower serum sodium and higher sodium gradient had IDH patients (135,75+/-2,03 versus 137,33 +/-1,97, p= 0,042; 2,25+/-1,98 versus 0,66+/-1,44, p=0,0267, respestively). In other laboratory analysis there was no statistically significant differences between two groups. IDH group had significantly higher interdialysis weight gain and less effective ultrafiltration individually at each dialysis session compared to the control group (2,23 +/-0,866 versus 2,37+/-0,69, p=0,011; 3,87+/-1,26 versus 3,56+/-1.18, p=0,025, respectively). The systolic and mean arterial pressure after the HD were statistically higher in IDH group, receiving multiple antihypertensive drugs and have more cardiovascular diseases compared to patients without intradialytic hypertension. Conclusion(s): Older, lower BMI, border hyponatremia, higher sodium gradient, smaller ultrafiltration rate, higher cardiovascular morbidity and more use of antihypertensive drugs are the clinical characteristics of patients with intradialytic hypertension.",Excluded
1544,"Early Stage Extranodal Follicular Lymphoma: Characteristics, Management, and Outcomes. Introduction: Extranodal follicular lymphoma (E-FL) is a rare entity that has distinct characteristics and outcomes compared with nodal follicular lymphoma. Patients and Methods: This cohort comprised 37 patients with stages I/II E-FL, diagnosed from 2003 to 2013. Outcomes included progression-free survival (PFS), and overall survival (OS). Survival outcomes were calculated using Kaplan-Meier methods. Result(s): Median age was 60 years (range, 37-84 years). Disease was stage I in 29 (78.4%). The Follicular Lymphoma International Prognostic Index score was 0 to 1 in 31 (83.8%), 2 in 2 (5.4%), 3 in 1 (2.7%), and missing in 3 (8.1%). Sites of involvement included the gastrointestinal (GI) tract in 22 (59.5%), and non-GI sites in 15 (40.5%). Initial management consisted of chemotherapy (CHT) alone in 21 (56.8%), radiation therapy (RT) alone in 2 patients (5.4%), RT and rituximab in 1 (2.7%), CHT and RT in 7 (18.9%), and observation in 6 (16.2%). RT was to a median dose of 30.6 Gy (range, 23.4-44.0 Gy). At a median follow-up of 69 months (range, 8-157 months), 5-year PFS and OS were 70.4% and 94.4%, respectively. Although the 5-year PFS of those observed was worse than for those who received therapy (33.3% vs. 77.6%; P = .011), that did not translate into an OS difference. Patients who received RT as part of upfront management had a 100% local control (LC) rate and a trend toward improved 5-year PFS (90% vs. 62.2%; P = .067). Conclusion(s): Early stage E-FL is an indolent disease and is associated with excellent OS. Treatment strategies should be individualized with RT prioritized when LC is a significant goal., This was a retrospective study to investigate management and outcomes of early stage extranodal follicular lymphoma patients because there is limited literature on this subgroup of patients. Although this is an indolent disease, we found a significant improvement in recurrence-free survival rates with treatment compared with observation alone. Patients who received radiation therapy as part of upfront treatment had excellent local control. The results of this study show that treatment should be individualized, and radiation can be a great option in patients for whom local control is essential.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.",Excluded

INTRODUCTION: For the induction therapy of non-small-cell lung cancer, we need to look for a regimen which produces a reliable high response rate with a low treatment related morbidity and mortality., METHODS: Patients in clinical stages IB, IIA and B, IIIA and B received a course of therapy with 20Gy of radiation in 2 weeks. This was followed by two courses of chemotherapy consisting of paclitaxel 180mg/m(2), cisplatin 45mg/m(2), and ifosfamide 1000mg/m(2). Two to 3 weeks after chemotherapy, the patients were re-evaluated and, if suitable, underwent surgical therapy., RESULTS: A total of 35 patients were entered into the study. The overall response rate was 82.86% (95% confidence interval, 66.35-94.5%). Complete response (CR) was 20% (95% confidence interval, 8.44-36.94%). Twenty-five patients had surgical resection. Subsequently 18 patients received completion radiotherapy of additional 45Gy. The median follow up is 30 months. In 12 patients with stages IB, IIA and B, the median survival was 61 months, and 5-year survival was 55%. In 23 patients with stages IIIA and B, the median survival was 26 months, and 5-year survival was 9.5%. There was 1 patient with Grade 4 and 13 patients with Grade 3 leukopenia, and half of them received granulocyte colony stimulating factor. By the completion radiotherapy, 6 out of 18 patients had less than Grade 2 esophagitis. Five patients had Grade 2 radiation pneumonitis and one Grade 5 (one mortality). There was no postoperative death. The survival results were comparable to those reported recently by others, however the regimen produced a high response rate with low treatment related morbidity/mortality., CONCLUSION: It is a suitable regimen for induction therapy to include earlier stage resectable non-small-cell lung cancers.",Excluded
784,"Diagnostic capability and radiation dose of cone beam CT dacryocystography in different scanning fields of view in healthy volunteers. OBJECTIVES: Cone beam CT dacryocystography (CBCT-DCG) is a new imaging technique for assessing the lacrimal drainage system (LDS). The purpose of this pilot study is to compare the diagnostic capability and radiation dose of CBCT-DCG in different scanning fields of view (FOV) to evaluate the possibilities of the reduction of radiation dose. METHOD(S): Fifteen healthy volunteers underwent CBCT-DCG in an upright position. The first five subjects were scanned using the scanning FOV of 11x10 cm (Group A), then 8x8 cm (Group B), and the last five subjects 5x5.5 cm (Group C). The image quality and diagnostic validity of different groups were evaluated by two experienced otolaryngologists. The effective dose of each group was calculated and compared. RESULT(S): All images showed good delineation of the LDS and its surrounding structures. With regard to the image quality and diagnostic validity, no differences were found among different groups. Compared with Group A, the effective radiation dose for Group B (38.40 muSv) was 38.54% lower and that for Group C (17.12 muSv) was 72.60% lower. CONCLUSION(S): A substantial reduction of the effective dose for CBCT-DCG in healthy volunteer by decreasing FOV is possible without compromising the diagnostic capability. CBCT-DCG is a potential valid first-line imaging test for the evaluation of LDS, and it permits functional assessment of lacrimal drainage.",Excluded

SMC1 (Structural Maintenance of Chromosomes protein 1), well known as one of the SMC superfamily members, has been explored to function in many activities including chromosome dynamics, cell cycle checkpoint, DNA damage repair and genome stability. Upon being properly assembled as part of cohesin, SMC1 can be phosphorylated by ATM and mediate downstream DNA damage repair after ionizing irradiation. Abnormal gene expression or mutation of SMC1 can cause defect in the DNA damage repair pathway, which has been strongly associated with tumorigenesis.

620,"Three-stage Gamma Knife treatment for metastatic brain tumors larger than 10 cm3: A 2-institute study including re-analyses of earlier results using competing risk analysis. OBJECTIVE The results of 3-stage Gamma Knife treatment (3-st-GK-Tx) for relatively large brain metastases have previously been reported for a series of patients in Chiba, Japan (referred to in this study as the C-series). In the current study, the authors reappraised, using a competing risk analysis, the efficacy and safety of 3-st-GK-Tx by comparing their experience with that of the C-series. METHODS This was a retrospective cohort study. Among 1767 patients undergoing GK radiosurgery for brain metastases at Mito Gamma House during the 2005-2015 period, 78 (34 female, 44 male; mean age 65 years, range 35-86 years) whose largest tumor was > 10 cm3, treated with 3-st-GK-Tx, were studied (referred to in this study as the M-series). The target volumes were covered with a 50% isodose gradient and irradiated with a peripheral dose of 10 Gy at each procedure. The interval between procedures was 2 weeks. Because competing risk analysis had not been employed in the published C-series, the authors reanalyzed the previously published data using this method. RESULTS The overall median survival time after 3-st-GK-Tx was 8.3 months (95% CI 5.6-12.0 months) in the M-series and 8.6 months (95% CI 5.5-10.6 months) in the C-series (p = 0.41). Actuarial survival rates at the 6th and 12th post-3-st-GK-Tx months were, respectively, 55.1% and 35.2% in the M-series and 62.5% and 26.4% in the C-series (HR 1.175, 95% CI 0.790-1.728, p = 0.42). Cumulative incidences at the 12th post-3-st-GK-Tx, determined by competing risk analyses, of neurological deterioration (14.2% in C-series vs 12.8% in M-series), neurological death (7.2% vs 7.7%), local recurrence (4.8% vs 6.2%), repeat SRS (25.9% vs 18.0%), and SRS-related complications (2.3% vs 5.1%) did not differ significantly between the 2 series. CONCLUSIONS There were no significant differences in post-3-st-GK-Tx results between the 2 series in terms of overall survival times, neurological death, maintained neurological status, local control, repeat SRS, and SRS-related complications.

329,"High pretreatment plasma D-dimer levels are associated with shorter overall survival in patients with small cell lung cancer. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the relationship between pretreatment plasma D-dimer levels and survival in Chinese patients with small cell lung cancer (SCLC)., METHODS: This retrospective study enrolled 82 patients with SCLC treated at Beijing Chaoyang Hospital, Capital Medical University, from January 2012 to January 2015. All patients were followed up. Associations between pretreatment plasma D-dimer levels measured by immunoturbidimetric assay and clinical outcomes were analyzed by Kaplan-Meier and multivariate analyses, using a cut-off level of 0.55 mg/L fibrinogen equivalent units (FEU)., RESULTS: Median progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) were significantly higher in patients with low D-dimer levels (<=0.55 mg/L FEU; 8.0 and 17.0 months, respectively) compared with patients with high levels (>0.55 mg/L FEU; 5.0 and 9.0 months, respectively). Plasma D-dimer levels, Karnofsky performance status, N stage, TNM stage, treatment, and neuron-specific enolase (NSE) levels were significantly associated with PFS, while D-dimer levels, N stage, TNM stage, and treatment were significantly associated with OS. Multivariate analysis revealed that TNM stage, treatment, and NSE levels were independently associated with PFS, while D-dimer levels and treatment were independently associated with OS., CONCLUSIONS: Pretreatment plasma D-dimer levels were independently associated with OS in patients with SCLC.",Excluded
264,"Effectiveness of gene expression profiling for response prediction of rectal cancer to preoperative radiotherapy. Background: Our aim was to determine whether the expression levels of specific genes could predict clinical radiosensitivity in human colorectal cancer. Method(s): Radioresistant colorectal cancer cell lines were established by repeated X-ray exposure (total, 100 Gy), and the gene expressions of the parent and radioresistant cell lines were compared in a microarray analysis. To verify the microarray data, we carried out a reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction analysis of identified genes in clinical samples from 30 irradiated rectal cancer patients. Result(s): A comparison of the intensity data for the parent and three radioresistant cell lines revealed 17 upregulated and 142 downregulated genes in all radioresistant cell lines. Next, we focused on two upregulated genes, PTMA (prothymosin alpha) and EIF5a2 (eukaryotic translation initiation factor 5A), in the radioresistant cell lines. In clinical samples, the expression of PTMA was significantly higher in the minor effect group than in the major effect group (P = 0.004), but there were no significant differences in EIF5a2 expression between the two groups. Conclusion(s): We identified radiation-related genes in colorectal cancer and demonstrated that PTMA may play an important role in radiosensitivity. Our findings suggest that PTMA may be a novel marker for predicting the effectiveness of radiotherapy in clinical cases. © Springer-Verlag Tokyo 2007.",Excluded

PURPOSE: Comparison of quality of life (QoL) and side effects in a randomized trial for early hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBOT) after radiotherapy (RT)., METHODS AND MATERIALS: From 2006, 19 patients with tumor originating from the tonsillar fossa and/or soft palate (15), base of tongue (1), and nasopharynx (3) were randomized to receive HBOT or not. HBOT consisted of 30 sessions at 2.5 ATA (15 msw) with oxygen breathing for 90 min daily, 5 days per week, applied shortly after the RT treatment was completed. As of 2005, all patients received validated questionnaires (i.e., the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer [EORTC] QLQ-C30, EORTC QLQ Head and Neck Cancer Module (H&N35), Performance Status Scale): before treatment; at the start of RT treatment; after 46 Gy; at the end of RT treatment; and 2, 4, and 6 weeks and 3, 6, 12, and 18 months after follow-up., RESULTS: On all QoL items, better scores were obtained in patients treated with hyperbaric oxygen.

2586,"Effect of selective inhibitors of inflammation on oral mucositis: preclinical studies. OBJECTIVE: Oral mucositis is a severe, dose-limiting side effect of radio(chemo)therapy for head and neck tumors. The epithelial radiation response (ulceration) is accompanied by inflammatory changes. Their interaction with the epithelial processes remains unclear. The present study was initiated to determine the effect of inhibition of TNF-alpha or COX-2 on the epithelial radiation response in the mouse tongue model., METHODS: Daily fractionated irradiation was given with 5 x 3 Gy/week over one (days 0-4) or two weeks (days 0-4, 7-11). Each protocol was terminated by graded test doses (5 dose groups, 10 animals each) to a defined area of the lower tongue surface to generate full dose-effect curves for mucosal ulceration. A TNF-alpha inhibiting antibody (Infliximab) or a COX-2 inhibitor (Celecoxib) was administered., RESULTS: No effect of Infliximab or Celecoxib was found in any of the protocols. Isoeffective doses for ulcer induction were unchanged. Also, the time course of the response was largely unaffected., CONCLUSIONS: Inhibition of TNF-alpha or COX-2, two dominating inflammatory pathways, did not result in modulation of the response of oral epithelium during fractionated irradiation. This suggests that the inflammatory changes mediated through TNF-alpha or COX-2 are not relevant for the epithelial radiation response of oral mucosa.",Excluded
1178,"In vitro effects of simulated microgravity on Sertoli cell function. With the advent of space flights questions concerning the effects of microgravity (0G) on human reproductive physiology have received great attention. The aim of this study was to evaluate the influence of 0G on Sertoli cells. A Sertoli cell line from mouse testis (42GPA9) was analyzed for cytoskeletal and Sex Hormone Binding Globilin (SHBG) changes by immunohistochemistry, for antioxidant content by RT-PCR and for culture medium lactate concentrations by protein chemistry. Cells were cultured for 6, 24 and 48 h on a three-dimensional Random Positioning Machine (3D-RPM); static controls (1G) were positioned on the supporting frame. At the end of each experiment, cultured cells were either fixed in paraformaldehyde or lysed and RNA-extracted or used for culture medium lactate measurements as needed. At 0G, Sertoli cytoskeleton became disorganized, microtubules fragmented and SHBG undetectable already after 24 h, with alterations worsening by 48 h. It was evident that various antioxidant systems appreciably increased during the first 24 h but significantly decreased at 48 h. No changes occurred in the 1G samples. Initially, 0G seemed to disturb antioxidant protection strategies allowing the testes to support sperm production, thus generating an aging-like state of oxidative stress. Lactate production at 0G slightly decreased after 24 h. Further experiments are needed in space to investigate upon steroidogenesis and germ cell differentiation within the testis, to rule out male infertility as a possible consequence, which could be a problem, as life expectancy increases. 2010 COSPAR.

Purpose/Objective(s): Patients with oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) have been shown to lose more weight compared to patients with tumors at other sub-sites during external beam radiation therapy (EBRT). Furthermore, severe malnutrition before EBRT initiation may affect treatment outcome. This study investigated the association of factors, including nutritional status before treatment initiation, with gross tumor volume shrinkage rates (GTVSRs) during EBRT in OSCC patients. Materials/Methods: This retrospective study included 65 consecutive OSCC patients [55 males, 10 females, median age 65 years (38e82)] with no prior OSCC surgery. They were treated with definitive EBRT between November 2006 and December 2014. Tumors were staged as T1 (n = 7, 11%), T2 (n = 21, 32%), T3 (n = 18, 28%), T4a (n = 15, 23%), or T4b (n=4, 6%); N0 (n=9, 14%), N1 (n=3, 5%), N2a (n=3, 5%), N2b (n Z 26, 40%), N2c (n = 18, 27%), or N3 (n = 6, 9%); and as M0 (n = 64, 98%) or M1 (n = 1, 2%). Percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) was performed in 48 patients (74%) before EBRT initiation. Total radiation doses were as follows: 70 Gy, n = 62 (94%) and 71, 66, and 64 Gy, n = 1 each (2%). Computed tomography (CT) images were acquired prior to EBRT initiation and at 3e5 weeks after EBRT initiation for re-planning. Cervical body volume (CBV) was evaluated before EBRT initiation using initial CT images. GTVSRs were calculated based on initial and re-planning CT images. Four patients (6%) received induction chemotherapy (IC). Fifty-seven patients (88%) received concurrent chemotherapy (CC) using following regimen: TPF [docetaxel (DTX), cisplatin (CDDP), and 5-fluorouracil] (n = 29, 44%); another CDDP-based menu (n = 22, 34%); the other DTX-based menu (n = 3, 5%); and cetuximab (n = 3, 5%).

2294,"Irradiated male tsetse from a 40-year-old colony are still competitive in a Riparian forest in Burkina Faso. BACKGROUND: Tsetse flies are the cyclical vectors of African trypanosomosis that constitute a major constraint to development in Africa. Their control is an important component of the integrated management of these diseases, and among the techniques available, the sterile insect technique (SIT) is the sole that is efficient at low densities. The government of Burkina Faso has embarked on a tsetse eradication programme in the framework of the PATTEC, where SIT is an important component. The project plans to use flies from a Glossina palpalis gambiensis colony that has been maintained for about 40 years at the Centre International de Recherche-Developpement sur l'Elevage en zone Subhumide (CIRDES). It was thus necessary to test the competitiveness of the sterile males originating from this colony., METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: During the period January-February 2010, 16,000 sterile male G. p. gambiensis were released along a tributary of the Mouhoun river. The study revealed that with a mean sterile to wild male ratio of 1.16 (s.d. 0.38), the abortion rate of the wild female flies was significantly higher than before (p = 0.026) and after (p = 0.019) the release period. The estimated competitiveness of the sterile males (Fried index) was 0.07 (s.d. 0.02), indicating that a sterile to wild male ratio of 14.4 would be necessary to obtain nearly complete induced sterility in the female population. The aggregation patterns of sterile and wild male flies were similar. The survival rate of the released sterile male flies was similar to that observed in 1983-1985 for the same colony., CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: We conclude that gamma sterilised male G. p. gambiensis derived from the CIRDES colony have a competitiveness that is comparable to their competitiveness obtained 35 years ago and can still be used for an area-wide integrated pest management campaign with a sterile insect component in Burkina Faso.",Excluded

Aims Multidetector computed tomography coronary angiography (CTA) has emerged as a feasible imaging modality for non-invasive assessment of coronary artery disease (CAD). Recently, 320-row CTA systems were introduced, with 16 cm anatomical coverage, allowing image acquisition of the entire heart within a single heart beat. The aim of the present study was to assess the diagnostic accuracy of 320-row CTA in patients with known or suspected CAD. Methods and resultsA total of 64 patients (34 male, mean age 61 +/- 16 years) underwent CTA and invasive coronary angiography. All CTA scans were evaluated for the presence of obstructive coronary stenosis by a blinded expert, and results were compared with quantitative coronary angiography. Four patients were excluded from initial analysis due to non-diagnostic image quality. Sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values to detect >=50 luminal narrowing on a patient basis were 100, 88, 92, and 100, respectively. Moreover, sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values to detect >=70 luminal narrowing on a patient basis were 94, 95, 88, and 98, respectively. With inclusion of non-diagnostic imaging studies, sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values to detect >=50 luminal narrowing on a patient basis were 100, 81, 88, and 100, respectively.

1389,"Effects of variable power on tissue ablation dynamics during magnetic resonance-guided laser-induced thermal therapy with the Visualase system. Purpose: Magnetic resonance-guided laser-induced thermal therapy (MRgLITT) is a minimally invasive procedure used to treat various intracranial pathologies. This study investigated the effects of variable power on maximal estimated thermal damage during ablation and duration required to reach maximal ablation. Materials/Methods: All ablations were performed using the Visualase Thermal Therapy System (Medtronic Inc., Minneapolis, Minnesota), which uses a 980 nm diffusing tip diode laser. Cases were stratified into low, medium and high power. Maximal thermal damage estimate (TDEmax) achieved in a single plane and time to reach maximal damage (ttdemax) were measured and compared between groups using a 2x3 Fixed Factor Analysis of Covariance. Ablation area change for cases in which an initial thermal dose was followed by a subsequent dose, with increased power, was also assessed. Result(s): We used real-time ablation data from 93 patients across various intracranial pathologies. ttdemax (mean +/- SEM) decreased linearly as power increased (low: 139.2 +/- 10.4 s, medium: 127.5 +/- 4.3 s, high: 103.7 +/- 5.8 s). In cases where a second thermal dose was delivered at higher power, the TDE expanded an average of 51.4 mm2 beyond the initial TDE generated by the first ablation, with the second ablation approaching TDEmax at a higher rate than the initial ablation. Conclusion(s): Increased power results in a larger TDEmax and an increased ablation rate. In cases where an initial thermal dose does not fully ablate the target lesion, a second ablation at higher power can increase the area of ablation with an increased ablation rate.Copyright © 2017, © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",Excluded
2683,"Fat Grafting as a Novel Treatment for Xerostomia. PURPOSE: Within the context of xerostomia, there is evidence that adipose-derived stem cells (ASCs) can differentiate into salivary gland cells in the appropriate environment. The purpose of this study was to preliminarily investigate whether fat grafting as practiced in the United States would be an effective treatment for xerostomia. METHOD(S): Patients were selected for the study if they were seeking treatment for xerostomia after radiation treatment to the head and neck for cancer treatment. Fat grafting was performed in bilateral parotid and submandibular glands. Visual Analog Scale (VAS) of xerostomia was used both preoperatively and postoperatively to assess the effect upon xerostomia symptoms. RESULT(S): Nine patients were included in this study. All patients had complaints of long-standing xerostomia. The average preoperative VAS score was 9.1. All patients tolerated all rounds of fat grafting with no complications. The average postoperative VAS score was 6.0. Compared to preoperative scores, all patients had improvement in VAS scores. The decrease in average VAS score postoperatively (9.1 versus 6.0) was statistically significant (P = 0.007). CONCLUSION(S): Our study showed that there was improvement in xerostomia symptoms with autologous fat transfer alone. This is a novel finding for fat grafting demonstrating regenerative potential. There has been extensive basic research that has shown that adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cells can have a protective and restorative role after salivary gland radiation damage. Our case series is the first report of fat grafting having a similar reported outcome. Level of Evidence: 4.Copyright © 2020 by Mutaz B. Habal, MD.",Excluded

We investigated the clinical features of GI toxicity after CRT in patients with LAPC and examined the effect of GI hemorrhage on survival. Method(s): Patients enrolled in this study had received CRT for pathologically proven LAPC. Their medical records were retrospectively reviewed. Result(s): A total of 156 patients with LAPC (median age, 65 years; range, 39 to 90 years) who received treatment between August 2005 and March 2009 were included in this study. The most common GI toxicities were ulcer formation (25.6%) and hemorrhage (25.6%), and the most common grade 3 to grade 5 GI toxicity was hemorrhage (65%). The origins of GI hemorrhage were gastric ulcer (37.5%), duodenal ulcer (37.5%), and radiation gastritis (15.0%). The independent risk factor for GI hemorrhage was tumor location in the pancreatic body. The median overall survival of the patients with a GI hemorrhage was 13.8 months (range, 2.8 to 50.8 months) and was not significantly different from that of patients without GI hemorrhage. Conclusion(s): GI hemorrhage was common in patients with LAPC after CRT. Although GI hemorrhage was controlled with endoscopic hemostasis, preventive measures should be investigated to reduce needless suffering.",Excluded
354,"Open versus Percutaneous Stabilization of Thoracolumbar Spine Fractures: A Short-Term Functional and Radiological Follow-up. PURPOSE OF THE STUDY: A prospective cohort study evaluates the functional and radiological outcome of thoracolumbar spine fractures treated either with open or percutaneous dorsal instrumentation. In recent years, several studies advocate percutaneous stabilization of spinal fractures in patients without neurological deficits. However, it is still debated whether percutaneous stabilization is superior to open dorsal instrumentation in spinal trauma., MATERIAL AND METHODS: This study was performed between 2010 and 2012 at a Level 1 trauma center. Patients treated either with an open or a percutaneous dorsal instrumentation for traumatic fractures of the thoracolumbar spine (T11 to L2) were included. Fracture morphology, screw positioning and clinical parameters were analyzed. Standardized questionnaires (VAS-spine-score; Oswestry-disability-score; SF-36) and follow up radiographs were performed., RESULTS: Overall 72 patients (29 percutaneous; 43 open) could be included. The surgical and the early postsurgical course were similar between both groups. Furthermore the operative approach had no influence on the functional and radiological outcome one year after surgery, but the questionnaires showed moderate impairments within both groups. Also both groups showed a significant loss of reduction after the first postoperative month (p < 0.01). Within the open group a significantly higher amount of fracture reduction (p < 0.01) and a significantly reduced intraoperative radiation exposure was seen (open 105.9 sec.; percutaneous 143.1 sec; p < 0.05); whereas the percutaneous approach was associated with significantly reduced intraoperative blood loss (open 2.2 g/dl; percutaneous 1.2 g/dl; p < 0.001)., CONCLUSION: The functional and the radiological outcome of both groups was comparable one year after trauma. Minor advantages of the percutaneous system was less blood loss, whereas the open approach was associated with a significantly higher amount of initial reduction and significantly less intraoperative radiation exposure. Independent from the type of posterior fixation loss of reduction was already significant in the early postoperative course.",Excluded
1060,"Pharmacological and toxicological evaluation of 2-fluoro-3-(2(S)-azetidinylmethoxy)pyridine (2-F-A-85380), a ligand for imaging cerebral nicotinic acetylcholine receptors with positron emission tomography. 2-[(18)F]fluoro-3-(2(S)-azetidinylmethoxy)pyridine (2-[(18)F]F-A-85380), a positron emission tomography (PET) radioligand for neuronal alpha4beta2(*) nicotinic acetylcholine receptors, was evaluated for its pharmacology and safety. In the Ames test for mutagenicity, 2-F-A-85380 was without effect in five bacterial strains. No evidence of gross pathology or histopathological changes occurred in either 2-day acute (0.4-4000 nmol/kg i.v.) or 14-day expanded acute (40-4000 nmol/kg i.v.) toxicity studies in mice. Similarly, hematology and serum chemistry values in rhesus monkeys administered 60 nmol/kg i.v. were not affected over 14 days. Like nicotine, 2-F-A-85380 produced convulsions in mice at very high doses. The ED(50) value of 2-F-A-85380 for eliciting tonic-clonic convulsions (5.0 micromol/kg i.v.) was nearly 4 times greater than that of nicotine (ED(50) = 1.4 micromol/kg i.v.). Lower doses of 2-F-A-85380 (30-300 nmol/kg i.v.) and nicotine (20-400 nmol/kg i.v.) increased systolic and diastolic blood pressure, heart rate, and cardiac contractility in rats. Notably, the PR, QRS, or QTc intervals of the rat electrocardiogram were unaffected by either drug. Dosimetry studies indicated that the urinary bladder wall was the critical organ and total radiation exposure was within acceptable limits. Estimated doses of 2-F-A-85380 required to elevate blood pressure and heart rate by 10% ranged from 40 to 58 nmol/kg i.v. Nevertheless, the estimated radiopharmaceutically relevant dose of [(18)F]2-F-A-8380 required for initial PET imaging studies, 10 pmol/kg, is less than 1/4000th of the doses calculated (40-58 nmol/kg i.v.) to elevate blood pressure and heart rate by 10% in humans and should elicit no clinically significant effects and have acceptable dosimetry.",Excluded
2707,"Key factors affecting the spring emergence of pea moth (Cydia nigricana). The hypothesis that spring emergence of the pea moth Cydia nigricana is regulated by environmental factors, particularly photoperiod and temperature, was examined in this study. A long-term field study was conducted in two distinct pea-growing areas in Hesse and Saxony, Germany. Strong correlations between the flight phenology of pea moth in spring and air temperature, soil temperature, solar radiation and day length were demonstrated for three consecutive years. In laboratory experiments, we elucidated the interaction of different photoperiod-temperature regimes, verifying cumulative day-degree data in relation to pea moth emergence rates in the field. C. nigricana temperature sensitivity is apparently initiated by long day conditions with a critical day length of about 14 h L:D. The overall results contribute to the theory that photoperiod and temperature interact as regulatory cues for spring emergence of C. nigricana. The findings are discussed in terms of the development of predictive models and decision support systems for pea moth control.",Excluded
151,"Molecular basis of basal cell carcinogenesis in the atomic-bomb survivor population: p53 and PTCH gene alterations. Epidemiological studies suggest that UV exposure from sunlight is the major etiology for skin cancers, both melanocytic and non-melanocytic. However, the radiation-related risk for skin cancer among atomic bomb survivors of Hiroshima and Nagasaki is primarily derived from the excess risk of basal cell carcinoma (BCC), with no demonstrable excess in squamous cell carcinoma or melanoma. The BCCs in this cohort are therefore unusual in being potentially attributable to two types of radiation - UV and ionizing (IR). BCCs have been associated with PTCH and/or p53 tumor suppressor gene alterations. To investigate the roles of these genes in relation to IR and UV exposures, we analyzed both genes in BCC samples from atomic bomb survivors. We examined 47 tumors, of which 70% had non-silent base-substitution p53 mutations independent of IR or UV exposure. However, the distribution of mutation type depends on UV and/or IR exposure. For example, C-to-T transitions at CpG sites adjacent to pyrimidine-pyrimidine (PyPy) sequences were more prevalent in tumors from UV-exposed than UV-shielded body areas and CpG-mutations at non-PyPy sequences were more prevalent in tumors from UV-shielded body areas with high-IR (>=1 Gy) than low-IR (<0.2 Gy) exposure. And notably, although p53 deletion-frequencies demonstrated no IR-dose associations, deletions at the PTCH locus were more frequent (79% versus 44%) in tumors with high-IR than low-IR exposure. Moreover, 60% of high-IR tumors harbored both p53 and PTCH abnormalities compared with 23% of low-IR tumors. Therefore, alteration of both genes is likely to play a role in radiation-induced basal cell carcinogenesis. © 2006 Oxford University Press.",Excluded
981,"Keratinocyte apoptosis in epidermal remodeling and clearance of psoriasis induced by UV radiation. Psoriasis is a common chronic skin disorder, but the mechanisms involved in the resolution and clearance of plaques remain poorly defined. We investigated the mechanism of action of UVB, which is highly effective in clearing psoriasis and inducing remission, and tested the hypothesis that apoptosis is a key mechanism. To distinguish bystander effects, equal erythemal doses of two UVB wavelengths were compared following in vivo irradiation of psoriatic plaques; one is clinically effective (311 nm) and one has no therapeutic effect on psoriasis (290 nm). Only 311 nm UVB induced significant apoptosis in lesional epidermis, and most apoptotic cells were keratinocytes. To determine clinical relevance, we created a computational model of psoriatic epidermis. Modeling predicted apoptosis would occur in both stem and transit-amplifying cells to account for plaque clearance; this was confirmed and quantified experimentally. The median rate of keratinocyte apoptosis from onset to cell death was 20 minutes. These data were fed back into the model and demonstrated that the observed level of keratinocyte apoptosis was sufficient to explain UVB-induced plaque resolution. Our human studies combined with a systems biology approach demonstrate that keratinocyte apoptosis is a key mechanism in psoriatic plaques clearance, providing the basis for future molecular investigation and therapeutic development.",Excluded
1601,"Inter- and Intraobserver Agreement in Measuring Urolithiasis Density on Nonenhanced Computed Tomography. Introduction: Treatment choice for urolithiasis is partially based on measuring stone density in HU on nonenhanced computed tomography (NECT). Interobserver variability in these measurements could have treatment consequences. This study aims to assess the observer agreement of measuring HU and whether the use of a protocol leads to a better agreement. Material(s) and Method(s): We retrospectively included 155 consecutive NECTs of patients with stones >=4 mm. Five observers (two radiologists, one urologist, one urology resident, and one radiology resident) assessed all anonymized NECTs four times in randomized order. HU was measured without instruction (rounds 1 and 2) and subsequently using two protocols (A and B, rounds 3 and 4). Protocols comprised using bone setting, zoom, and measuring HU without the penumbra, in either three (A) or one (B) axial plane. The inter- and intraobserver agreement was evaluated using the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC). Result(s): Interobserver agreement on HU measurement without protocol was as follows: ICC = 0.84 (confidence interval [CI]: 0.79-0.87). Agreement diminished with protocol A, ICC = 0.62 (CI: 0.37-0.76), and improved with protocol B, ICC = 0.90 (CI: 0.86-0.92). Intraobserver agreement without protocol was ICC = 0.87, with protocol A, ICC = 0.87, and with protocol B, ICC = 0.93. The biggest improvement was seen for urologists' agreement from no protocol to protocol B, where ICC improved from 0.81 (CI: 0.70-0.87) to 0.91 (CI: 0.84-0.94). Conclusion(s): Observer agreement of HU measurement of urolithiasis without protocol is already good but using zoom, bone setting, and measuring in a representative plane is recommended. This protocol results in higher agreement, especially among urologists. Measuring in three axial planes does not increase agreement.Copyright © 2020, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc., publishers 2020.",Excluded
2047,"A new method to precisely control the depth of percutaneous screws into the pedicle by counting the rotation number of the screw with low radiation exposure: technical note. STUDY DESIGN: Technique note., OBJECTIVES: To report a new method for precisely controlling the depth of percutaneous pedicle screws (PPS)-without radiation exposure to surgeons and less fluoroscopy exposure to patients than with conventional methods. PPS is widely used in minimal invasive spine surgery; the advantages include reduced muscle damage, pain, and hospital stays. However, placement of PPS demands repeated checking with fluoroscopy. Thus, radiation exposure is considerable for both surgeons and patients., METHODS: The PPS depth was determined by counting rotations of the screws. The distance between screw threads can be measured for particular screws; thus, full rotations of the PPS results in the screw advancing in the pedicle the distance between screw threads. To fully insert screws into the pedicle, the number of full rotations is equal to the number of threads in the PPS., RESULTS: We applied this technique in 58 patients with thoracolumbar fracture. The position and depth of the screws was checked during the operation with the C-arm and after operation by anteroposterior X-ray film or computed tomography. No additional procedures were required to correct the screws; we observed no neurological deficits or malpositioning of the screws. In the screw placement procedure, the radiation exposure for surgeons is zero, and the patient is well protected from extensive radiation exposure., CONCLUSIONS: This method of counting rotation of screws is a safe way to precisely determine the depth of PPS in the placement procedure., LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: IV.",Excluded
2755,"Self-awareness of computed tomography ordering in the emergency department. OBJECTIVES: Physician variation in the use of computed tomography (CT) is concerning due to the risks of ionizing radiation, cost, and downstream effects of unnecessary testing. The objectives of this study were to describe variation in CT-ordering rates among emergency physicians (EPs), to measure correlation between perceived and actual CT-ordering rates, to assess attitudes that influence decisions to order imaging tests, and to identify EP attitudes associated with higher CT utilization., METHODS: This study was a retrospective review of imaging and administrative billing records at two emergency department sites of a tertiary care adult teaching hospital. The study also included a cross-sectional survey of EPs at this hospital. We asked physicians about their perceived ordering behaviour, and what factors influenced their decision to order a CT. We examined correlations between perceived and actual CT-ordering rates. We adjusted ordering rates for shift distribution using a logistic regression model and identified outlier physicians whose ordering rate was significantly lower or higher than expected. We used multivariable regression analysis to determine which survey responses predicted higher CT utilization., RESULTS: During the study period, 59 EPs saw 45,854 patients, and ordered 6,609 CTs - a mean ordering rate of 14.4% (standard deviation (SD)=4.3%). The ordering rate for individual physicians ranged from 5.9% to 25.9%. Of the 59 EPs, 13 EPs were low-ordering outliers; 12 were high-ordering outliers. Forty-five EPs (76.3%) completed the survey. Mean perceived ordering rate was 12.6%, and was weakly correlated with actual ordering (r=0.19, p=0.21). 42 EPs (93.3%) believed they ordered ""about the same"" or ""fewer"" CTs than their peers. Of the 17 EPs in the two highest ordering quintiles, only 3 (18%) knew they were high orderers. In the multivariable analysis, higher ordering was associated with increasing strength of response to the following predictors: medico-legal risk (relative risk [RR]=1.18, 95% CI: 1.03-1.21), risk of contrast (RR=1.14, 95% CI: 1.07-1.22), what colleagues would do (RR=1.09, 95% CI: 0.99-1.19), risk of missing a diagnosis (RR=1.08, 95% CI: 0.98-1.21), and patient wishes (RR=1.07, 95% CI: 0.97-1.17)., CONCLUSIONS: There is large variation in CT ordering among EPs. Physicians' self-reported ordering rate correlates poorly with actual ordering. High CT orderers were rarely aware that they ordered more than their colleagues. Higher rates of ordering were observed among physicians who reported increased concern with 1) risk of missing a diagnosis, 2) medico-legal risk, 3) risk of contrast, 4) patient wishes, and 5) what colleagues would do.",Excluded
25,"[Possibilities of prognostication of individual radiation sensitivity]. Proceeding from the concept of individual radiosensitivity as a sign of total reactivity 3 directions in a study of its possible prediction were considered: establishing correlation between separate indices characterizing the initial state and total radiosensitivity; correlation between body reactions to non-radiation exposures and subsequent irradiation; comparison of total radiosensitivity to irradiation at a small dose and subsequent irradiation at LD50. The following indices were used for the evaluation of the basal status of the body: oxygen consumption level, body mass increase rate, the level of water and basal metabolism, peripheral blood indices, body temperature, basal indices of the functional adrenocortical activity, the state of the cardiovascular system. The following non-radiation stress-exposures were used: physical exercise, constant magnetic field, starvation, hypoxia, and adrenaline administration. A V-type dependency was established for most investigated indices of the basal status and reaction of the body to non-radiation exposures. The utmost radioresistance was shown by animals in whom the basal indices or their reaction to non-radiation exposure approximated the average group level. The third direction: comparison of radiosensitivity and radiation damage--was analyzed by comparing the reaction of cerebral biocurrents to radiation exposure at a small dose with subsequent damage of the body following irradiation at a lethal dose. The accuracy of predicting the outcome of radiation injury by some of the indices varied from 65 to 80%. In some indices of the basal status and reactivity evaluation it reached 85-90%.",Excluded
571,"Photocontact dermatitis from ketoprofen and tiaprofenic acid: Cross-reactivity study in 12 consecutive patients. The arylpropionic acid derivatives (APADs) ketoprofen and tiaprofenic acid can provoke photoallergic dermatitis. Possible cross-reactivity between APADs is of importance in patients using nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. Because of the similarities in chemical structures, we investigated patients with photoallergy to ketoprofen or tiaprofenic acid, in order to study cross-reactivity between APADs and a possible pattern of cross-reactivity between benzophenone-containing molecules, so as to determine the molecular basis of photoallergy to ketoprofen or tiaprofenic acid. 10 patients with photoallergy to topical ketoprofen, 2 with photoallergy to oral tiaprofenic acid, and 15 control subjects with no history of contact dermatitis from APADs, nor from benzophenone-containing molecules, were photopatch tested in triplicate with ketoprofen, tiaprofenic acid, other APADs (alminoprofen, fenoprofen, flurbiprofen, ibuprofen and naproxen), benzophenone-containing molecules (fenofibrate, oxybenzone, sulisobenzone), and unsubstituted benzophenone. 1 set was irradiated with UVA light, 1 with solar-simulated irradiation and 1 dark control. Tests were read at 2, 3 and 4 days. Patients reacted to both ketoprofen and tiaprofenic acid (12/12), fenofibrate (8/12), oxybenzone (3/12) and unsubstituted benzophenone (11/12), but not to other APADs, nor to sulisobenzone. Tests remained negative in control patients. Photoallergy is due to the benzophenone moiety of ketoprofen, or to the very similar thiophene-phenylketone of tiaprofenic acid, but not to their arylpropionic function. This induces cross-reactivity to fenofibrate and oxybenzone but not to APADs without a benzophenone moiety, which may therefore probably be used in such patients. Unsubstituted benzophenone should be added to standard phototesting series.",Excluded
1502,"Development of a medical examination program for former workers at a Department of Energy national laboratory. BACKGROUND: As a part of the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) Former Workers' Medical Surveillance Program, a Needs Assessment was conducted at Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL). The objective was to identify former LANL employees who may be at significant risk for occupational disease and determine whether a medical examination program could reduce morbidity or mortality. We describe the needs assessment approach used at LANL., METHODS: An algorithm was developed to make needs determinations. Information on factors including exposure, health impacts, size of exposed populations, and LANL worker concerns and recommendations were obtained. Each of these factors was scored from 1 to 3. The resulting factor sum was then multiplied by a binary (1 or 0) intervention suitability factor which was 1 if both of the following were available: (1) a screening test with acceptable sensitivity and specificity for the health outcome of concern; and (2) an intervention that decreases morbidity or mortality. This resulted in an Intervention Needs Score that was used to set priorities for the medical examination program for the estimated 35,000 former LANL workers., RESULTS: Analysis of the algorithm output suggested that six exposure categories be recommended for consideration in a medical examination program. Beryllium, asbestos, and noise clearly warranted inclusion. Lead and ionizing radiation required careful consideration regarding availability of screening tests. Solvents were problematic due to the lack of screening tests and suitable intervention in formerly exposed workers., CONCLUSIONS: The algorithm approach to the needs assessment at LANL documented that six chemical and physical agents should be considered as candidates for inclusion in a medical examination program for former workers.

2381,"Phase II study of preoperative helical tomotherapy with a simultaneous integrated boost for rectal cancer. PURPOSE: The addition of concomitant chemotherapy to preoperative radiotherapy is considered the standard of care for patients with cT3-4 rectal cancer. The combined treatment modality increases the complete response rate and local control (LC), but has no impact on survival or the incidence of distant metastases. In addition, it is associated with considerable toxicity. As an alternative strategy, we explored prospectively, preoperative helical tomotherapy with a simultaneous integrated boost (SIB)., METHODS AND MATERIALS: A total of 108 patients were treated with intensity-modulated and image-guided radiotherapy using the Tomotherapy Hi-Art II system. A dose of 46 Gy, in daily fractions of 2 Gy, was delivered to the mesorectum and draining lymph nodes, without concomitant chemotherapy. Patients with an anticipated circumferential resection margin (CRM) of less than 2 mm, based on magnetic resonance imaging, received a SIB to the tumor up to a total dose of 55.2 Gy. Acute and late side effects were scored using the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events version 3.0., RESULTS: A total of 102 patients presented with cT3-4 tumors; 57 patients entered the boost group and 51 the no-boost group. One patient in the no-boost group developed a radio-hypersensitivity reaction, resulting in a complete tumor remission, a Grade 3 acute and Grade 5 late enteritis. No other Grade >=3 acute toxicities occurred. With a median follow-up of 32 months, Grade >=3 late gastrointestinal and urinary toxicity were observed in 6% and 4% of the patients, respectively.

902,"Cytoplasmic chromatin triggers inflammation in senescence and cancer. Chromatin is traditionally viewed as a nuclear entity that regulates gene expression and silencing. However, we recently discovered the presence of cytoplasmic chromatin fragments that pinch off from intact nuclei of primary cells during senescence, a form of terminal cell-cycle arrest associated with pro-inflammatory responses. The functional significance of chromatin in the cytoplasm is unclear. Here we show that cytoplasmic chromatin activates the innate immunity cytosolic DNA-sensing cGAS-STING (cyclic GMP-AMP synthase linked to stimulator of interferon genes) pathway, leading both to short-term inflammation to restrain activated oncogenes and to chronic inflammation that associates with tissue destruction and cancer. The cytoplasmic chromatin-cGAS-STING pathway promotes the senescence-associated secretory phenotype in primary human cells and in mice. Mice deficient in STING show impaired immuno-surveillance of oncogenic RAS and reduced tissue inflammation upon ionizing radiation. Furthermore, this pathway is activated in cancer cells, and correlates with pro-inflammatory gene expression in human cancers. Overall, our findings indicate that genomic DNA serves as a reservoir to initiate a pro-inflammatory pathway in the cytoplasm in senescence and cancer. Targeting the cytoplasmic chromatin-mediated pathway may hold promise in treating inflammation-related disorders.Copyright © 2017 Macmillan Publishers Limited, part of Springer Nature.

The objective of this study was to investigate the correlation between local recurrence and radiotherapeutic parameters, including dose and RT radiotherapy (RT) field. METHODS. The current study included 35 patients who were diagnosed with immunohistochemically confirmed nasal natural killer (NK)/T-cell lymphoma between 1976 and 2004. There were 21 males and 14 females, and they ranged in age from 18 years to 76 years (median, 51 yrs). The primary tumor originated in the nasal cavity in 28 patients, and 32 patients had Stage I disease. Seventeen patients received treatment solely with RT, and the remaining 18 patients received a combination of chemotherapy and RT. The median tumor dose was 50 grays (Gy) (range, 22-60 Gy). Twenty-seven patients received RT to include all macroscopic lesions, all paranasal sinuses, the palate, and the nasopharynx. Eight patients received RT to all macroscopic lesions with generous margins. RESULTS. A complete remission (CR) or a CR/unconfirmed was achieved in 28 patients (80%). The 5-year overall survival (OAS) rate, disease-free survival (DFS) rate, and local control probability (LCP) were 47.3%, 42.9%, and 65.2%, respectively. Patients who received RT only to macroscopic lesions fared less well in terms of LCP (LCP 5 years, 71.9% vs. 41.7%; P = 0.007). The difference in RT field also affected both the OAS rate and the DFS rate. Patients who received RT doses >= 50 Gy tended to achieve favorable local control. CONCLUSIONS.

To improve the prognosis of limited stage small cell lung cancer (LS-SCLC) the addition of concurrent thoracic radiotherapy to a platinum-containing regimen is important. In the Netherlands, we initiated a multicenter, phase II study, of the combination of four cycles of carboplatin (AUC 5), paclitaxel (200 mg m(-2)) and etoposide (2 x 50 mg orally for 5 days) combined with 45 Gy (daily fractions of 1.8 Gy).

3244,"TWO FACTORS INFLUENCING DOSE RECONSTRUCTION IN LOW DOSE RANGE: THE VARIABILITY OF BKG INTENSITY ON ONE INDIVIDUAL AND WATER CONTENT. A fast and accurate retrospective dosimetry method for the triage is very important in radiation accidents. Electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) fingernail dosimetry is a promising way to estimate radiation dose. This article presents two factors influencing dose reconstruction in low dose range: the variability of background signal (BKG) intensity on one individual and water content. Comparing the EPR spectrum of dried and humidified fingernail samples, it is necessary to add a procedure of dehydration before EPR measurements, so as to eliminate the deviation caused by water content. Besides, the BKGs of different fingers' nails are not the same as researchers thought previously, and the difference between maximum and minimum BKG intensities of one individual can reach 55.89 %. Meanwhile, the variability of the BKG intensity among individuals is large enough to impact precise dose reconstruction. Water within fingernails and instability of BKG are two reasons that cause the inaccuracy of radiation dose reconstruction in low-dosage level.Copyright © The Author 2015.

These results suggest that performing a derotational femoral osteotomy to prevent osteoarthritis is not indicated. The cause of primary osteoarthritis is multifactorial and does not depend solely on preexistence of higher femoral anteversion.""",Excluded
281,"Characteristic imaging findings predicting the risk of conservative treatment resistance in fresh osteoporotic vertebral fractures with poor prognostic features on magnetic resonance imaging. Background: Recent studies have reported that confined high-intensity and diffuse low-intensity on sagittal T2-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) are distinctive features that are highly predictive of delayed union or nonunion on osteoporotic vertebral fracture (OVF). The objective of this study was to identify the characteristics of imaging findings predicting the risk for requiring surgical treatment in fresh OVF with poor prognostic features on MRI. Method(s): We conducted a retrospective study of 74 patients (17 men and 57 women with a mean age of 81.1 years) of OVF with the poor prognostic MRI findings. We compared the imaging findings between the surgery group (16 patients) and the conservative group (58 patients): vertebral instability defined as the difference between the vertebral collapse ratio in dynamic X-rays, and the grade of posterior wall injury (Grade I, no spinal canal encroachment; Grade II, <2 mm; Grade III, >=2 mm) as well as the presence or absence of pedicle fracture (Grade I, none; Grade II, unilateral; Grade III, bilateral) on computed tomography. Result(s): The mean vertebral instability was 24.0% +/- 10.1% in the surgery group and 13.0% +/- 7.8% in the conservative group, which was significantly different. Posterior wall injury in the surgery and conservative groups was Grade I in 0 and 29 cases, Grade II in 5 and 21 cases, and Grade III in 11 and 8 cases, respectively, constituting a significant difference. Pedicle fracture in the surgery and conservative groups was Grade I in 5 and 55 cases, Grade II in 6 and 2 cases, and Grade III in 5 and 1 case, respectively, also constituting a significant difference. Conclusion(s): The most high-risk OVF patients with poor prognostic MRI findings who required surgical treatment were those who exhibited greater vertebral instability as well as either more severe posterior wall injury or pedicle fracture.

878,"New recommendation and coverage of low-dose computed tomography for lung cancer screening: uptake has increased but is still low. BACKGROUND: In 2013, the US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) issued recommendations for low-dose computed tomography for lung cancer screening (LDCT-LCS), but there continues to be a dearth of information on the adoption of LDCT-LCS in healthcare systems. Using a multilevel perspective, our study aims to assess referrals for LDCT-LCS and identify facilitators and barriers to adoption following recent policy changes. METHOD(S): A retrospective analysis of electronic medical record data from patients aged 55-80 years with no history of lung cancer who visited a primary care provider in a large healthcare system in California during 2010-2016 (1,572,538 patient years). Trends in documentation of smoking history, number of eligible patients, and lung cancer screening orders were assessed. Using Hierarchical Generalized Linear Models, we also evaluated provider-level and patient-level factors associated with lung cancer screening orders among 970 primary care providers and 12,801 eligible patients according to USPSTF guidelines between January 1st, 2014 and December 31st, 2016. RESULT(S): Documentation of smoking history to determine eligibility (59.2% in 2010 to 77.8% in 2016) and LDCT-LCS orders (0% in 2010 to 7.3% in 2016) have increased since USPSTF guidelines. Patient factors associated with increased likelihood of lung cancer screening orders include: younger patient age (78-80 vs. 55-64 years old: OR, 0.4; 95% CI, 0.3-0.7), Asian race (vs. Non-Hispanic White: OR, 1.6; 95% CI, 1.1-2.4), reported current smoking (vs. former smoker: OR, 1.7; 95% CI, 1.4-2.0), no severe comorbidity (severe vs. no major comorbidity: OR=0.2, 95% CI=0.1-0.3; moderate vs. no major comorbidity: OR=0.5; 95% CI=0.4-0.7), and making a visit to own primary care provider (vs. other primary care providers: OR, 2.4; 95% CI, 1.7-3.4). Appropriate referral for lung cancer screening varies considerably across primary care providers. Provider factors include being a female physician (vs. male: OR, 1.6; 95% CI, 1.1-2.3) and receiving medical training in the US (foreign vs. US medical school graduates: OR=0.4, 95% CI=0.3-0.7). CONCLUSION(S): Future interventions to improve lung cancer screening may be more effective if they focus on accurate documentation of smoking history and target former smokers who do not regularly see their own primary care providers.",Excluded

Decreased tolerance to glare is a common complaint in hydrogel contact lens wearers; yet, to our knowledge, the effect has never been quantified. By measuring increment thresholds as a function of background luminance and glare source location in two experimental conditions, while wearing a hydrogel contact lens correction and while wearing the spherical equivalent of their contact lens correction in a trial frame, we were able to quantify a significant contact lens-induced increase in glare-related visual disability. The effect is maximal at low background luminance levels, increases as the angle between the glare source and target decreases, and becomes lost in noise at high background luminance levels.",Excluded
3137,"Upfront gefitinib/erlotinib treatment followed by concomitant radiotherapy for advanced lung cancer: A mono-institutional experience. Background: Upfront tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) has proved effective for selective advanced lung cancer patients in Taiwan. We hypothesized that early integration of radiotherapy during TKI treatment would decrease the chance of drug resistance and prolong progression-free survival (PFS). Method(s): This study included 25 patients with stage IIIb or IV non-squamous cell, non-small cell lung cancer (NSqCLC) who responded to upfront TKI treatment. Multi-target radiotherapy was administered during the TKI treatment course. Tomotherapy comprising a hypofractionated schedule with a dose of 40-50. Gy in 16-20 fractions was used for individual metastatic lesions. Result(s): The patients' median follow-up duration was 30 months (range, 9-62 months). Of the 23 patients who had stage IV disease, 9 had oligometastases (<=5 gross target volumes) and 14 were in the more advanced stages of the disease. Twelve patients received more than 1 cycle of radiotherapy (median, 3; range, 2-6) with TKI being the only systemic treatment before they were salvaged with chemotherapy. The overall response rate after radiotherapy was 84.0%, and the median PFS was 16 months. The 3-year overall survival rate was 62.5% (95% confidence interval [CI], 39.1-85.8%). Toxicities were generally tolerated but it is necessary to prevent radiation-induced pneumonitis. Conclusion(s): We showed that combined first-line TKI therapy and early multi-target radiotherapy are very effective in selected patients that respond to TKI, when the status of mutations in the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) are not known before the treatment. Our data may aid expansion of the effectiveness of TKI treatment through radiotherapy in Asian patients with stage IV NSqCLC. © 2010 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.",Excluded

PURPOSE: To determine the long-term effects of stereotactic fractionated external beam radiation on eyes treated for neovascular age-related macular degeneration., METHODS: A retrospective review of all eyes treated with stereotactic fractionated external beam radiation (20-40 Gy, 2-Gy fractions) between 1997 and 2000 was performed to identify eyes with >= 2-year follow-up for analysis. A subset was imaged prospectively using a high-resolution Fourier-domain optical coherence tomography., RESULTS: Among 94 eyes treated, 33 eyes (32 subjects) had >= 2-year follow-up information (mean follow-up, 6.2 years; range, 2-10 years). Final visual acuity ranged from 20/50 to no light perception. Final macular findings included central geographic atrophy (49%), disciform scar (30%), and active choroidal neovascular membrane (9%). Fourier-domain optical coherence tomography images of three eyes with geographic atrophy revealed photoreceptor layer loss within areas of geographic atrophy with intact retinal morphology in areas of radiation exposure outside geographic atrophy. Radiation retinopathy was suspected in 18% and confirmed by fluorescein angiography in 15%, ranging from mild to neovascular glaucoma/phthisis bulbi (2 eyes). Mean time from stereotactic fractionated external beam radiation to development of radiation retinopathy was 5.4 years (range, 1-10 years)., CONCLUSION: A moderate rate of delayed radiation retinopathy was noted in eyes with neovascular age-related macular degeneration treated with stereotactic fractionated external beam radiation.

357,"Induction of micronuclei in human sperm-hamster egg hybrids at the two-cell stage after in vitro gamma-irradiation of human spermatozoa. The efficiency of the micronucleus test to assess radiation-induced chromosomal damage in human spermatozoa has been investigated. Micronuclei were scored in human sperm-hamster egg hybrids at the two-cell stage, after exposure of human spermatozoa to in vitro gamma-rays at doses of 0.00, 0.10, 0.25, 0.50, 1.00, 2.00, and 4.00 Gy. The relationship between the yield of micronuclei per two-cell stage as well as the percentage of two-cell stages with micronuclei and the different doses of irradiation were fitted to linear equations. To evaluate whether scoring micronuclei is useful for the quantification of chromosomal damage occurring in human spermatozoa, induced micronuclei at the different doses of sperm irradiation were compared to the induction of breaks and fragments in sperm-derived chromosomes. After interspecific fertilization of zona-free hamster oocytes by irradiated spermatozoa, a total of 699 fertilized eggs at the two-cell stage and a total of 387 sperm-derived complements were analyzed. The incidence of fertilized eggs with micronuclei at the two-cell stage coincided well with the incidence of sperm-derived chromosome breaks and fragments (e.g., 8.9% vs. 6.7% in the 0.25 Gy group and 52.8% vs. 58.6% in the 4.00 Gy group). A similar correlation was found between the number of micronuclei per two-cell stage and the number of breaks and fragments per sperm complement (0.09 vs. 0.07 in the 0.25 Gy group and 0.71 vs. 0.81 in the 4.00 Gy group). The results show that this test system can be used for the quantification of spontaneous or induced chromosomal damage in human spermatozoa.",Excluded
1413,"Feasibility of omitting clinical target volume for limited-disease small cell lung cancer treated with chemotherapy and intensity-modulated radiotherapy. PURPOSE: To analyze the feasibility of omitting clinical target volume (CTV) for limited small cell lung cancer treated with chemotherapy and intensity modulated radiotherapy., METHODS AND MATERIALS: 89 patients were treated from January 1, 2008 to August 31, 2011, 54 cases were irradiated with target volume without CTV, and 35 cases were irradiated with CTV. Both arms were irradiated post chemotherapy tumor extent and omitted elective nodal irradiation; dose prescription was 95% PTV56-63 Gy/28-35 F/5.6-7 weeks., RESULTS: In the arm without CTV and arm with CTV, the local relapse rates were 16.7% and 17.1% (p=0.586) respectively. In the arm without CTV, of the 9 patients with local relapse, 6 recurred in-field, 2 recurred in margin, 1 recurred out of field. In the arm with CTV, of the 6 patients with local relapse, 4 recurred in-field, 1 recurred in margin, 1 recurred out of field. The distant metastases rates were 42.6% and 51.4% (p=0.274) respectively. Grade 3-4 hematological toxicity and radiation esophagitis had no statistically significant, but grade 3-4 radiation pneumonia was observed in only 7.4% in the arm without CTV, compared 22.9% in the arm with CTV (p=0.040). The median survival in the arm without CTV had not reached, compared with 38 months in the with CTV arm.

Aim and background: An optimal break between radiotherapy (RT) and surgery in short-course of RT (SCRT) for locally advanced rectal cancer is not clearly established.The aim of the study was to investigate the influence of the break in the preoperative SCRT and overall treatment time (OTT) for locally advanced rectal cancer patients (whole group and male/female subgroups) on patients overall survival (OS), recurrence-free survival (RFS), metastasis-free survival (MFS). Material(s) and Method(s): 131 patients were treated with SCRT (5 Gy/5 days), followed by surgery 3-53 days later. Break was calculated as the time interval between the end of irradiation to surgery and OTT as time interval from the beginning of RT to surgery. Result(s): Mean break was 21.5 (range 3-53.0) days and mean OTT was 26.5 (range 7-58.0) days. In univariate analysis, a break longer than 15 days and OTT >23 days were negative prognostic factors for OS for all patients, and particularly for the male patients' subgroup. RFS was non-significantly higher (P = 0.066) for patients treated with a break <=15 days and OTT <=23 days (P = 0.099), irrespectively of patients' sex. Patients treated with a break longer than 15 days and OTT >23 days had non-significantly lower level of MFS than those treated with a shorter break (P = 0.269) and OTT <=23 days (P = 0.498). Conclusion(s): In SCRT, a break in the treatment longer than 15 days, especially in the male patients subgroup, should be avoided, because it negatively affects patients' survival.Copyright © 2016 Greater Poland Cancer Centre.",Excluded
535,"Randomized clinical trial on 7-days-a-week post-operative radiotherapy vs concurrent post-operative radiochemotherapy in locally advanced cancer of the oral cavity/oropharynx: a report on acute normal tissue reactions. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of the study was to evaluate acute normal tissue reactions and treatment compliance in a randomized clinical trial on 7-days-a-week post-operative radiotherapy (p-CAIR) vs post-operative concurrent radiochemotherapy (p-RTCT) in locally advanced cancer of the oral cavity/oropharynx. The sample analyzed at present represents approximately 30% of the intended future trial size., METHODS: The patients were randomly assigned to receive 63 Gy in 1.8-Gy fractions 7 days a week (n = 44) or 63 Gy in 1.8-Gy fractions 5 days a week with concurrent cisplatin 80-100 mg per square metre of body surface area on Days 1, 22 and 43 of the course of radiotherapy (n = 40). Acute mucosal reactions were scored using the modified Dische system., RESULTS: 15 (17.9%) patients, including 5 patients in p-CAIR and 10 patients in p-RTCT, did not comply with the assigned radiation treatment, mostly because of rapid tumour progression or deteriorating general performance. In p-RTCT, 22 (55%) patients received less than the intended three courses of chemotherapy mostly owing to haematological toxicity. The average maximum mucosal severity score was 14.2 in p-CAIR compared with 13.4 in p-RTCT; the difference was not statistically significant (p = 0.31)., CONCLUSION: The schedules compared (p-CAIR and p-RTCT) did not differ considerably with respect to acute mucosal reactions. Haematological toxicity in p-RTCT was elevated compared with p-CAIR. Both schedules were considered tolerable with respect to acute toxicity, which justifies further recruitment to the trial., ADVANCES IN KNOWLEDGE: The results show that early mucosal reactions are comparable in both trial arms but haematological toxicity is more pronounced during radiochemotherapy.",Excluded

Method(s): Imaging data of 7 patients aged from 23 to 56 years (mean age 39.5 years) with bone echinococcosis were analysed retrospectively. All cases underwent X-ray plain film examination (frontal view and lateral view); 4 cases were examined with CT; 3 cases received MRI scan. Result(s): The echinococcosis located in skull (1 case), vertebrae (3 cases), sacrum (1 case), ilium (1 case) and ribs (1 case) respectively. X-ray signs: 5 cases appeared as expanding destructive lesion, two of them were solitary cystic lesions, the others were multiple cystic lesions. Lytic destruction was showed in 2 cases. Sclerotic margin, calcification, soft tissue mass was visible in 5, 1 and 4 cases respectively. CT signs: 3 of 4 cases were expanding destructive lesions, including 2 multiple cystic lesions and 1 solitary cystic destruction. The other one showed lytic destruction. 3 had sclerotic margin; calcification was identified in 2 cases, 4 cases accompanied with soft tissue mass. MRI signs: All of 3 cases occurred at vertebrae, solitary cystic lesion in one and multiple cystic lesions in two. Lesions showed low signal on T1WI image, high signal on T2WI image and appeared as grape shapes. Involved vertebrae showed wedge-shaped.

This study aims to investigate the feasibility of quantitative ultrasonic backscatter in evaluating human cortical and trabecular bone densities in vivo based on a head-down-tilt bed rest study, with 36 participants tested through 90 d of bed rest and 180 d of recovery. Backscatter measurements were performed using an ultrasonic backscatter bone diagnostic instrument. Backscatter parameters were calculated with a dynamic signal-of-interest method, which was proposed to ensure the same ultrasonic interrogated volume in cortical and trabecular bones. The backscatter parameters exhibited significant correlations with site-matched bone densities provided by high-resolution peripheral quantitative computed tomography (0.33 < R < 0.72, p < 0.05). Some bone densities and backscatter parameters exhibited significant changes after the 90-d bed rest. The proposed method can be used to characterize bone densities, and the portable ultrasonic backscatter bone diagnostic device might be used to non-invasively reveal mean bone loss (across a group of people) after long-term bed rest and microgravity conditions of spaceflight missions.Copyright © 2021 World Federation for Ultrasound in Medicine & Biology",Excluded

845,"Immune events associated with protection in C57BL/6 mice immunized with anti-idiotypic antibodies mimicking protective antigens shared between gamma-irradiated cercariae vaccine and human resistance model of Schistosoma haematobium. Immunoregulation is central for successful manipulation of schistosomiasis. Unlike schistosome vaccine development strategies that relied on direct selection of antigens from crude responses leading to selection of mildly protective antigens, the present study tested the utility of selection of potentially protective antigens encompassed rounds of immunoregulation via idiotypic network. Anti-idiotypic antibodies (Ab2) were purified from sera of New Zealand white rabbits multiply immunized with gamma-irradiated cercariae of S. haematobium, using adult worm specific idiotypes (Ab1) purified from sera of subjects resistant to reinfection. Ab2 was used for immunization of C57BL/6 mice and consequences of immunization were monitored before and after challenge infection with S. haematobium. Results showed an increase of splenic T cell expression of intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) and very late antigen-4 (VLA-4) upon immunization (average % stimulated cells 54.9 vs. 20.4, P < 0.05 for ICAM-1 and 31.1 vs. 6.6, P < 0.01 for VLA-4) and challenge, especially at day 6 (83.5 vs. 45.6, P < 0.01) for ICAM-1 and day 10 (50.4 vs. 20.8, P < 0.05) for VLA-4. Thereafter, both adhesion molecules declined at day 28 through 90. Similarly, lymphoproliferation was manifested upon immunization (OD570-630 0.27 vs. 0.09, P < 0.01) and challenge at day 6 (0.5 vs. 0.17, P < 0.01) through day 10 (0.49 vs.0.18, P < 0.05), then declined at day 28 through 90. Moreover, sera of Ab2-immunized mice exhibited an anti-anti-ids (Ab3) reactivity against antigens of approximate molecular weight 40, 80 and 160 kDa of adult worms, which were also recognized by Ab1. However, in contrast to Ab1, Ab3 showed no surface binding to 3 hr schistosomula. Strikingly, mice immunized with Ab2 showed strong resistance to challenge infection (approximately 82% reduction in worm burden, P < 0.001). Taking all, this alternative vaccine development strategy appears to filter out non-protective antigens. Indeed Ab3 recognizes much fewer numbers of antigens, which passed through two rounds of immune regulation. These antigens appear to represent a significant proportion of the protective response in the gamma-irradiated cercariae vaccine and human resistance model as well, providing the basis for an alternative vaccine for schistosomiasis.",Excluded
188,"Spin echo functional MRI in bilateral auditory cortices at 7T: An application of B1 shimming. Ultra high fields (UHF) permit unprecedented explorations of functional organizations and insight into basic neuronal processes. Increases in the signal and contrast to noise ratios have allowed increases in the spatial resolution of T2* weighted gradient echo (GE) echo planar imaging (EPI). Furthermore, while the use of T2 weighted imaging methods at UHF (e.g. spin echo (SE) EPI, gradient and spin echo (GRASE) EPI) can also permit higher resolution images, they in addition allow for increased spatial specificity of functional responses, permitting the in-vivo study of functional organizations down to the columnar level of the cortex. The study of the visual cortex has, thus far, benefitted the most from higher resolution T2 weighted studies as achieving the required transmit B1 magnitude at 7T is more challenging in other brain regions, such as the auditory cortex. As such, auditory fMRI studies at UHF have been limited to T2* weighted GE sequences. Recent advances in multi-channel RF transmission (e.g. B1 shimming) have enabled procedures to efficiently address deficiencies in transmit B1 profiles. However, these techniques, shown to be advantageous in anatomical imaging at UHF, are not generally utilized to facilitate T2 weighted fMRI studies.Here we investigate the feasibility of applying B1 shimming to achieve efficient RF transmission in the human auditory cortex. We demonstrate that, with B1 shimming, functional responses to simple tones and to complex sounds (i.e. voices, speech, animal cries, tools and nature) can be efficiently measured with T2 weighted SE-EPI in the bilateral human auditory cortex at 7T without exceeding specific absorption rate (SAR) limits. © 2012 Elsevier Inc.",Excluded

Purpose: Acute toxicity in head and neck (H&N) cancer patients treated with definitive radiotherapy (RT) has a crucial role in compliance to treatments. The aim of this study was to correlate doses to swallowing-associated structures and acute dysphagia. Method(s): We prospectively analyzed 42 H&N cancer patients treated with RT. Dysphagia (grade >= 3) and indication for percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) insertion were classified as acute toxicity. Ten swallowing-related structures were considered for the dosimetric analysis. The correlation between clinical information and the dose absorbed by the contoured structures was analyzed. Multivariate logistic regression method using resampling methods (bootstrapping) was applied to select model order and parameters for normal tissue complication probability (NTCP) modelling. Result(s): A strong multiple correlation between dosimetric parameters was found. A two-variable model was suggested as the optimal order by bootstrap method. The optimal model (Rs = 0.452, p < 0.001) includes V45 of the cervical esophagus (odds ratio [OR] = 1.016) and Dmean of the cricopharyngeal muscle (OR = 1.057).

1586,"Active cutaneous leishmaniasis associated with invasive squamous cell carcinoma coexistent in the same lesion: A case report. Background: Cutaneous leishmaniasis is an infectious disease caused by a parasitic protozoan belonging to the genus Leishmania. Squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) is the second most common type of malignant neoplasm of the skin, usually caused by chronic solar exposure. Malignant degeneration of chronic healed or unhealed ulcers is an uncommon event called Marjolin's ulcer and mostly refers to SCC. Infectious diseases are one of the causes of chronic wounds and it has been described, although rare, cases of development of SCC on scar tissue of previous cutaneous leishmaniasis, but not in recent and active lesion. We present a case not yet reported in the literature of a cutaneous lesion of SCC and cutaneous leishmaniasis associated and diagnosed at the same time. Observation: A 72-year-old. man, black, came for his first consultation with a cervical lesion with seven months history, with progressive growth for the last 2 months, associated with local burning sensation. On dermatological examination, an ulcerated nodule with infiltrated and elevated borders with 4.5 x 5.0 cm was found in the posterior cervical region. The differential diagnosis were SCC, BCC, cutaneous metastasis and cutaneous leishmaniasis. A punch biopsy was performed and histopathological examination revealed a moderately differentiated invasive squamous cell carcinoma on the epidermis with an ulcerated area on the surface of the tumor, showing parasitic structures compatible with Leishmania sp and focal cell marking for leishmaniasis by immunohistochemistry. After the treatment of the leishmaniasis with liposomal amphotericin, the patient was referred for surgical treatment of the SCC. Key message: The rarity of the case presented is evident by the lack of publication available, and to our knowledge, none with such short evolution and associated diagnosis. Thus here we should question if the SCC has evolved in a leishmaniasis ulcer or whether leishmaniasis has developed in a pre-existing SCC.",Excluded

1449,"Cerebellar modulation of feeding-related neurons in rat dorsomedial hypothalamic nucleus. Cerebellum has newly been implicated in many more nonsomatic functions other than motor control. Previous studies indicate that the cerebellum is involved in feeding regulation and that the gastric vagal nerves transmit short-term meal-related visceral signals, including cholecystokinin (CCK), into the hypothalamus. Recently, the dorsomedial hypothalamic nucleus (DMN) has been thought to play an important role in feeding control. Here we investigate whether the inputs from cerebellar interpositus nucleus (IN) can reach and converge onto single DMN neurons with some feeding-related visceral signals, including gastric vagal inputs, CCK, and blood glucose, whose concentration is closely linked to food intake. Among the 259 DMN neurons recorded, 120 (46.3%) and 169 (65.3%) responded to the cerebellar IN and gastric vagal stimulations, respectively. Within the 120 DMN neurons responsive to the cerebellar IN stimulation, 98 (81.7%) also responded to the gastric vagal stimulus, and a summation of the responses was observed further (n = 20), suggesting a convergence and interaction of cerebellar and gastric vagal inputs on the cells. Moreover, among the 98 cells receiving convergent inputs from cerebellar IN and gastric vagal nerves, 69 (70.4%) were identified to be glycemia sensitive, and 22 (68.8%) of the 32 tested neurons were also sensitive to systemic CCK. These results demonstrate that the DMN integrates somatic information forwarded by the cerebellar IN and visceral signals related to food intake, including gastric vagal, CCK and glycemia, and electrophysiologically reveal a novel cerebellohypothalamic IN-DMN pathway through which the cerebellum may actively participate in short-term feeding regulation.",Excluded
175,"The acute side effects of bright light therapy: a placebo-controlled investigation. Despite the emergence of numerous clinical and non-clinical applications of bright light therapy (LT) in recent decades, the prevalence and severity of LT side effects have not yet been fully explicated. A few adverse LT effects-headache, eye strain, irritability, and nausea-have been consistently reported among depressed individuals and other psychiatric cohorts, but there exists little published evidence regarding LT side effects in non-clinical populations, who often undergo LT treatment of considerably briefer duration. Accordingly, in the present study we examined, in a randomized sample of healthy young adults, the acute side effects of exposure to a single 30-minute session of bright white light (10,000 lux) versus dim red light (< 500 lux). Across a broad range of potential side effects, repeated-measures analyses of variance revealed no significant group-by-time (Pre, Post) interactions. In other words, bright light exposure was not associated with a significantly higher incidence of any reported side effect than was the placebo control condition. Nevertheless, small but statistically significant increases in both eye strain and blurred vision were observed among both the LT and control groups. Overall, these results suggest that the relatively common occurrence of adverse side effects observed in the extant LT literature may not fully extend to non-clinical populations, especially for healthy young adults undergoing LT for a brief duration.",Excluded

Method(s): Pre-operative MRI reports of 144 glioma patients in a single institution were collected retrospectively. Words were transformed to lowercase letters. White spaces, punctuations, and stop words were removed. Stemming was performed. A word cloud method applied to processed text matrix visualized language behavior. Spearman's rank correlation assessed the correlation between the subjective descriptions of the enhancement pattern. The T1-contrast images associated with enhancement descriptions were selected. The keywords associated with IDH status were evaluated by chi2 value ranking. Random forest, k-nearest neighbors and Support Vector Machine algorithms were used to train models based on report features and age. All statistical analysis used two-tailed test with significance at p <.05. Result(s): Longer word counts occurred in reports of older patients, higher grade gliomas, and wild type IDH gliomas. We identified 30 glioma enhancement descriptions, eight of which were commonly used: peripheral, heterogeneous, irregular, nodular, thick, rim, large, and ring. Five of eight patterns were correlated. IDH mutant tumors were characterized by words related to normal, symmetric or negative findings. IDH wild type tumors were characterized words by related to pathological MR findings like enhancement, necrosis and FLAIR foci. An integrated KNN model based on report features and age demonstrated high-performance (AUC: 0.89, 95% CI: 0.88-0.90). Conclusion(s): Report length depended on age, glioma grade, and IDH status. Description of glioma enhancement was varied. Report descriptions differed for IDH wild and mutant gliomas. Report features can be used to predict glioma IDH status.© Copyright © 2021 Cao, Erson-Omay, Gunel, Moliterno and Fulbright.",Excluded
2760,"Electron beam radiation for conjunctival squamous carcinoma. PURPOSE: To describe the authors' technique and preliminary results using electron beam radiation as rescue therapy for recalcitrant squamous cell carcinoma of the conjunctiva and cornea.
METHODS: A retrospective review comprised of an interventional case series of patients with pathologically confirmed diagnosis of squamous cell carcinoma of the conjunctiva and cornea, who had failed multiple standard treatments and underwent electron beam radiation therapy. Outcomes, radiation-related complications, and adverse effects were documented. Mortality and local control rates were calculated by the Kaplan-Meier survival probability method.
RESULTS: Eight patients met the inclusion criteria; of these, 6 (75%) were men and 2 (25%) were women, with ages ranging from 38 to 65 years (mean 50 years). One tumor (12.5%) was classified as T2N0M0, 6 (75%) were classified as T3N0M0, and one (12.5%) was classified as T4N0M0. Follow up from electron beam radiation therapy ranged from 3 to 72 months (mean 30.25 months). The most common side effect was erythema and edema of the eyelids with diffuse transient eyelash loss, seen in all patients. Tumor local control and regression after electron beam radiation therapy were noted in 6 patients (75%); recurrence was noted in 2. There was neither metastatic spread nor tumor-related deaths.
CONCLUSIONS: The authors report a small case series where local tumor control was achieved with electron beam radiation therapy for recalcitrant squamous cell carcinoma of the conjunctiva and cornea. This approach may be considered for patients who fail conventional therapy.",Excluded
1204,"Carcinoma of the larynx treated with hypofractionated radiation and hyperbaric oxygen: Long-term tumor control and complications. Purpose: To evaluate the long-term outcome with respect to local control, survival, and complications in a cohort of patients with locally advanced laryngeal carcinoma treated with hypofractionated radiation and hyperbaric oxygen at 4 atmospheres of pressure (HBO-4). Methods and Materials: Between January 1970 and August 1982, 45 patients with locally advanced carcinoma of the larynx were treated with primary radiation using a unique hypofractionated schedule of 2 fractions of 11 Gy separated by 21 days, with concomitant HBO-4 during each radiotherapy session. To avoid seizures, discomfort and other complications of HBO-4, each session was performed under general anesthesia. All patients had pathologically confirmed squamous cell carcinoma of the glottic (23) or supraglottic larynx (22) and were staged as follows: T2-5, T3-24, T-4-16; N0-26, N1-4, N2-13, N3-1. Patients were treated with opposed lateral wedged fields of 4-6MV photons, with a median field size of 5.5 x 9.75 to a total median dose of 22.5 Gy. Result(s): As of February 1998, follow-up was complete on all but one patient, who relocated to another country after 8 years. Complete clinical responses were observed in 39 (87%) of the cases. The 10-year local control rate for all 45 patients was 58%, and local control for the complete responders was 69%. Three patients underwent laryngectomy for complications and were found to have no pathological evidence of disease in the laryngectomy specimen. The 10-year survival of the overall population was 27%. The 10-year voice preservation rate for the the 39 complete responders was 55%. Acute mucosal and skin reactions were modest and acceptable. Significant late complications occurred in 14 patients consisting of severe fibrosis, necrosis, pharyngeal fistula, with 3 patients requiring laryngectomy for complications. The actuarial rate of severe complications at 5 years was 42%. Conclusion(s): The response rate and long-term tumor control rate obtained with this treatment program were comparable to more protracted radiation schedules with or without systemic chemotherapy. The complication rate was high resulting in an adverse therapeutic ratio. The radiobiologic interpretation of this clinical data, and implications for hypoxia directed therapy, are discussed.",Excluded
1124,"Correlation between ultraviolet radiation level and the incidence of late-onset corneal haze after photorefractive keratectomy. PURPOSE: To investigate the correlation between environmental changes in ultraviolet (UV) radiation levels and the incidence of late-onset cornea haze (LOCH) after photorefractive keratectomy (PRK)., SETTING: SynsLaser Clinic, Tromso, Norway., METHODS: The study comprised 404 eyes that had myopic PRK and photoastigmatic refractive keratectomy from February 1996 through July 1998. The high latitude (70 degrees N) of the observation site provided natural laboratory"" conditions to look at the occurrence of LOCH with high and low UV-radiation levels, which occurred during summers and winters, respectively. The diagnostic criterion for LOCH was acute haze of grade > or =2 occurring between 4 and 12 months postoperatively., RESULTS: The follow-up ranged from 12 to 41 months. Of the 314 eyes that met the inclusion criteria, 11 developed LOCH when the environmental UV-radiation level was high. No eye developed LOCH when the level was low. The correlation between a high level of environmental UV radiation and the occurrence of LOCH was statistically significant (P =.001)., CONCLUSION: Environments with high UV-radiation levels may increase the risk of LOCH after PRK in eyes with moderate to high myopia. Use of UV-protective eyewear should be encouraged during the first year after PRK.""",Excluded
2160,"The effect of diode laser on the candida albicans colonization in complete denture wearers. Aim: To investigate the effect of diode laser on the Candida albicans colonization in complete denture patients. Method(s): A total of 40 complete maxillary dentures wearers studied in this cross-sectional study. Dentures were then randomly divided into two groups. In first group as the control group no intervention was made. Dentures of the second group merely exposed to laser irradiation by the diode laser with wavelength of 940 nm with 100mW for 30 seconds on mucosal surface of dentures before delivery. Samples were collected from the mucosal surface of upper dentures on the determined days. All collected colonies were counted. Clinical outcome was evaluated regarding the colonization of Candida albicans reported by CFU. Difference of colony counts results between two groups was evaluated by Mann-Whitney test. Statistical significance was assumed if p<0.05. Result(s): The results showed laser irradiation was significantly effective in reducing candida colonization. The lower density of the colonies was seen in laser group in compare with control group on 15th and 60th days after denture delivery (P=0.002) & (P=0.003), respectively. Conclusion(s): generalization our data into the clinical setting, it can be proposed that a direct laser-based approach can significantly reduce the colonization of Candida albicans. It can also be concluded that laser light at specific wavelengths could be a possible promising novel strategy for prevention of denture stomatitis.Copyright © 2021 Lahore Medical And Dental College.

3401,"Outcomes of rectal cancer with liver oligometastases. Purpose: In patients with oligometastatic colorectal cancer to the liver, long term survival is possible and a multi-modality treatment approach may be considered. This is a report of a single institution experience of oligometastatic rectal cancer patients after treatment of the primary tumor and pelvic lymph nodes with extended course chemoradiation therapy. Method(s): Between 2004 and 2013, 26 oligometastatic rectal cancer patients with liver metastases were treated with extended course chemoradiation at our institution followed by total mesorectal excision (TME). Amongst these there were 17 men and 9 women. The mean age at the time of diagnosis was 59.8 years, with a range from 36 to 87 years of age. Eleven patients had metastases in other sites in addition to liver, and one patient in our cohort had lung metastasis with no liver metastasis. Kaplan-Meier method was used to generate overall survival (OS), progression free survival (PFS), distant metastases (DM) and local control (LC). Result(s): OS rates were 95%, and 70% at 12 and 24 months respectively, with a mean survival time of 40.5 months. PFS rates were 91% and 36% at 12 and 24 months respectively, with a mean PFS time of 23.1 months. LC rates were 91% and 66% at 12 and 24 months respectively. DM rates were 0% and 61% at 12 and 24 months respectively. Finally, when censoring deaths, progression of liver metastases and distant progression, Kaplan-Meier analysis demonstrated five events of local failure. Conclusion(s): This series demonstrated an OS of 70% at 24 months, with a mean survival of 40.5 months. Significantly, LC was only 66% despite the use of extended course chemoradiation and TME. This data suggests that many patients with oligometastatic rectal cancer will survive past 2 years, and that a substantial number will fail locally as well as distantly. Therefore, a multimodality approach is reasonable. Recent data suggests that a hypofractionated radiation regiment of 25 Gy in 5 Gy fractions allows an equivalent LC compared to extended course chemoradiation with 50.4 Gy in 1.8 Gy fractions. A short course of radiation may be more consistent with the goals of care of the oligometastatic rectal cancer patient who is at high risk of recurrence.Copyright © Pioneer Bioscience Publishing Company.",Excluded

PURPOSE: A high-pitch dual-source CT (DSCT) was compared to a standard single-source CT protocol in terms of dose and image quality for malignant lymphoma staging., MATERIALS AND METHODS: Data from 43 patients who underwent DSCT (group 1) of the neck for staging of malignant lymphoma and 40 patients who underwent regular single source CT (group 2) were investigated retrospectively. Volume CT dose index (CTDIvol), dose length product (DLP), background noise (BN), attenuation values, signal-to-noise-ratio (SNR), scan time, effective tube current-time product (eff. mAs), subjective diagnostic image quality and artifact burden were compared., RESULTS: CTDIvol (5.5 +/- 0.8 mGy vs. 12.4 +/- 1.4 mGy), DLP (172 +/- 27 mGycm vs. 344 +/- 60 mGycm, p<0.0001), eff. mAs (98 +/- 15 mAs vs. 183 +/- 20 mAs, p<0.0001) and scan time (0.64 +/- 0.05 s vs. 8.21 +/- 0.72 s) were lower for group 1. BN was higher (p<0.001) for group 1 with a mean difference of 2.6 HU. SNR for sternocleidomastoid and pectoral muscle was lower (6.6-12.3 vs. 7.8-19.1) for group 1. Subjective image quality (1.55 +/- 0.6 vs. 1.42 +/- 0.5) and artifact burden (1.62 +/- 1.0 vs. 1.57 +/- 0.9) were not rated significantly different (p=0.47 and p=0.80) with a good inter-observer agreement (kappa=0.59-0.90)., CONCLUSION: High-pitch DSCT allows reduction of patient dose for cervical lymphoma staging while diagnostic image quality is preserved.

1668,"High expression of Rad51c predicts poor prognostic outcome and induces cell resistance to cisplatin and radiation in non-small cell lung cancer. Rad51c is critical for homologous recombination repair and genomic stability and may play roles in tumorigenesis and cancer therapy. We investigated the expression level and clinical significance of Rad51c in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and determined the effect of Rad51c on NSCLC cell chemosensitivity and radiosensitivity. Rad51c expression was detected using immunohistochemistry and was higher in NSCLC patient samples than in adjacent normal tissues. Kaplan-Meier analysis revealed that high Rad51c expression was an independent predictor of short overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS) in NSCLC patients receiving chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy. Furthermore, Rad51c knockdown increased the killing effect of ionizing radiation (IR) and enhanced cisplatin-induced apoptotic cells in NSCLC cells by disrupting the repair of cisplatin- and IR-induced DNA damage. In addition, ectopic expression of Rad51c dramatically enhanced NSCLC cell resistance to cisplatin and radiotherapy. These findings suggest that increased expression of Rad51c may confer resistance to chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy of NSCLC, and also be an independent prognostic factor for patient outcome. Therefore, targeting Rad51c may represent an improved therapeutic strategy for NSCLC patients with locally advanced disease.Copyright © 2016, International Society of Oncology and BioMarkers (ISOBM).",Excluded
679,"Factors influencing the release of volatiles in Anastrepha obliqua males (Diptera: Tephritidae). During sexual signaling, males of Anastrepha obliqua (Macquart) form leks and attract females by producing sounds and releasing volatile compounds. The objective of this study was to investigate the influence time of time of day, age, irradiation, mating status, and the presence of host fruit on the release of volatile components by laboratory-reared A. obliqua males. A. obliqua males released four compounds identified by gas chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry (GC-MS) as (E,E)-alpha-farnesene, (Z,E)-alpha-farnesene, (Z)-3-nonenol, and a farnesene isomer during calling behavior. Although males released volatiles during the entire day, the amount of volatiles was higher in the early morning and afternoon hours. Males began to emit volatiles when they were 6 d old, but only the amount of (Z)-3-nonenol was affected by age. Irradiation of flies with gamma rays from a 60Co source at a dose rate of 80 [corrected] Gy significantly reduced the amount of volatiles released during calling behavior. The amount of volatiles was lower in recently mated males than virgin males. However, there were no significant differences between virgin males and males 24 h after mating. The presence of host fruit did not affect the amount of volatiles compared with the control.",Excluded
3638,"Electronic brachytherapy for superficial and nodular basal cell carcinoma: A report of two prospective pilot trials using different doses. Purpose: Basal cell carcinoma (BCC) is a very common cancer in the Caucasian population. Treatment aims to eradicate the tumor with the lowest possible functional and aesthetic impact. Electronic brachytherapy (EBT) is a treatment technique currently emerging. This study aims to show the outcomes of two consecutive prospective pilot clinical trials using different radiation doses of EBT with Esteya EB system for the treatment of superficial and nodular basal cell carcinoma. Material(s) and Method(s): Two prospective, single-center, non-randomized, pilot studies were conducted. Twenty patients were treated in each study with different doses. The first group (1) was treated with 36.6 Gy in 6 fractions of 6.1 Gy, and the second group (2) with 42 Gy in 6 fractions of 7 Gy. Cure rate, acute toxicity, and late toxicity related to cosmesis were analyzed in the two treatment groups. Result(s): In group 1, a complete response in 90% of cases was observed at the first year of follow-up, whereas in group 2, the complete response was 95%. The differences with reference to acute toxicity and the cosmetic results between the two treatment groups were not statistically significant. Conclusion(s): Our initial experience with Esteya EB system to treat superficial and nodular BCC shows that a dose of 36.6 Gy and 42 Gy delivered in 6 fraction of 7 Gy achieves a 90% and 95% clinical cure rate at 1 year, respectively. Both groups had a tolerable toxicity and a very good cosmesis. The role of EBT in the treatment of BCC is still to be defined. It will probably become an established option for selected patients in the near future.Copyright © 2016, Termedia Publishing House Ltd. All rights reserved.",Excluded

METHOD(S): The experimental animals were whole-body exposed to microwave radiation with frequency of 2,450 MHz, power density of 1, 5, 15 mW/cm(2) respectively 1 h everyday for 30 days. Then the thymus were taken out after the mice were decapitated. Thymus index, morphological characteristics of thymus were examined. The changes of thymus T-cell subgroups, cell cycle progression in thymocytes and cellular apoptosis were detected with flow cytometry (FCM). RESULT(S): The body weights of animals in 5, 15 mW/cm(2) irradiation groups [(28.10 +/- 1.46), (27.50 +/- 2.52) g] were lower than that of the control [(31.95 +/- 2.51) g] (P < 0.05). Pathological observation showed dark red piece of nucleus, some nuclei inclined to one side, slight increase in hassall body. The expressions of CD8 in 5, 15 mW/cm(2) irradiation groups (29.14% +/- 1.68%, 29.18% +/- 0.81%) were higher than that in control group (26.95% +/- 1.27%) (P < 0.05). The percentages of G(2) + M phase thymocytes in both radiation groups (12.24% +/- 1.82%, 11.19% +/- 1.36%) were lower than that in control group (14.58% +/- 0.64%) (P < 0.01). Thymocytic apoptosis rates in the three experimental groups (7.18% +/- 0.99%, 10.06% +/- 1.58%, 9.45% +/- 0.92%) were higher than that in control (4.25% +/- 1.63%) (P < 0.01), but the evident difference between 5 mW/cm(2) and 15 mW/cm(2) was not found (P > 0.05).

In orthopaedics and traumatology allogeneic grafting has been used to restore defects of osseous tissue for over 60 years. In order to improve safety of the graft recipient, sterilized allogeneic grafts have been use. The aim of the study was to assess the direct and long-term outcomes following augmentation of atrophied alveolar processes with the use of radiation-sterilized allogeneic bone grafts. Sixty-eight patients were surgically treated between 2004 and 2011: 29 underwent open sinus floor elevation, post-extraction alveoli augmentation was performed in 16 subjects and 23 underwent reconstruction of the atrophied alveolar process. Augmentation of bone defects used bone granulate in 63 patients and bone blocks stabilized with titanium screws in 5 patients. PRF membranes collected from the patient's blood were also used in all the procedures. In each of the cases optimal dimensions of the alveolar process were obtained allowing embedment of BIOMET 3I dental implant/-s.

Thermosensitive hydrogels are of a great interest due to their many biomedical and pharmaceutical applications. In this study, we synthesized a new series of random poly (methyl vinyl ether-co-maleic anhydride) (Gantrez( R) AN, GZ) and Pluronic( R) F127 (PF127) copolymers (GZ-PF127), that formed thermosensitive hydrogels whose gelation temperature and mechanical properties could be controlled by the molar ratio of GZ and PF127 polymers and the copolymer concentration in water. Gelation temperatures tended to decrease when the GZm/PF127 ratio increased. Thus, at a fixed GZm/PF127 value, sol-gel temperatures decreased at higher copolymer concentrations. Moreover, these hydrogels controlled the release of proteins such as bovine serum albumin (BSA) and recombinant recombinant kinetoplastid membrane protein of Leishmania (rKMP-11) more than the PF127 system. Toxicity studies carried out in J774.2 macrophages showed that cell viability was higher than 80%. Finally, histopathological analysis revealed that subcutaneous administration of low volumes of these hydrogels elicited a tolerable inflammatory response that could be useful to induce immune responses against the protein cargo in the development of vaccine adjuvants.

797,"Quantification of the chromosomal radiation damage induced by labelling of leukocytes with [18F]FDG. Introduction: The aim of our work is to quantify the radiation damage in lymphocytes after labelling with [18F]FDG. Comparison with gold standard [99mTc]HMPAO labelling is established. An approach to cellular dosimetry is proposed. Method(s): Mixed leukocytes were separated from fresh venous blood and labelled with [18F]FDG and [99mTc]HMPAO following published guidelines. Cytokinesis-block micronucleus (CBMN) assay was performed for both sets of experiments. Tests for quality control of labelling described in guidelines were followed. Cellular dosimetry was calculated according to MIRD. Result(s): MN scored after labelling with 37. MBq of [18F]FDG were 956 +/- 172 and 347 +/- 26 for [99mTc]HMPAO (p < 0.05). Absorbed dose in cell nucleus was of 0.23. Gy for [18F]FDG and 0.08. Gy for [99mTc]HMPAO labelling. The CBMN assay after labelling with ~ 290 MBq of [18F]FDG showed radiation induced inhibition of proliferation capacity of the lymphocytes, confirmed by proliferation study. Conclusion(s): [18F]FDG labelling of mixed leukocytes causes severe radiation damage to the cell, higher than with [99mTc]HMPAO in accordance with the absorbed dose. Labelling of mixed leukocytes for clinical purpose induces high cytotoxicity reflected in the loss of proliferation capacity in lymphocytes this statement allows us to consider a low oncogenic risk however the association between MN formation in the PBL and subsequent risk of cancer is not well established. Advances in knowledge: This is the first work about radiation damage with [18F]FDG labelled cells. We focused on [18F]FDG labelling of leukocytes due to the growing number of research and review articles about this technique. Implications for patient care: The possibility of an increased risk of lymphoid malignancies associated with the administration of radiolabelled lymphocytes is a very controversial subject. Studies on radiation damage on new labelling procedures as the one exposed in this work must be considered.Copyright © 2015 Elsevier Inc..",Excluded

PURPOSE: To define the diagnostic precision of non-specialized readers in the detection of type 2 endoleaks (T2EL) in arterial versus venous phase acquisitions, and to evaluate an approach for radiation dose reduction., METHODS: The pre-discharge and final follow-up multi-slice CT angiographies of 167 patients were retrospectively analyzed. Image data were separated into an arterial and a venous phase reading set. Two radiology residents assessed the reading sets for the presence of a T2EL, feeding vessels, and aneurysm sac size. Findings were compared with a standard of reference established by two experts in interventional radiology. The effective dose was calculated., RESULTS: Overall, experts detected 131 T2ELs, and 331 feeding vessels in 334 examinations. Persistent T2ELs causing aneurysm sac growth > 5 mm were detected in 20 patients. Radiation in arterial and venous phases contributed to a mean of 58.6% and 39.0% of the total effective dose. Findings of reader 1 and 2 showed comparable sensitivities in arterial sets of 80.9 versus 85.5 (p = 0.09), and in venous sets of 73.3 versus 79.4 (p = 0.15), respectively. Reader 1 and 2 achieved a significant higher detection rate of feeding vessels with arterial compared to venous set (p = 0.04, p < 0.01). Both readers correctly identified T2ELs with growing aneurysm sac in all cases, independent of the acquisition phase., CONCLUSION: Arterial acquisitions enable non-specialized readers an accurate detection of T2ELs, and a significant better identification of feeding vessels.

Methods and Materials: Definitive RT was performed on 115 patients with oral cavity cancers at Stages III, IVA, and IVB, with a distribution of 6%, 47%, and 47%, respectively. The median dose of RT was 72Gy (range, 62-76Gy). Cisplatin-based chemotherapy was administered to 95% of the patients. Eleven patients underwent salvage surgery after RT failure. Result(s): Eight-eight (76.5%) patients responded partially and 23 (20%) completely; of the patients who responded, 18% and 57%, respectively, experienced a durable effect of treatment. The 3-year overall survival, disease-specific survival, and progression-free survival were 22%, 27%, and 25%, respectively. The 3-year PFS rates based on the primary tumor sites were as follows: Group I (buccal, mouth floor, and gum) 51%, Group II (retromolar and hard palate) 18%, and Group III (tongue and lip) 6% (p < 0.0001). The 3-year progression-free survival was 41% for N0 patients and 19% for patients with N+ disease (p = 0.012). The T stage and RT technique did not affect survival.

1501,"Primary Tumour Resection Could Improve the Survival of Unresectable Metastatic Colorectal Cancer Patients Receiving Bevacizumab-Containing Chemotherapy. BACKGROUND: The effect of primary tumour resection (PTR) among metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) patients remains controversial. Combination chemotherapy with bevacizumab could improve the clinical outcomes of these patients, which might change the importance of PTR in the multi-disciplinary treatment pattern., METHODS: We performed a non-randomized prospective controlled study of mCRC pts whose performance status (PS) scored <=2 and who received bevacizumab combination chemotherapy (FOLFOX/XELOX/FOLFIRI) as a first-line therapy. These patients were classified into the PTR group and the IPT (intact primary tumour) group according to whether they underwent PTR before receiving the systemic therapy. The progression free survival (PFS) time and overall survival (OS) time, which were recorded from the start of the primary diagnosis until disease progression and death or last follow-up, were analysed. We also compared severe clinical events (such as emergency surgery, radiation therapy, and stent plantation) between the two groups., RESULTS: One hundred and nighty-one mCRC pts (108 male patients and 93 female patients) were entered in this prospective observational study. The median age was 57.5 years old. The clinical characteristics (age, gender, performance status, primary tumour site, RAS status, and the number of metastatic organs) did not significantly differ between the two groups. The median PFS and OS times of the PTR group were superior than those of the IPT group (10.0 vs 7.8 months, p < 0.01 and 22.5 vs 17.8 months, p < 0.01, respectively). The incidences of adverse events associated with systemic therapy were similar between the two groups. Specifically, sixteen patients (21.9%, 16/73) with IPT developed significant primary tumour-related complications, such as bleeding, obstruction or even perforation. Among these patients, five underwent emergency surgery, three patients received a stent, and eight patients underwent radiation therapy., CONCLUSIONS: The mCRC patients who received PTR and bevacizumab combination chemotherapy had better clinical outcomes than patients who did not receive PTR. PTR also decreased the incidence of severe clinical events and improved quality of life. Copyright © 2016 The Author(s) Published by S. Karger AG, Basel.",Excluded

PURPOSE: This study aimed to explore the predictive value of systematic inflammatory and metabolic markers in head and neck (H&N) cancer patients during radiotherapy (RT)., METHODS: Twenty-seven patients were evaluated. The protocol included serial blood tests [highly sensitive C-reactive protein (hsCRP), albumin, insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1), IGF binding protein 1 (IGFBP-1) and ghrelin], measurements of body weight and assessment of oral mucositis., RESULTS: The mean nadir of weight loss was observed at the end of RT. At the time of diagnosis, mean hsCRP was 5.2 +/- 1.0 mg/L. HsCRP significantly increased during RT and decreased during the post-RT period. Mean maximum hsCRP was 35.8 +/- 8.5 mg/L, with seven patients reaching >40 mg/L. A numerical decrease of albumin (by 18.2%) and only small changes in IGF-1, IGFBP-1 and ghrelin levels were observed. None of the metabolic parameters was significantly associated with weight loss., CONCLUSIONS: HsCRP increased in response to RT for H&N cancer as a sign of irradiation-induced inflammation. Weight loss was not preceded by changes of the metabolic parameters, indicating that assessment of the blood markers used in this study is of little value. Regular body weight measurement and assessment of oral mucositis are feasible, cheap and important procedures to control the metabolic homeostasis during RT.",Excluded

Respondents considered diet to be a relatively unimportant factor in cancer causation, whereas they viewed sun exposure, genetics/family history, and radiation exposure as large contributors to the cancer burden. Among cancer early detection tests, high activity was shown for the Pap test and breast examination. Conversely, low activity was reported for colon sigmoidoscopy. Inverse correlations were shown between age group of the physician and several cancer prevention and early detection practices. For each cancer prevention and screening practice, reported activity was higher for medical doctors than for doctors of osteopathic medicine. Possible barriers or controversies in cancer control included disagreement with the current recommendation for Pap testing, the cost of mammography, and patient fear of sigmoidoscopy. These findings suggest that primary care physicians are not achieving their full potential in cancer control and indicate areas where increased emphasis is warranted.",Excluded
2815,"Transition to radial approach for neurovascular procedures is safe and convenient: Characterization of a learning experience. BACKGROUND: The transradial access for endovascular procedures has become a popular access point of preference for both patients and for many neuro-endovascular practitioners. OBJECTIVE(S): To describe a single-center experience on the transition to a radial-first approach for neurovascular procedures, focused on diagnostic angiographies, and to compare the differences in terms of length of procedure within the first 5 mo of its execution. METHOD(S): We performed a retrospective review of a prospective maintained cerebrovascular registry at an academic institution within the United States, to identify the expected adoption curve required to transition to a transradial route first approach focused mainly on diagnostic procedures. The 5 mo of experience were divided into 4 quartiles evenly distributed in time. The primary outcome was the total length of procedure. Secondary outcomes were access failure, radiation dose, the usefulness of ultrasound assistance and complications. RESULT(S): A total of 121 transradial procedures were performed: 113 diagnostic angiographies (93%) and 8 therapeutic interventions (7%). We identified 6 access failures (5%) and 1 complication (1%). The mean length for diagnostic angiographies was 24 +/- 10 min, and for therapeutic procedures was 58 +/- 19 min. A multivariate regression analysis demonstrated a significant decrease in the total length of procedures after the first quartile. CONCLUSION(S): The transradial route shows to be a safe and convenient approach. The total length of procedure starts decreasing as providers gain experience and become more confident with this route, as seen in our 5-mo experience.Copyright © 2020 by the Congress of Neurological Surgeons",Excluded
1138,"A Prospective Trial of Radiation Therapy Efficacy and Toxicity for Localized Mucosa-associated Lymphoid Tissue (MALT) Lymphoma. Purpose: We report the long-term results of a prospective trial conducted to determine the efficacy and safety of radiation therapy (RT) alone in treating localized mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) lymphoma. Methods and Materials: Patients with localized MALT lymphoma were eligible and treated with involved field RT to doses of 24 to 39.6 Gy. Relapse-free survival (RFS) was the primary endpoint. Kaplan-Meier analysis was used to estimate RFS, progression-free survival (PFS), and overall survival (OS) defined from time of study entry. Preplanned subgroup analyses were performed based on site of involvement. Result(s): From 2000 to 2012, 75 patients were accrued; 73 received protocol-specified RT. Median follow-up was 9.8 years. Thirty-four patients had gastric MALT, 17 orbital, 13 head and neck nonorbit, 4 skin, and 5 disease of other sites. Thirteen of 34 patients with gastric MALT were Helicobacter pylori positive at the time of initial diagnosis and underwent 1 to 3 courses of triple antibiotic therapy. All gastric MALT patients had documented persistent MALT without H. pylori on endoscopy before enrollment in the study. All patients achieved a complete response with a median time of 3 months. Eleven patients (15%) had disease relapse, 9 of which were at sites outside the RT field with median time to progression of 38.3 months. Median PFS was 17.5 years, and median RFS and OS were not reached. The 10-year relapse-free rate was 83% (95% confidence interval [CI], 74%-93%). The 10-year PFS rate was 71% (95% CI, 60%-84%). The 10-year OS rate was 86% (95% CI, 77%-96%). RFS, PFS, and OS did not differ by disease site (P = .17,. 43, and. 50, respectively). All relapses were successfully salvaged. One patient developed metastatic gastric adenocarcinoma and was found to also have recurrent MALT on biopsy. Otherwise, all relapsed patients were alive without evidence of disease at last follow-up, and no patient died of MALT lymphoma. Sixty-seven patients (92%) experienced acute toxicity during radiation, all of which were grade 1 and 2, with only 1 grade 3 toxicity. Twenty-two patients (30%) experienced late toxicity, with only 1 grade 3 toxicity. Conclusion(s): This prospective study confirms that RT for MALT lymphoma provides excellent long-term RFS with acceptable rates of toxicity. Current efforts are focused on RT de-escalation in an effort to further avoid treatment-related morbidity. Clinicaltrials.gov: NCT04465162.Copyright © 2020",Excluded
1531,"Ventilatory inhomogeneity determined from multiple-breath washouts during sustained microgravity on Spacelab SLS-1. We used multiple-breath N2 washouts (MBNW) to study the inhomogeneity of ventilation in four normal humans (mean age 42.5 yr) before, during, and after 9 days of exposure to microgravity on Spacelab Life Sciences-1. Subjects performed 20-breath MBNW at tidal volumes of approximately 700 ml and 12-breath MBNW at tidal volumes of approximately 1,250 ml. Six indexes of ventilatory inhomogeneity were derived from data from 1) distribution of specific ventilation (SV) from mixed-expired and 2) end-tidal N2, 3) change of slope of N2 washout (semilog plot) with time, 4) change of slope of normalized phase III of successive breaths, 5) anatomic dead space, and 6) Bohr dead space. Significant ventilatory inhomogeneity was seen in the standing position at normal gravity (1 G). When we compared standing 1 G with microgravity, the distributions of SV became slightly narrower, but the difference was not significant. Also, there were no significant changes in the change of slope of the N2 washout, change of normalized phase III slopes, or the anatomic and Bohr dead spaces. By contrast, transition from the standing to supine position in 1 G resulted in significantly broader distributions of SV (P < 0.05) and significantly greater changes in the changes in slope of the N2 washouts (P < 0.001), indicating more ventilatory inhomogeneity in that posture. Thus these techniques can detect relatively small changes in ventilatory inhomogeneity. We conclude that the primary determinants of ventilatory inhomogeneity during tidal breathing in the upright posture are not gravitational in origin.",Excluded
1214,"CT fluoroscopy-guided percutaneous gastrostomy with loop gastropexy and peel-away sheath trocar technique in 31 amyotrophic lateral sclerosis patients. Background: In amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) patients with respiratory impairment and/or advanced disease, performing even mild sedation - as is usually necessary for percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) placements - is fraught with risk. These patients are often referred to Interventional Radiology for alternative percutaneous gastrostomy tube placement options. Purpose: To report our experience with CT fluoroscopy-guided percutaneous gastrostomy with a novel loop gastropexy and peel-away sheath trocar technique in ALS patients as an alternative to endoscopic techniques. Material and Methods: A consecutive series of 31 amyotrophic lateral sclerosis patients in whom endoscopic gastrostomy was considered too dangerous or impossible to perform underwent CT-guided percutaneous gastropexy and gastrostomy and prospective follow-up. All procedures were performed with a 15 FR Frekaw Pexact gastrostomy kit, a 16-row CT scanner (Aquilion 16) and single shot CT fluoroscopy mode. Results: The procedure was performed successfully in 30 of 31 patients (20 men, 11 women; median age 60 years, range 38-80 years). In the remaining case the stomach was punctured under CT fluoroscopy and CO2 insufflation was initiated thereafter, leading to successful gastrostomy without prior gastropexy and without further adverse events during follow-up. Two patients reported unproblematic exchange of a balloon tube due to skin irritations with no further adverse events. One patient reported accidental displacement of an exchanged new balloon tube in domestic environment due to balloon leakage: A new balloon tube was easily re-inserted in a hospital the same day. No serious adverse events such as peritonitis, persistent local bleeding, systemic blood loss, or any local infection requiring surgical intervention were observed. Until August 11, 2011 follow-up resulted in 7473 cumulative gastrostomy-days from the date of first placement. Conclusion: Initial results suggest that the described technique under CT guidance is feasible and safe and may especially be advantageous in cases where endoscopic gastrostomy and sedation are contraindicated.",Excluded
3382,"Comparing radiation exposure between ablative therapies for small renal masses. PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the amount of radiation exposure patients with small renal masses undergoing percutaneous cyroablation (PCA) or percutaneous radiofrequency ablation (PRFA) received during treatment and follow up., MATERIALS AND METHODS: A retrospective review was conducted on all patients with small renal masses <4 cm treated with PCA or PRFA over a 7-year period in a single academic center. Preoperative, operative, and post-operative variables were collected and compared. Radiation exposure received during treatment and 1 year of follow up were also determined for each modality. Statistical analysis was conducted using SPSS V.17 (SPSS, Chicago, IL). The groups were compared using the Mann-Whitney U and Pearson Chi-Square tests. Statistical significance was considered at p<0.05., RESULTS: There was no significant difference in pretreatment parameters or oncologic outcomes. The average PCA treatment radiation exposure was 39.7 mSv (15.5-133.4 mSv) compared with 22.2 mSv (8.1-67.7 mSv) for PRFA (p=0.001). During the initial year after treatment, the estimated mean treatment and follow-up radiation exposure for PCA was 134.5 mSv, compared with 117 mSv for RFA when routine computerized tomography imaging was employed., CONCLUSION: To our knowledge, this is the first published study that quantifies radiation exposure in PCA and PRFA treatment for small renal masses. These relatively high radiation exposures should be included in the informed consent for these procedures. In addition, caution should be employed when applying these technologies in young patients who are most susceptible to long-term radiation damage.",Excluded
1442,"Neoadjuvant radiotherapy for rectal cancer: adherence to evidence-based guidelines in clinical practice. Implementation of evidence-based standards is problematic. Level 1 evidence, largely predicated on the German Rectal Cancer Study, supports neoadjuvant treatment for patients with stage II/III rectal cancer. The purpose of this study was to determine to what extent this evidence has affected clinical practice. Stage II/III rectal cancer patients undergoing surgery from 1998 to 2007 were identified in the SEER tumor registry. Variables were analyzed with SPSS software. Trends were evaluated with regression models. Survivals were compared with the log-rank test. A total of 22,136 patients were identified and 15,021 (67.8%) were treated with adjuvant radiotherapy. A large percentage were >60 years old (64.4%), white (83.0%), male (58.8%), at stage III (55.1%), and treated with neoadjuvant radiotherapy (35.5%). A significant increase in the use of neoadjuvant radiotherapy occurred: from 17% in 1998 to 51% in 2007 (p < 0.001). Scatter-plot best-fit lines for neoadjuvant and adjuvant radiotherapy intersected at approximately year 2002. Significant increases in preoperative radiotherapy were observed for all races and cancer stages (p < 0.001). On unadjusted analysis, race (p = 0.018), sex (p < 0.001), year of diagnosis (p < 0.001), age (p < 0.001), and stage (p < 0.001) were associated with increased likelihood of neoadjuvant radiotherapy. On logistic regression analysis, male sex [odds ratio (OR) 1.14, p < 0.001), year (OR 1.223, p < 0.001), and stage II (OR 1.39, p < 0.001) were predictors of neoadjuvant therapy. When adjuvant radiotherapy was utilized, there was rapid adoption of a neoadjuvant approach. This trend predated publication of prospective randomized data.",Excluded
112,"Salivary gland-sparing other than parotid-sparing in definitive head-and-neck intensity-modulated radiotherapy does not seem to jeopardize local control. Background: The objective was to analyze locoregional (LR) failure patterns in patients with head-and-neck cancer (HNC) treated using intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) with whole salivary gland-sparing: parotid (PG), submandibular (SMG), and accessory salivary glands represented by the oral cavity (OC). Method(s): Seventy consecutive patients with Stage I-II (23%) or III/IV (77%) HNC treated by definitive IMRT were included. For all LR failure patients, the FDG-PET and CT scans documenting recurrence were rigidly registered to the initial treatment planning CT. Failure volumes (Vf) were delineated based on clinical, radiological, and histological data. The percentage of Vf covered by 95% of the prescription isodose (Vf-V95) was analyzed. Failures were classified as "" in-field"" if Vf-V95 >= 95%, "" marginal"" if 20% < Vf-V95 < 95%, and "" out-of-field"" if Vf-V95 <=20%. Correlation between Vf-V95 and mean doses (Dmean) in the PG, SMG, and OC was assessed using Spearman's rank-order correlation test. The salivary gland dose impact on the LR recurrence risk was assessed by Cox analysis. Result(s): The median follow-up was 20 months (6-35). Contralateral and ipsilateral PGs were spared in 98% and 54% of patients, respectively, and contralateral and ipsilateral SMG in 26% and 7%, respectively. The OC was spared to a dose <=40 Gy in 26 patients (37%). The 2-year LR control rate was 76.5%. One recurrence was "" marginal"" , and 12 were "" in-field"" No recurrence was observed in vicinity of spared structures. Vf-V95 was not significantly correlated with Dmean in PG, SMG, and OC. The LR recurrence risk was not increased by lower Dmean in the salivary glands, but by T (p = 0.04) and N stages (p = 0.03). Conclusion(s): Over 92% of LR failures occurred "" in-field"" within the high dose region when using IMRT with a whole salivary gland-sparing strategy. Sparing SMG and OC in addition to PG thus appears a safe strategy. © 2013 Chajon et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",Excluded
1738,"Three-dimensional anatomic analysis and navigation templates for C1 pedicle screw placement perpendicular to the coronal plane: a retrospective study. OBJECTIVE: To explore the corridor for atlas pedicle screw placement perpendicular to the coronal plane and to develop patient-specific navigation templates for pedicle screw placement., METHODS: This study is a retrospective analysis. A total of 71 patients (41 males and 30 females) were involved in this study from June 2016 to June 2018, and they were divided into a template group (39 patients) and a conventional group (32 patients). The CT-based 3D reconstruction models were analyzed in the template group. From the perspective of the 3D atlas in a coronal view, the pedicle corridor was obtained. Taking the center of the tangential circle of the pedicle as the entry point, we simulated screw placement perpendicular to the coronal plane. Then, the individual navigation template was designed and used in surgery. In the conventional group, free-hand pedicle screw placement was performed perpendicular to the coronal plane. The diameter of the maximum tangential circle and screw length of the pedicle corridor were measured in the template group. The surgical time, radiation exposure time, screw grading criteria and so on were evaluated and compared between the two groups after surgery., RESULTS: ;The diameter of the maximum tangential circle and the distance between the entry point and posterior tubercle were significantly greater in males than in females. The operation was successfully completed in all patients, without aggravation of nerve injury, and the follow-up was 12-20 months, with an average of 15.6 months. A total of 78 screws were inserted in the template group, and 64 screws were inserted in the conventional group. The surgical times in the template group and conventional group were 76.47+/-24.44 min and 125.63+/-36.41 min, respectively. The radiation exposure times in the template group and conventional group were 3.51+/-1.77 and 10.15+/-4.95, respectively, and there was a significant difference between the two groups. In the template group, the deviation in the screw entry point and screw angle were 1.92+/-1.67 mm and 2.08+/-1.98degree, respectively. The medial angle deviation between the left and right sides was 2.71+/-1.88degree in the template group, which was significantly less than the deviation of 3.76+/-2.22degree in the conventional group., CONCLUSION: A pedicle screw trajectory perpendicular to the coronal plane can be quickly obtained based on the perspective of 3D models. The technique of screw placement perpendicular to the coronal plane assisted by navigation templates has a shorter operative time, lessintraoperative fluoroscopy and a higher safety of screw placement than traditional surgery.",Excluded
127,"Treatment of posterolateral tibial plateau fractures with a rotational support plate and special pressurizer: technical note and retrospective case series. BACKGROUND: In tibial plateau fractures, the posterolateral segment of the tibia plateau is frequently affected and challenging to treat. Although there are many surgical approaches and fixation methods for the treatment of these fractures, all of these methods have limitations. We designed a new rotational support plate (RSP) and a special pressurizer that can fix the fracture directly via the anterolateral approach. This method is advantageous because it leads to little trauma, involves a simple operation, and has a reliable fixation effect. This study details the technique of treating these fractures with the RSP and special pressurizer and provides the outcomes. METHOD(S): From May 2016 to January 2019, the data of 12 patients with posterolateral tibial plateau fractures treated with the RSP and special pressurizer in our hospital were retrospectively analyzed. Postoperative rehabilitation was advised, knee X-rays were taken at follow-ups, and fracture healing, complications, and knee range of motion were assessed. The Hospital for Special Surgery (HSS) knee score and Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS) were used to evaluate knee function at the last follow-up. RESULT(S): The average follow-up time of all patients was 16.5 months (range, 12-25 months). The average bony union time was 3.2 months (range, 3-4.5 months). At the last follow-up, the average knee range of motion was 138degree (range, 107-145degree). The average HSS score was 91 (range, 64-98). The average KOOS Symptoms score was 90 (range, 75-96). The average KOOS Pain score was 91 (range, 72-97). The average KOOS ADL score was 91 (range, 74-97). The average KOOS sport/recreation score was 83 (range, 70-90). The average KOOS QOL score was 88 (range, 69-93). Skin necrosis, incision infections, and fixation failure did not occur during the follow-up period. CONCLUSION(S): With our newly designed RSP and special pressurizer, posterolateral tibial plateau fractures can be easily and effectively reduced and fixed through the anterolateral approach, which serves as a novel treatment for posterolateral tibial plateau fractures.",Excluded
2414,"Different outdoor professions have different risks - a cross-sectional study comparing non-melanoma skin cancer risk among farmers, gardeners and mountain guides. Background: One of the main risk factors for non-melanoma skin cancer (NMSC), the most common cancer worldwide, is solar ultraviolet radiation (UVR). This has led to the recognition of NMSC as occupational disease for outdoor workers in several countries. However, outdoor professions are a very heterogeneous group with diverse daily activities and associated UVR exposure. Objective(s): To compare the prevalence of NMSC and associated risk behaviour in different outdoor professions. Method(s): Cross-sectional study among outdoor workers (farmers, gardeners, mountain guides) and indoor workers (office employees) as control group using a paper-based questionnaire on UVR exposure and protective behaviour followed by a skin examination by a dermatologist. Result(s): A total of 563 participants (46.9% women, 46.9 +/- 13.8 years) consisting of 348 outdoor workers (38.8% farmer, 35.3% gardener, 25.9% mountain guides) and 215 indoor workers were included in the study between March and September 2017. NMSC incl. actinic keratosis was diagnosed in 33.3% of mountain guides, 27.4% of farmers, 19.5% of gardeners and in 5.6% of indoor workers. Significant differences were seen between the outdoor professions with mountain guides at highest risk compared to farmers (OR = 2.6, 95% CI = 1.2-5.7). Substantial differences between the professions were also seen in skin cancer screening attendance rates (indoor worker 61.4%, mountain guides 57.8%, farmers 31.9%, gardeners 27.6%), daily UVR exposure during work and protective behaviour such as sunscreen use during work. Conclusion(s): Different outdoor professions have significant different risks for NMSC and show different risk behaviour. Tailoring prevention efforts to different professions based on their individual needs could be the key to lower the global burden of (occupational) NMSC.Copyright © 2018 European Academy of Dermatology and Venereology",Excluded

We retrospectively studied the 62 patients with primary lung cancer (56 males and 6 females) who were admitted to our department from January 1990 to December 1996. They were treated with radiation therapy (twice daily) for the chest, including the esophagus. The total radiation dose was 55.6Gy (mean). Esophagitis occurred in 48 patients (77%) after 29.7Gy (mean) of radiation. The symptoms of esophagitis included pharyngeal or chest pain, especially during swallowing. The incidence of esophagitis in the patients (n=46) who received chemotherapy before radiation was significantly higher than that in the patients (n=16) who did not receive it (87% vs. 50%; p<0.05). Esophagitis occurred in 22 (81%) among 27 patients who were given the preventive medicine. In spite of the optimal or supplemental administration of mucosal coating agents, esophagitis improved only in six patients (12%). Severe esophagitis was also observed in some patients, including two patients whose irradiation was terminated and one patient who was treated with intravenous hyperalimentation. Although radiation esophagitis is a very common complication in the treatment for lung cancer, it is refractory to usual treatments. Consequently, it is necessary to develop more effective prophylactic and treatment methods for radiation esophagitis.",Excluded
2349,"Iodine-131 treatment and chromosomal damage: in vivo dose-effect relationship. Although it is well known that radiation induces chromosomal aberrations, there is a lack of information on the in vivo dose-effect relationship in patients receiving iodine-131 treatment, and the results of previous studies are controversial. In this study, the sister chromatid exchange (SCE) method was employed to investigate acute and late chromosomal damage (CD) in the peripheral lymphocytes of 15 patients who received various doses of (131)I (259-3,700 MBq), either for thyrotoxicosis (TTX) or for ablation treatment in differentiated thyroid cancer (DTC). The SCE frequencies in cultured peripheral lymphocytes were determined before treatment (to assess basal SCE frequencies), on the 3rd day (to assess acute SCE frequencies) and 6 months later (to assess late SCE frequencies). The basal, acute and late SCE frequencies (mean+/-SD) were 3.19+/-0.93, 10.83+/-1.72 and 5.75+/-2.06, respectively, in the whole group, and these values differed significantly from each other ( P<0.001). In order to perform a quantitative evaluation of the present data and a comparative analysis with the results of previous studies reported in the literature, we defined acute and late effects using a ""damage ratio"" (DR) and a ""recovery ratio"" (RR), based on the basal, acute and late data for individual patients. No statistically significant difference was found in the DR between DTC and TTX patients (76.4%+/-11.5% vs 67.6%+/-9.0%), while the mean RR was higher in TTX patients than in the DTC group (75.2%+/-24.4% vs 36.8%+/-13.7%). The DR on the 3rd day was not related to the administered (131)I dose in the whole group, but a negative correlation was found between the (131)I dose and the RR at the 6th month (r=-0.60, P=0.04). The best fit for this relationship was obtained by a linear-quadratic model, as y=104.89x-28.4x(2)+38.1 ( R(2)=0.51, P=0.04). On the other hand, comparative analysis with the results of previous studies with comparable sampling times revealed that the best fit for the relationships between the administered dose of (131)I and DR and RR were obtained with a linear-quadratic model (Y=alpha D+beta D(2)) rather than a linear one. However, there was an interesting difference in comparison with in vitro studies, in that we found the coefficient beta to have a negative value, suggesting the disappearance of damaged lymphocytes from the peripheral circulation in a dose-dependent manner following (131)I treatment. Further studies are therefore needed to clarify the effect of the negative beta value on the biological dosimetry approach in continuous internal low LET radiation, as in the case of (131)I treatment.",Excluded

BACKGROUND: Total esophagectomy specimens from 4 patients given preoperative high dose rate intraluminal brachytherapy (HDRILBT) of 20 Gray (GY) in 2 fractions of 10 Gy each week were reviewed for radiation changes., METHODS: In all patients, preoperative biopsy specimens showed moderate to poorly differentiated squamous cell carcinoma with minimal to negligible keratin production. The esophagectomy specimens were sampled at the resection margins, the edge of irradiated length, 1 cm from the proximal and distal edge of visible tumor, the center of the tumor, and the lymph nodes., RESULTS: Radiation change in the form of fibrosis was limited to the submucosa at the resection margins, the circular muscle layer at the edge of irradiated length, and full thickness at 1 cm from the edge of the visible tumor and the center of the tumor. Surface epithelium did not show any changes at the resection margins but did show basal cell hyperplasia at the edge of the irradiated length and ulceration at 1 cm from the edge of the visible tumor and the center of the tumor. Endarteritis obliterans was seen only 1 cm from the edge of the visible tumor and the center of the tumor. Necrosis, intense keratin formation, and giant cell reaction were observed at the center of the tumor. When compared with the preradiotherapy biopsies, the amount of keratin in the postradiotherapy specimens was extensive. HDRILBT may cause induction of the keratin gene in the irradiated cells to stimulate differentiation toward better differentiated cells., CONCLUSIONS: HDRILBT may cause the keratin gene in the irradiated cells to induce differentiation toward better differentiated cells. Preoperative high dose rate intraluminal brachytherapy may have a role in improving the prognosis of patients with early esophageal cancer treated with a combination of radiotherapy and surgery.",Excluded
1851,"Randomized controlled trial of dietary fiber for the prevention of radiation-induced gastrointestinal toxicity during pelvic radiotherapy. Background: Therapeutic radiotherapy is an important treatment of pelvic cancers. Historically, low-fiber diets have been recommended despite a lack of evidence and potentially beneficial mechanisms of fiber. Objective(s): This randomized controlled trial compared low-, habitual-, and high-fiber diets for the prevention of gastrointestinal toxicity in patients undergoing pelvic radiotherapy. Design(s): Patients were randomly assigned to low-fiber [<=10 g nonstarch polysaccharide (NSP)/d], habitual-fiber (control), or high-fiber (>=18 g NSP/d) diets and received individualized counseling at the start of radiotherapy to achieve these targets. The primary endpoint was the difference between groups in the change in the Inflammatory Bowel Disease Questionnaire- Bowel Subset (IBDQ-B) score between the starting and nadir (worst) score during treatment. Other measures included macronutrient intake, stool diaries, and fecal short-chain fatty acid concentrations. Result(s): Patients were randomly assigned to low-fiber (n = 55), habitual-fiber (n = 55), or high-fiber (n = 56) dietary advice. Fiber intakes were significantly different between groups (P < 0.001). The difference between groups in the change in IBDQ-B scores between the start and nadir was not significant (P = 0.093). However, the change in score between the start and end of radiotherapy was smaller in the high-fiber group (mean +/- SD: -3.7 +/- 12.8) than in the habitual-fiber group (-10.8 +/- 13.5; P = 0.011). At 1-y postradiotherapy (n = 126) the difference in IBDQ-B scores between the high-fiber (+0.1 +/- 14.5) and the habitualfiber (-8.4 +/- 13.3) groups was significant (P = 0.004). No significant differences were observed in stool frequency or form or in short-chain fatty acid concentrations. Significant reductions in energy, protein, and fat intake occurred in the low- and habitualfiber groups only. Conclusion(s): Dietary advice to follow a high-fiber diet during pelvic radiotherapy resulted in reduced gastrointestinal toxicity both acutely and at 1 y compared with habitual-fiber intake. Restrictive, non-evidence-based advice to reduce fiber intake in this setting should be abandoned.Copyright © 2017 American Society for Nutrition.",Excluded

ULD-CT simulations were generated at dose levels of 100%, 10%, 5%, and 1% using two reconstruction methods: standard filtered back projection (FBP) and iterative reconstruction (ADMIRE). Two readers measured the lower limb torsion in all data sets. The readers also captured image noise in standardized anatomical landmarks. All data sets were evaluated regarding subjective diagnostic confidence (DC; 5-point Likert scale). Effective radiation dose of the original data sets and the simulated ULD-CT was compared. Result(s): There was no significant difference of measured lower limb torsion in any simulated dose level compared to the original data sets in both readers. Dose length product (DLP) of the original examinations was 402.1 +/- 4.3 mGy cm, which resulted in an effective radiation dose of 4.00 +/- 2.12 mSv. Calculated effective radiation dose in ULD-CT at 1% of the original dose was 0.04 mSv. Image noise increased significantly with dose reduction (p < 0.0001) and was dependent on the reconstructional method (p < 0.0001) with less noise using ADMIRE compared to FBP. Both readers rated DC at doses 100%, 10%, and 5% with 5.0/5: there were no ratings worse than 3/5 at 1% dose level. Conclusion(s): The results suggest that radiation dose reduction down to 1% of original CT dose levels may be achieved in CT torsion measurements of the lower limb without compromising diagnostic accuracy. Key Points: * Modern CT delivers exceptional high image quality in musculoskeletal imaging, especially for evaluation of osseous structures. * Usually, this high image quality is accompanied by significant radiation exposure to the patient and may not always be required for the intended purpose, e.g., pure delineation of cortical bone of the lower limb. * This study shows the tremendous prospects of radiation dose reduction without compromising diagnostic confidence in CT torsion measurement of the lower limb.Copyright © 2020, European Society of Radiology.",Excluded
762,"Facilitation of somatic calcium channels can evoke prolonged tail currents in rat hypoglossal motoneurons. Voltage-dependent persistent inward currents (PICs) make an important contribution to the input-output properties of alpha motoneurons. PICs are thought to be mediated by membrane channels located primarily on the dendrites as evidenced by prolonged tail currents following the termination of a voltage step and by a clockwise hysteresis in the whole cell inward currents recorded in response to depolarizing then repolarizing voltage ramp commands. We report here, however, that voltage-clamp currents with these same features can be generated in isolated somatic membrane patches from rat hypoglossal motoneurons. Long-lasting (200-800 ms) tail currents after 1-s voltage-clamp pulses were observed in nucleated patches from 16 of 23 cells. Further, these somatic PICs display ""facilitation"" in response to conditioning depolarization as previously observed in whole cell recordings from intact neurons. Pharmacological tests suggest that the PICs were primarily mediated by Cav1 channels. Our results show that many of the features of persistent calcium currents recorded from intact motoneurons do not necessarily reflect a remote dendritic origin but can also be ascribed to the intrinsic properties of their Cav1 channels.",Excluded
2237,"Evaluation of the effectiveness of arthroscopic rotator cuff repair at the Thong Nhat hospital in Vietnam. We evaluated the results of arthroscopic rotator cuff repair. Thirty cases of rotator cuff tear were treated by arthroscopic rotator cuff repair at the Thong Nhat hospital from 1/3/2012 to 30/6/2016. All patients were over 18 years old, had positive rotator cuff tear tests, and underwent X-ray and magnetic resonance imaging. The arthroscopic images showed rotator cuff tears, with indication for repair. The functional status of each patient was evaluated using the Constant-Murley Scale and the criteria of the University of California at Los Angeles (UCLA). During postoperative rehabilitation, we applied Cohen's protocol. Seventeen patients were female and 13 were male. The median age was 54 years (21-83). Sixteen patients had partial thickness tears and 14 patients had full-thickness tears. Repair technique: Single-row in 13 patients, suture-bridge in 15 patients, transosseous-equivalent in two patients. Four patients with SLAP lesions were treated by debridement labrum for type I, and labral repair for more serious lesions. Five patients with long head biceps tendon rupture were treated with tenodesis. After surgery, 100% of patients were subjected to fluid extravasation through the shoulder joint, but did not have any compartment syndrome; all incisions healed good without infection or neurapraxia. The mean UCLA score was 32.4 (14 patients had excellent results, 14 good, and two fair). The mean Constant score was 38.5; the mean postoperative Constant score was 88.77 (p = 0.001). Among the patients, 90% achieved 80% function compared to a normal shoulder. All patients gave their consent to the study and were prepared for the full course of treatment and arthroscopic surgery. Repair of the rotator cuff was for some participants the only effective treatment and a way to restore the shoulder. Postoperative reconstruction of the rotator cuff of the shoulder resulted in a significant improvement in the indicators of the functional state of the shoulder joint.Copyright © FUNPEC-RP.",Excluded
2597,"Comparing different analysis methods for quantifying the MRI amide proton transfer (APT) effect in hyperacute stroke patients. Amide proton transfer (APT) imaging is a pH mapping method based on the chemical exchange saturation transfer phenomenon that has potential for penumbra identification following stroke. The majority of the literature thus far has focused on generating pH-weighted contrast using magnetization transfer ratio asymmetry analysis instead of quantitative pH mapping. In this study, the widely used asymmetry analysis and a model-based analysis were both assessed on APT data collected from healthy subjects (n = 2) and hyperacute stroke patients (n = 6, median imaging time after onset = 2 hours 59 minutes). It was found that the model-based approach was able to quantify the APT effect with the lowest variation in grey and white matter (<= 13.8 %) and the smallest average contrast between these two tissue types (3.48 %) in the healthy volunteers. The model-based approach also performed quantitatively better than the other measures in the hyperacute stroke patient APT data, where the quantified APT effect in the infarct core was consistently lower than in the contralateral normal appearing tissue for all the patients recruited, with the group average of the quantified APT effect being 1.5 +/- 0.3 % (infarct core) and 1.9 +/- 0.4 % (contralateral). Based on the fitted parameters from the model-based analysis and a previously published pH and amide proton exchange rate relationship, quantitative pH maps for hyperacute stroke patients were generated, for the first time, using APT imaging.

2735,"Evaluating radiation-induced white matter changes in patients treated with stereotactic radiosurgery using diffusion tensor imaging: A pilot study. Stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) has been an effective treatment method for brain tumors; however, few data are available regarding radiation-induced white matter (WM) damage by SRS. In this work, diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) was used to investigate WM changes following SRS. Fifteen patients with gliomas were enrolled, with prescription doses ranging 18-25 Gy. Patients were scanned with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) including DTI before and after SRS. Diffusion tensors were calculated and fiber tracking was performed. Non-irradiated WM volumes and irradiated WM volumes receiving >=12 Gy and >=5 Gy were contoured as volumes of interest (VOI). Apparent diffusion coefficient (), fractional anisotropy (FA) and number of fibers (NF) were calculated and assessed using the Wilcoxon signed-rank test. Compared with those of non-irradiated VOIs, FA and NF decreased considerably after two months of SRS in the irradiated WM VOIs. The variation in was however small and was not statistically significant. The preliminary results suggested that FA and NF might potentially be more sensitive indicators than in measuring radiation-induced WM changes and DTI could be a valuable tool to assess radiation-induced WM changes in SRS. Although it is still preliminary, this pilot study may be useful to provide insights for future studies. © Adenine Press (2014).",Excluded
1771,"Comparison between percutaneous and traditional fixation of lumbar spine fracture: Intraoperative radiation exposure levels and outcomes. Objective: To compare radiation exposure doses and clinical and radiological outcomes between percutaneous pedicular screwing (closed reduction internal fixation [CRIF]) and classical open reduction internal fixation (ORIF) in lumbar spine fracture without neurologic deficit. Material(s) and Method(s): Sixty patients (mean age, 42.5. years) were divided into two treatment groups: (Percutaneous) CRIF versus (traditional) ORIF. Screw position and anatomic vertebral reconstruction were checked on routine control X-ray and postoperative CT scan. Study parameters comprised: surgery time, radiation exposure time, radiation dose level for X-ray (DAP) and for CT (DLP),blood loss, length of hospital stay and postoperative pain (VAS). Result(s): At a mean 25.5. months' follow-up, there were no significant inter-group differences on the epidemiological parameters: age, gender, fracture level, fracture type on the Magerl classification, preoperative local vertebral kyphosis angle, or fracture-to-surgery interval. Effective radiation dose was 3-fold higher in CRIF than in ORIF, but 6-fold lower than for the postoperative CT scan. Postoperative pain on VAS was significantly lower after CRIF, allowing earlier gait resumption and return to work and daily activity. There were no significant differences in length of hospital stay, patient satisfaction, screw malpositioning or postoperative or end-of-follow-up kyphosis angle. Conclusion(s): Percutaneous surgery provided clinical and radiological outcomes strictly comparable to those of open surgery, but with a higher effective radiation exposure dose, including for the medical team and especially for the surgeon. This higher exposure dose, however, is to be relativized by comparison to that of the postoperative CT scan, which involved a much higher exposure dose for the patient. Level of Evidence: Level IV.

1532,"Clinical efficacy of open-irrigated electrode cooled with half-normal saline for initially failed radiofrequency ablation of idiopathic outflow tract ventricular arrhythmias. BACKGROUND: Acute failure of radiofrequency ablation (RFA) of ventricular arrhythmias (VAs) occur in 10%-20% of patients and is partly attributed to inadequate lesion depth acquired with standard ablation protocols. Half-normal saline (HNS)-irrigation is a promising strategy to improve the success rate of VA ablation., OBJECTIVE: This study investigated the efficacy of HNS-irrigated ablation after a failed standard plain normal saline solution (PNSS)-irrigated ablation on idiopathic outflow tract ventricular arrhythmia (OT-VA)., METHOD: This is a prospective observational study of consecutive patients undergoing RFA of idiopathic OT-VA comparing the efficacy of additional HNS-irrigated ablation for failed standard PNSS-irrigated ablation. Acute failure was defined as persistence of spontaneous VA or persistent inducibility of the clinical VA., RESULTS: Out of 160 OT-VA cases (51 +/- 15-year-old, 62 males), 31 underwent HNS irrigation after a failed standard PNSS-irrigated ablation. The HNS group had a significantly longer procedure time (60.06 +/- 43.83 vs 37.51 +/- 33.40 minutes; P = .013) and higher radiation exposure (31.45 +/- 20.24 vs 17.22 +/- 15.25 minutes; P = .001) than the PNSS group but provided an additional acute success in 21 of 31 (67.7%) patients. Over a follow-up duration of 7.8 +/- 4.6 months, 24 recurrences were identified, including 8 (25.8%) in the HNS and 16 (12.4%) in the PNSS group, with lower freedom from recurrence in the HNS group (log rank P = .009). No major complication was observed., CONCLUSION: HNS-irrigated ablation after failed standard PNSS-irrigated ablation is safe and additionally improves acute ablation success by 67.7% for idiopathic OT-VA but with a higher rate of recurrence on follow-up. Whether the application of HNS as initial irrigant could result in better outcome requires further investigation. Copyright © 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",Excluded
252,"Kidney cancer mortality in Spain: geographic patterns and possible hypotheses. BACKGROUND: Since the second half of the 1990s, kidney cancer mortality has tended to stabilize and decline in many European countries, due to the decrease in the prevalence of smokers. Nevertheless, incidence of kidney cancer is rising across the sexes in some of these countries, a trend which may possibly reflect the fact that improvements in diagnostic techniques are being outweighed by the increased prevalence of some of this tumor's risk factors. This study sought to: examine the geographic pattern of kidney cancer mortality in Spain; suggest possible hypotheses that would help explain these patterns; and enhance existing knowledge about the large proportion of kidney tumors whose cause remains unknown., METHODS: Smoothed municipal relative risks (RRs) for kidney cancer mortality were calculated in men and women, using the conditional autoregressive model proposed by Besag, York and Mollie. Maps were plotted depicting smoothed relative risk estimates, and the distribution of the posterior probability of RR>1 by sex., RESULTS: Municipal maps displayed a marked geographic pattern, with excess mortality in both sexes, mainly in towns along the Bay of Biscay, including areas of Asturias, the Basque Country and, to a lesser extent, Cantabria. Among women, the geographic pattern was strikingly singular, not in evidence for any other tumors, and marked by excess risk in towns situated in the Salamanca area and Extremaduran Autonomous Region. This difference would lead one to postulate the existence of different exposures of environmental origin in the various regions., CONCLUSION: The reasons for this pattern of distribution are not clear, and it would thus be of interest if the effect of industrial emissions on this disease could be studied. The excess mortality observed among women in towns situated in areas with a high degree of natural radiation could reflect the influence of exposures which derive from the geologic composition of the terrain and then become manifest through the agency of drinking water.",Excluded
1935,"Estimation of left ventricular ejection fraction with low-dose gated tomographic radionuclide angiography using cadmium-zinc-telluride gamma camera in patients receiving cardio-toxic chemotherapy: A dramatic radiation reduction. Background: Tomographic radionuclide angiography (TRA) is a simple non-invasive procedure which can monitor left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) with automatic processing software, resulting in excellent reproducibility. New gamma cameras using cadmium-zinc-telluride (CZT) detectors enables reduction of the patient radiation dose. We compared LVEF and left ventricular (LV) volumes between low dose and standarddose TRA using a CZT camera. Method(s): Between September and December 2015, patients receiving potentially cardiotoxic chemotherapy and undergoing TRA were consecutively included. CZT acquisition was performed in <> after injection of 550MBq 99mTclabelled human serum albumin and lasted 7 minutes (recommended activity: 550-1110MBq, Society of Nuclear Medicine Guidelines). Each acquisition was analyzed full dose and equivalent half dose by the same physician, using the same software (Quantitative Blood Pool SPECT, Cedars Sinai) to generate LVEF and LV volumes. Result(s): 80 patients were analyzed (40% male, mean age 60 years and BMI 28 kg/m2). There was no significant difference in LVEF and LV systolic and diastolic volumes between full dose and equivalent half dose acquisition (p< 0.005). The contrasttonoise ratio wasn't visually decreased. Effective dose were 3.3 millisieverts (mSv) and 1.65mSv respectively for fulldose and equivalent halfdose acquisitions using our parameters. Conclusion(s): LVEF and LV volumes can accurately be determined using fast low-dose CZT acquisition (7 minutes, < 2mSv, below natural radiation) in patients receiving cardio-toxic chemotherapy. This dose reduction up to 50% from the lowest recommended administered activity allows repeated scans in those patients, with reduced dosimetry. Further dose reductions may be achievable.",Excluded

2335,"A clinical and proteomics approach to predict the presence of obstructive peripheral arterial disease: From the Catheter Sampled Blood Archive in Cardiovascular Diseases (CASABLANCA) Study. BACKGROUND: Peripheral arterial disease (PAD) is a global health problem that is frequently underdiagnosed and undertreated. Noninvasive tools to predict the presence and severity of PAD have limitations including inaccuracy, cost, or need for intravenous contrast and ionizing radiation., HYPOTHESIS: A clinical/biomarker score may offer an attractive alternative diagnostic method for PAD., METHODS: In a prospective cohort of 354 patients referred for diagnostic peripheral and/or coronary angiography, predictors of >=50% stenosis in >=1 peripheral vessel (carotid/subclavian, renal, or lower extremity arteries) were identified from >50 clinical variables and 109 biomarkers. Machine learning identified variables predictive of obstructive PAD; a score derived from the final model was developed., RESULTS: The score consisted of 1 clinical variable (history of hypertension) and 6 biomarkers (midkine, kidney injury molecule-1, interleukin-23, follicle-stimulating hormone, angiopoietin-1, and eotaxin-1). The model had an in-sample area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.85 for obstructive PAD and a cross-validated area under the curve of 0.84; higher scores were associated with greater severity of angiographic stenosis. At optimal cutoff, the score had 65% sensitivity, 88% specificity, 76% positive predictive value (PPV), and 81% negative predictive value (NPV) for obstructive PAD and performed consistently across vascular territories. Partitioning the score into 5 levels resulted in a PPV of 86% and NPV of 98% in the highest and lowest levels, respectively. Elevated score was associated with shorter time to revascularization during 4.3 years of follow-up., CONCLUSIONS: A clinical/biomarker score demonstrates high accuracy for predicting the presence of PAD.

BACKGROUND: The purpose of this study was to determine whether an inverse association exists between latitude, solar ultraviolet B (UVB) irradiance, modeled 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] levels and incidence rates of cancer of the brain., METHODS: Associations of latitude and UVB irradiance with age-standardized incidence rates of cancer of the brain were analyzed for 175 countries while controlling for proportion of population overweight, energy from animal sources, fish consumption, cigarette and alcohol consumption and per capita health expenditures, using multiple regression. Serum 25(OH)D levels were modeled for each country, and their association with brain cancer also was determined., RESULTS: The incidence rates of brain cancer were higher at higher latitudes (R(2) for males = 0.45, p <= 0.0001; R(2) for females = 0.35, p < 0.0001). After adjustment for potential confounders, UVB irradiance (p <= 0.0001) and modeled serum 25(OH)D were inversely associated with incidence rates., CONCLUSIONS: Countries with low solar UVB irradiance and estimated mean serum 25(OH)D levels generally had higher age-standardized incidence rates of brain cancer. Since this was an ecological study, further research would be worthwhile on the association of prediagnostic serum 25(OH)D with incidence rate in studies of cohorts of individuals.

1254,"Long-term results after proton beam therapy for retinal papillary capillary hemangioma. Purpose To evaluate the potential benefit and risk of proton beam therapy in the treatment of symptomatic retinal papillary capillary hemangioma. Design Retrospective interventional case series. Methods This study included patients presenting with symptomatic exudative retinal papillary capillary hemangioma with or without association with von Hippel-Lindau disease. All patients were treated either as a first or a secondary treatment option by proton beam therapy between 2001 and 2009. The minimum follow-up was 30 months. Results Eight eyes of 8 patients (3 male and 5 female, with a mean age of 36 years [range 22-80 years]) were treated for symptomatic papillary retinal hemangioma. The median interval between onset of macular edema and proton beam therapy was 1.7 months (range 0.5-3.3 months). The median follow-up period was 84 months (range 32-106 months) between proton beam treatment and last follow-up. Exudation completely resolved in all but 1 patient after 4.2 months on average (range 2.8-7.2 months). Mean visual acuity prior to proton beam irradiation was 0.7 logMAR (0.2 DIN (DIN 58220 norm)) (range 2-0.3 logMAR) and declined to 0.8 logMAR (0.16 DIN; range 2-0.1 logMAR) at last follow-up examination (no statistical significance, P =.071). Conclusion The anatomic outcome after proton beam therapy for retinal papillary hemangioma is convincing, whereas functional outcome may be compromised because of tumor location, long-persisting macular edema, extensive exudation, and poor initial visual acuity. In patients with extended retinal detachment surgical intervention was still necessary. Although proton beam therapy is proven to be a therapeutic option, treatment will remain challenging. © 2014 by Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.",Excluded
212,"Ocular Radiation Threshold Projection Based off of Fluoroscopy Time During ERCP. Objectives: Current international guidelines for ocular radiation exposure suggest a threshold of 20 millisieverts (mSv)/year. Although endoscopists wear lead aprons, use of protective eye wear is optional. This study was conducted to analyze the lens radiation exposure during endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) for endoscopists to determine the time of fluoroscopy needed to warrant using lens protection during ERCP. Method(s): ERCP patients were prospectively enrolled. Indications, interventions, fluoroscopy time, dose, and attending +/- fellow involvement were recorded. Radiation exposure was collected from body dosimeters and dosimeters placed between the eyes. Cumulative radiation doses were obtained at study completion and averaged over the total fluoroscopy time to determine the mSv/hour exposure. Result(s): A total of 187 cases were included. Attendings and fellows wore lens dosimeters in 178 and 126 cases, respectively, and body dosimeters in 174 and 128 cases, respectively. Attendings and fellows wore lens dosimeters throughout 15.89 and 11.24 h of fluoroscopy, respectively. The cumulative radiation dose absorbed per lens dosimeters was 5.35 mSv for attendings and 2.55 mSv for fellows. The projected lens absorption by the body dosimeters was 19.03 mSv for attendings and 5.21 mSv for fellows. The hourly fluoroscopy lens exposure was 0.34 mSv/hour for attendings and 0.23 mSv/hour for fellows. Conclusion(s): The amount of fluoroscopy hours needed to reach the currently suggested lens threshold limit (20 mSv/year) was 59.41 h for attendings and 88.17 h for fellows. Radioprotective eye wear should be worn by physicians with yearly fluoroscopy times in similarly structured practices that meet or exceed these thresholds.Copyright © 2017 by the American College of Gastroenterology.",Excluded
118,"Anatomic distribution of supraclavicular lymph node in patients with esophageal cancer. Purpose: Definitive chemoradiation therapy remains the standard of care for patients with localized esophageal carcinoma who choose nonsurgical management. However, there is no consensus regarding delineation of the nodal clinical target volume (CTVn), especially for lower cervical lymph nodes. This study aimed to map the location of metastatic supraclavicular lymph nodes in thoracic esophageal carcinoma patients with supraclavicular node involvement and generate an atlas to delineate the CTVn for elective nodal radiation of esophageal squamous cell carcinoma. Patients and Methods: In this study, the supraclavicular regional lymph node was further divided into four subgroups. The locations of the involved supraclavicular nodes for all patients were then transferred onto a template computed tomography (CT) image. A volume probability map was then generated with nodal volumes, and was displayed on the template CT to provide a visual impression of nodal frequencies and anatomic distribution. Result(s): We identified 154 supraclavicular nodal metastases based on CT image in 96 patients. Of these, 29.2% were located in group I region, 59.7% in group II region, 10.4% in group III region, and 0.7% in group IV region. Conclusion(s): On the basis of our study, we suggest that the appropriate radiation field of CTVn should include the group I and II regions and the CTVn exterior margin along the lateral side of the internal jugular vein may be suitable.Copyright © 2016 Xing et al.",Excluded
1930,"Determination of netilmicin in rat serum using high performance liquid chromatography and resonance Rayleigh scattering. A method was developed for the direct determination of netilmicin in rat serum using high performance liquid chromatography and resonance Rayleigh scattering (RRS). The separation was carried out on a Cl8 column with the isocratic elution of the mixture of 20 mmol/L sodium acetate aqueous solution and methanol containing 0.22% trifluoroacetic acid (92: 8, v/ v). With the molecular recognition probe of pontamine sky blue, netilmicin formed an ion-association complex and enhanced the intensity of RRS. The RRS signal was detected by a commercial fluorescence detector at 365 nm of both excitation wavelength (lambdaem) and emission wavelength (lambdaex). Under the optimized conditions, the limit of detection (LOD, S/N = 3) for the netilmicin was 0. 7 mg/L. With the internal standard (IS) of tobramycin, a linear calibration curve ranged from 1. 2 mg/L to 30 mg/L was obtained. The presented method can be used for the pharmacokinetics study of netilmicin in rat serum, and can be a new choice for the determination of aminoglycoside antibiotics in biological samples.",Excluded

The consequences of the treatment of the squamous cell carcinomas of the upper aerodigestive tract (bone removal and external radiation therapy) are constant. Tissue engineering using biphasic calcium phosphate (BCP) and mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) is considered as a promising alternative. We previously demonstrated the efficacy of BCP and total fresh bone marrow (TBM) in regenerating irradiated bone defect. The aim of this study was to know if adding MSC to BCP + TBM mixture could improve the bone formation in irradiated bone defects. Twenty-four Lewis 1A rats received a single dose of 20 Gy to the hind limbs. MSC were sampled from non-irradiated donors and amplified in proliferative, and a part in osteogenic, medium. 3 weeks after, defects were created on femurs and tibias, which were filled with BCP alone, BCP + TBM, BCP + TBM + uncommitted MSC, or BCP + TBM + committed MSC. 3 weeks after, samples were removed and prepared for qualitative and quantitative analysis. The rate of bone ingrowth was significantly higher after implantation of BCP + TBM mixture. The adding of a high concentration of MSC, committed or not, didn't improve the bone regeneration. The association BCP + TBM remains the most efficient material for bone substitution in irradiated areas.Copyright © 2014, Springer Science+Business Media New York.",Excluded

2233,"Stereotactic body radiation therapy for lung metastases from soft tissue sarcoma. Purpose: To appraise the role of stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) in patients with lung metastasis from primary soft tissue sarcoma. Method(s): Twenty-eight patients (51 lesions) were analysed. All patients were in good performance status (1-2 eastern cooperative oncology group (ECOG)), unsuitable for surgical resection, with controlled primary tumour and the number of lung metastases was <=4. In a risk adaptive scheme, the dose prescription was: 30 Gy/1 fr, 60 Gy/3 fr, 60 Gy/8 fr and 48 Gy/4 fr. Treatments were performed with Volumetric Modulated Arc Therapy. Clinical outcome was evaluated by thoracic and abdominal computed tomography (CT) scan before SBRT and than every 3 months. Toxicity was evaluated with Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) scale version 4.0. Result(s): Leiomyosarcoma (36%) and synovial sarcoma (25%) were the most common histologies. Five patients (18%) initially presented with pulmonary metastasis, whereas 23 (82%) developed them at a median time of 51 months (range 11-311 months) from the initial diagnosis. The median follow-up time from initial diagnosis was 65 months (5-139 months) and from SBRT was 21 months (2-80 months). No severe toxicity (grades III-IV) was recorded and no patients required hospitalisation. The actuarial 5-years local control rate (from SBRT treatment) was 96%. Overall survival at 2 and 5 years was 96.2% and 60.5%, respectively. At last follow-up 15 patients (54%) were alive. All other died because of distant progression. Conclusion(s): SBRT provides excellent local control of pulmonary metastasis from soft tissue sarcoma (STS) and may improve survival in selected patients. SBRT should be considered for all patients with pulmonary metastasis (PM) and evaluated in a multidisciplinary team.Copyright © 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",Excluded
879,"[ERCP procedures as a source of radiation risk to a single gastroenterologist]. BACKGROUND: One of the numerous sub-areas of interventional radiology is the use of X-rays in gastroenterology. X-ray fluoroscopy is applied in therapeutic procedures, including endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) that is frequently performed. The ERCP procedure is aimed at imaging the pancreatic duct and biliary tracts., MATERIAL AND METHODS: In this paper radiation risk to the gastrenterologist performing ERCP procedures was investigated. The procedures were performed by a single gastroenterologist in the ERCP Laboratory, University Clinical Hospital Military Memorial Medical Academy - Central Veterans' Hospital in Lodz, Poland. The study comprised 2 series of measurements, one taken during the procedures with continuous fluoroscopy mode, the other during procedures with fluoroscopy in pulsed mode at a frequency of 3 pulses/s. Exposure parameters, anatomical data of patient and dose equivalents for the eyes, skin of the hand and the effective dose for whole body of the gastroenterologist were recorded during each procedure., RESULTS: The collected data cover 70 ERCP procedures - 40 procedures were controlled by continuous fluoroscopy and 30 by pulsed fluoroscopy. The results reveal that pulsed fluoroscopy makes it possible to reduce doses received by the gastroeneterologist from 45% to 60% compared to continuous fluoroscopy., CONCLUSIONS: Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography procedures can cause radiation risk to the gastroenterologist performing them. The use of continuous fluoroscopy can result in achieving an equivalent dose to eye lens nearly 20 mSv per year, i.e., the decreased annual limit recommended by the International Commission on Radiological Protection (ICRP).

2805,"Toward personalized dose-prescription in locally advanced non-small cell lung cancer: Validation of published normal tissue complication probability models. PURPOSE: To identify published normal tissue complication probability (NTCP) models suitable for patient-specific dose-prescription in locally advanced non-small cell lung cancer (LA-NSCLC) through in-house validation., MATERIAL AND METHODS: From eight previously published candidate NTCP models (>=grade 2 acute esophagitis and radiation pneumonitis; AE2, RP2), patient-specific dose-responses were calculated using model variables and fractionation-corrected doses for 241 LA-NSCLC patients treated with chemo-IMRT to 50-80Gy@1.8-2.0Gy between 2004 and 2014 (AE2/RP2 rate: 50%/12%). A model was judged final if it significantly predicted AE2 or RP2 (p<=0.05), was discriminative and well calibrated (AUC>0.60; Hosmer-Lemeshow test pHL>0.05), which were assessed as the median over 1000 bootstrap samples., RESULTS: Models for AE2 had superior discrimination to RP2 models (AUC=0.63-0.65 vs. 0.51-0.65). The final AE2 model included mean esophageal dose and concurrent chemotherapy (AUC=0.65; p<0.0001). The final RP2 model was a slightly adjusted version of the RP2 model with the best discrimination, and included age, mean lung dose, and pulmonary comorbidity (AUC=0.73; p<0.0001)., CONCLUSION: Of the eight investigated and published NTCP models, one model successfully described AE2 and one slightly adjusted model successfully described RP2 in the independent cohort. Estimates from these two NTCP models will, therefore, be considered internally when prescribing patient-specific doses in LA-NSCLC patients. Copyright Published by Elsevier B.V.",Excluded
1248,"Right ventricular pressure-volume loops using simultaneous radionuclide angiography with a multiwire gamma camera and right heart catheterization. BACKGROUND: The purpose of this study was to generate right ventricular (RV) pressure-volume loops (PVLs) from time-activity curves obtained by first-pass radionuclide angiography (RNA) and RV pressures obtained by right heart catheterization., METHODS AND RESULTS: Short-lived tantalum 178 was used to obtain first-pass RNA at baseline (n = 31), after nitroglycerin (n = 5), or after the conclusion of cardiac catheterization (n = 13). From the radionuclide-derived RV ejection fraction and thermodilution stroke volume, the RV end-diastolic volume and end-systolic volume were measured. Special proprietary software was developed and used to integrate the pressure and the RNA data. The mean heart rate was 80 +/- 17 beats/min; RV ejection fraction, 39% +/- 12%; RV end-diastolic volume, 217 +/- 79 mL; RV end-systolic volume, 142 +/- 74 mL; and RV end-diastolic pressure, 10 +/- 7 mm Hg. The RV PVLs were of high quality and reproducible., CONCLUSIONS: This study provides proof of concept of the feasibility of generating RV PVL; the short half-life (10 minutes) and low energy (59 keV) of Ta-178 allow the generation of multiple loops at low radiation exposure. Such studies could be performed at the bedside and provide a wealth of information that may have clinical and research merits.",Excluded
2010,"Does low intensity direct current affect open fracture wound healing?. Aim To explore the effects of a molecular pathway from the application of low-intensity direct current (LIDC) for wound healing through the pathway signalling growth factor and initiation of fi-broblast activation. Methods This randomized clinical trial included 32 patients with open fracture wounds who came to Hasan Sadikin Hospital in Bandung, Indonesia. The patients were divided in the control and the treatment group. Extensive assessment of wound contractions, FGF2 and FGF7 levels, and fibroblast expression were evaluated before and after the treatment. Results This study showed a better wound area repair in the treatment group than the standard group, 3.17+/-0.11 and 0.78+/-0.07, respectively. The increase of FGF-2 level (42.69+/-3.5 and 15.09+/-1.8, respectively), FGF-7 level (42.99+/-3.55 and 14.67+/-1.9, respectively), and fibroblast group expression (7.62+/-0.79 and 3.54+/-0.6, respectively) were found to be higher in the treatment group (p <0.05). Conclusion Low-intensity direct current accelerates wound healing through the increase of growth factor and fibroblast activation.Copyright © 2021, Medical Association of Zenica-Doboj Canton.

47,"Radial versus femoral access for coronary angiography and intervention is associated with lower patient radiation exposure in high-radial-volume centres: Insights from the RAY'ACT-1 study. BACKGROUND: Literature suggests that radial access is associated with higher radiation doses than femoral access., AIMS: To compare patient radiation exposure during coronary angiography (CA) and percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) with radial versus femoral access., METHODS: RAY'ACT is a nationwide, multicentre, French survey evaluating patient radiation in interventional cardiology. Variables of patient exposure from 21,675 CAs and 17,109 PCIs performed at 44 centres during 2010 were analysed retrospectively., RESULTS: Radial access was used in 71% of CAs and 69% of PCIs. Although median fluoroscopy times were longer for radial versus femoral access (CA, 3.8 vs 3.5minutes [P<0.001]; PCI, 10.4 vs 10.1minutes [P=0.001]), the Kerma-area product (KAP) was lower with radial access (CA, 26.8 vs 28.1Gy.cm2; PCI, 55.6 vs 59.4Gy.cm2; both P=0.001). Differences in KAP remained significant in the multivariable analysis (P<0.01), and in a propensity score-matched analysis (P=0.01). A significant interaction was found between KAP and the percentage of procedures with radial access by centre (P<0.001). KAP was higher by radial versus femoral access in low-radial-volume centres, and lower in high-radial-volume centres. Radiation protection techniques, such as the use of low frame rates (7.5 frame/s), were used more frequently in high-radial-volume radial centres., CONCLUSIONS: In this multicentre study, radial access was associated with lower radiation doses to patient than femoral access in high-radial-volume centres. Provided that radioprotection methods are implemented, radial access could be associated with lower patient radiation exposure. Copyright © 2016 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.",Excluded
1516,"[Urethritis syndrome and atypical germ flora of the exterior female genitalia (author's transl)]. A positive microbiological evidence could be obtained 54 times from the smear of the exterior genitals of 80 women suffering from complaints that were caused by urethritis, criteria of the examinations being sterile catheter specimen, negative cystoscopical findings, and missing indications to anatomical changes in the urethral region. Cytological examinations of these cases with regard to the vaginal epithelium had the following results: Group I:6 times; group II: 37 times; group IIW:8 times; group IIId: once; group IVa:twice. The cytological tests were carried out according to the method of papanicolaou as modified by Soost. Furthermore, we could state the following degrees of purity: Degree I: 8 times; degree II:16 times; degree III: 30 times. The cytological examinations of the urethral epithelium demonstrated, in 52 cases, an increased appearance of nude"" completely exposed epithelial cell nuclei--a fact corresponding to a degenerative autolysis (according to Wied). In the 26 women with missing atypical germ flora within the region of the exterior genitals, exclusively groups I (according to Papanicolaou and Soost) and degrees of purity I were stated. These persons also demonstrated remarkably grave psychical disturbances, especially in the intimate regions. In the cases of positive microbiological evidence, the following measures have proved satisfactory: Vaginal hygienization combined with a directly aimed antibacterial therapy, and the prescription of preparations containing lactic acid. A transitory discontinuation of contraceptives is being discussed. Our examination results are emphasizing the necessity of an analysis of the germ flora in cases of complaints arising from urethritis. Also psychical disturbances must be taken into consideration in cases of missing urological and gynaecological criteria of evidence.""",Excluded

701,"Portable Autorefractors for Detecting Axial Length Changes in Space. INTRODUCTION: We evaluated the reproducibility of two portable, self-administered autorefractors (Netra and SVOne Pro) to assess the time course of visual changes on the ISS., METHODS: We measured cycloplegic refractive error at 5 visits at least a week apart in 13 subjects (6 women, 7 men, 30 +/- 9 yr) using both devices seated and also prone with lower body positive pressure (LBPP) applied. Axial length was measured with an optical biometer. Subjects completed a questionnaire on device preferences., RESULTS: The SVOne seated intrasession reproducibility coefficient (RPC) was 0.37 diopters (D), while the Netra's was 0.41 D. Intersession seated results were: RPC = 0.67 D for the SVOne and RPC = 0.54 D for the Netra. The average seated to prone LBPP differences were significantly different from zero for both the SVOne and Netra. The SVOne was preferred in four out of five categories on the questionnaire and took half the time to complete a measurement set compared to the Netra., DISCUSSION: Users preferred the SVOne and it took less time. An SVOne refraction change of 0.67 D from baseline would happen by chance less than 5% of the time. If multiple separate measurements were taken, the detection limit could be reduced (e.g., three repeated measurements could reduce it to 0.38 D). Since astronauts with visual changes show spherical equivalent changes of 0.5 to 1.0 D, in-flight autorefractors could help determine the time course of refractive changes in space from which changes in axial length could be inferred.Masterova KS, Anderson AP, Cowan DR, Fellows AM, Zegans ME, Buckey JC.

Cumulative long-term exposure to solar ultraviolet radiation promotes premature skin aging characterized by wrinkle formation and reduced skin elasticity. In this study, we assessed whether microfat transfer could improve dermal and subcutaneous tissue thickness loss associated with photoaging. Twenty-one patients affected by facial photoaging (photodamage grade II-IV; age range 35-62 years; 19 females, 2 males; all of Caucasian origin) were treated using minimally invasive autologous dermal white fat transfer harvested with a recently designed microcannula. The results were determined by clinical assessment and patient self-evaluation and quantified by the Antera 3D dermal digital device for noninvasive, objective, reliable, and accurate assessment of facial skin texture, color, and wrinkle characteristics. Compared with the pretreatment condition, the increment in soft tissue volume and improvement in skin quality and texture were assessed by a dermatologist after treatment. In addition, instrumental evaluation by digital skin profilometry of the treated areas revealed a 41% reduction in average wrinkle depth (7.29 +/- 1.04 x 10-2 mm pretreatment vs. 4.31 +/- 1.16 x 10-2 mm at 90 days posttreatment; p < 0.001), improved skin texture, more homogeneous and uniform skin color, and declined facial hemoglobin and melanin concentrations. The majority of patients (above 90%) reported improvements in self-perception. No significant complications were reported throughout the study. In conclusion, by using digital profilometry analysis as an objective and innovative tool to determine the outcome of treatment, we demonstrated that autologous microfat transfer is a safe and well-tolerated procedure with measurable beneficial effects on facial skin aging.Copyright © 2017 British Association of Plastic, Reconstructive and Aesthetic Surgeons",Excluded
2410,"Delayed radiation necrosis of brain evaluated positron emission tomography. In four patients highly suspected of having delayed radiation necrosis of the brain, regional cerebral blood flow and metabolism were studied by using positron emission tomography (PET) with the 15O-labelled gases, 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (18FDG). All four patients showed marked decreases in glucose and oxygen consumption in the lesion with that suspected pathology in comparison with those in normal brain parenchyma. Two of them were histologically proved to have radiation injuries (one was radiation necrosis and another was early delayed reactions). But one patient was histologically proved to have a recurrent tumor. Although metabolic study with PET using 18FDG is generally an excellent procedure for differentiation between radiation injuries and recurrent brain tumor, these results imply that in some cases the differential diagnosis is difficult even with 18FDG. The present study demonstrated considerably more pronounced reduction in the metabolism than the decrease of the blood flow in the lesion with radiation necrosis. This result would indicate that the primary effect causing the radiation necrosis is a direct effect of irradiation on neural tissue rather than the capillary damage.",Excluded

OBJECTIVES: To prospectively compare the diagnostic performance of reduced-dose (RD) contrast-enhanced CT (CECT) with standard-dose (SD) CECT for detection of low-contrast liver lesions., METHODS: Seventy adults with non-liver primary malignancies underwent abdominal SD-CECT immediately followed by RD-CECT, aggressively targeted at 60-70 % dose reduction. SD series were reconstructed using FBP. RD series were reconstructed with FBP, ASIR, and MBIR (Veo). Three readers-blinded to clinical history and comparison studies-reviewed all series, identifying liver lesions >=4 mm. Non-blinded review by two experienced abdominal radiologists-assessing SD against available clinical and radiologic information-established the reference standard., RESULTS: RD-CECT mean effective dose was 2.01 +/- 1.36 mSv (median, 1.71), a 64.1 +/- 8.8 % reduction. Pooled per-patient performance data were (sensitivity/specificity/PPV/NPV/accuracy) 0.91/0.78/0.60/0.96/0.81 for SD-FBP compared with RD-FBP 0.79/0.75/0.54/0.91/0.76; RD-ASIR 0.84/0.75/0.56/0.93/0.78; and RD-MBIR 0.84/0.68/0.49/0.92/0.72. ROC AUC values were 0.896/0.834/0.858/0.854 for SD-FBP/RD-FBP/RD-ASIR/RD-MBIR, respectively. RD-FBP (P = 0.002) and RD-MBIR (P = 0.032) AUCs were significantly lower than those of SD-FBP; RD-ASIR was not (P = 0.052). Reader confidence was lower for all RD series (P < 0.001) compared with SD-FBP, especially when calling patients entirely negative., CONCLUSIONS: Aggressive CT dose reduction resulted in inferior diagnostic performance and reader confidence for detection of low-contrast liver lesions compared to SD. Relative to RD-ASIR, RD-FBP showed decreased sensitivity and RD-MBIR showed decreased specificity., KEY POINTS: * Reduced-dose CECT demonstrates inferior diagnostic performance for detecting low-contrast liver lesions. * Reader confidence is lower with reduced-dose CECT compared to standard-dose CECT. * Overly aggressive dose reduction may result in misdiagnosis, regardless of reconstruction algorithm. * Careful consideration of perceived risks versus benefits of dose reduction is crucial.",Excluded
3537,"Use of Artificial Intelligence to Reduce Radiation Exposure at Fluoroscopy-Guided Endoscopic Procedures. OBJECTIVES:Exposure to ionizing radiation remains a hazard for patients and healthcare providers. We evaluated the utility of an artificial intelligence (AI)-enabled fluoroscopy system to minimize radiation exposure during image-guided endoscopic procedures. METHOD(S):We conducted a prospective study of 100 consecutive patients who underwent fluoroscopy-guided endoscopic procedures. Patients underwent interventions using either conventional or AI-equipped fluoroscopy system that uses ultrafast collimation to limit radiation exposure to the region of interest. The main outcome measure was to compare radiation exposure with patients, which was measured by dose area product. Secondary outcome was radiation scatter to endoscopy personnel measured using dosimeter. RESULT(S):Of 100 patients who underwent procedures using traditional (n = 50) or AI-enabled (n = 50) fluoroscopy systems, there was no significant difference in demographics, body mass index, procedural type, and procedural or fluoroscopy time between the conventional and the AI-enabled fluoroscopy systems. Radiation exposure to patients was lower (median dose area product 2,178 vs 5,708 mGym2, P = 0.001) and scatter effect to endoscopy personnel was less (total deep dose equivalent 0.28 vs 0.69 mSv; difference of 59.4%) for AI-enabled fluoroscopy as compared to conventional system. On multivariate linear regression analysis, after adjusting for patient characteristics, procedural/fluoroscopy duration, and type of fluoroscopy system, only AI-equipped fluoroscopy system (coefficient 3,331.9 [95% confidence interval: 1,926.8-4,737.1, P < 0.001) and fluoroscopy duration (coefficient 813.2 [95% confidence interval: 640.5-985.9], P < 0.001) were associated with radiation exposure.DISCUSSION:The AI-enabled fluoroscopy system significantly reduces radiation exposure to patients and scatter effect to endoscopy personnel (see Graphical abstract, Supplementary Digital Content, http://links.lww.com/AJG/B461).Copyright © 2020 by The American College of Gastroenterology.",Excluded
2131,"Characteristics of photopheresis treatments for the management of rejection in heart and lung transplant recipients. Photopheresis has been used in the management of rejection of heart and/or lung transplants. Although its mechanism of action remains unknown, irradiated T-helper cell-induced immunosuppression is the main theory. Since transplant recipients are often lymphopenic and lymphocytes are the target cells in photo-therapy, we performed this study to determine which factors affect the cellular yield to undergo irradiation. We reviewed the records of all photophereses performed in our institution between July 1998 and April 2000 using the UVAR (first generation) or XTS (second generation) instruments (Therakos, Exton, PA). Our data included patient's blood volume, absolute lymphocyte count and hematocrit, catheter type, flow rate of collection cycles and centrifuge bowl size, as well as volume, hematocrit, and lymphocyte count of the cell suspension. With a mixed model multivariate analysis we sought to determine which variables predicted the lymphocyte yield. A total of 406 procedures in 25 adult patients was analyzed. There was no significant difference between the lymphocyte yield among the procedures performed with the first- and the second-generation instruments. The patient's absolute lymphocyte count was the only parameter, which positively correlated with the total number of lymphocytes collected for irradiation (P < 0.0001). Indeed, based on the mixed model, the total number of lymphocytes for irradiation can be predicted from the pre-procedure lymphocyte count. Additional studies are necessary to correlate the number of treated cells with patient outcome. © 2002 Wiley-Liss, Inc.",Excluded
2578,"Role of Angiogenesis in Chronic Radiation Proctitis: New Evidence Favoring Inhibition of Angiogenesis Ex Vivo. Background: Chronic radiation proctitis (CRP), a common complication after radiotherapy for pelvic malignancies, compromises patient quality of life. Vascular damage and aberrant angiogenesis in the mucosal layer are essential histological features, but changes to the submucosal layer are unclear. Thus, we evaluated the histological characteristics and distribution changes of key angiogenic factors in full-layered human CRP samples. Method(s): Thirty paraffin-embedded CRP and twenty-nine non-CRP tissues were used to evaluate histopathological changes. Immunohistochemistry with anti-CD34 antibody was performed to calculate microvascular density (MVD). Frozen tissues from eight CRP patients and five non-CRP controls were collected and analyzed by antibody array, which contained sixty human angiogenesis-related factors. Quality controls with positive and negative controls were performed during antibody array analysis. Two differentially expressed factors were confirmed by ELISA. Result(s): CRP lesions showed vasculopathy, fibrosis, mucosal ulceration, edema, and inflammatory cell infiltration. Human angiogenesis antibody array and ELISA confirmed the increased angiostatin in CRP lesions. Immunohistochemical staining showed dispersed distribution of angiostatin throughout the mucosal and submucosal layers in CRP lesions, while angiostatin accumulated within the vessel lumens in non-CRP tissues. MVD significantly decreased in the submucosal layer of CRP, suggesting a potential association with increased angiostatin. Conclusion(s): Angiostatin increased and had a distinct distribution in CRP lesions. Compensatory telangiectasia in the mucosa, vessel stenosis, and reduced MVD might attenuate blood flow in the submucosa and contribute to CRP progression. Restoration of vascular functionality by promoting angiogenesis in the submucosal layer may help alleviate CRP in clinical practice.Copyright © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.",Excluded
3545,"Biodistribution and radiation dosimetry of the serotonin 5-HT₆ ligand [¹¹C]GSK215083 determined from human whole-body PET. PURPOSE: We measured the whole-body distribution of IV-injected [¹¹C]GSK215083, a new 5-HT₆ antagonist PET tracer, as a function of time in adult subjects, in order to determine the radiation exposure.
PROCEDURES: After injection with a single bolus of [¹¹C]GSK215083 (range 330-367 MBq; mean 346 MBq), PET emission data were acquired for approximately 120 min in six subjects (three males and three females). Five organs were identified as exhibiting uptake above background. For these, regions of interest were delineated on emission images, and time-activity curves (TAC) generated. Residence times were calculated as the area under the curve of the TAC, normalized to injected activities and standard values of organ volumes. Dosimetry calculations were then performed using the computer program OLINDA/EXM 1.0.
RESULTS: The mean effective dose averaged over both males and females (deviation) was estimated to be 7.7 ± 1.0 μSv/MBq (male 7.0 ± 0.4; female 8.5 ± 0.6). For the effective dose equivalent, the corresponding values are 7.8 ± 1.2 μSv/MBq (male 6.8 ± 0.5; female 8.9 ± 0.1). The organ receiving the highest dose was the lung, with an average equivalent dose of 25.6 ± 6.9 μSv/MBq (male 20.8 ± 5.6; female 30.4 ± 4.4).
CONCLUSION: The estimated radiation dose for [¹¹C]GSK215083 is consistent with those for other neuroreceptor ligands labeled with carbon-11. The somewhat higher dose estimate for females compared to males may reflect the difference in observed residence times and representative differences in the male and female phantoms used for dosimetry calculations. Based on conventionally accepted dose limits, [¹¹C]GSK215083 may be used for multiple PET scans in the same subject.",Excluded

INTRODUCTION: A high prevalence of vitamin D deficiency has been reported in Parkinson's disease (PD). Epidemiologic studies examining variability in genes involved in vitamin D metabolism have not taken into account level of exposure to ultraviolet radiation (UVR). We examined whether exposure to UVR (as a surrogate for vitamin D levels) and variations in the vitamin D receptor gene (VDR) are associated with PD., METHODS: Within a geographical information system (GIS) we linked participants' geocoded residential address data to ground level UV data to estimate historical exposure to UVR. Six SNPs in VDR were genotyped in non-Hispanic Caucasian subjects., RESULTS: Average lifetime UVR exposure levels were >5000 Wh/m(2), which was higher than levels for populations in previous studies, and UVR exposure did not differ between cases and controls. Homozygotes for the rs731236 TT (major allele) genotype had a 31% lower risk of PD risk (OR=0.69; 95% CI=0.49, 0.98; p=0.04 for TT vs. TC+CC). The rs7975232 GG (minor allele) genotype was also associated with decreased risk of PD (OR=0.63; 95% CI=0.42, 0.93; p=0.02 for GG vs. TG+TT). The association between PD risk and a third locus, rs1544410 (BsmI), was not statistically significant after adjustment for covariates, although there was a trend for lower risk with the GG genotype., CONCLUSIONS: This study provides initial evidence that VDR polymorphisms may modulate risk of PD in a population highly exposed to UVR throughout lifetime.

Chronic skin ulcers still represent a therapeutic challenge in dermatology. Among the various non-invasive treatment modalities used for the improvement of impaired wound healing, low-intensity laser irradiations are gaining an increasing body of interest. We used low-intensity laser irradiations delivered by a 30 mW helium-neon laser at an energy density of 30 J/cm2 three times weekly for the induction of wound healing in ulcers of diverse causes. Twenty patients with the same number of ulcers, which had previously been treated by conventional wound care for a median period of 34 weeks (range: 3-120 weeks) without any significant evidence of healing, were included in the study. Concerning the underlying disorders, patients were divided into four groups: diabetes, arterial insufficiency, radio damage and autoimmune vasculitis. In all ulcers, complete epithelization could be induced by laser therapy. No amputation or any other surgical intervention was necessary and no adverse effects of any kind were noted during low-intensity laser treatment. Regarding the different diagnoses, a statistically significant difference was noted (P = 0.008): ulcers due to radio damage healed significantly faster than those caused by diabetes (6 weeks [range: 3-10 weeks] vs. 16 weeks [range: 9-45 weeks], P = 0.005). Wound healing in autoimmune vasculitis (24 weeks [range: 20-35 weeks]) required longer than in radiodermitis, although the difference was not significant. In addition to the diagnosis, wound size was found to be an important factor influencing the duration of wound closure (P = 0.028), whereas duration of previous conventional treatment (P = 0.24) and depth (P = 0.14) showed no effect. Our results indicate that low-intensity laser irradiation could be a valuable non-invasive tool for the induction of wound healing in recalcitrant ulcers, and that healing time is correlated with the ulcer cause and size.",Excluded

Conclusion: The tumor's grade, rather than the tumor's location, was related to the opportunity of preserving laryngeal functions in patients with pyriform sinus cancer. The survival rate decreased significantly with the increase of tumor grade or node grade. Preservation of laryngeal functions is a safe and promising method without compromising the survival rate of patients with pyriform sinus cancer. Objective(s): Surgical resection of pyriform sinus carcinoma has a profound influence on the preservation of laryngeal functions. The purpose of this study was to assess the safety and efficacy of the surgical treatment of pyriform sinus carcinoma in the preservation of laryngeal functions without compromising the survival rate. Method(s): Two hundred and thirty patients with pyriform sinus cancer had been operated from March 1978 to December 2002. Of them, 158 cases had been operated with the preservation of laryngeal functions and 72 cases had been undergone total laryngectomy. In addition, 216 cases had received adjuvant postoperative radiotherapy. All cases were followed up for 6-12 months (mean 51 +/- 26) after surgery. The survival rate was calculated on the basis of Kaplan-Meier analysis, and the factors that influenced the survival rate of patients with and without preservation of laryngeal functions were analyzed with the log-rank test. Result(s): Laryngeal functions were preserved completely (speech, respiration, and deglutition) in 70.9% (112/158) cases, and partially (speech and deglutition) in 29.1% (46/158) cases. The 3- and 5-year survival rates were 75.4% and 59.0%, respectively, for the group with laryngeal function preservation, and 58.6% and 41.5%, respectively, for the group without preservation. There was no statistically significant difference in the survival rate between the two groups within the follow-up period (p > 0.05). Increase in the tumor grade resulted in a proportional decrease of patients with preservation of laryngeal function (p < 0.05). Increase in the tumor grade (p < 0.05) or node grade (p < 0.05) also led to significant decrease in the survival rate. The location of the primary lesions (the lateral wall or medial wall of the pyriform sinus) showed no significant influence on either the opportunity for preserving laryngeal functions (p > 0.05) or survival rate of patients (p > 0.05). © 2011 Informa Healthcare.",Excluded

572,"A multicenter study comparing the outcome of catheter ablation of atrial fibrillation between cryoballoon and radiofrequency ablation in patients with heart failure (CRABL-HF): Study design. Background: Catheter ablation of atrial fibrillation (AF) is increasingly performed worldwide in patients with heart failure (HF). However, it has been recently emphasized that AF ablation in patients with HF is associated with increased risks of procedure-related complications and mortality. There are little data about the differences in the efficacy and safety between cryoballoon (CB) and radiofrequency (RF) ablation of AF in patients with HF. Method(s): The CRABL-HF study is designed as a prospective, multicenter, open-label, controlled, and randomized clinical trial comparing the efficacy and safety of AF ablation between CB and RF ablation in patients with HF (LVEF <=40%) (UMIN Clinical Trials Registry UMIN000032433). The CRABL-HF study will consist of 110 patients at multicenter in Japan. The patients will be registered and randomly assigned to either the CB ablation or RF ablation group with a 1:1 allocation. The primary endpoint of this study is the occurrence of atrial tachyarrhythmias (ATs) at 1 year with a blanking period of 90 days after ablation. Key secondary endpoints are the success rate of the pulmonary vein isolation, total procedural time, left atrial dwelling time, total fluoroscopy time, radiation exposure, complication rate, composite of all-cause mortality or HF hospitalizations, cardiovascular events, change in left ventricular ejection fraction, and change in quality of life. Result(s): The results of this study are currently under investigation. Conclusion(s): The CRABL-HF study is being conducted to compare the efficacy and safety of catheter ablation of AF between CB and RF ablation in patients with HF.Copyright © 2020 The Authors.

2582,"Schwann cell engraftment into injured peripheral nerve prevents changes in action potential properties. Peripheral nerve injury results in changes in action potential waveform, ion channel organization, and firing properties of primary afferent neurons. It has been suggested that these changes are the result of reduction in basal trophic support from skin targets. Subcutaneous injections of Fluro-Gold (FG) in the hind limb of the rat were used to identify cutaneous primary afferent neurons. Five days after FG injection, sciatic nerves were ligated and encapsulated in a silicon tube allowing neuroma formation. Green fluorescent protein (GFP)-expressing Schwann cells (SCs) were injected proximal to the cut end of the nerve. Thirteen to 22 days after injury and SC injection, the L4 and L5 dorsal root ganglia (DRG) were prepared for acute culture. Whole cell patch-clamp recordings in current clamp mode were obtained and action potential properties of medium-sized (34-45 microm) FG+ DRG neurons were characterized. In the neuroma group without cell transplantation, action potential duration and spike inflections were reduced as were the amplitude and duration of spike afterhyperpolarizations. These changes were not observed after transection by nerve crush where axons were allowed to regenerate to distal peripheral targets. In the transplantation group, GFP(+)-SCs were extensively distributed throughout the neuroma, and oriented longitudinally along axons proximal to the neuroma. Changes in action potential properties were attenuated in the GFP(+)-SC group. Thus the engrafted SC procedure ameliorated the changes in action potential waveform of cutaneous primary afferents associated with target disconnection and neuroma formation.",Excluded
3119,"Effects of Far-Infrared Therapy on Foot Circulation Among Hemodialysis Patients With Diabetes Mellitus. BACKGROUND: Far-infrared radiation (FIR) therapy improves vessel dilation, circulation, vessel endothelial function, and angiogenesis and reduces atherosclerosis. However, evidence of FIR therapy's effects on foot circulation among diabetic patients undergoing hemodialysis is scarce., AIM: To determine whether FIR therapy improves foot circulation in diabetic patients undergoing hemodialysis., DESIGN: Quasi-experimental., METHODS: In June to November 2017, diabetic patients undergoing hemodialysis (N = 58) at a hemodialysis center in northern Taiwan were divided into two groups: the experimental group (n = 31) received FIR therapy to the bilateral dorsalis pedis artery (40 min/session, 3 times/week for 6 months) and the control group (n = 27) received conventional dialysis care. Paired t test, independent samples t test, two-proportion Z test, and repeated-measures analysis of covariance were performed to compare changes from baseline to the end of the 6-month intervention between the groups., RESULTS: Significant positive effects of FIR therapy on temperature, pulse, and blood flow of the dorsalis pedis artery were observed. Sensitivity to pain, tactility, and pressure also improved significantly in the experimental group. The Edinburgh Claudication Questionnaire revealed that the experimental group had reductions in subjective experiences of soreness, tingling, and coldness in the feet., CONCLUSION: The findings of significant improvements to objective and subjective measures of blood flow and neural function in the experimental group indicate that FIR therapy improves blood circulation to the feet. This therapy thus has great potential to be an effective adjuvant treatment for patients with diabetes mellitus undergoing hemodialysis.",Excluded
2821,"A hypothetical protocol for the provisional use of perfusion imaging with exercise stress testing. Background: Previous literature suggests that the results of myocardial perfusion imaging (MPI) add little to the prognosis of patients who exercise >10 metabolic equivalents (METS) during stress testing. With this in mind, we attempted to determine if a provisional injection protocol could be developed in which a patient would not receive an injection of radioisotope if adequate exercise was achieved without symptoms and a negative ECG response. This protocol would save a substantial amount of time, radiation exposure, and cost. Method(s): All patients who underwent a stress SPECT MPI over a 6.5-year period from 2004 to 2010 were included. Patients who would have been considered for a standby injection protocol were: exercise stress, age < 65, no known coronary artery disease (CAD), and an interpretable ECG. Patients were retrospectively divided into two groups based on whether they would have received radioisotope or not. Criteria for not injecting included a maximal predicted heart rate >= 85%, >=10 METS of exercise, no symptoms of chest pain or shortness of breath, and no ECG changes (ST depression or arrhythmia). The two groups were then compared based on MPI results and all-cause mortality derived from the Social Security Death Index. Result(s): A total of 24,689 patients underwent SPECT MPI during this period, and 5,352 would have been eligible for a provisional injection protocol. There were 3,791 (70.8%), who would have been injected and 1,561 (29.2%), who would not have been. Perfusion results were abnormal in 5.9% of non-injected group compared to 14.4% in those who would have been injected. After a mean follow-up of 60.6 +/- 21.4 months, 1.1% had died in the non-injected cohort compared to 2.2% in the injected group. Conclusion(s): A provisional injection protocol defined as age < 65, normal rest ECG, no history of CAD, and high level exercise with a negative ECG response and no symptoms has a very low 5-year all-cause mortality and low yield of MPI. If adopted it would decrease radiation exposure and save time and health care costs without jeopardizing prognosis. © 2013 American Society of Nuclear Cardiology.",Excluded
975,"A cross-sectional case control study on genetic damage in individuals residing in the vicinity of a mobile phone base station. Mobile phone base stations facilitate good communication, but the continuously emitting radiations from these stations have raised health concerns. Hence in this study, genetic damage using the single cell gel electrophoresis (comet) assay was assessed in peripheral blood leukocytes of individuals residing in the vicinity of a mobile phone base station and comparing it to that in healthy controls. The power density in the area within 300 m from the base station exceeded the permissive limits and was significantly (p = 0.000) higher compared to the area from where control samples were collected. The study participants comprised 63 persons with residences near a mobile phone tower, and 28 healthy controls matched for gender, age, alcohol drinking and occupational sub-groups. Genetic damage parameters of DNA migration length, damage frequency (DF) and damage index were significantly (p = 0.000) elevated in the sample group compared to respective values in healthy controls. The female residents (n = 25) of the sample group had significantly (p = 0.004) elevated DF than the male residents (n = 38). The linear regression analysis further revealed daily mobile phone usage, location of residence and power density as significant predictors of genetic damage. The genetic damage evident in the participants of this study needs to be addressed against future disease-risk, which in addition to neurodegenerative disorders, may lead to cancer.",Excluded

3406,"The genome-wide effects of ionizing radiation on mutation induction in the mammalian germline. The ability to predict the genetic consequences of human exposure to ionizing radiation has been a long-standing goal of human genetics in the past 50 years. Here we present the results of an unbiased, comprehensive genome-wide survey of the range of germline mutations induced in laboratory mice after parental exposure to ionizing radiation and show irradiation markedly alters the frequency and spectrum of de novo mutations. Here we show that the frequency of de novo copy number variants (CNVs) and insertion/deletion events (indels) is significantly elevated in offspring of exposed fathers. We also show that the spectrum of induced de novo single-nucleotide variants (SNVs) is strikingly different; with clustered mutations being significantly over-represented in the offspring of irradiated males. Our study highlights the specific classes of radiation-induced DNA lesions that evade repair and result in germline mutation and paves the way for similarly comprehensive characterizations of other germline mutagens.Copyright © 2015 Macmillan Publishers Limited.",Excluded
2080,"CT findings of KUB injury in Hemodynamically stable blunt abdominal injury patients with microscopic hematuria. Background: According to controversial guideline for management in case of hemodynamically stable blunt abdominal injury with microscopic hematuria. Most of the patients could be omitted for abdominal computed tomography (CT). Despite high sensitivity and specificity of abdominal CT, in addition to high medical cost, there are risks from radiation exposure and adverse reaction from use of contrast media. Objective(s): To evaluate the prevalence of KUB injury on abdominal CT in case of hemodynamically stable blunt abdominal injury with microscopic hematuria. Material(s) and Method(s): Forty-one studies of abdominal CT performed during 1 January 2010 and 30 June 2012 were retrospectively reviewed for KUB injury (categorized by AAST organ injury scale) by consensus of two experienced radiologists. Result(s): KUB injury was found in 36.6% from all selected CT studies. Almost all cases could be managed conservatively. The cutoff point of microscopic hematuria at 20 cells/hpf has sensitivity 80% and specificity 46.15%. Conclusion(s): One-third of the patients have KUB injury but almost all of them could be conservatively managed. We proposed that the cutoff point of hematuria be equivalent to or greater than 20 cells/hpf to be one of the indicators for predicting KUB injury that needs radiological evaluation; but it should be carefully considered along with clinical information.Copyright © 2015 Medical Association of Thailand.

3061,"EUS-guided portal pressure gradient measurement with a simple novel device: a human pilot study. Background and Aims Portal hypertension (PH) is a serious adverse event of liver cirrhosis. The hepatic venous pressure gradient or portal pressure gradient (PPG) accurately reflects the degree of PH and is the single best prognostic indicator in liver disease. This is usually obtained by interventional radiology (IR), although it is not routinely performed. Recently, we developed a simple novel technique for EUS-guided PPG measurement (PPGM). Our animal studies showed excellent correlation between EUS-PPGM and IR-PPGM. We present the first human pilot study of EUS-PPGM in patients with liver disease. Methods EUS-PPGM was performed by experienced endosonographers using a linear echoendoscope, a 25-gauge fine-needle aspiration needle, and a novel compact manometer. The portal vein and hepatic vein (or inferior vena cava) were targeted using a transgastric-transduodenal approach. Clinical parameters of PH were evaluated in each patient. Feasibility was defined as successful PPGM in each patient. Safety was based on adverse events captured in a postprocedural interview. Results Twenty-eight patients underwent EUS-PPGM with 100% technical success and no adverse events. PPG ranged from 1.5 to 19 mm Hg and had excellent correlation with clinical parameters of portal hypertension including the presence of varices (P = .0002), PH gastropathy (P = .007), and thrombocytopenia (P = .036). PPG was increased in patients with high clinical evidence of cirrhosis (P = .005). Conclusion This novel technique of EUS-PPGM using a 25-gauge needle and compact manometer is feasible and appears safe. Given the availability of EUS and the simplicity of the manometry setup, EUS-guided PPG may represent a promising breakthrough for procuring indispensable information in the management of patients with liver disease.Copyright © 2017",Excluded

Background: Percutaneous vertebroplasty (PVP) typically involves conventional lower-viscosity cement injection via bipedicular approach. Limited evidence is available comparing the clinical outcomes and complications in treating osteoporotic vertebral compression fractures (OVCFs) with PVP using high-viscosity cement through unipedicular or bipedicular approach. Methods and design: Fifty patients with OVCFs were randomly allocated into two groups adopting unipedicular or bipedicular PVP. The efficacy of unipedicular and bipedicular PVP was assessed by comparing operation time, X-ray exposure time, incidence of complications, vertebral height restoration, and improvement of the visual analogue scale (VAS), Oswestry disability index (ODI) and Short Form-36 (SF-36) General Health Survey scores. Result(s): The mean operative and exposure time to X-rays in the unipedicular PVP group was less than that of the bipedicular group (p < 0.05). No statistically significant differences were observed in the VAS score, ODI score, SF-36 score, cement leakage rate or vertebral height restoration between the two groups (p > 0.05). Conclusion(s): Unipedicular and bipedicular PVP are safe and effective treatments for OVCF.

OBJECTIVE: The aim of the study was to validate a body mass index (BMI)-adapted contrast material protocol to compensate for the effect of BMI on coronary attenuation during low-dose coronary CT angiography with prospective ECG triggering., MATERIALS AND METHODS: One hundred forty patients underwent prospectively ECG-triggered coronary CT angiography for clinical indications. The following BMI-adapted contrast material protocol was used for imaging of 70 consecutively registered patients: BMI < 17.5, 50 mL contrast material at 4.0 mL/s; 17.5-22.4, 55 mL at 4.0 mL/s; 22.5-24.9, 65 mL at 4.0 mL/s; 25.0-27.4, 80 mL at 4.5 mL/s; 27.5-29.9, 80 mL at 5.0 mL/s; 30.0-34.9, 85 mL at 5.0 mL/s; 35.0-40.0, 95 mL at 5.0 mL/s; > 40, 105 mL at 5.0 mL/s. Seventy patients matched for BMI who had previously undergone routine coronary CT angiography with a fixed contrast material dosage of 80 mL at 5 mL/s served as the reference group. Vessel attenuation in the left main and proximal right coronary arteries was measured and correlated with BMI, and the results in the two protocol groups were compared., RESULTS: The groups were well matched for BMI. The mean BMI in the nonadapted protocol group was 26.5 +/- 4.0 (standard deviation) (range, 18.9-36.5), and that in the BMI-adapted protocol group was 26.7 +/- 4.2 (range, 18.2-37.2) (p not significant). The mean amount of contrast material used was smaller in the BMI-adapted group (73.9 +/- 11.2 vs 80.0 +/- 0 mL; p < 0.01). Mean coronary artery attenuation did not differ significantly between the two groups (386 +/- 102 HU vs 385 +/- 64 HU; p not significant). Without BMI adaptation, coronary attenuation correlated strongly with BMI (r = -0.63; p < 0.001). With the BMI-adapted protocol, however, there was no correlation between BMI and coronary attenuation (r = -0.24; p not significant)., CONCLUSION: We validated a BMI-adapted contrast material protocol that results in adequate coronary vessel attenuation independent of individual BMI despite a significant reduction in overall amount of contrast material used.",Excluded

1478,"The impact of margin reduction on outcome and toxicity in head and neck cancer patients treated with image-guided volumetric modulated arc therapy (VMAT). Background and purpose: In recent decades, outcomes of patients with head and neck cancer (HNC) have improved as a result of implementing several strategies, such as chemoradiation. However, these improvements were achieved at the cost of increased toxicity. One way to reduce radiation-related toxicity is by reducing the margins. Material(s) and Method(s): Between 2013 and 2016, 206 consecutive patients were treated with CTV-PTV margin of 5 mm and subsequently 208 patients with 3 mm margin. This study evaluates the impact of reducing clinical target volume (CTV) to planning target volume (PTV) margin on outcome and toxicity. Result(s): All patients were treated with volumetric modulated arc therapy (VMAT) with daily-image guidance using cone-beam CT (CBCT). Overall acute grade 3 toxicity was significantly lower in 3 mm-group, compared to 5 mm-group (53.8% vs. 65%, respectively, p = 0.032). The same was true for acute grade 3 mucositis (30.8% vs. 42.2%, p = 0.008) and for acute grade 3 dysphagia (feeding tube-dependence) (22.1% vs. 33.5%, p = 0.026). The incidence of ongoing feeding tube-dependence after 3 months of radiotherapy was 11.1% and 20.4%, respectively (p = 0.012). The 2-year incidence of late grade >=2 xerostomia was 15.8% and 19.4% (p = 0.8). The 2-year loco-regional control rates of patients treated in 3 mm and 5 mm-groups were 79.9% and 79.2% (p = 1.0). The figures for disease-free survival were 71.5% and 72.7 (p = 0.6) and for overall survival were 75.2% and 75.1% (p = 0.9).

The widely held view that transfused bone marrow cells will not proliferate in normal mice, not exposed to irradiation or other forms of bone marrow ablation, was reinvestigated. Forty million bone marrow cells from male donors were given to female recipients on each of 5 consecutive days, 5 to 10 times the number customarily used in the past. When the recipients were examined 2-13 weeks after the last transfusion, donor cells were found to average 16-25% of total marrow cells. Similar percentages of donor cells were found when variants of the enzyme phosphoglycerate kinase determined electrophoretically were used for identification of donor and recipient cells. Evidence is presented that the proportion of donor cells is compatible with a linear dependence on the number of cells transfused over the range tested--i.e., 20-200 million bone marrow cells injected intravenously.

378,[Stimulation of the suppressor activity in relation to hematopoietic cells in the mouse thymus as affected by pertussis vaccine]. After a single intraperitoneal injection of formalinized whole-cell pertussis vaccine 5374 into CBA mice a drastic depletion of cells in the thymus accompanied by the enhancement of suppressor T-cells production is observed. T-cells inhibit the endogenous and exogenous colony-formation in the spleen by hematopoietic stem cells (CFUs). Treatment of thymus cells with the anti-I-Jk alloantiserum against a specific marker of suppressor T-cells in the presence of complement removes the inhibitory effect on CFUs proliferation and has a stimulatory action on the capacity of the marrow CFUs to form macroscopic hematopoietic colonies in the spleen compared with control ones. These results suggest probable involvement of I-J-bearing suppressor T-cells in the hematopoietic disorders induced by pertussis vaccine.,Excluded

In multilevel analysis with potential confounding factors, solar radiation was significantly negatively associated with most site-specific cancers, but not with gallbladder and liver cancer in men and stomach and breast cancer in women. Our findings support the preventive effective of solar radiation on several types of cancer. However, to show a concrete relationship, a statistical model with an appropriate hierarchy and adjustment for potential confounding factors is required.",Excluded
1625,"Shifts in broadband power and alpha peak frequency observed during long-term isolation. Prolonged periods of social isolation and spatial confinement do not only represent an issue that needs to be faced by a few astronauts during space missions, but can affect all of us as recently shown during pandemic situations. The fundamental question, how the brain adapts to periods of sensory deprivation and re-adapts to normality, has only received little attention. Here, we use eyes closed and eyes open resting-state electroencephalographic (EEG) recordings to investigate how neural activity is altered during 120 days of isolation in a spatially confined, space-analogue environment. After disentangling oscillatory patterns from 1/f activity, we show that isolation leads to a reduction in broadband power and a flattening of the 1/f spectral slope. Beyond that, we observed a reduction in alpha peak frequency during isolation, but did not find strong evidence for isolation-induced changes that are of oscillatory nature. Critically, all effects reversed upon release from isolation. These findings suggest that isolation and concomitant sensory deprivation lead to an enhanced cortical deactivation which might be explained by a reduction in the mean neuronal population firing rate.",Excluded

1002,"Some radiation effects on segregation in Drosophila. Translocation induced in the immature oocyte, in meiotic prophase, affects division I orientation and segregation, the usual result being that the two halves of translocations are directed to opposite poles. Since interchange is usually (if not exclusively) between chromatids, this is to be expected from the creation of illegitimate conjunctions. Good agreement is obtained between patterns of segregations deduced from recovered half-translocation bearing exceptions and the kinds of disomic gametes expected as alternative recoveries from the same division I configurations. Inferences drawn from the study of compound-X females have been found to apply as well in the case of females of normal karyotype. Numerical errors occur predominantly, possibly exclusively, in division I. The rate of induced nondisjunction of specific chromosome pairs varies in relation to the structure of the entire complement, as required if radiation-induced nondisjunction is interchange dependent, but which would be unexpected if the mechanism involved effects on individual spindle fibers, chromosomes, or chromosomal bivalents.",Excluded
290,"Feasibility study of postoperative intraperitoneal hyperthermochemotherapy by radiofrequency capacitive heating system for advanced gastric cancer with peritoneal seeding. Background: Gastric carcinoma patients with peritoneal dissemination have an extremely poor prognosis. Attempting to improve regional control and decrease the risk of complications related to hyperthermic chemotherapy, we applied a new treatment modality using a combination of gastrectomy with postoperative intraperitoneal hyperthermo-chemotherapy (PIHC) using Thermotron RF-8. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the feasibility of PIHC in advanced gastric carcinoma patients with peritoneal seeding. Patients and Methods: Between March 2002 and April 2006, 20 gastric carcinoma patients with peritoneal dissemination were allocated to two groups in the patient's selection. The PIHC group (10 patients) received a 60-min PIHC with a cisplatin dose of 80 mg/m2 two weeks after surgery, and the control group (10 patients) received surgery alone. Thermotron RF-8 is a heating device that can raise temperatures in both superficial and deep-seated tumours using 8 MHz radiofrequency electromagnetic waves as a source of heat. Result(s): No patients in either group had life-threatening complications. The most frequent nonhaematologic toxicity (grade 3) was nausea. The one-, two-, and three-year cumulative survival rates for the PIHC group were 60%, 48%, and 36%, respectively, whereas those for the control group were 40%, 10%, and 0%, respectively. The survival rates for the PIHC group were significantly higher than those for the control group. Conclusion(s): Although this study was conducted non-randomly with a small number of patients, the PIHC group had a higher survival rate and better prognosis compared with the control group.",Excluded
3201,"Phase I trial of concurrent hyperfractionated split course radiotherapy (HFx RT), cisplatin (cDDP), and paclitaxel in patients with recurrent, previously irradiated, or treatment-naive locally advanced upper aerodigestive malignancy. Purpose: Phase I study to determine the maximally tolerated dose (MTD) of cisplatin (cDDP), paclitaxel (P), and concurrent split course hyperfractionated (BID) RT in advanced squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck (SCCHN) and other upper aerodigestive tumors. Material(s) and Method(s): Eligibility stipulated ECOG performance status 0-2 and either Tx-naive, locally advanced, or locally recurrent, previously radiated, surgically unresectable upper aerodigestive cancer. Metastases were permitted if disease was predominantly locoregional. RT-naive patients received 150 cGy bid x 5 d Q 2 wks x 4. Previously radiated patients received 150 cGy bid x 5, wk 1; then 120 cGy bid x 5 Q 2 wk x 3 (later increased to 150 cGy BID for the entire treatment). Treatment fields included recurrent tumor only with 2 cm margins. Whenever possible, conventional and 3-D conformal techniques were used. Elective nodal radiation was not administered. Starting doses of cDDP and P were 12 mg/m 2/d x 5 and 15 mg/m2/d x 5, respectively, Q 2 wk x 4, each given on RT days only. At dose level 2, cDDP was increased to 15 mg/m 2/d x 5. At dose level 3, P was increased to 20 mg/m2/d x 5. Granulocyte colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) days 6-12 (off treatment week) was added if cumulative neutropenia precipitated treatment delays. Result(s): Thirty-one patients (21 men, 10 women) were treated. Eight had received prior chemotherapy, 27 prior RT. At dose level three, regular treatment delays of >=1 week due to slow neutrophil recovery occurred. Addition of G-CSF (dose level 3b) reduced treatment delays from 100 percent to 28 percent and decreased the incidence of Grade >=2 neutropenia and mucositis. Six of 7 patients at this dose level completed all 4 cycles of treatment and all received full dose RT (60 Gy). No other dose-limiting toxicities occurred. Of 22 assessable patients with locally recurrent SCCHN, 12 (55 percent) responded. Median time to progression in this group was 6 months, with median and one-year survival of 9.5 mos and 41 percent, respectively. Conclusion(s): Concurrent daily cisplatin/paclitaxel and split course hyperfractionated RT (60 Gy) is feasible in previously radiated patients. G-CSF, administered between each cycle, reduces the incidence of treatment delays. Activity is promising and toxicity acceptable. Copyright © Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",Excluded
3703,"Tolerance of centrifuge-simulated suborbital spaceflight by medical condition. Introduction: We examined responses of volunteers with known medical disease to G forces in a centrifuge to evaluate how potential commercial spaceflight participants (SFPs) might tolerate the forces of spaceflight despite significant medical history. Method(s): Volunteers were recruited based upon suitability for each of five disease categories (hypertension, cardiovascular disease, diabetes, lung disease, back or neck problems) or a control group. Subjects underwent seven centrifuge runs over 2 d. Day 1 consisted of two +Gz runs (peak 5 +3.5 Gz, Run 2) and two +Gx runs (peak = +6.0 Gx, Run 4). Day 2 consisted of three runs approximating suborbital spaceflight profiles (combined +Gx and +Gz, peak = +6.0 Gx/+4.0 Gz). Data collected included blood pressure, electrocardiogram, pulse oximetry, neurovestibular exams, and post-run questionnaires regarding motion sickness, disorientation, grayout, and other symptoms. Result(s): A total of 335 subjects registered for participation, of which 86 (63 men, 23 women, age 20-78 yr) participated in centrifuge trials. The most common causes for disqualification were weight and severe and uncontrolled medical or psychiatric disease. Five subjects voluntarily withdrew from the second day of testing: three for anxiety reasons, one for back strain, and one for time constraints. Maximum hemodynamic values recorded included HR of 192 bpm, systolic BP of 217 mmHg, and diastolic BP of 144 mmHg. Common subjective complaints included grayout (69%), nausea (20%), and chest discomfort (6%). Despite their medical history, no subject experienced significant adverse physiological responses to centrifuge profiles. Discussion(s): These results suggest that most individuals with well-controlled medical conditions can withstand acceleration forces of launch and re-entry profiles of current commercial spaceflight vehicles. © By the Aerospace Medical Association, Alexandria, VA.",Excluded

BACKGROUND: Assessment of palliative effect of hemibody irradiation (HBI) and response-related factors., METHODS: Analysis of prospective collected data of 78 procedures on 71 patients with multiple symptomatic bone metastases, treated with 6 Gy (upper half-body) or 8 Gy (lower half-body) HBI in single fraction. Clinical improvement was quantified by self-evaluation on a visual analogic scale (SVAS) before HBI, and at 24, 48 and 72 hours, at 7 days, and at each monthly control until patient's death. Univariate analysis included: sex, Karnofsky's index, tumor origin, histology, HBI dose, and SVAS before treatment. For statistical purposes the significance level was 0.05., RESULTS: Complete (37.5%) or partial responses were observed in 72/78 (92.3%) procedures, 80% appearing during the first 72 hours. Difference between mean SVAS, before and after treatment (7.7 +/- 1.5 vs 2.8 +/- 2.5), was statistically significant (p < 0.001). A mean response duration of 101 days over a mean overall survival of 141 days implies the 70% of expected patient's life span. Any analyzed prognostic factor does not correlate significantly with HBI response., CONCLUSIONS: HBI is a powerful palliative treatment in patients with multiple symptomatic bone metastasis.",Excluded

The aim of this study was to evaluate the feasibility of using the gamma probe to intraoperatively identify the ureters after intravenous injection of a radiopharmaceutical agent. Study Design: Ten patients undergoing elective abdominal operations were prospectively enrolled in this study. An average dose of 4.5 mCi (range 2.8 to 5.3 mCi) of technetium Tc 99m-labeled diethylenetriamine pentaacetic acid (99mTc-DTPA) was administered intravenously before localization of the ureters. The gamma probe was used to localize the ureters. Correct identification of the ureters was confirmed when gentle manipulation induced a typical ureteral peristaltic pattern. Result(s): Gamma counts were significantly elevated in all ureters examined. Compared with background counts, gamma counts were increased over the ureter in all patients, with an average increase of 465%. The technique was modified after use in the first 3 patients and standardized for patients 4 through 10. Data from those seven patients were analyzed. Both ureters were correctly identified using the gamma probe at a mean of 15 minutes (median, 10 minutes) after a single 99mTc-DTPA injection (range 4 to 41 minutes). The mean background count was 80 counts per second (cps, range 50 to 130 cps). The mean ureter count was 393 cps (range 128 to 700 cps). The average percent increase of each ureter count compared with its specific background count was 465% (range 256% to 1,077%). The difference was statistically significant for all values (p < 0.001).

3338,"Stereotactic single-dose radiotherapy (radiosurgery) of early stage nonsmall-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). BACKGROUND. The clinical results after stereotactic single-dose radiotherapy of nonsmall-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) stages I and II were evaluated. METHODS. Forty-two patients with biopsy-proven NSCLC received stereotactic radiotherapy. Patients were treated in a stereotactic body frame and breathing motion was reduced by abdominal compression. The single doses used ranged between 19 and 30 Gy/isocenter. RESULTS. After a median follow-up period of 15 months (range, 1.5-72 months) the actuarial overall survival rates and disease-free survival rates were 74.5%, 65.4%, 37.4%, and 70.2%, 49.1%, 49.1% at 12, 24, and 36 months after therapy, respectively. The actuarial local tumor control rates were 89.5%, 67.9%, and 67.9% at 12, 24, and 36 months after therapy, respectively. A significant difference (P = .032) in local tumor control was found for patients receiving 26-30 Gy (n = 32) compared with doses of less than 26 Gy (n = 10). The effect of the tumor volume on local tumor control was also evaluated. Although the difference was not statistically significant (P = .078), the subgroup of tumors with a tumor volume of less than 12 cm3 (n = 10) experienced no tumor recurrence. Thirteen (31%) patients developed metastases during follow-up, whereas isolated regional lymph node recurrence was only encountered in 2 patients. No clinically significant treatment-associated side effects were documented. CONCLUSIONS. Stereotactic single-dose radiotherapy is a safe and effective treatment option for patients with early stage NSCLC not suitable for surgery. Especially for small tumor volumes it seems to be equally effective as hypofractionated radiotherapy, while minimizing the overall treatment time. © 2007 American Cancer Society.",Excluded
2949,"[Comparison of radiation dose reduction of prospective ECG-gated one beat scan using 320 area detector CT coronary angiography and prospective ECG-gated helical scan with high helical pitch (FlashScan) using 64 multidetector-row CT coronary angiography]. A high radiation dose associated with 64 multidetector-row computed tomography (64-MDCT) is a major concern for physicians and patients alike. A new 320 row area detector computed tomography (ADCT) can obtain a view of the entire heart with one rotation (0.35 s) without requiring the helical method. As such, ADCT is expected to reduce the radiation dose. We studied image quality and radiation dose of ADCT compared to that of 64-MDCT in patients with a low heart rate (HR<=60). Three hundred eighty-five consecutive patients underwent 64-MDCT and 379 patients, ADCT. Patients with an arrhythmia were excluded. Prospective ECG-gated helical scan with high HP (FlashScan) in 64 was used for MDCT and prospective ECG-gated conventional one beat scan, for 320-ADCT. Image quality was visually evaluated by an image quality score. Radiation dose was estimated by DLP (mGycm) for 64-MDCT and DLP.e (mGycm) for 320-ADCT. Radiation dose of 320-ADCT (208+/-48 mGycm) was significantly (P<0.0001) lower than that of 64-MDCT (484+/-112 mGycm), and image quality score of 320-ADCT (3.0+/-0.2) was significantly (P=0.0011) higher than that of 64-MDCT (2.9+/-0.4). Scan time of 320-ADCT (1.4+/-0.1 s) was also significantly (P<0.0001) shorter than that of 64-MDCT (6.8+/-0.6 s). 320-ADCT can achieve not only a reduction in radiation dose but also a superior image quality and shortening of scan time compared to 64-MDCT.",Excluded

Introduction: The occipitocervical junction presents a unique, complex, biomechanical interface between the cranium and the upper cervical spine. Occipitocervical fixation has undergone significant evolution due to advances in operative techniques and instrumentation techniques. Objective(s): This study was done to evaluate clinical picture, radiographic findings and results of occipitocervical fusion in 10 patients with craniocervical instabilities. Also to compare these results with other results reported in the literature. Method(s): This retrospective study reviewed 10 patients who underwent occipitocervical fixation for craniocervical instabilities between April 2007 and October 2010 in Alexandria hospitals. There were 7 males and 3 females and their ages ranged from 16 to 63. years with mean age of 42.1. years. As regards the clinical presentation, all patients had presented with neck pain before surgery, 8 patients (80%) with myelopathy, and 8 patients (80%) had presented with a neurological deficit either motor or sensory or both. The etiologies of occipitocervical instability in this study were trauma in three patients, rheumatoid arthritis in three patients, tumor in two patients and Down syndrome in two patients. All patients had preoperative craniocervical plain X-ray, CT and MRI examination. All patients underwent occipitocervical fixation surgery with various fixation systems and autologous bone grafts for fusion. Fusion was assessed by plain cervical X-ray films and CT scan, and the neurological outcome by Frankel grade. The mean follow-up period was 14.7. months (range, 4-24. months) including both clinical and radiological examinations. Result(s): There were no operative mortalities or vascular injuries in this series. Two patients showed transient neurological deterioration postoperatively that had resolved within three months. Two cases had superficial wound infection and one case had cerebrospinal fluid leak. The mean operation time was 207. min (range 130-320. min) and the mean volume of blood loss was 354. mL (range 120-750. mL). Neck pain improved in all patients and no new instability developed at adjacent levels. Regarding the Frankel grade, five patients had shown improvement (Three patients improved from Frankel grade C to grade D, one patient from grade A to grade B and one patient from grade D to grade E), while five patients remained stationary at the same grade. At the last follow-up examination period, a solid fusion was achieved in nine patients out of ten (90%). Conclusion(s): Occiptocervical fixation is indicated in the management of craniocervical instabilities resulting from trauma, rheumatoid arthritis, tumors and congenital anomalies of the craniocervical junction. Accurate imaging studies and proper patient selection are the keys to a successful outcome. Occipitocervical fusion procedures can be performed with low morbidity. A comprehensive knowledge of the anatomy of the occipital-cervical junction is imperative.

531,"Manual adjustment of tube voltage from 120 to 100 kVp during abdominal CT in patients with body weights <=75 kg: assessment of image quality and radiation dose in a prospective, randomised trial. AIM: To assess image quality and radiation dose in patients with body weights <=75 kg undergoing abdominal computed tomography (CT) with a tube voltage of either 120 or 100 kVp., MATERIALS AND METHODS: Eighty patients weighing <=75 kg were prospectively assigned to receive either 120 or 100 kVp abdominal CT in the portal-venous phase. Attenuation values of abdominal organs and image noise were measured, and the contrast-to-noise ratios (CNRs) were calculated. Subjective image quality was assessed by three independent radiologists. Radiation exposure was assessed by size-specific dose estimate (SSDE)., RESULTS: The mean attenuation of the kidney increased by 20% at 100 kVp (p<0.0001), and the mean image noise was 27% higher in the 100 kVp (p=0.003). The CNR did not significantly differ between the groups (120 kVp, 6.6+/-2.8; 100 kVp, 7.4+/-3.6; p=0.26). Except for subjective image noise (p<0.001), no other subjective quality parameters (e.g., contrast, artefacts) were significantly different between the two groups (p between 0.094 and 0.761). The mean SSDE in the 100-kVp group (9.8+/-1.8 mGy) was reduced by 19% compared to the 120-kVp group (12.1+/-1.8 mGy; p<0.0001)., CONCLUSION: Manual reduction of tube voltage from the standard 120 to 100 kVp for portal-venous phase CT in patients with body weights <=75 kg resulted in a 19% dose reduction while maintaining objective and subjective image quality.

Method(s): Data of 27,624 patients with PPI exposure followed by new-onset AMI development were extracted from Taiwan National Health Insurance Research Database and age- and sex-matched with 27,624 controls with PPIs exposure, but without subsequent AMI and ischemic heart disease development. The amount of PPI exposure was calculated based on the cumulative defined daily dose (cDDD) during the follow-up period. Subsequent AMI risk was measured after adjustments of demographic data and indication of PPI use. Result(s): AMI risk increased with an increase in PPI exposure: with cDDD <= 30 as the reference, the odds ratios (95% confidence intervals) for cDDDs of > 365 was 1.56 (1.45-1.69). All five PPI categories, including pantoprazole, lansoprazole, omeprazole, esomeprazole, and rabeprazole, increased AMI risk.

Background: Chronic radiation proctopathy (CRP) is a troublesome complication of radiotherapy to the pelvis for which current treatment modalities are suboptimal. Currently, the application of formalin to the rectal mucosa (AFR) and thermal ablation with argon plasma coagulation (APC) are the most promising options. Objective(s): To compare the efficacy and safety of AFR with APC for CRP. Patients and Methods: Records of 22 patients (male to female ratio, 19:3; mean age, 74 years) who received either APC or AFR for chronic hematochezia caused by CRP, and who were evaluated and treated between May 1998 and April 2002, were reviewed. Complete evaluations were made three months after completion of each therapeutic modality. Patients were considered to be responders if there was a 10% increase in hemoglobin from baseline or complete normalization of hemoglobin (male patients, higher than 130 g/L; female patients, higher than 115 g/L) without the requirement for blood transfusion. Result(s): The mean hemoglobin level before therapy was 107 g/L. Patients received an average of 1.78 sessions for APC and 1.81 sessions for AFR. Eleven patients (50%) were treated with APC alone, eight patients (36%) with AFR alone and three (14%) with both modalities (two with AFR followed by APC, and one with APC followed by AFR). Eleven of 14 patients (79%) in the APC group were responders, compared with three of 11 patients (27%) in the AFR group (P=0.017). In the APC group, seven of 11 responders required only a single session, while in the AFR group, only one patient responded after a single session. Adverse events (nausea, vomiting, flushing, abdominal cramps, rectal pain and fever) occurred in two patients after APC and in nine patients after AFR (P=0.001). In the APC group, the mean hemoglobin level increase was 20 g/ L at three months follow-up, compared with 14 g/L in the AFR group. Conclusion(s): This retrospective study suggests that APC is more effective and safe than topical AFR to control hematochezia caused by CRP.

2790,"Abdominal applications of 3.0-T MR imaging: comparative review versus a 1.5-T system. With the development of dedicated receiver coils and increased gradient performance, 3.0-T magnetic resonance (MR) systems are gaining wider acceptance in clinical practice. The expected twofold increase in signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) compared with that of 1.5-T MR systems may help improve spatial resolution or increase temporal resolution when used with parallel acquisition techniques. Several issues must be considered when applying 3.0-T MR in the abdomen, including the alteration of the radiofrequency field and relaxation time, increase in energy deposition and susceptibility effects, and problems associated with motion artifacts. For the evaluation of liver lesions, higher SNR and greater resolution achieved with the 3.0-T system could translate into better detection of malignant lesions on T2-weighted images obtained with adjusted imaging parameters. For the evaluation of pancreatic and biliary diseases, high-resolution T2-weighted imaging using single-shot turbo spin-echo sequences is useful; improvement in SNR was noticeable on two-dimensional MR cholangiopancreatographic images. For the preoperative imaging of rectal cancer, a single-shot sequence is useful for dramatically decreasing imaging time while maintaining image quality. Substantial modification of examination protocols, with optimized imaging parameters and sequence designs along with ongoing development of hardware, could contribute to an increased role of the 3.0-T system for abdominal MR examinations.",Excluded

This study explored a point-to-point coaxial guide apparatus assisting the transiliac-transsacral screw insertion and aimed to investigate the feasibility and accuracy of the guide apparatus in the treatment of posterior ring unstable pelvic fracture compared with a free-hand technique. METHOD(S): A retrospective study was performed to evaluate patients treated with transiliac-transsacral screws assisted by the point-to-point coaxial guide apparatus or free-hand technique. The intraoperative data of operative time and radiation exposure times were recorded. Postoperative radiographs and CT scans were performed to scrutinize the accuracy of screws position. The quality of the postoperative fracture reduction was assessed according to Matta radiology criteria. The pelvic function was assessed according to the Majeed scoring criteria at 6 months postoperatively. RESULT(S): From July 2017 to December 2019, a total of 38 patients were included in this study, 20 from the point-to-point guide apparatus group and 18 from the free-hand group. There were no significant differences between the two groups in gender, age, injury causes, pelvic fracture type, screws level, and follow-up time (P > 0.05). The average operative time of the guide apparatus group for each screw was significantly less than that in the free-hand group (25.8 +/- 4.7 min vs 40.5 +/- 5.1, P < 0.001).

Objective: To investigate the image quality and nodules detectability using ultra-low dose (ULD) protocol with iterative model reconstruction (IMR) algorithm when compared to routine low dose (LD) chest CT in lung cancer screening. methods: Chest CT scans were acquired using a 256-slice scanner for 300 subjects. The scan protocol for the ULD group was 120 kVp/17 mAs while for the LD group was 120 kVp/30 mAs. All images were reconstructed with filtered back projection (FBP), hybrid iterative reconstruction (HIR) and IMR algorithms. Effective dose was recorded. Image quality assessments were performed by two radiologists. SD of CT attenuation was measured as objective image noise. The number of non-calcified nodules detected in both groups with different reconstruction algorithms were calculated and compared. Result(s): The effective dose of ULD group (0.67 +/- 0.08mSv) was about 44% reduced compared with LD group (1.20 +/- 0.08mSv) (p < 0.01). IMR improved image quality and reduced image noise significantly than HIR and FBP in both groups (all, p < 0.01). IMR enabled a higher number of nodule detected compared to FBP and HIR in both LD and ULD groups, especially for solid nodules less than 4mm. conclusion: IMR may improve the diagnostic accuracy of ULD CT lung screening with potential nodule detectability improvement. advances in knowledge: IMR enables significant reduction of the image noise and improvement of image quality in sub-mSv (66% reduction) chest scans.Copyright © 2017 The Authors.

1131,"Biochemical changes in irradiated oral mucosa: A FTIR spectroscopic study. Radiation exposure during the course of treatment in head and neck cancer (HNC) patients can induce both structural and biochemical anomalies. The present study is focused on utilizing infrared imaging for the identification of the minor biochemical alterations in the oral mucosa. Chemical maps generated using glycoprotein band indicates its differential distribution along the superficial layer. Spectra extracted from this layer suggests changes in overall nucleic acid and protein content in response to the therapeutic irradiation. Discrimination among control and irradiated groups have been achieved using principal component analysis. Findings of this preliminary study further support prospective utilization of Fourier Transform InfraRed (FTIR) imaging as a non-destructive, label-free tool for objective assessment of the oral mucosa in patient groups with or without radiation therapy.Copyright © 2019 MDPI AG.

1072,"An action spectrum (290-320 nm) for TNFalpha protein in human skin in vivo suggests that basal-layer epidermal DNA is the chromophore. Terrestrial solar UVB radiation (=295-320 nm) readily induces cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers (CPDs) in human skin DNA that result in characteristic mutations associated with nonmelanoma skin cancer. The proinflammatory cytokine TNFalpha is important in mouse skin chemical carcinogenesis and is thought to also play a role in UVR-induced skin cancer by its immunomodulatory properties. There is some in vitro evidence that CPDs initiate the production of TNFalpha, and we tested this hypothesis by comparing the wavelength dependence (action spectrum) for TNFalpha protein induction in human skin in vivo with our earlier in vivo action spectra for CPD induction in four different epidermal layers of human skin. Normal volunteers (n = 35) were irradiated with physiologically relevant doses of monochromatic UVB (290-320 nm), and TNFalpha concentration was assessed, by high-sensitivity ELISA, in exudates from skin suction blisters raised 8 h after irradiation. An action spectrum, constructed from the slopes of the dose-response curves at the different wavelengths, showed maximal efficacy at 300 nm. An excellent match was observed for TNFalpha and the CPD action spectrum for cells in the lower basal epidermis. These data strongly suggest that UVB-induced photodamage to DNA in the epidermal basal layer is a major trigger for TNFalpha production. The TNFalpha may originate directly from the keratinocytes in this layer or inflammatory cells that are rapidly recruited into the upper dermis (e.g., neutrophils) as a consequence of DNA photodamage to basal-layer keratinocytes. © 2007 by The National Academy of Sciences of the USA.",Excluded
383,"Analysis of biologically equivalent dose of stereotactic body radiotherapy for primary and metastatic lung tumors. Purpose: The purpose of this study was to determine the optimal biologically equivalent dose (BED) for stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) by comparing local control rates in proportion to various total doses and fractionation schedules. Material(s) and Method(s): Thirty-four patients with early non-small-cell lung cancer and a single metastatic lung tumor were included in this study. Differences in local control rates were evaluated according to gender, primary tumor site, response, tumor size, and BED. For comparison of BEDs, the prescribed dose for SBRT was stratified according to three groups: high (BED > 146 Gy), medium to high (BED, 106 to 146 Gy), and low to medium (BED < 106 Gy). Result(s): For all patients, the overall local control rate was 85.3% at two years after treatment. Five local recurrences were observed, and, notably, all of them were observed in the low to medium BED group. Significantly higher local control rates were observed for patients with a complete response than for those with a partial response or stable disease (p < 0.001). Twenty-six patients with a tumor size of < 3 cm showed no dose-response relationship in the low to medium, medium to high, and high BED groups, whereas eight patients with a tumor size of = 3 cm showed a significant dose-response relationship. The observed 2-year local recurrence-free survival rates in patients with a tumor size of < 3 cm and in those with a tumor size of = 3 cm were 96.2% and 50.0%, respectively, which were significantly different (p=0.007). Conclusion(s): BED > 100 Gy is required in order to achieve a > 85% local control rate regardless of tumor size. The optimal dose for small tumors of < 3 cm appears to be within a range below 150 Gy BED. Escalation of BED to high levels (> 150 Gy) may be required for patients with a tumor size larger than 3 cm.Copyright © 2014 by the Korean Cancer Association.",Excluded
2245,"Gamma Knife radiosurgery combined with stereotactic aspiration as an effective treatment method for large cystic brain metastases. In the present study, the efficacy and clinical outcomes of stereotactic aspiration combined with the Gamma Knife radiosurgery (GKRS) method were evaluated retrospectively for patients with large cystic brain metastases. This combined method aims to decrease the tumor weight (volume) and increase the possible radiation dose. The present study involved 48 patients who were diagnosed with cystic metastatic brain tumors between January 2008 and December 2012 in the Department of Neurosurgery of Nanfang Hospital Southern Medical University (Guangzhou, China). Every patient underwent Leksell stereotactic frame, 1.5T magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)-guided stereotactic cyst aspiration and Leksell GKRS. Subsequent to the therapy, MRI was performed every 3 months. The results indicated that 48 cases were followed up for 24-72 months, with a mean follow-up duration of 36.2 months. Following treatment, 44 patients (91.7%) exhibited tumor control and 4 patients (8.3%) experienced progression of the local tumor. During this period, 35 patients (72.9%) succumbed, but only 2 (4.2%) of these succumbed to the brain metastases. The total local control rate was 91.7% and the median overall survival time of all patients was 19.5 months. The 1-year overall survival rate was 70.8% and the 2-year overall survival rate was 26.2%. In conclusion, these results indicated that the method of stereotactic cyst aspiration combined with GKRS was safe and effective for patients with large cystic brain metastases. This method is effective for patients whose condition is too weak for general anesthesia and in whom the tumors are positioned at eloquent areas. This method enables patients to avoid a craniotomy, and provides a good tumor control rate, survival time and quality of life.Copyright © 2016, Spandidos Publications. All rights reserved.",Excluded
2263,"Hippocampal avoidance with volumetric modulated arc therapy in melanoma brain metastases - the first Australian experience. PURPOSE: Volumetric modulated arc therapy (VMAT) can deliver intensity modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) like dose distributions in a short time; this allows the expansion of IMRT treatments to palliative situations like brain metastases (BMs). VMAT can deliver whole brain radiotherapy (WBRT) with hippocampal avoidance and a simultaneous integrated boost (SIB) to achieve stereotactic radiotherapy (SRT) for BMs. This study is an audit of our experience in the treatment of brain metastases with VMAT in our institution., METHODS AND MATERIALS: Metastases were volumetrically contoured on fused diagnostic gadolinium enhanced T1 weighted MRI/planning CT images. Risk organs included hippocampus, optic nerve, optic chiasm, eye, and brain stem. The hippocampi were contoured manually as one paired organ with assistance from a neuroradiologist. WBRT and SIB were integrated into a single plan., RESULTS: Thirty patients with 73 BMs were treated between March 2010 and February 2012 with VMAT. Mean follow up time was 3.5 months. For 26 patients, BMs arose from primary melanoma and for the remaining four patients from non-small cell lung cancer (n= 2), primary breast cancer, and sarcoma. Mean age was 60 years. The male to female ratio was 2:1. Five patients were treated without hippocampal avoidance (HA) intent. The median WBRT dose was 31 Gy with a median SIB dose for BMs of 50 Gy, given over a median of 15 fractions. Mean values for BMs were as follows: GTV = 6.9 cc, PTV = 13.3 cc, conformity index = 8.6, homogeneity index = 1.06. Mean and maximum hippocampus dose was 20.4 Gy, and 32.4 Gy, respectively, in patients treated with HA intent. Mean VMAT treatment time from beam on to beam off for one fraction was 3.43 minutes, which compared to WBRT time of 1.3 minutes. Twenty out of 25 assessable lesions at the time of analysis were controlled. Treatment was well tolerated; grade 4 toxicity was reported in one patient. The median overall survival was 9.40 months, CONCLUSIONS: VMAT for BMs is feasible, safe and associated with a similar survival times and toxicities to conventional SRT+/-WBRT. The advantage of VMAT is that WBRT and SRT can be delivered at the same time on one machine.",Excluded
565,"Value of spiral high-resolution CT in the diagnosis of bronchiectasis: Comparison with HRCT. Purpose: We aimed to evaluate the contribution of spiral HRCT (sHRCT) to the detection of bronchiectasis by comparing if with HRCT. Method(s): 16 patients with suspected bronchiectasis underwent HRCT examination (2 mm, 10 mm interval) of the whole chest. Selected areas of the chest, where HRCT had depicted certain or suspected bronchiectasis, were reexamined by sHRCT (slice thickness 2 mm, table feed 2 mm/sec) at the same session. Corresponding HRCT and sHRCT slices were matched. The data was analysed for the presence, diagnostic criteria, extent and severity of bronchiectasis as well as the additional information in sHRCT. Result(s): 81 observation sets were evaluated in 16 patients. Number of sets with bronchiectasis was 58 in sHRCT and 49 in HRCT. The sensitivity of HRCT to detect bronchiectasis when compared with sHRCT was 84%. sHRCT was superior to HRCT in the demonstration of the pulmonary artery accompanying the dilated bronchus, hence the signet-ring appearance; in the detection of the lack of bronchial tapering and in the assessment of extent of bronchiectasis. Conclusion(s): sHRCT not only provides additional diagnostic information, but also increases the subjective level of confidence in the interpretation. Although sHRCT is superior to HRCT to detect bronchiectasis: its use should be limited to selected areas of the lung because of the increased risk of radiation exposure.",Excluded
2108,"Reduced ultraviolet-induced DNA damage and apoptosis in human skin with topical application of a photolyase-containing DNA repair enzyme cream: Clues to skin cancer prevention. The exposure of human skin to ultraviolet radiation (UVR) results in the formation of DNA photolesions that give rise to photoaging, mutations, cell death and the onset of carcinogenic events. Photolyase (EC 4.1.99.3) is a DNA repair enzyme that reverses damage caused by exposure to UVR. We sought to investigate whether addition of photolyase enhances the protection provided by a traditional sunscreen (SS), by reducing the in vivo formation of cyclobutane-type pyrimidine dimers (CPDs) and UVR-induced apoptosis in human skin. Ten volunteers (Fitzpatrick skin type II) were exposed to solar-simulated (ss) UVR at a three times minimal erythema dose for 4 consecutive days. Thirty minutes prior to each exposure, the test materials [vehicle, SS (sun protection factor 50) alone, and SS plus photolyase from Anacystis nidulans] were applied topically to three different sites. One additional site was left untreated and one received ssUVR only. Biopsy specimens were taken 72 h after the last irradiation. The amount of CPDs and the extent of apoptosis were measured by ELISA. Photolyase plus SS was superior to SS alone in reducing both the formation of CPDs and apoptotic cell death (both P<0.001). In conclusion, the addition of photolyase to a traditional SS contributes significantly to the prevention of UVR-induced DNA damage and apoptosis when applied topically to human skin.",Excluded
2957,"[Occurrence of immune hyperthyroidism after radioiodine therapy of autonomous goiter]. AIM: The goal of the study was to examine the prevalence of Graves' disease following I-131 treatment of autonomous goiter with special regard to pretreatment scintigraphic patterns., PATIENTS AND METHOD: Pre- and posttreatment in-vitro and in-vivo parameters were studied in 375 consecutive patients treated with I-131 therapy for nodular or diffuse autonomous goiter. All patients included were within ambulant control for at least 2.5 months following treatment. According to the pretreatment Tc-99m pertechnetate scan 59% (220/375) had multifocal (MF), 23% (86/375) unifocal (UF), 10% (38/375) mixed focal-disseminated (FD) and 8% (31/375) disseminated (D) scintigraphic patterns., RESULTS: In 93.9% (352/375), the autonomous tissue was totally, in 2.1% (8/375) partially and in 1.6% (6/375) insufficiently eliminated. In 2.4% (9/375) a relapse of hyperthyroidism was observed 2 to 10 months following I-131 therapy. In 8 patients a relapse of hyperthyroidism was accompanied or followed by an elevation of the previously non-elevated TSH-receptor antibody (TRAb) level and in 1 patient by an TRAb increase to the upper borderline range implicating Graves' disease. With the prevalence of Graves' disease following I-131 therapy a statistically significant difference in pretreatment Tc-99m pertechnetate scintigraphic patterns was found: 0% of unifocal (0/86) or multifocal (0/220), however 18% (7/38) of focal-disseminated and 7% (2/31) of disseminated scintigraphic patterns. From the 366 patients without relapse of hyperthyroidism 2 (MF) had elevated pre- and posttreatment TRAb levels and 3 (D) had elevated TRAb levels for the first time after I-131 therapy., CONCLUSION: There is a low overall prevalence (2.4%) of Graves' disease following I-131 therapy for nodular or diffuse autonomous goiter. However, the prevalence of posttreatment Graves' disease is highly dependent upon pretreatment scintigraphic patterns exhibiting focal-disseminated or disseminated patterns.",Excluded
3,"Analysis of entrance surface dose in general radiographies using body mass index classification. Dose audit is an important topic in radiology and variations in dose attributable to sex have not been fully investigated. The primary purpose of our study was to determine the entrance surface dose (ESD) for men and women, from which we established an easy estimation equation for ESD, using the body mass index (BMI) as a variable. From April 2000 to March 2002, 15424 patients (8586 men, 6838 women; mean age, 58 years old; age range, 20 to 90 years old) were recruited in this study. Estimated equation of ESD was obtained from the dispersion data of BMI and ESD. Welch's t-test was used as the test of significance. P values evaluated levels of significance at 5%. Analysis for correlation coefficients was used for Peason's correlation coefficient test. And, we also performed a simple regression analysis. The results of the simple regression equation with BMI as variable (y: ESD [mGy], x: BMI [kg/m(2)), and the median values of ESD were as follows: for chest PA, men, 0.22, y = 0.0145 x - 0.0876, women, 0.20, y = 0.0126 x - 0.0704; for abdomen AP, men, 2.12, y = 0.2707 x - 3.7206, women, 1.65, y = 0.2561 x - 3.7989; for pelvis AP, men, 1.87, y = 0.0517 x + 0.8753, women, 1.77, y = 0.0674 x + 0.4775; for lumbar spine AP, men, 3.08, y = 0.3462 x - 4.1416, women, 2.66, y = 0.2525 x - 2.8131; and for lumbar spine lateral, men, 9.31, y = 0.6012 x - 3.7216, women, 7.42, y = 0.3147 x + 0.3384.

Purpose: To determine possibilities of photodynamic therapy (PDT) with non-coherent light sources in the blue range of the spectrum for treating streptostaphylodermias. Previously performed microbiological and spectrophotometric studies andexperimental work with animals have helped the author to choose photosensitisers and light sources for the present clinical trials. Material(s) and Method(s): PDT was done in 62-patients with superficial forms of streptostaphylodermias (28 men and-34 women) aged 17-58. In the control group there were 58 patients (27 men and 31 women) who had traditional therapy. In PDT treatment 1% gel of photosensitizer Photoditazin was applied at skin lesions one hour before irradiation. Light-emitting diode therapeutic apparatus ""AST"" (registration number FSR-2008/02720) generating light at the range 400-410nm (in the Sore band), power 500 mWt was used as a light source. 3 sessions a week, irradiation time 5-7 min at 5 cm distance. Results were assessed by changes in clinical picture, by biophotometric findings (with biophotometer ""Milta-08 1""). Changes were also fixed by a photocamera. Result(s): During the trial complete regression of skin rash was seen in 81% patients, considerable improvement in 27.5%; no changes in 11% after 4-8 PDT sessions (1.5-2.5 weeks after treatment beginning); in the control group 18%, 59% and 62%, correspondently.

Purpose/Objective(s): The purpose of this study was to evaluate the longterm treatment outcomes and patterns of failure in patients with primary ocular adnexal mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) lymphoma treated with involved-field radiation therapy. Materials/Methods: Patients who were pathologically diagnosed as Stage IE/IIE ocular adnexal MALT lymphoma and underwent radiation therapy were retrospectively analyzed. Since 2006, 55 patients received radiation therapy and were followed up for more than 6 months at our institution. At initial presentation, 53 patients had Stage IE disease and two had Stage IIE disease. There were 28 men and 27 women. The median age was 66 years (range, 39-90 years). Local control (LC), progression-free survival (PFS), and overall survival (OS) were calculated using the Kaplan-Meier method. Result(s): The median follow-up period was 47 months (range, 6-90 months). The median radiation dose was 30 Gy (range, 30-30.6 Gy in 15- 17 fractions). All patients were treated by radiation alone, but oral steroid was used for four patients who had double vision at the beginning of treatment. Thirty-four patients were treated with 6 MV photon beams with a wedged pair of fields. Nineteen patients with a lesion confined to the conjunctive or eyelid were treated with 9 MeV electron beams with a single anterior field. In the remaining two patients, combination of the two beams was used. A lead lens block was used in 16 patients. Six patients had bilateral lesions and were treated simultaneously. The 5-year LC rate was 100%. In two patients, local recurrence was suspected at 44 and 46 months, respectively, after radiation therapy, but both of them were diagnosed to have IgG4-related inflammation by biopsy, with no evidence of malignancy upon histological and immunohistochemical examinations. The 5-year PFS and OS rates were 89% and 100%, respectively. Four patients had recurrence at a distant site. The median time to recurrence was 24 months. Three of the four patients received systemic chemotherapy with R-CHOP and another patient is being followed up without second line treatment. One patient developed retinal detachment incidentally during radiation therapy and underwent surgery thereafter. There was no other Grade 3 or higher acute morbidity. Eleven patients had Grade 2 late morbidity (dry eye, 2; cataract, 9). Sixteen patients had Grade 3 cataract. No patients had severe late adverse events other than cataract.

1853,"Additional myeloablation with 52Fe before bone marrow transplantation. For many hematological malignancies, high-dose chemoradiotherapy followed by bone marrow transplantation offers the best and sometimes the only chance for cure. However, the main causes of failure of this therapy are relapse and toxicity. In order to selectively deliver higher doses of radiotherapy to the bone marrow and to spare normal organs, we explored 52Fe therapy before a conventional BMT conditioning regimen. Twenty-four patients at high risk for relapse after BMT were included in a phase II study. The median follow-up was 42 months. The median 52Fe dose was 59 mCi. This resulted in a median radiation-absorbed dose (RAD) to the BM of 626 rad. The median RAD to the liver was 338 rad. No untoward effects were noted after the injections of 52Fe. The patients recovered hematopoiesis without toxicity in excess of that expected with conventional conditioning alone. The 3-year DFS probability was 49% (95% CI: 20-78%), Eight patients have relapsed,three of them in extramedullary sites. 52Fe should provide a way to boost the radiation dose to marrow-based diseases before bone marrow transplantation without excessive toxicity.",Excluded

Purpose: To concurrently quantify the radiation-induced changes and temporal evolutions of parotid volume and parotid apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) in nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) patients treated by intensity-modulated radiotherapy by using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Material(s) and Method(s): A total of 11 NPC patients (9 men and 2 women; 48.7 +/- 11.7 years, 22 parotid glands) were enrolled. Radiation dose, parotid sparing volume, severity of xerostomia, and radiation-to-MR interval (RMI) was recorded. MRI studies were acquired four times, including one before and three after radiotherapy. The parotid volume and the parotid ADC were measured. Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS and MedCalc. Bonferroni correction was applied for multiple comparisons. A P value less than 0.05 was considered as statistically significant. Result(s): The parotid volume was 26.2 +/- 8.0 cm3before radiotherapy. The parotid ADC was 0.8 +/- 0.15 x 10-3mm2/sec before radiotherapy. The parotid glands received a radiation dose of 28.7 +/- 4.1 Gy and a PSV of 44.1 +/- 12.6%. The parotid volume was significantly smaller at MR stage 1 and stage 2 as compared to pre-RT stage (P <.005). The volume reduction ratio was 31.2 +/- 13.0%, 26.1 +/- 13.5%, and 17.1 +/- 16.6% at stage 1, 2, and 3, respectively. The parotid ADC was significantly higher at all post-RT stages as compared to pre-RT stage reciprocally (P <.005 at stage 1 and 2, P <.05 at stage 3). The ADC increase ratio was 35.7 +/- 17.4%, 27.0 +/- 12.8%, and 20.2 +/- 16.6% at stage 1, 2, and 3, respectively. The parotid ADC was negatively correlated to the parotid volume (R = -0.509; P <.001). The parotid ADC was positively associated with the radiation dose significantly (R2 = 0.212; P =.0001) and was negatively associated with RMI significantly (R2 = 0.203; P =.00096) significantly. Multiple regression analysis further showed that the post-RT parotid ADC was related to the radiation dose and RMI significantly (R2 = 0.3580; P <.0001). At MR stage 3, the parotid volume was negatively associated with the dry mouth grade significantly (R2 = 0.473; P <.0001), while the parotid ADC was positively associated with the dry mouth grade significantly (R2 = 0.288; P =.015). Conclusion(s): Our pilot study successfully demonstrates the concurrent changes and temporal evolution of parotid volume and parotid ADC quantitatively in NPC patients treated by IMRT. Our results suggest that the reduction of parotid volume and increase of parotid ADC are dominated by the effect of acinar loss rather than edema at early to intermediate phases and the following recovery of parotid volume and ADC toward the baseline values might reflect the acinar regeneration of parotid glands.

OBJECTIVE: The objective of our study was to investigate the vascular enhancement and image quality of CT venography (CTV) with a lower peak kilovoltage (kVp) setting than the standard setting., MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this retrospective study, the clinical records of 100 consecutive patients with suspected pulmonary embolism were analyzed. All patients underwent pulmonary CT angiography and CTV of the abdomen, pelvis, and lower extremities using 64-MDCT with automatic tube current modulation: 50 patients underwent CT at 120 kVp, the standard kVp setting, and 50 patients were scanned at 100 kVp; we refer to these groups as the ""standard-kVp group"" and the ""low-kVp group,"" respectively. Vessel enhancement and image noise were assessed in the inferior vena cava (IVC), femoral vein, and popliteal vein. Two radiologists who were blinded to the kVp setting placed the regions of interest on vessels by consensus and assessed image quality using a 5-point visual scale. Effective dose was estimated using the dose-length product. The Wilcoxon rank test was used to evaluate differences between the two groups using statistics software (JMP, version 5.1). A p value of less than 0.05 was considered to indicate statistical significance., RESULTS: Mean vascular enhancement was significantly higher in the low-kVp group than in the standard-kVp group: IVC, 138.4 +/- 12.2 (SD) HU versus 164.5 +/- 17.4 HU, respectively; femoral vein, 130.2 +/- 18.0 HU versus 152.0 +/- 24.5 HU; and popliteal vein, 136.7 +/- 17.5 HU versus 158.3 +/- 26.0 HU. Although the images of the low-kVp group had significantly higher image noise, there were no significant differences in image quality in the IVC and popliteal vein.

Background: Concurrent chemo-radiation (CT-RT) is a standard therapy for squamous cell carcinoma of anal canal. Different clinical and biological factors may potentially affect outcome. We investigated the prognostic role of baseline hemoglobin (Hb) in a cohort of anal cancer patients submitted to CT-RT with 5-fluorouracil and mitomycin C. Method(s): Up to 161 patients with clinical stage T1-T4/N0-N3/M0 were treated. Response was assessed at 6 weeks and thereafter at 3, 6 and 12 months. Two different approaches were used:a)simultaneous integrated boost following RTOG 05-29 indications;b)first sequence of 45Gy/25 fractions to the pelvis followed by 9-14.4 Gy/5-8 fractions to the macroscopic disease. Primary endpoints were progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS). Result(s): On multivariate analysis, pre-treatment Hb level had a significant correlation to OS (HR:0.53;95% CI:0.33-0.87; p = 0.001), but not to PFS (HR:0.78;95% CI:0.53-1.15; p = 0.12) Patients with pre-treatment Hb >= 12 g/dl had 5-year PFS and OS of 82.2%, compared to 29.3% and 32.8% for those below the threshold. The likelihood to achieve a complete remission increased by 5.6% for every single-unit (g/dl) increase in baseline Hb level over 11 g/dl. On multivariate analysis, response to treatment had a significant correlation to PFS (incomplete vs complete response - HR:5.43;95% CI:2.75-10.7; p < 0.0001) and OS (HR: 6.96;95% CI:2.96-16.5; p < 0.0001). Conclusion(s): We showed that baseline Hb level is a strong indicator for poor response to RT-CT in anal cancer patients. A close clinical monitoring for incomplete response to treatment should be advised in patients with low pre-treatment Hb. The hypothesis that the preservation of adequate Hb level during treatment may lead to a better outcome needs prospective evaluation.Copyright © 2018 The Author(s).",Excluded
3700,"Allograft alone versus allograft with bone marrow concentrate for the healing of the instrumented posterolateral lumbar fusion. Background context Spondylodesis in the operative management of lumbar spine diseases has been the subject of numerous studies over several decades. The posterolateral fusion (PLF) with pedicle screw fixation is a commonly used procedure. Purpose To determine whether the addition of bone marrow concentrate (BMC) to allograft bone increases fusion rate after instrumented posterior lumbar fusion. Study design The study was prospective, randomized, controlled, and blinded. Methods Eighty patients with degenerative disease of the lumbar spine underwent instrumented lumbar or lumbosacral PLF (22 men, 58 women; body mass index less than 35 for a good visualization of the PLF in the X-rays). In 40 cases, the PLF was done with spongious allograft chips alone (Group I, age 62.7 years in average, range 47-77 years, level of fusion 1-2). In another 40 cases, spongious allograft chips were mixed with BMC (Group II, age 58.5 years in average, range 42-80, level of fusion 1-3), including the mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs). Patients were scheduled for anteroposterior and lateral radiographs 12 and 24 months after the surgery and for computed tomography scanning 24 months after the surgery. Fusion status and the degree of mineralization of the fusion mass were evaluated separately by two radiologists blinded to patient group affiliation. The bony mass was judged as fused if there was uninterrupted bridging of well-mineralized bone between the transverse processes or sacrum, with trabeculation indicating bone maturation on least at one side of the spines. Results In Group I at 12 months, the bone graft mass was assessed in X-rays as fused in no cases (0%) and at 24 months in four cases (10%). In Group II, 6 cases (15%) achieved fusion at 12 months and 14 cases (35%) at 24 months. The statistically significant difference between both groups was proven for complete fusion at both 12 (p=.041) and 24 months (p=.011). Computed tomography scans showed that 16 cases (40%) in Group I and 32 cases (80%) in Group II had evidence of at least unilateral continuous bridging bone between neighboring vertebrae at 24 months (p<.05). Conclusions We have confirmed the hypothesis that the autologous BMC together with the allograft is a better alternative for PLF than the allograft alone. The use of autologous MSCs in form of BMC in combination with allograft is an effective option to enhance the PLF healing. © 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.",Excluded
1728,"Radiation therapy for intrahepatic recurrence after hepatectomy for hepatocellular carcinoma. BACKGROUND: The intrahepatic recurrence rate after curative hepatectomy for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is high, and management of recurrence is thus important for long-term survival. The use of radiation therapy has been relatively uncommon in the treatment of recurrent HCC., METHODS: Eight patients underwent radiation therapy for recurrent HCC 12-98 months after hepatectomy. Five of them were treated with protons (250 MeV; 68.8-84.5 Gy), and three were treated with X-rays (6 MV; 60 or 70 Gy). One patient received radiation therapy twice for another lesion with a 79-month interval. The target tumors were 1.2-4.5 cm. All patients also underwent transcatheter arterial embolization or other regional therapy., RESULTS: Although transient ascites was found in three patients after radiation therapy, no patient died as a result of the irradiation. Seven patients died 9 months to 4 years (median 1 year 6 months) after radiation therapy. Re-recurrence was observed in the irradiated liver in two patients (local control 78%). Four patients died of lung metastasis after radiation therapy. The median survival time was 3 years 3 months (range 1 year 1 month to 8 years 6 months) after recurrence., CONCLUSION: Multimodality therapy is necessary for the management of recurrence. Radiation therapy could be beneficial when other therapies present some difficulty regarding application or are performed incompletely. It must be emphasized that radiation therapy should be considered in addition to other regional therapies for the treatment of recurrent or re-recurrent HCC, and that radiation therapy can be repeated in selected patients.",Excluded
1786,"Biochemical and hematologic values for 18 clinically healthy radiated tortoises (Geochelone radiata) on St Catherines Island, Georgia. BACKGROUND: The radiated tortoise (Geochelone radiata) is a critically endangered species in its native land, the southern portion of the island of Madagascar. Captive breeding programs have generated data on the breeding behavior and ecology of G radiata; however, hematologic and biochemical data also are critically important in managing populations. OBJECTIVE(S): The purpose of this study was to evaluate sex and seasonal effects on hematologic and biochemical data from captive radiated tortoises. METHOD(S): Whole blood was collected in January and August 2001 from 18 radiated tortoises (10 male, 8 female) housed at the Wildlife Survival Center on St Catherines Island, Georgia, as part of a routine health assessment. Routine hematologic and plasma biochemical analyses and electrophoresis were done using standard methods. Data from male and female tortoises were compared within and between seasons using 2-way ANOVA. RESULT(S): RBC and HCT values were significantly higher in summer than in winter and were higher in males than in females. Total protein concentration did not differ significantly between males and females; however, female tortoises had significantly higher concentrations of alpha1- and beta-globulins in winter and summer compared to males. Male tortoises had significantly higher sodium and uric acid concentrations and LDH activity during winter, and higher urea concentration and LDH and CK activities in summer, compared with females. Female tortoises had significantly higher triglyceride and phosphorus concentrations in winter, and higher phosphorus, cholesterol, and triglyceride concentrations in summer, compared with males. CONCLUSION(S): Sex and seasonal differences in hematologic and biochemical values for radiated tortoises likely reflect vitellogenesis and egg production in females, and altered hydration status and activity in summer. Data from the tortoises in this study will be useful for the seasonal health assessment of this species.",Excluded
877,"Effects of Q-switched Nd:YAG laser irradiation on neural impulse propagation: I. Spinal cord. We studied the effect of irradiation with Q-switched Nd:YAG laser light (1064 nm) on spinal cord dorsal column and dorsolateral white matter in anesthetized rats. To evoke a synchronous sensory input, the sciatic nerve was stimulated electrically and the resulting evoked spinal cord potential (SCP) recorded from the dorsal columns of the ipsilateral side. The waveshape of the SCP showed three components: an early positive peak (P1), representing the responses of the most rapidly conducting fibers, followed by two negative peaks (N1 and N2), which are mainly due to synaptic effects of the volley on dorsal horn cells located in dorsal grey matter. Laser irradiation at 50 mJ/pulse and above resulted in severe reduction in the amplitudes of N1 and N2. In contrast, there was either no reduction at all or only a slight decrease in the amplitude of P1. The selective loss of the synaptic field might be mediated by impairment of synaptic transmission or by loss of high threshold fiber input to dorsal horn neurones. In either event it is likely that the mechanism of the differential effects of laser irradiation on the components of the electrically evoked SCP is at least in part photothermally mediated, since intracord temperatures during laser application greatly exceeded the physiological range.",Excluded
1941,"BCL11b gene is targeted by structural and numerical chromosomal aberrations in mature T-cell lymphoma. Background: BCL11b is a transcriptional repressor required for the differentiation and survival of alpha/beta T lymphocytes and the development of the corticospinal motor neurons in the central nervous system. It is likely involved in cancergenesis either as a tumorsuppressor gene via inactivating mutations or deletions in murine irradiation induced lymphomas or as a transcriptional deregulator via recurrent chromosomal translocation in T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia. In this study we present data on BCL11b gene configuration and protein expression in series of mature T-cell lymphoma. Design(s): 265 mature T-cell lymphoma, namely 119 peripheral T-cell lymphoma, not otherwise specified (PTCL, NOS), 54 angioimmunoblastic T-cell lymphoma, 44 anaplastic large cell lymphoma, 13 extranodal T/NK lymphoma, 2 hepatosplenic T-cell lymphoma, 6 T-cell prolymphocytic leukaemia and 27 mycosis fungoides samples were selected from the files of the Institute of Pathology, Wuerzburg, Germany. All samples were classified according to the WHO classification criteria and studied for presence of genetic aberrations affecting BCL11b gene by newly designed interphase fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) assay in tissue microarray formate. BCL11b protein expression was tested by immunohistochemistry using rat monoclonal antibody 25B6 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc). Result(s): Chromosomal breakpoint in the BCL11b genomic region was detected in 3(1%) out of 265 mature T-cell lymphoma samples. All cases were classified as PTCL, NOS and presented with lymphadenopathy and cutaneous infiltration in 2 male and 1 female adult patients, respectively. One of the samples carried concurrent breakpoint in TCR alpha/sigma, suggesting a presence of an inv(14)(q11;q32), affecting the TCR alpha/sigma and BCL11b loci. Genomic gain in BCL11b/14q32 was recognized in 84 (32%) samples, most frequently affecting PTCL, NOS. Varying level of BCL11b protein expression was observed in 67% of the samples, showing no correlation to the presence or absence of an underlying genetic aberration. Conclusion(s): Our study identified BCL11b gene as a novel recurrent, though infrequent translocation partner in PTCL, NOS, affected also by numerical genetic aberrations. BCL11b protein is commonly expressed in mature T-cell lymphoma however it's biological and clinical significance remains unclear and merit further studies.",Excluded
1119,"Conditional survival among patients with oropharyngeal cancer treated with radiation therapy and alive without recurrence 5 years after diagnosis. Background: Risk of recurrence among patients with oropharyngeal cancer (OPC) who survive 5 years is low. The goal of this study was to assess long-term survival of patients with OPC alive without recurrence 5 years after diagnosis. Method(s): This study included newly diagnosed patients with OPC, who had been treated with radiation and were alive without recurrence 5 years after diagnosis. Overall survival (OS) probabilities beyond 5 years were estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method. Factors associated with OS were determined using Bayesian piecewise exponential survival regression. Standardized mortality ratios for all-cause death were estimated controlling for study year, age, and sex in the US general population. Result(s): Among 1699 patients, the additional 2-year, 5-year, and 10-year OS probabilities were 94%, 83%, and 63%, respectively, and were lower than those in the general population. Patients who were older, were current or former smokers, had other than tonsil or base of tongue tumors, or had T4 tumors had a higher risk of death. Patients who had base of tongue tumors and had received intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) or lower-radiation doses had a lower risk of death. Standardized mortality ratios were higher among current and heavy smokers and lower among recipients of IMRT and lower radiation doses. Conclusion(s): In this large cohort, long-term survival among patients with OPC was good but lower than predicted for the general population. Patients treated with IMRT and those with less tobacco exposure had better outcomes.Copyright © 2020 American Cancer Society",Excluded
3687,"Core decompression combined with implantation of a demineralised bone matrix for non-traumatic osteonecrosis of the femoral head. Introduction: Core decompression is the standard surgical procedure in the treatment of early stage non-traumatic osteonecrosis of the femoral head (ONFH). However, there is still a debate whether decompression in combination with supplementary augmentation by bone grafts, growth factors, or cell implementation is superior to conventional decompression alone. This study evaluated patients after core decompression combined with an augmentation by a demineralised bone matrix, and particularly aimed to report long-term conversion rates to total hip replacement (THR). Material(s) and Method(s): 14 patients with 18 hips suVering from ONFH (Ficat stage I-IIB) underwent this surgical procedure. All patients underwent radiographic and MRI investigations at baseline and at follow-up periods of 12 and 24 months. The clinical follow-up was done using the Merle d'Aubigne-score for an average period of 9 years after surgery. Result(s): 14 of the 18 subjects (77 %) achieved at least a good clinical result after 2 years. The Merle d'Aubignescore improved signiWcantly after 12 (p = 0.0001) and 24 months (p = 0.0002). However, the MRI volumetric analysis showed an increased necrotic bone volume from 3.16 +/- 0.54 to 3.88 +/- 0.62 cm3 (p = 0.04). Within 9 years, 13 out of 18 cases (72 %) required further surgery by THR. Only 7 out of 18 subjects (39 %) reported an ongoing postoperative clinical beneWt, and would retrospectively redo the same surgical approach again. The Wve patients that did not require THR were still satisWed after 9 years. Conclusion(s): In patients with early- stage femoral head osteonecrosis core decompression combined with the implantation of a demineralised bone matrix leads to a limited, temporary pain relief as seen in core decompression alone. However, long-term results were not encouraging with a high rate of conversion to arthroplasty. Therefore, core decompression with implantation of a demineralised bone matrix may be not appropriate to avoid THR in the long term. © Springer-Verlag 2012.",Excluded
2557,"Long-term results of concurrent chemoradiotherapy for T3/T4 locally advanced nasopharyngeal carcinoma. Nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) is one of the most commonly diagnosed head and neck malignancies. This study investigated the outcome of locally advanced NPC patients on concurrent intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) and chemotherapy with docetaxel, cisplatin and 5-fluorouracil (TPF). A total of 226 patients with locally advanced NPC received IMRT, with a total dose of 65-70 Gy and concurrent chemotherapy, with 2 cycles of TPF administered during radiotherapy, between March, 2005 and March, 2007. An additional 2 to 4 cycles of chemotherapy were administered every 21 days following radiotherapy. With a median follow-up time of 35 months (range, 7-60), the 5-year overall survival (OS) rate was 81.4%, with 93.6 and 75.0% for T3 and T4 lesions, respectively, (P=0.001). The 5-year progression-free survival (PFS) was 50.4%, with 66.7 and 46.9% for T3 and T4 lesions, respectively (P<0.001). T-classification was a significant prognostic factor for PFS and OS. The subgroup analysis revealed that pterygopalatine fossa invasion was associated with a significantly lower 5-year PFS (P=0.001) and OS (P=0.002), foramen rotundum invasion was associated with a significantly lower 5-year PFS (P<0.001) and OS (P=0.004), foramen ovale invasion was associated with a significantly lower 5-year PFS (P=0.013) and OS (P=0.024) and foramen lacerum and cavernous sinus invasion were associated with a significantly lower 5-year PFS (P<0.001 and P<0.001, respectively). Concurrent chemoradiotherapy is an advocated regimen for patients with locally advanced NPC, since it exhibits satisfactory 5-year PFS and OS rates. Our results suggest that the estimation of invasive range may identify a subgroup of patients with a higher risk of locoregional failure who may be better candidates for this treatment strategy.",Excluded
3203,"Octreotide acetate enables the administration of chemoradiotherapy, including the oral anticancer drug S-1, in gastric cancer patients with malignant gastrointestinal obstruction. Advanced gastric cancer frequently RESULTS in the inability to ingest food or drink orally, a condition called malignant gastrointestinal obstruction (MGO). MGO is clinically defned as a gastrointestinal outlet obstruction caused by a large tumor, or malignant bowel obstruction with peritoneal dissemination. MGO impacts the quality of life by interfering with oral intake and by causing gastrointestinal symptoms, such as nausea, vomiting and abdominal pain. Octreotide acetate (OA) is an analogue of somatostatin which has been increasingly used to relieve gastrointestinal symptoms since it decreases the secretion of digestive juices and increases the absorption of water and electrolytes. In Japan, the oral anticancer drug S-1 was recently adopted as a key chemotherapeutic agent in advanced gastric cancer; however, its oral formulation precludes its utility in the MGO setting. This is a pilot study of chemoradiotherapy plus OA in gastric cancer with MGO. Patients were initially treated with OA to control gastrointestinal symptoms. Following resolution of their symptoms, the patients received chemotherapy with S-1 plus low-dose cisplatin and radiation. Irradiation was targeted at the primary tumor and surrounding lesions, including the lymph nodes. Grade 4 toxicity was observed in only 1 patient, and no treatment-related deaths were noted. After treatment, 3 patients achieved a partial response and 4 achieved stable disease. Of the 9 patients, 8 were able to tolerate solid food orally and were discharged. The outcomes of these cases suggest that OA is a useful adjunctive therapy that enables advanced gastric cancer patients with MGO to receive S-1-containing chemotherapy.",Excluded
1587,"A comparison of leg length discrepancy with function and satisfaction scores after cemented total hip replacement. Introduction: Total Hip replacement (THR) is considered an effective surgical intervention for the relief of chronic pain and functional disability. However, a proportion of patients experience a poor outcome. Leg length discrepancy (LLD) can be introduced, or not corrected, at the time of operation. Previous research has shown that patients with LLD reported a lower functional outcome than those with equal leg lengths. We report on a cohort of 146 patients with a minimum of 3-year follow-up who underwent cemented total hip replacement. We have compared the data when looking at independent variables including age, sex, BMI, femoral head size, offset of stem, grade of surgeon, surgical approach and cup type. Material(s) and Method(s): 146 patients were followed up for a mean of 3.66 years (range 3.25-4.5 years). There were 96 females and 45 males. The mean age at surgery was 77 years (range 50-95 years). All patients were reviewed in clinic or contacted by postal survey for assessment of function and satisfaction. The pre-operative X-rays were compared with early post-operative X-rays. LLD was assessed radiologically according to the method of Woolson, as modified by Konyves and Bannister, on plain sequential AP pelvis radiographs by 2 independent observers. Result(s): Mean LLD was 2 mm (range -10 mm to +14 mm). No significant association was found for the above independent variables. The overall stem alignment was satisfactory. A non-significant reduction in function (measured by oxford hip score, SF- 12 and satisfaction score) was noted in association with LLD of greater than 5 mm. Discussion(s): We report radiological LLD after cemented THR. This has previously been reported as being linked to function. We found a non-significant correlation between reported function and satisfaction with LLD. However 94% of our observed limb lengths were within 1 cm of the other side. There was no significant association between LLD and other independent variables.",Excluded

BACKGROUND: Radiation therapy's (RT's) effects on cardiac implantable electronic devices (CIEDs) such as implantable cardioverter-defibrillators (ICDs) and pacemakers (PMs) are not well established, leading to device removal or relocation in preparation for RT., OBJECTIVE: To determine the effect of scattered RT on CIED performance., METHODS: We analyzed 69 patients--50 (72%) with PMs and 19 (28%) with ICDs--receiving RT at the University of Michigan. Collected data included device model, anatomic location, and treatment beam energies, treatment type, and estimated dose to the device. Patients were treated with either high-energy (16-MV) and/or low-energy (6 MV) photon beams with or without electron beams (6-16 MeV). The devices were interrogated with pre- and post-RT and/or weekly with either in-treatment or home interrogation, depending on the patient's dependence on the device and the estimated or measured delivered dose. Outcomes analyzed were inappropriate ICD therapies, device malfunctions, or device-related clinical events., RESULTS: The PMs were exposed to 84.4 +/- 99.7 cGy of radiation, and the ICDs were exposed to 92.1 +/- 72.6 cGy of radiation. Two patients with ICDs experienced a partial reset of the ICD with the loss of historic diagnostic data after receiving 123 and 4 cGy, respectively. No device malfunction or premature battery depletion was observed at 6-month follow-up from RT completion., CONCLUSIONS: CIED malfunction due to indirect RT exposure is uncommon. Regular in-treatment or home interrogation should be done to detect and treat these events and to ensure that diagnostic data are preserved. Copyright © 2012 Elsevier Inc.

The present study aimed to discuss the method and effect of posterior internal fixation of thoracolumbar fractures strengthened by the vertical stress pedicle screw fixation of fractured vertebrae. Patients with single thoracolumbar fractures were examined retrospectively. Fourteen patients (group A) had been treated with vertical stress pedicle screw fixation of a fractured vertebra and sixteen patients (group B) received traditional double-plate fixation, as a control. All patients were diagnosed with fresh fractures with a complete unilateral or bilateral pedicle and no explosion of the inferior half of the vertebral body or inferior endplate. In group A, patients received conventional posterior distraction and lumbar lordosis restoration, as well as pedicle screws in the fractured vertebra in a vertical direction to relieve stress to achieve a local stress balance. All patients were followed up postoperatively for 4-18 months (average, 12.6 months). The vertical stress pedicle screw fixation assisted in the reduction of vertebrae fracture, which reduced the postoperative Cobb's angle loss. There was a significant difference in the change of Cobb's angle between the two groups one year after surgery (P<0.01). Conditional application of pedicle screws in a single thoracolumbar fracture enhances the stability of the internal fixation system and is conducive to the correction of kyphosis and maintenance of the corrective effects.",Excluded
2007,"Bone and joint modeling from 3D ankle MRI: Feasibility and comparisonwith radiographs and 2D MRI. Purpose: To evaluate feasibility of creating segmented joint models (bone surface reconstructed x-ray) from 3D isotropic ankle MRI, assess various angular and joint space measurements on models and compare with corresponding radiographs and 2D MRI measurements, and determine differences in time consumption for performing the measurements. Material(s) and Method(s): Under HIPPAA compliance, consecutive series of 27 subjects with 3D ankle MRI isotropic data sets (0.65 mm voxel, fast spin echo, proton density weighted sequence) performed on 3 T scanners were used. Three subjects with incomplete x-ray series were excluded. Thus, a total of 24 subjects, 11 left and 13 right ankles, were included in the study, of which 8 were male and 16 females. Age ranged from 17 to 73 with mean of 46 years. Segmented joint models (bone surface reconstructed x-rays) were created on all isotropic MR data sets by one observer. Three readers independently performed various blinded angular and joint space measurements on the models, corresponding 2D MRI, and radiographs (XR) at study inception and 8 weeks later. Means and standard deviations were calculated. Paired t-tests were performed for each pair (XR vs. 2D, XR vs. 3D and 2D vs. 3D) within each parameter. P values less than 0.05 were considered as statistically significant and box plots were generated. Spearman correlation coefficient between measurements was performed to assess Inter-reader agreement. Interclass correlation and time difference analysis was performed. Result(s): 3D segmentation models resembling x-ray were successfully created in all cases within 20 (+/-5) minutes. Good agreement (ICC > 0.65) between all reader measurements was noted across all modalities with the exception of measuring the Talocural angle (3D, 2D, XR), talar pitch (3D), and tibibofibular clear space (2D), which showed weak to poor correlation. Time consumption was significantly greater (p < 0.05) on 2D vs 3D for all measurements except lateral clear space and medial tibiotalar concavity assessments. Time consumption was noted to be significantly greater (p < 0.05) on XR as compared to 3D for nearly half the measurements (5 of 11) for each reader. Conclusion(s): 3D bone and joint segmentation models resembling x-ray are feasible from isotropic ankle MRI data sets, which might lead to possibility of automated measurements by computer in future. While good correlation was noted between all readers, absolute measurement values were significantly different between modalities. The differences in absolute values is likely related to positioning variances (rotated x-ray mortise causing varied joint width, non-angle corrected 2D images, weight bearing vs non weight bearing, and the optimal positioning of reconstructed 3D image). Tighter collimation, a protocol variation, also limited evaluation in some cases by non-inclusion of reference points normally used with XR imaging and contributed to variance. Very good (ICC > 0.7) intrareader agreement was noted for most measurements with a few measurements showing moderate to good correlation (ICC > 0.5 to 0.65), Measurements on the 3D model of joint spaces was significantly faster when compared to 2D and generally faster than XR.",Excluded

Background The aim of this study is to investigate the relationship between bone metabolic disturbances and periodontal diseases Objectives Several studies discuss the relationship between systemic bone mineral density (BMD) and periodontal diseases. Osteoporosis or low systemic BMD should be considered as the risk factor for periodontal disease progression. The purpose of this study was to determine the impact of bone metabolism on the periodontal status in the patients. Methods The study included 89 patients (38 men and 51 women, mean age - 43.5+/-5.1 years) with the healthy periodontal status (HPS) and 231 patients (108 men and 123 women, mean age - 45.6+/-5.2 years) with generalized periodontitis (GP). Clinical conditions of periodontal tissue and radiographic determinations (panoramic X-Ray) were evaluated. Skeletal systemic BMD was measured by DXA. Metabolic processes of bone tissue were evaluated by bone turnover markers: bone tissue formation - osteocalcin (OC), bone-specific alkaline phosphatase (BAP) in serum and bone tissue resorption marker - deoxypiridinoline (DPD) in urine. Results Comparative analysis of structural and functional state of bone tissue in patients showed a mineral density reduction in GP group compared to HPS, but these changes were not statistically significant. Disorders of bone tissue metabolism and dissociation in the processes of bone tissue remodeling were determined in patients with GP. The OC level in the patients with GP (18.89+/-0.87 ng/ml in men and 20.39+/-1.14 ng/ml in women) was statistically significantly (p<0.01) lower compared to the HPS group (24.14+/-1.04 ng/ml in men and 27.56+/-1.12 ng/ml in women).

3164,"Eosinophilic interleukin 5 (IL-5) transgenic mice: eosinophil activity and impaired clearance of Schistosoma mansoni. Eosinophilia is a feature common to many invasive helminth infections and eosinophils are often considered to be effector cells in immunity to helminths. This study examined the possible influence of constitutive eosinophilia on the clearance of Schistosoma mansoni infections in mice. Eosinophils from interleukin-5 transgenic mice exhibit normal ultrastructure and function with regard to phagocytosis and killing of bacteria and responses to chemotactic stimuli. IL-5 transgenics and non-transgenic littermates were immunized once or four (hyperimmunization) times with irradiated cercariae of S. mansoni. Animals were challenged percutaneously with unirradiated cercariae one month after their last exposure to irradiated parasites. One month after challenge transgenic animals, whether unimmunized, vaccinated or hypervaccinated, carried significantly more liver-stage parasites than non-transgenic animals. These results suggest that although eosinophils from IL-5 transgenic mice are functional for a number of key parameters, large numbers of eosinophils and/or high levels of IL-5 may in some way impair clearance of S. mansoni. A re-evaluation of the roles of eosinophils and IL-5 in infections with this and other parasites may therefore be warranted.",Excluded

And we further performed a preliminary study about the effect of Nrf2 on chemoradiation sensitivity. Immunohistochemical staining for Nrf2 in paired clinical specimens showed that TMZ and IR combined treatment increased the expression and nuclear localization of Nrf2 in human glioblastoma tissues. Moreover, we found nuclear Nrf2 expression in the glioblastoma tissues obtained from the patients undergoing TMZ and IR combined treatment was associated with the time to tumor recurrence. In vitro, we further verified these findings. First, we detected increased nuclear localization of Nrf2 following treatment with TMZ+IR in human glioblastoma cell lines. Second, we demonstrated TMZ+IR increased the levels of Nrf2 protein in both nuclear and cytoplasmic fractions of U251 cells and induced Nrf2 target genes expression. Finally, downregulating Nrf2 expression increased TMZ+IR-induced cell death in the U251 cells. These findings suggest TMZ+IR combined treatment induces Nrf2 activation in human glioblastoma cells. The activation of Nrf2 may be associate with enhancing chemoradiation sensitivity in human glioblastoma cell. Blocking Nrf2 activation may be a promising method enhancing chemoradiation sensitivity of glioblastoma cells.",Excluded

A survey of dental assisting programs revealed little standardization of student requirements for dental radiography in the United States. Areas for concern were (1) the high proportion of programs in which classmates exposed one another to ionizing radiation for training purposes and (2) the continued use of closed cones in some cases. Preclinical laboratories in radiography were, on average, of considerably longer duration than those previously reported for dental students. Conversely, clinical requirements in intraoral techniques were less for dental assisting students than is the case for dental students. Available methods of reducing patient exposure to ionizing radiation are not being fully implemented.",Excluded
1789,"Optimal scan parameters for ct fluoroscopy in lung interventional radiologic procedures: Relationship between radiation dose and image quality. Purpose: To evaluate the relationship between radiation doses and lung computed tomographic (CT) fluoroscopic scan parameters and to determine optimal scan parameters for performance of lung interventional radiologic (IR) procedures. Material(s) and Method(s): The institutional review board approved this prospective study, which included 32 patients with a single lung tumor;written informed consent was obtained. CT fluoroscopic images were obtained with three tube voltages (80,120,135 kV) and three tube currents (10, 20, 30 mA) in each patient. The signal-to-noise ratios(SNRs) and the contrast-to-noise ratios (CNRs) were measured quantitatively. To evaluate the feasibility of performing lung IR procedures, four readers visually scored the image quality. Acceptable CT fluoroscopic images were determined by using agreement of at least three of the four readers. The weighted CT dose index for each CT scan parameter was measured. A piecewise linear regression equation was obtained from the relationship between radiation doses and visual image scores. Result(s): Both the SNR and the CNR improved as the radiation dose increased, leading to improvement in the image quality. Acceptable image quality was achieved in 94% (30 of 32) of patients when the radiation dose was 1.18 mGy/sec (120 kV, 10 mA) and in all patients when it was greater than 1.48 mGy/sec (135 kV, 10 mA). The piecewise linear curve showed rapid improvement in image quality until the radiation dose increased to 1.48 mGy/sec (135 kV, 10 mA). When the radiation dose was increased greater than 1.48 mGy/sec, improvement in the image quality became more gradual. Conclusion(s): Results of this study can be used to guide the determination of optimal scan parameters in lung CT fluoroscopy. © RSNA, 2010.",Excluded

759,"Clinico-epidemiological and histopathological parameters of basal cell carcinoma: A single center experience from south india. Background: Basal cell carcinoma (BCC) is the commonest non-melanoma skin cancer among Caucasian and other light-skinned races. A rising trend in the occurrence of BCC has been observed globally. Data on occurrence of BCC in Indian population is lacking. Objective(s): To study the clinico-epidemiological and histopathological parameters of BCC in Indian patients. Material(s) and Method(s): Retrospective data analysis was done from the records of the patients with BCC examined in the dermatology department of a tertiary health care center over 16 years. Result(s): Among 105 premalignant and malignant skin lesions, 40 cases of BCC were recorded. Females were more common sufferers (F: M= 2.33:1). Four patients had genodermatoses (xerodema pigmentosum =3 and nevoid BCC syndrome=1). Most frequent age group was 61-70 years (n=11). Two non-syndromic patients were below 25 years of age. History of chronic sun exposure was present in all, either occupationally or related to daily activities. Four males were chronic alcoholic and 6 were smokers. Face was the commonest site involved (n=35), followed by scalp, post-auricular area and neck. Thirty six patients had single lesion and multiple lesions were present in 4 cases of genodermatoses. Commonest clinical diagnosis was pigmented BCC followed by nodular. Large morpheiform lesion was found in five. Histopathologically, all showed nests of basaloid cells with peripheral pallisading and retraction artifact. Eighteen specimens had melanin deposits; keratotic (2) and metatypical (1) patterns were observed. Chronic inflammatory infiltrate was present in sixteen. Conclusion(s): Exposure to ultraviolet light is the most important factor in the pathogenesis of BCC. Unlike the episodic exposure in temperate climate, sun-exposure is continuous and across the year in most parts of India. However, darker races may develop BCC less frequently and pigmented type is the commonest presentation. Females, though less susceptible to occupational solar exposure in Indian set-up, were more commonly affected.",Excluded
968,"Investigation of the effect of UV irradiation on DNA damage: comparison between skin cancer patients and normal volunteers. BACKGROUND: Susceptibility to environmental carcinogenesis is the consequence of a complex interplay between intrinsic hereditary factors and actual exposure to potential carcinogenic agents. Exposure to sunlight is the primary etiological agent for basal cell carcinoma (BCC)., AIM: The aim of this study was to determine the effects of different ultraviolet (UV) doses on DNA damage in epidermal keratinocytes in vivo and to elucidate if patients with BCC are more susceptible to UV-induced DNA damage in comparison with normal healthy volunteers in response to solar simulator radiation (SSR)., MATERIALS AND METHODS: Skin biopsies obtained post-UV irradiation from both normal healthy volunteers and BCC patients were analyzed for DNA damage, using immunohistochemical approach with TDM-2 antibody, which binds specifically to cyclobutane pyrimidine dimmers (CPDs)., RESULTS: In both normal volunteers and BCC patients, the peak of CPD-positive cells occurred at 4.5 h post-SSR. There was a statistically significant difference in CPD positivity between BCC patients and normal volunteers, at time points (from 4.5 h to 48 h post-SSR). For a given dose of SSR based on each individual minimal erythema dose (MED), a greater number of CPD-positive cells could be shown., CONCLUSIONS: This study has shown for the first time and in vivo in human volunteers that BCC patients are more susceptible to UV-induced DNA damage in comparison with normal healthy volunteers.

3534,"Telomere length in human adults and high level natural background radiation. BACKGROUND: Telomere length is considered as a biomarker of aging, stress, cancer. It has been associated with many chronic diseases such as hypertension and diabetes. Although, telomere shortening due to ionizing radiation has been reported in vitro, no in vivo data is available on natural background radiation and its effect on telomere length. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: The present investigation is an attempt to determine the telomere length among human adults residing in high level natural radiation areas (HLNRA) and the adjacent normal level radiation areas (NLNRA) of Kerala coast in Southwest India. Genomic DNA was isolated from the peripheral blood mononuclear cells of 310 individuals (HLNRA: N = 233 and NLNRA: N = 77). Telomere length was determined using real time q-PCR. Both telomere (T) and single copy gene (S) specific primers were used to calculate the relative T/S and expressed as the relative telomere length. The telomere length was determined to be 1.22+/-0.15, 1.12+/-0.15, 1.08+/-0.08, 1.12+/-0.11, respectively, among the four dose groups (</=1.50, 1.51-3.00, 3.01-5.00 and >5.00 mGy per year), which did not show any dose response. The results suggested that the high level natural chronic radiation did not have significant effect on telomere length among young adult population living in HLNRA, which is indicative of better repair of telomeric ends. No significant difference in telomere length was observed between male and female individuals. In the present investigation, although the determination of telomere length was studied among the adults with an age group between 18 to 40 years (mean maternal age: 26.10+/-4.49), a negative correlation was observed with respect to age. However, inter-individual variation was (0.81-1.68) was clearly observed. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: In this preliminary investigation, we conclude that elevated level of natural background radiation has no significant effect on telomere length among the adult population residing in HLNRAs of Kerala coast. To our knowledge, this is the first report from HLNRAs of the world where telomere length was determined on human adults. However, more samples from each background dose group and samples from older population need to be studied to derive firm conclusions.",Excluded
2846,"Postoperative radiotherapy-induced morbidity in rectal cancer. OBJECTIVES: We analyzed long-term morbidity and bowel function alteration after postoperative radiotherapy for rectal cancer following resection with anastomosis., PATIENTS AND METHODS: Thirty-seven patients who underwent surgery with intention to cure and a minimal follow-up period of 3 years were included. These patients were divided into two groups: in the first group, 14 patients received postoperative chemo-radiotherapy, 5-fluorouracil plus folinic acid, and 45 Gy plus 5 Gy boost. In the second group, there were 23 patients regarded as controls. We designed a questionnaire about their bowel function and analyzed the morbidity detected in their follow-up., RESULTS: The group that was treated with postoperative chemo-radiotherapy had more daily bowel movements (p = 0.03) and night-time movements (p = 0.04); incontinence (69.2 vs. 17.4% in the control group; p = 0.002), and perianal skin irritation (p = 0.04) versus the control group. Although without meaningful differences, the group under treatment wore a pad more often, had more defecatory urgency, could distinguish worse gas from stool, and needed more frequently antidiarrheal measures. Major complications were present in 28.6% of the under-treatment group: three intestinal resections were performed due to actinic stenosis; one patient had a residual stercoral fistula; another had several occlusive crises solved with medical treatment., CONCLUSIONS: Postoperative chemo-radiotherapy had a high morbidity rate, which determined a significant alteration in quality of life.

Objective This study aims to explore the normal reference values for thyroid uptake of technetium-99m (99m Tc) pertechnetate in a UK population. Patients and methods A retrospective review of 60 euthyroid patients who underwent thyroid imaging with 99m Tc pertechnetate between January 2012 to April 2014 as part of dual-tracer subtraction parathyroid scintigraphy. 99m Tc pertechnetate thyroid uptake values were determined for each patient. Medical records and biochemical thyroid function tests were reviewed to ensure that all patients were not on medication that could affect thyroid function and they were both clinically and biochemically euthyroid 6 months before and following the scan. Results Median and interquartile uptake range of 99m Tc pertechnetate in euthyroid patients were 0.9 and 0.5-1.4%, respectively. The normal reference range in the study population was 0.2-2.0%. Thyroid uptake inversely correlated with age in females (r=-0.40, P=0.04), males (r=-0.50, P=0.04), and whole group (r=-0.40, P=0.002). Conclusion The calculated normal reference range in this study was found to be less than that used in our own and many other UK institutions. The results demonstrate the importance of periodic evaluation of normal uptake values and provide support for prospective studies defining the normal reference range to be performed.Copyright © 2018 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

Purpose: This retrospective study was done to better understand the conditions for which stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) for glioblastoma may be efficacious. Method(s): Between 2000 and 2007, 33 patients with a pathological diagnosis of glioblastoma received SRS with the Novalis Shaped Beam Radiosurgery system. Eighteen patients (54%) underwent salvage SRS for recurrence while 15 (45%) patients received upfront SRS following standard fractionated RT for newly diagnosed glioblastoma. Result(s): There were no RTOG grade >2 acute side effects. The median survival after SRS was 6.7 months (range 1.4-74.7). There was no significant difference in overall survival (from the time of initial diagnosis) with respect to the timing of SRS (p = 0.2). There was significantly better progression free survival in patients treated with SRS as consolidation versus at the time of recurrence (p = 0.04). The majority of patients failed within or at the margin of the SRS treatment volume (21/26 evaluable for recurrence). Conclusion(s): SRS is well tolerated in the treatment of glioblastoma. As there was no difference in survival whether SRS is delivered upfront or at recurrence, the treatment for each patient should be individualized. Future studies are needed to identify patients most likely to respond to SRS. © 2009 Biswas et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",Excluded

Context Pancreas cancer can potentially be cured by resection, but the role of adjuvant chemotherapy and/or chemoradiation has been controversial. Objectives To better define clinicopathological factors that may serve as predictive and/or prognostic variables. Patients Between 1984 and 2006, we retrospectively analyzed 91 patients with pancreas cancer treated with pancreaticoduodenectomy or total pancreatectomy followed by adjuvant 5-fluorouracil-based chemoradiation at the University of Pennsylvania. Final pathological coding including margin status was confirmed by a pathologist. Interventions Patients were treated with 48.6 to 63.0 Gy, and 96.7% completed their prescribed radiation dose. Main outcome measures The prognostic significance of demographic factors, stage, year of surgery, tumor location, grade, resection status, and number of positive lymph nodes on overall survival were examined. Results With a median follow-up of 6.5 years, the overall median survival was 2.3 years (95% CI 1.5-3.2 years), and the 5-year overall survival was 28.9%. In multivariate analysis, completeness of resection (P<0.001), fewer number of positive lymph nodes (0 vs. 1-2 vs. 3 or more) (P=0.004), and age less than, or equal to, 60 years (P=0.006) were all independently associated with improved overall survival. The overall survival reported in this study compares favorably with the results of other single-institution studies and with the RTOG 97-04 trial. Conclusions Adjuvant 5-FU-based chemoradiation following radical pancreatectomy can be delivered safely and results in comparatively good overall survival. The results of this analysis underscore the importance of resection status, number of involved lymph nodes and patient age as prognostic characteristics. These factors may be considered stratification variables for future post-pancreatectomy adjuvant therapy trials.",Excluded
3354,"Clinical and molecular recursive partitioning analysis of high-grade glioma treated with IMRT. Introduction: Despite multimodal treatment for high-grade gliomas, prognosis remains grim. Prior Radiation Therapy Oncology Group-Recursive Partitioning Analysis (RTOG-RPA) reports indicate based on pretreatment and treatment-related factors, a subset of patients experience a significantly improved survival. Since the development of the RTOG-RPA, high-grade gliomas have seen the widespread introduction of temozolomide and tumor oncogenetics. Here we aimed to determine whether the RTOG-RPA retained prognostic significance in the context of modern treatment, as well as generate an updated RPA incorporating both clinical and genetic variables. Method(s): Patients with histologically proven glioblastoma, gliosarcoma, anaplastic astrocytoma, and anaplastic oligodendroglioma treated with intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) between 2004 and 2017 were reviewed. The primary endpoint was overall survival from date of diagnosis. Primary analysis compared actual survival rates to that expected of corresponding RTOG-RPA class. Secondary analysis utilized the rpart function to recursively partition overall survival by numerous clinical and genetic pretreatment and treatment-related variables. A tertiary analysis recursively partitioned a subset of patients in which the status of all genetic markers were known. Result(s): We identified 878 patients with histologically proven high-grade glioma treated with IMRT and 291 patients in our genetic subset. Median overall survival for the entire cohort was 14.2 months (95% confidence interval, 13.1-15.3). Applying the RTOG-RPA to our cohort validated the relative prognostic ordering of the survival classes except class II. Generating our new RPA created 7 significantly different survival classes (P<0.001, chi 2 =584) with median survival ranging from 96.4 to 2.9 months based on age, histology, O6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase methylation status, radiation fractions, tumor location, radiation dose, temozolomide status, and resection status. Our second RPA of our genetic subset generated 5 significantly different survival classes (P<0.001, chi 2 =166) with survival ranging from 65.3 to 5.6 months based on age, isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 mutation status, O6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase methylation status, neurological functional classification, hospitalization during IMRT, temozolomide status, and Karnofsky performance status. Conclusion(s): The RTOG-RPA retains partial prognostic significance, however, should be updated to reflect recent advancements. This series represents a large RPA analyzing both clinical and genetic factors and generated 7 distinct survival classes. Further assessment of patients with fully available genetic markers generated 5 distinct survival classes. These survival classifications need to be validated by a prospective data set and compared against the RTOG-RPA to determine whether they provide improved prognostic power.© Copyright 2018 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

In 52 patients undergoing tests of cell-mediated immunity before surgical resection of bronchial carcinoma a positive tuberculin test result was found in 71% compared with 68% of age- and sex-matched controls. Sensitisation to DNCB occurred in 52% of 37 patients but in 78% of controls. There was depression of lymphocyte transformation by PPD in 19 patients compared with controls (P=0.001), but there was no difference in lymphocyte transformation by PHA or pokeweed mitogen between 34 patients and controls. In a pilot study patients were randomly allocated to autograft (eight) or non-autograft (seven) groups. The autograft group were given an intradermal injection of a suspension of irradiated autologous tumour-cells mixed with intradermal BCG on the day of operation. Tests of cell-mediated immunity were repeated two weeks after operation. Five patients in each group received a course of radiotherapy to the mediastinum three weeks after operation. There was a rise in cutaneous tuberculin reactivity (P=0.08) and total leucocyte count (P=0.09) in the autograft group postoperatively with a fall in total lymphocyte and T lymphocyte counts in the non-autograft group (P less 0.05). These differences, however, were not followed by any difference in the frequency of tumour recurrence or the survival rate two years after operation. The results show that the immunological surveillance mechanism is impaired even in patients with early bronchial carcinoma and that it is possible to overcome postoperative immunological depression with specific immunotherapy combined with BCG.

792,"The role of age, sex and steroid sex hormones in radiation cataractogenesis. It is critical to identify and gain a better understanding of the factors that enhance or reduce the risk of cataractogenesis, to minimize the possibility of occurrence after deliberate (e.g., radiation therapy, interplanetary travel) or unintentional exposure to ionizing radiation. Both gender and age at the time of exposure have been established as key determinants of cataractogenesis induced by sparsely ionizing (low-LET) and densely ionizing (high-LET) radiation. However, animal data from several older studies are often conflicting and somewhat difficult to interpret, in that the experiments suffered from small group sizes, limited dose ranges or short periods of observation, and human data are sparse or statistical significance is sometimes limited. Steroid sex hormones (SSH) may underlie age and gender-based differences in the progression and prevalence of cataracts that otherwise occur spontaneously in humans and animal models, and may also underlie age and sex-related differences in radiation cataractogenesis. Here, we review data that have aided in our understanding of the role of age, sex and steroid sex hormones in radiation cataractogenesis. © 2013 by Radiation Research Society.",Excluded

Purpose: Our aim was to evaluate the acute success and complication rates of the transradial and transulnar access for iliac artery stenting using sheathless guiding systems. Method(s): Clinical and angiographic data from 156 consecutive patients with symptomatic iliac artery stenosis who were treated with transradial or transulnar access were evaluated. All patients underwent Duplex ultrasound before and after the intervention. The primary endpoints were the procedural success rate, major adverse events, and access site complication rates. The secondary endpoints were the angiographic result of the iliac artery intervention, fluoroscopy time, X-ray dose, procedure length, crossover rate to another puncture site and hospitalization duration. The impact of the learning curve was also investigated, along with right or left radial access. Result(s): The indication for the intervention was intermittent claudication in 109 patients (69.9%), critical limb ischemia in 44 (28.2%) subjects and acute limb ischemia in three individuals (1.9%). Technical success was achieved in 155 patients (99.4%), with a crossover rate of 3.8%. Radial and ulnar artery access was used in 151 (96.8%) and 7 (4.5%) patients, respectively. The Ankle-brachial index increased from 0.69 [0.65-0.72] to 0.91 [0.88-0.95] as a result of the procedures (P < 0.001). The cumulative incidence of major adverse events was 3.8% at the 2-month follow-up (0% in patients with intermittent claudication and 13.8% in patients with critical limb ischemia). Radial artery access site complications were encountered in eight patients (5.1%). We documented decreased X-ray doses (1742.0 [783.9-2701] vs. 1435 [991.1-1879] vs. 692.8 [275.3-1110] Gy cm-2 P < 0.05) over time; however, the fluoroscopy time, procedure time, and contrast consumption were not significantly different. Left hand access was not associated with significantly better results than right radial artery access. Conclusion(s): Iliac artery stenting can be safely and effectively performed using radial or ulnar artery access and sheathless guiding catheters, with acceptable complication rates and high levels of technical success. The physician learning curve plays an important role in decreasing the X-ray dose. © 2016 The Authors.

554,"Male breast cancer: risk factors, diagnosis, and management (Review). Male breast cancer (MBC) is extremely rare, with an incidence in the general US population of <1%. It tends to be diagnosed at later stages than breast cancer in females, likely because of low awareness on the part of the patient and low suspicion by the physician. Risk factors include genetic predisposition, alterations to the estrogen-testosterone ratio, radiation exposure, and occupational hazards. Because of the rarity of MBC, mammography in men is more often utilized as a diagnostic tool to evaluate breast symptoms rather than as a tool for widespread screening. While clinical breast examinations are effective at evaluating breast symptoms, mammography also may be beneficial in separating malignant from benign breast disease. This study reviews MBC and its risk factors, recommendations for screening and diagnosis, the roles of mammography and genetic testing in surveillance, and management of patients with MBC. Heightened awareness of the increased risk in certain men by both physicians and patients, and adherence to guidelines recommended for the surveillance of men at increased risk, may result in earlier detection.",Excluded

OBJECTIVE: An iterative reconstruction method in combination with resolution recovery, attenuation and scatter corrections (IR-RASC) can improve image quality. It, however, is undetermined whether this technique can improve the detection of coronary artery disease (CAD) when automated quantitative analysis is used. This study evaluated diagnostic values of IR-RASC in combination with automated quantitative analysis in stress myocardial perfusion imaging (MPI) in the CAD detection., METHODS: This study enrolled consecutive 64 patients (mean age 66.2 +/- 17.3 years, 39 males) who had undergone both 99mTc-labeled tetrofosmin stress MPI and coronary angiography within 3 months. Stress MPI abnormalities quantified as summed stress score (SSS), summed rest score (SRS) and summed difference score (SDS) by Heart Risk View-S (HRV-S) and Quantitative Perfusion SPECT (QPS) softwares using IR-RASC images were compared with those by using conventional filtered back-projection method (FBP) images and angiographic findings., RESULTS: Based on expert visual assessment, SSS and SRS by HRV-S/QPS softwares with IR-RASC were significantly lower than those by HRV-S/QPS softwares with FBP at mid- and basal left ventricular segments. Receiver-operating characteristics analysis showed that areas under the curve assessed by HRV-S (0.687) and QPS (0.678) with IR-RASC were nearly identical to those (0.717-0.724) by expert assessment with FBP, and were significantly (P < 0.05) greater than those by HRV-S (0.505) and QPS (0.522) with FBP. When HRV-S was used, the specificity and diagnostic accuracy of IR-RASC in the CAD detection were significantly greater than those of FBP: 90.3 versus 51.6%, P < 0.0001 and 79.7 versus 54.7%, P = 0.0027, respectively. Likewise, when QPS was used, the specificity and diagnostic accuracy of IR-RASC in the CAD detection were significantly greater than those of FBP: 80.6 versus 41.9%, P < 0.0001, and 78.1 versus 51.6%, P = 0.0018, respectively. There, however, were no significant differences in sensitivity between IR-RASC and FBP images., CONCLUSIONS: IR-RASC can improve diagnostic accuracy of the CAD detection using an automated scoring system compared to FBP, by reducing false positivity due to artefactual appearance.",Excluded

PURPOSE: To evaluate the neuroprotective effects of Dl-3-n-butylphthalide (NBP) on patients with radiation-induced brain injury, a hospital-based, clinical retrospective cohort study was conducted., PATIENTS AND METHODS: Data were collected on patients diagnosed with radiation-induced brain injury from January 2009 to January 2015 in Department of Neurology, Sun Yat-Sen Memorial Hospital. All patients enrolled have received cranial radiotherapy and were diagnosed with radiation-induced brain injury. Patients fulfilling certain eligibility criteria were recruited for analysis. The clinical therapeutic effects were observed and evaluated by LENT/SOMA scores before and one month after treatment in these two groups, respectively., RESULTS: The therapeutic effects of headache (total efficiency 75.76%), eurologic deficit (total efficiency 81.58%), cognitive functions (total efficiency 77.78%) and MRI results (total efficiency 74.29%) were better in the experimental group than those in the control group (p < 0.05). Nevertheless, there was no significant difference in mood and personality changes between these two groups., CONCLUSIONS: Administration of Dl-3-n-butylphthalide, in adjunct to corticosteroid therapy, might provide a better outcome in patients with radiation-induced brain injury.",Excluded
2280,"Determination of crystallinity and crystal structure of Hylamer polyethylene after in vivo wear. Hylamer polyethylene is a crystalline form of polyethylene of 70% crystallinity whereas conventional polyethylene (PE) has 50% crystallinity. Crystallinity is the percentage by weight of the crystalline phase present in the whole polymer, which comprises both amorphous and crystalline phases.Clinical experience has shown that Hylamer components used in joint prostheses, if sterilized by gamma rays in the presence of oxygen, are easily affected by wear, which leads to osteolysis. The authors have analyzed the crystallinity of polyethylene liners removed from seven patients who had received Hylamer polyethylene implants sterilized by gamma rays in air and had suffered prosthetic loosening, using Raman spectroscopy coupled with partial least squares (PLS) analysis. The results have been compared to those of two controls who had received Hylamer polyethylene implants sterilized by gamma irradiation in a nitrogen atmosphere. The crystal structure of wear particles released into the tissues from the Hylamer liners sterilized by gamma rays in air is also studied. The materials undergoing two different types of sterilization methods show different crystallinity values (71.50 vs. 69.43), but the crystallinity do not change according to wear (worn and unworn liner region). Both monoclinic and orthorhombic phases are present in the liner, while in wear debris prevalently monoclinic crystals are found in both types of sterilized liners. Different crystallinity rates can explain different wear rates observed in vivo.",Excluded
742,"Preliminary study of dose reduction and image quality of adult pelvic low-dose CT scan with adaptive statistical iterative reconstruction. BACKGROUND: Because pelvic computed tomography (CT) is widely used in clinical practice, there are increasing concerns regarding the associated risks of radiation-induced cancer. Therefore, the capability to reduce the CT radiation dose without compromising image quality is desirable., PURPOSE: To assess the radiation dose and image quality of adult pelvic CT using both a routine dose and low radiation dose with filtered back projection (FBP) and adaptive statistical iterative reconstruction (ASIR)., MATERIAL AND METHODS: Forty-five patients underwent both routine-dose CT with FBP reconstruction and low-dose CT with FBP and 50% ASIR blending ratio (ASIR50) reconstruction, respectively. Three different groups of image data were compared for subjective and objective image quality. CT dose index volume (CTDIvol), dose-length product (DLP), and effective dose (ED) were recorded., RESULTS: The resulting CTDIvol, DLP, and ED following low-dose pelvic CT were 10.80 +/- 6.0 mGy, 265.0 +/- 55.0 mGy.Cm, and 3.97 +/- 0.82 mSv, respectively. When compared with the values obtained following routine-dose pelvic CT, the low-dose pelvic CT values decreased by 62%, 55%, and 56%, respectively (P < 0.001). The results following evaluation of subjective and objective image quality revealed that there was no significant difference (P > 0.05) between routine-dose CT with FBP, and low-dose CT with ASIR50. However, significant differences were detected between low-dose CT with FBP, routine-dose CT with FBP, and low-dose CT with ASIR50 (P < 0.01)., CONCLUSION: The application of low-dose pelvic CT with ASIR50 could dramatically reduce the radiation dose and substantially improve image quality.

417,"Integration of functional MRI and white matter tractography in stereotactic radiosurgery clinical practice. PURPOSE: To study the efficacy of the integration of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and diffusion tensor imaging tractography data into stereotactic radiosurgery clinical practice., METHODS AND MATERIALS: fMRI and tractography data sets were acquired and fused with corresponding anatomical MR and computed tomography images of patients with arteriovenous malformation (AVM), astrocytoma, brain metastasis, or hemangioma and referred for stereotactic radiosurgery. The acquired data sets were imported into a CyberKnife stereotactic radiosurgery system and used to delineate the target, organs at risk, and nearby functional structures and fiber tracts. Treatment plans with and without the incorporation of the functional structures and the fiber tracts into the optimization process were developed and compared., RESULTS: The nearby functional structures and fiber tracts could receive doses of >50% of the maximum dose if they were excluded from the planning process. In the AVM case, the doses received by the Broadmann-17 structure and the optic tract were reduced to 700 cGy from 1,400 cGy and to 1,200 cGy from 2,000 cGy, respectively, upon inclusion into the optimization process. In the metastasis case, the motor cortex received 850 cGy instead of 1,400 cGy; and in the hemangioma case, the pyramidal tracts received 780 cGy instead of 990 cGy. In the astrocytoma case, the dose to the motor cortex bordering the lesion was reduced to 1,900 cGy from 2,100 cGy, and therefore, the biologically equivalent dose in three fractions was delivered instead., CONCLUSIONS: Functional structures and fiber tracts could receive high doses if they were not considered during treatment planning. With the aid of fMRI and tractography images, they can be delineated and spared. Copyright (c) 2010 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.",Excluded
3285,"The increased use of computed tomography scanning for diagnosing superficial soft tissue infections: A disturbing trend of increased radiation with no benefit. Background: Soft tissue infections have historically been diagnosed on the basis of clinical signs and symptoms. A trend toward the increased use of computed tomographic (CT) imaging in their evaluation has been noted. Method(s): A retrospective review was performed of soft tissue infection admissions in 2003 and 2004 and in 2009 and 2010. Intracavitary abscesses (eg, intra-abdominal, pelvic) that would not be evident on physical examination were excluded. Demographic and outcome variables, number of CT scans by body region, and total effective radiation dose were recorded. Radiation exposure was stratified into low, moderate, high, and very high categories. Result(s): There was a significant increase in the number of patients receiving <1 CT scan for initial diagnosis, from 36.7% in the early cohort to 50% in the later cohort (P <.001). The mean cumulative effective dose increased from 5.46 to 7.82 mSv (P =.007). Greater proportions of patients fell into the moderate (32.9% vs 24.5%) and high (6.8% vs 10.6%) radiation exposure categories. Conclusion(s): CT scans are increasingly used in the evaluation of soft tissue infections, with resultant increase in radiation exposure. © 2012 Elsevier Inc.",Excluded
3123,"Straylight measurements as an indication for cataract surgery. PURPOSE: To assess adding straylight measurements to the indication for cataract surgery., SETTING: Onze Lieve Vrouwe Hospital, Amsterdam, and Zonnestraal Eye Clinic, Hilversum, The Netherlands., DESIGN: Prospective interventional cohort study., METHODS: Before and after cataract extraction, corrected distance visual acuity (CDVA) and straylight were recorded in all patients. Subjective complaints were documented by the 39-item National Eye Institute Visual Function Questionnaire (NEI VFQ-39) and a straylight questionnaire., RESULTS: The population comprised 217 patients with a mean age of 72 years +/- 9.12 (SD) (range 29 to 90 years). Preoperatively, the mean straylight was 1.55 +/- 0.29 log(s) and the mean CDVA, 0.28 +/- 0.21 logMAR. Visual acuity and straylight showed little correlation (R(2) = 0.08). The mean postoperative improvement in CDVA was 0.26 +/- 0.20 logMAR (range -0.12 to 1.12 logMAR) and in straylight, 0.31 +/- 0.32 log(s) (range -0.50 to 1.27 log[s]). The preoperative breakeven point (50% chance of postoperative improvement) was 0.06 logMAR for CDVA and 1.29 log(s) for straylight. Preoperative and postoperative questionnaires showed straylight had almost the same influence as visual acuity on quality of vision., CONCLUSIONS: Straylight and visual acuity measure different aspects of quality of vision and influenced subjective visual quality almost equally. When straylight was added to preoperative considerations of cataract extraction, postoperative results were more predictable., FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE: The Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences has a proprietary interest in the C-Quant Straylight meter.

2488,"Pantoprazole for the prevention of gastrointestinal bleeding in high-risk patients with acute coronary syndromes. Purpose: The aim of this study is to evaluate the preventive effect of proton pump inhibitors on gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding in patients with acute coronary syndromes (ACS) who are at high risk for GI bleeding. Material(s) and Method(s): We enrolled 665 patients with ACS who had one or more of the following risk factors for GI bleeding: 75 years of age or older, history of peptic ulcer disease, history of GI bleeding, cardiogenic shock, and chronic renal dysfunction (serum creatinine, >2 mg/dL). Patients were randomly assigned to receive 40 mg of pantoprazole or placebo twice daily for 7 days, in addition to standard treatment of ACS. The primary end point was the occurrence of GI bleeding during hospitalization. Result(s): During a median time of hospitalization of 12 days, 12 (3.6%) of 332 patients in the placebo group had an occurrence of GI bleeding, as compared with 4 (1.2%) of the 333 patients in the pantoprazole group (P =.046, Fisher exact test). The log-rank test showed a significant difference between the 2 groups in the time to the occurrence of GI bleeding (P =.015). Major GI bleeding occurred in 5 (1.5%) patients in the placebo group but only in 1 (0.3%) in the pantoprazole group (P =.12). Pneumonia developed in 22 (6.6%) patients in the placebo group and 24 (7.2%) in the pantoprazole group (-2 = 0.077, P =.88). The 30-day mortality was 10.2% (34/332) in the placebo group and 10.5% (35/333) in the pantoprazole group. Conclusion(s): In patients with ACS who are at high risk for GI hemorrhage, prophylactic treatment with pantoprazole could reduce the risk of GI bleeding with no significant effects on the incidence of hospital-acquired pneumonia and 30-day mortality. © 2011 Elsevier Inc.",Excluded
3152,"Salvage stereotactic radiosurgery with adjuvant use of bevacizumab for heavily treated recurrent brain metastases: a preliminary report. It is not uncommon for brain metastasis (BM) treated with stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) to demonstrate radiographic enlargement, with the patient developing neurological deficits attributable to a lesion at the site of SRS. The management of both local recurrence and radiation-induced necrosis (RN) poses a significant therapeutic dilemma, if surgical resection is not feasible, and effective therapies have yet to be established. This preliminary study introduces our initial experience with salvage SRS using adjuvant bevacizumab for this refractory entity. We retrospectively reviewed five patients who had received salvage SRS using adjuvant bevacizumab for recurrent BM complicated by RN. The diagnosis was based on clinical features, serial imaging studies and/or histopathological findings. Patients underwent salvage SRS followed by the first cycle of bevacizumab (7.5-10 mg/kg intravenous). Bevacizumab was repeated every 3-4 weeks until tumor progression or significant toxic events. The number of bevacizumab doses ranged from 2 to 16 (median 4). Follow-up MR imaging demonstrated a clear radiographic response in all lesions. Neurological symptoms improved in three patients and stabilized in two. In two patients, bevacizumab treatment was discontinued due to anemia and gastrointestinal bleeding, respectively. At the time of data analysis, four patients had died and the other was still alive. The causes of death were neurological decline and systemic disease progression in two patients each. Salvage SRS with adjuvant bevacizumab use appeared to provide an adequate radiographic response as well as neurological palliation for selected patients with heavily treated recurrent BM complicated by RN.Copyright © 2015, Springer Science+Business Media New York.",Excluded
1908,"Prognostic value of metabolic tumor volume as measured by fluorine-18-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography/computed tomography in nasopharyngeal carcinoma. Background: The prognostic value of the tumor burden characterized by the metabolic tumor volume (MTV) remains under investigation in nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC). The purpose of this study was to evaluate the prognostic value of the maximum standardized uptake value (SUVmax) and MTV according to metabolic volume threshold as measured by positron emission tomography (PET)/computed tomography (CT), and other clinical factors, in patients with NPC. Method(s): This study was a retrospective chart review. We evaluated the association of SUVmax, MTV2.5, MTV3.0, and other clinical factors with overall survival (OS) using Kaplan-Meier and Cox regression models. (MTV2.5 and MTV3.0 are the volume of hypermetabolic tissue within the regions of gross tumor volumes with a SUV value greater than the threshold values of 2.5 and 3.0, respectively.) Results: Higher MTV2.5 of 31.45 cm3 and MTV3.0 of 23.01 cm3 were associated with an increased risk of death (hazard ratio [HR] = 5.028; p = 0.029), although no significant relationship was found between SUVmax and OS. Interestingly, MTV3.0 was associated with OS in both the differentiated and undifferentiated groups, although MTV2.5 was only associated with OS in the undifferentiated group. Among the clinical parameters, only radiotherapy was associated with longer OS (HR = 12.124; p < 0.001). Conclusion(s): The MTV and radiotherapy could be prognostic values associated with OS. Particularly, MTV2.5 and MTV3.0 might be valuable metabolic parameters for predicting long-term survival in patients with NPC. Furthermore, MTV3.0 may be more useful because it can be applied irrespective of pathologic subtype.Copyright © 2014 ARS-AAOA, LLC.",Excluded

2361,"Mesenchymal stromal cells implantation in combination with platelet lysate product is safe for reconstruction of human long bone nonunion. Objective: Nonunion is defned as a minimum of 9 months since injury without any visible progressive signs of healing for 3 months. Recent literature has shown that the application of mesenchymal stromal cells is safe, in vitro and in vivo, for treating long bone nonunion. The present study was performed to investigate the safety of mesenchymal stromal cell (MSC) implantation in combination with platelet lysate (PL) product for treating human long bone nonunion. Material(s) and Method(s): In this case series clinical trial, orthopedic surgeons visited eighteen patients with long bone nonunion, of whom 7 complied with the eligibility criteria. These patients received mesenchymal stromal cells (20 million cells implanted once into the nonunion site using a?uoroscopic guide) in combination with PL product. For evaluation of the effects of this intervention all the patients were followed up by taking anterior-posterior and lateral X-rays of the affected limb before and 1, 3, 6, and 12 months after the implantation. All side effects (local or systemic, serious or non-serious, related or unrelated) were observed during this time period. Result(s): From a safety perspective the MSC implantation in combination with PL was very well tolerated during the 12 months of the trial. Four patients were healed; based on the control X-ray evidence, bony union had occurred. Conclusion(s): Results from the present study suggest that the implantation of bone marrow-derived MSCs in combination with PL is safe for the treatment of nonunion.

1740,"Cement augmentation method for proximal epiphyseal humeral fracture in osteoporotic elderly patients treated by intramedullary nailing and plates and screws: A 4-year follow-up. Introduction Proximal epiphyseal humeral fractures are common in elderly people and their treatment has a rate of complications due to technical failure (cut out, head rotation). Methods We studied 24 patients (15 females, 9 males) with an average age of 79.42 years (range 69 to 83 years) and severe osteoporotic bone (1 or 2 Singh score). They all had proximal epiphyseal humeral fracture, classified as type II-III following Neer classification, defined as fractures of the surgical humeral neck. Sixteen patients were treated with T2 proximal humeral nail (Stryker Srl) and 8 with Philos plate and screws (Synthes Srl) with a modified technique consisting in augmentation of the proximal screws. Augmentation was done with The Locker system (Tecres SpA) inserted through the tunnel for the cephalic screws. The evaluation is based on: operating time, early functional recovery using the Constant- Murley score, X-ray evaluation, mechanical and biological complications. Results The Constant-Murley average score was 71.3 after 1 month post-operation, 73.4 after 3 months, 76.7 after 12 months, 75.4 after 48 months. No other complications (infection, cut out and humeral head necrosis) have been reported at the follow-up. Discussion The review of the recent literature highlights the augmentation's method benefits in support of fractures due to osteoporosis. Due to the poor quality of the bone tissue, this is not able to provide sufficient substrate in which the means of synthesis can be anchored stably, leading to complications in the subject. Conclusions The observations based on the reported results allow to conclude that the cement augmentation of proximal screws in severe osteoporotic bone treatedwith T2 nail and Philos plate could improve the mechanical stability of the implant, ensuring early functional recovery.",Excluded
2256,"Perfusion MRI detects rCBF abnormalities in early stages of HIV- cognitive motor complex. Objective: To evaluate patients with early HIV-cognitive motor complex (HIV-CMC) for possible regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) abnormalities on perfusion MRI (pMRI). Background(s): Nuclear medicine techniques have demonstrated global and focal cerebral perfusion abnormalities in patients with HIV dementia. Ultrafast pMRI enables the measurement of rCBF throughout the brain without the need to apply radioactive tracers or ionizing radiation. Method(s): pMRI was used to measure the rCBF in 19 patients with early stages of HIV-CMC and 15 healthy seronegative control subjects. The rCBF maps were registered to high-resolution anatomic MRI scans and transformed into Talairach space. Statistical analysis of the rCBF maps was performed with SPM96. Result(s): Compared with the control subjects, the patients with HIV had statistically significantly decreased rCBF bilaterally in the inferior lateral frontal cortices (right: -15%, p < 0.002; left: -12%, p < 0.005) and in the inferior medial parietal brain region (-15%, p < 0.0009). In contrast, rCBF was increased bilaterally in the posterior inferior parietal white matter (right: +19%, p < 0.0001; left: +17%, p < 0.001). Furthermore, rCBF abnormalities correlated significantly with clinical disease severity as measured by CD4 count, plasma viral load, Karnofsky score, and HIV dementia scale. Discussion(s): Our results are consistent with previous findings from PET and SPECT studies. Furthermore, pMRI can detect rCBF abnormalities that correlate with disease severity in HIV-CMC. Because pMRI is more cost-effective, faster, and safer than nuclear medicine techniques for monitoring rCBF changes, pMRI may be more feasible for monitoring the effects of therapy for HIV-CMC.",Excluded
2918,"Site-specific cancer incidence and mortality after cerebral angiography with radioactive thorotrast. Few opportunities exist to evaluate the carcinogenic effects of long-term internal exposure to alpha-particle-emitting radionuclides. Patients injected with Thorotrast (thorium-232) during radiographic procedures, beginning in the 1930s, provide one such valuable opportunity. We evaluated site-specific cancer incidence and mortality among an international cohort of 3,042 patients injected during cerebral angiography with either Thorotrast (n = 1,650) or a nonradioactive agent (n = 1,392) and who survived 2 or more years. Standardized incidence ratios (SIR) for Thorotrast and comparison patients (Denmark and Sweden) were estimated and relative risks (RR), adjusted for population, age and sex, were generated with multivariate statistical modeling. For U.S. patients, comparable procedures were used to estimate standardized mortality ratios (SMR) and RR, representing the first evaluation of long-term, site-specific cancer mortality in this group. Compared with nonexposed patients, significantly increased risks in Thorotrast patients were observed for all incident cancers combined (RR = 3.4, 95% CI 2.9-4.1, n = 480, Denmark and Sweden) and for cancer mortality (RR = 4.0, 95% CI 2.5-6.7, n = 114, U.S.). Approximately 335 incident cancers were above expectation, with large excesses seen for cancers of the liver, bile ducts and gallbladder (55% or 185 excess cancers) and leukemias other than CLL (8% or 26 excess cancers). The RR of all incident cancers increased with time since angiography (P < 0.001) and was threefold at 40 or more years; significant excesses (SIR = 4.0) persisted for 50 years. Increasing cumulative dose of radiation was associated with an increasing risk of all incident cancers taken together and with cancers of the liver, gallbladder, and peritoneum and other digestive sites; similar findings were observed for U.S. cancer mortality. A marginally significant dose response was observed for the incidence of pancreas cancer (P = 0.05) but not for lung cancer. Our study confirms the relationship between Thorotrast and increased cancer incidence at sites of Thorotrast deposition and suggests a possible association with pancreas cancer. After injection with >20 ml Thorotrast, the cumulative excess risk of cancer incidence remained elevated for up to 50 years and approached 97%. Caution is needed in interpreting the excess risks observed for site-specific cancers, however, because of the potential bias associated with the selection of cohort participants, noncomparability with respect to the internal or external comparison groups, and confounding by indication. Nonetheless, the substantial risks associated with liver cancer and leukemia indicate that unique and prolonged exposure to alpha-particle-emitting Thorotrast increased carcinogenic risks.",Excluded
2524,"Current attitudes of Turkish anesthesiologists to radiation exposure. Purpose: The aim of this study was to investigate the attitudes of anesthesiologists to radiation exposure and current safety practice in Turkey. Method(s): The study enrolled anesthesiologists from all over Turkey, including all levels of academic degrees and all types of different institutions. Questionnaire forms were sent via e-mail to 505 anesthesiologists. The survey collected demographic data such as age, gender, position, and the institution at which the participant worked, and data about the frequency of radiation exposure during procedures and the participant's attitudes concerning radiation safety measures during these procedures. Result(s): The questionnaire forms were delivered to 491 anesthesiologists, and 301 (61.3 %) of these were returned. Of these, 9 had not completed the questionnaire because of a lack of exposure to radiation. Among the remaining 292 personnel, the weekly frequencies of radiation exposure were more than five times (36.7 %), one to five times (50.3 %), and less than once (13 %) per week, respectively. Only a few anesthesiologists regularly wore a lead apron (30.11 %) and a thyroid shield (11.3 %) during procedures involving radiation exposure. Conclusion(s): This study demonstrated that nearly all anesthesiologists are regularly exposed to radiation and that few anesthesiologists in Turkey wear protective clothing, which is essential for radiation protection. Therefore, if it is not, increasing awareness about radiation protection should be an integral part of medical training and education. © 2013 Japanese Society of Anesthesiologists.",Excluded
1071,"Neuropathology of intracranial arteriovenous malformations following conventional radiation therapy. Conventional fractionated radiation therapy was used in 15 patients to treat arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) of the brain deemed inoperable or incompletely obliterated using endovascular or surgical techniques. The AVMs measured from 0.8 to 85 cm3 (mean 28.2 cm3; median 24 cm3). Angiography in 12 patients 1-21 years following radiation therapy demonstrated no significant change in 7, slight reduction in 2, near complete obliteration in 1, and complete obliteration in 2. Magnetic resonance imaging further demonstrated apparent obliteration in one other case. Three irradiated AVMs were available for pathological examination following fatal recurrent hemorrhage after 21 years in case 1 and following surgery after 5 years in cases 2 and 3. Doses of 20 and 45 Gy were delivered to the area of the AVM in 10 and 15 fractions with a 6-MV linear accelerator in case 1 and in cases 2 and 3, respectively. A blinded histopathological comparison was made of the latter cases and three AVMs removed at surgery that were not previously irradiated and that were comparable in size, number of arterial feeders, and location within the brain. Segmental hyalinization of some blood vessels was seen in both irradiated and nonirradiated cases. The single postmortem specimen showed extensive thrombosis but a patent nidus. The findings are in keeping with the clinical impression that conventional fractionated radiation therapy fails to alter the natural history of cerebral AVMs. The favorable outcome of radiosurgery on small- to medium-sized AVMs appears attributable to the shorter duration of therapy using relatively high-dose prescriptions to the nidus.",Excluded

1675,"Preoperative radiotherapy contributes to induction of proliferative activity of CD8+ tumor-infiltrating T-cells in oral squamous cell carcinoma. In order to evaluate host immune response to cancer, many methods have been applied. However, in the field of oral squamous cell carcinoma, evaluation of host immune response on the basis of proliferative activity of tumor-infiltrating T-cells (TIL) has not been reported. Therefore, we applied double immunohistochemical staining of proliferation markers Ki-67 and CD8 to surgically resected and paraffin-embedded tissue sections for 35 cases of oral squamous cell carcinoma. With this method, there was a significant correlation between the percentage of Ki-67+CD8+TIL and the intra-tumor epithelium infiltration rate of CD8+TIL (P=0.0237). In the process of analysis, we found that the proliferative activity of CD8+TIL tended to correlate (P=0.0859) with clinical N factor (lymph node metastasis), which was previously reported to suppress host immune response. We therefore assumed there was another factor inducing host immune response. The proliferative activity of CD8+TIL was well correlated with preoperative radiotherapy (P=0.0200) while there was no significant correlation between the proliferative activity of CD8+TIL and other clinical factors; age, tumor size, clinical stage, pathological N factor (P=0.5410, 0.7769, 0.1041, and 0.1072, respectively).

Acceptability, knowledge, and clarity of values related to the decision were assessed., RESULTS: Fifty-two patients completed the study (mean age=58.5 years; mean duration smoking=34.8 years). Acceptability of the aid was high. Most patients (78.8%) indicated greater interest in screening after viewing the aid. Knowledge about lung cancer screening increased significantly as a result of viewing the aid (25.5% of questions answered correctly before the aid, and 74.8% after; P<.01) although understanding of screening eligibility remained poor. Patients reported being clear about which benefits and harms of screening mattered most to them (94.1% and 86.5%, respectively)., CONCLUSIONS: Patients have high information needs related to lung cancer screening. A video-based decision aid may be helpful in promoting informed decision-making, but its impact on lung cancer screening decisions needs to be explored. Copyright © 2014 Elsevier Inc.

2230,"Does mountaineering increase the incidence of cutaneous melanoma? A hypothesis based on cancer registry data. Exposure to ultraviolet radiation is considered a major risk factor for the development of cutaneous melanoma. In white populations in Australia or the USA, the melanoma incidence increases with the vicinity of residence to the equator. In Europe decreasing incidence rates towards southern countries may be due to the darker pigmentation of the Mediterranean population. The comparison of age-standardized incidence rates (world standard population) in Europe shows that Swiss cancer registries and the Austrian Tyrol registry have much higher incidence rates for cutaneous melanoma than other Central European cancer registries. The excess of Swiss/Austrian incidence rates is even more pronounced when head localization is analysed separately. Due to the altitude-related increase in UV radiation two possible explanations for the Swiss/Austrian excess rates may be considered: firstly, as a result of the altitude of residence, higher UV exposure is generally present in these countries; secondly, mountaineering activities may additionally increase UV exposure.",Excluded
2057,"Dependency of the interaural phase difference sensitivities of inferior collicular neurons on a preceding tone and its implications in neural population coding. This study examined the sensitivities of the neuronal responses in the inferior colliculus (IC) to the interaural phase difference (IPD) of a preceding tone, and explored its implications in the neural-population representation of the IPD. Single-unit responses were recorded from the IC of anesthetized gerbils. The stimulus was a dichotic tone sequence with a common frequency (typically the unit's best frequency) and level (10-20 dB relative to the threshold), consisting of a conditioner (200 ms) followed by a probe (50 ms) with a silent gap (5-100 ms) between them. The IPDs of the 2 tones were varied independently. The presence of a conditioner generally suppressed the probe-driven responses; the effect size increased as the conditioner IPD approached the unit's most responsive IPD. The units' preferred IPDs were relatively invariant with the conditioner IPD. Two types of models were used to evaluate the effects of a conditioner on the IPD representation at the level of IC neural population. One was a version of the population-vector model. The other was the hemispheric-channel model, which assumed that the stimulus IPD is represented by the activities of 2 broadly tuned hemispheric channels. Both models predicted that, in the presence of a conditioner, the IPD representation would shift in a direction away from the conditioner IPD. This appears to emphasize the difference between the conditioner and the probe IPDs. The results indicate that in the IC, neural processes for IPD adapt to the stimulus history to enhance the representational contrast between successive sounds.",Excluded
1133,"A propensity-score matching analysis comparing long-term survival of surgery alone and postoperative treatment for patients in node positive or stage III esophageal squamous cell carcinoma after R0 esophagectomy. Background: Surveillance was recommended for patients after R0 esophagectomy by National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) guidelines. However, local failure was high in locally advanced patients (48-78%). The present study aimed to determine whether adjuvant treatment improved survival for stage IIb-III thoracic esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (TESCC). Method(s): A retrospective review of patients diagnosed as esophageal carcinoma at the Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences Cancer hospital, between January 2004 and December 2011, was performed. A database compiling 975 patents with node positive or stage III thoracic esophageal carcinoma after R0 surgery with or without postoperative radiation/chemoradiation was created. A 1:1 matched study group was generated by the Greedy method after propensity score matching (PSM) analysis. Survival curves were calculated by the Kaplan-Meier method and compared with the log-rank test. Univariate and multivariate analyses were using the Cox proportional hazards regression model. Result(s): 975 patients were enrolled in the study, 510 patients (52.3%) did not receive any postoperative treatment after R0 surgery and 465 patients had either postoperative chemoradiation or radiotherapy. Median follow-up was 69.2 months. After PSM, 222 well-balanced patients in each group demonstrated the same results. The 3-year, 5-year survival rates and median survival in surgery group (33.0%, 26.4%, 24.3 months) were inferior to those in postoperative treatment group (48.3%, 37.1% and 34.3 months), (P = 0.002). Compared with radiotherapy, postoperative chemoradiation did not improve DFS and OS (P = 0.692; P = 0.368). N stage and adjuvant treatment are independent prognostic factors. Conclusion(s): Adjuvant treatment could improve survival for patients with stage IIb-III TESCC.Copyright © 2019",Excluded
3593,"New effective dose estimates for Rubidium-82 based on dynamic PET/CT imaging in humans. Objectives Published radiation dose estimates for Rubidium-82 vary widely, and no comprehensive study in man has yet been conducted. With the increasing use of Rb-82 PET for myocardial perfusion imaging, improved dosimetry information is needed for accurate risk assessment. The purpose of this study was to measure Rb-82 internal organ and effective doses with PET/CT in humans. Methods We recruited 26 cardiac patients and 4 normal subjects with no cardiac history. Dynamic 3D PET scans were acquired (GE Discovery RX/VCT) over 10 minutes following IV injection of 10 MBq/kg Rb-82. Images were reconstructed using FORE-OSEM and 8 mm Hann filter. Cardiac scans of the chest were acquired at rest for all 30 subjects, plus one additional scan of the Head, Neck, Abdomen, Pelvis, or Thighs. Mean Rb-82 residence times were determined in 22 source organs using volumes-of-interest (VOI) drawn on the fused PET/CT images. For large organs a small VOI was used to avoid partial volume losses. For small organs the average activity above 80% threshold was multiplied by the volume at 40% of the peak value within the organ VOI. Target organ doses and the effective dose estimate were calculated using OLINDA/EXM 1.0 according to ICRP 60, and recalculated according to ICRP 103. Results A total of 283 organs were measured across the 60 scans, with at least 4 samples obtained in each source organ. The average 'adult' effective dose for Rubidium-82 was found to be 0.00074 mSv/MBq using ICRP 60. Using ICRP 103, the male and female effective doses were 0.00074 and 0.00092 mSv/MBq respectively. The highest absorbed organ dose was to the kidneys. Conclusions These dose estimates for Rubidium-82 are the first to be measured directly with PET/CT in humans, and are 4 to 4.5 times lower than previous ICRP 60 values based on a theoretical blood flow model. The new values derived from human studies suggest a typical effective dose of 0.6 mSv per scan with 3D PET.",Excluded
557,"A randomized trial of sodium alginate prevention of esophagitis in LA-NSCLC receiving chemoradiotherapy: OLCSG1401. Background: Radiation esophagitis is a critical adverse event that needs to be appropriately managed while administering thoracic irradiation. This trial aimed to investigate whether sodium alginate has preventative effects on esophagitis in patients with non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) receiving concurrent chemoradiotherapy (CRT). Method(s): Patients with untreated stage III NSCLC who were eligible for concurrent CRT were randomly assigned at a 1:1:1 ratio to receive one of the following treatments: initial or late use of oral sodium alginate (arms A and B) or water as control (arm C). The primary endpoint was the proportion of patients developing G3 or worse esophagitis. Result(s): Overall, 94 patients were randomly assigned between February 2014 and September 2018. The study was prematurely terminated because of slow accrual. The proportions of patients with G3 or worse esophagitis were 12.5%, 9.8%, and 19.4% in arms A, B, and C, respectively. Patients receiving sodium alginate had fewer onsets of G3 esophagitis; however, differences compared with arm C were not significant (A vs. C: p = 0.46; B vs. C: p = 0.28). The rates of grade 3 or worse non-hematologic toxicities besides esophagitis were 29%, 26%, and 43% in arms A, B, and C, respectively. Interestingly, compared with arm C, a low rate of febrile neutropenia was observed in arm A (3.1% vs. 19.4%: p = 0.04). Conclusion(s): Sodium alginate did not show significant preventative effects on radiation-induced esophagitis in patients with NSCLC. The frequency of CRT-induced febrile neutropenia was lower in the early use sodium alginate arm.

517,"Endovascular Treatment of Long Superficial Femoral Artery-Chronic Total Occlusions Using the Gogo Catheter With IVUS Via a Popliteal Puncture Method Is Effective, Safe, and Useful. Objectives: We aimed to investigate the usefulness of inserting a 6Fr sheath guided by duplex ultrasonography via a popliteal artery puncture. We also aimed to demonstrate endoluminal tracking using a retrograde approach using the Gogo catheter with intravascular ultrasound (IVUS). Background(s): The bidirectional approach is useful for increasing the success rate of the procedure for long superficial femoral artery-chronic total occlusions (SFA-CTOs). However, this procedure becomes somewhat complicated. Since the proximal blood vessel diameter is clearly larger than the distal end of the CTO and the body surface duplex guide can also be used in the proximal part, it is easier to introduce a retrograde guidewire (GW) into the proximal end. Method(s): We performed endovascular treatment for long SFA-CTOs with a Gogo catheter + IVUS guide in 31 consecutive cases (male 20/female 11; mean age, 75.6 +/- 7.6) from May 2017 to November 2018. We advanced the IVUS until the true lumen could be confirmed and advanced the Gogo catheter toward the IVUS for reinforcement. We attempted to approach the long CTO by repeating this procedure. We named this procedure the GIP method (GIP: Gogo catheter with IVUS via a popliteal puncture). Hemostasis of the popliteal artery was achieved using a commercially available compression hemostatic kit (Tometa-kun, XEMEX, Japan). Result(s): Successful revascularization was achieved in all cases (in 2 cases, a femoral artery puncture was added, and a bidirectional approach was used, and in 1 case, a CROSSER system was used). On average, the fluoroscopy time was 42.2 +/- 30.4 minutes, radiation dose 93.7 +/- 78.7 mGy, and amount of contrast medium used 15.0 +/- 9.6 mL. The procedure time was defined as from the start of the popliteal artery puncture to the time the GW passed through the CTO lesion, including the posture transformation time from prone to the supine position. The procedure time was 42.1 +/- 40.2 minutes. There were no major adverse events or other major complications, such as a distal embolism, rupture of the CTO lesion, arteriovenous fistula, or major hematoma requiring a transfusion or surgical treatment. Only 2 small hematomas occurred at the popliteal artery puncture site. The patients were treated conservatively and were discharged as usual. Conclusion(s): Endovascular treatment of long SFA-CTOs via the popliteal approach was effective and safe. Using the GIP method to address long SFA-CTOs is recommended.Copyright © The Author(s) 2020.",Excluded

INTRODUCTION: Of oncological patients who have undergone chest radiation therapy, 20% develop radiation-induced constrictive pericarditis. The purpose of this study was to review our clinic's experience of such cases, focusing on survival and the functional outcome., METHODS: Six patients with a history of previous radiation therapy, aged 33-61 years, most of whom had symptoms of heart failure, underwent radical (2 patients) or partial (4 patients) pericardiectomy., RESULTS: All patients were completely free of cardiovascular events during the 8 years covered by the study. Among the postoperative complications the most serious was low cardiac output syndrome in 4 patients, which was treated successfully., CONCLUSIONS: Radiation-induced constrictive pericarditis is a clinical entity that should be taken into account in the differential diagnosis of oncological patients who show signs of heart failure. Surgery is the only effective treatment. The results are satisfactory, but always depend on associated damage to the myocardium as a result of radiation and on the underlying cancer.",Excluded

We retrospectively investigated the therapeutic outcomes of our series of 7 Ta and 62 T1 bladder cancers with grade 3 (G3) malignancy in 61 men and 8 women having a mean age of 66.2 years. Following transurethral resection of bladder tumor (TURBT), 35 and 6 patients received intravesical instillations of bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) and anthracycline-derivants, respectively, whereas 15 received no adjuvant therapy. Five and 2 patients received systemic and local chemotherapy with irradiation, respectively, and six underwent radical cystectomy for invasive potential. The 5-year non-recurrence, progression-free, and overall (cancer-specific) survival rates were 66, 82%, and 76 (88) %, respectively, after a median follow-up of 52 months. The 5-year non-recurrence rates were 24% in non-adjuvant, 85% in BCG, 0% in anthracycline-derivants, 65% in systemic and local chemoradiation therapy, and 68% in cystectomy. The 5-year progression-free and overall (cancer-specific) survival rates of the patients treated with BCG instillation were 91% and 94(100)%. There were no significant differences in the 5-year non-recurrence and progression-free rates between 12 patients with carcinoma in situ (CIS) and 23 patients without CIS. Complete TUR of all visible tumors and a reliable histopathological diagnosis of appropriate specimens bearing the muscle layer are mandatory for assessment of recurrence. G3 Ta-1 bladder cancers and CIS showed a high risk of recurrence, and required aggressive treatment. Since BCG therapy following TURBT significantly reduced the risk of recurrence and progression, adjuvant BCG therapy is considered to be the most promising initial conservative treatment for G3 Ta-1 bladder cancers.",Excluded
645,"Electromagnetic navigation diagnostic bronchoscopy in peripheral lung lesions. BACKGROUND: Electromagnetic navigation bronchoscopy (ENB) with biopsy under fluoroscopic guidance has enhanced the yield of flexible bronchoscopy in the diagnosis of peripheral lung lesions. However, the accuracy of ENB navigation suggests that the addition of fluoroscopy is redundant., OBJECTIVES: Data were prospectively collected to determine the yield of ENB without fluoroscopy in the diagnosis of peripheral lung lesions., METHOD: ENB was performed via flexible bronchoscopy (superDimension/Bronchus system; superDimension Inc; Plymouth, MN). Biopsy specimens were obtained through the extended working channel after navigation. Fluoroscopy was not utilized, but post-transbronchial biopsy chest radiographs were obtained to exclude pneumothorax. The primary end point was diagnostic yield, and the secondary end points were navigation accuracy, procedure duration, and safety. Analysis by lobar distribution was also performed to assess performance in different lobes of the lung., RESULTS: Ninety-two peripheral lung lesions were biopsied in the 89 subjects. The diagnostic yield of ENB was 67%, which was independent of lesion size. Total procedure time ranged from 16.3 to 45.0 min (mean [+/- SD] procedure time, 26.9 +/- 6.5 min). The mean navigation error was 9 +/- 6 mm (range, 1 to 31 mm). There were two incidences of pneumothorax for which no intervention was required. When analyzed by lobar distribution, there was a trend toward a higher ENB yield in diagnosing lesions in the right middle lobe (88%)., CONCLUSIONS: ENB can be used as a stand-alone bronchoscopic technique without compromising diagnostic yield or increasing the risk of pneumothorax. This may result in sizable timesaving and avoids radiation exposure.",Excluded
644,"Radiosurgical decompression of metastatic epidural compression. BACKGROUND: Surgical decompression of metastatic epidural compression (MEC) improved ambulatory function. Spine radiosurgery can accurately target the epidural tumor and deliver high radiation doses for tumor control. Therefore, a clinical trial was performed to quantitatively determine the degree of epidural decompression by radiosurgery of metastatic epidural compression. METHOD(S): Sixty-two patients with a total of 85 lesions of metastatic epidural compression were treated. Epidural compression was diagnosed by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans. Main criteria of inclusion were neurological status with muscle power 4 of 5 or better. Radiosurgery was performed to the involved spine segment, including the epidural mass with median dose of 16 Gy (range 12-20 Gy) in a single session. All patients had prospective clinical follow-up, ranging from 1-48 months (median 11.5 months), and 36 patients had pretreatment and post-treatment imaging, ranging from 2-33 months (median 9.3 months). Primary endpoints were epidural tumor control and thecal sac decompression. RESULT(S): The mean epidural tumor volume reduction was 65 +/- 14% at 2 months after radiosurgery. The epidural tumor area at the level of the most severe spinal cord compression was 0.82 +/- 0.08 cm2 before radiosurgery and 0.41 +/- 0.06 cm2 after radiosurgery (P < .001). Thecal sac patency improved from 55 +/- 4% to 76 +/- 3% (P < .001). Overall, neurological function improved in 81%. CONCLUSION(S): This study demonstrated a radiosurgical decompression of epidural tumor. Although neurosurgical decompression and radiotherapy is the standard treatment in patients with good performance, radiosurgical decompression can be a viable noninvasive treatment option for malignant epidural compression. © 2010 American Cancer Society.",Excluded
1981,"Outcomes and toxicity following high-dose radiation therapy in 15 fractions for non-small cell lung cancer. PURPOSE: Accelerated hypofractionated radiation therapy (AHRT) is increasingly used for select lung cancer patients. We evaluated clinical outcomes and predictors of pulmonary/esophageal toxicity in patients treated with >=52.5 Gy in 15 fractions., METHODS AND MATERIALS: We evaluated 229 patients treated with radiation therapy doses >=52.5 Gy in 15 fractions for non-small cell lung cancer from January 2009 through January 2016. Toxicity was scored using Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events, v4.0. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression was used to identify predictors of toxicity. Overall survival, progression-free survival, and local control were estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method. Predictors of clinical outcome were modeled using Cox proportional hazards regression., RESULTS: Median follow-up was 7 months. Forty-two patients (19%) developed grade >=2 pneumonitis, and 9 (4%) developed grade >=3 esophagitis. In multivariate analysis, age >75 years (odds ratio [OR], 2.56; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.24-5.25; P = .01) and percentage of lung volume receiving doses of >10 Gy higher than 32% were associated with grade >=2 pneumonitis (OR, 2.79; 95% CI, 1.39-5.79; P = .005). On univariate analysis, esophagus mean dose >=17 Gy (OR, 10.14; 95% CI, 1.82-189.8; P = .006), gross tumor volume size >=71 cm3 (P = .002), and planning target volume size >=409 cm3 (P = .02) were associated with development of grade >=3 esophagitis. In patients with stage II/III disease (n = 73), median local control was not reached, median overall survival was 14 months, and median progression-free survival was 6 months., CONCLUSIONS: AHRT in 15 fractions can be safe and effective.

1465,"Cancer incidence among Danish Thorotrast-exposed patients. BACKGROUND: Studies of groups of patients given injections of the alpha-emitting x-ray contrast medium Thorotrast may provide information on human alpha-ray carcinogenesis., PURPOSE: We re-established a formerly identified cohort of neurological patients receiving injections of Thorotrast for cerebral arteriography and assessed their incidence of cancer., METHODS: Using the national population register, the Danish Cancer Registry, and other registers, we determined the incidence of cancer among Thorotrast-injected patients. Incidence ratios were standardized to the general population and computed for different cancer sites., RESULTS: The cumulative risk for cancer at all sites (excluding brain tumors where the standardized incidence ratio [SIR] was 28) reached 86% 50 years after Thorotrast injection. SIR was greatly elevated at all sites except the brain and CNS (3.3, 95% confidence interval = 3.0-3.7), mainly because of liver cancers (SIR = 126) as well as leukemia (SIR = 10) for which a relationship was found between the time since injection and the estimated dose (but not the age at injection). Other sites with significantly increased risks of cancer included the gallbladder and extrahepatic bile ducts (SIR = 14), peritoneum (SIR = 8.6), sites of multiple myeloma (SIR = 4.6), metastatic sites (SIR = 12), and unspecified sites (SIR = 11). Cancers of the lung and breast also occurred in significant excess, but no relationship between SIR and volume of injected Thorotrast or time since injection was observed. Cancer risk was increased at most other sites, although this increase was not statistically significant., CONCLUSION: Alpha radiation may account for the increased risk of tumors of the liver, gallbladder, and peritoneum as well as leukemia and multiple myeloma, whereas confounding factors most probably contribute to the increased risks at other sites.",Excluded

This study aimed at evaluating long-term (24-month) effects of beta-irradiation (188Re-MAG3-filled balloon) using intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) in patients with in-stent restenosis (ISR). Long-term effects of beta-irradiation on intimal hyperplasia (IH) within the stented segment and vessel and lumen dimensions of nonstented adjacent segments in patients with ISR have not been sufficiently evaluated. Two-year follow-up IVUS was performed in 30 patients with patent ISR segments at 6-month follow-up angiography. Serial IVUS images were acquired at five equidistant intrastent sites and at three different reference segment sites. IH burden (%) was defined as 100 x (IH/stent area). Mean intrastent IH area and IH burden significantly increased between 6 and 24 months, from 2.1 +/- 1.1 to 2.6 +/-v 1.4 mm2 (P < 0.001) and from 26% +/- 10% to 33% +/- 14% (P < 0.001), respectively. There was a significant decrease of mean external elastic membrane (from 10.1 +/- 3.9 to 9.7 +/- 3.9 mm2; P = 0.015) and lumen area (from 5.6 +/- 2.3 to 5.1 +/- 2.3 mm2; P = 0.021) within distal reference segments between 6 and 24 months. Target lesion revascularization (TLR) was performed in six patients (20%) between 6 and 24 months after beta-irradiation therapy. There were no significant differences between TLR and non-TLR groups except for a smaller minimum lumen area at 24 months in the TLR group. Because of a small amount of late loss between 6 and 24 months, most irradiated ISR vessel segments remained stable for up to 2 years.

603,"Which is the preferred modality of renal access for a trainee urologist: Ultrasonography or fluoroscopy? results of a prospective randomized trial. Background and Purpose: In percutaneous nephrolithotomy (PCNL), placement of the access tract into the kidney is an important aspect of the procedure and is responsible for the steep learning curve associated with the operation. The aim of the current prospective randomized trial was to assess the duration of radiation exposure along with the safety and efficacy of PCNL done by a trainee, utilizing either ultrasonography (US) or fluoroscopic guidance to obtain access., Patients and Methods: Sixty-four patients with <=3cm renal calculi undergoing single-tract PCNL by trainee urologists (experience of <25 PCNL's) were randomized into US-and fluoroscopic-guided access groups (32 in each). In Group 1 (US guided), puncture was done using a 3.5/5MHz US probe with a puncture attachment, whereas the triangulation technique with biplanar C-arm fluoroscopy was utilized in group 2 (fluoroscopic guided). Patient demographics, stone parameters, intraoperative characteristics, fluoroscopy durations, and postoperative outcomes were analyzed., Results: Both groups were comparable as far as patient and stone characteristics were concerned. The fluoroscopy exposure during the puncture phase (T2) and overall (T) was significantly lower in the US group at 9.0+/-20.8 vs 43.8+/-34.8, (p<0.0001) and 204.3+/-84 vs 239.9+/-77.5, (p=0.04). Six patients in group1 required fluoroscopic adjustment (p=0.03). All other intra-and postoperative parameters were similar in both the groups. Conclusion(s): Both ultrasound and fluoroscopic guidance for renal access are equally safe and feasible in the hands of a trainee urologist. Total fluoroscopy duration and exposure time during puncture were both significantly less in the ultrasound group. Expertise in fluoroscopic-guided access is essential for a novice to effectively achieve access in all possible situations.Copyright © 2014, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.",Excluded

No significant difference was observed between the two groups, regarding chromatid break frequencies in treated G<inf>2</inf> lymphocytes. The distribution of bleomycin-induced breaks in each group of chromosomes was similar for DS and controls. No significant difference was found in the response to bleomycin between male and female subjects. Probably, the main factor involved in chromosome sensitivity of lymphocytes from patients with DS is the phase of the cell cycle in which the cell is treated.",Excluded
1328,"Potential risk factors and outcomes of fistulas between the upper intestinal tract and the airway following Ivor-Lewis esophagectomy. Fistulas between the upper intestinal tract and the airway following esophagectomy are a rare and severe complication with significant mortality. Treatment and therapy are difficult and require a multidisciplinary approach. The objective of this retrospective study was to identify risk factors for these fistulas following esophagetcomy, and to assess their impact on the further clinical course and outcome. 211 patients undergoing Ivor-Lewis esophagectomy for esophageal cancer between 2005 and 2012 were included. The preoperative risk factors including the risk score according to Schroder et al. and theO-Physiological and Operative Severity Score (POSSUM) score, operative and postoperative parameters and the outcome were evaluated. 65% of all patients developed postoperative complications, including 12 patients that developed fistulas between the upper intestinal tract and the airway (airway fistulas [AF]; 5.6%). Neither patient related risk factors nor esophagus-specific risk scores correlated with occurrence of AF. Furthermore, surgical treatment and neoadjuvant treatment did not show any effect on development of AF in our patients. However, we could demonstrate that AF significantly impacted on length of hospital stay (AF 52 days vs. No-AF group 16 days, P < 0.001), incidence of major pulmonary complications (83.3% vs. 17.1%, P < 0.001), 90-day mortality (42% vs. 7.5%, P=0.002) and overall survival (133 days vs. 636 days, P=0.029).With the current study, we could not identify any patient related risk factors, esophagus-specific risk scores or treatment related details that might be useful as predictors of AF after Ivor-Lewis esophagectomy.

602,"Lung tumour induction in mice after uniform and non-uniform external thoracic X-irradiation. The aim of this study was to investigate the validity of the ICRP procedure of using average tissue/organ dose in estimating carcinogenic risk. It has been suggested that highly non-uniform exposure ('hot spots') is much more carcinogenic than an equivalent dose delivered uniformly. In a series of experiments, mice were irradiated with X-rays either uniformly to the thorax or non-uniformly with 72 1-mm microbeams which irradiated approximately 20 per cent of the total lung volume. Two experiments involving uniform irradiation showed a peaked tumour incidence curve with a maximum at 5 Gy. The first 'microbeam' study also produced a pronounced peak in the dose response with a maximum tumour incidence at 1 Gy average lung dose or 5 Gy to the irradiated lung tissue. This implied the use of average tissue dose might underestimate the carcinogenic hazard of non-uniform exposure. Later, more extensive, microbeam experiments failed to replicate this finding. The results were nearly similar to those for uniform irradiation, with a slight increase in tumour incidence from 2.5-5.0 Gy average lung dose. These results imply that for these irradiation conditions the ICRP dose averaging procedure remains valid.",Excluded
776,"Barrier requirements as the evolutionary Driver"" of epidermal pigmentation in humans"". Current explanations for the development of epidermal pigmentation during human evolution are not tenable as stand-alone hypotheses. Accordingly, we assessed instead whether xeric- and UV-B-induced stress to the epidermal permeability barrier, critical to survival in a terrestrial environment, could have driven"" the development of epidermal pigmentation. (1) Megadroughts prevailed in central Africa when hominids expanded into open savannahs [=1.5-0.8 million years ago], resulting in sustained exposure to both extreme aridity and erythemogenic UV-B, correlating with genetic evidence that pigment developed =1.2 million years ago. (2) Pigmented skin is endowed with enhanced permeability barrier function, stratum corneum integrity/cohesion, and a reduced susceptibility to infections. The enhanced function of pigmented skin can be attributed to the lower pH of the outer epidermis, likely due to the persistence of (more-acidic) melanosomes into the outer epidermis, as well as the conservation of genes associated with eumelanin synthesis and melanosome acidification (e.g., TYR, OCA2 [p protein], SLC24A5, SLC45A2, MATP) in pigmented populations. Five keratinocyte-derived signals (stem cell factor)KIT; FOXn1)FGF2; IL-1alpha , NGF, and p53) are potential candidates to have stimulated the sequential development of epidermal pigmentation in response to stress to the barrier. We summarize evidence here that epidermal interfollicular pigmentation in early hominids likely evolved in response to stress to the permeability barrier. Am. J. Hum.

3312,"Study design for a case-control investigation of cellular telephones and other risk factors for brain tumours in adults. The aetiology of brain tumours is poorly understood. Due, in part, to public concern about a postulated relationship between the use of cellular telephones or other increasingly prevalent environmental exposures and the incidence of brain cancer in adults, the National Cancer Institute is collaborating with three US hospitals in a comprehensive case-control study of malignant and benign brain tumours. Factors under consideration include use of cellular phones and other wireless communication devices, workplace exposures to chemical agents and electromagnetic fields, dietary factors, family history of tumours, genetic determinants of susceptibility, home appliance use, reproductive history and hormonal exposures, viruses, medical and dental exposure to ionising radiation, and other aspects of medical history. Approximately 800 newly diagnosed brain tumour cases and 800 controls were enrolled at hospitals in Boston, Phoenix and Pittsburgh from 1994 to 1998. Cases include all adults (age >= 18 y) newly diagnosed with a histologically confirmed intracranial glioma, histologically confirmed intracranial meningioma or acoustic neuroma. Controls are patients admitted to the same hospitals as the cases, and treated for any of a variety of non-malignant conditions. Key features of the study include its large size, the emphasis on rapid ascertainment of incident cases and interview of study subjects rather than surrogate respondents, the use of detailed, job-specific questions developed by industrial hygienists to ascertain occupational exposures, and the storage of blood samples for future evaluation of inherited susceptibility, biomarkers of exposure and gene-environment interactions.",Excluded
2639,"Challenging management of gingival squamous cell carcinoma: A 10 years single-center retrospective study on Northern-Italian patients. Background: Aim of this study was to describe the outcome of patients with gingival squamous cell carcinoma (GSCC), and to recognize aspects affecting clinical course and to consider survival rate. Material(s) and Method(s): The case records of patients, over a 10-year period, were retrospectively examined. Differences in distribution of the potential risk factors by prognosis were investigated through non-parametrical tests (Wilcoxon Rank-Sum and Fisher's Exact). Survival curves for age, therapy and stage were built by the Kaplan- Meier method and compared with Log-Rank test. Result(s): 79 patients were analysed. Significant increase in mortality for patients older than 77 and for those with advanced stages was found. Cumulative survival rate 5 years after the diagnosis was 43%, while at 10 years was of 11%. Conclusion(s): With a statistical relationship between age and tumour stage with survival rates, and 70% of GSCC cases identified as stage IV, early GSCC diagnosis remains challenging.Copyright © Medicina Oral S.

1377,"Predictors of aortic dilation in patients with coarctation of the aorta: Evaluation with dual-source computed tomography. Background: Coarctation of aorta (CoA) may progressively develop aortic dilation at other site of the aorta and can lead to fatal aortic diseases. We aimed to evaluate the occurrence of aortic dilation and related predictors in patients with CoA using dual-source computed tomography (DSCT). Method(s): Fifty-three patients with CoA identified by DSCT were retrospectively reviewed. Aortic diameters were measured at six different levels and standardized as z-scores based on the square root of body surface area. Coarctation site-diaphragm ratio (CDR) was used to describe the degree of narrowing. A total of 26 patients were included in mild group (CDR > 50%) and 27 in severe group (CDR < 50%) according to the severity of coarctation. Student's t-test and Spearman correlation coefficients, univariate and multivariable logistic regression analyses were used to assess the risk factors including age, degree of narrowing and other malformations for aortic dilation. Result(s): Severe group had significantly larger z-scores of ascending aorta (2.41 +/- 0.39 vs. 2.10 +/- 0.57, p < 0.05) and post-coarctation aorta (2.17 +/- 0.48 vs. 1.68 +/- 0.43, p < 0.001) compared with mild group. Degree of coarctation was associated with the z-scores of the ascending aorta (r = - 0.356, p < 0.05) and post-coarctation aorta (r = - 0.414, p < 0.05). Collateral circulation was related to the z-scores of ascending aorta (r = 0.375, p < 0.05). Increased severity of coarctation was independent predictor of ascending (odds ratio 7.46; 95% CI 1.19-46.76; p < 0.05) and post-coarctation aortic dilation(odds ratio 8.42; 95% CI 1.84-38.56; p < 0.05). Conclusion(s): Ascending and post-coarctation aortic diameters or dilations were both associated with the degree of coarctation. By comprehensively evaluating the aortic diameters and associated malformations including collateral circulation, DSCT can aid in stratification of risk for aortic dilation in patients with CoA.Copyright © 2018 The Author(s).",Excluded
1403,"Disc height and motion patterns in the lumbar spine in patients operated with total disc replacement or fusion for discogenic back pain. Results from a randomized controlled trial. BACKGROUND CONTEXT: Fusion is considered the ""gold standard"" in surgical treatment of degenerated disc disease; the intended postoperative goal is absence of mobility, but treatment may induce degeneration in adjacent segments. Total disc replacement (TDR) aims to restore and maintain mobility by replacing a painful disc. Little is known about the degree and quality of mobility in artificial discs in vivo and whether maintained mobility reduces the stress on adjacent segments that is believed to occur after fusion. PURPOSE: To see if surgical goals for respective treatments had been reached, if clinical outcome was related to this, and if differences in disc height at treated segments and adjacent segment motion patterns between groups occurred. STUDY DESIGN: Comparison of X-ray measurements in a randomized controlled trial between instrumented posterior fusion and TDR for chronic low back pain (CLBP) assumed to be discogenic. Results were compared with clinical outcome. PATIENT SAMPLE: The material consisted of 152 patients suffering from CLBP assumed to be discogenic. Seventy-two patients were treated with fusion and 80 with TDR. OUTCOME MEASURES: Results of X-ray measurements were compared between groups and related to self-reported clinical results regarding back pain and disability. METHOD(S): Flexion-extension X-rays were analyzed preoperatively and 2 years postoperatively using distortion-compensated Roentgen analysis (DCRA) at treated and adjacent levels, and mobility after fusion and TDR was estimated. Changes in disc height and range of motion (ROM) respective translation in adjacent segments were compared between groups. Results of DCRA measurements were also compared with the clinical outcome. RESULT(S): Preoperative flexion-extension ROM was similar between the fusion and TDR groups, and preoperative disc heights of segments to be treated were between one and two standard deviation less than that previously established in a normative database. Seventy percent of fused patients had no mobility, whereas 85% of TDR patients were mobile. Fulfillment of surgical goals was correlated to neither back pain nor disability. Fused segments were lower and TDR segments were higher than normative values postoperatively. There were also significant differences at adjacent segments, there being more translation and flexion-extension in the fusion group than in the TDR group. CONCLUSION(S): This very accurate X-ray method (DCRA) indicates that surgical goals were reached in most patients. This, however, was not correlated to clinical outcome. Differences between the groups in postoperative disc height at treated segments, respective ROM, and translation at adjacent segments did not affect the clinical outcome after 2 years. © 2011 Elsevier Inc.

3326,"Balloon kyphoplasty under three-dimensional radiography guidance. Percutaneous balloon kyphoplasty (PBKP) is generally performed under two-dimensional (2D) radiography guidance (lateral- and anteroposterior (A-P) views) using C-arm fluoroscopy. However, 2D images taken by single-plane or bi-plane fluoroscopy cannot provide information regarding axial views, particularly the Z axis. Lack of information regarding the Z axis prevents the creation of three-dimensional (3D) images. Currently, there has been a progress in interventional X-ray systems, and they are capable of providing 3D radiographic images using a rotational angiography mode which is used to create 3D angiographies. In this report, we described the usefulness of 3D radiography guidance. Patients treated by PBKP was designed to evaluate the efficacy of 3D radiography guidance. These patients experienced osteoporotic vertebral fractures with severe pain. We retrospectively analyzed patients who underwent PBKP from February to December 2016. All patients had a single-level vertebral fracture and underwent surgery by 2D or 3D radiography guidance. We performed 16 patients in 3D radiography guidance, and 10 patients in traditional 2D radiography guidance. This 3D radiography guided PBKP increase the amount of the polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) injection compared with ordinary 2D method. As a result, postoperative vertebral height and alignment were significantly improved. Both groups have no complication. To confirm the final results and make PBKP more effective, 3D radiography guidance is feasible and safe for balloon kyphoplasty.Copyright © 2017 by The Japan Neurosurgical Society.",Excluded
1190,"A phase II trial of accelerated multimodality therapy for locoregionally advanced cancer of the esophagus and gastroesophageal junction: The impact of clinical heterogeneity. OBJECTIVES: This is a report of mature results from a phase II trial of an accelerated multimodality treatment program for locoregionally advanced cancer of the esophagus and gastroesophageal junction with a focus on the impact of clinical heterogeneity on outcomes. A split course of pre- and postoperative hyperfractionated radiation therapy and concurrent chemotherapy was used in an effort to limit perioperative mortality. METHOD(S): Eligibility required a diagnosis of esophageal or gastroesophageal junction cancer and an esophageal ultrasound stage of at least T3, N1, or M1A. Patients received a 12-day induction course of radiation (1.5 Gy twice a dose to a dose of 30 Gy) concurrent with 4-day continuous intravenous infusions of cisplatin (20 mg/m per day) and 5-fluorouracil (1000 mg/m per day) beginning on day 1. Surgery followed in 4 to 6 weeks followed 6 to 10 weeks later by a second, identical course of chemoradiotherapy. RESULT(S): From October 1999 through March 2003, 93 patients were enrolled; 96% were white, 86% male, and 83% had adenocarcinoma. Resection was possible in 83 patients (89%) with 4 (5%) perioperative deaths. With a median follow up of 50 months (range, 34-72 months), the 3-year projected overall survival rate is 27.9%, freedom from recurrence 30.5%, and distant metastatic control 32.4%. Locoregional control in resected patients is 86%. Freedom from recurrence and distant control were significantly better in patients with 1) earlier pretreatment clinical stage, 2) earlier postinduction pathologic stage, 3) squamous cell cancer, and 4) a pathologic response. CONCLUSION(S): This accelerated multimodality treatment program is feasible and perioperative mortality proved acceptable. Despite excellent locoregional control, freedom from recurrence, and overall survival proved disappointing reflecting the frequency of distant metastases. Heterogeneity in patient populations makes comparisons with similar nonrandomized experiences problematic. © 2007 Lippincott Williams & Wilkins, Inc.",Excluded
761,"[Prospective double-blind study of prophylaxis of radioxerostomia with Coumarin/Troxerutine in patients with head and neck cancer]. AIM: Prospective, randomized placebo-controlled double-blind study to prove the efficacy of Coumarin/Troxerutine (Venalot Depot) for protection of salivary glands during a head and neck irradiation., PATIENTS AND METHOD: Forty-eight radiotherapy patients (60 Gy) with head and neck cancer were included in this trial. During radiotherapy the salivary glands were located in the core irradiation field. Primary efficacy parameters were sialometry, quantitative salivary gland scintigraphy and clinical evaluation of early effects of radiotherapy (RTOG-score, Table 1). All data were collected at 6 assessments: 1 week pre-radiation (U1), at start (U2), half time (U3) and end (U4) of irradiation, 8 days (U5) and 28 days (U6) after the end of irradiation (Figure 1)., RESULTS: Twenty-three patients (11 verum, 12 placebo) completed the study with all assessments. Sialometrically, all patients were severely (half of radiotherapy) or completely (end of radiotherapy) xerostomatic (Figure 2). In a global efficacy measure according to O'Brien combining scintigraphy and RTOG there was a tendency for a higher efficacy of verum compared to placebo (p = 0.068). After start of irradiation therapy, the RTOG-score showed continuously and significantly lower early radiation effects under verum than under placebo (U3 vs U6: p < 0.05, area under curve: p = 0.032; Table 2, Figure 3). The scintigraphically determined excretion fraction was slightly less impaired in the verum group compared to the placebo treatment (p = 0.12. Figure 4). There was no difference in drug safety between placebo and verum for adverse events, changes in the activity of liver enzymes and for global impression of tolerability., CONCLUSIONS: The results give support for an advantageous effect of Venalot Depot in the treatment of radiogenic sialadenitis and mucositis. In even a small number of evaluable patients, early clinical effects of irradiation (RTOG-score) were less pronounced in the active treatment group than in the placebo group, but the sample size was too low to prove statistically also the benefit of coumarin/troxerutine with the scintigraphic method. Sialometry seems not suitable for the assessment of early radiation effects.",Excluded
787,"Feasibility study of single agent cisplatin and concurrent radiotherapy in Japanese patients with squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck: Preliminary results. Background: Concurrent chemoradiotherapy with the single agent cisplatin (CDDP + RT) has been recognized worldwide as the standard treatment for unresectable locally advanced SCCHN. The objective of this study was to clarify the feasibility of CDDP + RT in Japanese patients. Patients and Methods: Patients with unresectable squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck were given single daily fractionated radiation (70 Gy at 2 Gy/day) and chemotherapy consisting of a 2 h infusion of CDDP 100 mg/m2 on days 1, 22 and 43. The primary endpoint was the rate of completion of CDDP + RT. Result(s): Between November 2005 and January 2007, 20 patients were enrolled, 19 males and one female with a median age of 61.5 years (range 50-74). One patient had recurrent unresectable disease after surgery and the remaining 19 had stage IV disease. No grade 4 hematologic toxicities were observed. The incidence of grade 3 mucositis was 55% and no treatment-related death occurred. Full-dose irradiation was performed in all patients, with a median duration of radiotherapy of 50 days (range 48-54). Although all patients received the first two administrations of CDDP, the third dose was administed in 17 patients (85%). The rate of completion of CDDP + RT was 85% and the dose intensity of CDDP was 28.9 mg/m2/week (relative dose intensity 89%). Overall complete response rate was 50% and the rate of primary complete response was 90%. Conclusion(s): Concurrent chemoradiation therapy with the standard dose ofCDDP is feasible in Japanese patients. Treatment modification based on racial differences is not necessary. © 2007 Foundation for Promotion of Cancer Research.",Excluded
2399,"The role of FDG-PET/CT in detection of gastric cancer recurrence. AIM: The purpose of this study was to retrospectively determine the efficacy and usefulness of 18F-fluoro-2-deoxyglucose positron emission tomography/computed tomography (FDG-PET/CT) in detecting and re-staging recurrent gastric cancer patients with clinical or radiological suspicion of recurrence. METHOD(S): This retrospective study has been conducted on 41 patients who were treated gastrectomy and postoperatively radiotherapy or/and chemotherapy. Histopathologic diagnosis revealed 2 signet ring cell carcinoma, and 39 adenocancer. All of the patients referred to our department for restaging due to clinical findings, tumor markers and/or radiologic suspicion of recurrence during follow-up.27 out of 41 were male and 14 female. The mean age was 58+/-10 years (range 30-75 years). FDG-PET/CT was applied twice to all patients. The first FDG- PET/CT was for staging and restaging. The second was for restaging due to clinical findings, tumor markers and/or radiologic suspicion of recurrence during follow-up. The standard of reference for tumor recurrence consisted of histopathologic confirmation or clinical follow-up information for at least 6 month after FDG-PET/CT examinations. RESULT(S): Cause of the first FDG-PET/CT application was due to staging in 24 patients and restaging in 17. FDG-PET/CT was negative in 14 patients and positive in 27. Out of 27, 7 patients had recurrence in gastric area, 7 patients had both recurrence and metastases and, 13 patients had metastases Histological verification was done in 11 patients who were re-operated after the first FDG-PET/CT. The second FDG-PET/CT application to 27 patients was for the assessment of the response to the treatment applied. 4 patients had full metabolic recovery, 11 had progression and 12 had regression. For 17 patients whose first FDG-PET/CT results were negative, the second FDG-PET/CT application was due to restaging for the suspicion of metastases in other radiologic modalities in 6 and high tumor marker levels in 8 patients. The results for the 17 patients were metastases in 5 and negative in 9 patients CONCLUSION(S): FDG-PET/CT is helpful in confirming the presence of recurrence particularly in patients who were highly suspicious of recurrence, because of its high positive predictability.",Excluded
2362,"A Novel Targeted Foraminoplasty Device Improves the Efficacy and Safety of Foraminoplasty in Percutaneous Endoscopic Lumbar Discectomy: Preliminary Clinical Application of 70 Cases. Objective: Percutaneous endoscopic lumbar discectomy (PELD) has become a mature and mainstream surgical technique for treating lumbar disc herniation (LDH); however, there is a steep learning curve with PELD, especially for puncture and foraminoplasty. In this study, we assessed the outcome and safety of a novel quantificational and targeted foraminoplasty device named ZESSYS for LDH. Method(s): From September to December of 2016, 70 patients with symptomatic LDH were enrolled in the study. The patients were assigned randomly to either the ZESSYS group or the conventional TESSYS group. We recorded the cannula introduction time, decompression time, radiation exposure time, intraoperative pain feeling score, visual analog scale, Oswestry Disability Index, and Macnab criteria score of the 2 groups. The mean follow-up period was 14 months. Result(s): The average cannula introduction time (16.50 +/- 3.29 minutes) and the radiation exposure time (40.71 +/- 6.23 seconds) in the ZESSYS group were significantly reduced compared with the TESSYS group (cannula introduction time, 20.06 +/- 3.37 minutes, P = 0.000; radiation exposure time, 49.20 +/- 7.84 seconds, P = 0.000). Intraoperative pain feeling score in the ZESSYS group was significantly improved compared with the TESSYS group (P = 0.021). There were no significant differences between the 2 groups for decompression time (P = 0.617), Macnab criteria (P = 0.769), or visual analog scale and Oswestry Disability Index scores at the same time point (P > 0.05). No serious complication was observed in any patients in either group. Conclusion(s): The novel targeted foraminoplasty technique with the specially designed double-cannulas is an effective and safe treatment for lumbar intervertebral disc herniation. It reduces the difficulty of PELD learning, minimizes radiation exposure, and decreases intraoperative pain associated with foraminoplasty.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.",Excluded
2898,"Stricture of the proximal esophagus in head and neck carcinoma patients after radiotherapy. BACKGROUND. It is well recognized that many patients with head and neck carcinoma have problems with food intake and malnutrition. The objective of the current study was to determine the clinical pattern of patients with nonneoplastic stricture of the upper esophagus after radiotherapy for head and neck carcinoma. METHODS. A retrospective chart study of 22 patients with stricture of the proximal esophagus diagnosed between 1993 and 1999 at Karolinska Hospital was performed. The dose volume histograms of the first 2 cm and 5 cm, respectively, of the proximal esophagus were calculated. RESULTS. Five of the patients (23%) had total obliteration. The first 2 cm of the esophagus received at least 60 grays (Gy) in > 80% of the volume. Radiation injury was not reported to occur at doses < 60 Gy. There was a correlation found between dysphagia during radiotherapy and the development of proximal esophageal stricture. Stricture was diagnosed 1-60 months (median, 6 months) after radiotherapy. In 18 patients, the stricture was treated with single or repeated endoscopic dilation. These treatments allowed a nearly normal diet in 78% of the patients. CONCLUSIONS. Stricture of the upper esophagus is one deglutition disorder that is reported to occur after radiotherapy for head and neck carcinoma. In the current study, the authors emphasize the importance of knowing the tolerance of the normal esophagus to irradiation as well as early diagnosis of stricture of the proximal esophagus because this condition may lead to physical and emotional distress. © 2003 American Cancer Society.",Excluded
3384,"DPYD, TYMS, TYMP, TK1, and TK2 genetic expressions as response markers in locally advanced rectal cancer patients treated with fluoropyrimidine-based chemoradiotherapy. This study is to investigate multiple chemotherapeutic agent- and radiation-related genetic biomarkers in locally advanced rectal cancer (LARC) patients following fluoropyrimidine-based concurrent chemoradiotherapy (CCRT) for response prediction. We initially selected 6 fluoropyrimidine metabolism-related genes (DPYD, ORPT, TYMS, TYMP, TK1, and TK2) and 3 radiotherapy response-related genes (GLUT1, HIF-1 alpha, and HIF-2 alpha) as targets for gene expression identification in 60 LARC cancer specimens. Subsequently, a high-sensitivity weighted enzymatic chip array was designed and constructed to predict responses following CCRT. After CCRT, 39 of 60 (65%) LARC patients were classified as responders (pathological tumor regression grade 2 ~ 4). Using a panel of multiple genetic biomarkers (chip), including DPYD, TYMS, TYMP, TK1, and TK2, at a cutoff value for 3 positive genes, a sensitivity of 89.7% and a specificity of 81% were obtained (AUC: 0.915; 95% CI: 0.840-0.991). Negative chip results were significantly correlated to poor CCRT responses (TRG 0-1) (P = 0.014, hazard ratio: 22.704, 95% CI: 3.055-235.448 in multivariate analysis). Disease-free survival analysis showed significantly better survival rate in patients with positive chip results (P = 0.0001). We suggest that a chip including DPYD, TYMS, TYMP, TK1, and TK2 genes is a potential tool to predict response in LARC following fluoropyrimidine-based CCRT. © 2013 Ming-Yii Huang et al.",Excluded
1348,"Lifelong hematopoiesis in both reconstituted and sublethally irradiated mice is provided by multiple sequentially recruited stem cells. Objective. To evaluate the dynamics of stem cell production to hematopoiesis, the number of active stem cell clones and the lifespan of individual clones were studied. Materials and Methods. The clonal contribution of primitive hematopoietic stem cells (HSC) responsible for long-term hematopoiesis was determined using two approaches. In one model, irradiated female mice were reconstituted with retrovirally marked male hematopoietic cells. In the second model, mice were irradiated sublethally without hematopoietic cell transplantation. In both models, bone marrow cells were serially sampled from the same mouse throughout a 12- to 20-month period and injected into irradiated recipients for analysis of day 10 colony-forming unit-spleen (CFU-S). The donor origin of CFU-S was determined by the presence of retrovirally marked cells or cells with chromosomal aberrations. Results. The results of the two essentially different models show that 1) hematopoiesis is mainly the product of small clones of hematopoietic cells; 2) the lifespan of the majority of clones is only 1 to 2 months; 3) the clones usually function locally; and 4) the vast majority of the clones replace one another sequentially. Primitive HSCs capable of producing long-lived clones (about 10% among all clones), which exist during the entire life of a mouse, were detected by the radiation-marker technique only. Conclusion. Multiple short-living clones (at least on the level of CFU-S production) comprise the vast majority of the active stem cells in transplanted recipients or after endogenous recovery from sublethal irradiation. © 2001 International Society for Experimental Hematology.",Excluded
1081,"Scanning beyond anatomic limits of the thorax in chest CT: findings, radiation dose, and automatic tube current modulation. OBJECTIVE: Our objective was to determine additional radiation dose associated with scanning beyond the anatomic limits of the thorax in chest CT protocol and to assess the effect of z-axis modulation on the additional radiation dose associated with the scanning protocol. MATERIALS AND METHODS: ""Extra"" images for routine chest CT were defined as those above lung apices (supraapical) and those caudal to the lowermost portion of lung parenchyma (infrapulmonary), including images obtained beyond the adrenal glands (infraadrenal). One hundred and forty-eight consecutive chest CT examinations (70 men, 78 women; age range, 15-90 years) performed September 13-25, 2003, were reviewed to determine the number of supraapical, infrapulmonary, and infraadrenal extra images. All examinations were performed using z-axis modulation (n = 70) or fixed tube current (n = 78). The CT dose index volume and dose-length product (DLP) values for the extra images were calculated. Two radiologists reviewed these extra images for pathologic findings. Student's t test was used to perform the statistical analysis. RESULT(S): One hundred forty-four (97%) examinations had supraapical extra images and 145 (98%) had infrapulmonary extra images. A total of 31 additional findings were observed in extra images. Most clinically important findings were identified in patients with a history of malignancy. With z-axis modulation, the mean DLP for supraapical and infrapulmonary extra images was 39.98 mGy x cm and 132.59 mGy x cm, respectively. With fixed tube current, the mean DLP for supraapical and infrapulmonary extra images was 30.31 mGy x cm and 95.91 mGy x cm, respectively. CONCLUSION(S): A substantial number of extra images are acquired during chest CT that do not add clinically important information in patients with nonmalignant indications. The use of z-axis modulation increased radiation dose for the extra images.",Excluded

OBJECTIVES: To investigate the role of third-generation iterative reconstruction (ADMIRE) in dual-source, high-pitch chest CT protocol with spectral shaping at 100 kVp in Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). METHOD(S): Confirmed COVID-19 inpatients undergoing to unenhanced chest CT were scanned with a dual-energy acquisition (DECT, 90/150Sn kV) and a dual-source, high-pitch acquisition with tin-filtered 100 kVp (LDCT). On the DECT with ADMIRE 3 (DECT3) were evaluated the pulmonary findings and their extension (25-point score). Two radiologists in consensus evaluated with 5-point scales the overall image quality, the anatomical structures, and the elementary findings on LDCT reconstructed with filtered backprojection (LDCT0), with ADMIRE 3 (LDCT3) and 5 (LDCT5), and on DECT3. The signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), the body mass index, the exposure times, and the radiation doses were recorded. RESULT(S): Seventy-five patients (57 M/18F; median age: 63 y.o.) were included, with median pulmonary extension of 13/25 points. The imaging findings were detected in proportion comparable to the available literature. The ADMIRE significantly improved the SNR in LDCT (p<0.00001) with almost no significant differences in overweight patients. The LDCT had median effective dose of 0.39 mSv and acquisition time of 0.71 s with significantly less motion artifacts than DECT (p<0.00001). The DECT3 and LDCT3 provided the best image quality and depiction of pulmonary anatomy and imaging findings, with significant differences among all the series (p<0.00001).

Background: CD4+ T cells DNA hypomethylation is involved in the pathogenesis of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). Recent studies showed that ultraviolet B (UVB, 290-320. nm) might induce the exacerbation of SLE by decreasing the DNA methylation level. However, the role of DNA methyltransferase 1 (DNMT1) in the UVB-induced CD4+ T cells DNA hypomethylation remains unclear. Objective(s): To elucidate the role of DNMT1 in lupus CD4+ T cells global DNA hypomethylation enhanced by UVB. Method(s): 35 SLE patients and 15 healthy controls were enrolled in the study. CD4+ T cells from SLE patients and healthy controls exposed to different dosages of UVB were analyzed. The global DNA methylation measurement, real-time PCR, Western blotting and DNMT1 catalytic activity detection were employed. Result(s): The level of global DNA methylation and DNMT1 mRNA expression in CD4+ T cells from SLE patients were significantly lower than those from the control group. DNA methylation was decreased after UVB exposure in a dosage-dependent manner in SLE patients, but not in the control group. DNMT1 mRNA and protein expression level were not affected by UVB exposure in both SLE patients and healthy controls. DNMT1 catalytic activity was significantly decreased in CD4+ T cells from SLE patients after UVB exposure in a dosage-dependent manner. DNMT1 catalytic activity was lower and more sensitive to UVB exposure in CD4+ T cells from active SLE patients that from stable ones.

1329,"Assessment of the degradation rates and effectiveness of different coated Mg-Zn-Ca alloy scaffolds for in vivo repair of critical-size bone defects. Surgical repair of bone defects remains challenging, and the search for alternative procedures is ongoing. Devices made of Mg for bone repair have received much attention owing to their good biocompatibility and mechanical properties. We developed a new type of scaffold made of a Mg-Zn-Ca alloy with a shape that mimics cortical bone and can be filled with morselized bone. We evaluated its durability and efficacy in a rabbit ulna-defect model. Three types of scaffold-surface coating were evaluated: group A, no coating; group B, a 10-mum microarc oxidation coating; group C, a hydrothermal duplex composite coating; and group D, an empty-defect control. X-ray and micro-computed tomography(micro-CT) images were acquired over 12 weeks to assess ulnar repair. A mechanical stress test indicated that bone repair within each group improved significantly over time (P < 0.01). The degradation behavior of the different scaffolds was assessed by micro-CT and quantified according to the amount of hydrogen gas generated; these measurements indicated that the group C scaffold better resisted corrosion than did the other scaffold types (P < 0.05). Calcein fluorescence and histology revealed that greater mineral densities and better bone responses were achieved for groups B and C than for group A, with group C providing the best response. In conclusion, our Mg-Zn-Ca-alloy scaffold effectively aided bone repair. The group C scaffold exhibited the best corrosion resistance and osteogenesis properties, making it a candidate scaffold for repair of bone defects.",Excluded
3544,"Low-dose multidetector-row CT-angiography of abdominal aortic aneurysm after endovascular repair. PURPOSE: To investigate the possibility of reducing radiation dose exposure while maintaining image quality using multidetector computed tomography angiography (MDCTA) with high-concentration contrast media in patients undergoing follow-up after endovascular aortic repair (EVAR) to treat abdominal aortic aneurysm., MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this prospective, single center, intra-individual study, patients underwent two consecutive MDCTA scans 6 months apart, one with a standard acquisition protocol (130 mAs/120 kV) and 120 mL of iomeprol 300, and one using a low dose protocol (100 mAs/80 kV) and 90 mL of iomeprol 400. Images acquired during the arterial phase of contrast enhancement were evaluated both qualitatively and quantitatively for image noise and intraluminal contrast enhancement., RESULTS: Thirty adult patients were prospectively enrolled. Statistically significantly higher attenuation values were measured in the low-dose acquisition protocol compared to the standard protocol, from the suprarenal abdominal aorta to the common femoral artery (p<0.0001; all vascular segments). Qualitatively, image quality was judged significantly (p=0.0002) better with the standard protocol than with the low-dose protocol. However, no significant differences were found between the two protocols in terms of contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR) (13.63+/-6.97 vs. 11.48+/-8.13; p=0.1058). An overall dose reduction of up to 74% was observed for the low-dose protocol compared with the standard protocol., CONCLUSION: In repeat follow-up examinations of patients undergoing EVAR for abdominal aortic aneurysm, a low-dose radiation exposure acquisition protocol provides substantially reduced radiation exposure while maintaining a constant CNR and good image quality.

2886,"Radiation exposure associated with dedicated renal mass computed tomography protocol: impact of patient characteristics. BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Renal mass protocol CT (RMP-CT) using multiphase abdomen and pelvis CT imaging is the mainstay for diagnosis, characterization, and follow-up for renal masses; however, it is associated with ionizing radiation to the patient. We sought to quantify the effective dose associated with RMP-CT and to determine how patient factors affect radiation exposure., MATERIAL AND METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed the records of 247 patients undergoing management of a small renal mass (cT1a) between 2005 and 2011 at our institution. Body mass index (BMI) was categorized as normal weight, overweight, obese, and morbidly obese (<=25, 25.1-30, 30.1-35 and >35, respectively). Effective dose of RMP-CT was calculated through the dose-length-product multiplied by a factor coefficient (0.015). Effective doses in milliSieverts (mSv) were correlated to patient characteristics., RESULTS: Patients' median age was 61 years, and median BMI was 28.7 kg/m(2); 72% were Caucasian and 56% were male. Median effective dose was 26.1 mSv (interquartile range 20.6-35.3). When stratified by BMI, the median effective doses were 18.9, 25.2, 27.7, and 36.2mSv for normal weight, overweight, obese, and morbidly obese patients, respectively. On multivariable analyses, BMI and male sex were significantly associated with increased radiation dose., CONCLUSIONS: In this series, the median effective dose for RMP-CT was 26.1 mSv. Obesity was independently associated with markedly increased radiation exposure, with morbidly obese patients being exposed to almost twice the amount of radiation compared with normal weight persons. These findings should be considered when devising management strategies in patients with a renal mass and strategies should be developed to reduce medical ionizing radiation exposure.",Excluded
444,"Long-term outcomes of combined endoscopic resection and chemoradiotherapy for esophageal squamous cell carcinoma with submucosal invasion. Background: For esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) with submucosal (SM) invasion, surgery is the standard treatment. Definitive chemoradiotherapy (D-CRT) is a less invasive alternative option, but sometimes results in locoregional failure. Aim(s): To examine whether endoscopic resection for primary lesion removal combined with chemoradiotherapy (ER-CRT) reduces locoregional failure rates in cases of ESCC with SM invasion. Method(s): We retrospectively compared clinical outcomes between ER-CRT and D-CRT in patients diagnosed with ESCC with SM invasion between 2003 and 2014. Twenty-one patients underwent ER-CRT based on a pathological diagnosis, and 43 patients underwent D-CRT based on a clinical diagnosis. Result(s): Locoregional failure developed in 26% of patients in the D-CRT group, and in no patients in the ER-CRT group (p < 0.01). Thus, the 5-year relapse-free survival in the ER-CRT group was significantly more favorable than that in the D-CRT group (85.1% vs 59.2%; p < 0.05), although there was no difference in overall survival (85.1% vs 79.1%) nor in cause-specific survival (90.5% vs 87.2%) between the groups. There were no instances of perforation or hemorrhage associated with ER. Conclusion(s): ER-CRT is a safe and effective treatment strategy and can be considered as a new minimally invasive treatment option for patients with ESCC with SM invasion.Copyright © 2018 Editrice Gastroenterologica Italiana S.r.l.",Excluded
841,"Prognostic and Treatment Guiding Significance of MRI-Based Tumor Burden Features and Nodal Necrosis in Nasopharyngeal Carcinoma. We aimed to develop a nomogram integrating MRI-based tumor burden features (MTBF), nodal necrosis, and some clinical factors to forecast the distant metastasis-free survival (DMFS) of patients suffering from non-metastatic nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC). A total of 1640 patients treated at Sun Yat-sen University Cancer Center (Guangzhou, China) from 2011 to 2016 were enrolled, among which 1148 and 492 patients were randomized to a training cohort and an internal validation cohort, respectively. Additionally, 200 and 257 patients were enrolled in the Foshan and Dongguan validation cohorts, respectively, which served as independent external validation cohorts. The MTBF were developed from the stepwise regression of six multidimensional tumor burden variables, based on which we developed a nomogram also integrating nodal necrosis and clinical features. This model divided the patients into high- and low-risk groups by an optimal cutoff. Compared with those of patients in the low-risk group, the DMFS [hazard ratio (HR): 4.76, 95% confidence interval (CI): 3.39-6.69; p < 0.0001], and progression-free survival (PFS; HR: 4.11, 95% CI: 3.13-5.39; p < 0.0001) of patients in the high-risk group were relatively poor. Furthermore, in the training cohort, the 3-year DMFS of high-risk patients who received induction chemotherapy (ICT) combined with concurrent chemoradiotherapy (CCRT) was better than that of those who were treated with CCRT alone (p = 0.0340), whereas low-risk patients who received ICT + CCRT had a similar DMFS to those who only received CCRT. The outcomes we obtained were all verified in the three validation cohorts. The survival model can be used as a reliable prognostic tool for NPC patients and is helpful to determine patients who will benefit from ICT.© Copyright © 2020 Chen, Cao, Jing, Xia, Ke, Xiang, Liu, Qiang, Liang, Li, Gao, Li, Miao, Liu, Cai, Lv, Guo, Li and Lv.",Excluded
3029,"Management of oropharyngeal cancer: a cross-sectional review of institutional practice at a large Canadian referral centre. BACKGROUND: Over the years, the treatment of oropharyngeal cancer has changed; in the past, first-line treatment consisted of surgery followed by adjuvant radiotherapy, today however, primary treatment typically involves concomitant chemoradiation, and reserves surgery for salvage. While chemoradiation is the modality of choice for primary management of oropharyngeal cancer, disease characteristics, institutional bias, and patient preferences influence treatment choice. This has lead to variation in the treatment of OPC, and has generated some uncertainly regarding the ideal therapeutic approach. The objective of this study was to describe the treatment of OPC a large Canadian referral center, highlighting trends in treatment choice and outcome., METHODS: This is a cross-sectional retrospective review of clinical practice at Sunnybrook Health Science Centre (Toronto, ON). This investigation documents type of first-line treatment, rates of treatment failure, rates of surgical salvage, and 5-year disease-free survival. This study also asses the therapeutic impact of free-flap reconstruction on the use of a postoperative tracheostomy and/or percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy tube., RESULTS: The majority of oropharyngeal cancer patients presented with regionally metastatic disease (stage III-IV) and underwent concomitant chemoradiation as first-line treatment. Just over half of patients who failed chemoradiation were eligible for salvage surgery. Forty-six percent of salvage patients recurred at approximately 6 months, and died approximately 12 months following the first sign of disease recurrence. Five-year survival for salvage patients stage II, III, IVA, and IVB was 100%, 54.5%, 53.8%, and 50%, respectively. The incidence of percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy tubes and tracheostomies was comparable between patients who underwent free-flap reconstruction and patients who did not., CONCLUSION: The modality of choice for first-line treatment of oropharyngeal cancer is concomitant chemoradiation. The moderate failure rate following chemoradiation and the modest survival rate following salvage surgery could indicate that selected patients may benefit from undergoing surgery as first-line treatment. While this study did not show that functional outcomes were better for free-flap patients, it is highly likely that those who received a free-flap did better then they would have had they not undergone reconstructive surgery. More research regarding the therapeutic effects of free-flaps in OPC survivors is needed.",Excluded
2529,"Statistical analysis of Japanese Thorotrast-administered autopsy cases--1980. In 193 cases autopsied between 1945 and 1980, all persons who had been intravascularly injected with Thorotrast in life, the authors found 131 malignant hepatic tumors, 20 liver cirrhoses, 6 myeloid leukemias, 4 erythroleukemias, 5 aplastic anemias, 4 lung cancers, 1 mesothelioma and 1 osteosarcoma. The causes of death in the Thorotrast-administered autopsy group (193 cases) were compared with those of a non-Thorotrast-administered autopsy group (95,000 cases) of the same sex and age at death as recorded in the Annals of Japanese Pathological Autopsy cases from 1958 to 1978.

2144,"Dramatic and prolonged decrease of whole salivary secretion in nasopharyngeal carcinoma patients treated with radiotherapy. Objectives. This study evaluates: (1) the change in whole salivary secretion rates of nasopharyngeal carcinoma patients before, during, and after radiotherapy, especially during the first week of irradiation; (2) the recovery capability of salivary glands up to 2 years postirradiation; and (3) the possible prognostic factors affecting salivary gland functions. Study design. Fifty patients who completed conventional radiotherapy using either once-per-day or hyperfractionated technique were included. Both unstimulated and stimulated whole salivary flow rates and ratios (flow rate compared with baseline) were measured before, during, 1, 3, and 6 months, and 1 and 2 years after radiotherapy. Multivariate analysis of potential prognostic factors affecting the salivary secretion ratio was made. Results. Salivary glands were very radiosensitive and responded to radiation very early. After 720 cGy at the fourth day of the 8-week treatment, the unstimulated and stimulated salivary flow rates had decreased by 40%-50%. The nadir was reached in many patients after 3600 cGy (4 weeks). A second phase of decrease in salivary secretion was noted after completion of radiotherapy. Conclusions. Different mechanisms may be responsible for salivary response after low and high dose of radiation. This study shows no recovery of salivary secretion during the follow-up period, and the best strategy for managing radiation-induced salivary gland damage may be reduction of radiation dose to the glands. © 2006 Elsevier Inc.

We studied the relative etiologic importance upon the development of Parkinson's disease (PD) of occupational exposure to herbicides and other compounds, ionizing radiation exposure, family history of PD and essential tremor, smoking, and history of various viral and other medical conditions. We identified patients (n = 130) with neurologist-confirmed idiopathic PD through contacts with Calgary general hospitals, long-term care facilities, neurologists, the Movement Disorder Clinic, and the Parkinson's Society of Southern Alberta, and selected two matched (by sex and age +/- 2.5 years) community controls for each case by random digit dialing. We obtained lifetime work, chemical, radiation, medical, and smoking exposure histories and family histories of PD and essential tremor by personal interviews, and analyzed the data using conditional logistic regression for matched sets. After controlling for potential confounding and interaction between the exposure variables, using multivariate statistical methods, having a family history of PD was the strongest predictor of PD risk, followed by head trauma and then occupational herbicide use. Cases and controls did not differ in their previous exposures to smoking or ionizing radiation; family history of essential tremor; work-related contact with aluminum, carbon monoxide, cyanide, manganese, mercury, or mineral oils; or history of arteriosclerosis, chicken pox, encephalitis, hypertension, hypotension, measles, mumps, rubella, or Spanish flu. These results support the hypothesis of a multifactorial etiology for PD, probably involving genetic, environmental, trauma, and possibly other factors.",Excluded
3163,"Prognostic significance of pre-treatment neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) in patients with oropharyngeal cancer treated with radiotherapy. Background: This study aimed to evaluate the prognostic value of pre-treatment NLR in patients with oropharyngeal cancer. Method(s): Patients who completed definitive radiotherapy (RT) for oropharyngeal cancer and had blood counts taken pre-RT from 2002 to 2013 were included. NLR was calculated as total neutrophil/lymphocytes. Survival rates were estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method. Univariable and multivariable analyses were conducted with linear and Cox regression methods. NLR was analysed posteriori and dichotomised on the discovered median. Result(s): Eight hundred and forty-eight patients were analysed. The median pre-RT NLR was 3. Patients with NLR of <3 had improved overall survival (OS) than those with NLR >= 3 (5-year OS 85 vs 74%, p < 0.0001). OS differences remained significant when stratified according to HPV status (HPV-positive p = 0.011; HPV-negative p = 0.003). Freedom from any recurrence (FFR), locoregional control (LRC) and freedom of distant recurrence (FDR) were better in those with NLR < 3. The negative impact of elevated pre-RT NLR on OS (HR = 1.64, p = 0.001), FFR (HR = 1.6, p = 0.006) and LRC (HR = 1.8, p = 0.005) remained significant on multivariable analysis. Conclusion(s): Pre-RT NLR is an independent prognostic factor in patients with oropharyngeal cancer regardless of HPV status. Patients with lower NLR had more favourable OS and disease control.Copyright © 2020, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Cancer Research UK.",Excluded

OBJECTIVE: To quantify the effective radiation dose associated with the evaluation and follow-up of patients with urolithiasis., METHODS: Retrospective review was performed for consecutive patients presenting to a tertiary stone clinic with acute stone episodes between November 2007 and December 2008, and had at least 2 years of follow-up. Number and modality of imaging studies were collected. Effective radiation exposure (ERE) doses were calculated from the dose length product values reported with each computed tomography (CT) scan., RESULTS: There were 72 males and 32 females with a mean age of 49 years (range 21-78). Patients underwent an average 1.8 (range 0-5) and 0.7 (range 0-2) plain radiographs, 0.82 (range 0-4) and 0.15 (range 0-2) CTs, 0.09 (range 0-1) and 0.03 (range 0-1) intravenous urograms, and 0.3 (range 0-1) and 0.6 (range 0-2) ultrasounds (US) during the first and second years, respectively (all P<.05). The average calculated ERE dose per CT scan was 23.16 mSv (range 4.94-72.77). The calculated mean ERE dose per patient significantly decreased from 29.29 mSv (range 1.7-77.27) in the first year to 8.04 mSv (range 1.4-24.72) in the second year (P<.01). This was because of significantly fewer CT scans and significantly more US imaging during the second year (P<.05). Although 18 (17.3%) patients exceeded 50 mSv during the first year, none exceeded this threshold during the second year. The mean ERE dose did not correlate with stone location, patient age, and sex., CONCLUSION: The calculated mean ERE dose significantly decreased during the second year of follow-up in patients with urolithiasis because of significantly higher use of US.

1182,"Evaluation of [18F]Mefway biodistribution and dosimetry based on whole-body PET imaging of mice. PURPOSE: [(18)F]Mefway is a novel radiotracer specific to the serotonin 5-HT1A receptor class. In preparation for using this tracer in humans, we have performed whole-body PET studies in mice to evaluate the biodistribution and dosimetry of [(18)F]Mefway.
METHODS: Six mice (three females and three males) received IV injections of [(18)F]Mefway and were scanned for 2 h in an Inveon-dedicated PET scanner. Each animal also received a high-resolution CT scan using an Inveon CT. The CT images were used to draw volume of interest on the following organs: the brain, large intestine, stomach, heart, kidneys, liver, lungs, pancreas, bone, spleen, testes, thymus, gallbladder, uterus, and urinary bladder. All organ time-activity curves without decay correction were normalized to the injected activity. The area under the normalized curves was then used to compute the residence times in each organ. Data were analyzed using PMOD and Matlab software. The absorbed doses in mouse organs were computed using the RAdiation Dose Assessment Resource animal models for dose assessment. The residence times in mouse organs were converted to human values using scale factors based on differences between organ and body weights. OLINDA/EXM 1.1 software was used to compute the absorbed human doses in multiple organs for both female and male phantoms.
RESULTS: The highest mouse residence times were found in the liver, urinary bladder, and kidneys. The largest doses in mice were found in the urinary bladder (critical organ), kidney, and liver for both females and males, indicating primary elimination via urinary system. The projected human effective doses were 1.21E - 02 mSv/MBq for the adult female model and 1.13E - 02 mSv/MBq for the adult male model. The estimated human biodistribution of [(18)F]Mefway was similar to that of [(11)C]WAY 100,635, a 5-HT1A tracer for which dosimetry has been evaluated in humans.
CONCLUSIONS: The elimination of radiotracer was primarily via the kidney and urinary bladder with the urinary bladder being the critical organ. Whole-body mouse imaging can be used as a preclinical tool to provide initial estimates of the absorbed doses of [(18)F]Mefway in humans.",Excluded

With the purpose of avoiding an eventual radiation exposure of the lung, or at least of confining it to a minimum, only limited quantities not exceeding 3.5 ml (5 mCi of 32P; 0.5 mCi of 131I) of the oily contrast medium for unilateral, or twice 3.5 ml (together 4 mCi of 32P; 0.5 mCi of 131I) for bilateral application. A retrospective analysis of 245 patients of the study group for endolymphatic radionuclide therapy, who suffered from malignant melanomas of the inferior limbs, revealed 77.5% of correct diagnoses. Most of the false-positive findings (44/70) seem to be due to the knowledge of the primary disease, as 77% of these cases had been described as ""suspicious"".

768,"Evaluation and management of pericardial effusion in patients with neoplastic disease. The incidence and extent of pericardial involvement in neoplastic disease varies. In a considerable number of patients with breast or lung cancer or with mediastinal lymphoma, in addition to direct involvement by the tumor, radiation therapy as well as systemic tumor treatment can also lead to pericardial effusion. In addition, in immunosuppressed tumor patients, pericardial effusion can also arise from viral, bacterial, and autoimmune causes. To distinguish between these 3 different conditions leading to pericardial effusion, the diagnosis should be based on pericardiocentesis followed by fluid analysis for cytology and biomarkers, on epicardial and pericardial biopsy facilitated by flexible pericardioscopy with analysis of specimens by conventional histology and molecular biology techniques for viral and microbial aetiology. We collected prospectively but analyzed retrospectively 357 patients undergoing pericardiocentesis from 1988 to 2008 and identified 68 patients who had cancer-related pericardial effusion. With these methods, 42 patients demonstrated malignant effusion, 15 patients had radiation-induced pericardial, effusion, and in 11 patients without radiation therapy, the effusion could be attributed to either viral infection in 5 cases or to an autoimmune process in the remaining 6 patients. Consequently, intrapericardial treatment could be tailored for each cohort: neoplastic effusion was treated with intrapericardial cisplatin (single instillation of 30 mg/m(2) per 24 hours); in addition to the tumor-specific systemic chemotherapy, intrapericardial triamcinolone acetate (Volon A) was given in a dose of 500 mg/m(2) in the patients with autoimmune and radiation-induced effusion. Saline rinsing and intrapericardial sclerosing treatment were the treatment of choice in viral pericardial effusion. Oral colchicine treatment (2-3 x 0.5 mg) was given in all patients for at least 3 months. Recurrence of pericardial effusion was prevented for at least 3 months in more than 85% of patients.

RESULT(S): A population of 135 patients (90 M/45 F, sex-ratio 2) with a 53.5 mean age (19 to 75) is analyzed. Clinical palpable nodes were present in 68 cases (50%) mainly submental-submaxillar (54). Histologic examination showed a node involvement in 54 cases without (32 cases) or with capsular rupture (22 cases) mainly in the jugulo-carotidian chain (46/54). Among the 67 clinically N0 patients collected after 1990, 22 patients (33%) exhibited an histological involvement vs 32/68 (47%) for the group presenting palpable cervical nodes for the whole period. Histologic node involvement seemed to be linked to the clinical status, node size and TNM stage. CONCLUSION(S): Cervical lymph node treatment needs to be systematic in mobile tongue carcinoma. The probability of histologic involvement is linked to the loco-regional extent of disease and influences the prognosis. In N0 patients, neck dissection is required because of the frequency of histological involvement, particularly when loss to follow-up may be expected.",Excluded
360,"A role for neutrophil elastase in the progression of solar elastosis. Hairless (SKH-1) mice were mated with Beige (C57B/bb) mice to produce a hairless mouse deficient in neutrophil elastase (hhbb). These mice were exposed to 0.09J UVB irradiation for 5 months to see if neutrophil elastase was an important factor in elastin remodeling and development of solar elastoses. Analysis of peritoneal neutrophils confirmed that the hhbb mouse was deficient in elastase, retaining only 10% as much activity as the normal littermates (hhHb). Skin MPO activity was equally elevated in all the mice receiving UVB suggesting an equal influx of inflammatory cells. The absolute breaking strength of the skin in both the hhBb and hhbb mice was not altered by UVB treatment over the 5 month exposure period. Elastin quantitated biochemically as desmosine, or visualized histologically, was increased following UVB exposure in the normal mice. In the elastase deficient mice, however, the elastin fibers appeared to be unaffected by exposure to UVB irradiation at this level. The results suggest that neutrophil elastase is an important mediator in the development of solar elastosis resulting from continued exposure to UVB irradiation.",Excluded

2702,"Prognostic factors in metastatic nasopharyngeal carcinoma. Introduction: Nasopharyngeal carcinoma has the highest metastatic potential of all head and neck cancers. The survival time of patients with nasopharyngeal carcinoma has improved significantly in the last decades due to the use of combination of chemotherapy and radiotherapy, as well as advances in radiotherapy techniques. However, appropriately 30% of patients with nasopharyngeal carcinoma suffer a poor prognosis, mainly due to distant metastasis. Objective(s): The study aimed to identify the survival and prognostic factors in metastatic nasopharyngeal carcinoma. Method(s): A retrospective analysis was conducted in patients treated for synchronous metastatic nasopharyngeal carcinoma or metachronous metastatic nasopharyngeal carcinoma for 14 years (2003-2016). Overall survival was analyzed using the Kaplan-Meier method and compared using the log-rank test for the whole population and both groups of patients. Multivariate analysis was performed using the Cox model; p-values < 0.05 were considered to indicate statistical significance. Result(s): One hundred and twelve patients with metastatic nasopharyngeal carcinoma were included (51 patients with metastatic nasopharyngeal carcinoma, and 61 patients with metachronous metastatic nasopharyngeal carcinoma). In the whole population, the median overall survival was 10 months (1-156 months). In the multivariate analysis, female gender, poor performance status (WHO > 1) and metachronous metastasis were independent prognostic factors. In the metastatic nasopharyngeal carcinoma patients, the median overall survival was 13 months (1-156 months). In multivariate analysis, independent prognostic factors were non-oligometastatic disease, severe (G3-G4) chemotherapy toxicity and the lack of nasopharyngeal and metastatic site irradiation. In the metachronous metastatic nasopharyngeal carcinoma patients, the median overall survival was 7 months (1-41 months). In multivariate analysis, the poor performance status (WHO > 1) was an independent metastatic nasopharyngeal carcinoma prognostic factor. Conclusion(s): Oligometastatic patients with synchronous metastatic nasopharyngeal carcinoma had better survival. The locoregional treatment of primitive nasopharyngeal carcinoma improved survival in patients with metastatic nasopharyngeal carcinoma who responded to induction chemotherapy. Local irradiation of metastatic sites improved survival of metastatic nasopharyngeal carcinoma patients. Grade 3 or 4 chemotherapy toxicity altered survival among patients with synchronous metastatic nasopharyngeal carcinoma.Copyright © 2020 Associacao Brasileira de Otorrinolaringologia e Cirurgia Cervico-Facial",Excluded

PURPOSE: To assess the effect of positron emission tomography (PET) with fluorine-18 fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) on the treatment of patients with cutaneous malignant melanoma., MATERIALS AND METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed the medical records of 38 patients with newly diagnosed (n = 25) and recurrent (n = 13) cutaneous melanoma who were referred for evaluation with FDG PET imaging at our institution. We compared the PET findings with computed tomography (CT), which was available in 21 (55%) patients, and tabulated the changes in the diagnostic evaluation and therapeutic management that were prompted by PET during a follow-up period of 10 to 36 months., RESULTS: Compared with PET, the extent of disease was underestimated by CT in 5 (13%) patients. Planned surgical resection of metastases was canceled in two of these patients. In another patient, surveillance PET detected an unsuspected hypermetabolic abdominal mass that was noted on a subsequent CT to arise from the small bowel. The mass was found to be jejunal metastatic melanoma at the time of resection.

The best model of vascular catheter-related bloodstream infection was the ARIMA (0,0,1) model, with a residual Ljuing-Box Q test result of Q=14.914 (P=0.602). These results suggest that it is a white noise sequence, and its simulation and prediction effects are sufficient. The optimal model of urinary tract intubation-related urinary tract infection is ARIMA (1,0,0), and the residual Ljuing-Box Q test result is Q=15.042 (P=0.592), suggesting it is a white noise sequence with an accurate simulation and prediction effect. Conclusion(s): The ARIMA model can accurately simulate and predict nosocomial infection incidence rate in the Department of Critical Care Medicine of Guizhou Province, and can provide a reference for the prevention and control of nosocomial infections.Copyright © Annals of Translational Medicine.

1983,"Repeated ultraviolet exposure affords the same protection against DNA photodamage and erythema in human skin types II and IV but is associated with faster DNA repair in skin type IV. We have investigated the photoprotective properties of induced pigmentation using erythema and epidermal DNA photodamage as endpoints. Previously unexposed buttock skin of 12 young, healthy adults (six skin type II and six skin type IV) was exposed daily (Monday to Friday) for 2 wk (days 1-12) with 0.65 minimal erythema dose of solar simulated radiation. Mean skin type IV minimal erythema dose was 1.8-fold greater than for skin type II. Compared to skin type II, solar simulated radiation treatments produced less erythema and more tanning in skin type IV. To assess DNA photodamage, biopsies were taken and prepared for paraffin sections that were stained with a monoclonal antibody for thymine dimers. Thymine dimers were quantified by image analysis. The single exposure data (0.65 and 2 minimal erythema dose) showed that DNA damage was related to physical dose (J per cm2) independent of skin type. Our data also showed that DNA photo-damage accumulates in both skin types with repeated, suberythemal doses of solar simulated radiation. On day 12, there were more thymine dimers in skin type IV than skin type II, again indicating that physical rather than biologic dose determines the level of DNA damage. Comparisons on days 12 and 19, however, showed a much greater loss of thymine dimers in skin type IV, suggesting better thymine dimer repair. Protection factors for erythema and thymine dimers were calculated and shown to be about 2 in both skin types. This provides further indirect evidence that DNA is a chromophore for erythema, but also suggests that a tan may not be the major factor in natural photoprotection.",Excluded
2877,"Distal radius morphometry of Indonesian population. Background: Distal radius morphometry (radial inclination, palmar tilt, radial height, and ulnar variance) is an important parameter in the evaluation and treatment of distal radius fractures in which anatomical alignment must be corrected. Currently, treatment of distal radius fractures in Indonesia is still based on morphometry of western population or from the contralateral side. The aim of this study is to determine distal radius morphometry of Indonesian population and to compare between right and left side, male and female gender. Method(s): Distal radius morphometry was measured from 400 plain X-ray of right and left wrist AP and lateral projection. Samples were taken consecutively in Moh. Ridwan Meuraksa Army Hospital, Jakarta, from June to September 2010. Radial inclination, palmar tilt, radial height, and ulnar variance was measured. Data were recorded using tables and grouped between male and female, right and left side, statistical analysis was performed using Mann-Whitney test. Result(s): From 400 plain X-ray evaluated, there were 300 males and 100 females with the mean age of 25.5 years old (18-48). The mean of radial inclination was 23.99 +/- 3.75degree, palmar tilt 13.76 +/- 4.36degree, radial height 11.31 +/- 1.66 mm, and ulnar variance -0.45 +/- 2.03 mm. There were statistically significant differences between right and left side of radial inclination, palmar tilt, radial height, and ulnar variance. There was also statistically significant difference between male and female. Conclusion(s): Distal radius morphometry of Indonesian population may provide valuable data for the treatment of distal radius fractures. The use of contralateral side as reference should be reconsidered.Copyright © 2013, Faculty of Medicine, Universitas Indonesia. All rights reserved.",Excluded
2564,"Stereotactic body radiation therapy for post-pulmonary lobectomy isolated lung metastasis of thoracic tumor: Survival and side effects. Background: Stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) has emerged as an alternative treatment for patients with early stage non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) or metastatic pulmonary tumors. However, for isolated lung metastasis (ILM) of thoracic malignances after pulmonary lobectomy, reported outcomes of SBRT have been limited. This study evaluates the role of SBRT in the treatment of such patients. Method(s): A retrospective search of the SBRT database was conducted in three hospitals. The parameters analyzed in the treated patients were local control, progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS), and the treatment-related side-effects. Result(s): In total, 23 patients with single ILM after pulmonary lobectomy treated with SBRT were identified and the median follow-up time was 14 months (range: 6.0-47.0 months). Local recurrences were observed in two patients during follow-up and the 1-year local control rate was 91.3%. Median PFS and OS for the studied cohort were 10.0 months [95% confidence interval (CI) 5.1-14.9 months] and 21.0 months (95% CI 11.4-30.6 months), respectively. Acute radiation pneumonitis (RP) of grade 2 or worse was observed in five (21.7%) and three (13.0%) patients, respectively. Other treatment-related toxicities included chest wall pain in one patient (4.3%) and acute esophagitis in two patients (8.7%). By Pearson correlation analysis, the planning target volume (PTV) volume and the volume of the ipsilateral lung exposed to a minimum dose of 5 Gy (IpV5) were significantly related to the acute RP of grade 2 or worse in present study (p < 0.05). The optimal thresholds of the PTV and IpV5 to predict RP of acute grade 2 or worse RP were 59 cm3 and 51% respectively, according to the receiver-operating characteristics curve analysis, with sensitivity/specificity of 75.0%/80.0% and 62.5%/80.0%. Conclusion(s): SBRT for post-lobectomy ILM was effective and well tolerated. The major reason for disease progression was distant failure but not local recurrence. The PTV and IpV5 are potential predictors of acute RP of grade 2 or higher and should be considered in treatment planning for such patients.Copyright © 2014 Xiong et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",Excluded
1371,"Perioperative Comparison of Robotic-Assisted Versus Fluoroscopically Guided Minimally Invasive Transforaminal Lumbar Interbody Fusion. Objective: Robotic surgical systems have been developed to improve spine surgery accuracy. Studies have found significant reductions in screw revision rates and radiation exposure with robotic assistance compared with open surgery. The aim of the present study was to compare the perioperative outcomes between robot-assisted (RA) and fluoroscopically guided (FG) minimally invasive (MI) transforaminal lumbar interbody fusion (TLIF) performed by a single surgeon. Method(s): The present retrospective cohort study analyzed all patients with lumbar degenerative disease who had undergone MI-TLIF by a single surgeon from July 2017 to March 2020. One group had undergone FG MI-TLIF and one group had undergone RA MI-TLIF. Result(s): Of the 101 patients included in the present study, 52 had undergone RA MI-TLIF and 49, FG MI-TLIF. We found no statistically significant differences in the operative time (RA, 241 +/- 69.3 minutes; FG, 246.2 +/- 56.3 minutes; P = 0.681). The mean radiation time for the RA group was 32.8 +/- 28.8 seconds, and the mean fluoroscopy dose was 31.5 +/- 30 mGy. The RA radiation exposure data were compared with similar data for the FG MI-TLIF group in a previous study (59.5 +/- 60.4 mGy), with our patients' radiation exposure significantly lower (P = 0.035). The postoperative complications and rates of surgical revision were comparable. Conclusion(s): Our results have demonstrated that RA MI-TLIF provides perioperative outcomes comparable to those with FG MI-TLIF. A reduced radiation dose to the patient was observed with RA compared with FG MI-TLIF. No differences were noted between the RA and FG cohorts in operative times, complication rates, revision rates, or length of stay.Copyright © 2021",Excluded
1584,"Infratentorial craniospinal irradiation for von Hippel-Lindau: A retrospective study supporting a new treatment for patients with CNS hemangioblastomas. Patients with von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) syndrome with diffuse CNS hemangioblastomas have morbidity related to their disease and require a lifetime of surgical resections. Ninety-seven percent of tumors progress, and 5-year surgery rates are 20%-60%. Stereotactic radiosurgery and fractionated radiotherapy have had limited success. For the first time, we have used infratentorial craniospinal radiation therapy (ICSRT) for VHL patients with CNS hemangioblastomas. Consecutive VHL patients treated at the National Institutes of Health with radiographic evidence of hemangioblastomas were included if they received ICSRT. Patients underwent neurologic examinations and imaging at 3- to 12-month intervals. Seven patients with 84 hemangioblastomas met eligibility criteria. ICSRT was commonly administered to 43.2 Gy in 24 fractions. Mean pre-ICSRT tumor volume was 5.48 cm3. At a mean follow-up of 73.8 months, mean post-ICSRT tumor volume was 6.87 cm3, and 91 tumors were identified. Complete radiographic resolution was achieved in 17.9% of lesions. Although many patients were no longer optimal surgical candidates, only 4 surgeries were needed for symptomatic lesions after ICSRT, compared with 33 prior. Acute toxicity was mild and no patient developed grade >=1 late spinal cord toxicity according to the criteria of the Radiation Therapy Oncology Group/European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer, despite the high dose that the entire spinal cord received. Clinical and radiographic stability or resolution was demonstrated in the majority of tumors. Tumor growth rate in this study was less than reported in natural history studies, and the rate of surgical intervention was reduced. ICSRT was well tolerated, can decrease hemangioblastoma growth rate, and is a potential therapeutic option for VHL patients that warrants further investigation. © 2011 The Author(s).",Excluded
2318,"Robot-assisted intravertebral augmentation corrects local kyphosis more effectively than a conventional fluoroscopy-guided technique. OBJECTIVE Intravertebral augmentation (IVA) is a reliable minimally invasive technique for treating Magerl type A vertebral body fractures. However, poor correction of kyphotic angulation, the risk of cement leakage, and significant exposure to radiation (for the surgeon, the operating room staff, and the patient) remain significant issues. The authors conducted a study to assess the value of robot-assisted IVA (RA-IVA) for thoracolumbar vertebral body fractures. METHODS The authors performed a retrospective, single-center study of patients who had undergone RA-IVA or conventional fluoroscopy-guided IVA (F-IVA) for thoracolumbar vertebral body fractures. Installation and operating times, guidance accuracy, residual local kyphosis, degree of restoration of vertebral body height, incidence of cement leakage, rate of morbidity, length of hospital stay, and radiation-related data were recorded. RESULTS Data obtained in 30 patients who underwent RA-IVA were compared with those obtained in 30 patients who underwent F-IVA during the same period (the surgical indications were identical, but the surgeons were different). The mean +/- SD installation time in the RA-IVA group (24 +/- 7.5 minutes) was significantly shorter (p = 0.005) than that in the F-IVA group (26 +/- 8 minutes). The mean operating time for the RA-IVA group (52 +/- 11 minutes) was significantly longer (p = 0.026) than that for the F-IVA group (30 +/- 11 minutes). All RA-IVAs and F-IVAs were Ravi's scale grade A (no pedicle breach). The mean degree of residual local kyphosis (4.7degree +/- 3.15degree) and the percentage of vertebral body height restoration (63.6% +/- 21.4%) were significantly better after RA-IVA than after F-IVA (8.4degree +/- 5.4degree and 30% +/- 34%, respectively). The incidence of cement leakage was significantly lower in the RA-IVA group (p < 0.05). The mean length of hospital stay after surgery was 3.2 days for both groups. No surgery-related complications occurred in either group. With RA-IVA, the mean radiation exposure was 438 +/- 147 mGy x cm for the patient and 30 +/- 17 mGy for the surgeon. CONCLUSIONS RA-IVA provided better vertebral body fracture correction than the conventional F-IVA. However, RA-IVA requires more time than F-IVA.Copyright ©AANS 2019.",Excluded
1751,"The relationship between dose heterogeneity ('hot' spots) and complications following high-dose rate brachytherapy. Purpose: It is generally believed that 'hot' spots should be avoided in radiotherapy because they lead to complications. Dose homogeneity within the target volume is much more difficult to achieve during brachytherapy than during external beam irradiation, and implants are rarely geometrically perfect. To not underdose some parts of the target volume, therefore, it may be necessary to accept hot spots in other parts of the target volumes, but it is not at all clear from the literature how much dose heterogeneity should be considered excessive. We undertook this study in an effort to determine just how high a dose to a hot spot is associated with clinically significant complications. Methods and Materials: We studied 40 patients treated by high- dose rate brachytherapy with or without external irradiation. For each patient, we calculated the minimum dose to the 'hottest' 1 cubic centimeter (cc) volume (Dmax1) and, for 18 patients, the minimum dose to the hottest 10 cc volume (Dmax10) as well. Result(s): Considerable dose heterogeneity existed within the target volume. The Dmax1 ranged from 150-2000% (median 320%) of the minimum target dose (MTD). The median MTD/fraction was 2.50 Gy (range 1.50-25.00), and the median Dmax1/fraction was 10.00 Gy (range 3.75-150.00). The median Dmax1 from the entire course of brachytherapy was 75.00 Gy (range 25.00-550.00). Adding the doses from planned external irradiation, plus any prior irradiation to the same area, the median total Dmax1 was 112.50 Gy (range 30.00-580.00), yet the incidence of complications, even among those in the highest quartile of this dose range, was not greater than the lowest quartile. The total median Dmax10 was 85.00 Gy (range 32.00-130.00), but the incidence of complications was, again, similar whether the dose was in the lower or the upper half of this range (32.00-85.00 Gy, or 86.00-130.00 Gy, respectively). Conclusion(s): We had expected to find that the patients with the highest Dmax1 and/or Dmax10 would be the ones most likely to suffer complications, but the results did not support this hypothesis. Thus, dose heterogeneity, within the scope of our study, turned out to be rather unimportant with regard to complications. This finding contradicts the conventional wisdom and suggests that concerns about hot spots need not preclude optimization to ensure adequate dosage to all parts of the target volume.",Excluded

Objective: To compare the efficacy of a combination of intra-articular injections of Hyaluronic Acid (HA) under ultrasound guide together with Manual Therapy associated with Exercise Therapy with HA Injection only in the treatment of patients with hip osteoarthritis. Study Design: Case control. Subjects: In our study, we evaluated 59 patients, 19 female and 40 male, with average age 60.7 (max 84 and min 38) divided between sedentary individuals and those practicing sport at professional and nonprofessional levels all suffering from hip osteoarthritis. Intervention(s): Thirty-three patients (10 sedentary, 4 professional, and 19 nonprofessional) were treated with HA injections combined with Manual Therapy and Exercise Therapy, and 26 (18 sedentary and 8 nonprofessional) with HA injections only. All patients were subjected to x-ray and MRI of the hip and, during the first examination in our surgery, a hip echography using the Migliore-Tormenta technique. The rehabilitation protocol consisted of a combination of Manual Therapy and Physical Exercises and started at the moment of the first injection. The program lasted 6 weeks and each patient was treated once or twice a week. The goal of the program was to increase mobility, strength, and control of the hip joint. Outcome Measures: At the beginning of the study we evaluated active and passive hip range of motion (ROM) and the general joint functions through functional movements tests (Step Up, Trendelemburg Test, Deep Squat Test) and special tests (FABER Test, Ober Test, Thomas Test, Compression Test, Hip Prone Extension Test). After the initial evaluation we worked out an individual treatment protocol for each patient, focusing on the treatment of their own dysfunctions. Manual Therapy treatment consisted of a combination of soft tissue manipulation, myofascial stretching, and mobilization and/or manipulation techniques targeting movement limitations. Each Manual Therapy session lasted from 30 to 45 minutes. After the Manual Therapy treatment patients performed physical exercises consisting of joint mobility, followed by strength and neuromuscular control exercises. We used elastic resistance exercises, core training, balance training, and gait exercises. Patients were recommended to continue the entire exercise program at home between the physiotherapy sessions. At the end of the program we suggested that patients continue exercises at home in order to maintain the results, and to undergo a Manual Therapy session each month. Result(s): Patients who had HA injections combined with Manual Therapy and Exercise Therapy showed a greater reduction in pain VAS (.68%) than patients that had only HA injections (,49%). Regarding the functional state of the hip joint, patients treated with the combination of HA injections and rehabilitation showed a decrease of Lequesne index values (.58%) compared to patients who had only injections (35%). Conclusion(s): Our findings show that the combination of intra-articular injections of HA under ultrasound guide together with Manual Therapy associated with Exercise Therapy seems to be a better solution than HA Injection only in the conservative treatment of patients with hip osteoarthritis.",Excluded

AIM: To assess the value of a single-phase dual-energy computed tomography (DECT) urography protocol with synchronous nephrographic-excretory phase enhancement and to calculate the potential dose reduction by omitting the unenhanced scan., MATERIALS AND METHODS: Eighty-four patients referred for haematuria underwent CT urography using a protocol that included single-energy unenhanced and dual-energy contrast-enhanced with synchronous nephrographic-excretory phase scans. DECT-based images [virtual unenhanced (VUE), weighted average, and colour-coded iodine overlay] were reconstructed. Opacification degree by contrast media of the upper urinary tract, and image quality of virtual unenhanced images were independently evaluated using a four-point scale. The diagnostic accuracy in detecting urothelial tumours on DECT-based images was determined. The dose of a theoretical dual-phase single-energy protocol was obtained by multiplying the effective dose of the unenhanced single-energy acquisition by two. Radiation dose saving by omitting the unenhanced scan was calculated., RESULTS: The degree of opacification was scored as optimal or good in 86.9% of cases (k = 0.72); VUE image quality was excellent or good in 83.3% of cases (k = 0.82). Sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value for urothelial tumours detection were 85.7, 98.6, 92.3, and 97.1%. Omission of the unenhanced scan led to a mean dose reduction of 42.7 +/- 5%., CONCLUSION: Single-phase DECT urography with synchronous nephrographic-excretory phase enhancement represents an accurate ""all-in-one'' approach with a radiation dose saving up to 45% compared with a standard dual-phase protocol.

2254,"Safety considerations during transapical aortic valve implantation. OBJECTIVES Transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) is a new method for the treatment of very high-risk patients with aortic valve stenosis. The radiation dose to which the patient and each member of the heart team are exposed during this new fluoroscopically guided intervention is unknown. METHODS Between April 2008 and August 2013, 1177 consecutive patients underwent transapical TAVI (TA-TAVI). In 22 consecutive patients undergoing TA-TAVI, the radiation doses to the cardiothoracic surgeon, cardiologist, anaesthesiologist (performing echocardiography examination), surgical assistant and nurse were measured. The radiation dose measurements were performed during TAVI using thermoluminescence and film dosimeters positioned on seven parts of the body: (i) chest above the lead apron, (ii) pelvic area below the apron, (iii) chest below the apron, (iv) thyroid gland above the apron, (v) near eyes, (vi) hands (using rings) and (vii) the feet. The results were compared with the values given in the international literature on recommended radiation dose limits for workers. RESULTS The mean radiation time was 6.1 min and the mean dose-area product for the patients was 8.661 muGy . m2. Analysis of the dosimeters and the calculation of the effective dose showed a per intervention dose of 0.03 mSv for the surgeon, 0.05 mSv for the assistant, 0.02 mSv for the cardiologist and the anaesthesiologist and 0.001 mSv for the nurse. The maximum ionizing radiation per intervention was 0.5 mSv at the right hand of the surgeon (holding the introducer sheet) and 0.7 mSv at the left hand of the surgical assistant. Additionally, the analysis of the body dose shows a maximum dose to the lower leg of the surgeon (0.3 mSv) and the genital area of the assistant (0.06 mSv). CONCLUSIONS During a TA-TAVI procedure, the patients receive a higher X-ray dose than during coronary angiography with intervention. After 100 TAVI procedures, the members of the heart team sustain a comparable dose of ionizing radiation to the annual dose received by a busy interventional cardiologist. Therefore, maximal safety and optimal X-ray protection for patients and the members of the team are crucial and should be redefined. © The Author 2014.

1831,"Transgenerational effects of preconception paternal contamination with (55)Fe. The conjecture that germline mutations induced by radiation exposure before conception may predispose subsequent offspring to cancer remains contentious. Previous experimental studies have shown that preconception paternal irradiation with (239)Pu induces perturbations in the hemopoietic systems of offspring and influences sensitivity to a secondary carcinogen. In the present study, male DBA2 mice were injected intravenously with the Auger electron emitter (55)Fe (4 kBq g(-1)) 18 or 84 days before mating with normal females. Comet analysis showed an increased incidence of DNA strand breaks in sperm from contaminated animals after 84 days, but not after 18 days, indicating spermatogonial rather than spermatid damage. Offspring were either assayed for changes in bone marrow stem cells and committed progenitors or challenged with the chemical carcinogen methyl nitrosourea (MNU, 50 mg/kg) at 10 weeks of age and monitored for the onset of malignancy. Offspring from irradiated fathers had normal peripheral blood profiles, although the stem cell population was amplified in offspring arising from those exposed to (55)Fe at 84 days before conception. Exposure to MNU significantly increased the incidence of lympho-hemopoietic malignancies in offspring from the 84-day group, but not in those from the 18-day group. These findings support the hypothesis that aberrations that are potentially leukemogenic may be transmitted to offspring after radiation damage to the paternal germline.",Excluded

Objective: To assess the mutagenic effects of imidacloprid in germ cells of Swiss albino male mice by sperm head abnormality (SHA) assay and dominant lethal test (DLT). Method(s): Swiss albino mice were exposed to imidacloprid (22, 11 and 5.5 mg/kg/day) along with 3% gum acacia as vehicle control through oral route for 7, 14 and 28 days for SHA assay and for 28 days for DLT. The epididymal sperm smear in 1% eosin stain was analyzed for SHAs. In DLT, male mice were allowed to mate with females after 1, 3 and 6 weeks of end of pesticide treatment. The uterine contents of the sacrificed females were observed for live and dead implants. The analysis of test and control groups data was done by one way ANOVA at p < 0.05. Result(s): Exposure of all dose levels of imidacloprid (22, 11 and 5.5 mg/kg/day) for seven days did not induce significant SHAs while they induced significant SHAs compared with the control group following exposure for 14 and 28 days. The analysis of uterine content revealed a significant increase in the number of dead implants/female compared with the vehicle control in only those females which were mated with male mice after six weeks of treatment of highest dose level of imidacloprid. The dominant lethal mutations were observed only at spermatogonial stage. Conclusion(s): Long-term exposure of pesticide generated SHAs even at lowest dose level (5.5 mg/kg/day for 14 days) and mutagenic effects at spermatogonial stage at highest dose level (22 mg/kg/day for 28 days).

There is no standard approach for salvage treatment. Here we present toxicity and treatment results for recurrent NFC patients who underwent fractionated stereotactic radiotherapy (FSRT) as second line radiotherapy (RT)., MATERIALS AND METHODS: Between April 2009 and July 2012, 24 patients, with a male to female ratio of 3:1, were treated with CykerKnife R FSRT for recurrent NFC in our institution. Seven out of 24 patients had metastatic recurrent disease. Median age was 53 years (range, 20-70 years). Initial RT dose was 70Gy. The time period between initial RT and FSRT was a median of 33.2 months. The median prescription dose for FSRT was 30Gy (range, 24-30 Gy) in a median of 5 fractions (range, 4-6)., RESULTS: The median follow-up for all patients was 19.5 months (IQR: 12.2. -29.2 months). The locoregional control; progression free survival and overall survival (OS) rates for 1-, 2- and 3-year were 64%, 38%, 21%; 60%, 30%, 17% and 83%, 43%, 31%, respectively. Median OS for the entire cohort was 22 months (95% CI: 16.5-27.5). On multivariate analysis recurrent tumor stage was the only prognostic factor for OS (p=0.004). One patient exhibited grade III temporal lobe necrosis. One died because of grade IV mucositis and overlapping infection., CONCLUSIONS: The treatment of recurrent NPC is controversial. Fractionated stereotactic radiotherapy is promising. However, the published trials are heterogeneous with respect to the selection criteria and treatment details.

Purpose: To evaluate the feasibility and therapeutic efficacy of 1.5 T conventional MR-guided percutaneous interstitial implantation of I-125 radioactive seeds in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Material(s) and Method(s): The institutional ethics committee approved this study. After imformed consent was obtained, twenty-three patients suffering from a total of 65 HCC lesions were treated with I-125 seed permanent interstitial implantation under the guidance of a 1.5 T conventional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) system. The FSE T2WI, T1 FSPGR, FIESTA 2D, 3D Dyn T1WI sequences were used to guide an 18G MR-compatible needle inserted into the lesions to introduce the I-125 seeds. The response evaluation criteria in solid tumors (RECIST) were used to evaluate the curative effect. Result(s): The needle and I-125 seed were seen clearly on MRI images. The final dose delivered to total decay was 173.46 +/- 32.44 Gy (range, 110-270 Gy) as calculated by postoperative TPS. The complete response (CR) was seen in 22 lesions (33.8%), partial response (PR) in 24 lesions (36.9%), stable disease (SD) in 9 lesions (13.8%), and progressive disease (PD) in 10 lesions (15.4%).

1783,"Myocardial perfusion imaging with a cadmium zinc telluride-based gamma camera versus invasive fractional flow reserve. Purpose: Recently introduced ultrafast cardiac SPECT cameras with cadmium zinc telluride-based (CZT) detectors may provide superior image quality allowing faster acquisition with reduced radiation doses. Although the level of concordance between conventional SPECT and invasive fractional flow reserve (FFR) measurement has been studied, that between FFR and CZT-based SPECT is not yet known. Therefore, we aimed to assess the level of concordance between CZT SPECT and FFR in a large patient group with stable coronary artery disease. Method(s): Both invasive FFR and myocardial perfusion imaging with a CZT-based SPECT camera, using Tc-tetrofosmin as tracer, were performed in 100 patients with stable angina and intermediate grade stenosis on invasive coronary angiography. A cut-off value of <0.75 was used to define abnormal FFR. Result(s): The mean age of the patients was 64+/-11 years, and 64 % were men. SPECT demonstrated ischaemia in 31 % of the patients, and 20 % had FFR <0.75. The concordance between CZT SPECT and FFR was 73 % on a per-patient basis and 79 % on a per-vessel basis. Discordant findings were more often seen in older patients and were mainly (19 %) the result of ischaemic SPECT findings in patients with FFR >=0.75, whereas only 8 % had an abnormal FFR without ischaemia as demonstrated by CZT SPECT. Conclusion(s): Only 20 - 30 % of patients with intermediate coronary stenoses had significant ischaemia as assessed by CZT SPECT or invasive FFR. CZT SPECT showed a modest degree of concordance with FFR, which is comparable with previous results with conventional SPECT. Further investigations are particularly necessary in patients with normal SPECT and abnormal FFR, especially to determine whether these patients should undergo revascularization. © 2013 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.",Excluded
2999,"Cutaneous T-cell lymphoma: Trends in radiation doses and patterns of care 2004-2015. Background and Aim: Radiotherapy is an effective treatment for cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (CTCL). Since 2009, studies have advocated for low-dose radiotherapy (<30 Gy) given it results in similar response rates and less toxicity compared to higher doses (>=30 Gy). We aimed to see if low-dose radiotherapy has been adopted on a national scale in the USA. Material(s) and Method(s): A total of 11,292 adult patients with CTCL were identified in the National Cancer Database. Logistic regression models were created to evaluate predictors for use of low-dose radiotherapy. Result(s): A minority of patients received low-dose radiotherapy (22.4%). The annual percentage of patients receiving low-dose radiotherapy increased from 17.2% in 2009 to 38.4% in 2015. High-volume facilities were associated with use of low-dose radiotherapy (5th quintile vs. bottom two quintiles, odds ratio(OR)=1.76, 95% confidence interval(CI)=1.22-2.54, p=0.003). Conclusion(s): Although the radiotherapy dose administered is decreasing, most patients with CTCL are still receiving doses that may be higher than needed to palliate their disease effectively.Copyright © 2019 International Institute of Anticancer Research.

1605,"Impact of cardiac resynchronisation therapy on cardiologists' exposure to radiation during implantation of pacemakers and implantable cardioverter-defibrillators. Cardiologists are among the health professionals that are most exposed to ionizing radiation, but there is no recent study quantifying overexposure of physicians during cardiac resynchronisation therapy (CRT) procedures compared to 'classical' implantation of pacemakers (PMs) or implantable cardioverter-defibrillators (ICDs). We aimed to measure and compare operator exposure to radiation during implantation of PM and ICD with or without CRT. The study population comprised all PMs and ICDs implanted in a large referral centre over a six months period. The endpoint was operator radiation exposure, assessed using a personal electronic dosimeter located on operator's chest. In total, 169 PM/ICD implantations were analysed, 19 of which included CRT. Compared with 'classical' implantation, cardiologist radiation exposure was 9-fold greater during CRT procedures (p < 0.001). Physician exposure was related to dose-area product (R2 = 0.21 during 'classical' implantations and R2 = 0.57 during CRT procedures). Our study shows that cardiologists' exposure to radiation during CRT implantation was 9-fold greater than during procedures without CRT.",Excluded
3262,"Acute toxicity and risk of infection during total skin electron beam therapy for mycosis fungoides. BACKGROUND: Detailed rates of acute toxicity and skin infection during total skin electron beam therapy (TSEBT) for mycosis fungoides have not been reported in a large, modern series., OBJECTIVE: We sought to demonstrate the rates of acute toxicity and skin infection during TSEBT., METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed 89 consecutive courses of TSEBT. In all, 82 courses were prescribed a dose of 30 to 36 Gy and were included in the toxicity analysis. We recorded the types and grades of acute treatment toxicities and the incidence of infection during TSEBT for comparison with the previously documented baseline incidence of infection in mycosis fungoides., RESULTS: The most common toxicities included erythema/desquamation (76%), blisters (52%), hyperpigmentation (50%), and skin pain (48%). The worst reported toxicity grade per patient was grade 1 in 21%, grade 2 in 67%, and grade 3 in 10%, with no grade 4 or 5 toxicities. According to the previously reported rate, a total of 2.4 infections were expected for our cohort at baseline. The number with skin infection was 26 (32%) (relative risk 10.8, P < .01), and of these, 12 (15%) were culture confirmed (relative risk 5.0, P < .01)., LIMITATIONS: This was a retrospective study design., CONCLUSION: The risk of cutaneous infection is significant during TSEBT.

1992,"Consequences of the radiation accident at the Mayak production association in 1957 (the 'Kyshtym Accident'). This paper presents an overview of the nuclear accident that occurred at the Mayak Production Association (PA) in the Russian Federation on 29 September 1957, often referred to as 'Kyshtym Accident', when 20 MCi (740 PBq) of radionuclides were released by a chemical explosion in a radioactive waste storage tank. 2 MCi (74 PBq) spread beyond the Mayak PA site to form the East Urals Radioactive Trace (EURT). The paper describes the accident and gives brief characteristics of the efficacy of the implemented protective measures that made it possible to considerably reduce doses to the exposed population. The paper also provides retrospective dosimetry estimates for the members of the EURT Cohort (EURTC) which comprises approximately 21 400 people. During the first two years after the accident a decrease in the group average leukocyte (mainly due to neutrophils and lymphocytes) and thrombocyte count was observed in the population. At later dates an increased excess relative risk of solid cancer incidence and mortality was found in the EURTC.",Excluded
1392,"A predictive model for residual disease after (chemo) radiotherapy in oropharyngeal carcinoma: Combined radiological and clinical evaluation of tumor response. Background and purpose Early detection of Residual disease (RD) is vital for salvage possibilities after (chemo) radiatiotherapy for oropharyngeal carcinoma (OPC). We standardized clinical investigation to test its added value to MRI response evaluation and investigated the benefit of FDG-PET/CT. Materials and methods Radiological response evaluation using Ojiri-score was done for 234 patients with OPC, using MRI 12 weeks after (chemo) radiotherapy between 2010 and 2014. The presence of mucosal lesions and/or major complaints (still completely tube feeding-dependent and/or opiate-dependent because of swallowing problems) was scored as clinical suspicion (CS). Retrospectively, the performance of Ojiri to predict RD was compared to CS and both combined using Pearson Chi-squared. Of the whole group, FDG-PET/CT metabolic response (MR) was available in 50 patients. Results Twelve out of 234 patients (5.1%) had RD. Ojiri and CS had excellent negative predictive value (NPV) (98% and 100% respectively). The combination of CS and Ojiri reduced false positives by 32% (38-26 patients) without lowering NPV (98%). No patients with complete MR (n = 39) at the FDG-PET/CT had RD compared to 5 (45%) with partial MR. Conclusion For response evaluation in OPC, the combination of CS and Ojiri-score improved the predictive accuracy by reducing false positives compared to them individually. FDG-PET/CT is promising to further reduce false positives.Copyright © 2017 The Authors",Excluded
2044,"Efficacy of glutamine in the prevention of acute radiation enteritis: a randomized controlled trial. BACKGROUND: Acute radiation enteritis is a common adverse effect related to radiotherapy (RT). Glutamine is an immune modulator and antioxidant amino acid that can exert a protective role in patients receiving abdominal or pelvic radiation. The aim of this study was to test if glutamine prevents radiation enteritis during RT., MATERIALS AND METHODS: Double-blind, randomized, controlled trial including 69 patients who needed RT because of pelvic or abdominal malignancies and received glutamine (30 g/d) or placebo (casein, 30 g/d). Enteritis was evaluated according to the Radiation Therapy Oncology Group scale, intestinal inflammation using fecal calprotectin, and gut integrity with citrulline. The incidence of enteritis was analyzed by Kaplan-Meier curves, and the hazard ratio (HR) was calculated using Cox regression., RESULTS: Patients were predominantly male (65.2%), with an average (SD) age of 66.6 (9.9) years, with urologic (44.9%), rectal (24.6%), or gynecological cancer (23.1%). More patients developed enteritis with glutamine than with the placebo (55.9% vs 22.0%; P = .002), with an HR OF 1.59 (95% confidence interval, 0.624.05). There were no differences in final calprotectin levels (glutamine, 57.9 [85.8] mg/kg vs placebo, 54.0 [57.7] mg/kg; p = .182) or the number of patients with values 50 mg/kg (glutamine, 58.1% vs placebo, 54.6%; p = .777). Final citrulline levels were similar between groups (glutamine, 26.31 [10.29] mmol/l vs placebo, 27.69 [12.31] mmol/l; p = .639), without differences in the number of patients with 20 mmol/l (glutamine, 24.1% vs placebo, 25.0%; P = .938). Citrulline concentration was reduced during rt with placebo but remained unchanged with glutamine., CONCLUSION: Glutamine does not prevent the development of enteritis during RT.",Excluded

3673,"Prospective Pilot Study of Consolidation Chemotherapy With Docetaxel and Cisplatin After Concurrent Chemoradiotherapy for Advanced Head and Neck Cancer. Purpose: With the improvement concurrent chemoradiotherapy (CCRT) in the management of patients with locoregionally advanced head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC), distant failures have become a more relevant problem in terms of survival. The primary objective of this Phase II study is to assess the feasibility of docetaxel and cisplatin consolidation after primary CCRT for patients with HNSCC. Methods and Materials: Patients with locoregionally advanced HNSCC received chemotherapy with three cycles of cisplatin, 100 mg/m2, on Days 1, 22, and 43. Concurrent radiotherapy to the primary tumor and neck was given in a daily dose of 2 Gy to a total dose of 70-70.2 Gy over 7 weeks. After completion of CCRT, patients without evidence of disease progression received an additional four cycles of consolidation chemotherapy with docetaxel, 75 mg/m2, and cisplatin, 75 mg/m2, every 3 weeks. Result(s): Of 33 patients, 27 (81%) completed CCRT. After CCRT, three complete and 19 partial responses were recorded, giving an overall response rate of 67%. Of 19 patients who went to the consolidation phase, only 4 (21%) received all four cycles of docetaxel and cisplatin. Causes of failure of consolidation chemotherapy were toxicity in 11 patients, including three treatment-related deaths, and progression in 4 patients. Three patients died of sepsis during the consolidation phase. Median survival was 11 months for all patients and 8 months for those treated with consolidation chemotherapy. Conclusion(s): The poor compliance and high incidence of severe toxicities prompted no further evaluation of this consolidation chemotherapy after CCRT. © 2008 Elsevier Inc.

1511,"A phase I/II trial of intensity modulated radiation (IMRT) dose escalation with concurrent fixed-dose rate gemcitabine (FDR-G) in patients with unresectable pancreatic cancer. Purpose: Local failure in unresectable pancreatic cancer may contribute to death. We hypothesized that intensification of local therapy would improve local control and survival. The objectives were to determine the maximum tolerated radiation dose delivered by intensity modulated radiation with fixed-dose rate gemcitabine (FDR-G), freedom from local progression (FFLP), and overall survival (OS). Methods and Materials: Eligibility included pathologic confirmation of adenocarcinoma, radiographically unresectable, performance status of 0-2, absolute neutrophil count of >=1500/mm3, platelets >=100,000/mm3, creatinine <2 mg/dL, bilirubin <3 mg/dL, and alanine aminotransferase/aspartate aminotransferase <=2.5 x upper limit of normal. FDR-G (1000 mg/m2/100 min intravenously) was given on days -22 and -15, 1, 8, 22, and 29. Intensity modulated radiation started on day 1. Dose levels were escalated from 50-60 Gy in 25 fractions. Dose-limiting toxicity was defined as gastrointestinal toxicity grade (G) >=3, neutropenic fever, or deterioration in performance status to >=3 between day 1 and 126. Dose level was assigned using TITE-CRM (Time-to-Event Continual Reassessment Method) with the target dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) rate set to 0.25. Result(s): Fifty patients were accrued. DLTs were observed in 11 patients: G3/4 anorexia, nausea, vomiting, and/or dehydration (7); duodenal bleed (3); duodenal perforation (1). The recommended dose is 55 Gy, producing a probability of DLT of 0.24. The 2-year FFLP is 59% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 32-79). Median and 2-year overall survival are 14.8 months (95% CI: 12.6-22.2) and 30% (95% CI 17-45). Twelve patients underwent resection (10 R0, 2 R1) and survived a median of 32 months. Conclusion(s): High-dose radiation therapy with concurrent FDR-G can be delivered safely. The encouraging efficacy data suggest that outcome may be improved in unresectable patients through intensification of local therapy. © 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.",Excluded
1185,"Radiotherapy in cancer tongue base: Use of 'half beam shielding blocks' technique with 60Co. Personal experience. Background. The results obtained in the treatment of tongue base carcinomas using gamma photon of a Cobalt Unit and 'half beam shielding blocks' technique are reported. Methods. From January 1988 through December 1995, 69 patients affected with tongue base carcinoma were treated with radiation therapy at the Radiotherapy Department of Umberto I Hospital in Mestre, Italy. The patients were mostly males (M:F=4.75:1), their age ranging from 39-85 years (mean: 64.2 years). Staging, performed according to TNM classification (UICC criteria) showed 17 cases in stage II, 19 in stage III and 33 in stage IV, with prevalence of squamous cell carcinoma. Seventeen patients were treated with radical surgery. All patients were treated with radiotherapy with gamma photon of a Cobalt Unit and using the 'half beam shielding blocks' technique and junction level on the hyoid axis. Treatment planning was always studied on an extensive number of CT scans on which target volume and normal tissues were defined and performed using Theraplan V05 program, Theratronics. The dose to the target volume was 50 Gy/25 fractions after radical surgery and 60 Gy/30 fractions for exclusive radiotherapy and after non radical surgery. Results. Overall 3-years and 5- years survival were 39% and 31% respectively (+/-0.0668), disease free 5-years survival was 39%. A better prognosis for initial stage lesions with statistically significant difference (p-value=0.0116), and for patients treated with radical surgery plus radiography (p-value=0.008) was obtained. Fifty-four patients obtained a complete remission; the other fifteen a partial remission. Twenty-one patients showed loco-regional relapse; thirty- six died, thirty of them with disease. Conclusions. The data obtained show that the 'half beam shielding blocks' technique can be used also with gamma photon of a Cobalt Unit, and that the local control wasn't obtained using the conventional doses and radiotherapy technique. Better results should be obtained using new radiotherapy techniques and new combined approaches.",Excluded
137,"Elective nodal irradiation with simultaneous integrated boost stereotactic body radiation therapy for pancreatic cancer. Purpose/Objective(s): Stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) is increasingly being used for pancreatic cancer, even in the neoadjuvant setting for borderline resectable diseases. However, data from RTOG 9704 highlights the importance of elective coverage in resected pancreatic cancer. We evaluate the dose coverage of the elective nodal CTV in the standard tumor only SBRT plans and in alternative dose painting SBRT strategy to cover some nodal volume. Materials/Methods: The standard SBRT plans and the simultaneous integrated boost (SIB)-SBRT plans were retrospectively generated for each of 10 different patients with unresectable pancreatic cancer. Both plans used IMRT technique and seven to nine non-coplanar 6-10 MV photon beams to deliver 33 Gy in 5 fractions to GTV and PTV1. In SIB-SBRT plans, 25 Gy in 5 fractions was simultaneously prescribed to the elective nodal CTV and PTV2. The elective nodal regions of peri-pancreas, retropancreas, porta-hepatis, and para-aorta were included in CTV depending on the primary tumor location in pancreas. Dose constraints for organs-atrisk (OARs) were referred to the previous multi-institutional SBRT trial. The constraints to luminal OARs, namely stomach, duodenum, and small bowel, were regarded as the hard constraints; D9cc, D3cc, and D1cc of each luminal organ should be less than 15 Gy, 20 Gy, and 33 Gy, respectively. The dose reduction in the target for proximal part from the luminal OARs was allowed to meet the hard constraints. The target coverages and OAR doses were analyzed and compared. Result(s): The tumor was located in the head in 7, the body in 2, and the tail in 1 cases. The mean (range) size of GTV and CTV were 50.4 mL (5.2e106 mL) and 320 mL (93.7e453 mL), respectively. The mean of minimum distances to the closest luminal organs were 2.0 mm (0e13.2 mm). The mean +/- SDs of D95 of GTV in standard SBRT vs. SIB-SBRT plans were 96.6 +/- 7.4% vs. 95.8 +/- 7.6%, respectively (P = 0.40). Whereas, D95 of CTV were 4.4 +/- 5.9 Gy vs. 19.9 +/- 5.3 Gy (P < 0.001), respectively. The OAR doses were significantly higher with SIB-SBRT plans in D9cc of stomach, D1cce9cc of duodenum, and D1cce9cc of small bowel. However, no plans violated the hard constraints with SIBSBRT strategy. Conclusion(s): SIB-SBRT strategy was dosimetrically feasible for covering the elective nodal volume in pancreatic cancer. The elective nodal coverage with SIB-SBRT strategy can be one of the treatment options for pancreatic SBRT and should be further investigated.",Excluded
1105,"53BP1 Repair Kinetics for Prediction of In Vivo Radiation Susceptibility in 15 Mouse Strains. We present a novel mathematical formalism to predict the kinetics of DNA damage repair after exposure to both low- and high-LET radiation (X rays; 350 MeV/n 40Ar; 600 MeV/n 56Fe). Our method is based on monitoring DNA damage repair protein 53BP1 that forms radiation-induced foci (RIF) at locations of DNA double-strand breaks (DSB) in the nucleus and comparing its expression in primary skin fibroblasts isolated from 15 mice strains. We previously reported strong evidence for clustering of nearby DSB into single repair units as opposed to the classic ""contact-first"" model where DSB are considered immobile. Here we apply this clustering model to evaluate the number of remaining RIF over time. We also show that the newly introduced kinetic metrics can be used as surrogate biomarkers for in vivo radiation toxicity, with potential applications in radiotherapy and human space exploration. In particular, we observed an association between the characteristic time constant of RIF repair measured in vitro and survival levels of immune cells collected from irradiated mice. Moreover, the speed of DNA damage repair correlated not only with radiation-induced cellular survival in vivo, but also with spontaneous cancer incidence data collected from the Mouse Tumor Biology database, suggesting a relationship between the efficiency of DSB repair after irradiation and cancer risk.Copyright ©2020 by Radiation Research Society.

777,"Questionnaire Survey of Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant Workers in 2016 on Knowledge and Anxiety About Radiation. The results of a survey of radiation workers suggest that they are worried about the effects of radiation exposure on health, and approximately 30% of Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant (FDNPP) workers have anxiety. This questionnaire survey reveals that the higher the frequency of radiation education, the higher the knowledge of radiation the workers will have, and that the higher the level of knowledge, the lower the anxiety. To reduce anxiety, it is important to increase knowledge about radiation through radiation education. However, even those workers who had radiation education several times still had anxiety. According to the Ordinance on the Prevention of Ionizing Radiation Hazards, the time spent on education about the effects of radiation on the human body is only about 30 minutes. This education is not enough to reduce anxiety. FDNPP workers needed more effective education to increase their knowledge and to reduce their anxiety.",Excluded
660,"Evaluation of salivary gland function after treatment of head-and-neck tumors with intensity-modulated radiotherapy by quantitative pertechnetate scintigraphy. Purpose: To evaluate salivary gland function after inversely planned stereotactic intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) for tumors of the head-and-neck region using quantitative pertechnetate scintigraphy. Methods and Materials: Since January 2000, 18 patients undergoing IMRT for cancer of the head and neck underwent pre- and posttherapeutic scintigraphy to examine salivary gland function. The mean dose to the primary planning target volume was 61.5 Gy (range 50.4-73.2), and the median follow-up was 23 months. In all cases, the parotid glands were directly adjacent to the planning target volume. The treatment planning goal was for at least one parotid gland to receive a mean dose of <26 Gy. Two quantitative parameters (change in maximal uptake and change in the relative excretion rate before and after IMRT) characterizing the change in salivary gland function after radiotherapy were determined. These parameters were compared with respect to the dose thresholds of 26 and 30 Gy for the mean dose. In addition, dose-response curves were calculated. Result(s): Using IMRT, it was possible in 16 patients to reduce the dose for at least one parotid gland to <=26 Gy. In 7 patients, protection of both parotid glands was possible. No recurrent disease adjacent to the protected parotid glands was observed. Using the Radiation Therapy Oncology Group/European Organization for the Research and Treatment of Cancer scoring system, only 3 patients had Grade 2 xerostomia. No greater toxicity was seen for the salivary glands. The change in the relative excretion rate was significantly greater, if the parotid glands received a mean dose of >=26 Gy or >=30 Gy. For the change in maximal uptake, a statistically significant difference was seen only for the parotid glands and a dose threshold of 30 Gy. For the end point of a reduction in the parotid excretion rate of <50% and 75%, the dose-response curves yielded a dose at 50% complication probability of 34.8 +/- 3.6 and 40.8 +/- 5.3 Gy, respectively. Conclusion(s): Using IMRT, it is possible to protect the parotid glands and reduce the incidence and severity of xerostomia in patients. Doses <26-30 Gy significantly preserve salivary gland function. The results support the hypothesis that application of IMRT does not lead to increased local failure rates. © 2004 Elsevier Inc.",Excluded

Background/Hypothesis: The need for a neck dissection after radiochemotherapy (RCT) for patients with unresectable cancer of the head and neck remains questionable. We evaluated our strategy to perform a neck dissection in patients with a controlled primary tumor based on the response to RCT according to regional control, survival rates, and morbidity. Study Design: The French Groupe d'Etude des Tumeurs de la Tete et du Cou"" (GETTEC) group retrospectively performed a multicenter review. One hundred and three stage III (N=7) or IV (N=96) patients with unresectable primary tumors and node-positive disease and no distant metastases treated between 1996 and 2002. Tumors were considered unresectable or with poor surgical curability based on advanced stage, or patients were surgically unfit for medical reasons. Result(s): With a median follow-up of 30 months, the complete clinical and radiological nodal response rate was 61%. Among 39% (N=40) of patients with residual neck disease, 70% (N=28) underwent a neck dissection, whereas the remaining 30% either underwent watchful follow-up for probable scary nodes, or were deemed unresectable or medically unfit for surgery. Half of the neck dissection specimens showed pathological evidence of viable tumor. Grade 3 to 4 complications were recorded in four patients (14%) after neck dissection. Regional control was better for complete responders. Disease-free survival and overall survival were similar between patients with a complete response in the neck and no neck dissection, and patients with a neck dissection for residual neck disease. Conclusion(s): The strategy to avoid a neck dissection is safe in patients with a complete response in the neck, regardless of initial nodal stage. In patients with residual neck disease, postRCT neck dissection can be performed with limited morbidity. Progress is warranted to optimize the pathological response in the nodes and to better assess ambiguous nodal responses with multi-modal imaging. © 2008 The American Laryngological, Rhinological and Otological Society, Inc.""",Excluded

The effect of proton pump inhibitor (PPI) therapy on extraesophageal or atypical manifestations of gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) remains unclear. This study aimed to evaluate the prevalence of atypical manifestations in patients with acid reflux disease and the effect of PPI treatment. Patients with symptoms and signs suggestive of reflux were enrolled. Erosive esophagitis was stratified using the Los Angeles classification. Demographic data and symptoms were assessed using a questionnaire and included typical symptoms (heartburn, regurgitation, dysphagia, odynophagia), and atypical symptoms (e.g., chest pain, sialorrhea, hoarseness, globus sensation, chronic coughing, episodic bronchospasm, hiccup, eructations, laryngitis, and pharyngitis). Symptoms were reassessed after a 3-month course of b.i.d. PPI therapy. A total of 266 patients with a first diagnosis of GERD (erosive, 166; non-erosive, 100) were entered in the study. Presentation with atypical symptoms was approximately equal in those with erosive GERD and with non-erosive GERD, 72% vs 79% (P = 0.18).

3518,"Skin Dose Reduction by Layer-Stacking Irradiation in Carbon Ion Radiotherapy for Parotid Tumors. Background: Layer-stacking irradiation (LSI) results in the accumulation of multiple small spread-out Bragg peaks along the beam direction. Although the superiority of LSI to conventional passive irradiation (CPI) regarding normal tissue sparing is theoretically evident, the clinical benefit of LSI has not been demonstrated. Here, we compared LSI with CPI using the same treatment planning-computed tomography images used for carbon ion radiotherapy (CIRT). Method(s): Twenty-one parotid tumors were analyzed. The clinical target volume (CTV) 1 and CTV2 encompassed the parotid grand and the tumor, respectively. CTV1 and CTV2 received 36 Gy (RBE: relative biological effectiveness) in nine fractions and 64 Gy (RBE) in 16 fractions, respectively, using either LSI or CPI. CTV coverage was assessed by DX%, which is the dose covering at least X% of the target volume. Skin dose was assessed by SX, which is the skin surface area receiving at least X Gy (RBE). Result(s): For CTV1 and CTV2, there were no significant differences in D2% between LSI and CPI. D50% and D98% were slightly higher for CPI; however, the absolute difference between the two methods was <3%. S10-S60 (in increments of 10) were significantly lower for LSI than for CPI (P < 0.001 for all parameters). LSI was associated with a significant trend toward dose reduction at the skin area irradiated with a higher dose by CPI (P < 0.001). Conclusion(s): LSI achieved better skin sparing than CPI without sacrificing target volume coverage in parotid tumor patients.© Copyright © 2020 Kubo, Kubota, Oike, Kawamura, Sakai, Imamura, Komatsu, Miyasaka, Sato, Musha, Okano, Shirai, Saitoh, Chikamatsu and Ohno.",Excluded

AFX is a rare tumor usually found in sun exposed skin of head and neck region in elderly Caucasian men. Rarely, it has a second peak in young adults, where it is found in trunk and extremities. The present case is reported as AFX is quite unusual in a young female with a nodule in the leg which was clinically diagnosed as a malignant melanoma. Only a few cases of AFX have been reported in young women. This case highlights the fact that accurate diagnosis of atypical fibroxanthoma is very crucial so as to avoid overenthusiastic and overzealous treatment as required for a malignant tumor.Copyright © 2015 Journal of Cancer Research and Therapeutics Published by Wolters Kluwer - Medknow.",Excluded
2690,"Stereotactic radiosurgery for the treatment of symptomatic brainstem cavernous malformations. OBJECT: The authors performed a retrospective review of prospectively collected data to evaluate the safety and efficacy of stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) for the treatment of patients harboring symptomatic solitary cavernous malformations (CMs) of the brainstem that bleed repeatedly and are high risk for resection. METHOD(S): Between 1988 and 2005, 68 patients (34 males and 34 females) with solitary, symptomatic CMs of the brainstem underwent Gamma Knife surgery. The mean patient age was 41.2 years, and all patients had suffered at least 2 symptomatic hemorrhages (range 2-12 events) before radiosurgery. Prior to SRS, 15 patients (22.1%) had undergone attempted resection. The mean volume of the malformation treated was 1.19 ml, and the mean prescribed marginal radiation dose was 16 Gy. RESULT(S): The mean follow-up period was 5.2 years (range 0.6-12.4 years). The pre-SRS annual hemorrhage rate was 32.38%, or 125 hemorrhages, excluding the first hemorrhage, over a total of 386 patient-years. Following SRS, 11 hemorrhages were observed within the first 2 years of follow-up (8.22% annual hemorrhage rate) and 3 hemorrhages were observed in the period after the first 2 years of follow-up (1.37% annual hemorrhage rate). A significant reduction (p < 0.0001) in the risk of brainstem CM hemorrhages was observed following radiosurgical treatment, as well as in latency period of 2 years after SRS (p < 0.0447). Eight patients (11.8%) experienced new neurological deficits as a result of adverse radiation effects following SRS. CONCLUSION(S): The results of this study support a role for the use of SRS for symptomatic CMs of the brainstem, as it is relatively safe and appears to reduce rebleeding rates in this high-surgical-risk location.",Excluded
394,"Induction chemotherapy with cisplatin and ifosfamide in locally advanced inoperable squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck: A single-institution experience. BACKGROUND: Induction chemotherapy (ICT) in patients with head and neck cancer has been studied since a long time. The addition of taxanes to the cisplatin and 5-fluorouracil (5FU) (PF) regimen results in superior antitumor activity. We did this study to see the response and toxicity of ICT with cisplatin and ifosfamide followed by concurrent chemoradiotherapy (CRT) in locally advanced, unresectable squamous cell carcinoma of head and neck (SCCHN). AIMS: The aim of this study was to see the results of ICT using cisplatin and ifosfamide regimen in locally advanced unresectable SCCHN in terms of acute and chronic toxicity and response to treatment. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Patients with Stage III and IV, nonmetastatic SCCHN were enrolled in the study. They were given two cycles of ICT with cisplatin and ifosfamide followed by CRT. RESULT(S): After ICT, the overall response rate (ORR) was 75.0% at the primary site and 70.0% at the nodal site. ORR for combined primary and nodal disease was observed to be 67.5%. The complete response (CR) and partial response (PR) for combined primary and nodal site were seen in 4 (10.0%) and 23 (57.5%) patients. Of 32 patients who received CRT after ICT, CR was 53.1% and PR was 31.3%. Mucositis, skin reaction, and pharyngeal and laryngeal toxicities were the most common but tolerable. CONCLUSION(S): ICT with cisplatin and ifosfamide gives comparable results to the standard paclitaxel, PF regimen. We conclude that this combination regimen for ICT is not only an economical alternative of taxol-based regimen but also well tolerated by the patients.Copyright © 2017 Indian Journal of Cancer.",Excluded

Effectiveness, safety, and tolerability of instillation therapy with chondroitin sulphate (CAS 9082-07-9, Gepan instill) was investigated in a non-interventional study. 286 patients with clinically diagnosed chronic forms of cystitis, such as bladder pain syndrome/interstitial cystitis, radiation cystitis, overactive bladder syndrome and chronically-recurring cystitis were included. The course of symptoms was documented over 8 instillations at maximum, covering a period of approximately three months. All main symptoms of chronic cystitis declined consistently and statistically significantly (p < 0.0001). Both daytime and nighttime micturition frequencies as well as the score levels of urgency and pain declined significantly during the course of treatment. The functional bladder capacity as indicated by the volume of first morning voiding increased from 157.9 ml +/- 7.5 to 186.7 ml +/- 6.9 (mean +/- SE; p < 0.0001). The level of urgency decreased from 6.8 +/- 0.1 to 3.4 +/- 0.2 (mean +/- SE; numerical rating scale (11-point box scale); p < 0.0001) and nocturia decreased from 4.0 +/- 0.2 to 2.1 +/- 0.1 times (mean +/- SE; p < 0.0001). Chondroitin sulphate instillation was effective and well tolerated in the therapy of chronic forms of cystitis associated with a possible GAG layer deficit (GAG layer: mainly composed of the glycosaminoglycans chondroitin sulphate, dermatan sulphate and heparan sulphate), but the results need to be confirmed in a controlled study. © ECV .

3514,"[The effect of proton pump inhibitor on healing of post-esophageal variceal ligation ulcers]. BACKGROUND/AIMS: Esophageal variceal ligation (EVL) is the most preferable method for controlling variceal bleeding. However, EVL is associated with complications such as hemorrhage, chest pain, dysphagia, and odynophagia due to post-EVL ulcers in the esophageal mucosa. The aim of this study was to assess the effect of proton pump inhibitor (PPI), pantoprazole on the healing of post-EVL ulcers., METHODS: Forty seven patients were randomly allocated into PPI group and control group. Patients in PPI group received 40 mg of pantoprazole intravenously for 3 days after EVL, then 40 mg of oral pantoprazole for 11 days consecutively. Control patients received intravenous and oral placebo. Endoscopic examinations were performed twice at 7+/-2 days and 14+/-2 days after EVL respectively. Clinical outcomes include the size of ulcers, symptoms reported by patients; chest pain, dysphagia, and odynophagia., RESULTS: Forty seven patients completed the 7 days protocol (PPI/control; 25/22), and twenty six patients completed the 14 days protocol (PPI/control; 16/10). Post-EVL ulcers in PPI group were significantly smaller than those in control group (7 days; 98.7 mm2/119.4 m2, 14 days; 32.3 m2/43.8 m2, p<0.01). No difference was observed between two the groups with respect to summations of symptom scores (p> 0.05). Nineteen patients (PPI/control; 9/10) did not complete the 14 days protocol due to patients' refusal and adverse outcomes, such as hepatic failure and sepsis with bleeding from post-EVL ulcer occurred in two patients of control group., CONCLUSIONS: PPI treatment following EVL may be effective in healing post-EVL ulcer.",Excluded
2970,"Long-term survival and symptom palliation in small primary bronchial carcinomas following treatment with intraluminal radiotherapy alone. Between April 1988 and December 1992, 37 patients with small, previously unirradiated, primary non-small cell carcinomas of the bronchus causing symptoms due to endobronchial disease were treated at the Christie Hospital, Manchester, with a single fraction of high dose rate intraluminal radiotherapy (ILT) using the microSelectron-HDR machine. Small primary (SP) lesions were defined as being less than 2 cm in diameter in a direction perpendicular to the central axis of the iridium-192 treatment source. Fifteen patients (41%) were treated to a dose of 15 Gy and 22 patients (59%) to 20 Gy at a distance of 1 cm from the central axis of the source. At 6 weeks following ILT, improvement in symptoms was seen in the following percentages of patients: haemoptysis 96%, pulmonary collapse 69%, cough 55% and dyspnoea 52%. The magnitude of improvement in these symptoms was largely maintained in patients surviving to 4 months and then 12 months post-ILT. Median actuarial survival was 709 days, 2-year survival 49.4% and 5-year survival 14.1%. Overall, there was no significant difference in survival after treatment with 20 Gy compared with 15 Gy at 1 cm. At the close of study, there were four patients still alive without disease recurrence with survivals of 38, 48, 49 and 63 months. All had had biopsy-proven squamous cell carcinomas and all had been treated with 20 Gy at 1 cm. Five patients died from massive haemoptysis as a terminal event at 4, 9, 9, 10 and 11 months post-ILT, well below the median survival for this group of patients. Again, all had been treated with 20 Gy as opposed to 15 Gy at 1 cm. Over the same time period, 287 patients with non-small cell carcinomas of more than 2 cm in diameter (large primary lesions, LP), were treated with a single fraction of ILT only, as their initial treatment. A consistently greater percentage of patients with SP lesions showed an improvement in the symptoms of haemoptysis and pulmonary collapse when compared with patients with LP lesions. Patients with LP lesions demonstrated a decreased actuarial survival when compared with SP lesions, with median survival being 156 days, 2-year survival 3.1% and no survivors beyond 39 months. This study demonstrates that, in patients with small endobronchial carcinomas a single fraction of ILT can give efficient palliation of symptoms and lead to long term disease-free survival, but that a dose of 20 Gy may be at the limit of bronchial radiation tolerance for a single dose technique employing a high dose rate source.",Excluded
1545,"Therapy-related myelodysplasia and secondary acute myelogenous leukemia after high-dose therapy with autologous hematopoietic progenitor-cell support for lymphoid malignancies. Purpose: To evaluate the incidence of and risk factors for therapy- related myelodysplasia (tMDS) and secondary acute myelogenous leukemia (sAML), after high-dose therapy (HDT) with autologous bone marrow or peripheral-blood progenitor-cell support, in patients with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL). Patients and Methods: Between January 1985 and November 1996, 230 patients underwent HDT comprising cyclophosphamide therapy and total-body irradiation, with autologous hematopoietic progenitor-cell support, as consolidation of remission. With a median follow-up of 6 years, 27 (12%) developed tMDS or sAML. Result(s): Median time to development of tMDS or sAML was 4.4 years (range, 11 months to 8.8 years) after HDT. Karyotyping (performed in 24 cases) at diagnosis of tMDS or sAML revealed complex karyotypes in 18 patients. Seventeen patients had monosomy 5/5q-, 15 had - 7/7q-, seven had -18/18q-, seven had -13/13q-, and four had -20/20q-. Twenty- one patients died from complications of tMDS or sAML or treatment for tMDS or sAML, at a median of 10 months (range, 0 to 26 months). Sixteen died without evidence of recurrent lymphoma. Six patients were alive at a median follow-up of 6 months (range, 2 to 22 months) after diagnosis of tMDS or sAML. On multivariate analysis, prior fludarabine therapy (P = .009) and older age (P = .02) were associated with the development of tMDS or sAML. Increased interval from diagnosis to HDT and bone marrow involvement at diagnosis were of borderline significance (P = .05 and .07, respectively). Conclusion(s): tMDS and sAML are serious complications of HDT for NHL and are associated with very poor prognosis. Alternative strategies for reducing their incidence and for treatment are needed.

578,"Prevalence and expectations of ""alternative and complementary medicine"" use during radiotherapy in 2016: A prospective study. Purpose: Alternative and complementary medicine is defined as any substance or technique of non-allopathic medicine used to improve health and quality of life. The purpose of this prospective observational study was to evaluate the use of alternative and complementary medicine during radiotherapy. Material(s) and Method(s): A questionnaire was given the last week of treatment to all patients treated for breast cancer, prostate cancer or head and neck cancer in our centre in 2016. Result(s): In 2016, 132 patients were included. Fifty-seven patients (43%) used alternative and complementary medicine during radiotherapy, more women (61%) than men (35%) (P = 0.005). The use of alternative and complementary medicine varied according to locations: 44% of head and neck cancers, 57% of breast cancers and 24% of prostate cancers, but sex was the confounding factor. If alternative and complementary medicine was used before radiotherapy, 82% of patients used it during treatment, compared to 30% if they were naive (P < 10-7). Healing touch (68%), homeopathy (26%) and magnetisers (21%) were the most used alternative and complementary medicines. Sixty-one percent of patients used alternative and complementary medicine to reduce skin and mucosal side effects of treatments, 28% to improve well-being, and 9% to treat cancer. Seventy-two percent of all patients would advise their loved one to use an alternative and complementary medicine and 87% would like information about them in the hospital. Conclusion(s): Alternative and complementary medicines are used more by women, and by patients who used them before radiotherapy. The desired effects are mainly to reduce the side effects of the treatments. More than 80% of patients, whether or not they use alternative and complementary medicine, demand medical information.Copyright © 2018",Excluded

Objective: To study the cellular mechanisms involved in the regression of diabetic nephropathy, bone marrow-derived cells must be identified. The aim of this study was to obtain a diabetic chimeric model with bone marrow cells expressing enhanced green fluorecence protein (EGFP), without modifying the course of diabetic nephropathy. Material(s) and Method(s): Bone marrow transplantation (BMT) was performed in an obese type 2 diabetic murine model (db/db) owing to a mutation in the leptin receptor gene. Whole bone marrow from female donor C57BL/6 EGFP+ mice was transplanted into 8-week-old C57BL/6 mice and into 8- and 24-week-old female C57BLKS (db/db) EGFP- mice. Recipient mice received total body irradiation (TBI) followed by bone marrow (BM) cell infusion. We tested various irradiation doses (Gy) and numbers of BM cells. Result(s): When a low TBI dose and a small number of BM cells were administered, only syngeneic C57BL/6 mice became chimeric, whereas allogeneic db/db mice showed rejection. When Gy dose and BM cells were increased, db/db mice became chimeric. However, 8-week-old db/db mice lost the obese phenotype and became normoglycemic, probably due to peripheral BM cell infiltration. Conversely, 24-week-old db/db mice remained obese showing similar blood glucose values, body weights, albuminuria, and glomerular lesions at nontransplanted db/db mice. Conclusion(s): Recipient age greatly influenced the peripheral repopulation after BMT in db/db mice. Only the adult chimeric db/db mice seemed to be a good model to study the cellular mechanisms involved in the regression of diabetic nephropathy. © 2009 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.",Excluded
1884,"Radioiodide (131I) therapy for the treatment of canine thyroid carcinoma. OBJECTIVE: To assess the efficacy of radioactive iodine treatment (131I) for canine thyroid carcinoma, as both the sole therapeutic modality and as an adjunct to surgery. DESIGN: Retrospective analysis of case records from the Gladesville Veterinary Hospital Nuclear Medicine Service, Sydney, between August 1988 and December 2001. CASE DETAILS: The records of 65 dogs with thyroid carcinoma were analysed according to therapy and outcome. Forty-three dogs received radioiodide therapy, either as the sole therapeutic modality (32) or as an adjunct to surgery (11). Radioisotope therapy consisted of one to three doses of 131I with a dose range of 555 to 1850 MBq. For analysis, dogs were divided into groups according to therapy: no treatment, surgery alone, surgery with radioiodide therapy or radioiodide therapy alone. Mode of therapy, dosage of 131I, clinical staging and age were all independently analysed according to survival to compare efficacy or predictive value respectively. RESULT(S): When radioiodide therapy was used as an adjunct to surgery, median survival was 34 months. Censored median survival time for dogs that received radioiodide alone was 30 months. Dogs that did not receive treatment had a median survival of only 3 months. Log rank statistical analysis indicated that mode of therapy was significantly correlated with survival but that clinical stage of disease was not. CONCLUSION(S): The authors conclude that 131I therapy is effective at extending survival time, both as a sole therapeutic modality and as an adjunct to surgery, in dogs with invasive canine thyroid carcinoma. Incomplete surgical resection may not prolong survival in dogs also receiving 131I therapy, however surgical resection with curative intent should be recommended as the first line of therapy for mobile thyroid carcinomas. Radioisotope therapy can be recommended for cases where surgery alone is considered unlikely to be curative because of metastatic disease or local invasion, or for cases where surgery has been attempted but complete surgical removal has not been achieved.",Excluded

All computed tomography (CT) examinations were performed in two groups with the same tube voltage (100 kV), flow rate of contrast medium (5.0 mL/s), and iodine dose (22.8 g). An automatic mAs and low concentration contrast medium (300 mgI/mL) were used in group A, whereas effective mAs was reduced by a factor 0.6 along with HCCM (400 mgI/mL) in group B. Radiation dose was assessed (CT dose index [CTDIvol] and dose length product), and vessel-based objective IQ for various regions of interest (enhancement, noise, signal-to-noise ratio, and contrast-to-noise ratio), subjective IQ, noise, and motion artifacts were analyzed overall and vessel-based with a 5-point Likert scale., RESULTS: The CT attenuation of coronary arteries and image noise in group B were significantly higher than those in group A (ranges: 507.5-548.1 Hounsfield units vs 407.5-444.5 Hounsfield units; and 20.3 +/- 8.6 vs 17.7 +/- 8.0) (P <= 0.0166).

PURPOSE:Tocompare clinical outcome and tolerance of two types of treatments in elderly patients affected by newly diagnosed glioblastoma (GBM): temozolomide (TMZ) concurrent to conventional fractionated radiotherapy followed by adjuvant TMZ versus hypofractionated radiotherapy (RT) followed by adjuvant TMZ. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients older than 65 years with GBM, who underwent surgical resection/biopsy and treated with short-course radiotherapy or concurrent chemo-radiation therapy, were evaluated. Total doses were 25 or 60 Gy: 25 Gy in 5 fractions (palliative approach) and 60 Gy in 30 fractions (standard approach). In the standard approach, TMZ was administered concomitantly and adjuvantly to RT. RESULT(S): At the time of data analysis, 75 out 83 patients had died and the tumour progression was the primary cause of death in 71 patients. Median age was 70 years (range 65-82 yrs) with 39 females (46%) and 44 males (54%). Median KPS at time of treatment was 80. The surgery was gross total in 50 patients and subtotal in 8 patients; 25 patients underwent only biopsy. The O6-methylguanine-DNA-methyltransferase (MGMT) methylation status was reported in 55 patients (36 methylated and 19 unmethylated). No patients demonstrated clinically significant acute morbidity, and all patients were able to complete the prescribed radiation dose without interruption. As expected, the most common grade 3-4 adverse events in the standard therapy group were neutropenia (n = 3) and thrombocytopenia (n = 8). The prognostic factors analyzed were gender, age, extent of surgery, performance status before and after radiotherapy, hemoglobin and haematocrit level, and methylation of theMGMTgene. With median follow-up of 14.9 months, the medianOSand PFS were 16 and 8 versus 9 and 3 months, in Stupp arm and short course RT, respectively (p = 0.035 an p = 0.055). At Cox Proportional-Hazards Regression analysis, only the extent of surgery and high haemoglobin level correlated with OS and PFS; whereas age (<70 vs. >=70 years), KPS, diameter of lesion, MGMT methylation status and haematocrit level did not influenced outcome. CONCLUSION(S): Our data suggested that standard approach was and acceptably tolerated and prolonged survival of glioblastoma patients aged > or = 65 years. The extent of surgery remains independent prognostic factor. In this research, it was found that a low hemoglobin level before radiotherapy can adversely influence the prognosis of elderly patients with glioblastoma.",Excluded
1617,"Evaluation of functionally weighted dose-volume parameters for thoracic stereotactic ablative radiotherapy (SABR) using CT ventilation. For the purpose of reducing radiation pneumontisis (RP), four-dimensional CT (4DCT)-based ventilation can be used to reduce functionally weighted lung dose. This study aimed to evaluate the functionally weighted dose-volume parameters and to investigate an optimal weighting method to realize effective planning optimization in thoracic stereotactic ablative radiotherapy (SABR). Forty patients treated with SABR were analyzed. Ventilation images were obtained from 4DCT using deformable registration and Hounsfield unit-based calculation. Functionally-weighted mean lung dose (fMLD) and functional lung fraction receiving at least x Gy (fVx) were calculated by two weighting methods: thresholding and linear weighting. Various ventilation thresholds (5th-95th, every 5th percentile) were tested. The predictive accuracy for CTCAE grade2 pneumonitis was evaluated by area under the curve (AUC) of receiver operating characteristic analysis. AUC values varied from 0.459 to 0.570 in accordance with threshold and dose-volume metrics. A combination of 25th percentile threshold and fV30 showed the best result (AUC: 0.570). AUC values with fMLD, fV10, fV20, and fV40 were 0.541, 0.487, 0.548 and 0.563 using a 25th percentile threshold. Although conventional MLD, V10, V20, V30 and V40 showed lower AUC values (0.516, 0.477, 0.534, 0.552 and 0.527), the differences were not statistically significant. fV30 with 25th percentile threshold was the best predictor of RP.

OBJECTIVE: To study the effects of three different laser treatments (650 nm alone, 10.6 mum alone and combined laser of 650 nm and 10.6 mum) on experimental osteoarthritis of the knees in C57 black mice., METHODS: Sixty C57 black mice were divided randomly into 6 groups. Ten mice were assigned to a normal control group (no intervention) and the other 5 groups were subjected to a forced running regimen to induce osteoarthritis. One group was set as the model control group. The other 4 groups were given 90 s of a 650 nm laser, 90 s of a 10.6 mum laser, 90 s of a combined laser, or a sham treatment on acupoint Dubi (ST35) of the rear left leg 3 times per week for 4 weeks. The modified Mankin score was used to evaluate the degree of cartilage degradation. Immunohistochemical staining for heat shock protein (HSP) 70 was conducted., RESULTS: Mankin scores of the model control group and the sham control group were significantly higher than that of the normal control group (P<0.01). Mankin score of the combined laser group was significantly lower than that of the model control group (P<0.01). Compared with the normal control group, there was a significant induction of HSP70 in the arthritic chondrocytes of the combined laser group., CONCLUSION: The arthritic cartilage induced in C57 black mice improved significantly after combined laser treatment of 650 nm and 10.6 mum lasers. This effect may be related to the induction of HSP70 in the arthritic chondrocytes. The two different lasers appear to have a synergistic effect.",Excluded

OBJECTIVE: We determined the effect of reduced 80-kVp tube voltage on the radiation dose and image quality of coronary CT angiography (CTA) in patients with a normal body mass index (BMI)., SUBJECTS AND METHODS: A prospective, multicenter, multivendor trial was performed of 208 consecutive patients with a normal BMI (< 25 kg/m(2)) who had been referred for coronary CTA and did not have a history of coronary revascularization. Patients were randomized to 80-kVp imaging (n = 103) or 100-kVp imaging (n = 105). Three blinded readers graded interpretability and image quality. Study signal, noise, and contrast were also compared., RESULTS: Imaging with 80 kVp instead of 100 kVp was associated with 47% lower median radiation dose (median dose-length product, 62.0 mGy . cm [interquartile range, 54.0-123.3 mGy . cm] vs 117.0 mGy . cm [110.0-225.9 mGy . cm], respectively; 0.9 mSv [0.8-1.7 mSv] vs 1.6 mSv [1.4-3.2 mSv]; p < 0.001 for each) with no significant difference in interpretability (99% vs 99%; p = 0.99) or image quality (median score, 4.0 [interquartile range, 3.6-4.0] vs 4.0 [interquartile range, 3.8-4.0]; p = 0.20). Studies obtained using 80 kVp were associated with 27% increased signal (mean +/- SD, 756 +/- 157 vs 594 +/- 105 HU; p < 0.001), 25% higher contrast (890 +/- 156 vs 709 +/- 108 HU; p < 0.001), and 50% greater noise (55 +/- 15 vs 37 +/- 12 HU; p < 0.001) with resultant 15% and 16% decreases in signal-to-noise (mean +/- SD, 15 +/- 5 vs 17 +/- 5; p < 0.001) and contrast-to-noise (mean +/- SD, 17 +/- 6 vs 21 +/- 5; p < 0.001) ratios, respectively., CONCLUSION: Coronary CTA using 80 kVp instead of 100 kVp was associated with a nearly 50% reduction in radiation dose with no significant difference in interpretability and noninferior image quality despite lower signal-to-noise and contrast-to-noise ratios. The use of 80-kVp tube voltage should be considered in dose-reduction strategies for coronary CTA of individuals with a normal BMI.",Excluded
527,"Computer systems analysis of spaceflight induced changes in left ventricular mass. Circulatory adaptations resulting in postflight orthostasis have frequently been observed in response to space travel. It has been postulated that a decrement in left ventricular mass (LVM) found after microgravity exposure may be the central component in this cardiovascular deconditioning. However, a physiologic mechanism responsible for these changes in the myocardium has not been determined. In this study, we examined the sequential alterations in echocardiographic measured LVM from preflight to landing day and 3 days into the postflight recovery period. In a previous study in returning astronauts we found a comparative 9.1% reduction in postflight LVM that returned to preflight values by the third day of recovery. This data was further evaluated in a systems analysis approach using a well-established advanced computer model of circulatory functioning. The computer model incorporates the physiologic responses to changes in pressures, flows and hydraulics within the circulatory system as affected by gravitational forces. Myocardial muscle progression to atrophy or hypertrophy in reaction to the circulatory load conditions is also included in the model. The integrative computer analysis suggests that these variations in LVM could be explained by simple fluid shifts known to occur during spaceflight and can reverse within a few days after reentry into earth's gravity. According to model predictions, the reductions in LVM found upon exposure to microgravity are a result of a contraction of the myocardial interstitial fluid space secondary to a loss in the plasma volume. This hypothesis was additionally supported by the published ground-based study in which we followed the alterations in LVM and plasma volume in normal subjects in which hypovolemia was induced by simple dehydration. In the hypovolemic state, plasma volume was reduced in these subjects and was significantly correlated with echocardiographic measurements of LVM. Based on these experimental findings and the performance of the computer systems analysis it appears that reductions in LVM observed after spaceflight may be secondary to fluid exchanges produced by common physiologic mechanisms. Reductions in LVM observed after microgravity exposure have been previously postulated to be a central component of spaceflight-induced cardiovascular deconditioning. However, a recent study has demonstrated a return of astronauts' LVM to preflight values by the third day after landing through uncertain mechanisms. A systems analysis approach using computer simulation techniques allows for a dissection of the complex physiologic control processes and a more detailed examination of the phenomena. From the simulation studies and computer analysis it appears that microgravity induced reductions in LVM may be explained by considering physiologic fluid exchanges rather than cardiac muscle atrophy. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

1956,"Cumulative radiation dose from medical imaging procedures in patients undergoing resection for lung cancer. Background: Radiation dose from diagnostic imaging procedures is not monitored in patients undergoing surgery for lung cancer. Evidence suggests an increased lifetime risk of malignancy of 1.0% per 100 millisieverts (mSv). As such, recommendations are to restrict healthcare and radiation workers to a maximum dose of 50 mSv per year or to 100 mSv over a three-year period. The purpose of this study was to estimate cumulative effective doses of radiation in patients undergoing lung cancer resection and to determine predictors of increased exposure. Method(s): We identified 94 consecutive patients undergoing resection for non-small cell lung cancer. Radiologic procedures performed from one year prior to resection until two years postresection were recorded. Estimates of effective doses (mSv) were obtained from published literature and institutional records. Predictors of dose greater than 50 mSv per year and greater than 100 mSv per three years were examined statistically. Result(s): The majority of patients (median age = 67 years) had stage IA cancer (52%). In the three-year period, patients had 1,958 radiologic studies (20.8/patient) including 398 computed tomographic (CT) scans (4.23/patient) and 211 positron emission tomography (PET) scans (2.24 per patient). The three-year median estimated radiation dose was 84.0 mSv (interquartile range, 44.1 to 123.2 mSv). The highest dose was in the preoperative year. In any one year, 66% of patients received more than 50 mSv, while 19% received over 100 mSv. Over the three-year period, 43.6% of patients exceeded 100 mSv. The majority of the radiation (89.8%) was from CT or PET scans. On multivariate analysis, a history of previous malignancy (odds ratio [OR] 3.8; confidence interval [CI] 1.14 to 12.7), postoperative complications (OR 6.16; CI 1.42 to 26.6), and postoperative surveillance with PET-CT (OR 13.2; CI 4.34 to 40.3) predicted exposure greater than 100 mSv over the three-year period. Conclusion(s): This study demonstrates that lung cancer patients often receive a higher dose of radiation than that considered safe for healthcare and radiation workers. The median cumulative dose reported in this study could potentially increase the individual estimated lifetime cancer risk by as much as 0.8%. Although risk-benefit considerations are clearly different between these groups, strategies should be in place to decrease radiation doses during the preoperative workup and postoperative period. © 2011 The Society of Thoracic Surgeons.",Excluded
692,"MR-guided breast radiotherapy: feasibility and magnetic-field impact on skin dose. The UMC Utrecht MRI/linac (MRL) design provides image guidance with high soft-tissue contrast, directly during radiotherapy (RT). Breast cancer patients are a potential group to benefit from better guidance in the MRL. However, due to the electron return effect, the skin dose can be increased in presence of a magnetic field. Since large skin areas are generally involved in breast RT, the purpose of this study is to investigate the effects on the skin dose, for whole-breast irradiation (WBI) and accelerated partial-breast irradiation (APBI). In ten patients with early-stage breast cancer, targets and organs at risk (OARs) were delineated on postoperative CT scans co-registered with MRI. The OARs included the skin, comprising the first 5 mm of ipsilateral-breast tissue, plus extensions. Three intensity-modulated RT techniques were considered (2x WBI, 1x APBI). Individual beam geometries were used for all patients. Specially developed MRL treatment-planning software was used. Acceptable plans were generated for 0 T, 0.35 T and 1.5 T, using a class solution. The skin dose was augmented in WBI in the presence of a magnetic field, which is a potential drawback, whereas in APBI the induced effects were negligible. This opens possibilities for developing MR-guided partial-breast treatments in the MRL.",Excluded
3045,"Comparison of 6 MV and 18 MV photons for IMRT treatment of lung cancer. BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: To compare 6 MV and 18 MV photon intensity modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) for non-small cell lung cancer., MATERIALS AND METHODS: Doses for a cohort of 10 patients, typical for our department, were computed with a commercially available convolution/superposition (CS) algorithm. Final dose computation was also performed with a dedicated IMRT Monte Carlo dose engine (MCDE)., RESULTS: CS plans showed higher D(95%) (Gy) for the GTV (68.13 vs 67.36, p=0.004) and CTV (67.23 vs 66.87, p=0.028) with 18 than with 6 MV photons. MCDE computations demonstrated higher doses with 6 MV than 18 MV in D(95%) for the PTV (64.62 vs 63.64, p=0.009), PTV(optim) (65.48 vs 64.83, p=0.014) and CTV (66.22 vs 65.64, p=0.027). Dose inhomogeneity was lower with 18 than with 6 MV photons for GTV (0.08 vs 0.09, p=0.007) and CTV (0.10 vs 0.11, p=0.045) in CS but not MCDE plans. 6 MV photons significantly (D(33%); p=0.045) spared the esophagus in MCDE plans. Observed dose differences between lower and higher energy IMRT plans were dependent on the individual patient., CONCLUSIONS: Selection of photon energy depends on priority ranking of endpoints and individual patients. In the absence of highly accurate dose computation algorithms such as CS and MCDE, 6 MV photons may be the prudent choice.",Excluded
730,"Adult-to-adult living donor liver transplantation preoperative survey using MDCT, a single medical center experience in Taiwan. This study evaluated multi-detector computed tomography (MDCT) scans performed on potential living donors for adult-to-adult liver transplantation (LDLT), with the aim of identifying significant findings that could be used to exclude potential transplantation donors. We retrospectively reviewed the medical records of 151 consecutive potential adult donors for LDLT from May 2007 to January 2015. Liver parenchyma steatosis, focal hepatic mass or intraabdominal malignancy, vascular variations, and donor liver volume were evaluated via MDCT. Grounds for excluding potential donors were also recorded and analyzed. Of the 151 potential donors, nine (6.0%) had moderate to severe fatty liver, 37 (24.5%) had hepatic arterial variants, 22 (14.6%) had significant portal venous variants, and more than half were found to have right accessory inferior hepatic vein. No intraabdominal malignancies were found. Eighty-eight potential donors were rejected, with the most common cause being insufficient recipient volume or remnant donor volume (47.7%), moderate to severe parenchymal steatosis (10.2%), and recipient expiration prior to transplantation (8.0%). An additional 16 potential donors were excluded by the surgical team due to the complexity of their portal venous variations. The rate of exclusion by pre-transplant imaging evaluation with MDCT was 33.8%. MDCT can provide accurate quantification of donor liver volume and steatosis severity along with precise demonstration of vascular variants, which are crucial for the preoperative evaluation of LDLT. However, MDCT may be ineffective for evaluating the biliary system without hepatobiliary-excreted contrast agent and has the disadvantage of ionizing radiation.Copyright © 2017",Excluded

Fifty patients with acute renal colic and hematuria from February 2014 to February 2015 were enrolled. They underwent both MDCT and digital tomosynthesis. Images were interpreted by two experienced radiologists, and inter-reader agreement was assessed. The diagnostic performance of urinary stones with digital tomosynthesis and MDCT was compared. The entrance surface dose (ESD) in MDCT and digital tomosynthesis for patients was measured and compared. Result(s): No significant difference was found between digital tomosynthesis and MDCT in the diagnosis of urinary stones (X2 = 1.357, p > 0.05). The ESD in digital tomosynthesis was lower than that in both routine-dose and low-dose MDCT for patients (p < 0.05). Conclusion(s): Digital tomosynthesis has great diagnostic value in urolithiasis.

640,"The roles of Bcl-xL in modulating apoptosis during development of Xenopus laevis. BACKGROUND: Apoptosis is a common and essential aspect of development. It is particularly prevalent in the central nervous system and during remodelling processes such as formation of the digits and in amphibian metamorphosis. Apoptosis, which is dependent upon a balance between pro- and anti-apoptotic factors, also enables the embryo to rid itself of cells damaged by gamma irradiation. In this study, the roles of the anti-apoptotic factor Bcl-xL in protecting cells from apoptosis were examined in Xenopus laevis embryos using transgenesis to overexpress the XR11 gene, which encodes Bcl-xL. The effects on developmental, thyroid hormone-induced and gamma-radiation-induced apoptosis in embryos were examined in these transgenic animals., RESULTS: Apoptosis was abrogated in XR11 transgenic embryos. However, the transgene did not prevent the apoptotic response of tadpoles to thyroid hormone during metamorphosis. Post-metamorphic XR11 frogs were reared to sexual maturity, thus allowing us to produce second-generation embryos and enabling us to distinguish between the maternal and zygotic contributions of Bcl-xL to the gamma-radiation apoptotic response. Wild-type embryos irradiated before the mid-blastula transition (MBT) underwent normal cell division until reaching the MBT, after which they underwent massive, catastrophic apoptosis. Over-expression of Bcl-xL derived from XR11 females, but not males, provided partial protection from apoptosis. Maternal expression of XR11 was also sufficient to abrogate apoptosis triggered by post-MBT gamma-radiation. Tolerance to post-MBT gamma-radiation from zygotically-derived XR11 was acquired gradually after the MBT in spite of abundant XR11 protein synthesis., CONCLUSION: Our data suggest that Bcl-xL is an effective counterbalance to proapoptotic factors during embryonic development but has no apparent effect on the thyroid hormone-induced apoptosis that occurs during metamorphosis. Furthermore, post-MBT apoptosis triggered by irradiation before the MBT could only be restrained by maternal expression of Bcl-xL. Although maternal expression of XR11 was sufficient to abrogate apoptosis triggered by post-MBT gamma-radiation, radiation tolerance from zygotically-derived XR11 was acquired gradually, indicating that synthesis of XR11 protein is not sufficient to prevent apoptosis. Thus, repression of radiation-induced apoptosis by overexpression of Bcl-xL during embryonic development depends upon the timing of its expression and post-translational events that enable the protein to become effective.",Excluded
2614,"MRI-based cartilage thickness loss and joint space narrowing in an OAI core progression sample, and their relationship with age, sex, and BMI. Purpose: The aim of this study was 1) To determine the most sensitive measurement location in fixed flexion radiographs (JSW) and MRI (cartilage thickness; ThC), over 2 years, in a core sample of the OAI progression cohort; 2) To evaluate age, sex, and BMI as independent risk factors of structural progression at these locations. Method(s): One knee in each of 541 (224 men) OAI participants enrolled in the progression cohort was studied (all had frequent knee pain; 249 had KL GraDe 2; 292 had KL GraDe 3). Change in medial femorotibial JSW was measured automatically at 7 locations (fixed distances, FD) from PA fixed flexion radiographs, and change in ThC was measured in 16 femorotibial subregions after manually segmenting sagittal DESS images. The standardized response means (SRM) were used to determine the most sensitive measurement locations. Results were compared between men and women, and between the highest vs. lowest tertiles of age and BMI using t-tests, and general linear models with adjustment for the other variables. Beta coefficients (with 95% CI) and standardized beta (Z-scores) are presented. Result(s): In this OAI core sample, the FD 0.225 JSW location was the most sensitive X-ray measure (SRM = 0.40), and the central medial femoro-tibial compartment subregion (cMFTC.ThC) the most sensitive MRI measure for structural progression over two years (SRM = 0.48). Age tertiles studied were 66-79 yrs, vs. 45-56 yrs, and BMI tertiles 31.8-47.7 kg/m2 vs.18.2-27.7. Age, sex, and BMI explained only 2.6% of the variation in structural progression (R2 of adjusted model) in X-ray and 3.9% in MRI. With X-ray, BMI (beta = -0.198mm, 95% CI -0.333, -0.064, standard beta = -0.308) had a significant relationship with progression (Fig. 1), but neither age (adjusted p = 0.587) nor sex (p = 0.099) did. With MRI, high BMI (beta = -0.092mm, 95% CI -0.161, -0.023, standard beta = -0.278), high age (beta = -0.090mm, 95% CI -0.159, -0.021, standard beta = -0.270) and male sex (b= -0.099mm, 95% CI -0.156, -0.042, standard beta = -0.299) were all identified as significant risk factors for structural progression (Fig. 1). Conclusion(s): Measurement locations in the central aspect of the medial femorotibial compartment were most sensitive to structural progression for both imaging methodologies, with MRI providing slightly greater sensitivity to change than fixed flexion radiographs over 2 years. Age, sex, and BMI explained <4% of the variation in structural progression with both methodologies. All were significantly associated with progression as measured with MRI (where men surprisingly showed greater progression than women) while only BMI was associated with progression as measured by X-ray. Our data suggest that MRI may be more sensitive for identifying progression of medial compartment knee OA than plain radiographs. (Figure presented).",Excluded

Objective: The aim was to analyse the effect of the treatment of more than one infrapopliteal artery with respect to wound healing and limb salvage. Method(s): Seventy-eight patients were enrolled prospectively for 80 procedures (80 limbs) that were randomly divided into two groups: 40 in the single vessel (SV) group and 40 in the multiple vessel group (MV). All patients had tissue loss. The choice of the first artery to treat was based on an analysis of two factors: the ease of the required endovascular technique and the presence of adequate distal outflow. The randomisation point was after the first successful distal artery angioplasty. The primary endpoints were the wound healing rate and limb salvage. Result(s): The mean age of the patients was 69.1 +/- 4.3 years, and 56% were male. Concomitant treatment of the femoral and popliteal arteries was performed in 38.8% of patients. All demographic characteristics and technical aspects were statistically comparable for both groups. Successful recanalisation was achieved in 95.8%, 86.2%, 86.9%, and 92.5% for the tibio-fibular trunk, anterior tibial, posterior tibial, and fibular artery, respectively. In the MV group, a higher contrast volume (29 mL more; p =.049), longer procedure time (p =.01), and higher radiation exposure (p =.04) were noted. There was no difference in renal function between the groups either before or 30 days after the procedure (p =.165). The limb salvage rates after 1 and 3 years, respectively, were 75.9% and 67% for the SV group and 91.1% and 91.1% for the MV group (log rank p =.052). The wound healing rates after 1 and 3 years, respectively, were 33.6% and 70.9% for the SV and 63.9% and 78.4% for MV group (log rank p =.006). Wound healing was faster in MV (2.11 cm2/month) than SV group (0.62 cm2/month; p =.004). Conclusion(s): Endovascular treatment of more than one artery was associated with better wound healing rates but not with better limb salvage.Copyright © 2017 European Society for Vascular Surgery",Excluded
1641,"Organ transplant recipients and skin cancer: Assessment of risk factors with focus on sun exposure. SummaryBackground Organ transplant recipients (OTRs) have an increased risk of developing skin cancer, especially epithelial tumours. A number of factors such as immunosuppression, age, ultraviolet radiation and skin type are considered as important in aetiology. Objectives The purpose of this study was to further evaluate the risk factors for OTRs regarding skin cancer after transplantation. A detailed investigation of the specific compounds of sun exposure was realised. Methods A questionnaire-based study was performed in a specialist OTR dermatology clinic from January to April 2009. The subjects were 70 organ transplanted patients who had developed some form of skin cancer after transplantation. As controls served 69 organ transplanted patients who had no history of skin cancer. The controls were matched concerning age, transplanted organ and gender. Photo protection, sun exposure and transplantation data were part of the questionnaire. Statistical analysis was performed with Mann-Whitney-U-test, chi-square test or Fisher's exact test. Results The total sun burden (TSB) and the recreational sun exposure in particular attained higher scores in the skin cancer group (TSB-score: mean 11.8 vs. 10.0, P < 0.05; recreational sun exposure: mean 6.3 vs. 5.1, P < 0.05). The skin cancer group had fairer skin types than the control group (median skin type 2 vs. 3, P < 0.05). The OTRs who developed skin cancer have been more likely to have a history or present intake of azathioprine (mean 42% vs. 21%, P < 0.05). Also, the skin cancer group has been transplanted for a longer time (mean 12.3 vs. 7.2 years, P < 0.001), analogously had a younger age at transplantation (mean 49.5 vs. 52.7 years, P < 0.001). Conclusions Recreational sun exposure is of central importance for OTRs. A long period of transplantation and thus immunosuppression presents a main risk factor for the development of skin cancer in OTRs. A multi disciplinary management with the best medication and a focus on sun protection is needed to prevent skin cancer in OTRs. © 2009 British Association of Dermatologists.",Excluded
3390,"Influence of low-dose radiation on abscopal responses in patients receiving high-dose radiation and immunotherapy. BACKGROUND: Preclinical evidence suggests that low-dose radiation may overcome the inhibitory effects of the tumor stroma and improve a tumor's response to immunotherapy, when combined with high-dose radiation to another tumor. The aim of this study was to evaluate tumor responses to this combination in a clinical setting., METHODS: A post-hoc analysis of 3 ongoing immunoradiation trials was performed. Twenty-six (of 155) patients received low-dose radiation (1-20 Gy total), either as scatter from high-dose radiation or from intentional treatment of a second isocenter with low-dose radiation, were evaluated for response. The low-dose lesions were compared to lesions that received no radiation (< 1 Gy total). Response rates, both defined as complete and partial responses as defined by RECIST criteria were used to compare lesion types., RESULTS: The 26 patients had a total of 83 lesions for comparison (38 receiving low-dose, 45 receiving no-dose). The average dose given to low-dose lesions was 7.3 Gy (1.1-19.4 Gy), and the average time to response was 56 days. Twenty-two out of 38 (58%) low-dose lesions met the PR/CR criteria for RECIST compared with 8 out of 45 (18%) no-dose lesions (P = 0.0001). The median change for longest diameter size for low-dose lesions was - 38.5% compared to 8% in no-dose lesions (P < 0.0001). Among the low-dose lesions that had at least one no-dose lesion within the same patient as a control (33 and 45 lesions respectively), 12 low-dose lesions (36%) responded without a corresponding response in their no-dose lesions; Conversely, two (4%) of the no-dose lesions responded without a corresponding response in their low-dose lesion (P = 0.0004)., CONCLUSIONS: Low-dose radiation may increase systemic response rates of metastatic disease treated with high-dose radiation and immunotherapy.",Excluded
3289,"Acute and late toxicity of bilateral orbital irradiation in the management of primary intraocular lymphoma. Purpose/Objective(s): Primary intraocular lymphoma (PIOL) is a rare malignancy with poor outcomes. Data suggest that a combination of chemotherapy and orbital radiation therapy (RT) results in better ocular disease control and improved survival, compared to treatment with either modality alone. However, some clinicians withhold RT out of concern for toxicity, particularly vision-threatening retinopathy. We aimed to quantify the ocular toxicity of RT in PIOL patients treated uniformly with chemoimmunotherapy and RT. We hypothesized that vision-threatening complications would be rare. Materials/Methods: Eleven patients were identified who received sequential R-MPV (rituximab, methotrexate, procarbazine, and vincristine), RT, and high-dose cytarabine. Clinical information was collected from the electronic medical record. Result(s): The median age was 66 years (range 48-72). Two patients had diabetes; 1 had unilateral grade 1 diabetic retinopathy at presentation. RT targeted the bilateral orbits to a median dose of 36 Gy (range 30.6-39.6 Gy) with opposed tangential 6 MV photon beams (18%), intensity modulated RT (27%), or appositional 12-16 MeV electron beams with custom skin collimation (55%). A multidisciplinary team, including an ocular oncologist, followed patients for a median of 42 months after RT (range 8-94). Common adverse events included dermatitis (100%), conjunctivitis (82%), exophthalmia (64%), and keratopathy (45%). All phakic eyes developed cataracts (100%); cases that underwent subsequent cataract extraction maintained good visual acuity. New, visually significant retinopathy was observed in only 1 eye (<5%) and affected the only patient with pre-existing diabetic retinopathy. There was no case of radiationinduced optic neuropathy. At diagnosis, visual acuity was 20/40 or better in 15/22 eyes (68%). In the patients who did not experience an intraocular disease relapse, visual acuity at last follow-up was 20/40 or better in 9/16 eyes (56%); of note, poor vision at last follow-up was attributed to uncorrected cataracts in 4 eyes and therefore was considered correctable. Conclusion(s): This report suggests that severe, vision-threatening complications are uncommon following orbital RT and chemo-immunotherapy for PIOL. In the absence of comorbidities, orbital RT should not be withheld due to fear of vision-threatening toxicity. The risk of toxicity may be augmented by comorbidities, so an individualized approach is recommended.",Excluded
2257,"Residential radon exposure and lung cancer--an epidemiological study of Norwegian municipalities. The study is based on a collaboration between the Cancer Registry of Norway, the Norwegian Radiation Protection Authority, and National Radiological Protection Board (NRPB, UK). The association between indoor radon exposure and lung cancer was studied in 427 municipalities. NRPB detectors were sent to 10,000 households, and 7,500 of the detectors were returned. Data from a nation-wide survey of smoking habits in 1964-1965 were available. Data on asbestos exposure were also used in a regression analysis. The reporting to the Cancer Registry of all new cases of cancer is fairly complete, as hospital departments and institutes of pathology are obliged to report all cancer cases. The histologically confirmed lung cancer cases were grouped into squamous-cell carcinoma, small-cell carcinoma, adenocarcinoma and other or non-specified histological types. The age-adjusted rate of lung cancer by histological type was the dependent variable in the regression analysis. A consistent increase in incidence of lung cancer was seen with increasing tobacco consumption, but no positive trend could be shown with increasing radon exposure in the descriptive presentation of the data. In the regression analysis, however, the incidence of small-cell anaplastic lung tumors in females increased significantly with increasing radon exposure. When based on the regression coefficients, the fraction of lung cancers attributable to radon is about 2-4%.

Acute myocardial infarction (AMI) during pregnancy or the early postpartum period is rare, but can be devastating for both the mother and the fetus. There have been major advances in the diagnosis and treatment of acute coronary syndromes in the general population, but there is little consensus on the approach to diagnosis and treatment of pregnant women. This article reviews the literature relating to the pathophysiology of AMI in pregnant patients and the challenges in diagnosis and treatment of ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) in this unique population. From a cardiologist, maternal-fetal medicine specialist, and anesthesiologist's perspective, we provide recommendations for the diagnosis and management of STEMI occurring during pregnancy.

71,"7T MRI-Histologic Correlation Study of Low Specific Absorption Rate T2-Weighted GRASE Sequences in the Detection of White Matter Involvement in Multiple Sclerosis. BACKGROUND: The high value of the specific absorption rate (SAR) of radio-frequency (RF) energy arising from the series of RF refocusing pulses in T2-weighted (T2-w) turbo spin echo (TSE) MRI hampers its clinical application at 7.0 Tesla (7T). T2-w gradient and spin echo (GRASE) uses the speed from gradient refocusing in combination with the chemical-shift/static magnetic field (B0) inhomogeneity insensitivity from spin-echo refocusing to acquire T2-w images with a limited number of refocusing RF pulses, thus reducing SAR., OBJECTIVES: To investigate whether low SAR T2-w GRASE could replace T2-w TSE in detecting white matter (WM) disease in MS patients imaged at 7T., METHODS: The .7 mm3 isotropic T2-w TSE and T2-w GRASE images with variable echo times (TEs) and echo planar imaging (EPI) factors were obtained on a 7T scanner from postmortem samples of MS brains. These samples were derived from brains of 3 female MS patients. WM lesions (WM-Ls) and normal-appearing WM (NAWM) signal intensity, WM-Ls/NAWM contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR) and MRI/myelin staining sections comparisons were obtained., RESULTS: GRASE sequences with EPI factor/TE = 3/50 and 3/75 ms were comparable to the SE technique for measures of CNR in WM-Ls and NAWM and for detection of WM-Ls. In all sequences, however, identification of areas with remyelination, Wallerian degeneration, and gray matter demyelination, as depicted by myelin staining, was not possible., CONCLUSIONS: T2-w GRASE images may replace T2-w TSE for clinical use. However, even at 7T, both sequences fail in detecting and characterizing MS disease beyond visible WM-Ls. Copyright © 2015 by the American Society of Neuroimaging.",Excluded
2297,"Genotoxic effects of intermediate frequency magnetic fields on blood leukocytes in vitro. The widespread presence of electromagnetic sources in daily life has initiated several studies on the effects of radiofrequency and power frequency fields. Only few investigations on the genotoxic effects of exposure to intermediate frequency magnetic fields (IF-MF) have been done so far. Therefore, the aim of this study was to evaluate possible genotoxic effects of exposure to 123.90 kHz and 250.80 kHz IF-MF on canine and human blood. Blood was exposed to IF-MF at 630 A/m (0.79 mT) and 80 A/m (0.10 m T) with exposure durations of 1-5 h (hourly), 20 and 24 h. Cylindrically divided Petri dish system was developed for in vitro exposures where different induced current could be achieved in the samples at the same magnetic flux density level. For the assessment of genotoxicity the alkaline comet assay was applied. We detected a statistically significant increase in DNA damage only following 20 h exposure to IF-MF.

251,"Use of 120 kilovolt tube potential for digital subtraction angiography and fluoroscopy in an image-intensifier angiographic system: Decrease of skin dose in transarterial chemoembolization therapy for hepatocellular carcinoma. In an image-intensifier angiographic system, the tube potential is commonly regulated in ranges from 75 to 90 kV for digital subtraction angiography (DSA) and fluoroscopy in transarterial chemoembolization therapy (TACE) for hepatocellular carcinoma. The purpose of this study was to investigate whether or not a 120-kV tube potential could be used for DSA and fluoroscopy in TACE to decrease the skin dose. Forty-three patients administered TACE were randomly allocated into two groups: TACE was performed using standard-kilovoltage (75- to 90-kV) DSA and fluoroscopy modes (group A; n = 20) or using high-kilovoltage (120-kV) modes (group B; n = 23). The peak skin dose was compared between the groups. One case in group A was excluded from the study because the HCC nodule was not depicted on DSA. The peak skin dose (mGy) for group A was 383.6 +/- 176.5 and that for group B was 265.1 +/- 145.1. The peak skin dose was decreased by 31% in the 120-kV mode, a statistically significant difference (t-test, p = 0.022). We conclude that the use of 120 kV tube potential for DSA and fluoroscopy may be one option for performing TACE while decreasing the skin dose. © 2007 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.",Excluded
1491,"What are the clinical and technical factors that influence the kerma-area product in percutaneous coronary intervention?. The purpose of the paper is to define predictors of the kerma-area product (KAP) in percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). Two new digital X-ray interventional cardiology systems recently installed were included. A total of 398 PCI procedures were carried out by 6 board-certified senior interventional cardiologists with more than 15 years' experience and good knowledge of radiation protection measures. Clinical, radiation and procedural data were collected based on a detailed protocol developed by the SENTINEL cardiology subgroup. Correlation with clinical and procedure factors was then investigated. A significant correlation was found between fluoroscopy time and (i) lesion classification, (ii) the level of tortuosity and (iii) the number of vessels treated. No statistically significant differences were observed in the complexity of the case between operators. However, large differences were found in the KAP among operators, which were mostly attributed to the different number of frames taken by each operator. There was no statistically significant correlation between complexity and the total number of frames. The study showed that, in certain circumstances, the clinical need to successfully perform PCI takes precedence over radiation safety concerns.",Excluded

Radiation exposure of radiologists' left and right hands during 44 percutaneous drainages involving fluoroscopy was measured with thermoluminescent dosimeters. Finger doses of 3.4-1,300 microGy (mean 180, median 110) were recorded. Finger exposure seemed to show a significant, positive correlation with the screening time, but not with the patients' body mass indexes or ages. The mean personal doses of the radiologists were different and, in one case, the difference between the individual radiologists' doses was statistically significant. The personal working technique may therefore partly explain the amount of radiation exposure to the fingers.",Excluded
258,"Assessment of quality of life and oral function of patients participating in a phase II study of radioprotection of oral and pharyngeal mucosa by the prostaglandin E(1) analog misoprostol (RTOG 96-07). PURPOSE: The oral complications associated with radiotherapy to the head and neck are a significant dose-limiting factor. The goals of this study were to determine whether oropharyngeal rinsing and ingestion of misoprostol protect mucous membranes from the acute effects of irradiation, and to evaluate the quality-of-life (QOL) outcomes of patients receiving misoprostol. We report the results of the QOL outcomes of patients in this study., METHODS AND MATERIALS: A total of 33 patients with resected or intact cancer of the oral cavity, oropharynx, supraglottic larynx, or hypopharynx were registered to receive postoperative radiotherapy plus misoprostol or primary radiotherapy plus misoprostol. All patients were scheduled to receive 60-70 Gy at 2 Gy/d within 6-7 weeks. QOL and function were evaluated., RESULTS: A decrease in the QOL and function occurred in all areas covered by the questionnaire at the 6-week interval. This decrease was significant for eating, saliva, taste, and mucous. Of these significant factors, taste, saliva, and mucous consistency had not resolved by 12 weeks., CONCLUSION: Increased understanding of the impact of treatment on QOL and symptoms will formulate the rational design of toxicity interventions and enhance the multidisciplinary care of head-and-neck patients.",Excluded
957,"Intraoperative radiotherapy as adjuvant treatment for stage II/III rectal carcinoma. In recent years, many efforts have focused on combined radiotherapy and chemotherapy as adjuvants to curative surgery in patients with stage II and III (UICC) rectal carcinomas. Intraoperative radiotherapy (IORT) makes it possible to increase the total irradiation dose in a locally restricted area while sparing normal mobile organs, but it is limited by increased late toxicity. A prospective phase I/II study was designed to evaluate the efficacy of moderate-dose intraoperative and external beam radiotherapy (IO-EBRT), in some cases with concomitant chemotherapy. Sixty-three patients with a stage II or III rectal carcinoma were eligible for analysis (median follow-up 30.6 months). Fifty-four patients had undergone a complete resection (RO). Mean IORT dose was 11.3 Gy and mean EBRT dose 41.4 Gy. In 45 patients (71.4%) concomitant chemotherapy was delivered (5-FU, leucovorin). Two patients suffered local failure. However, overall local tumor control was markedly improved compared to historical controls (96.8% vs 66.2%). Patients treated with IO-EBRT showed a reduced incidence of distant metastases after concomitant chemotherapy (17.6% vs 38.8%). A 4-year actuarial relapse-free survival of 82% was obtained after IO-EBRT plus chemotherapy, and 59% after IO-EBRT alone. The postoperative course was unremarkable in 47.6% of patients. No radiation colitis or neuropathy occurred. Moderate-dose IORT and EBRT is safe, taking into account related late toxicities. It is an effective local treatment approach, resulting in an encouraging local control rate.",Excluded
2411,"Human dosimetry and preliminary tumor distribution of 18F- fluoropaclitaxel in healthy volunteers and newly diagnosed breast cancer patients using PET/CT. 18F-fluoropaclitaxel is a radiolabeled form of paclitaxel, a widely used chemotherapy agent. Preclinical data suggest that 18F-fluoropaclitaxel may be a reasonable surrogate for measuring the uptake of paclitaxel. As a substrate of P-glycoprotein, a drug efflux pump associated with multidrug resistance, 18F-fluoropaclitaxel may also be useful in identifying multidrug resistance and predicting tumor response for drugs other than paclitaxel. Method(s): After informed consent was obtained, 3 healthy volunteers and 3 patients with untreated breast cancer (neoadjuvant chemotherapy candidates, tumor size > 2 cm) received an intravenous infusion of 18F-fluoropaclitaxel and then underwent PET/CT. Healthy volunteers underwent serial whole-body imaging over an approximately 3-h interval, and organ 18F residence times were determined from the time-activity curves uncorrected for decay to determine dosimetry. Radiation dose estimates were calculated using OLINDA/EXM software. For breast cancer patients, dynamic imaging of the primary tumor was performed for 60 min, followed by static whole-body scans at 1 and 2 h after injection. Result(s): Dosimetry calculations showed that the gallbladder received the highest dose (229.50 muGy/MBq [0.849 rad/mCi]), followed by the small and large intestines (161.26 muGy/MBq [0.597 rad/mCi] and 184.59 muGy/MBq [0.683 rad/mCi]). The resultant effective dose was 28.79 muGy/MBq (0.107 rem/mCi). At approximately 1 h after injection, an average of 42% of the decay-corrected activity was in the gastrointestinal system, with a mean of 0.01% in the tumor. All 3 breast cancer patients showed retention of 18F-fluoropaclitaxel and ultimately demonstrated a complete pathologic response (no invasive cancer in the breast or axillary nodes) to chemotherapy that included a taxane (either paclitaxel or docetaxel) at surgical resection. The tumor-to-background ratio increased with time to a maximum of 7.7 at 20 min. Conclusion(s): This study demonstrates the feasibility of using 18F-fluoropaclitaxel PET/CT tumor imaging and provides radiation dosimetry measurements in humans. Although further study is needed, it is hoped that the measured intratumoral 18F-fluoropaclitaxel distribution can serve as a surrogate for paclitaxel, and potentially other chemotherapeutic agent retention, in solid tumors.

319,"The consequences of treatment and disease in patients with primary CNS non-Hodgkin's lymphoma: cognitive function and performance status. North Central Cancer Treatment Group. Per protocol, patients with primary CNS non-Hodgkin's lymphoma in an intergroup phase II trial conducted by the North Central Cancer Treatment Group and the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group had their cognitive functions measured using the Folstein and Folstein Mini-Mental Status Examination (MMSE) and their physical functions measured using the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group Performance Score (PS) at study entry, at each treatment evaluation, and at quarterly intervals thereafter until disease progression or death. Of the 53 eligible participants who began therapy, 46 (87%) had baseline MMSE scores recorded, 36 (68%) had at least one follow-up MMSE, and 32 (60%) had both, while 52 (98%) had baseline PS, 49 (92%) had at least one follow-up PS, and 48 (91%) had both. Patterns of MMSE and PS values over time were studied in each individual, in the group as a whole, in the 20 patients who completed the study regimen, in the 23 who survived more than a year, and in patients who were classified as nonprogressors at each key evaluation. For each patient, all recorded values were plotted versus time, with dates of disease progression and death included, to look for signs of decline in cognitive or physical function preceding adverse events. Long-term declines in scores of both cognitive and physical function were observed in many treated patients with primary CNS non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. Nearly all patients who were alive more than 52 weeks after study entry had a demonstrable decline in cognitive and physical functionality. Such declines may occur before disease progression is documented; they may also occur in some patients who have long-term follow-up without evidence of disease progression. Declining MMSE and PS was a poor predictor of disease progression. There was no association of PS and toxicity. The data from this study demonstrated the considerable difficulties we encountered conducting an ancillary study such as this within a multicenter clinical trial. Firstly, the test instruments written into the protocol were unable to tell if the declines seen were due to disease, treatment, co-morbidity, or other factors. Secondly, the missing data created difficulties in interpreting outcome.",Excluded
2334,"Generation of boundary manikin anthropometry. The purpose of this study was to develop 3D digital 'boundary manikins' that are representative of the anthropometry of a unique population. These digital manikins can be used by designers to verify and validate that the components of the spacesuit design satisfy the requirements specified in the Human Systems Integration Requirements (HSIR) document. Currently, the HSIR requires the next generation space suit to accommodate the 1st percentile American female to the 99th percentile American male. The manikin anthropometry was derived using two methods: Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Whole Body Posture Based Analysis (WBPBA). PCA is a statistical method for reducing a multidimensional data set by using eigenvectors and eigenvalues. The goal was to create a reduced data set that encapsulates the majority of the variation in the population. WBPBA is a multivariate analytical approach that was developed by the Anthropometry and Biomechanics Facility (ABF) to identify the extremes of a population for a given body posture. WBPBA is a simulation-based method that finds extremes in a population based upon anthropometry and posture; whereas PCA is based solely on anthropometry. Both methods yielded a list of subjects and their anthropometry from a target population; PCA resulted in 20 female and 22 male subjects' anthropometry and WBPBA resulted in 7 subjects' anthropometry representing the extreme subjects in the target population. The subjects' anthropometry was then used to 'morph' a baseline digital scan of a person with the same body type to create a 3D digital model that can be used as a tool for designers.

3709,"3D histomorphometric quantification of trabecular bones by computed microtomography using synchrotron radiation. Conventional bone histomorphometry is an important method for quantitative evaluation of bone microstructure. X-ray computed microtomography is a non-invasive technique, which can be used to evaluate histomorphometric indices in trabecular bones (BV/TV, BS/BV, Tb.N, Tb.Th, Tb.Sp). In this technique, 3D images are used to quantify the whole sample, differently from the conventional one, in which the quantification is performed in 2D slices and extrapolated for 3D case. In this work, histomorphometric quantification using synchrotron 3D X-ray computed microtomography was performed to quantify the bone structure at different skeletal sites as well as to investigate the effects of bone diseases on quantitative understanding of bone architecture. The images were obtained at Synchrotron Radiation for MEdical Physics (SYRMEP) beamline, at ELETTRA synchrotron radiation facility, Italy. Concerning the obtained results for normal and pathological bones from same skeletal sites and individuals, from our results, a certain declining bone volume fraction was achieved. The results obtained could be used in forming the basis for comparison of the bone microarchitecture and can be a valuable tool for predicting bone fragility. Copyright © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

Twenty-eight patients with osteoporotic vertebral compression fractures (OVCF) were treated with single-balloon bipedicular kyphoplasty (Group A), and 40 patients were treated with double-balloon bipedicular kyphoplasty (Group B). Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) score, vertebral height, and kyphotic angle (KA) were evaluated pre-operatively, post-operatively (3 days after surgery) and at final follow-up. Operative time, X-ray exposure frequency and costs were recorded. The mean operative time and X-ray exposure frequency in Group A were greater than in Group B (p < 0.05). Significant improvement of the VAS score was noted in each group, and remained unchanged at final follow-up. Mean increases of anterior and middle height of the fractured vertebral body were 5.14 mm and 4.14 mm in Group A, respectively, and 6.22 mm and 5.06 mm in Group B, respectively, and the differences between the groups were statistically significant (p < 0.05). Mean reduction of KA was 6.9degree in Group A and 8.8degree in Group B, which was statistically significant (p < 0.05). No statistically significant difference was observed in terms of cement leakage between groups. The mean cost of Group A (US$4202) was significantly less than that of Group B (US$6220) (p < 0.001). Single-balloon bipedicular kyphoplasty is a safe and cost-effective surgical method for the treatment of OVCF. It can achieve pain relief comparable with double-balloon bipedicular kyphoplasty. However, double-balloon bipedicular kyphoplasty is more efficacious in terms of the restoration of vertebral height and reduction of KA, and the operative time and X-ray exposure frequency are lower.Copyright © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

3635,"Radiation dose and image quality in pediatric chest CT: effects of iterative reconstruction in normal weight and overweight children. BACKGROUND: New CT reconstruction techniques may help reduce the burden of ionizing radiation. OBJECTIVE: To quantify radiation dose reduction when performing pediatric chest CT using a low-dose protocol and 50% adaptive statistical iterative reconstruction (ASIR) compared with age/gender-matched chest CT using a conventional dose protocol and reconstructed with filtered back projection (control group) and to determine its effect on image quality in normal weight and overweight children. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed 40 pediatric chest CT (M:F = 21:19; range: 0.1-17 years) in both groups. Radiation dose was compared between the two groups using paired Student's t-test. Image quality including noise, sharpness, artifacts and diagnostic acceptability was subjectively assessed by three pediatric radiologists using a four-point scale (superior, average, suboptimal, unacceptable). RESULTS: Eight children in the ASIR group and seven in the control group were overweight. All radiation dose parameters were significantly lower in the ASIR group (P < 0.01) with a greater than 57% dose reduction in overweight children. Image noise was higher in the ASIR group in both normal weight and overweight children. Only one scan in the ASIR group (1/40, 2.5%) was rated as diagnostically suboptimal and there was no unacceptable study. CONCLUSION: In both normal weight and overweight children, the ASIR technique is associated with a greater than 57% mean dose reduction, without significantly impacting diagnostic image quality in pediatric chest CT examinations. However, CT scans in overweight children may have a greater noise level, even when using the ASIR technique.",Excluded
386,"Straylight effects with aging and lens extraction. PURPOSE: To assess possible gains and losses in straylight values among the population to consider straylight as added benefit of lens extraction., DESIGN: In this cross-sectional design, data from a multicenter study on visual function in automobile drivers were analyzed., METHODS: On both eyes of 2,422 subjects, visual acuity (logarithm of the minimum angle of resolution [logMAR] in steps of 0.02 log units), straylight on the retina (psychophysical compensation comparison method), and lens opacity (slit-lamp scoring using the Lens Opacities Classification System III [LOCS III] system) were determined. Three groups were defined: 220 pseudophakic eyes, 3,182 noncataractous eyes (average LOCS III score, <1.5), and 134 cataractous eyes (average LOCS III score, >3.0)., RESULTS: Noncataractous straylight values increases strongly with age as: log(s) = constant + log(1 + (age / 65)(4)), doubling by the age of 65 years, and tripling by the age of 77 years. Population standard deviation around this age norm was approximately 0.10 log units. The cataract eyes (in this active driver group) had relatively mild straylight increase. In pseudophakia, straylight values may be very good, better even than in the noncataract group. Visual acuity and straylight were found to vary quite independently., CONCLUSIONS: Lens extraction holds promise not only to improve on the condition of the cataract eye, but also to improve on the age-normal eye. Lens extraction potentially reverses the strong age increase in straylight value, quite independently from visual acuity.",Excluded

UNLABELLED: Radiosynoviorthesis (RSO) with the ss-particle-emitting nuclide yttrium-90 is an established concept for the treatment of persistent synovitis of the knee joint. The AIM of this study was to investigate the biological radiation effect on the basis of a characteristic radiation parameter., PATIENTS, METHODS: After RSO procedures with yttrium-90 citrate colloid and subsequent immobilisation of the knee, blood specimens of 10 patients were collected immediately before RSO and 11 to 13 days after the intervention. The yield of dicentric chromosomes in the lymphocytes was determined exclusively in metaphases of the first cell cycle in vitro. In addition, activity leakage was measured by wholebody bremsstrahlung-scintigraphy., RESULTS: No statistically significant increase in the number of dicentric chromosomes (26 before treatment and 34 after treatment) in 20 192 cells analyzed from the 20 blood samples could be found as a result of RSO. However, the analysis of at least 1000 cells per blood sample demonstrates a tendency for a biological radiation effect in the blood of patients on the basis of this characteristic radiation parameter. Two of the 10 RSO patients had undergone a second RSO using yttrium-90 citrate, whereby one patient displayed activity transport out of the knee joint, amounting to 6 MBq. Only for him a radiation effect (about 130 mGy per single RSO) could be calculated by biological dosimetry., CONCLUSION: Since in general, based on the analysis of dicentric chromosomes in at least 1000 lymphocytes per individual, detection limits for groups of persons after long-term exposures to low-LET radiation of 50-100 mGy are possible, we assume that RSO with yttrium-90 should be associated with a low whole-body radiation exposure.",Excluded
1173,"The role of thiols in cellular response to radiation and drugs. Cellular nonprotein thiols (NPSH) consist of glutathione (GSH) and other low molecular weight species such as cysteine, cysteamine, and coenzyme A. GSH is usually less than the total cellular NPSH, and with thiol reactive agents, such as diethyl maleate (DEM), its rate of depletion is in part dependent upon the cellular capacity for its resynthesis. If resynthesis is blocked by buthionine-S,R-sulfoximine(BSO), the NPSH, including GSH, is depleted more rapidly, Cellular thiol depletion by diamide, N-ethylmaleimide, and BSO may render oxygenated cells more sensitive to radiation. These cells may or may not show a reduction in the oxygen enhancement ratio (OER). Human A549 lung carcinoma cells depleted of their NPSH either by prolonged culture or by BSO treatment do not show a reduced OER but do show increased aerobic responses to radiation. Some nitroheterocyclic radiosensitizing drugs also deplete cellular thiols under aerobic conditions. Such reactivity may be the reason that they show anomalous radiation sensitization (i.e., better than predicted on the basis of electron affinity). Other nitrocompounds, such as misonidazole, are activated under hypoxic conditions to radical intermediates. When cellular thiols are depleted peroxide is formed. Under hypoxic conditions thiols are depleted because metabolically reduced intermediates react with GSH instead of oxygen. Thiol depletion, under hypoxic conditions, may be the reason that misonidazole and other nitrocompounds show an extra enhancement ratio with hypoxic cells. Thiol depletion by DEM or BSO alters the radiation response of hypoxic cells to misonidazole. In conclusion, we propose an altered thiol model which includes a mechanism for thiol involvement in the aerobic radiation response of cells. This mechanism involves both thiol-linked hydrogen donation to oxygen radical adducts to produce hydroperoxides followed by a GSH peroxidase-catalyzed reduction of the hydroperoxides to intermediates entering into metabolic pathways to produce the original molecule.",Excluded

To analyze the tritium internal exposure dose of workers in the Third Qinshan Nuclear Power Plant over the past 15 years. Urine samples provided by workers are tested directly to analyze the tritium concentrations and estimate internal exposure dose. Since 2004, an average of approximately 1600 workers have been monitored annually, with an average annual monitoring frequency of approximately 11 000. Since 2004, the average annual collective dose of tritium internal exposure was 149.62 person.mSv, accounting for 19.07% of the total annual collective dose. A total of 18 workers' annual individual internal tritium radiation doses exceeded 2 mSv, of which 5 workers' internal tritium radiation doses in a single intake exceeded 2 mSv. The occupational population with the largest total internal tritium radiation doses consists of maintenance personnel, fuel operators, and radiation protection personnel, whose collective doses of internal exposure account for 75.51% of the total collective doses within the plant.

2016,"Oxygen consumption during walking and running under fractional weight bearing conditions. INTRODUCTION: Knowledge of changes in oxygen consumption during reduced body weight loading at different speed levels is important, in particular in astronauts who may lose aerobic fitness as well as in clinical patients (e.g., in obese individuals at walking speeds or in injured athletes at running speeds). Therefore, the aim of this study was to analyze oxygen consumption during unloaded walking and running., METHODS: Oxygen consumption (Vo2), heart rate (HR), and Borg rating of perceived exertion (Borg RPE) were quantified in 10 healthy young female and male volunteers at 3 body weight (BW) conditions (100%, 66%, and 33% BW) and 4 treadmill speeds (slow walking at 0.4 m x s(-1), comfortable walking at 1.3 m x s(-1), slow running at 2.2 m x s(-1), and moderately fast running at 3.1 m x s(-1)). Unloading was achieved in a waist-high chamber with increased pressure called Lower Body Positive Pressure (LBPP)., RESULTS: All parameters (Vo2, HR, and Borg RPE) decreased during unloaded walking and running. Interestingly, our findings confirm a specific linear relationship between each parameter and treadmill speed for each BW condition with smaller slope angles at higher levels of unloading (e.g., for Vo2, the slope angle decreased from 11.9 at 100% BW to 4.4 at 33% BW)., DISCUSSION: Oxygen consumption, heart rate, and Borg rating of perceived exertion are reduced during unloaded exercise with a relatively greater decline at higher treadmill speeds. That is, the higher the treadmill's speed in unloaded conditions, the relatively easier"" it is to exercise.""",Excluded
73,"Sunscreen protection against cis-urocanic acid production in human skin. Commercial sunscreens may offer some protection from immunosuppression induced by ultraviolet (UV) radiation, but agreement concerning the degree of protection is lacking. Cis-urocanic acid, formed by the photoisomerization of transurocanic acid is considered an important mediator of the cutaneous immunomodulation resulting from exposure to UV radiation. We investigated the effect of sunscreens on the isomerization of urocanic acid in 17 human subjects. Two sunscreens containing chemical filters, sun protection factor (SPF) 4 and SPF 10, and a SPF 10 sunscreen with a physical filter were applied at a thickness of 2 mg/cm2. The effect of a thin layer (0.5 mg/cm2) of the chemical SPF 10 sunscreen was also evaluated, as the amount of sunscreen applied in practice may be considerably less than recommended. All areas were irradiated with a single UV dose of 3.6 SED (standard erythema doses). In irradiated unprotected skin the median net production of cis-urocanic acid was 52% (relative amount). In the sites treated with the chemical sunscreens, the production of cis-urocanic acid was 7.4% (SPF 4) and 3.5% (SPF 10), and isomerization was thus reduced more efficiently at a higher SPF (p<0.01). The physical sunscreen reduced the formation of cis-UCA to 15%, and was significantly less effective than both the chemical SPF 10 sunscreen (p<0.01) and the SPF 4 sunscreen (p<0.01). The production of cis-urocanic acid in the area treated with the thin layer of the chemical SPF 10 sunscreen was 22%. The protection against the production of cis-urocanic acid was therefore reduced significantly (p<0.01) when the sunscreen was applied in an amount lower than recommended.",Excluded
2265,"Minimal erythema dose (MED) in normal canine skin by irradiation of narrow-band ultraviolet B (NB-UVB). Narrow-band UVB (NB-UVB) is light over a very narrow band of wavelengths (around 311 nm) that is concentrated in the therapeutic range and minimally in the sunburn range. It has therefore become the phototherapy treatment of choice for skin diseases. The minimal erythema dose (MED) on canine skin for standardizing dosage schedules in NB-UVB treatment and histopathological analyses were performed in these dogs. In all 32 dogs tested, the MED ranged from 432 to 864 mJ/cm2. There were no significant differences in MED among breeds, sex and age groups. Histopathology obtained from areas irradiated by MED showed only mild vascular dilatation. These findings might be valuable for the application of NB-UVB phototherapy to canine skin diseases. © 2013 The Japanese Society of Veterinary Science.",Excluded

When there was agreement between at least two technologists (57 studies), the rates fell to 4% and 21% respectively., CONCLUSIONS: Technologists could make the decision to avoid a resting study in up to 30% of patients following a normal low-dose stress acquisition. The supervising nuclear cardiologist would disagree in perhaps one in five cases, even when there was consensus between two or more technologists. These patients would suffer minor inconvenience by being recalled for a rest acquisition on a second day, but there would be important savings in time and radiation exposure for the majority.",Excluded
2864,"Low-dose high-pitch CT angiography of the supraaortic arteries using sinogram-affirmed iterative reconstruction. Objective: To prospectively evaluate image quality and radiation dose using a low-dose computed tomography angiography protocol and iterative image reconstruction for high-pitch dual-source CT-angiography (DSCTA) of the supraaortic arteries. Material(s) and Method(s): DSCTA was performed in 42 patients, using either 120 kVp tube voltage, 120 mAS tube current, 2.4 pitch and filtered back projection, or 100 kVp tube voltage, 100 mAs tube current, 3.2 pitch, and sinogram affirmed iterative reconstruction. Measurements of vessel attenuation, of the contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR) and the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) were performed to objectively evaluate image quality. Two readers evaluated subjective image quality and image noise, using a four-point scale. Effective dose was used to compare the differences in radiation dose. Result(s): Low-dose protocol application showed significantly higher vessel opacification (p = 0.013), and non-significantly higher CNR and SNR values. There was no difference in the subjective image quality and image noise reading between the protocols. Effective dose was significantly lower using the low-dose protocol (1.29+/-0.21 mSv vs. 2.92+/-0.72 mSv; p<0.001). Conclusion(s): The combined use of reduced tube voltage, reduced tube current, and iterative reconstruction reduces radiation dose by 55.4% in high-pitch DSCTA of the supraaortic arteries without impairment of image quality. © 2014 Beitzke et al.",Excluded
1058,"Radiotherapy in elderly patients with inoperable esophageal cancer. Is there a benefit?. BACKGROUND: Radiation oncologists increasingly face elderly cancer patients impaired by comorbidities and reduced performance status. As less data are available for this particular group of patients, the aim of the study was to assess the prognosis of inoperable esophageal cancer patients >= 70 years undergoing definitive radiotherapy or radiochemotherapy. PATIENTS AND TREATMENT PROTOCOL: Patients aged >= 70 with inoperable carcinoma of the esophagus undergoing definitive radio(chemo)therapy between 1995 and 2006 at the University of Cologne were included retrospectively. Maximal total dose of radiotherapy administered was 63 Gy (5 x 1.8 Gy/week). Chemotherapy consisted of cisplatin (20 mg/m(2) on days 1-5 and days 29-33) and 5-fluorouracil (650-1,000 mg/m(2) on days 1-5 and days 29-33). Efficacy was compared with a cohort of 152 patients < 70 years treated with the same protocol during the same time period., RESULTS: A total of 51 patients aged >= 70 with inoperable cancer of the esophagus undergoing definitive therapy were identified (stage I/II 23.5%, stage III 56.9%, stage IV 9.8%; squamous cell carcinoma 74.5%, adenocarcinoma 25.5%). While 15 patients (29.4%) received combined radiochemotherapy (RCT), 40 patients (70.6%) were treated with radiotherapy alone (RT). Median progression-free survival (PFS) was 9.5 months; median overall survival (OS) was 13.9 months. Patients treated with RCT had a 2-year OS rate of 53.3% compared with 16.7% for RT patients (p = 0.039). The 2-year OS for clinically lymph node negative patients was 38.5% compared with 21.2% for lymph node positive patients (p = 0.072). Median OS was not significantly different between patients >= 70 years versus the patient cohort (n = 152) aged < 70 years (13.9 vs. 7.2 months, p = 0.072) but PFS showed a significant difference (4.9 vs. 9.5 months, p = 0.026) in favor of the > 70 years group., CONCLUSION: Prognosis in elderly patients with inoperable esophageal cancer undergoing definitive radiotherapy/radiochemotherapy is limited, although it is not inferior to patients < 70 years.",Excluded
457,"Clinical Outcomes of Image Guided Adaptive Hypofractionated Weekly Radiation Therapy for Bladder Cancer in Patients Unsuitable for Radical Treatment. Purpose and Objectives We report on the clinical outcomes of a phase 2 study assessing image guided hypofractionated weekly radiation therapy in bladder cancer patients unsuitable for radical treatment. Methods and Materials Fifty-five patients with T2-T4aNx-2M0-1 bladder cancer not suitable for cystectomy or daily radiation therapy treatment were recruited. A ""plan of the day"" radiation therapy approach was used, treating the whole (empty) bladder to 36 Gy in 6 weekly fractions. Acute toxicity was assessed weekly during radiation therapy, at 6 and 12 weeks using the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events version 3.0. Late toxicity was assessed at 6 months and 12 months using Radiation Therapy Oncology Group grading. Cystoscopy was used to assess local control at 3 months. Cumulative incidence function was used to determine local progression at 1 at 2 years. Death without local progression was treated as a competing risk. Overall survival was estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method. Results Median age was 86 years (range, 68-97 years). Eighty-seven percent of patients completed their prescribed course of radiation therapy. Genitourinary and gastrointestinal grade 3 acute toxicity was seen in 18% (10/55) and 4% (2/55) of patients, respectively. No grade 4 genitourinary or gastrointestinal toxicity was seen. Grade >=3 late toxicity (any) at 6 and 12 months was seen in 6.5% (2/31) and 4.3% (1/23) of patients, respectively. Local control after radiation therapy was 92% of assessed patients (60% total population). Cumulative incidence of local progression at 1 year and 2 years for all patients was 7% (95% confidence interval [CI] 2%-17%) and 17% (95% CI 8%-29%), respectively. Overall survival at 1 year was 63% (95% CI 48%-74%). Conclusion Hypofractionated radiation therapy delivered weekly with a plan of the day approach offers good local control with acceptable toxicity in a patient population not suitable for radical bladder treatment.Copyright © 2017 The Author(s)",Excluded
3686,"Radiation dose and intra-articular access: comparison of the lateral mortise and anterior midline approaches to fluoroscopically guided tibiotalar joint injections. PURPOSE: To compare the lateral mortise and anterior midline approaches to fluoroscopically guided tibiotalar joint injections with respect to successful intra-articular needle placement, fluoroscopy time, radiation dose, and dose area product (DAP)., MATERIALS AND METHODS: This retrospective study was IRB-approved and HIPAA-compliant. 498 fluoroscopically guided tibiotalar joint injections were performed or supervised by one of nine staff radiologists from 11/1/2010-12/31/2013. The injection approach was determined by operator preference. Images were reviewed on a PACS workstation to determine the injection approach (lateral mortise versus anterior midline) and to confirm intra-articular needle placement. Fluoroscopy time (minutes), radiation dose (mGy), and DAP (muGy-m(2)) were recorded and compared using the student's t-test (fluoroscopy time) or the Wilcoxon rank sum test (radiation dose and DAP)., RESULTS: There were 246 lateral mortise injections and 252 anterior midline injections. Two lateral mortise injections were excluded from further analysis because no contrast was administered. Intra-articular location of the needle tip was documented in 242/244 lateral mortise injections and 252/252 anterior midline injections. Mean fluoroscopy time was shorter for the lateral mortise group than the anterior midline group (0.7 +/- 0.5 min versus 1.2 +/- 0.8 min, P < 0.0001). Mean radiation dose and DAP were less for the lateral mortise group than the anterior midline group (2.1 +/- 3.7 mGy versus 2.5 +/- 3.5 mGy, P = 0.04; 11.5 +/- 15.3 muGy-m(2) versus 13.5 +/- 17.3 muGy-m(2), P = 0.006)., CONCLUSION: Both injection approaches resulted in nearly 100% rates of intra-articular needle placement, but the lateral mortise approach used approximately 40% less fluoroscopy time and delivered 15% lower radiation dose and DAP to the patient.",Excluded
262,"Probability of receiving a high cumulative radiation dose and primary clinical indication of CT examinations: A 5-year observational cohort study. Objective High radiation exposure is a concern because of the association with cancer. The objective was to determine the probability of receiving a high radiation dose from CT (from one or more examinations within a 5-year period) and to assess the clinical context by evaluating clinical indications in the high-dose patient group. Design Observational cohort study. Effective radiation dose received from one or more CT examinations within a predefined 5-year calendar period was assessed for each patient. Setting Hospital setting. Participants All patients undergoing a diagnostic CT examination between July 2013 and July 2018 at the Maastricht University Medical Center. Primary and secondary outcome measures The primary outcome was the probability of receiving a high effective dose, defined as >=100 mSv, from one or more CT examinations within 5 years as derived from a time-to-event analysis. Secondary outcomes were the clinical indication for the initial scan of patients receiving a high effective dose. Results 100 672 CT examinations were performed among 49 978 patients including 482 (1%) who received a high radiation dose. The estimated probability of a high effective dose from a single examination is low (0.002% (95% CI 0.00% to 0.01%)). The 4.5-year probability of receiving a high cumulative effective dose was 1.9% (95% CI 1.6% to 2.2%) for women and 1.5% (95% CI 1.3% to 1.7%) for men. The probability was highest in age categories between 51 and 74 years. A total of 2711 (5.5%) of patients underwent more than six CT examinations, and the probability of receiving a high effective dose was 16%. Among patients who received a high effective dose, most indications (80%) were oncology related. Conclusions The probability of receiving a high radiation dose from CT examinations is small but not negligible. In the majority (80%) of high effective dose receiving patients, the indication for the initial CT scan was oncology related.Copyright © Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2021.

1396,"Sun-induced changes of stratum corneum hydration vary with age and gender in a normal Chinese population. BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES: Previous studies have demonstrated that sun-induced alteration of epidermal permeability barrier function varies with gender and age. In the present study, we assess the stratum corneum (SC) hydration in sun-exposed males and females., METHODS: A total of 168 subjects (84 males and 84 females) aged 19-75 years were enrolled. A multifunctional skin physiology monitor was used to measure SC hydration., RESULTS: In comparison with non-sun exposure, sun exposure does not cause a significant change in SC hydration in either young males or young females, whereas in aged females, a significant reduction of SC hydration is seen on the forehead and the dorsal hand of sun-exposed subjects. SC hydration on the canthus of both aged males and aged females is significantly lower than that of young subjects. Additionally, SC hydration on the dorsal hand of aged females is also significantly lower as compared with young females. Sun-induced reduction of SC hydration is more evident on the dorsal hand of aged females than that of males (P<0.001). Moreover, the SC rehydration capacity is significantly lower in sun-exposed aged females than in age-matched males., CONCLUSION: These results demonstrated that sun-induced changes of the SC hydration property vary with age and gender.

2676,"Definitive radical external beam radiotherapy for rectal cancer: evaluation of local effectiveness and risk of late small bowel damage. AIM: To present a retrospective analysis of results of definitive radiotherapy for rectal cancer., MATERIAL AND METHODS: Forty-one consecutive patients with rectal cancer (32% primary, 61% pelvic recurrence and 7% after R2 resection) who could not be treated with surgery underwent external beam radiotherapy. A median tumour dose of 64 Gy was given with 1.8-2.5 Gy per fraction using 2D or 3D technique. In 46% of patients, concurrent 5-Fu-based chemotherapy was given. The median follow-up was 54 months., RESULTS: Clinical complete response was achieved in 39% of patients. Five-year cumulative incidence of local failure, overall survival and cancer specific survival were 76%, 26% and 30%, respectively. Of 11 patients with local control, in five cases the tumour was larger than 5 cm and in the other five the tumour was fixed. Two patients, regarded as locally controlled had non-progressive tumour without local symptoms at the last follow-up of 54 and 118 months post-radiotherapy. Late toxicity occurred in 22% of patients, all with acceptable severity. There was no bowel obstruction requiring surgery despite that in 18 patients the small bowel dose was >60 Gy to a mean volume of 51 cm(3)., CONCLUSION: Definitive radio(chemo)therapy provides a chance for local control even in patients with large fixed or recurrent rectal cancer.",Excluded

Background: Aged patients are underrepresented in clinical trials on catheter ablation of atrial fibrillation (AF). In addition, results of outcomes after repeat ablation in the elderly are lacking. We report the results of first repeat AF ablation procedures of aged patients from a real-world multicenter prospective registry. Method(s): Patients undergoing second AF ablation included in the prospective, multicenter German Ablation Registry were divided in two groups (age > 70 years (group 1) and age <= 70 years (group 2)) and analyzed for procedural characteristics and clinical follow-up. Result(s): 738 patients were analyzed (108 patients in group 1, 630 patients in group 2). Significantly more aged patients had structural heart disease (56 patients (51.9%) vs. 203 patients (32.2%), p < 0.001). The majority of the patients underwent repeat pulmonary vein isolation (101 patients (93.5%) vs. 593 patients (94.1%), p = 0.98). More aged patients underwent ablation of left atrial linear lesions (78.1% vs. 57.3% of all linear lesions, p = 0.027). There was no difference in the occurrence of peri-procedural complications (7 patients (6.5%) vs. 24 patients (3.8%), p = 0.30).

2340,"Noise reduction technology reduces radiation dose in chronic total occlusions percutaneous coronary intervention: a propensity score-matched analysis. Chronic total occlusions (CTO) percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) is associated with high radiation dose. Our study aim was to evaluate the impact of the implementation of a noise reduction technology (NRT) on patient radiation dose during CTO PCI. A total of 187 CTO PCIs performed between February 2016 and May 2017 were analyzed according to the angiographic systems utilized: Standard (n = 60) versus NRT (n = 127). Propensity score matching (PSM) was performed to control for differences in baseline characteristics. Primary endpoints were Cumulative Air Kerma at Interventional Reference Point (AK at IRP), which correlates with patient's tissue reactions; and Kerma Area Product (KAP), a surrogate measure of patient's risk of stochastic radiation effects. An Efficiency Index (defined as fluoroscopy time/AK at IRP) was calculated for each procedure. Image quality was evaluated using a 5-grade Likert-like scale. After PSM, n = 55 pairs were identified. Baseline and angiographic characteristics were well matched between groups. Compared to the Standard system, NRT was associated with lower AK at IRP [2.38 (1.80-3.66) vs. 3.24 (2.04-5.09) Gy, p = 0.035], a trend towards reduction for KAP [161 (93-244) vs. 203 (136-363) Gycm2, p = 0.069], and a better Efficiency Index [16.75 (12.73-26.27) vs. 13.58 (9.92-17.63) min/Gy, p = 0.003]. Image quality was similar between the two groups (4.39 +/- 0.53 Standard vs. 4.34 +/- 0.47 NRT, p = 0.571). In conclusion, compared with a Standard system, the use of NRT in CTO PCI is associated with lower patient radiation dose and similar image quality.",Excluded

For comminuted shaft fracture of clavicle, the operative goal, aside from sound bone healing without complications of direct reduction, is maintenance of the original length in order to maintain the normal biomechanics of adjacent joint. Our bridge plating technique utilizing distraction through a lumbar spreader was expected to be effective for restoring clavicular length with soft tissue preservation. However, there are two disadvantages. First, there is more exposure to radiation compared to conventional plating; and second, it is difficult to control the rotational alignment. Despite these disadvantages, our technique has important benefits, in particular, the ability to preserve clavicular length without soft tissue injury around the fracture site. © 2013 by The Korean Orthopaedic Association.",Excluded

OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this article is to retrospectively determine the image quality and degree of radiation dose reduction that is clinically acceptable for CT-guided renal tumor cryoablation., MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 15 patients (17 procedures; mean age, 67 years; range, 38-85 years) undergoing clinically indicated CT-guided renal tumor cryoablation procedures were included in this retrospective study. A previously validated noise-insertion tool was used to simulate reduced-dose scans at 75%, 50%, 25%, and 10% of the original dose at four representative phases of the cryoablation procedure. Images obtained at different dose levels were randomized and reviewed by three radiologists blinded to the level of dose reduction, who scored them independently with a 5-point scale (1-5, with 5 the best). Images with a mean score of 3 or higher were considered diagnostically acceptable. The minimal acceptable dose was that at which 90% of images were considered diagnostically acceptable. Interrater agreement was assessed using the weighted kappa statistic., RESULTS: The weighted kappa value was 0.68, indicating substantial agreement among the reviewers. The averaged percentage of diagnostically acceptable images for the four series was 100% for a full dose, 98-100% for the 75% dose level, 94-98% for the 50% dose level, and less than 90% for images obtained at the 25% and 10% dose levels, which was considered unacceptable., CONCLUSION: On the basis of results from 15 patients (17 procedures), images obtained from CT acquisitions at 50% (volume CT dose index, 12.2 mGy) of the original dose level (volume CT dose index, 24.4 mGy) were acceptable for the purpose of CT monitoring of renal cryoablation procedures.",Excluded

Purpose Stereotactic body image guided radiation therapy (SBRT) shows good results for lung cancer treatment. Better normal tissue sparing might be achieved with scanned carbon ion therapy (PT). Therefore an in silico trial was conducted to find potential advantages of and patients suited for PT. Methods For 19 patients treated with SBRT, PT plans were calculated on 4D-CTs with simulated breathing motion. Prescribed single fraction dose was 24 Gy and OAR constraints used for photon planning were respected. Motion was mitigated by rescanning and range-adapted ITVs. Doses were compared to the original SBRT plans. Results CTV coverage was the same in SBRT and PT. The field-specific PTV including range margins for PT was 1.5 (median, 25-75% 1.3-2.1) times larger than for SBRT. Nevertheless, maximum point dose and mean dose in OARs were higher in SBRT by 2.8 (1.6-3.7) Gy and 0.7 (0.3-1.6) Gy, respectively. Patients with a CTV >2.5 cc or with multiple lung lesions showed larger differences in OAR doses in favor of PT. Conclusions Patients receive less dose in critical OARs such as heart, spinal cord, esophagus, trachea and aorta with PT, while maintaining the same target coverage.

2415,"Evaluating the role of prophylactic gastrostomy tube placement prior to definitive chemoradiotherapy for head and neck cancer. Purpose: To determine the effect of prophylactic gastrostomy tube (GT) placement on acute and long-term outcome for patients treated with definitive chemoradiotherapy for locally advanced head and neck cancer. Methods and Materials: One hundred twenty consecutive patients were treated with chemoradiotherapy for Stage III/IV head and neck cancer to a median dose of 70 Gy (range, 64-74 Gy). The most common primary site was the oropharynx (66 patients). Sixty-seven patients (56%) were treated using intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT). Seventy patients (58%) received prophylactic GT placement at the discretion of the physician before initiation of chemoradiotherapy. Result(s): Prophylactic GT placement significantly reduced weight loss during radiation therapy from 43 pounds (range, 0 to 76 pounds) to 19 pounds (range, 0 to 51 pounds), which corresponded to a net change of -14% (range, 0% to -30%) and -8% (range, +1% to -22%) from baseline, respectively (p < 0.001). However, the proportion of patients who were GT-dependent at 6- and 12-months after treatment was 41% and 21%, respectively, compared with 8% and 0%, respectively, for those with and without prophylactic GT (p < 0.001). Additionally, prophylactic GT was associated with a significantly higher incidence of late esophageal stricture compared with those who did not have prophylactic GT (30% vs. 6%, p < 0.001). Conclusion(s): Although prophylactic GT placement was effective at preventing acute weight loss and the need for intravenous hydration, it was also associated with significantly higher rates of late esophageal toxicity. The benefits of this strategy must be balanced with the risks. © 2010 Elsevier Inc.",Excluded

PURPOSE: The purpose of this study is to determine radiotherapy (RT) dose-volumetric threshold of radiation-induced hypothyroidism (HT) in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) patients., PATIENTS AND METHODS: The diagnosis of HT in 78 HNSCC patients treated with RT was based on a thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) level greater than the maximum value of laboratory range. In all patients, dose-volumetric parameters were analyzed according to their relation to development of HT, and thyroid volumes spared from doses >=10, 20, 30, 40 and 50Gy (V10, V20, V30, V40 and V50) were analyzed from the dose volume histograms (DVHs)., RESULTS: Median follow-up duration was 31months. At the end of study, 33 patients (42.3%) developed HT and the cumulative incidence of HT was 24.6%, 36.5% and 42.3% at one, two and three years, respectively. V30 of 42.1% (P=0.005) was defined as dose-volumetric threshold of radiation-induced HT in HNSCC patients. Our analysis showed that V30 separates patients into low- and high-risk groups; the incidence of radiation-induced HT in the group with V30<42.1% and V30>=42.1% was 29.4% and 71.4%, respectively (P=0.002)., CONCLUSIONS: The V30 may predict risk of developing HT after RT for HNSCC patients.

To investigate the relationship of domestic radon levels and cancer, the incidence of 14 major cancers in Devon and Cornwall were examined in relation to the local radon levels. Cancer registrations for 1989-1992 were provided by the South-Western Regional Cancer Registry. The average radon levels for postcode sectors were sorted into ten categories from low (< 40 Bq/m3) to extremely high (> or = 230 Bq/m3) and age-standardised incidence rates were calculated for each radon category. The incidence rates for lung cancer, where radon has been claimed to be a risk factor, were very similar across all domestic radon categories. Only non-melanoma skin cancers, showed a significant increase in incidence in the high-radon postcode sectors (> or = 100 Bq/m3) compared with the low-radon sectors (< 60 Bq/m3) and this effect was observed for both sexes. The remaining 12 cancer sites showed no significant trend in incidence rates with increasing radon concentration. There was no significant difference in corrected survival rates for any cancer site between the low- and high-radon areas.

1174,"Stereotactic drainage and Gamma Knife radiosurgery of cystic brain metastasis. Object. Treatment options for patients with brain metastasis include tumor resection, whole-brain radiation therapy, and radiosurgery. A single treatment is not useful in cases of multiple tumors, of which at least 1 is a cystic tumor. The purpose of this study was to assess the role of stereotactic drainage and Gamma Knife surgery (GKS) in the treatment of cystic brain metastasis. Methods. Between January 2001 and November 2005, 680 consecutive patients with brain metastases underwent GKS at our hospital, 30 of whom were included in this study (18 males and 12 females, mean age 60.6 +/- 11 years, range 38-75 years). Inclusion criteria were: 1) no prior whole-brain radiation therapy or resection procedure; 2) a maximum of 4 lesions on preoperative MR imaging; 3) at least 1 cystic lesion; 4) a Karnofsky Performance Scale score >= 70; and 5) histological diagnosis of a malignant tumor. Results. Non-small cell lung carcinoma was the primary cancer in most patients (19 patients [63.3%]). A single metastasis was present in 13 patients (43.3%). There was a total of 81 tumors, 33 of which were cystic. Ten patients (33.3%) were in recursive partitioning analysis Class I, and 20 (66.6%) were in Class II. Before drainage the mean tumor volume was 21.8 ml (range 3.8-68 ml); before GKS the mean tumor volume was 10.1 ml (range 1.2-32 ml).

Attenuation-corrected whole-body PET/CT scans were performed from 0 to 90 min, at 120 and at 240 min after injection of 305.0 +/- 17.6 MBq of BAY 85-8050. Organs with moderate to high uptake at any of the imaging time points were used as source organs. Total activity in each organ at each time point was measured. Time-activity curves (TAC) were determined for the whole body and all source organs. The resulting TACs were fitted to exponential equations and accumulated activities were determined. OLINDA/EXM software was used to calculate individual organ doses and the whole-body ED from the acquired data. Result(s): Uptake of the tracer was highest in the kidneys due to renal excretion of the tracer, followed by the pancreas, heart wall and osteogenic cells. The mean organ doses were: kidneys 38.4 +/- 11.2 muSv/MBq, pancreas 23.2 +/- 3.8 muSv/MBq, heart wall 17.4 +/- 4.1 muSv/MBq, and osteogenic cells 13.6 +/- 3.5 muSv/MBq. The calculated ED was 8.9 +/- 1.5 muSv/MBq. Conclusion(s): Based on the distribution and dose estimates, the calculated radiation dose of BAY 85-8050 is 2.67 +/- 0.45 mSv at a patient dose of 300 MBq, which compares favourably with the radiation dose of FDG (5.7 mSv). © 2013 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.",Excluded

240,"Radiosurgery for solitary brain metastases using the cobalt-60 gamma unit: methods and results in 24 patients. To define the role of stereotactic radiosurgery in the treatment of metastatic brain tumors we treated 24 consecutive patients (20 men, 4 women) with the 201-source 60Co gamma unit between May 1988 and March 1990. The primary tumors included malignant melanoma (n = 10), non-small cell lung carcinoma (n = 6), renal cell carcinoma (n = 3), colorectal carcinoma (n = 1), oropharyngeal carcinoma (n = 1), and adenocarcinoma of unknown origin (n = 3). All tumors were less than or equal to 3.0 cm in greatest diameter. Twenty patients received a planned combination of 30-40 Gy whole brain fractionated irradiation and a radiosurgical ""boost"" of 16-20 Gy to the tumor margins; one patient refused conventional fractionated irradiation. Three patients with recurrent, persistent, or new non-small cell lung carcinomas had radiosurgical treatment 12-20 months after receiving 30-42.5 Gy whole-brain external beam irradiation. Stereotactic computed tomographic imaging was used for target coordinate determination and imaging-integrated dose planning. All tumors were enclosed by the 50-90% isodose shell using one (n = 22), two (n = 1), or three (n = 1) irradiation isocenters. During this 23-month period (median follow-up of 7 months) no patient died from progression of a radiosurgically-treated brain metastasis. Ten patients died of systemic disease (n = 8) or remote central nervous system metastasis (n = 2) between 1 week and 10 months after radiosurgery. One patient had tumor progression and underwent craniotomy and tumor excision 5 months after radiosurgery. To date, median survival after radiosurgery has been 10 months; 1-year survival was 33.3%. Stereotactic radiosurgery eliminated the surgical and anesthetic risks associated with craniotomy and resection of solitary brain metastases. Radiosurgery also effectively controlled the growth of tumors considered ""resistant"" to conventional irradiation.",Excluded

2498,"Nuclear medicine in the acute clinical setting: indications, imaging findings, and potential pitfalls. Nuclear medicine imaging provides valuable functional information that complements information obtained with anatomic imaging techniques in the evaluation of patients with specific acute clinical manifestations. Nuclear medicine studies are most often used in conjunction with other imaging modalities and as a problem-solving tool. Under certain circumstances a nuclear medicine study may be indicated as the first-line imaging modality, as in the case of renal scintigraphy for transplant dysfunction in the early postoperative period. Nuclear imaging may be preferred when a conventional first-line study is contraindicated or when it is important to minimize radiation exposure. The portability of nuclear imaging offers particular advantages for the evaluation of critically ill patients whose clinical condition is unstable and who cannot be safely transported out of the intensive care unit. The ability to visualize physiologic and pathophysiologic processes over relatively long time periods without adding to the patient's radiation exposure contributes to the high diagnostic sensitivity of several types of nuclear medicine studies. Viewing the acquired images in the cine mode adds to the value of these studies for diagnosing and characterizing dynamic abnormalities such as intermittent internal bleeding and bile or urine leakage. In this pictorial review, the spectrum of nuclear medicine studies commonly performed in the acute care setting is reviewed according to body systems and organs, with detailed descriptions of the indications, technical considerations, findings, and potential pitfalls of each type of study.

1434,"Nonmelanoma skin cancer in mountain guides: high prevalence and lack of awareness warrant development of evidence-based prevention tools. AIMS OF THE STUDY: Nonmelanoma skin cancer (NMSC) is the most common cancer in Switzerland and Europe. The main causative factor is exposure to ultraviolet radiation, which puts outdoor workers in general at a higher risk of developing NMSC than indoor workers. However, few studies have clinically examined the risk of developing NMSC to outdoor workers, especially mountain guides. We aimed to investigate the prevalence of NMSC and corresponding precancerous lesions, and the associated risk behaviour of mountain and ski guides in order to develop future prevention programmes., METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional study including mountain and ski guides from southern Germany, who underwent a full-body skin check-up by a dermatologist. We assessed their NMSC awareness and risk behaviour using a paper-based questionnaire., RESULTS: Of the 62 state-certified mountain and ski guides (55 men, 7 women; mean age 52.9 +/- 13.4 years) included in this study, 27 (43.5%) were diagnosed with NMSC or its premalignant stages. In addition, 59.7% of the participants expressed the opinion that their protection from ultraviolet radiation exposure needs to be improved; 83.6% requested further information on NMSC, and 48.5% had never undergone a skin check-up or consulted a dermatologist before., CONCLUSIONS: Mountain and ski guides are at a high risk for developing NMSC. Their unmet medical needs indicate an underestimation of NMSC prevalence, which is usually based on reports by insurance companies, and offer the chance for developing evidence-based awareness and prevention tools that can be promoted to individuals with other outdoor jobs.",Excluded
911,"Helicobacter gastritis induces changes in the oxyntic mucosa indistinguishable from the effects of proton pump inhibitors. A causal relationship between oxyntic glands dilatation with protruding parietal cells, referred to as proton pump inhibitor (PPI) effects, and PPI use has been suspected but not established. We designed this study to evaluate the association between these changes and the use of PPIs and histamine 2-receptor blockers (H2-blockers). We obtained five Sydney System-compliant biopsy specimens from patients recruited into a therapeutic trial for H. pylori. Medication history with details on PPI and H 2-blockers use was collected. Two blinded pathologists graded gastritis and the intensity of putative PPI effects using a 0 to 3 scale. PPI and H2-blocker use was then disclosed and the accuracy of pathologists' assessment was analyzed. There were 138 H. pylori-negative and 104 positive patients. In H. pylori-negative patients the histologic assessment for PPI use had 77.5% sensitivity and 51.8% specificity, with a positive predictive value of 86.9% and a negative predictive value of 35.9%. In H. pylori-positive patients, sensitivity was 74.1% and specificity 26.1%. Positive and negative predictive values were 55.8% and 44.4%, respectively. Neither glandular dilatations nor parietal cell protrusions related to H2-blocker use. We conclude that these changes are associated with PPI use only in H. pylori-negative subjects. In H. pylori gastritis, so-called PPI-effects were equally prevalent in PPI-users and non-users, indicating that other factors are involved in the induction of oxyntic cell hyperplasia. We suggest that comments regarding the supposed evidence of PPI use are too often wrong to be useful and should be avoided in the diagnosis of gastric biopsy specimens. © 2013 Elsevier Inc.

3684,"Low-dose semi-coronal CT of the sacroiliac joints in the early diagnosis of ankylosing spondylitis. Background: Imaging modalities are essential for the diagnosis of ankylosing spondylitis (AS). Radiographic sacroiliitis is the requirement of 1984 modified New York (mNY) criteria for AS but with the disadvantage of low sensitivity. MRI has the advantage of detecting active inflammatory lesions but was criticized for low specificity. Computerized tomography (CT) has higher diagnostic accuracy than radiography in detecting structural changes, but its application has been limited for high radiation dose. The reduction of radiation dose can be achieved by decreasing the tube current[1] and previous study has demonstrated that effective dose (ED) of semi-coronal sacroiliac joint (SIJ) CT is at least six times lower in female or nearly four times lower in male than that of axial SIJ CT[2]. Objective(s): To evaluate the value of low-dose semi-coronal SIJ CT in the early diagnosis of AS. Method(s): Thirty-three patients diagnosed by mNY criteria who had pre-existing axial SIJ CT in past two years with visible structural damage were enrolled. These patients underwent low-dose semi-coronal SIJ CT examination which was obtained at 3-mm slices, 140 kV and 120 mAs, with the gantry tilted 20-25degree cranially. The ED of the low-dose semi-coronal CT and the pre-existing conventional axial CT were compared. Image qualities of the low-dose semicoronal CT were blind-graded separately by 2 rheumatologists into poor, fair, good or excellent. And the correlation between image quality and body mass index (BMI) was analyzed. The CT scans were read in a blinded manner by 2 rheumatologists who had been trained by radiologists. CT scans of the two groups were graded respectively by mNY criteria, the criteria established by Lee[3] and the Innsbruck criteria[4]. The kappa coefficient was used to assess the consistency of grading between the two groups. Result(s): Thirty-three patients received low-dose semi-coronal CT examination with an average ED of 3.37 mSv, which meant a 49% reduction in radiation compared to the pre-existing CT. The quality of images of male patients with BMI<25 kg/m2 and all female patients were good or excellent. Image qualities were assessed as poor or fair in 58% (7/12) male patients whose BMI>25 kg/m2. There was a significant negative correlation between image quality and BMI (r=-0.784,P=0.000). The grading of low-dose semi-coronal CT showed no differences as compared with the pre-existing CT by mNY criteria (see below). For the other two classification criteria, the consistency of grading between the two groups were satisfactory (kappa=0.897 by Lee criteria; kappa=0.814 by Innsbruck criteria; P>0.05). Conclusion(s): The radiation dose of low-dose semi-coronal SIJ CT was reduced significantly compared with the conventional axial SIJ CT with acceptable diagnostic efficacy.

135,"Risk assessment for developing gliomas: A comparison of two cytogenetic approaches. Chromosome instability (CIN) measured as chromosome aberrations has long been suggested as a cancer susceptibility biomarker. Conventional cytogenetic end-points are now being improved by combining molecular methods, which increases the sensitivity, specificity, and precision of the assay. In this study we examined both spontaneous and gamma-ray induced CIN in lymphocyte cultures from 51 previously untreated glioma patients and 51 age-, sex- and ethnicity-matched controls. CIN was assessed using two parallel methods: (1) the mutagen sensitivity (MS) assay and (2) the multicolor fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) assay. The frequency of spontaneous breaks was significantly higher in glioma patients (mean +/- S.D., 2.12 +/- 1.07) than in controls (1.24 +/- 0.86, P < 0.001) when using the FISH assay but not the MS assay (0.019 +/- 0.02 and 0.019 +/- 0.01, respectively; P = 0.915). Similarly, the frequency of induced chromatid breaks was significantly higher using the FISH assay (3.39 +/- 1.72) but not the MS assay (0.42 +/- 0.16) in the patients versus controls (2.08 +/- 1.18 and 0.37 +/- 0.15, respectively; P < 0.001 and P = 0.10, respectively). By using the median number of breaks in the controls as the cutoff value, we observed an odds ratio (ORs) of 5.13 (95% CI = 2.23-12.1) for spontaneous and 4.86 (95% CI = 2.08-11.4) for induced CIN using the FISH assay, whereas the ORs were 1.32 (95% CI = 0.49-3.58) and 1.28 (95% CI = 0.59-2.80) for spontaneous and induced CIN using the MS assay. There was also a significant increase in the frequency of hyperdiploid cells in the glioma cases which could only be detected using the FISH assay (OR = 4.0, 95% CL = 0.9-17.0). By combining both methods an estimated risk of 7.0 (95% CI = 1.7-25.6) was observed. There was no correlation between the breaks detected by the two methods suggesting that each method is a measure of a different event. The results indicate that using the multicolor FISH assay for detection of CIN in peripheral blood lymphocytes in glioma patients is a more useful marker for risk assessment. © 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.",Excluded
1139,"Identification of ureteral stones at reduced radiation exposure: a pilot study comparing conventional versus digital low-dosage linear slot scanning (Lodox R) radiography. PURPOSE: Digital low-dosage, linear slot scanning radiography (Lodox R) is an imaging modality that can emit down to one-tenth the radiation of conventional X-ray systems. We prospectively evaluated Lodox R as a diagnostic imaging modality in patients with ureterolithiasis., METHODS: Conventional kidney-ureter-bladder (KUB) X-ray and Lodox R were performed in 41 patients presenting with acute flank pain due to unilateral ureteral stone confirmed by computed tomography. KUB X-ray and Lodox R images were then reviewed by four blinded readers (urology expert/resident, radiology expert/resident). Identification rates were compared using Pearson's Chi square test. The impact of different parameters on stone identification by Lodox R was evaluated using logistic regression and generalized linear mixed models. Inter-reader agreement was tested using Cohen's kappa coefficient., RESULTS: Median stone size was 5 mm (range 2-12), median stone density was 800 HU (range 200-1500). The identification rates of the urology expert were 68% for KUB X-ray and 90% for Lodox R (p = 0.014), and for all four readers 61% for KUB X-ray and 62% for Lodox R (p = 0.8). Radiation exposure for KUB X-ray and Lodox R was 0.45 mSv (SD +/- 0.64) and 0.027 mSv (SD +/- 0.038), respectively. Multivariable analyses showed an association between stone identification by Lodox R and stone size (p < 0.001), stone density (p = 0.005), lower body mass index (p = 0.005), and reader (p < 0.001)., CONCLUSIONS: The high identification rates and low radiation doses of Lodox R make it a promising imaging modality for the diagnosis of ureteral stones.

387,"Brain metastases resection cavity radio-surgery based on T2-weighted MRI: technique assessment. Purpose: Stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) is commonly performed after surgical resection of brain metastases to reduce the chance of local tumor recurrence while maintaining cognitive function. Target delineation in these cases is typically based off T1-weighted post-gadolinium MRI (T1Gd). In this study, we report outcomes for patients having postoperative SRS in which the planning target volume (PTV) was based on T2-weighted MRI (T2W). Method(s): Sixty-two consecutive patients having single-fraction SRS after brain metastases resection were retrospectively reviewed. Excluded were patients with prior whole brain radiation therapy, multiple resection cavities, and small cell pathologies. Result(s): The median time from surgery to SRS was 11 days; 26 patients (42%) had SRS <= 7 days. The median PTV was 8.0 cm3; the median margin dose was 18 Gy. The crude rates of local tumor control (LC), leptomeningeal disease (LMD), distant brain recurrence (DBR), and radiation necrosis (RN) were 85%, 19%, 37%, and 2%, respectively. The 1-year LC, LMD, DBR, and RN rates were 88%, 25%, 36%, and 0%, respectively. No tumor or dosimetric factor was associated with LC. Sub-total tumor resection was a risk factor for LMD (HR 5.11, P = 0.003), whereas patients with multiple brain metastases had a greater risk of DBR (HR 2.88, P = 0.01). The median PTV was smaller compared to the median PTV based off the consensus guidelines utilizing T1Gd MRI (8.0 cm3 vs. 9.1 cm3, P = 0.004). Conclusion(s): T2W MRI provided accurate resection cavity delineation even in the early postoperative period and was associated with decreased PTV compared to T1Gd MRI in the majority of cases.Copyright © 2020, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.",Excluded
2159,"Preoperative Prediction of Pathologic Response to Neoadjuvant Chemoradiotherapy in Patients With Esophageal Cancer Using 18F-FDG PET/CT and DW-MRI: A Prospective Multicenter Study. Purpose: Accurate preoperative prediction of pathologic response to neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy (nCRT) in patients with esophageal cancer could enable omission of esophagectomy in patients with a pathologic complete response (pCR). This study aimed to evaluate the individual and combined value of 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography with integrated computed tomography (18F-FDG PET/CT) and diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (DW-MRI) during and after nCRT to predict pathologic response in patients with esophageal cancer. Methods and Materials: In this multicenter prospective study, patients scheduled to receive nCRT followed by esophagectomy for esophageal cancer underwent 18F-FDG PET/CT and DW-MRI scanning before the start of nCRT, during nCRT, and before esophagectomy. Response to nCRT was based on histopathologic evaluation of the resection specimen. Relative changes in 18F-FDG PET/CT and DW-MRI parameters were compared between patients with pCR and non-pCR groups. Multivariable ridge regression analyses with bootstrapped c-indices were performed to evaluate the individual and combined value of 18F-FDG PET/CT and DW-MRI. Result(s): pCR was found in 26.1% of 69 patients. Relative changes in 18F-FDG PET/CT parameters after nCRT (DELTA standardized uptake value [SUV]mean,post P = .016, and DELTA total lesion glycolysis post P = .024), as well as changes in DW-MRI parameters during nCRT (DELTA apparent diffusion coefficient [ADC]during P = .008) were significantly different between pCR and non-pCR. A c-statistic of 0.84 was obtained for a model with DELTAADCduring, DELTASUVmean,post, and histology in classifying patients as pCR (versus 0.82 for DELTAADCduring and 0.79 for DELTASUVmean,post alone). Conclusion(s): Changes on 18F-FDG PET/CT after nCRT and early changes on DW-MRI during nCRT can help identify pCR to nCRT in esophageal cancer. Moreover, 18F-FDG PET/CT and DW-MRI might be of complementary value in the assessment of pCR.Copyright © 2020 Elsevier Inc.",Excluded
1199,"Selective arterial embolisation for the treatment of mobile spine aneurismal bone cyst: Prospective study. Introduzione: Aneurismal Bone Cyst (ABC) is a benign cystic lesion of the bone made of blood containing gaps separated by connective tissue. In 10-30 % of cases ABC is localized at spine level. Different treatment options are possible: 1) curettage and bone grafting; 2) en bloc excision; 3) selective arterial embolization (SAE); 4) radiotherapy; 5) combination of these procedures. The aim of this study is to evaluate prospectively the results obtained using SAE only for the treatment of ABC. Materiali e metodi: 20 patients (9 female, 11 male), mean age 24 years (range: 12-39 years), mean follow up 40 months (range: 9.4- 49.4 months) affected by Aneurismal Bone Cyst of the mobile spine without instability were analyzed. Patients underwent the same diagnostic protocol (X-ray, CT scan, MRI) and the same treatment (selective arterial embolization). The same evaluation protocol was used for all patients (X-ray, CT scan at 8 weeks following embolization). Risultati: From one to seven SAE were performed depending on cases. The mean length of hospital stay was 2.2 days for each embolization treatment (range 2-5 days). 18 patients on 20 were treated using SAE only. In 1 case, presenting progressive paraplegia due to T8 ABC, surgical decompression and T6-T10 fixation were needed. (Frankel E after surgery). After 3 months F.U. local recurrence was observed and it is being treated using SAE.

Nowadays SAE represents an effective, safe and minimally invasive approach for the treatment of ABC. It could be considered the gold standard treatment for ABC without instability or neurological complications. In the case of failure or poor results surgical treatment must be considered.",Excluded
2353,"Insufficient Vitamin D Response to Solar Radiation in German Patients with Type 2 Diabetes or Gestational Diabetes. Vitamin D deficiency is highly prevalent in all forms of diabetes mellitus. Recently, we reported how ultraviolet B (UVB) radiation affected vitamin D [25(OH)D3] concentrations in patients with type 1 diabetes. Our aim was to analyze whether patients with non-autoimmune diabetes, such as type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) also show the same vitamin D profile in relation to environmental factors including ambient temperature as an indirect parameter for outdoor activities. We analyzed 25(OH)D3 concentrations of T2DM (n=349) and GDM patients (n=327) at the University Hospital Frankfurt from 2005 to 2007. Additionally, daily UVB and monthly outside air temperature measurements for Frankfurt/Germany were obtained. We detected a positive correlation between UVB irradiation and 25(OH)D3 concentrations of T2DM and GDM patients (rho=0.50 and rho=0.63, p=0.003 and p<0.0001, respectively). UVB irradiation was in summer (April-October) higher than in winter (November-March) (5.6 kJ/m vs. 0.5 kJ/m, p<0.0001). However, the prevalence of vitamin D deficiency in summer remained high with 76% in T2DM and 59% in GDM. In a stepwise regression analysis for the 25(OH)D3 concentration, significant predictors were outdoor temperature (estimate=0.02, p<0.0001), UVB radiation (estimate=-0.0015, p=0.02), year (2006 vs. 2005 estimate=-0.06, p>0.05, 2007 vs. 2005: estimate=-0.13, p<0.0001) and diabetes type (estimate=0.06, p=0.03). In conclusion, the strong correlation between UVB radiation and 25(OH)D3 concentrations in T2DM and GDM patients determines the seasonal variation. Additional determinants for the 25(OH)D3 concentrations were outdoor temperature, year, and diabetes type. Despite the effects of solar radiation both patients groups remain largely vitamin D deficient during summers.Copyright © Georg Thieme Verlag KG Stuttgart, New York.",Excluded
210,"Balloon-sacroplasty on patients with osteoporotic fatigue fractures. Introduction In patients with calcipenic osteopathy, fatigue fractures of the Os sacrum are relatively common and are typically accompanied by strong, disabling pain. The aim of our study was to verify the feasibility and safety of Sacroplasty by using a balloon catheter as well as the outcome of pain after the intervention. Material(s) and Method(s): 25 patients (20 women with an average age of 72.6 years, 5 men with an average age of 68.4 years) were diagnosed in a CT to have an Os sacrum fracture, in 12 women the fracture was unilateral, in the remaining patients bilateral. As a manifestation from an extant bone reconstruction process, all patients, through MRT strong T2 weighted images, were found to have distinctive oedema. In QCT results, all patients were found to have strong demineralisation of the vertebrae column with results from max 63mg/dl to min 13mg/dl, clinically, extreme pain is significant. On all patients, a CT controlled balloon sacroplasty was performed. During the intervention, the patient is in a ventral position, to enable the cement to be dispensed in a longitudinal angle to the fracture, and the balloon catheter is directed through a hollow needle in the Os sacrum either from the caudal to the cranial or from the craniodorsal to the caudoventral. The balloon catheter was accordingly de/inflated 1-3 times along the fracture in the appropriate direction, thus causing a cavity that was then filled with PMMA-cement under low pressure. A control-CT as well as a conventional X-ray was then carried out. The pain intensity was defined by means of VAS before the intervention, on the second day, after 6 and 12 months. Result(s): The balloon-sacroplasty enabled a good technical performance on every patient. The control-CT and the X-Ray control of the Os sacrum showed an adequate distribution of the cement, a cement leakage was not detected. Before the operation, the average pain encountered was according to the VAS 8.3. On the second postoperative day, a considerable reduction with an average of 2.7 was reported, this was still stable with an average of 2.5 after 6 and 12 months. Discussion(s): The Balloon-Sacroplasty is an effective treatment method for immediate pain relief and remobilisation in patients with fatigue fractures of the Os sacrum. Different approches as well as the utilisation of a balloon enables preferably large cement streams in the longitudinal direction of the fracture in the Os sacrums.",Excluded

1909,"Differential diagnosis of gallbladder ascariasis debris: the added value of contrast enhanced ultrasound with high frequency transducer. Ascariasis debris of the gallbladder is a very rare incidental or symptomatic presentation. Ascaris debris has a pseudotumorous appearance and may be confused with neoplasia. The aim of the current retrospective study is to investigate the value of contrast enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) for the differential diagnosis of ascariasis debris and neoplasia of the gallbladder., MATERIAL AND METHODS: Conventional B-mode ultrasound (BMUS) and CEUS were performed for solitary echo-rich gallbladder lesions. Analysis of the CEUS enhancement pattern of the lesions was conducted according to the current EFSUMB guidelines. Two radiologists assessed the CEUS enhancement patterns in consensus. The final gold standard was surgery with histological examination or imaging follow-up., RESULTS: A total of 9 patients with final diagnoses of gallbladder ascariasis debris were included. As a control group 26 solitary hyperechoic gallbladder lesions without shadowing were included as a control group. The typical zigzag morphology with multiple echogenic parallel lines without shadow were detected inside the lumen of the gallbladder in 6 patients. After injection of 2.4 ml ultrasound contrast agents, all hyperechoic gallbladder ascariasis debris lesions showed no enhancement. All patients in the control group with similar BMUS morphology showed contrast enhancement., CONCLUSIONS: Real time visualization of contrast enhancement without radiation exposure is one of the main advantages of CEUS over other diagnostic modalities to differentiate ascariasis debris in the gallbladder from enhancing neoplasia. Thus, surgery and other interventions and their complications could be avoided.",Excluded
673,"Chromosome aberrations induced by tritiated water or 60Co gamma-rays at early pronuclear stage in mouse eggs. The induction of chromosome aberrations in mouse eggs by exposure to HTO beta-particles and 60Co gamma-rays at the early pronuclear stage was examined at the first-cleavage metaphase by using an in vitro fertilization technique. Eggs at the pronuclear stage were exposed to beta-particles in a chemically defined medium containing tritiated water (HTO) for 2 h at 3-5 h after insemination. Other eggs at the same stage were exposed to gamma-rays from 60Co during the same period. The dose-response relationships for frequencies of chromosome aberrations per egg were fitted to a linear-quadratic model for HTO beta-particles, and to a linear model for 60Co gamma-rays. The chromosome aberrations were mainly chromosome-type, and the majority of all aberrations were fragments. RBE values of HTO beta-particles relative to 60Co gamma-rays and acute X-rays, which were estimated from the ratio of the linear regression coefficients over 0.05-Gy range, were 2.0 and 1.6, respectively.",Excluded

Objective: To evaluate the safety and effectiveness of the accurate puncture during sacral neuromodulation (SNM) guided with 3D printing navigation template based on reconstruction techniques using fusing sacral CT and MRI images. Method(s): Totally 42 patients operated with SNM were selected in Renji Hospital, School of Medicine, Shanghai Jiaotong University from July 2016 to August 2017. The patients were randomly divided into control group (n=22) and experimental group (n=20) using random number table. The conventional cross-positioning technique under X-ray was used for puncture during SNM in the control group. While in the experimental group, the sacral CT and MRI images were fused for reconstruction and design of the navigation template, printed by 3D technique for the puncture in SNM. The times of punctures, the average time for puncture operation, the time of intraoperative testing of the stimulator device, the minimum onset voltage of the stimulator, the X-ray radiation dose, postoperative curative effect (rate of secondary transformation) and the incidence rate of complications were compared between the two methods using independent-simple t test or chi2 test. Result(s): Compared to control group, fewer times of punctures, shorter time needed for puncture operation, shorter time of intraoperative testing of the stimulator, smaller radiation dose and minimum effective voltage were found in the experimental group (P<0.05). There were 15 and 16 patients who completed the secondary transformation in the control group and experimental group, and there was no significant difference between the two groups (chi2=0.757, P=0.384). There were 3 cases of complications in the control group, including 2 cases of infection and 1 case of bleeding, while no complications in the experimental group. Conclusion(s): CT and MRI images fusion reconstruction-guided 3D printing navigation template can help perform accurate and safe punctures in SNM. Compared to conventional puncture positioned under X-ray, it can effectively improve the puncture efficiency, and reduce the radiation dose in the operation.Copyright © 2021 Chinese Medical Association",Excluded
890,"The features of radiation induced lung fibrosis related with dosimetric parameters. BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Radiation induced lung fibrosis (RILF) is a major complication after lung irradiation and is very important for long term quality of life and could result in fatal respiratory insufficiency. However, there has been little information on dosimetric parameters for radiotherapy planning in the aspect of RILF. The features of RILF related with dosimetric parameters were evaluated., METHODS AND MATERIALS: Forty-eight patients with non-small cell lung carcinoma who underwent post-operative radiation therapy (PORT) without adjuvant chemotherapy were analyzed. The degree of lung fibrosis was estimated by fibrosis volume and the dosimetric parameters were calculated from the plan of 3-dimensional conformal radiotherapy., RESULTS: The fibrosis volume and V-dose as dosimetric parameters showed significant correlation and the correlation coefficient ranged from 0.602 to 0.683 (P<0.01). The degree of the correlation line was steeper as the dose increase and threshold dose was not found. Mean lung dose (MLD) showed strong correlation with fibrosis volume (correlation coefficient = 0.726, P<0.01)., CONCLUSIONS: The fibrosis volume is continuously increased with V-dose as the reference dose increases. MLD is useful as a single parameter for comparing rival plans in the aspect of RILF. Copyright © 2012 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.",Excluded
3400,"Use of neuronavigated transcranial magnetic stimulation and diffusion tensor imaging to avoid motor cortex complications in robotic stereotactic radiation therapy planning. Purpose/Objective(s): The purpose of this preliminary study was to find out if motor cortex and the motor tract can be avoided in robotic stereotactic radiation therapy/radiosurgery (RT/SRS) planning by using individually made maps from these areas. Materials/Methods: Before radiation therapy planning, the motor cortex was mapped from 2 meningioma patients using neuronavigated transcranial magnetic stimulation (nTMS) combined with a neuronavigation system. In addition, the descending motor pathways were determined with diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) tractography. Planning CT and MRI scans were also taken. Images were registered in treatment planning software by using a mutual image information algorithm and, in the case of nTMS, map manual registration via external markers. Two RT plans were made both with and without using the motor cortex and descending motor pathways as organs at risk (OARs). Dosimetric analysis was conducted comparing these plans with a focus on target coverage and motor cortex sparing. Result(s): Individual anatomical information from the motor cortex and motor pathways were imported into the RT planning system. Dosimetric analysis is described in Table 1. (Table Presented) Conclusion(s): For the 2 patients, the motor cortex and descending motor pathways were mapped before robotic stereotactic RT for meningioma. These are both noninvasive procedures and easy for the patients. The new OARs were able to be spared without compromising target irradiation. Sparing of the motor cortex and descending motor pathways was noticeable in their 0.01 mL maximum doses, being respectively 11.4% and 6.3% for patient 1 and 54.4% and 16.1% for patient 2. There were no differences in mean values, due the large volume of these OAR structures and the high dose gradients of the robotic stereotactic RT. Target coverage and mean dose were not affected by sparing of the motor cortex with either patient. With using this individual functional information to avoid motor cortex areas in RT planning we were able to spare selected patients from possible adverse effects without compromising target dose coverage. As the study is in a preliminary stage, in the future, motor area information will be mapped from more intracranial RT patients, and this information will be used to spare the motor area better than has thus far been possible. The potential RT-induced aftereffects will be studied during a follow-up period.",Excluded

3595,"A specific melon concentrate exhibits photoprotective effects from antioxidant activity in healthy adults. Skin is the largest body organ and the first barrier to exogenous threats. This organ is constantly exposed to external factors such as ultraviolet radiation, which induces many adverse effects including sunburn, depigmentation, photo aging, photo immune suppression, and even skin cancer. Antioxidants seem to be good candidates in order to reduce ultraviolet-mediated damages and to prevent the health consequences of ultraviolet exposure. The present investigation aims to further characterize the potential skin photoprotective effects of a food supplementation and a topical administration of a melon concentrate alone or in combination. A clinical study assessing the Minimal Erythema Dose (MED) was first set up to evaluate photoprotection. Afterward, an independent in vitro study was performed on human skin explants from a donor to evaluate the effect of the melon concentrate at different levels including on the sunburn cells formation and on the endogenous antioxidant enzymes and its influence on melanin. Clinical study results demonstrate that melon concentrate application and/or supplementation increased MED. It also increased the endogenous antioxidant enzymes and reduced sunburn cells and melanin level on irradiated skin explants. Therefore, it is suggested that melon concentrate administration (oral and/or topical) could be a useful strategy for photoprotection due to its antioxidant properties.Copyright © 2018 by the authors.

1794,"Is There a Role for Radiotherapy in the Primary Management of Primary Central Nervous System Lymphoma? A Single-centre Case Series. Aims: In recent years, the optimum primary management of primary central nervous system lymphoma (PCNSL) has evolved from combined modality chemoradiotherapy to chemotherapy alone. We describe a single-centre case series of PCNSL with a view to assessing the role of radiotherapy in primary disease management. Material(s) and Method(s): West of Scotland PCNSL cases between 2001 and 2010 were identified by neuropathology. Observational data were collected retrospectively from case notes and electronic systems. Result(s): Forty-nine patients fulfilled the eligibility criteria. The median age was 61 years. Chemotherapy with a view to consolidation radiotherapy on completion was delivered to 61% (. n=30). Regimens varied, but were generally methotrexate-based. Chemotherapy was discontinued prematurely in 80% (. n=24) due to progressive disease (. n=12), intolerable toxicity (. n=7) or death (. n=4). In all patients who progressed or did not tolerate chemotherapy, treatment was changed to immediate salvage radiotherapy; modal irradiation was 40Gy. Radiotherapy alone was delivered to those not suitable for chemotherapy (18%, n=9) and best supportive care to those with poor performance status (18%, n=9). The overall median survival was 8 months. In those receiving single modality radiotherapy or chemotherapy, the median survival was 5 and 8 months, respectively. For those completing chemoradiotherapy in its entirety, 3 year survival was 100%; in groups receiving salvage radiotherapy despite progressive disease or chemotherapy toxicity, moderate survival was maintained with immediate radiotherapy with 3 year survival rates of 33 and 60%, respectively. Conclusion(s): Although chemotherapy alone remains the optimal treatment of PCNSL, out with clinical trials only a minority of patients complete chemotherapy due to toxicity and disease progression; in such patients, immediate salvage radiotherapy provides an effective and safe alternative with maintenance of good outcomes. © 2013 The Royal College of Radiologists.",Excluded
2307,"[Malignant thyroid tumors in Hungary: morbidity and mortality]. In 1993, 181 new cases (36 men and 145 women) of thyroid cancer were diagnosed pathologically in Hungary, i.e. a morbidity of 1.8/100,000 for the total population, and of 0.7/100,000 and 2.7/100,000 for men and women, respectively. The distribution of the histological diagnoses: 61% papillary, 25% follicular, 5% medullary and 3% anaplastic carcinomas, and 6% others. In the same year, 125 patients (31 men and 94 women) died from thyroid cancer, i.e. a mortality rate of 1.2/100,000 for the total population, and of 0.6/100,000 and 1.8/100,000 for men and women, respectively. The relatively low morbidity reflects the fact that no new strong aetiological factor is operative in Hungary. The substantial mortality rate, however, is influenced by the geographically determined aggressivity of the disease, the inadequacy of the diagnostic procedures and therapeutic measures, and lack of the active follow-up. The latter facts are especially prominent in centres with a low patient turnover. In the field of health care, various measures must be introduced to prevent an increase in the morbidity and to diminish the mortality. Reduction of the iodine deficiency, rationalization of the medical use of ionizing irradiation, and implementation of the necessary hormonal medication for all patients operated by resection for thyroid diseases are needed for tumour prophylaxis. Before any medical decision-making, the achievement of complete diagnostic information, including the pathological revision of clinically questionable cases, is of paramount importance. The fundamental goals as concerns the treatment modalities are as follows: increased surgical skill and level of performance of external irradiation, the availability of radionuclide therapy, and guidance of all types of thyroxine medication by endocrine experts.",Excluded
165,"Low-dose abdominal computed tomography for detection of urinary stone disease - Impact of additional spectral shaping of the X-ray beam on image quality and dose parameters. OBJECTIVES: To evaluate a novel tin filter-based abdominal CT protocol for urolithiasis in terms of image quality and CT dose parameters., METHODS: 130 consecutive patients with suspected urolithiasis underwent non-enhanced CT with three different protocols: 48 patients (group 1) were examined at tin-filtered 150kV (150kV Sn) on a third-generation dual-source-CT, 33 patients were examined with automated kV-selection (110-140kV) based on the scout view on the same CT-device (group 2), and 49 patients were examined on a second-generation dual-source-CT (group 3) with automated kV-selection (100-140kV). Automated exposure control was active in all groups. Image quality was subjectively evaluated on a 5-point-likert-scale by two radiologists and interobserver agreement as well as signal-to-noise-ratio (SNR) was calculated. Dose-length-product (DLP) and volume CT dose index (CTDIvol) were compared., RESULTS: Image quality was rated in favour for the tin filter protocol with excellent interobserver agreement (ICC=0.86-0.91) and the difference reached statistical significance (p<0.001). SNR was significantly higher in group 1 and 2 compared to second-generation DSCT (p<0.001). On third-generation dual-source CT, there was no significant difference in SNR between the 150kV Sn and the automated kV selection protocol (p=0.5). The DLP of group 1 was 23% and 21% (p<0.002) lower in comparison to group 2 and 3, respectively. So was the CTDIvol of group 1 compared to group 2 (-36%) and 3 (-32%) (p<0.001)., CONCLUSION: Additional shaping of a 150kV source spectrum by a tin filter substantially lowers patient exposure while improving image quality on un-enhanced abdominal computed tomography for urinary stone disease.

955,"Capacity of primary hospitals for diabetes treatment in six Chinese provinces: A cross-sectional survey. Background Establishment of a hierarchical medical system is one of the major tasks outlined in China's ambitious health reform, and the ultimate success of this system depends on the treatment capacity of primary hospitals. Among the priorities of primary hospitals is the provision of quality services for chronic diseases, including diabetes, atypical and epidemic chronic disease in China. We aimed to estimate the capacity of primary hospitals for diabetes treatment in six Chinese provinces. Methods We did a cross-sectional survey in China using qualitative and quantitative methods. First, we interviewed 24 related experts (five primary hospital principals, six general practitioner, five drug experts, five medical device experts, two clinical experts, and one health system expert) to establish the capacity standard of primary hospital for diabetes treatment in the hierarchical medical system. Next, we surveyed the treatment capacity with regards to human resources, drug supply, and medical equipment in 28 primary hospitals (17 urban and 11 rural) in six provinces in China (Shanghai, Fujian, Hubei, Hunan, Sichuan, and Guizhou) between May 20 and July 12, 2016. Finally, we compared the survey results against the standard. We adopted purposive sampling, and used chi2 test and rank sum test for data analyses. Ethics approval was granted by Sichuan University, and all participants provided oral informed consent. Findings The primary hospitals surveyed had a mean of 1.76 general practitioners (SD 2.03) per million residents. The mean number of general practitioners per million residents was 1.48 (1.18) for rural hospitals and 1.92 (2.41) for urban hospitals, which were lower than the standard (2-3, based on the expert interviews and policy review). 11 (65%) urban primary hospitals provided three or more types of drugs, compared with four (36%) rural primary hospitals. Urban primary hospitals had a mean of 8.35 (SD 4.44) types of diabetes drugs and rural ones had 4.45 (3.33), although expert interviews and policy reviews indicated that primary hospitals need provide seven types of drugs that are often used in the clinic. 27 (96%) primary hospitals provided metformin, 26 (93%) sulfonylureas, 18 (64%) alphaglucosidase inhibitors, 16 (57%) insulin, 15 (54%) hypoglycaemic proprietary Chinese medicine, 11 (39%) glinides, and nine (32%) thiazolidinediones; newer antidiabetic drugs such as DPP-4 inhibitors, SGLT2 inhibitors, and GLP-1 receptor agonists were scarcely supplied. All 28 primary hospitals were equipped with blood glucose meters, blood pressure instruments, and electrocardiograph machines; 25 (89%) had biochemical analysers, 27 (96%) B ultrasound machines, 20 (71%) colour Doppler ultrasound machines and x-ray machines, and eight (29%) fundus mirrors, while expert interviews showed that primary hospitals should have with all of these equipment. No significant difference in availability of medical equipment was recorded between rural and urban primary hospitals (p>0.05). Interpretation Primary hospitals in China, especially those in rural areas, do not have sufficient human resources and drugs for diabetes treatment, although they generally have adequate medical equipment. Strategies to enhance the capacity of primary hospitals for diabetes treatment need to increase the number of health-care workers and drug supply.",Excluded
3403,"Dietary carotenoids contribute to normal human skin color and UV photosensitivity. The aim of the current study was to determine whether dietary carotenoids influence skin pigmentation and UV photosensitivity in a healthy unsupplemented panel (n = 22) of Caucasian (skin Type II) subjects. Skin spectrophotometric and tristimulus (L*a*b*) CR200 chromameter readings were made at various body sites to objectively measure skin carotenoid levels and skin color, respectively. The minimal erythemal dose (MED) was also measured to determine the intrinsic UV photosensitivity of the skin. We found that tristimulus b* values (but not L* and a* values) were consistently and closely correlated with skin carotenoid levels at a number of body sites including the back (r = 0.85, P < 0.00001), forehead (r = 0.85, P < 0.00001), inner forearm (r = 0.75, P < 0.0001) and palm of the hand (r = 0.78, P < 0.0001). Skin carotenoid levels and MED were also correlated in these subjects (r = 0.66, P < 0.001), as were tristimulus b* values and MED (r = 0.71, P < 0.0002). From these observations, we conclude that carotenoids from a normal, unsupplemented diet accumulate in the skin and confer a measurable photoprotective benefit (at least in lightly pigmented Caucasian skin), that is directly linked to their concentration in the tissue. Carotenoids also appear to contribute measurably and significantly to normal human skin color, in particular the appearance of yellowness"" as defined objectively by CR200 tristimulus b* values. On the basis of these findings we believe that objective measurements of skin color, in particular tristimulus b* values, may be a potentially useful means of monitoring dietary carotenoid status and assessing UV photosensitivity in Caucasian populations.""",Excluded
82,"A high lymph node ratio predicts loco-regional recurrence while microscopic N2 predicts survival after radiation therapy in pIIIA-N2 non-small cell lung cancer. Objective: Post-operative management of pIIIA-N2 non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is still debated. Our objective was to identify subgroups of patients who could benefit from treatment based on invaded lymph node ratio (LNR). Method(s): From January 2003 to December 2012, 297 pIIIA-N2 NSCLC patients treated with surgery followed by conformational radiation therapy (RT) were retrospectively analysed. Result(s): Median follow-up time was 30 months. A correlation was observed between LNR and overall survival (OS) (R = -0.3, p < 0.0001), local relapse (R = -0.27, p < 0.0001) and extra-capsular spread (ECS) (Cramer's V = 0.49, p < 0.0001). In univariate analysis, OS was significantly lower in patients with LNR higher than 1/3 (median survival 61 +/- 6.5 vs. 28 +/- 3.8 months, p < 0.0001). In multivariate analysis, favourable prognostic factors for OS were a LNR <1/3 (HR = 0.53, 95 % CI 0.33-0.85, p = 0.009) and microscopic N2 (HR = 0.56, 95 % CI 0.35-0.90, p = 0.01). For local relapse, multivariate analysis identified the following risk factors: female gender (HR = 2.41, CI 1.36-4.27, p = 0.003), microscopic N2 (HR = 0.40, CI 0.2-0.81, p = 0.01) and a LNR of lower than 2/3 (HR = 0.18, CI 0.07-0.48, p = 0.001). Conclusion(s): Our study supports that LNR is likely related to OS and loco-regional recurrence. Furthermore, microscopic N2 seems to be associated with a better prognosis.Copyright © 2015, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.",Excluded
3088,"Iodine-125 brachytherapy as upfront and salvage treatment for brain metastases : A comparative analysis. BACKGROUND: Outcome and toxicity profiles of salvage stereotactic ablative radiation strategies for recurrent pre-irradiated brain metastases are poorly defined. This study compared risk-benefit profiles of upfront and salvage iodine-125 brachytherapy (SBT) for small brain metastases. As the applied SBT treatment algorithm required histologic proof of metastatic brain disease in all patients, we additionally aimed to elucidate the value of biopsy before SBT., PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients with small untreated (n = 20) or pre-irradiated (n =28) suspected metastases intended for upfront or salvage SBT, respectively, were consecutively included. Temporary iodine-125 implants were used (median reference dose: 50 Gy, median dose rate: 15 cGy/h). Cumulative biologically effective doses (BED) were calculated and used for risk assessment. Treatment toxicity was classified according to Radiation Therapy Oncology Group/European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (RTOG/EORTC) criteria., RESULTS: Upfront SBT was initiated in 20 patients and salvage SBT in 23. In 5 patients, salvage SBT was withheld because of proven radiation-induced lesions. Treatment groups exhibited similar epidemiologic data except for tumor size (which was slightly smaller in the salvage group). One-year local/distant tumor control rates after upfront and salvage SBT were similar (94 %/65 % vs. 87 %/57 %, p = 0.45, respectively). Grade I/II toxicity was suffered by 2 patients after salvage SBT (cumulative BED: 192.1 Gy3 and 249.6 Gy3). No toxicity-related risk factors were identified., CONCLUSION: SBT combines diagnostic yield with effective treatment in selected patients. The low toxicity rate in the salvage group points to protective radiobiologic characteristics of continuous low-dose rate irradiation. Upfront and salvage SBT are similarly effective and safe. Histologic reevaluation should be reconsidered after previous radiotherapy to avoid under- or overtreatment.",Excluded
2457,"Measuring Corneal Haze by Using Scheimpflug Photography and Confocal Microscopy. PURPOSE: We compared corneal backscatter estimated from a Scheimpflug camera with backscatter estimated from a clinical confocal microscope across a wide range of corneal haze., METHODS: A total of 59 corneas from 35 patients with a range of severity of Fuchs' endothelial corneal dystrophy and 15 corneas from 9 normal participants were examined using a Scheimpflug camera (Pentacam) and a confocal microscope (ConfoScan 4). The mean image brightness from the anterior 120 mum, midcornea, and posterior 60 mum of the cornea across the central 2 mm recorded by the Scheimpflug camera and analogous regions from the confocal microscope were measured and standardized. Differences between instruments and correlations between backscatter and disease severity were determined by using generalized estimating equation models., RESULTS: Backscatter measured by the two instruments in the anterior and midcornea were correlated (r = 0.67 and 0.43, respectively, P < 0.001), although in the posterior cornea they were not correlated (r = 0.13, P = 0.66). Measured with the Scheimpflug camera, mean backscatter from the anterior and midcornea were greater, whereas backscatter from the posterior cornea was lower (P < 0.001) than that measured by the confocal microscope. Backscatter from the anterior cornea was correlated with disease severity for both instruments (Scheimpflug, r = 0.55, P < 0.001; confocal, r = 0.49, P = 0.003)., CONCLUSIONS: The Scheimpflug camera and confocal microscope should not be used interchangeably to measure corneal haze. The ability to detect changes in backscatter with disease severity is superior with the Scheimpflug camera. However, the confocal microscope provides higher resolution of corneal structure.",Excluded
3200,"Does race influence survival for esophageal cancer patients treated on the radiation and chemotherapy arm of RTOG 85-01?. Purpose: In reported retrospective non-randomized trials of treatment of esophageal carcinoma, blacks have a lower survival from esophageal cancer than whites. None of these studies has accounted for the extent of disease, or the methods and quality of treatment. We reviewed the data that included only patients treated on the chemoradiation arm of the RTOG-8501 esophageal carcinoma trial to see if there were differences in overall survival between black and white patients receiving the same standard of care. Methods and Materials: One hundred-nineteen patients, 37 blacks and 82 whites were evaluated who met the criteria for receiving chemoradiation of 5000 cGy and four courses of Cisplatin (75 mg/m2) and Fluorouracil (1000 mg/m2 for 4 days). Result(s): Blacks had squamous histology only, with 86% of blacks having weight loss of 10 lbs. or more compared to 56% of whites (p = 0.001). In addition, blacks had larger tumors and more difficulty eating (p = 0.010). Overall, there was no difference in the Kaplan-Meier median survival estimate by race (p = 0.2757). Only when we limited the analysis to the 'squamous histology' subgroup, stratified according to age >70 vs. <70 years (p = 0.0002), and nodal status (p = 0.0177) in a Cox regression model analysis, did race appear to be a significant factor (p = 0.0012). However, using the entire database, the age effect was found to be a 'bimodal' effect, wherein the 'youngest' ( 70 years) did poorly. Because of the dramatic differences in the age and histology distributions between blacks and whites, this issue could not be resolved in the subset of squamous only who received chemoradiation. Conclusion(s): The increasing incidence of adenocarcinoma among white patients without a corresponding increase of this histology in blacks reflects a difference in diet and or lifestyle compared to blacks that deserves additional study. When treated aggressively with chemoradiation, race did not appear to be a statistically significant factor for overall survival.",Excluded
2939,"Thyroid and parathyroid function in long-term survivors of stem cell transplantation after 10-14Gy total body irradiation. Thyroid and parathyroid dysfunction are well described complications of irradiation to the neck. In this study we have evaluated the incidence of thyroid and parathyroid dysfunction in long term survivors of SCT attending a dedicated haematology/ endocrine follow-up clinic. All patients were transplanted for haematological malignancy and had total body irradiation (TBI) as part of their pre-transplant conditioning regimen. 76 patients (37 female) were investigated a median of 18 years post SCT (range 8-29). The median dose of TBI was 12Gy (range 10-14) given in conjunction with cyclophosphamide. 61 patients were treated for CML and 15 patients were treated for acute leukemia. 21 out of 76 patients (28%) developed hypothyroidism and there were no cases of hyperthyroidism. Among male patients the prevalence was 26% compared to <1% in normal populations. Among women the prevalence was 30% compared to a normal prevalence of 0.1-2%. The median time after SCT that hypothyroidism developed was 13 years but the range was wide at 4.5-24 years. None of our patients had laboratory evidence of hypoparathyroidism (low calcium with inappropriately non-elevated PTH). 16 patients had a raised PTH level. Of these, 12/16 had a calcium level in the lower end of the normal range (2.16-2.4 mmol/l) making primary hyperparathyroidism unlikely. The majority (11/12) of these patients had low vitamin D levels making secondary hyperparathyroidism the most likely diagnosis. Of four patients with elevated PTH and calcium levels >2.4 mmol/ l, none had convincing evidence of primary hyperparathyroidism. One patient had renal impairment and secondary/tertiary hyperparathyroidism; a second was taking bendrofluazide; a third was vitamin D deficient. A fourth patient was hypocalciuric with a 24 hour urinary calcium/creatinine ratio <0.01; this excludes primary hyperparathyroidism and makes the diagnosis of familial hypocalciuric hypercalcemia likely. In summary, there was a high prevalence of hypothyroidism (28%) among our patients. Conversely there were no cases of primary hyperparathyroidism or hypoparathyroidism but longer follow up will be necessary to clarify the effect of these doses of TBI on parathyroid function. Secondary hyperparathyroidism was frequent, particularly in association with low vitamin D levels. We conclude that indefinite surveillance is needed to identify thyroid dysfunction after SCT and vitamin D levels should be part of routine annual follow up investigations.",Excluded

1891,"Potential for radiation dose savings in abdominal and chest CT using automatic tube voltage selection in combination with automatic tube current modulation. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the simultaneous use of automatic tube current modulation (ATCM) and automatic tube voltage selection (ATVS) for abdominal and chest CT examinations regarding radiation dose reduction and image quality., MATERIALS AND METHODS: We enrolled 617 patients who all underwent contrast-enhanced chest or abdominal CT and divided them into two groups. In group A, 317 patients who underwent CT with only ATCM and a fixed body mass index-adjusted tube voltage (120 kV or 100 kV) were enrolled. In group B, both ATCM and ATVS were used. Image attenuation and noise were measured in different anatomic regions., RESULTS: The mean contrast-to-noise ratio and the signal-to-noise ratio of abdomen and chest CT was higher in group B compared with group A (p < 0.0001). In total, the effective radiation doses for abdomen and chest CT examinations were significantly reduced in group B by 18% compared with group A (p < 0.0001). When only examining those who benefited from the ATVS tool, a dose reduction of 35% for chest CT and 42% for abdomen CT could be achieved (p < 0.0001 for each)., CONCLUSION: The simultaneous use of ATVS and ATCM enables significant radiation dose reduction in abdominal and thoracic contrast-enhanced CT examinations compared with the use of ATCM alone.",Excluded
2395,"Spine stereotactic body radiotherapy for renal cell cancer spinal metastases: Analysis of outcomes and risk of vertebral compression fracture. Object. The aim of this study was to evaluate local control (LC) and the risk of vertebral compression fracture (VCF) after stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) in patients with renal cell cancer spinal metastases. Methods. Prospectively collected data on 71 spinal segments treated with SBRT in 37 patients were reviewed. The median follow-up was 12.3 months (range 1.2-55.4 months). The LC rate was assessed based on each spinal segment treated and overall survival (OS) according to each patient treated. Sixty of 71 segments (85%) were radiation naive, 11 of 71 (15%) were previously irradiated, and 10 of 71 (14%) were treated with postoperative SBRT. The median SBRT total dose and number of fractions were 24 Gy and 2, respectively. The VCF analysis also included evaluation of the Spinal Instability Neoplastic Score criteria. Results. The 1-year OS and LC rates were 64% and 83%, respectively. Multivariate analysis identified oligometastatic disease (13 of 37 patients) as a positive prognostic factor (p = 0.018) for OS. Of 61 non-postoperative spinal segments treated, 10 (16%) developed VCFs; 3 of 10 were de novo VCFs and 7 of 10 occurred as progression of an existing VCF. The 1-year VCF-free probability rate was 82%. Multivariate analysis identified single-fraction SBRT and baseline VCF as significant predictors of SBRT-induced VCF (p = 0.028 and p = 0.012, respectively). Conclusions. Spine SBRT yields high rates of local tumor control in patients with renal cell cancer. Baseline VCF and 18-24 Gy delivered in a single fraction were predictive of further collapse. Patients with oligometastatic disease may benefit most from such aggressive local therapy, given the prolonged survival observed.Copyright © AANS, 2014.",Excluded
614,"Exclusive moderate-dose radiotherapy in gastric marginal zone B-cell MALT lymphoma: Results of a prospective study with a long term follow-up. Background In gastric MALT lymphomas persisting after Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) eradication, a treatment by moderate-dose radiotherapy (RT) has been proposed but its efficacy has not been confirmed in large prospective series with long term endoscopic follow-up. Method Patients with localised gastric MALT lymphoma persisting after H. pylori eradication were offered moderate-dose RT (30 Gy, 2 Gy/fraction) and followed with annual endoscopies. All biopsies before and after RT were reviewed by a committee of pathologists. Results From 1995 to 2011, out of the 232 patients followed prospectively, 53 received RT for persistence of lymphoma after H. pylori eradication: either macroscopic ulcer (n = 31), or microscopic lymphomatous infiltrate (n = 22), after a mean follow-up of 12 and 31 months, respectively. All lymphomas were localised (45 stage IE and 8 stage IIE) and 38 (72%) were H. pylori-positive. The mean clinical and endoscopic follow-up from diagnosis was 7.6 years (2.2-19.1). No acute or late toxicity occurred. A complete remission was achieved in all patients but one (98%) with no relapse after a median follow-up of 4.9 years (1.3-16.6) after completion of RT. Overall survival and 5-year disease specific survival were 94% and 100%, respectively. One patient died of gastric adenocarcinoma. Conclusion Moderate-dose RT (30 Gy) is effective and safe for localised gastric MALT lymphoma persisting after H. pylori eradication.Copyright © 2015 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

1581,"Effect of topical melatonin on ultraviolet radiation-induced suppression of Mantoux reactions in humans. BACKGROUND: Melatonin, the central neurohormone in circadian rhythm pathways, is recognized to have a variety of immune-enhancing effects. It has previously been shown to reduce ultraviolet (UV) radiation-induced erythema in mice and in humans, but there are as yet no published studies on the effects of melatonin on UV-induced immunosuppression in humans., METHODS: We investigated the effects of topical melatonin on solar-simulated (ss) UV-induced suppression of Mantoux reactions in 16 healthy, Mantoux-positive volunteers. Melatonin (5%) and its vehicle were applied in a double-blinded manner to separate areas on the lower back, immediately after each of three consecutive daily ssUV exposures. Various sites on the back received either no irradiation or one of three-graded ssUV doses. Mantoux testing was performed at each site 24 h after the final irradiation, and assessed 72 h later using a reflectance erythema meter. In a separate group of 19 volunteers, the effect of melatonin on minimal erythema dose was assessed both visually and with an erythema meter., RESULTS: We found dose-responsive UV-induced suppression of the Mantoux response in the presence of both vehicle and melatonin; melatonin did not prevent UV-induced immunosuppression in this model. Melatonin was also found to have no effect on the minimal erythema dose., CONCLUSIONS: Melatonin conferred no protection against immune suppression or sunburn when applied topically to human skin immediately after irradiation.",Excluded
1244,"Ultra-low-dose thoracic CT with model-based iterative reconstruction (MBIR) in cystic fibrosis patients undergoing treatment with cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulators (CFTR). AIM: To assess the utility of a volumetric low-dose computed tomography (CT) thorax (LDCTT) protocol at a dose equivalent to a posteroanterior (PA) and lateral chest radiograph for surveillance of cystic fibrosis (CF) patients. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A prospective study was undertaken of 19 adult patients with CF that proceeded to LDCTT at 12 and 24 months following initiation of ivacaftor. A previously validated seven-section, low-dose axial CT protocol was used for the 12-month study. A volumetric LDCTT protocol was developed for the 24-month study and reconstructed with hybrid iterative reconstruction (LD-ASIR) and pure iterative reconstruction (model-based IR [LD-MBIR]). Radiation dose was recorded for each scan. Image quality was assessed quantitatively and qualitatively, and disease severity was assessed using a modified Bhalla score. Statistical analysis was performed and p-values of <0.05 were considered statistically significant. RESULT(S): Volumetric LD-MBIR studies were acquired at a lower radiation dose than the seven-section studies (0.08 +/- 0.01 versus 0.10 +/- 0.02 mSv; p=0.02). LD-MBIR and seven-section ASIR images had significantly lower levels of image noise compared with LD-ASIR images (p<0.0001). Diagnostic acceptability scores and depiction of bronchovascular structures were found to be acceptable for axial and coronal LD-MBIR images. LD-MBIR images were superior to LD-ASIR images for all qualitative parameters assessed (p<0.0001). No significant change was observed in mean Bhalla score between 1-year and 2-year studies (p=0.84). CONCLUSION(S): The use of a volumetric LDCTT protocol (reconstructed with pure IR) enabled acquisition of diagnostic quality CT images, which were considered extremely useful for surveillance of CF patients, at a dose equivalent to a PA and lateral chest radiograph.Copyright © 2021 The Royal College of Radiologists",Excluded
935,"CT in necrotizing soft tissue infection: diagnostic criteria and comparison with LRINEC score. Objective: To investigate which computed tomography (CT) criteria are most useful in diagnosing necrotizing soft tissue infection (NSTI) and how CT performs with respect to the Laboratory Risk Indicator for Necrotizing Fasciitis (LRINEC) score. Method(s): Patients who underwent CT for suspected NSTI were eligible for inclusion. LRINEC score was assessed. CT scans were evaluated for subcutaneous edema, fluid along superficial fascia, fluid along deep fascia, blurring of intermuscular fat planes, fluid collection, and air in the soft tissues. Surgical findings or clinical follow-up served as reference standard. Result(s): Fourteen patients with NSTI and 34 patients with non-NSTI were included. LRINEC score was significantly higher in patients with NSTI (median of 7.5 vs. 6, p = 0.039). Fluid along the deep fascia was significantly more frequently present in patients with NSTI (46.2% vs. 5.9%, p = 0.001). In multiple logistic regression analysis, presence of fluid along the deep fascia was significantly associated with NSTI (odds ratio [OR] = 10.28, 95% CI: 1.57 to 67.18, p = 0.015), whereas the LRINEC score was not significantly associated with NSTI (OR = 1.27, 95% CI: 0.92 to 1.74, p = 0.146). Using presence of fluid along the deep fascia as diagnostic criterion for NSTI, sensitivity was 46.2% (95% CI, 23.2 to 70.9%) and specificity was 94.1% (95% CI, 80.9 to 98.4%). Conclusion(s): Fluid along the deep fascia was the only CT criterion which was significantly associated with NSTI and appeared more useful than the LRINEC score. In the right clinical setting, presence of this CT finding is highly suggestive for NSTI. Its absence, however, does not rule out NSTI. Key Points: * The presence of fluid along the deep fascia at CT is highly suggestive for NSTI in suspected patients. Its absence, however, does not rule out NSTI. `* The use of fluid along the deep fascia as a criterion appears to be more useful than the LRINEC score in diagnosing NSTI.Copyright © 2021, European Society of Radiology.",Excluded
2235,"Implications for preserving neural stem cells in whole brain radiotherapy and prophylactic cranial irradiation: A review of 2270 metastases in 488 patients. This study delineated the incidence of metastatic involvement of neural stem cell (NSC) regions and further aimed to explore the feasibility of selectively sparing the NSC compartments during whole brain radiotherapy (WBRT) and prophylactic cranial irradiation (PCI). A total of 2270 intracranial metastases in 488 patients were identified. Lesions were classified according to locations, including lesions in the NSC compartments (subventricular zone, SVZ, or hippocampus) and those in the rest of the brain/brainstem. The incidence of involvement of NSC regions was compared between oligometastatic patients (those with 14 lesions) and non-oligometastatic patients (those with 5 or more lesions) using a chi-square test. The volume of the NSC regions accounted for 2.23% of the whole brain, and the overall rate of metastatic lesions in NSC regions was 1.1% in 2270 metastases (25/2270), and 4.7% in 488 patients (23/488). Of the NSC region metastases, 7 (0.3%) involved the hippocampus and 18 (0.8%) occurred in the SVZ. Among the 7 hippocampal metastases identified in this study, 1/7 (14.3%) were found in oligometastatic patients, while 6/7 (85.7%) metastases were in non-oligometastatic patients. For metastases in the SVZ, all lesions occurred in non-oligometastatic patients with none in oligometastatic patients. Metastatic involvement of the NSC compartments was significantly lower in oligometastatic patients (0.15%, 1/670) than in non-oligometastatic patients (1.5%, 24/1600) (P < 0.001). Our retrospective review of 2270 metastases in 488 patients is that the volume of the compartments of NSC regions was 2.23% relative to the whole brain, but the incidence of involvement of the NSC compartments was 1.1%, and the vast majority of NSC lesions were found in nonoligometastatic patients. We believe our data supports selective reduction of doses for these aforementioned structures, when treating oligometastatic patients with WBRT and locally advanced-stage small-cell lung cancer patients with PCI. © The Author 2012.

280,"Comparison of V/Q SPECT and planar V/Q lung scintigraphy in diagnosing acute pulmonary embolism. PURPOSE: Planar ventilation/perfusion (V/Q) scintigraphy is currently the standard method for the diagnosis of pulmonary embolism (PE) in most nuclear medicine centers. However, recent studies have shown a superior sensitivity and specificity when applying V/Q single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) in diagnosing PE. This study evaluated the diagnostic performance of three-dimensional V/Q SPECT in comparison with planar V/Q scintigraphy., MATERIALS AND METHODS: Consecutive patients suspected of acute PE from June 2006 to February 2008 were referred to the Department of Nuclear Medicine at Frederiksberg Hospital, Denmark to a V/Q SPECT, as the first-line imaging procedure. Patients with positive D-dimer (>0.5 mg/l) or after clinical assessment with a Wells score of more than 2 were included and had a V/Q SPECT, low-dose CT, planar V/Q scintigraphy, and pulmonary multidetector computer tomography angiography performed the same day. Ventilation studies were performed using Kr. Patient follow-up was at least 6 months., RESULTS: A total of 36 patient studies were available for analysis, of which 11 (31%) had PE. V/Q SPECT had a sensitivity of 100% and a specificity of 87%. Planar V/Q scintigraphy had a sensitivity of 64% and a specificity of 72%., CONCLUSION: We conclude that V/Q SPECT has a superior diagnostic performance compared with planar V/Q scintigraphy and should be preferred when diagnosing PE.",Excluded

We examined the association between citrus consumption and subsequent incident malignant melanoma among participants in the Nurses' Health Study (1984-2010) and the Health Professionals Follow-up Study (1986-2010). Among 105,437 participants over 2 million person-years of follow-up, we documented 1857 incident melanomas. The pooled multivariate-adjusted hazard ratio for melanoma comparing the extreme total citrus consumption categories (1.5 or more serving per day vs. less than twice per week) was 1.30 (95 confidence interval [CI], 1.08 to 1.57) (P=0.003 for trend). Grapefruit and orange juice were two individual citrus products that showed significant associations with risk of melanoma. The pooled multivariate-adjusted hazard ratios for melanoma were 1.41 (95% CI, 1.09 to 1.82) comparing the extreme consumption categories of grapefruit (three times or more per week vs. never, P=0.004 for trend) and 1.26 (95% CI, 1.02 to 1.56) comparing the extreme consumption categories of orange juice (once or more per day vs. never, P=0.001 for trend). Significant positive associations between citrus consumption and risk of melanoma were also observed for invasive melanoma and melanoma that occurred on the head, neck and extremities, and among participants who spent more time in direct sunlight since high school and resided in areas with higher solar ultraviolet radiation in the US.

1487,"Increased evidence for the prognostic value of FDG uptake on late-treatment PET in non-tumour-affected oesophagus in irradiated patients with oesophageal carcinoma. PURPOSE: 18F-FDG uptake in irradiated non-tumour-affected oesophagus (NTO) on restaging PET is a potential surrogate for the measurement of radiation-induced inflammation. Radiation-induced inflammation itself has been shown to be of high prognostic relevance in patients undergoing preoperative radiochemotherapy (RCT) for locally advanced oesophageal cancer. We assessed the prognostic relevance of FDG uptake in the NTO in an independent cohort of patients treated with definitive RCT., METHODS: This retrospective evaluation included 72 patients with oesophageal squamous cell carcinoma treated with definitive RCT with curative intent. All patients underwent pretreatment and restaging FDG PET after receiving a radiation dose of 40-50 Gy. Standardized uptake values (SUVmax/SUVmean), metabolic tumour volume (MTV) and relative changes from pretreatment to restaging PET (SUVmax/SUVmean) were determined within the tumour and NTO. Univariate Cox regression with respect to overall survival (OS), local control (LC), distant metastases (DM) and treatment failure (TF) was performed. Independence of parameters was tested by multivariate Cox regression., RESULTS: SUVmax NTO and MTV were prognostic factors for all investigated clinical endpoints (OS, LC, DM, TF). Inclusion of clinical and PET tumour parameters in multivariate analysis showed that SUVmax NTO was an independent prognostic factor. Furthermore, multivariate analysis of SUVmax NTO using previously published cut-off values from preoperatively treated patients revealed that SUVmax NTO was independent prognostic factor for OS (HR = 1.88, p = 0.038), TF (HR = 2.11, p = 0.048) and DM (HR = 3.02, p = 0.047)., CONCLUSION: NTO-related tracer uptake during the course of treatment in patients with oesophageal carcinoma was shown to be of high prognostic relevance. Thus, metabolically activity of NTO measured in terms of SUVmax NTO is a potential candidate for future treatment individualization (i.e. organ preservation).",Excluded

1479,"Determination of physical parameters associated with self-efficacy in patients with chronic mechanic low back pain. BACKGROUND: Self-efficacy that is associated with various pain-related disabilities such as chronic low back pain (LBP), should be questioned besides physical assessments. OBJECTIVE(S): To investigate the physical factors associated with self-efficacy in patients with chronic mechanic LBP. METHOD(S): One hundred nine patients diagnosed as chronic mechanic LBP (65 females, 44 males) between 20-50 years old were included to this study. The intensity of LBP was assessed by using a 10-cm Visual Analogue Scale. For musculoskeletal fitness measurement; muscle strength, muscle endurance, and flexibility tests were applied. Functional Reach Test for balance evaluation, Self-Efficacy Scale for self-efficacy measurement, Roland-Morris Disability Questionnaire for disability level evaluation were used. RESULT(S): We found a moderate negative correlation between self-efficacy and pain intensity (r=-0.506); a negative and strong correlation between self-efficacy and disability level (r=-0.654) (p< 0.05). Self efficacy had a significant association with right (r= 0.265) and left (r= 0.290) lateral side bending flexibility (p< 0.05). According to multiple regression analysis results, it was found that disability level had a significant effect on self-efficacy (beta=-2.014; p< 0.01).

BACKGROUND: Accumulating evidence suggests that brachial plexopathy following head and neck cancer radiotherapy may be underreported and that this toxicity is associated with a dose-response. Our purpose was to determine whether the dose to the brachial plexus (BP) can be constrained, without compromising regional control., METHODS: The radiation plans of 324 patients with oropharyngeal carcinoma (OPC) treated with intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) were reviewed. We identified 42 patients (13%) with gross nodal disease <1 cm from the BP. Normal tissue constraints included a maximum dose of 66 Gy and a D05 of 60 Gy for the BP. These criteria took precedence over planning target volume (PTV) coverage of nodal disease near the BP., RESULTS: There was only one regional failure in the vicinity of the BP, salvaged with neck dissection (ND) and regional re-irradiation. There have been no reported episodes of brachial plexopathy to date., CONCLUSIONS: In combined-modality therapy, including ND as salvage, regional control did not appear to be compromised by constraining the dose to the BP. This approach may improve the therapeutic ratio by reducing the long-term risk of brachial plexopathy.",Excluded

321,"Treatment of symptomatic atrial tachycardia in complex anatomic conditions: Use and outcome of ablation in patients after damus-kaye-stansel surgery. Background: Atrial tachycardias (AT) are amongst the most frequent complications in adult patients with congenital heart disease (ACHD). Their incidence mainly depends on age and complexity of underlying defect. AT has a marked impact on morbidity and mortality and is associated with sudden cardiac death particularly in complex ACHD patients. The arrhythmic substrate can be variable from re-entry to multifocal resulting in demanding requirements for electrophysiologic ablation procedures (EP) and thus, relatively high rates of recurrence. Methods and Results: Retrospective analysis of ACHD patients with prior Damus-Kaye-Stansel (DKS) surgery treated at one of the largest specialized tertiary centers for ACHD patients worldwide. Analysis focussed on occurrence of AT, respective treatment and outcome of EP. Over a median observation time of 15 years, 13 patients with prior DKS surgery and complex congenital heart defects of different types but uniformly Fontan circulation, were identified (median age 22.0 years (IQR 20.5 - 25.5), 76.9% male, 92.3% NYHA Class I, median systemic ventricular ejection fraction 58.5%, 69.2% extracardiac tunnel). Seven patients (53.8%) presented with symptomatic AT (median cyclic length 440 ms (IQR 360.0 - 517.5)). Of these, six patients underwent EP. Median procedure time was 180.5 min (IQR 160.8 - 274.5), median fluoroscopy time 1.56 min (IQR 0.51 - 4.73) and radiofrequency time 851 sec (265.0 -2005.0). Remote magnetic navigation was used to access ablation site through a retrograde access via the aortic as well as the neo-aortic valve. Three-dimensional image integration aided in mapping and ablation. Throughout the procedure as well as in follow-up visits, no reportable complications were observed. After a mean of 1.5 procedures, all analysed patients stayed complaint-free throughout a median time-interval of 13 months. Conclusion(s): AT are frequent in complex univentricular situations after Damus-Kaye-Stansel surgery (53.8%). Although more than one procedure (mean 1.5) was necessary to achieve satisfactory results even in experienced hands, EP appears to be an appropriate treatment strategy in this young and otherwise healthy patient cohort. According to our analysis, EP is feasible and safe in centers with knowledge of specific anatomic characteristics of congenital heart disease and when the appropriate technical infrastructure is present. Access to ablation site was performed by remote magnetic navigation in the majority of procedures. The floppy catheter was navigated through the neo-aortic as well as through the aortic valve without observable peri- or postinterventional complications. Mapping with three-dimensional image integration facilitated EP and led to a relatively low radiation exposure with the known benefits for the patient as well as for the healthcare professionals involved in the procedure.",Excluded
1929,"Detectability of radiation-induced changes in magnetic resonance biomarkers following stereotactic radiosurgery: A pilot study. Our objective was to investigate direct voxel-wise relationship between dose and early MR biomarker changes both within and in the high-dose region surrounding brain metastases following stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS). Specifically, we examined the apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) from diffusion-weighted imaging and the contrast transfer coefficient (Ktrans) and volume of extracellular extravascular space (ve) derived from dynamic contrast-enhanced (DCE) MRI data. We investigated 29 brain metastases in 18 patients using 3 T MRI to collect imaging data at day 0, day 3 and day 20 following SRS. The ADC maps were generated by the scanner and Ktrans and ve maps were generated using in-house software for dynamic tracer-kinetic analysis. To enable spatially-correlated voxel-wise analysis, we developed a registration pipeline to register all ADC, Ktrans and ve maps to the planning MRI scan. To interrogate longitudinal changes, we computed absolute DELTAADC, DELTAKtrans and DELTAve for day 3 and 20 post-SRS relative to day 0. We performed a Kruskall-Wallice test on each biomarker between time points and investigated dose correlations within the gross tumour volume (GTV) and surrounding high dose region > 12 Gy via Spearman's rho. Only ve exhibited significant differences between day 0 and 20 (p < 0.005) and day 3 and 20 (p < 0.05) within the GTV following SRS. Strongest dose correlations were observed for ADC within the GTV (rho = 0.17 to 0.20) and weak correlations were observed for ADC and Ktrans in the surrounding > 12 Gy region. Both DELTAKtrans and DELTAve showed a trend with dose at day 20 within the GTV and > 12 Gy region (rho = -0.04 to -0.16). Weak dose-related decreases in Ktrans and ve within the GTV and high dose region at day 20 most likely reflect underlying vascular responses to radiation. Our study also provides a voxel-wise analysis schema for future MR biomarker studies with the goal of elucidating surrogates for radionecrosis.",Excluded
1761,"Utility whole body PET/CT scan in malignant melanoma. Can the location of the primary tumor guide image planning?. Aim/Introduction: To determine the value of systematically performing whole-body (head-to-toe) PET/CT images (WBPET) in the evaluation of patients with malignant melanoma and propose a criteria of when standard imaging can be performed. Material(s) and Method(s): Retrospective study of all WB-PET scans performed in patients with malignant melanoma in our hospital, either for staging, restaging, recurrence or post-treatment follow-up, between January 2011 and January 2020. We looked for any FDG avid foci in the lower extremities. The findings were considered as true positives if histopathological findings were confirmed, if the lesion was treated as melanoma because of other complementary findings (physical exploration, ultrasound, etc) or if during follow-up it was determined as malignant in nature. We also analyzed if the true positive findings had any change in patients management. Result(s): We analyzed 367 WB-PET studies belonging to 169 patients, 93 male (55%) and 76 female (45%), with a mean age of 56.4 years (range 19-90 years). Of the 367 studies performed 170 (46,3%) where for staging (all at least stage IIIB), and 197 (53,7%) for suspected recurrence or post treatment follow-up. From all the WB-PET scans we observed that 19 (5 %) had positive findings in the lower extremities, 11 (3%) of which were true-positive findings (all with histopathological confirmation), 8 (2%) scans were false positive (5 inflammatory foci demonstrated by clinical follow-up and 3 benign lesions (dermatophibroma, nevus and encondroma). From the 11 true-positive findings, 8 (2%) had the primary lesion in an infra-umbilical location; 1 (0.2%) was an extracutaneous melanoma (paranasal) but the finding could be included on a standard study, and the other 2(0,4%), had disseminated disease so the findings did not change clinical management. Also, none of these findings generated a change in management. Conclusion(s): In our cohort, we found that WB-PET in patients with melanoma had no additional value to standard (head-tomid-thigh) PET/CT images. We propose to perform WB-PET only in patients with the primary melanoma lesion located below the umbilical line. PET/CT acquisition of the lower extremities results in increased scan time and unnecessary radiation dose without generated therapeutic impact.",Excluded
1018,"Significance of Fuchs Flecks in Patients With Pterygium/Pinguecula: Earliest Indicator of Ultraviolet Light Damage. PURPOSE: Fuchs flecks (FFs) have been previously identified at the leading edge of pterygia and may represent collections of epithelial stem-like cells that give rise to this condition. This study aims to evaluate the clinical significance of FFs in patients with ocular surface disorders, such as pterygium and pinguecula, by in vivo confocal microscopy (IVCM)., METHODS: This study is a Single-center, retrospective, observational case series of 40 eyes from 20 patients with clinical diagnoses of pinguecula or pterygium, or both. IVCM (Rostock Cornea Module; Heidelberg Engineering, Heidelberg, Germany) was performed on patients with pinguecula or pterygium, or both. The presence of FFs on the ocular surface of patients with pterygium and pinguecula was assessed by IVCM and subsequently documented., RESULTS: FFs were present in 24 of 30 eyes (80.0%) in paired macroscopically normal nasal or limbal regions, 19 of 20 (95.0%) in pinguecula, 13 of 15 (86.7%) in primary pterygia, and 7 of 7 (100%) in recurrent pterygia., CONCLUSIONS: High rates of FFs were identified at the head of pinguecula, primary pterygium, recurrent pterygium, and macroscopically normal nasal and temporal limbus. We postulate that FFs may represent precursor lesions to UV-associated ocular surface pathology. Identification of Fuchs fleck by IVCM may permit clinicians to predict the patients who may progress to develop more advanced pathology.",Excluded
1555,"Elevated Radiation Exposure Associated With Above Surface Flat Detector Mini C-Arm Use. Background: This study aims to test the hypothesis that: (1) radiation exposure is increased with the intended use of Flat Surface Image Intensifier (FSII) units above the operative surface compared with the traditional below-table configuration; (2) this differential increases in a dose-dependent manner; and (3) radiation exposure varies with body part and proximity to the radiation source. Methods: A surgeon mannequin was seated at a radiolucent hand table, positioned for volar distal radius plating. Thermoluminescent dosimeters measured exposure to the eyes, thyroid, chest, hand, and groin, for 1- and 15-minute trials from a mini C-arm FSII unit positioned above and below the operating surface. Background radiation was measured by control dosimeters placed within the operating theater. Results: At 1-minute of exposure, hand and eye dosages were significantly greater with the flat detector positioned above the table. At 15-minutes of exposure, hand radiation dosage exceeded that of all other anatomic sites with the FSII in both positions. Hand exposure was increased in a dose-dependent manner with the flat detector in either position, whereas groin exposure saw a dose-dependent only with the flat detector beneath the operating table. Conclusions: These findings suggest that the surgeon's hands and eyes may incur greater radiation exposure compared with other body parts, during routine mini C-arm FSII utilization in its intended position above the operating table. The clinical impact of these findings remains unclear, and future long-term radiation safety investigation is warranted. Surgeons should take precautions to protect critical body parts, particularly when using FSII technology above the operating with prolonged exposure time.",Excluded
2041,"Determinants of Sunburn and Sun Protection of Agricultural Workers during Occupational and Recreational Activities. Objective: The aim of this study was to identify determinants of occupational sunburn in agricultural workers and assess their occupational and recreational sun protection habits. Method(s): Specific surveys of agricultural workers in Switzerland and France were conducted (N=1538). Multivariate logistic regressions identified occupational sunburn determinants. Occupational and recreational sun protection habits were estimated and correlated. Result(s): One-year occupational and recreational sunburn prevalences were 19.8% and 11.5%, respectively. Occupational sunburn increased with having a recent recreational sunburn, highly sensitive skin, young age, high perceived skin cancer risk, using sunscreen, and not wearing a hat. Correlation between protection habits during work and leisure was substantial (r s 0.5 to 0.7). Skin health knowledge was high and pro-tanning attitude moderate. Conclusion(s): Potentially modifiable sunburn determinants and suboptimal recreational and occupational sun protection practices were identified in agricultural workers. Refining and tailoring sun protection messages targeting the agricultural sector are needed.© Copyright 2017 American College of Occupational and Environmental Medicine.",Excluded
2777,"The association between depressive and anxiety symptoms and bone mineral density in the general population: The HUNT Study. Background: Psychiatric disorders may be risk factors for reduced bone mineral density (BMD). Longitudinal evidence is limited and this is yet to be examined among community-dwelling adults with anxiety. We aimed to investigate the cross-sectional and longitudinal relationships between anxiety and depressive symptoms and BMD. Method(s): This study examined data from the second Nord-Trondelag Health Study (1995-1997; 1194 men and 7842 women) and a follow-up conducted in 2001 (697 men and 2751 women). Symptomatology was ascertained using the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale and BMD was measured at the forearm using single-energy X-ray absorptiometry. Information on medication use and lifestyle was self-reported, and these, together with anthropometric measures were tested in multivariate analyses. Result(s): In men, adjusted BMD was 2.6% lower at the ultradistal forearm for those with depressive symptoms and 2.6% lower at the ultradistal and 2.0% lower at the distal forearm for those with anxiety symptoms. In women, adjusted BMD at the distal and ultradistal forearm was lower for heavier women with depressive symptoms but this relationship diminished with decreasing weight. Forearm BMD was similar for women with or without anxiety symptoms. Longitudinally, neither depressive nor anxiety symptoms were associated with bone loss over 4.6 years. Limitation(s): Findings cannot be generalised to other skeletal sites and a longer follow-up period may be necessary to detect differences in bone loss. Conclusion(s): These results indicate that depressive and anxiety symptoms are cross-sectionally associated with reduced BMD. These findings provide further evidence to support monitoring BMD in individuals diagnosed with psychiatric illness. © 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",Excluded

Primarily combined radiotherapy and chemotherapy are used to treat unresectable non-small-cell lung cancer; however, the results are not satisfactory. In this study treatment results were retrospectively analyzed and the prognostic factors related to survival were identified. From March 1999 to January 2004, 102 patients with stage IIIA/IIIB non-small-cell lung cancer received definitive radiotherapy with or without chemotherapy. Radiotherapy involved a daily dose of 1.8-2.0 Gy five times a week; 60 Gy was set as the total dose. Maximal chemotherapy was given to patients with normal kidney, liver, and bone marrow functions. The 5-year overall survival rate was 22.2%; the median survival was 18 months. The median follow-up of surviving patients was 53 months. The complete or partial response rate was 85%. At the time of the last follow-up, 21 patients were alive and 81 patients had died, including 5 patients who had died due to radiation pneumonitis. There were significant differences in survival and in the fatal radiation pneumonitis rate between patients with superior lobe lesions and those with middle or inferior lobe lesions.

2844,"Image-guided stereotactic ablative radiotherapy for the liver: a safe and effective treatment. AIMS: Stereotactic ablative body radiotherapy (SABR) is a non-invasive treatment option for inoperable patients or patients with irresectable liver tumors. Outcome and toxicity were evaluated retrospectively in this single-institution patient cohort., PATIENTS AND METHODS: Between 2010 and 2014, 39 lesions were irradiated in 33 consecutive patients (18 male, 15 female, median age of 68 years). All the lesions were liver metastases (n = 34) or primary hepatocellular carcinomas (n = 5). The patients had undergone four-dimensional respiration-correlated PET-CT for treatment simulation to capture tumor motion. We analyzed local control with a focus on CT-based response at three months, one year and two years after treatment, looking at overall survival and the progression pattern., RESULTS: All patients were treated with hypofractionated image-guided stereotactic radiotherapy. The equivalent dose in 2 Gy fractions varied from 62.5 Gy to 150 Gy, delivered in 3-10 fractions (median dose 93.8 Gy, alpha/beta = 10). The CT-based regression pattern three months after radiotherapy revealed partial regression in 72.7% of patients with a complete remission in 27.3% of the cases. The site of first progression was predominantly distant. One- and two-year overall survival rates were 85.4% and 68.8%, respectively. No toxicity of grade 2 or higher according to the NCI Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events v4.0 was observed., CONCLUSION: SABR is a safe and efficient treatment for selected inoperable patients or irresectable tumors of the liver. Future studies should combine SABR with systemic treatment acting in synergy with radiation, such as immunological interventions or hypoxic cell radiosensitizers to prevent distant relapse.

425,"Diagnosing Fish Bone and Chicken Bone Impactions in the Emergency Department Setting: Measuring the System Utility of the Plain Film Screen. OBJECTIVES: In the emergency department, fish and chicken bone impactions are typically evaluated with screening x-rays. We sought to determine whether this modality ultimately improves system outcomes, including length of stay (LOS), cost, and radiation dosage., METHODS: We reviewed patients >= 18 years old presenting to an urban academic emergency department over a 4-year period who received a screening soft-tissue x-ray to determine the presence of a retained fish or chicken bone. We calculated the diagnostic accuracy of x-ray and computed tomography (CT) evaluations, respectively, in addition to system outcomes., RESULTS: Twenty-seven of the 78 patients included for analysis were ultimately positive for bone impaction. Initial x-ray interpretations demonstrated a sensitivity of 24.0% (95% CI, 9.4%-45.1%) and a specificity of 90.0% (95% CI, 78.2%-96.7%). However, initial CT interpretation (ie, a preliminary read from on-call residents) demonstrated a sensitivity of 75% (95% CI, 19.4%-99.4%) and a specificity of 100% (95% CI, 59.0%-100%). LOS, cost, and radiation dosage were not significantly different between patients who ultimately had true bone impactions and those who did not (P > .05)., CONCLUSIONS: X-rays are poor screening tools in determining fish or chicken bone impactions with poor diagnostic and system utility. Further studies should be performed to evaluate the role of a low-radiation CT screen. Copyright © The Author(s) 2015.",Excluded
2813,"Biodistribution, radiation dosimetry, and clinical application of a melanin-targeted PET probe,18F-P3BZA, in patients. N-(2-(diethylamino)-ethyl)-18F-5-fluoropicolinamide (18F-P3BZA) is a radiotracer that demonstrates high binding selectivity and affinity in melanoma. The aim of the present study was to estimate the biodistribution and clinical radiation dosimetry of18F-P3BZA in healthy volunteers and perform a preliminary clinical application for PET/CT imaging in melanoma patients. Method(s):18F-P3BZA was produced efficiently with a radiosynthesizer. Six healthy volunteers were injected with18F-P3BZA (211.7 +/- 15.4 MBq) followed by serial whole-body PET/CT scans and blood tests to assess biodistribution, pharmacokinetic, and radiation dosimetry at 10 min, 1 h, 2 h, and 4 h after injection. The vital signs of volunteers were recorded in regular intervals during the imaging sessions. The effective dose for each subject after the medical internal radiation dosimetry schema was calculated with OLINDA/EXM software. For the preliminary clinical application, 5 patients with suspected melanomas underwent18F-P3BZA PET/CT imaging at 10 min and 1 h after injection. All patients also underwent18F-FDG PET/CT scans on the third day to compare the potential diagnostic ability of18F-P3BZA with18F-FDG. Result(s): The radiochem-istry yield of18F-P3BZA labeling was 12.3% +/- 3.9%, and the purity of18F-P3BZA after purification and formulation was higher than 99.5%. The highest uptake of18F-P3BZA was in the liver with an SUVmean of 8.3 +/- 1.0 at 10 min after injection. The resultant whole-body effective dose was 0.0193 mSv/MBq.18F-P3BZA showed high uptake and suggested an ability for specific imaging of melanoma and its metastasis in patients. The average SUVmean of18F-P3BZA and18F-FDG in tumors was 19.7 +/- 5.3 and 10.8 +/- 2.7 at 60 min after injection. Conclusion(s): Our study suggests that18F-P3BZA is safe and compatible for clinical use. The first-in-human clinical application to melanoma showed favorable delineated tumors in patients, demonstrating the potential of18F-P3BZA for diagnostic PET imaging of melanoma.Copyright © 2019 by the Society of Nuclear Medicine and Molecular Imaging.",Excluded
758,"Imaging for low back pain in the urgent care setting: Does an educational intervention for interns change radiologic management?. BACKGROUND: Low back pain (LBP) is among the most common presenting symptoms in a primary care clinic, and up to a quarter of those visits result in imaging. However, imaging for simple lumbago without red flag symptoms has not been shown to provide clinical benefit, and rather increases costs, anxiety, and radiation exposure. As a result, LBP has been a substantial focus in health services research in an effort to reduce waste and expenses, with several guidelines on appropriate image ordering. We sought to determine the patterns of LBP imaging in an academic urgent care setting and assess the impact of an educational intervention on appropriate image ordering practices among internal medicine (IM) residents. METHOD(S): An interactive lecture series (Imaging Wisely"") was developed for the University of Chicago's IM interns for the 2017-2018 academic year. The curriculum aimed to guide evidence-based imaging by introducing the American College of Radiology's (ACR) Appropriateness Criteria through two lectures and interactive, case-based, Radiology-TEACHES assignments between lectures. Previous research found that the program improved knowledge and intention to change imaging practices. The purpose of this study was to assess for behavior change by focusing on rates of radiologic mismanagement of LBP pre- and postintervention. An electronic medical record query was conducted of all urgent care visits with diagnoses related to LBP among interns (n=27) who participated in the Imaging Wisely lectures. Patient encounters were reviewed and coded for diagnosis, red flag symptoms, type of imaging ordered, and appropriateness of imaging ordered. RESULT(S): Atotal of 219 urgent care encounters for LBP were reviewed. Nineteen percent (n=41) of encounters involved a red flag symptom (duration >6 weeks and failed conservative therapy; concern for cancer, infection, cord compression, or fracture; progressive neurologic symptoms; history of lumbar surgery). Among LBP visits, radiologic mismanagement was noted in 10% of cases (n= 22). This mismanagement was equally attributable to over- and under-imaging. Rates of radiologic mismanagement did not change after interns participated in the Imaging Wisely sessions (chi2 p =0.67; 11.3%incorrect imaging pre-intervention vs. 9.5% post-intervention). Controlling for resident and attending fixed effects increased the odds of correct imaging after the intervention but remained statistically insignificant (OR=3.87 [0.77-19.4]). CONCLUSION(S): The Imaging Wisely lecture series did not lead to a statistically or clinically significant decrease in radiologic mismanagement of low back pain in the urgent care setting by the participating interns. Notably, radiologic mismanagement was attributable to equal amounts of under- and over-imaging. This suggests that curricula should not only focus on decreasing excessive image ordering but also reinforce situations in which imaging is indicated.""",Excluded
3651,"Somatic-cell mutations as a possible predictor of cancer risk. The somatic-mutation theory of carcinogenesis has received strong scientific support from results of recent studies on tumor-suppressor genes. We anticipated that people among the high risk for cancer group, either through exposure to various ionizing radiations or by virtue of unique genotypes, would also manifest increased frequencies of somatic mutation. This report presents the results of two somatic-mutation assays--at the erythrocyte glycophorin A (GPA) and lymphocyte T-cell receptor (TCR) genes--in various groups at high risk for cancer development, including atomic-bomb survivors, patients with various cancers, patients administered Thorotrast, and patients with genetic disorders that make them cancer prone. Although neither the GPA-mutation nor the TCR-mutation assay detects gene mutations directly related to carcinogenesis, increased mutation frequencies were detected by both assays in many individuals among the high-risk groups and among cancer patients. We have continued to follow up those individuals who show values of about three times higher than those of the control group. Thus, these assays may prove useful for identifying high-risk cancer groups and for estimating the effects of mutagens. Such information would constitute a valuable data base for epidemiological studies.",Excluded

All patients were diagnosed by pathology or radiography in the Cancer Radiotherapy Center of the Fifth Medical Center of the PLA General Hospital from March 2014 to December 2018, and treated with cyberknife stereotactic radiotherapy. Progression free survival rate (PFS), local control rate (LC), overall survival rate (OS) and adverse reactions were observed at 1, 2 and 3 years. Kaplan-Meier was used for survival analysis, and Cox regression model was used to analyze survival-related factors. Result(s): All 82 patients successfully completed radiation therapy with a median survival time of 20 months, a median PFS of 10 months, an objective response rate of 64.63% (53/82), and a disease control rate of 85.37% (70/82). After treatment, the PFS at 1, 2, and 3 years were 39.0% (32/82), 22.1% (18/82), and 17.1% (14/82), respectively; the LC at 1, 2, and 3 years were 95.1% (78/82), 92.3% (76/82), and 92.3% (76/82), respectively; and the OS at 1, 2, and 3 years were 68.3% (56/82), 48.8% (40/82) and 31.7% (26/82), respectively. Nine patients suffered from radiation-induced liver disease (RILD), and there were no deaths due to RILD. Cox regression analysis showed that alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) was an independent risk factor for OS (HR=2.304, 95%CI 1.118-4.747;P<0.05).

2261,"Investigation of PKC isoform-specific translocation and targeting of the current of the late afterhyperpolarizing potential of myenteric AH neurons. AH neurons in the enteric nervous system play an essential role in initiating intestinal reflexes and factors that control AH neuron excitability therefore influence the state of the digestive system. Prominent afterhyperpolarizations that follow action potentials in these neurons strongly affect their excitability. In the present work, we have investigated the regulation of the afterhyperpolarizing current (I(AHP)) by protein kinase C (PKC). Electrophysiological responses and protein translocation were investigated in AH neurons of freshly dissected preparations of myenteric ganglia from the guinea-pig ileum. The activator of conventional and novel PKCs, phorbol dibutyrate, but not the activator of novel PKCs, ingenol, blocked the I(AHP). Phorbol dibutyrate had no effect on the hyperpolarization-activated current (I(h)) or on the A current (I(A)). Stimulation of synaptic inputs to the neurons also reduced the I(AHP), and had no effect on I(h) or I(A). Phorbol dibutyrate also reduced a background outward current that was present after the I(AHP) current had been blocked by clotrimazole. Both phorbol dibutyrate and ingenol caused translocation of the novel PKC, PKCepsilon, in these neurons. Only phorbol dibutyrate caused translocation of PKCgamma, a conventional PKC. The studies thus indicate that the activation of PKC by phorbol esters and by nerve stimulation affects AH neurons in a similar way, and that PKC activation targets both the I(AHP) and another background K(+) current. The I(AHP) is targeted by a conventional PKC, suggested to be PKCgamma, as this is the only conventional PKC that is prominent in AH neurons.",Excluded

2666,"Celecoxib and radioresistant glioblastoma-derived CD133+ cells: Improvement in radiotherapeutic effects. Laboratory investigation. Object. Glioblastoma, the most common primary brain tumor, has a poor prognosis, even with aggressive resection and chemoradiotherapy. Recent studies indicate that CD133+ cells play a key role in radioresistance and recurrence of glioblastoma. Cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), which converts arachidonic acid to prostaglandins, is overexpressed in a variety of tumors, including CD133+ glioblastomas. The COX-2-derived prostaglandins promote neovascularization during tumor development, and conventional radiotherapy increases the proportion of CD133+ cells rather than eradicating them. The aim of the present study was to investigate the role of celecoxib, a selective COX-2 inhibitor, in enhancing the therapeutic effects of radiation on CD133+ glioblastomas. Methods. Cells positive for CD133 were isolated from glioblastoma specimens and characterized by flow cytometry, then treated with celecoxib and/or ionizing radiation (IR). Clonogenic assay, cell irradiation, cell cycle analysis, Western blot, and xenotransplantation were used to assess the effects of celecoxib alone, IR alone, and IR with celecoxib on CD133+ and CD133- glioblastoma cells. Three separate xenotransplantation experiments were carried out using 310 severe combined immunodeficient (SCID) mice: 1) an initial tumorigenicity evaluation in which 3 different quantities of untreated CD133- cells or untreated or pretreated CD133+ cells (5 treatment conditions) from 7 different tumors were injected into the striatum of 2 mice (210 mice total); 2) a tumor growth study (50 mice); and 3) a survival study (50 mice). For these last 2 studies the same 5 categories of cells were used as in the tumorigenicity (untreated CD133 - cells, untreated or pretreated CD133+ cells, with pretreatment consisting of celecoxib alone, IR alone, or IR and celecoxib), but only 1 cell source (Case 2) and quantity (5 x 104 cells) were used. Results. High levels of COX-2 protein were detected in the CD133 + but not the CD133- glioblastoma cells. The authors further demonstrated that 30 mM celecoxib was able to effectively enhance the IR effect in inhibiting colony formation and increasing IR-mediated apoptosis in celecoxib-treated CD133+ glioblastoma cells. Furthermore, reduction in radioresistance was correlated with the induction of G2/M arrest, which was partially mediated through the increase in the level of phosphorylated-cdc2. In vivo xenotransplant analysis further confirmed that CD133+-associated tumorigenicity was significantly suppressed by celecoxib treatment. Importantly, pretreatment of CD133+ glioblastoma cells with a combination of celecoxib and IR before injection into the striatum of SCID mice resulted in a statistically significant reduction in tumor growth and a statistically significant increase in the mean survival rate of the mice. Conclusions. Celecoxib combined with radiation plays a critical role in the suppression of growth of CD133+ glioblastoma stemlike cells. Celecoxib is therefore a radiosensitizing drug for clinical application in glioblastoma.",Excluded
3024,"Utility of Computed Tomography following Anterior Cervical Diskectomy and Fusion. Study Design Retrospective case series. Objective To assess the utility of postoperative computed tomography (CT) following anterior cervical diskectomy and fusion (ACDF) and to determine the clinical circumstances most likely to lead to an abnormal CT scan. Methods Patients who underwent ACDF at a tertiary center over a span of 5 years were investigated. Only patients who had a minimum of 6 months' postoperative follow-up and a CT within 2 years after the surgery were included in the study group. All the postoperative notes were reviewed to determine indications for the CT, abnormalities identified, and whether the scan led to an alteration in the treatment course. Results The charts of 690 patients who underwent ACDF were reviewed. Of the 690 patients, 45 (7%) had postoperative CTs. These patients accounted for 53 postoperative CT scans, 45 (85%) of which were taken for patients who expressed persistent postoperative symptoms and/or had abnormal imaging. There were no indications for 8 (15%) of the CTs. Patients who had a CT for persistent symptoms and/or abnormal preliminary imaging were significantly more likely to have an abnormal CT (p = 0.03) and/or an alteration in treatment course (p = 0.04) compared with those with no symptomatic or radiologic indication for CT. Conclusions CT is associated with minimal utility regarding the alteration of treatment course when employed in asymptomatic patients. Postoperative CT should be ordered solely for symptomatic patients or those with other abnormal preliminary imaging. Judicious use of postoperative CT will limit the radiation exposure and cost.Copyright © 2015 Georg Thieme Verlag KG Stuttgart New York.",Excluded
3571,"High-frequency jet ventilation under general anesthesia facilitates CT-guided lung tumor thermal ablation compared with normal respiration under conscious analgesic sedation. PURPOSE: To determine whether technical difficulty of computed tomography (CT)-guided percutaneous lung tumor thermal ablations is altered with the use of high-frequency jet ventilation (HFJV) under general anesthesia (GA) compared with procedures performed with normal respiration (NR) under conscious sedation (CS)., MATERIALS AND METHODS: Thermal ablation treatment sessions performed with NR under CS or HFJV under GA with available anesthesia records and CT fluoroscopic images were retrospectively reviewed; 13 and 33 treatment sessions, respectively, were identified. One anesthesiologist determined the choice of anesthesiologic technique independently. Surrogate measures of procedure technical difficulty--time duration, number of CT fluoroscopic acquisitions, and radiation dose required for applicator placement for each tumor--were compared between anesthesiologic techniques. The anesthesiologist time and complications were also compared. Parametric and nonparametric data were compared by Student independent-samples t test and chi(2) test, respectively., RESULTS: Patients treated with HFJV under GA had higher American Society of Anesthesiologists classifications (mean, 2.66 vs 2.23; P = .009) and smaller lung tumors (16.09 mm vs 27.38 mm; P = .001). The time duration (220.30 s vs 393.94 s; P = .008), number of CT fluoroscopic acquisitions (10.31 vs 19.13; P = .023), and radiation dose (60.22 mGy.cm vs 127.68 mGy.cm; P = .012) required for applicator placement were significantly lower in treatment sessions performed with HFJV under GA. There was no significant differences in anesthesiologist time (P = .20), rate of pneumothorax (P = .62), or number of pneumothoraces requiring active treatment (P = .19)., CONCLUSIONS: HFJV under GA appears to reduce technical difficulty of CT-guided percutaneous applicator placement for lung tumor thermal ablations, with similar complication rates compared with treatment sessions performed with NR under CS. The technique is safe and may facilitate treatment of technically challenging tumors. Copyright © 2014 SIR. Published by Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.",Excluded
1159,"Trends in the incidence of sudden deaths and heart diseases in fukushima after the great east Japan earthquake. On March 11, 2011, a great earthquake, known as the Great East Japan Earthquake, hit northeastern Japan, resulting in a tsunami that caused a nuclear disaster, the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant accident, forcing about 160,000 people to evacuate. We, therefore, sought to examine the effects of this evacuation on the onset of cardiovascular diseases and sudden death (SD) in Fukushima Prefecture, three years after the earthquake. We divided the evacuation zone into two areas, whole evacuation zone (Area 1) and partial evacuation zone (Area 2), and we defined the north district of the prefecture as the control area (Area 3). We cross-referenced the death certificate data with data from the Fukushima Prefecture acute myocardial infarction registration survey. For each area, we tallied the number of people who fell into the SD, myocardial infarction (MI), and MI suspected groups. We calculated the age-adjusted incidence rates and analyzed the differences in the adjusted incidence rates across three years using a Poisson regression model. The age-adjusted death rate of the SD group was significantly higher in 2011 in all areas than in 2012 or 2013 (P < 0.05). The total death rate was higher in Area 1 in March 2011, just after the disaster, than in the other two areas. The rate of SD was also higher in Area 1 than in the other areas in March 2011. The incidence of sudden cardiac death might have increased just after the Great East Japan Earthquake in the evacuation area, but not in other areas in Fukushima Prefecture.Copyright © 2019, International Heart Journal Association.

1236,"Synthesis of D-mannose capped silicon nanoparticles and their interactions with MCF-7 human breast cancerous cells. Silicon nanoparticles (SiNPs) hold prominent interest in various aspects of biomedical applications. For this purpose, surface functionalization of the NPs is essential to stabilize them, target them to specific disease area, and allow them to selectively bind to the cells or the bio-molecules present on the surface of the cells. However, no such functionalization has been explored with Si nanoparticles. Carbohydrates play a critical role in cell recognition. Here, we report the first synthesis of silicon nanoparticles functionalized with carbohydrates. In this study, stable and brightly luminescent d-Mannose (Man) capped SiNPs have been synthesized from amine terminated SiNPs and d-mannopyranoside acid. The surface functionalization is confirmed by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (NMR), and energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) studies. The mean diameter of the crystal core is 5.5 nm, as measured by transmission electron microscopy (TEM), while the hydrodynamic diameter obtained by dynamic light scattering (DLS) is 16 nm. The quantum yield (QY) of photoluminescence emission is found to be 11.5%, and the nanoparticles exhibit an exceptional stability over two weeks. The Man-capped SiNPs may prove to be valuable tools for further investigating glycobiological, biomedical, and material science fields. Experiments are carried out using Concanavalin A (ConA) as a target protein in order to prove the hypothesis. When Man functionalized SiNPs are treated with ConA, cross-linked aggregates are formed, as shown in TEM images as well as monitored by photoluminescence spectroscopy (PL). Man functionalized SiNPs can target cancerous cells.

A retrospective review of 45 patients with Stage III and IV malignant tumors of the major salivary glands was undertaken to determine tumor control and patient survival after treatment with surgery and conventional ionizing-radiation therapy. Eight of the 23 patients received early postoperative radiotherapy after initial surgical resection, with a local control rate of 75%. Twelve of 23 patients had surgery as definitive treatment and the tumor recurred locally in all; seven of these 12 patients were subsequently salvaged by further surgery plus postoperative radiotherapy or by radiotherapy alone, with 58% ultimate local control. The remaining three patients had unresectable tumors at diagnosis and received radiation alone, with a local tumor control rate of 33%. Patients were also analyzed according to the extent of surgical resection prior to radiation therapy and according to radiation dose. Eighty-eight percent of completely resected, 50% of partially resected, and 44% of unresected tumors were locally controlled for an overall local control rate of 61%. The 5-year survival rate was significantly higher for patients with local tumor control than for patients who failed locally (31% vs. 0%).",Excluded

The adoption of a six-fraction regime of radiotherapy for patients with locally advanced carcinoma of the bronchus was followed by the appearance of radiation myelitis in eight cases. These were among a group of 130 patients given radiotherapy with anterior and posterior treatment fields, without shielding of the spinal cord. Radiation myelitis was found only in those where the calculated spinal-cord dose exceeded 3350 cGy (rad). The possible precipitating factors in the eight patients who suffered myelopathy were compared with those in the remaining 62 patients who also received spinal-cord doses calculated to be greater than 3350 cGy (rad). Only one difference was found--the haemoglobin concentration was significantly higher in those who suffered neuropathy compared with those who did not (P = 0.05).",Excluded
1031,"Surgeons' exposure to radiation in single- and multi- level minimally invasive transforaminal lumbar interbody fusion; a prospective study. Although minimally invasive transforaminal lumbar interbody fusion (MIS-TLIF) has widely been developed in patients with lumbar diseases, surgeons risk exposure to fluoroscopic radiation. However, to date, there is no studies quantifying the effective dose during MIS-TLIF procedure, and the radiation dose distribution is still unclear. In this study, the surgeons' radiation doses at 5 places on the bodies were measured and the effective doses were assessed during 31 consecutive 1- to 3-level MIS-TLIF surgeries. The operating surgeon, assisting surgeon, and radiological technologist wore thermoluminescent dosimeter on the unshielded thyroid, chest, genitals, right middle finger, and on the chest beneath a lead apron. The doses at the lens and the effective doses were also calculated. Mean fluoroscopy times were 38.7, 53.1, and 58.5 seconds for 1, 2, or 3 fusion levels, respectively. The operating surgeon's mean exposures at the lens, thyroid, chest, genitals, finger, and the chest beneath the shield, respectively, were 0.07, 0.07, 0.09, 0.14, 0.32, and 0.05 mSv in 1-level MIS-TLIF; 0.07, 0.08, 0.09, 0.18, 0.34, and 0.05 mSv in 2-level; 0.08, 0.09, 0.14, 0.15, 0.36, and 0.06 mSv in 3-level; and 0.07, 0.08, 0.10, 0.15, 0.33, and 0.05 mSv in all cases. Mean dose at the operating surgeon's right finger was significantly higher than other measurements parts (P,0.001). The operating surgeon's effective doses (0.06, 0.06, and 0.07 mSv for 1, 2, and 3 fusion levels) were low, and didn't differ significantly from those of the assisting surgeon or radiological technologist. Revision MIS-TLIF was not associated with higher surgeons' radiation doses compared to primary MIS-TLIF. There were significantly higher surgeons' radiation doses in over-weight than in normal-weight patients. The surgeons' radiation exposure during MIS-TLIF was within the safe level by the International Commission on Radiological Protection's guidelines. The accumulated radiation exposure, especially to surgeon's hands, should be carefully monitored. © 2014 Funao et al.",Excluded
1405,"UK national cohort of anal cancer treated with intensity-modulated radiotherapy: One-year oncological and patient-reported outcomes. BACKGROUND: Concurrent chemoradiotherapy is the standard treatment for anal cancer. Following national UK implementation of intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT), this prospective, national cohort evaluates the one-year oncological outcomes and patient-reported toxicity outcomes (PRO) after treatment., MATERIALS AND METHODS: A national cohort of UK cancer centers implementing IMRT was carried out between February to July 2015. Cancer centers provided data on oncological outcomes, including survival, and disease and colostomy status at one-year. EORTC-QLQ core (C30) and colorectal (CR29) questionnaires were completed at baseline and one-year followup. The PRO scores at baseline and one year were compared., RESULTS: 40 UK Cancer Centers returned data with a total of 187 patients included in the analysis. 92% received mitomycin with 5-fluorouracil or capecitabine. One-year overall survival was 94%; 84% were disease-free and 86% colostomy-free at one-year followup. At one year, PRO results found significant improvements in buttock pain, blood and mucus in stools, pain, constipation, appetite loss, and health anxiety compared to baseline. No significant deteriorations were reported in diarrhea, bowel frequency, and flatulence. Urinary symptom scores were low at one year. Moderate impotence symptoms at baseline remained at one year, and a moderate deterioration in dyspareunia reported., CONCLUSIONS: With national anal cancer IMRT implementation, at this early pre-defined time point, one-year oncological outcomes were reassuring and resulted in good disease-related symptom control. one-year symptomatic complications following CRT for anal cancer using IMRT techniques appear to be relatively mild. These PRO results provide a basis to benchmark future studies. Copyright © 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",Excluded
3304,"Dose-escalation with CHARTWEL (continuous hyperfractionated accelerated radiotherapy week-end less) combined with neo-adjuvant chemotherapy in the treatment of locally advanced non-small cell lung cancer. PURPOSE: a radiation-dose-escalation study was undertaken to assess the therapeutic benefit of combining accelerated hyperfractionated radiotherapy (RT) with neo-adjuvant chemotherapy (CT) in non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC)., MATERIALS AND METHODS: One hundred and thirteen patients with locally advanced NSCLC were entered into a phase II trial of CHARTWEL (CHART Week-End-Less) 54 Gy or 60 Gy with or without three cycles of CT. Acute oesophageal reactions and analgesia were scored for up to 8 weeks after the start of RT. Pneumonitis, lung fibrosis, spinal cord and oesophageal strictures, were assessed using clinical and radiological criteria from 3 months onwards and throughout the study. Haematological and gastrointestinal toxicity was monitored in those patients undergoing CT. Endpoints for treatment outcome were overall survival, disease-free survival and loco-regional control., RESULTS: Chemotherapy enhanced the incidence and duration of acute dysphagia,but the increase was transient. Healing occurred in all cases and there has been no evidence of long-term oesophageal complications. Clinically, almost 25% of those receiving CT+RT had Grade 2 pneumonitis, higher than seen with RT alone. However, the 1 patient with severe Grade 3 pneumonitis was in the RT 60 Gy alone group. An incidence of 17% Grade 2 pulmonary fibrosis at 2 years was seen with CT, slightly lower than with RT alone. To date, there is no evidence of Grade 3 lung fibrosis. There was a higher scoring of lung damage with the radiological endpoint, which gave no indication that CT increased pulmonary toxicity over that of RT alone. Loco-regional control at 2 years was 37% and 55% for CHARTWEL 54 Gy and 60 Gy alone compared with 72% in those treated with 60 Gy and neo-adjuvant CT However, this did not translate into a survival advantage., CONCLUSIONS: This study of CHARTWEL combined with induction chemotherapy, has shown that the strategy is feasible and that a possible therapeutic benefit may be obtained by the addition of CT. Although neo-adjuvant treatment increased acute mucosal reactions and slight-to-moderate pneumonitis seen with CHARTWEL 60 Gy, the clinical management and quality of life of these patients is similar to those treated with radiotherapy alone.",Excluded
2693,"The effects of stimulation frequency and fatigue on the force-intensity relationship for human skeletal muscle. OBJECTIVE: Functional electrical stimulation (FES) has not gained widespread application for a number of factors; two of which are rapid muscle fatigue and imprecise control in force. Stimulation intensity is adjusted during FES to overcome the decline in muscle force due to fatigue and precisely control muscle force output. The purpose of this study was to understand the relationship between muscle force output and stimulation intensity and to see how this relationship changes with fatigue., METHODS: Quadriceps femoris muscles of 10 able-bodied adults were tested isometrically. Pre- and post-fatigue muscle force responses to stimulation trains with different intensities and frequencies were recorded and analyzed. In addition, a case study using a subject with spinal cord injury was presented to illustrate the use of the force-intensity relationship to reduce muscle fatigue and improve the control of muscle force during repetitive electrical stimulation., RESULTS: An exponential relationship between muscle force and stimulation intensity was observed; interestingly, the normalized force-intensity relationship did not change with stimulation frequency or fatigue., CONCLUSIONS: The observed consistencies in the force-intensity relationship should assist scientists and clinicians to more accurately predict the forces produced by a muscle with changes in pulse duration during repetitive electrical stimulation., SIGNIFICANCE: The findings of this study provide guidelines for clinicians and researchers to adjust the stimulation intensity to achieve precise control of force repetitively during the application of FES.",Excluded
1845,"Radiation exposure in total ankle replacement. BACKGROUND: Radiation exposure from diagnostic imaging procedures is associated with increased cancer risk. No published data currently exist regarding ionizing radiation exposure in total ankle replacement surgery. This study quantified intraoperative fluoroscopic dose and duration during ankle replacement surgery and examined patient and technical factors affecting the level of exposure., METHODS: Fifty-five patients underwent ankle replacement using STAR, Salto-Talaris, or INBONE total ankles. Intraoperative fluoroscopic dose and duration, patient demographics, implant design, and accompanying additional procedures were documented for each case. The relationship between each relevant variable and radiation dose and time was determined., RESULTS: The mean fluoroscopic dose and duration for all cases were 1.15 +/- 0.84 milliGray per case and 77 +/- 34 seconds per case, respectively. There was a positive correlation between the absorbed radiation dose and the duration of fluoroscopy (r = .50, P < .001). The mean fluoroscopic doses were 1.53 milliGray, 0.99 milliGray, and 0.88 milliGray for INBONE, STAR, and Salto-Talaris prostheses, respectively. Fluoroscopic dose was significantly influenced by implant design (P = .035), with implants using an intramedullary referencing guide associated with higher radiation doses. After excluding cases requiring additional procedures, the fluoroscopic time and radiation dose associated with intramedullary referencing guide implants continued to exceed those of the other implants, but the differences were no longer statistically significant (P = .22, P = .09, respectively)., CONCLUSION: The average patient radiation dose during total ankle replacement was approximately one-fifth the recommended maximum yearly radiation exposure. The radiation dose was positively associated with fluoroscopy duration. Among factors controllable by the surgeon, selection of an implant with an extramedullary alignment system and conscious effort to minimize duration of fluoroscopy can reduce harmful radiation exposure and decrease cancer risk in total ankle replacement patients and associated operating room personnel., LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Level III, comparative series.

Between 2005 and 2013, 22 patients with atypical meningiomas were treated to a median dose of 63 Gy (RBE) using proton therapy, as an adjuvant therapy after surgery (n = 12) or for recurrence or progression of residual tumor (n = 10). Six patients had presumed radiation-induced meningiomas, but none had received prior radiotherapy for their meningioma. The median follow-up time after radiation was 39 months (range 7-104) and all patients remain alive at last follow-up. The 5-year estimate of local control was 71.1 % (95 % CI 49.3-92.9 %). The 5-year estimate of local control was 87.5 % following a radiation dose >60 Gy (RBE), compared to 50.0 % for <=60 Gy (RBE) (p = 0.038). The 5-year estimate of neuraxis dissemination was 5 % (95 % CI 0-14.6 %) and 6.2 % (95 % CI 0-18.2 %) for metastases outside of the central nervous system. Radiation necrosis was observed in one patient with a history of prior cranial irradiation. Fractionated proton therapy was associated with favorable tumor control rates for grade 2 meningiomas.

1104,"Handheld gamma probe used to detect accessory spleens during initial laparoscopic splenectomies. BACKGROUND: Preoperative determination of the accessory spleen still is a major factor in the failure of both laparoscopic and conventional techniques. This study aimed to evaluate the practicability and efficacy of a handheld gamma probe in identifying accessory spleens at the initial intervention., METHODS: This study evaluated 17 patients undergoing laparoscopic splenectomy attributable to benign hematologic disorders. All the patients had preoperative ultrasonography, computed tomography (CT) scan, and nuclear scintigraphic examination of the abdominal cavity to assess the size of the spleen, and to determine the existence of the accessory spleen or spleens. For all the patients, a handheld gamma probe count was used intraoperatively as an adjuvant method to define the presence and location of the accessory splenic tissue. Control nuclear scintigraphic examinations of all the patients were performed 1 month after the surgical procedure., RESULTS: In two cases, intraoperatively accessory splenic tissue was detected by gamma probe, confirming the preoperative CT findings for the patients. One of these patients had three accessory spleens, although preoperative CT scan showed only two of them. However, by the help of the gamma probe, a third spleen located retroperitoneally was defined. For two patients, laparoscopic exploration and handheld gamma probe count did not identify any accessory splenic tissue, although preoperative CT scan indicated accessory spleens. For detecting accessory splenic tissue, the sensitivities of the studied techniques were 0% for ultrasonography, 75% for CT scan, 0% for preoperative nuclear scintigraphy, 75% for laparoscopic exploration, and 100% for perioperative gamma probe examination., CONCLUSION: Preoperative imaging methods for accessory spleen determination still have limited benefits because of their limited sensitivity. Thus, the handheld gamma probe technique may be an adjuvant method for laparoscopic exploration ensuring that no accessory splenic tissue is missed during the initial surgical treatment of benign hematologic disorders.",Excluded

The aim of study was to establish the typical radiation quantity values for the most common trauma orthopaedic surgical procedures and to compare them with reference values of equivalent procedures performed in other institutions. In addition, we assess the impact of image intensifier and flat panel detector technology used for fluoroscopically guidance on patient exposure. Five most frequently performed fluoroscopically guided trauma orthopaedic procedures in University Medical Centre Ljubljana were analysed. Data on 199 cases over a 6 months period from December 2016 to June 2017 were gathered retrospectively. Study covered 40 dynamic hip screw fixations (DHS), 23 proximal femoral nail insertions (PFN), 20 proximal humeral nail insertions (PHN), 77 partial hip endoprosthesis implantations (PEP) and 39 percutaneous posterior spine fixations (PPS). The median and average along with the first and third quartile values of air kerma area product (KAP) for each procedure type were calculated as well as median and average value of fluoroscopy screening time. Typical KAP value for dynamic hip screw fixation was set at 0.52 Gycm2; for proximal femoral nail insertion at 0.53 Gycm2 and for proximal humeral nail insertion at 0.26 Gycm2. For implantation of partial endoprosthesis typical KAP value utilizing flat panel technology was set at 0.08 Gycm2 and at 0.21 Gycm2 when the image intensifier technology was used. Typical KAP value for percutaneous posterior spine fixation was set at 1.26 Gycm2, using flat panel technology and at 3.98 Gycm2 using image intensifier technology. Established typical KAP levels of surgical orthopaedic procedures in traumatology will serve as a valuable tool for further radiation exposure optimization.

3675,"Analysis of the seasonal pattern in suicide. BACKGROUND: Suicide has been attributed to social and psychological factors but also to geophysical effects. Of the latter, changes in solar radiation and geomagnetic activities may contribute to the frequency and the seasonal pattern of suicides., METHODS: We studied with a population-based, nationwide analysis all the individuals who committed suicide (n=27,469) in Finland during the period of 1979 to 1999. The daily data on the number of suicides, and the mean and maximum levels of geomagnetic activity were compiled and modelled with Poisson regression using the number of inhabitants in each province as the denominator. Time series analysis of monthly numbers of suicides was carried out using a seasonal-trend decomposition procedure., RESULTS: There was a strong seasonal effect on suicide occurrence (P<0.00001), the risk of suicide being greatest in spring. The seasonal effect was most pronounced when the number of suicides was relatively low. High levels of solar radiation activity were associated with the increased risk of suicide (P=0.00001), but the effect of geomagnetic activity was weak., LIMITATIONS: No individual data on alcohol consumption or mental disorders were available., CONCLUSIONS: Suicide occurrence varies markedly by season and needs attention where prevention is concerned.",Excluded

UNLABELLED: 3'-Deoxy-3'-(18)F-fluorothymidine ((18)F-FLT) is a PET imaging agent that shows promise for studying cellular proliferation in human cancers. FLT is a nucleoside analog that enters cells and is phosphorylated by human thymidine kinase 1, but the 3' substitution prevents further incorporation into DNA. We estimated the radiation dosimetry for this tracer from data gathered in patient studies., METHODS: Time-dependent tissue concentrations of radioactivity were determined from blood samples and PET images of 18 patients after intravenous injection of (18)F-FLT. Radiation-absorbed doses were calculated using the MIRD Committee methods, taking into account variations that were based on the distribution of activities observed in the individual patients. Effective dose equivalent (EDE) was calculated using International Commission on Radiological Protection Publication 60 tissue weighting factors for the standard man and woman., RESULTS: For a single bladder voiding at 6 h after (18)F-FLT injection, the (18)F-FLT EDE (mean +/- SD) was 0.028 +/- 0.012 mSv/MBq (103 +/- 43 mrem/mCi) for a standard male patient and 0.033 +/- 0.012 mSv/MBq (121 +/- 43 mrem/mCi) for a standard female patient. The organ that received the highest dose was the bladder (male, 0.179 mGy/MBq [662 mrad/mCi]; female, 0.174 mGy/MBq [646 mrad/mCi]), followed by the liver (male, 0.045 mGy/MBq [167 mrad/mCi]; female, 0.064 mGy/MBq [238 mrad/mCi]), the kidneys (male, 0.035 mGy/MBq [131 mrad/mCi]; female, 0.042 mGy/MBq [155 mrad/mCi]), and the bone marrow (male, 0.024 mGy/MBq [89 mrad/mCi]; female, 0.033 mGy/MBq [122 mrad/mCi])., CONCLUSION: Organ dose estimates for (18)F-FLT are comparable to those associated with other commonly performed nuclear medicine tests, and the potential radiation risks associated with (18)F-FLT PET imaging are within accepted limits.",Excluded

We evaluated the performance of the ECAT EXACT HR+ 3-D whole-body positron emission tomography (PET) scanner when employed to measure brain function using H2(15)O bolus activation protocols that are completed in single same-day data acquisition sessions. Using vibrotactile and auditory stimuli as independent activation tasks, we studied the scanner performance under different imaging conditions in five healthy volunteers. Cerebral blood flow images were acquired from each volunteer using H2(15)O bolus injections of activity varying from 5-20 mCi. One-session dose-fractionation strategies were analyzed for rCBF, standard activity-concentration, switched, and cold-bolus/switched protocols. Performance characteristics. The scanner dead time grew linearly with injected dose from 10% to 25%. Random events varied from 30% to 50% of the detected events. Random and scattered events were corrected adequately at all doses. Estimated noise-effective-count curves plateau at about 10 mCi. One-session 12-injection bolus PET activation protocols. Using an acquisition protocol that accounts for the scanner performance and the practical aspects of imaging volunteers and neurological patients in a single same-day session, we assessed the correlation between the significance of activation foci and the dose/injection used. The one-session protocol employs 12 bolus injections/subject. We present evidence suggesting that when an rCBF protocol is used, image noise is reduced significantly when the activity injected increases from 5 to 10 mCi. Increasing the dose from 10 to 15 or 20 mCi yielded further but smaller reductions. Our observations also suggest that image noise will be strongly reduced if a 20-mCi dose/injection is used when data are collected using protocols that employ long acquisition times such as a switched or a cold-bolus/switched protocol.",Excluded
1241,"RAD18 mediates resistance to ionizing radiation in human glioma cells. Radioresistance remains a major challenge in the treatment of glioblastoma multiforme (GBM). RAD18 a central regulator of translesion DNA synthesis (TLS), has been shown to play an important role in regulating genomic stability and DNA damage response. In the present study, we investigate the relationship between RAD18 and resistance to ionizing radiation (IR) and examined the expression levels of RAD18 in primary and recurrent GBM specimens. Our results showed that RAD18 is an important mediator of the IR-induced resistance in GBM. The expression level of RAD18 in glioma cells correlates with their resistance to IR. Ectopic expression of RAD18 in RAD18-low A172 glioma cells confers significant resistance to IR treatment. Conversely, depletion of endogenous RAD18 in RAD18-high glioma cells sensitized these cells to IR treatment. Moreover, RAD18 overexpression confers resistance to IR-mediated apoptosis in RAD18-low A172 glioma cells, whereas cells deficient in RAD18 exhibit increased apoptosis induced by IR. Furthermore, knockdown of RAD18 in RAD18-high glioma cells disrupts HR-mediated repair, resulting in increased accumulation of DSB. In addition, clinical data indicated that RAD18 was significantly higher in recurrent GBM samples that were exposed to IR compared with the corresponding primary GBM samples. Collectively, our findings reveal that RAD18 may serve as a key mediator of the IR response and may function as a potential target for circumventing IR resistance in human GBM.

327,"Telomere stability correlates with longevity of human beings exposed to ionizing radiations. Normal somatic cells have a finite number of divisions, a limited capacity to proliferate. Human telomeres contain TTAGGG repeats which are considered a molecular clock marker. The gradual and progressive telomere shortening at each replicative cycle is associated, through the activation of pRB and p53 pathways and genomic instability, to the replicative senescence, a non-dividing state and widespread cell death. There is no information available about telomere status in individuals who live long and have been exposed to ionizing radiations (IR). To determine the telomere stability, we examined telomeres at metaphase, G2-type chromosome aberrations after IR treatment and karyotypic analysis of 15 individuals. Three individuals were above the age of 80 years and 1 among the 3 was estimated to have received more than 10 Gy of occupational exposure about 30 years back. The other 12 were cancer patients that had received more than 50 Gy of gamma-radiation for therapeutic purposes. No telomere instability or defective G2 chromosome repair was found in 3 individuals above the age of 80 years. Whereas, 3 out of 7 prostate and 1 out of 5 breast cancer patients showed higher G2-type chromosome damage as well as a high frequency of telomeric association (also known as chromosome end associations) along with frequent loss of telomeres. Present studies demonstrate that telomere stability along with normal G2 chromosome repair correlates with the longevity of human beings, whereas defective G2 chromosome repair and telomere instability correlate with the radiotherapy related late toxicity.",Excluded
145,"Postoperative clinical radiosensitivity in patients with Fanconi anemia and head and neck squamous cell carcinoma. Objective: To describe the complications and adverse effects of postoperative radiotherapy in patients with Fanconi anemia (FA). Design(s): Cohort study. Setting(s): Patients with FA treated at community and tertiary care hospitals throughout the United States. Patient(s): The study included patients with FA whowere enrolled in the International FA Registry (IFAR) and who developed head and neck squamous cell carcinoma and received postoperative radiotherapy. Main Outcome Measure(s): Demographics of patients with FA and adverse effects and dosages of radiotherapy. Result(s): Twelve patients with FA (7 men and 5 women) were identified. They developed cancers at a mean age of 35.5 years (age range, 20-48 years). The sites of primary cancer were the oral cavity (n=8), larynx (n=2), pharynx (n=1), and unknown (n=1). The median radiation dose was 5590 cGy (range, 2500-7020 cGy). The most common adverse effects were mucositis (n=9), dysphagia (n=8), and pancytopenia (n=6). Other complications included esophageal stenosis, laryngeal edema, and wound breakdown. Radiotherapy could not be completed in 5 cases. Overall, 8 patients died, 4 during the course of radiotherapy. The postoperative disease-free survival time ranged from 0 to 55 months. Conclusion(s): Patients with FA have a high rate of complications from radiotherapy. Common adverse effects, particularly mucositis, are especially prevalent and difficult to manage in this population. Pancytopenia is common and may lead to further complications, particularly bleeding and infection. Overall survival is poor.

Objectives: Although the effectiveness of gamma knife radiosurgery (GKRS) in controlling the size of pituitary adenomas has been well demonstrated in many studies, the time period in which significant changes in tumor size occurs has been investigated in a limited fashion. It is important to determine the therapeutic window of GKRS in treating pituitary adenomas, i.e., the effective timeframe during which significant size reduction of these tumors occurs, so that alternative treatments such as further GKRS or microsurgery might be prescribed in a timely manner if clinically indicated. Method(s): This was a nested sample of an ongoing local cohort study on GKRS for pituitary adenomas at the University of Virginia. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) using dedicated sequences was employed. Only patients with a baseline MRI (TP0) and at least 1 follow-up study performed in the University Hospital after GKRS were included. The follow-up scans were performed at five time-points (TP1-TP5) which were 6, 12, 24, 36 and 48 months after GKRS. The dimensional indices of the tumors were measured in three orthogonal planes, i.e., transverse (TR), antero-posterior (AP) and cranio-caudal (CC). The volumes of the tumors were estimated by using the following formula: $${\text{V}} = \pi\,({\text{TR}} \times {\text{AP}} \times {\text{CC}})/6$$V=pi(TRxAPxCC)/6. Tumor volume decrease by more than 25 % from baseline was considered as 'shrinkage', <25 % tumor size increase or decrease was considered 'static', and more than 25 % increase as 'increment'. Our cohort consisted of 21 patients, with functioning adenomas in 13 subjects i.e. six adrenocorticotrophic hormone (ACTH)-secreting and seven growth hormone (GH)-secreting, and non-functioning (NF) adenomas in eight subjects. Result(s): In 26 adenomas (8 ACTH, 9 GH and 9 NF), tumor control (tumor shrinkage or static) were achieved in 21 tumors (80.8 %); 89, 75, and 78 % for GH-secreting, ACTH-secreting and NF adenomas respectively, at the end of the 4-year follow-up period. Analysis of variance showed significant differences of GKRS margin dose among different types of tumors (p = 0.013), but not of baseline tumor volumes (p = 0.240). Logistic regression analysis showed no significant association of margin dose, baseline volume or tumor type with the tumor control outcome. Comparison of tumor change using dimensional indices relative to the base time point (TP0) showed that in the sample there was an average reduction of 1.290 mm at TP1 (6 months) with p values 0.155 (parametric t test) and 0.098 (non-parametric Wilcoxon signed-ranked test) respectively, showing a moderate reduction in tumor dimensional indices. The change in dimensional indices at later time points (TP2-TP5) showed an average reduction ranging from 1.930 to 2.471 mm. Significant reduction in the mean dimensional indices was firstly observed at TP2 (1 year) with p values 0.013 (t test) and 0.018 (Wilcoxon signed-rank test). Such scale of reduction in the dimensional indices appeared to be maintained along the time axis (from TP2 to TP5). Conclusion(s): Significant decrease in tumor dimensional indices tended to occur at 1 year post-GKRS. Although to a lesser extent, such decrease in dimensional indices continued up to the end of our follow-up period.Copyright © 2014, Springer Science+Business Media New York.",Excluded

Objectives To evaluate the levels of S100A4 in serum of patients with recent-onset RA and to characterize the association of S100A4 with disease activity and response to treatment. Methods Serum levels of S100A4 protein were measured by ELISA in 59 patients with recent-onset RA (symptom duration <6 months) before and 3 months after initiation of treatment with disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs, and cross-sectionally in 42 healthy controls. IgM rheumatoid factor (IgM-RF), anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide antibodies (ACPA) and C-reactive protein (CRP) were analysed at baseline. Clinical disease activity (DAS28) was assessed at baseline and at 3, 6 and 12 months after initiation of treatment. The degree of radiographic joint damage was calculated from x-rays using the Sharp-van der Heijde Score (SHS) at baseline and at month 12. Results Mean DAS28 (SD) significantly decreased from 5.36 (1.42) at baseline to 3.09 (1.52) at month 3 (n=59) and to 2.69 (1.19) at month 12 (n=40), respectively (p<0.0001). Of the 40 patients with available radiographs, 9 (23%) showed an increase in SHS (SHS >0) after 12 months. The levels of serum S100A4 protein were significantly higher in patients with recent-onset RA compared to healthy controls (646.60+/-602.60 vs. 46.97+/-30.12 ng/ml; p<0.001) and significantly decreased after 3 months of treatment (to 388.10+/-521.00; p<0.001). There was positive correlation of baseline levels of S100A4 with IgM-RF (r=0.611; p<0.0001) and ACPA levels (r=0.471; p<0.001). After adjustment for IgM-RF, the levels of S100A4 at baseline (r=0.403; p<0.05) as well as at month 3 (r=0.548; p<0.01) were positively correlated with DAS28 after 12 months of treatment in female patients (n=28). There was no correlation in male patients. The levels of S100A4 did not correlate with disease activity at baseline or with the change of disease activity over time. Furthermore, there was no association between baseline levels or changes of SA100A4 and achievement of DAS28 remission or radiographic progression. Conclusions Our results indicate that circulating S100A4 levels are significantly higher in patients with recent-onset RA compared to healthy individuals and that higher S100A4 levels at baseline or at month 3 might have predictive potential for worse treatment response at month 12, at least in female patients with recent-onset RA.",Excluded
1784,"Peritumoral inflammatory reaction in non-melanoma skin cancers - histological and immunohistochemical study. Non-melanoma skin cancers (NMSCs) are the most frequent types of cancer in white skin populations, all over the world. In the last 40 years, there was observed a rapid increase of their incidence, because of the UV radiations exposure and weather changes. Although its morbidity is a relatively modest one, the direct social costs of NMSCs are quite substantial due to a high incidence. Due to these reasons, numerous studies try to clarify the etiopathogenic mechanisms of NMSCs, to elaborate treatment and prevention measures. In the last years, a special attention was given to the relation between inflammation and skin cancer. In our study, we performed a histological and immunohistological evaluation of the inflammatory reaction on a number of 73 surgical exeresis pieces coming from the patients diagnosed with NMSCs. Of these, 21 were squamous cell carcinomas (SCCs) and 52 basal cell carcinomas (BCCs). The peritumoral inflammatory reaction in NMSCs was an extremely variable one in intensity and distribution, from one case to another and even from one area to another within the same tumor, thus proving the complexity of the relations between tumor cells and the cells of the immune system. By comparing the intensity of the inflammatory reaction between the two main types of NMSCs, there was observed that in SCCs the inflammatory reaction was more intense in comparison to BCCs. Also, in SCC there was highlighted a more abundant inflammatory infiltrate in poorly differentiated carcinomas, in comparison to the well-differentiated ones. The presence of the immune system cells (T-lymphocytes, macrophages, mast cells) among the tumoral cells, in a direct contact with these, makes us believe that between the two categories of cells there may appear mechanisms of intercellular communication, distinct from the mechanisms of paracrine signaling.",Excluded
305,"Cognitive impairment following radiation to hippocampus and other brain structures in adults with primary brain tumours. Background: Radiation therapy (RT) to the brain may result in cognitive impairment. The primary objective of the present study was to examine the relationship between RT dose to the hippocampus and learning and memory functions. Secondary objective was to examine relationships between doses to other brain structures and specific cognitive functions. Method(s): A cross-sectional analysis was undertaken in 78 primary brain tumour patients after RT. Cognitive function was assessed by neuropsychological tests. Test scores were standardized using normative data adjusted for age and level of education. Test-specific cognitive impairment was determined as a z-score <=-1.5. Radiation dose to brain structures and test-specific cognitive impairment outcomes were fitted to a logistic regression model. Result(s): High RT dose to the left hippocampus was associated with impaired verbal learning and memory (p = 0.04). RT dose to the left hippocampus, left temporal lobe, left frontal lobe and total frontal lobe were associated with verbal fluency impairment (p < 0.05) and doses to the thalamus and the left frontal lobe with impaired executive functioning (p <= 0.03). Finally, RT dose to the brain and thalamus were associated with impaired processing speed (p <= 0.05). Conclusion(s): The present study indicates that the hippocampus may be vulnerable to radiation and that high radiation doses to the left hippocampus may lead to significant verbal learning and memory impairment. High RT doses to the left hippocampus and other left side structures may result in impairments in verbal fluency, executive function, and processing speed. Validation of these findings are being undertaken in a prospective study.Copyright © 2020 Elsevier B.V.",Excluded
3322,"Risk of oxidative damage and bone resorption from increased iron stores during space flight. An increased amount of stored iron from neocytolysis of red blood cells and a high dietary intake of iron during space flight have raised concern about the risk of excess iron causing oxidative damage, particularly in bone. To investigate this risk, biomarkers of iron status, oxidative damage, and bone resorption during space flight were analyzed for 23 (16 M/7 F) International Space Station crewmembers. As many as 5 in-flight blood samples and 24-h urine pools were collected from each crewmember. Serum iron increased slightly during space flight and decreased at landing (P < 0.0004). An increase in serum ferritin early in flight (217% in women and 68% in men, P < 0.0004), returning to preflight concentrations at landing, and a decrease in transferrin and transferrin receptors during flight indicated that a transient increase in iron stores occurred. No inflammatory response was observed during flight. The oxidative damage markers 8-hydroxy-2'- deoxyguanosine and prostaglandin F2alpha were positively correlated (both P < 0.001) with serum ferritin. A greater area under the curve for ferritin during flight was correlated with greater changes in bone mineral density of several bone regions after flight. The results suggest that increased iron stores do constitute a risk factor for oxidative damage and bone resorption, during space flight and on Earth.",Excluded
63,"Carbon ion radiotherapy for patients with hepatocellular carcinoma in the caudate lobe carbon ion radiotherapy for hepatocellular carcinoma in caudate lobe. Aim: The treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma in the caudate lobe (HCCCL) is technically challenging. We aimed to investigate the efficacy and toxicity of carbon ion radiotherapy (C-ion RT) for HCCCL. Method(s): Patients with HCCCL treated with C-ion RT at our hospital between January 2011 and December 2018 were evaluated. The total dose was 52.8 or 60 Gy (relative biological effectiveness) in four or 12 fractions depending on the distance between the tumor and the gastrointestinal tract. The survival outcome, the presence or absence of recurrence (local recurrence, intrahepatic recurrence outside the irradiation field, or extrahepatic recurrence), and acute/late adverse events were evaluated. Result(s): Nine patients were included. The median tumor size was 3.4 cm, and the median follow-up duration was 18.3 months for all patients. No patient developed local recurrence during follow-up. Five patients subsequently developed intrahepatic recurrence outside the irradiation field and two had extrahepatic metastasis. Five patients died of hepatocellular carcinoma. No acute adverse events of grade >=2 were observed. Two patients experienced grade 2 or 3 late adverse events, including obstructive jaundice, hepatic encephalopathy, ascites, and edema. Conclusion(s): Carbon ion radiotherapy for HCCCL achieved excellent local control with acceptable adverse events and can thus be a curative treatment option for HCCCL.Copyright © 2020 The Japan Society of Hepatology",Excluded
2730,"Evaluation of rodent spaceflight in the NASA animal enclosure module for an extended operational period (Up to 35 days). The National Aeronautics and Space Administration Animal Enclosure Module (AEM) was developed as a self-contained rodent habitat for shuttle flight missions that provides inhabitants with living space, food, water, ventilation, and lighting, and this study reports whether, after minimal hardware modification, the AEM could support an extended term up to 35 days for Sprague-Dawley rats and C57BL/6 female mice for use on the International Space Station. Success was evaluated based on comparison of AEM housed animals to that of vivarium housed and to normal biological ranges through various measures of animal health and well-being, including animal health evaluations, animal growth and body masses, organ masses, rodent food bar consumption, water consumption, and analysis of blood contents. The results of this study confirmed that the AEMs could support 12 adult female C57BL/6 mice for up to 35 days with self-contained RFB and water, and the AEMs could also support 5 adult male Sprague-Dawley rats for 35 days with external replenishment of diet and water. This study has demonstrated the capability and flexibility of the AEM to operate for up to 35 days with minor hardware modification. Therefore, with modifications, it is possible to utilize this hardware on the International Space Station or other operational platforms to extend the space life science research use of mice and rats. 2016 Macmillan Publishers Limited.",Excluded
3278,"The effect of anatomical modeling on space radiation dose estimates: A comparison of doses for NASA phantoms and the 5th, 50th, and 95th percentile male and female astronauts. The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) performs organ dosimetry and risk assessment for astronauts using model-normalized measurements of the radiation fields encountered in space. To determine the radiation fields in an organ or tissue of interest, particle transport calculations are performed using self-shielding distributions generated with the computer program CAMERA to represent the human body. CAMERA mathematically traces linear rays (or path lengths) through the computerized anatomical man (CAM) phantom, a computational stylized model developed in the early 1970s with organ and body profiles modeled using solid shapes and scaled to represent the body morphometry of the 1950 50th percentile (PCTL) Air Force male. With the increasing use of voxel phantoms in medical and health physics, a conversion from a mathematical-based to a voxel-based ray-tracing algorithm is warranted. In this study, the voxel-based ray tracer (VoBRaT) is introduced to ray trace voxel phantoms using a modified version of the algorithm first proposed by Siddon (1985 Med. Phys. 12 252-5). After validation, VoBRAT is used to evaluate variations in body self-shielding distributions for NASA phantoms and six University of Florida (UF) hybrid phantoms, scaled to represent the 5th, 50th, and 95th PCTL male and female astronaut body morphometries, which have changed considerably since the inception of CAM. These body self-shielding distributions are used to generate organ dose equivalents and effective doses for five commonly evaluated space radiation environments. It is found that dosimetric differences among the phantoms are greatest for soft radiation spectra and light vehicular shielding. 2011 Institute of Physics and Engineering in Medicine.",Excluded
3094,"Dose conversion coefficients for neutron external exposures with five postures: walking, sitting, bending, kneeling, and squatting. In a previous study, posture-dependent dose coefficients (DCs) for photon external exposures were calculated using the adult male and female mesh-type reference computational phantoms (MRCPs) of the International Commission on Radiological Protection (ICRP) that had been transformed into five non-standing postures (i.e. walking, sitting, bending, kneeling, and squatting). As an extension, the present study was conducted to establish another DC dataset for external exposures to neutrons by performing Monte Carlo radiation transport simulations with the adult male and female MRCPs in the five non-standing postures. The resulting dataset included the DCs for absorbed doses (i.e., organ/tissue-averaged absorbed doses) delivered to 29 individual organs/tissues, and for effective doses for neutron energies ranging from 10-9 to 104 MeV in six irradiation geometries: antero-posterior (AP), posteroanterior (PA), left-lateral (LLAT), right-lateral (RLAT), rotational (ROT), and isotropic (ISO) geometries. The comparison of DCs for the non-standing MRCPs with those of the standing MRCPs showed significant differences. In the lateral irradiation geometries, for example, the standing MRCPs overestimate the breast DCs of the squatting MRCPs by up to a factor of 4 due to the different arm positions but underestimate the gonad DCs by up to about 17 times due to the different leg positions. The impact of different postures on effective doses was generally less than that on organ doses but still significant; for example, the standing MRCPs overestimate the effective doses of the bending MRCPs only by 20% in the AP geometry at neutron energies less than 50 MeV, but underestimate those of the kneeling MRCPs by up to 40% in the lateral geometries at energies less than 0.1 MeV.",Excluded

The aim of this study was to investigate to what extent changes in speech after C-IMRT treatment are related to mean doses to the tongue and velopharynx (VP). In 34 patients with advanced hypopharyngeal, nasopharyngeal, or oropharyngeal cancer, changes in speech from pretreatment to 10 weeks and 1 year posttreatment were correlated with mean doses to the base of tongue (BOT), oral cavity (OC) and tonsillar fossa/soft palate (VP). Differences in anteroposterior tongue position, dorsoventral degree of tongue to palate or pharynx constriction, grooving, strength, nasality, and laryngeal rise, were assessed by acoustic changes in three speech sounds that depend on a (post-) alveolar closure or narrowing (/t/, /s/, /z/), three with a tongue to palate/pharyngeal narrowing (/l/, /r/, /u/), and in vowel /a/ at comfortable and highest pitch. Acoustically assessed changes in tongue positioning, shape, velopharyngeal constriction, and laryngeal elevation were significantly related to mean doses to the tongue and velopharynx. The mean dose to BOT predicted changes in anteroposterior tongue positioning from pre- to 10-weeks posttreatment. From pretreatment to 1-year, mean doses to BOT, OC, and VP were related to changes in grooving, strength, laryngeal height, nasality, palatalization, and degree of pharyngeal constriction. Changes in speech are related to mean doses to the base of tongue and velopharynx. The outcome indicates that strength, motility, and the balance between agonist and antagonist muscle forces change significantly after radiotherapy.",Excluded
675,"Stereotactic body radiation therapy with concurrent full-dose gemcitabine for locally advanced pancreatic cancer: A pilot trial demonstrating safety. Background: Concurrent chemoradiation is a standard option for locally advanced pancreatic cancer (LAPC). Concurrent conventional radiation with full-dose gemcitabine has significant toxicity. Stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) may provide the opportunity to administer radiation in a shorter time frame with similar efficacy and reduced toxicity. This Pilot study assessed the safety of concurrent full-dose gemcitabine with SBRT for LAPC. Method(s): Patients received gemcitabine, 1000 mg/m2 for 6 cycles. During week 4 of cycle 1, patients received SBRT (25 Gy delivered in five consecutive daily fractions of 5 Gy prescribed to the 75-83% isodose line). Acute and late toxicities were assessed using NIH CTCAE v3. Tumor response was assessed by RECIST. Patients underwent an esophagogastroduodenoscopy at baseline, 2, and 6 months to assess the duodenal mucosa. Quality of life (QoL) data was collected before and after treatment using the QLQ-C30 and QLQ-PAN26 questionnaires. Result(s): Between September 2009 and February 2011, 11 patients enrolled with one withdrawal during radiation therapy. Patients had grade 1 to 2 gastrointestinal toxicity from the start of SBRT to 2 weeks after treatment. There were no grade 3 or greater radiation-related toxicities or delays for cycle 2 of gemcitabine. On endoscopy, there were no grade 2 or higher mucosal toxicities. Two patients had a partial response. The median progression free and overall survival were 6.8 and 12.2 months, respectively. Global QoL did not change between baseline and immediately after radiation treatment. Conclusion(s): SBRT with concurrent full dose gemcitabine is safe when administered to patients with LAPC. There is no delay in administration of radiation or chemotherapy, and radiation is completed with minimal toxicity. © 2013 Gurka et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",Excluded

Purpose: Randomized studies have suggested that sucralfate is effective in mitigating diarrhea during pelvic radiation therapy (RT). This North Central Cancer Treatment Group study was undertaken to confirm the antidiarrheal effect of sucralfate. Several other measures of bowel function were also assessed. Patients and Methods: Patients receiving pelvic RT to a minimum of 45 Gy at 1.7 to 2.1 Gy/d were eligible for the study. Patients were assigned randomly, in double-blind fashion, to receive sucralfate (1.5 g orally every 6 hours) or an identical looking placebo during pelvic RT. Result(s): One hundred twenty-three patients were randomly assigned and found assessable. Overall, there was no significant difference in patient characteristics between those receiving sucralfate and those receiving placebo. Moderate or worse diarrhea was observed in 53% of patients receiving sucralfate versus 41% of those receiving placebo. Compared with patients receiving placebo, more sucralfate-treated patients reported fecal incontinence (16% v 34%, respectively; P = .04) and need for protective clothing (8% v 23%, respectively; P = .04). The incidence and severity of nausea were worse among those taking sucralfate (P = .03). Analysis of patient-reported symptoms 10 to 12 months after RT showed a nonsignificant trend toward more problems in patients taking sucralfate than in those taking placebo (average, 2.3 v 1.9 problems, respectively; P = .34).

METHOD(S): Ninety-three potential liver donors who underwent preoperative contrast-enhanced 64 multidetector CTA and CTC were retrospectively divided into 2 groups: at 80 and at 120 kVp. An institutional review board waiver was obtained. Signal-to-noise ratio and contrast-to-noise ratio of the hepatic artery and common bile duct were obtained. The dose-length product was recorded. Image quality and visibility of hepatic artery and biliary tract anatomy were evaluated. Mann-Whitney U test was used for statistical evaluation. RESULT(S): Mean hepatic artery/common bile duct signal-to-noise ratio was 28.9/28.6 (SD, 14.2/10.0) at 80 kVp and 27.6/25.8 (SD, 8.0/6.2) at 120 kVp (P = 0.61/0.099).

Aims ECVUETM technology, a novel, three-dimensional, non-invasive mapping system, offers a unique arrhythmia characterization and localization. We sought to evaluate the clinical impact of this system in routine clinical mapping and ablation of ventricular arrhythmias (VAs). Methods and results Patients with monomorphic premature ventricular contractions with or without monomorphic ventricular tachycardia were enrolled prospectively and randomized into two groups: ventricular ectopy localization using either 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) algorithms or with ECVUETM, followed by conventional guided ablation. Forty-two patients were enrolled in the study. The ECVUETM system accurately identified both the chamber and sub-localized the VA origin in 20 of 21 (95.2%) patients. In contrast, using 12-lead ECG algorithms, the chamber was accurately diagnosed in 16 of 21 (76.2%) patients, while the arrhythmia origin in only 8 of 21 (38.1%), (P = 0.001 vs. ECVUETM). Acute success in ablation was achieved in all patients. Regarding the number of radiofrequency-energy applications (in total 2 vs. 4, P = 0.005) in the ECVUETM arm, ablation was more precise than the ECG group which used standard of care activation and pace mapping-guided ablation. Three months success in ablation was 95.2% for the ECVUETM and 100% for the ECG group (P = ns). Time to ablation was 35.3 min in the conventional arm and 24.4 min in ECVUE Group, (P = 0.035). The X-ray radiation exposure was 3.21 vs. 0.39 mSv, P = 0.001 for the ECVUETM group and ECG group. Conclusion ECVUETM technology offers a clinically useful tool to map VAs with high accuracy and more targeted ablations superior to the body surface ECG but had significantly higher radiation exposure due to computed tomography scan.Copyright © 2014 Published on behalf of the European Society of Cardiology.

Mammalian DNA topoisomerase II represents the cellular target of many antitumor drugs, such as epipodophyllotoxin VP-16 (etoposide). The mechanism by which VP-16 exerts its cytotoxic and antineoplastic actions has not yet been firmly established, although the unique correlation between sensitivity to ionizing radiation and to topoisomerase II inhibitors suggest the involvement of DNA double-strand breaks. In the present study we analyzed the chromosomal sensitivity of lymphoblastoid cell lines derived from ataxia telangiectasia (AT) patients to low concentrations of the drug. Our results indicate that AT derived cells are hypersensitive to the clastogenic activity of VP-16 either when the drug is present for the whole duration of the cell cycle or specifically in the G2 phase, confirming that the induction of DNA double strand breaks, to which AT cells seem typically sensitive, could have an important role in the biological activity of VP-16.",Excluded

This report includes a description of the automated preparation of 15O-butanol which allows repetitive activation studies, each 15 min apart. Dynamic rCBF studies were extended by prolonged measurements up to 15 min after injection over different organs such as brain, liver, kidneys and bladder.

Based on the pharmacokinetic data in 13 subjects the radiation doses to single organs were calculated according to MIRD pamphlet No. 11 and the effective dose defined by ICRP 60 as an indicator of radiation dose to the total body. The liver received the highest radiation dose of about 2.2 mGy per 1500 MBq of injected 15O-butanol, which is the typical amount of administered tracer in one rCBF measurement. The dose to the kidneys was 1.6 mGy, to the stomach 0.8 mGy, and to the brain 0.16 mGy.

We investigated the feasibility of simultaneous integrated boost (SIB) volumetric modulated arc therapy (VMAT) using elective nodal irradiation (ENI) for middle or lower esophageal cancer and compared it with three-dimensional conformal radiotherapy (3D-CRT). The study included 15 patients. The prescribed doses included a standard dose (50.4 Gy) and a high dose (60 Gy) for the planning target volume (PTV) of the involved lesions. The objective of the whole lung volume receiving >= 20 Gy (V20Gy) was < 30%, and the mean lung dose (MLD) was < 20 Gy. The volumes of the lung receiving 5 Gy (V5Gy) and the heart receiving 30-50 Gy (V30-50Gy) were kept as low as reasonably achievable. As a result, SIB-VMAT showed superior dose conformity for the PTV (p<0.001). Although the lung V5Gy was significantly increased (p<0.001), the V20Gy and MLD showed no significant increase. The heart V30-50Gy showed a > 20% reduction in the mean against 3D-CRTs. Our results demonstrate the feasibility of SIB-VMAT for the treatment of middle or lower esophageal cancer with ENI.

We compared the outcomes of 3- versus 5-fraction stereotactic body radiotherapy regimens for early-stage non-small-cell lung cancer. Analysis was performed on 192 eligible lesions and a propensity score-matched 94 lesion subgroup. There were no statistically significant differences in outcomes between regimens, and both regimens are reasonable treatment options. Purpose(s): To evaluate differences in outcomes of early-stage peripheral non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) treated with either 3- or 5-fraction stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) at 2 institutions. Patients and Methods: Patients diagnosed with peripherally located early-stage NSCLC who received either a median dose of 60 Gy (interquartile range [IQR], 60-60, biologically effective dose, 151-151) in 3 fractions or a median dose of 50 Gy (IQR, 50-50, biologically effective dose, 94-94) in 5 fractions were included in this study. All data were retrospectively collected and reviewed in an institutional review board-approved database. Result(s): A total of 192 lesions in 192 patients were identified: 94 received 3-fraction SBRT and 98 received 5-fraction SBRT. Patients in the 5-fraction cohort had significantly smaller tumors (P =.0021). Larger tumor size was associated with worse overall survival (hazard ratio, 1.40, P =.0013) for all patients. A single grade 3 toxicity was reported in each cohort. A propensity score-matched cohort of 94 patients was constructed with a median follow-up of 29.3 months (IQR, 17.3-44.6) for the 3-fraction cohort and 31.0 months (IQR, 17.0-48.5) for the 5-fraction cohort (P =.84).

None of the upper lung tumor images were of poor quality (74 images in 15 patients), whereas lower lung tumors yielded 14 poor-quality images out of the 50 images (3/10 patients). The difference in image quality between upper and lower lung tumors was statistically significant (p<0.01), especially when accompanied by interstitial lung shadows. Deviations in tumor position in post-MVCT images were analyzed in 110 images from 23 patients and revealed 99 images (90%) with tumor contours confined to PTV. In upper lung tumors, 4/74 images in 15 patients (5.4%) showed tumor contour deviations outside PTV. Lower lung tumors showed a higher rate of deviation with 7/36 images in 8 patients (19.4%) showing tumor contour deviations outside PTV (p<0.05). The maximum deviation was 1 mm for upper lung tumors and 2 mm for lower lung tumors. Conclusion(s): Upper lung tumors are good candidates for MVCT image-guided SBRT-HT. However, lower lung tumors, especially those adjacent to the diaphragm or pleura, can be difficult to assess, warranting precise dose delivery by MVCT image-guided SBRT-HT.",Excluded
1860,"Predictors of the therapeutic effect of corticosteroids on radiation-induced optic neuropathy following nasopharyngeal carcinoma. Radiation-induced optic neuropathy (RION) is a severe visual complication resulting from radiotherapy of the head and neck, which mostly occurs in patients with nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) in the southern part of China. The mechanism of RION is unclear. Therefore, identifying risk factors for RION is an important step towards enhancing our understanding. In the current study, we retrospectively reviewed patients with NPC who were admitted to Sun Yat-Sen Memorial Hospital for visual loss between 2006 and 2017. The study included 38 participants (68 eyes) in the corticosteroid-effective group and 35 participants (64 eyes) in the corticosteroids-ineffective group. We analyzed potential risk factors for RION and developed a prediction model for the therapeutic effect of corticosteroid effect based on a random forests method. The prediction model showed a high accuracy with an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.932 (95% confidence interval = 0.889-0.975). Our results revealed that blood urea nitrogen (BUN) was significantly associated with RION and that RION patients with higher BUN levels responded better to corticosteroid treatment. Altogether, these results suggest that a prediction model, based on clinical factors, could be applied to estimate the therapeutic effect of corticosteroids on RION. Further investigation, however, is needed to confirm the study conclusion.Copyright © 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.",Excluded

3548,"Is treatment of hemorrhagic radiation cystitis with hyperbaric oxygen effective?. Objective: We report our own experience with the use of hyperbaric oxygen (HBO) for the management of postradiation hemorrhagic cystitis. Method(s): We reviewed retrospectively 14 patients from 2001 to 2007 with different pelvic organ malignancies who developed radiation cystitis after irradiation. Patients received 100% oxygen in a hyperbaric chamber at a pressure of 2.5 atmospheres absolute, 60 min bottom time, once a day, 7 days a week for at least 1 month. In principle, 30 HBO treatments per course were performed. After every course of HBO treatments, therapeutic effect was evaluated. The mean duration of follow-up of all patients was 18 months (range: 1-6 years). Result(s): Patients were divided into 2 groups, group 1 (treatment group, n = 10) and group 2 (without treatment, n = 4). The mean duration between the onset of hematuria and the beginning of HBO therapy was 8.9 months (range: 3-34). Group 2 did not receive HBO because they were not healthy enough. Only 2 patients (20%) of group 1 recovered from their hemorrhagic cystitis. Group 1 had a significantly lower cure rate of postirradiation hemorrhagic cystitis in comparison to group 2. Conclusion(s): Our experience with the use of HBO did not yield favorable results. Randomized well-controlled studies are needed. © 2010 S. Karger AG, Basel.",Excluded
1520,"The use of a comprehensive tumour xenograft dataset to validate gene signatures relevant for radiation response. PURPOSE: To investigate the use of xenograft models in a novel gene signature validation method using gene expression microarrays., MATERIALS AND METHODS: Gene expression profiles of ten human Head and Neck squamous cell carcinomas (HNSCCs) were obtained. Several published prognostic gene expression signatures were evaluated within this set. These consisted of different radiotherapy relevant signatures (i.e. for hypoxia, proliferation and 'stemness'). Signatures were correlated with various endpoints that have been determined in the ten different xenograft models. These include immunohistochemical measures for hypoxia and proliferation, volume doubling time (VDT) and local tumour control after fractionated irradiation or after single dose irradiation under clamp hypoxia., RESULTS: We found several significant correlations between the published gene expression signatures and tumour parameters. Several signatures, like the proliferation and wound signature correlated with BrdU labelling index. Further a 'stemness'-related gene signature showed a strong negative correlation with hypoxic fraction., CONCLUSIONS: Simultaneous assessment of immunohistochemistry, in vivo tumour properties and gene expression profiling in a comprehensive set of xenograft models can be used to validate and potentially infer biological information about prognostic gene signatures.",Excluded
253,"The evaluation of a modified technique of Total body irradiation in respect of treatment results and toxicity. Introduction. Total body irradiation (TBI) is a well established part of the conditioning regimen prior to bone marrow transplantation (BMT). Numerous different techniques are used and every center elaborates own solutions. The aim of our study to present the method of TBI developed in our department, and to discuss the results of treatment with respect of early and late toxicity. Material and methods. Between 11.2000 and 08.2004 23 patients were treated with fractionated TBI at the Department od Radiotherapy of the M. Sklodowska-Curie Memorial Cancer Center and Institute of Oncology in Warsawa (MSCMCC). Conditioning chemotherapy and BMT were performed in different hematological departments. All patients were irradiated with a total midline dose of 12 Gy in 6 fractions over 3 consecutive days. Doses to the lung did not exceed 11 Gy. The TBI method used in our department was evaluated over a few years. The following modifications have been introduced to the previously applied technique: change of photon energy from 6 MV to 15 MV; increase of lung dose from 9 Gy to 11 Gy; the use of an individual bolus as a lung compensator in lateral fields; more frequent boost irradiation of the mediastinum and legs with small fields; calculations of Monitor Units based on dosimetric data. Boost irradiation of the chest wall with electrons has been abandoned. Results. Median follow up was 12 months. Up till now, 17/23 patients are alive, of these 16 with no relapse. Immediate toxicity was low. Early complications were observed during the first 6 months after BMT in 11 patients. In the case of 4 patients these complications were fatal. Late complications were observed in 10 patients, including chronic GVHD and hormone disturbancy. Only one patient had developed the first symptoms of cataract. In one case Lhermitte's syndrome was observed. One patient died due to liver insufficiency. Conclusions. The results of treatment and the complications rates in patients treated with TBI at our department are consistent with those published in literature. We conclud that our method of TBI is safe and well tolerated.",Excluded
377,"Thoracic radiotherapy with or without daily low-dose carboplatin in elderly patients with non-small-cell lung cancer: A randomised, controlled, phase 3 trial by the Japan Clinical Oncology Group (JCOG0301). Background: It is unknown whether combined chemoradiotherapy improves overall survival in elderly patients with locally advanced non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). The aim of this study was to assess whether radiotherapy plus carboplatin results in longer survival than radiotherapy alone in elderly patients with NSCLC. Method(s): This was a randomised, controlled, phase 3 trial by the Japan Clinical Oncology Group (JCOG0301). Patients older than 70 years with unresectable stage III NSCLC were randomly assigned to chemoradiotherapy (60 Gy plus concurrent low-dose carboplatin [30 mg/m2 per day, 5 days a week for 20 days]) or radiotherapy alone, using a minimisation method with biased-coin assignment balancing on Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status (0 vs 1 vs 2), stage (IIIA vs IIIB), and institution. The primary endpoint was overall survival, which was analysed for the eligible population and stratified by ECOG performance status, stage, and institution. The trial was stopped early as a result of the second planned interim analysis. This study is registered with UMIN Clinical Trials Registry, number C000000060, and ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00132665. Finding(s): 200 patients were enrolled from Sept 1, 2003 to May 27, 2010: 100 in the chemoradiotherapy group and 100 in the radiotherapy group. The second planned interim analysis was done 10 months after completion of patient accrual. At this time, median follow-up for censored cases was 19.4 months (IQR 10.3-33.5). In accordance with the prespecified stopping rule, the JCOG data and safety monitoring committee recommended early publication of this trial because the difference in overall survival favoured the chemoradiotherapy group. Median overall survival for the chemoradiotherapy and radiotherapy alone groups were 22.4 months (95% CI 16.5-33.6) and 16.9 months (13.4-20.3), respectively (hazard ratio 0.68, 95.4% CI 0.47-0.98, stratified log-rank test one-sided p value=0.0179). More patients had grade 3-4 haematological toxic effects in the chemoradiotherapy group than in the radiotherapy alone group, including leucopenia (61 [63.5%] vs none), neutropenia (55 [57.3%] vs none), and thrombocytopenia (28 [29.2%] vs two [2.0%]). Grade 3 infection was more common with chemoradiotherapy (12 patients [12.5%]) than with radiotherapy (four patients [4.1%]). Incidences of grade 3-4 pneumonitis and late lung toxicity were similar between groups. There were seven treatment-related deaths: three of 100 patients (3.0%) in the chemoradiotherapy group and four of 100 (4.0%) in the radiotherapy group. Interpretation(s): For a select group of elderly patients with locally advanced NSCLC, combination chemoradiotherapy provides a clinically significant benefit over radiotherapy alone, and should be considered for this population.

OBJECTIVE: To investigate the value of split-bolus 2-phase with virtual non-enhanced scan in CT urography., METHODS: Eighty (80) patients with urinary obstruction were divided into two groups, group A was traditional CT urography scan, group B was split-bolus 2-phase with virtual non-enhanced scan. The scan sequence of group A included conventional scan first, then enhanced scan in arterial phase, parenchyma phase and excretion delayed phase after the injection of 100 mL contrast agent. The scan sequence of group B included conventional scan and enhanced scan following two bolus injection of contrast; the first injection of contrast was 40 mL, the second injection was 60 mL with 15-30 minutes delay, then enhanced scan was conducted in arterial and parenchymal phase, the parenchymal phase scan was performed with dual energy scanning sequence. The image quality of urinary collecting system, the detection of urinary obstructive lesion, and radiation dose were compared between the two groups., RESULTS: Between the two imaging methods, the imaging quality of urinary system did not show significant difference, but radiation dose was statistically significant difference. The radiation dose of split-bolus 2-phase with virtual non-enhanced scan was only 55% of traditional CTU scan., CONCLUSION: Split-bolus2 phase with virtual non-enhanced scan could obtain the same image quality as tranditional CTU, while reducing the approximately half the radiation dose.",Excluded
1028,"Surgeon's radiation exposure during percutaneous vertebroplasty. OBJECT: In this study the authors evaluated levels of radiation exposure to surgeons' protected and unprotected hands during fluoroscopically assisted vertebroplasty., METHODS: The amount of radiation administered to 30 patients during 41 procedures in a controlled prospective trial over 6 months was assessed, comparing radiation exposure to the right and left hands in two neurosurgeons. Effective skin doses were evaluated using thermoluminescent finger dosimeters (ring dosimeters). The ratios of finger dosimeter exposure were compared between the glove-protected and unprotected left hands of two surgeons and both unprotected right hands. In addition, dose-area product (DAP) and fluoroscopy times were recorded in all patients. The mean treatment-effective dose to the surgeons' hands was 0.49 +/- 0.4 mSv in the glove-protected left hand and 1.81 +/- 1.31 mSv in the unprotected left hand (p < 0.05). The mean effective hand doses were 0.59 +/- 0.55 mSv in the unprotected right hand of the glove-protected surgeon and 0.62 +/- 0.55 mSv in the unprotected right hand of the control surgeon. The total corresponding fluoroscopy time was 38.55 minutes for the protected surgeon and 41.23 minutes for the unprotected one (p > 0.05). Lead glove shielding resulted in a radiation dose reduction of 75%. The total DAP for all procedures was 256,496 mGy/cm2 and 221,408 mGy/cm2 (p > 0.05) for the protected and unprotected surgeons, respectively., CONCLUSIONS: This study emphasizes the importance of surgeons wearing lead glove protection on their leading hands during percutaneous vertebroplasty procedures and demonstrates a 75% reduction rate of exposure to radiation.",Excluded
1602,"Radiation-related cranial nerve palsy in patients with nasopharyngeal carcinoma. BACKGROUND: Cranial nerve palsy is a rare complication after patients with nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) receive radiotherapy using a technique that delivers 180-200 centigrays (cGy) per day. Cranial neuropathy is of particular clinical interest in terms of making a differential diagnosis, because it is also a common presenting manifestation in patients with NPC. Cranial neuropathy may lead to distressing signs and symptoms in these patients, and their treatment has not been addressed in previous reports. This article presents the authors' experience with radiotherapy-related cranial nerve palsy in patients with NPC., METHODS: Nineteen patients were diagnosed with radiation-related neuropathy. Patients with recurrent tumors or with a suspicion of persistent or recurrent tumors were excluded. Most patients were treated using 180 cGy or 200 cGy per fraction per day. The total dose was 7000-13,000 cGy to the nasopharynx and 5000-9000 cGy to the neck. Unilateral vocal cord paralysis alone and hearing loss were not included in the analysis., RESULTS: There were 15 male patients and 4 female patients. The latency before palsy occurred was 12-240 months. Single nerve palsy developed in four patients, including two patients with hypoglossal palsy and two patients with recurrent laryngeal palsy. Two patients had three nerve palsies each. The other 13 patients presented with 2 nerve palsies each. Vagus and hypoglossal palsy appeared to be a frequent combination and occurred in 11 patients. Overall, there were 17 patients with hypoglossal palsy (7 bilateral, 8 left-sided, and 2 right-sided), 11 patients with vagus palsy (2 bilateral, 7 left-sided, and 2 right-sided), 6 patients with recurrent laryngeal nerve palsy (5 bilateral), and 2 patients with accessory palsies (all bilateral). Marked neck fibrosis was present in 12 patients. Patients who had vocal cord paralysis suffered from easy choking and hoarseness. Severe respiratory difficulty occurred in two patients who had bilateral vocal cord palsy. Surgical procedures included laryngoplasty, tracheostomy, and gastrostomy. Quality of life improved considerably after patients underwent surgery., CONCLUSIONS: Radiotherapy-related cranial nerve palsy may occur in patients with NPC after they receive conventional radiotherapy. Hypoglossal nerve palsy was found the most frequently in this series, followed by vagus nerve palsy and recurrent laryngeal nerve palsy. Neck fibrosis and the course of the three nerves through the neck may be important risk factors for the development of palsy. The diagnosis must be made only after the possibilities of tumor-induced palsy and idiopathic palsy are excluded. Surgery is helpful in improving the quality of life in many patients.

Purpose: A phase I/II study on carbon ion radiotherapy for Stage I non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) was first conducted between 1994 and 1999 and determined the optimal dose. Second, a Phase II study using the optimal dose was performed. The purpose of the present study was to clarify the local control and 5-year survival rates. Methods and Materials: Between April 1999 and December 2000, 50 patients with 51 primary lesions were treated. Using a fixed dose of 72 GyE in nine fractions over 3 weeks, the primary tumors were irradiated with carbon ion beams alone. The average age of the patients was 74.5 years. Thirty-three (66%) of these were medically inoperable. Local control and survival were determined by using the Kaplan-Meier method and the data were statistically processed by using the log-rank test. Result(s): All patients were observed for a minimum of 5 years or until death with a median follow-up time of 59.2 months (range, 6.0-83.0 months). The local control rate for all patients was 94.7%. The patients' 5-year cause-specific survival rate was 75.7% (IA: 89.4; IB: 55.1), and overall survival 50.0% (IA: 55.2; IB: 42.9). No toxic reactions in the lung greater than Grade 3 were detected. Conclusion(s): Carbon ion radiotherapy, a new treatment modality with superior benefits in terms of quality of life and activity of daily living, has been proven as a valid alternative to surgery for Stage I NSCLC and to offer particular benefits, especially for elderly and inoperable patients. © 2007 Elsevier Inc.

1007,"Radiotherapy for Pancreatic Neuroendocrine Tumors. Purpose: Pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (PNTs) are rare malignant neoplasms considered to be resistant to radiotherapy (RT), although data on efficacy are scarce. We reviewed our institutional experience to further delineate the role of RT for patients with PNTs. Methods and Materials: Between 1986 and 2006, 36 patients with PNTs were treated with RT to 49 sites. Of these 36 patients, 23 had radiographic follow-up data, which were used to determine the tumor response rate and freedom from local progression. Long-term toxicity was graded according to the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events. Result(s): The overall response rate to RT was 39% (13% complete response, 26% partial response, 56% stable disease, and 4% progressive disease). A significant difference in the freedom from local progression between the groups receiving either greater than or less than the median 2 Gy/fraction biologically equivalent dose of 49.6 Gy was found, with all radiographic progression occurring in patients who had received <=32 Gy. The actuarial 3-year local freedom from progression rate was 49%. Palliation was achieved in 90% of patients, with either improvement or resolution of symptoms after RT. Of 35 patients, 33 had metastatic disease at their referral for RT, and the median overall survival for this patient population was 2 years. Three long-term Grade 3 or greater toxicities were recorded. Conclusion(s): RT is an effective modality for achieving local control in patients with PNTs. RT produces high rates of symptomatic palliation and freedom from local progression. Prospective trials of radiotherapy for PNTs are warranted. © 2009 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.",Excluded

PURPOSE: To calculate radiation doses of rhenium-186 ((186)Re) etidronate in painful bone metastases using quantitative bone single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) and to determine the threshold dose for predicting pain relief. We also wanted to determine whether technetium-99m ((99m)Tc) methylene diphosphonate (MDP) concentrations predict radiation doses of (186)Re etidronate in painful lesions., MATERIALS AND METHODS: Forty-eight patients with breast and prostate cancer were evaluated. Patients received therapeutic doses of (186)Re etidronate. The area under the pain over time curve (AUPC) was measured for 8 weeks after treatment. Response was calculated as the percentage of change in AUPC. Quantitative bone SPECT (QBS)-measured concentration of (186)Re etidronate was used for calculating radiation doses. Receiver operating characteristics curve analysis determined the radiation dose threshold that best separated responders from nonresponders. SPECT-measured concentration of (186)Re etidronate in the urinary bladder was correlated with its concentration in the voided urine. Concentration of (99m)Tc MDP was compared with radiation doses to painful metastases., RESULTS: The radiation dose threshold was 2.10 Gy. For a decrease of 50% in the AUPC, the positive predictive value (PPV) of this value was 75% and the negative predictive value (NPV) was 88%. For a decrease in pain of 33%, the PPV was 84% and the NPV was 81%. In prostate cancer patients only, the PPV was 81% and the NPV was 92%. The correlation between in vivo/in vitro measured urine concentration was 0.90. The correlation between (99m)Tc MDP concentration and radiation doses of (186)Re etidronate was 0.92., CONCLUSION: QBS-measured radiation doses of (186)Re etidronate in painful metastases are a good predictor of pain relief.

543,"Prescribed dose versus calculated dose of spinal cord in standard head and neck irradiation assessed by 3-D plan. Background and Purpose: Spinal cord toxicity can be dreaded complication while treating head and neck cancer by conventional radiotherapy. Cord sparing approach is applied by two phase planning in conventional head neck radiotherapy. In spite of cord sparing approach spinal cord still receives considerable scatter dose. Our study aims to do the volumetric analysis of spinal cord dosimetry and to correlate with the clinical findings. Material(s) and Method(s): Treatment planning was done in two phases. First phase treatment fi elds include gross disease- both tumor and involved nodes. in the second phase, treatment field shrinkage was done to cover the gross disease sparing the spinal cord. These fields are termed as off-cord fields. 42 patients with histological proven squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck region were analysed with two groups. In Group A, 46 Gy was given in 23 fractions, and then tumor-boost with off-cord fi eld received 24 Gy in 12 fractions. In Group B 50 Gy was prescribed in 25 fractions initially, then off-cord fi eld given 20 Gy in 10 fractions to analyze theoutcome. Planning Computed tomography (CT) scan was done Philips Brilliance 16 slice CT scan machine, and contouring and dose calculation were done at ASHA treatment planning software. Result(s): Maximum dose and dose at 1 cm3, 2 cm3, and 5 cm3 were calculated. Maximum dose to cord was 52.6 Gy (range 48.1-49.7 Gy) in Group A and 54.3 Gy (range 51.48-52.33 Gy) in Group B initially. Off-cord fi elds received mean dose 8.07 Gy (85.85% of maximum) in Group A and 5.47 Gy (86.84% of maximum) in Group B.

Mean survival times were 4.32 +/- 2.63 years in patients with mouth dryness or sores, 4.26 +/- 2.90 years in patients with fatigue, and 5.60 +/- 2.94 years in patients with a decline in hearing. The mean global qol score was 74.21 (95% ci: 72.22 to 76.20). At a significance level of alpha = 0.05, the factors influencing qol were age (p = 0.032), education level (p = 0.001), anxiety score (p < 0.001), depression score (p < 0.001), mouth dryness or sores (p < 0.001), fatigue (p = 0.027), and disease stage (p = 0.044). Conclusions The prevalence rates of mouth dryness or sores, fatigue, decline in hearing, depression, and anxiety were high in npc survivors with a survival time of more than 2 years. These rt-induced symptoms and psychological problems can last for many years after rt. The qol of the npc survivors was good. Factors influencing qol were age, education level, anxiety, depression, mouth dryness or sores, fatigue, and disease stage.

2883,"Increased brain cortical activity during parabolic flights has no influence on a motor tracking task. Previous studies showed that changing forces of gravity as they typically occur during parabolic flights might be responsible for adaptional processes of the CNS. However, until now it has not been differentiated between primary influences of weightlessness and secondary influences due to psycho-physiological factors (e.g., physical or mental strain). With the aim of detecting parabolic flight related changes in central cortical activity, a resting EEG was deduced in 16 subjects before, during and after parabolic flights. After subdividing EEG into alpha-, beta-,delta- and theta-wave bands, an increase in beta-power was noticeable inflight, whereas alpha(1)-power was increased postflight. No changes could be observed for the control group. To control possible effects of cortical activation, a manual tracking task with mirror inversion was performed during either the phase of weightlessness or during the normal gravity phase of a parabolic flight. No differences in performance nor in adaptation could be observed between both groups. A third group, performing under normal and stress-free conditions in a lab showed similar tracking values. We assume that the specific increase in brain activity is a sign of an increase in arousal inflight. This does support previous assumptions of non-specific stressors during parabolic flights and has to be considered as a relevant factor for experiments on central nerve adaptation. Although no influences of stress and/or weightlessness on motor performance and adaptation could be observed, we suggest that an inflight"" control group seems to be more adequate than a laboratory control group to investigate gravity-dependent changes in motor control.""",Excluded
59,"Long-Term Outcomes for Patients With Desmoid Fibromatosis Treated With Radiation Therapy: A 10-Year Update and Re-evaluation of the Role of Radiation Therapy for Younger Patients. Purpose: To update our experience with long-term outcomes in patients with desmoid fibromatosis treated with radiation therapy (RT) and to characterize factors associated with increased risk of local recurrence. Methods and Materials: We reviewed the records of 209 consecutive patients with desmoid fibromatosis treated with RT, either alone or as combined-modality therapy (CMT) with surgery, at our institution from 1965 to 2015. Result(s): Median follow-up time was 98 months (range, 1-509 months). The 5- and 10-year local control (LC) was 71% and 69%, respectively. Fifty-nine patients (28%) experienced a local recurrence at a median time of 23 months (interquartile range, 15-38 months). Among all patients, on multivariable analysis, adjusting for anatomic site, size, age, treatment era (>2005 vs <=2005), treatment approach (RT alone vs CMT), and an interaction between age and treatment, we found only age <=30 years (hazard ratio [HR], 2.94; P =.005; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.38-6.27) and large tumor size >10 cm (HR, 2.51; P =.03; 95% CI, 1.09-5.78) to be correlated with poorer LC. Notably, for patients receiving RT alone, the 5-year LC was 43% for patients <=30 years old versus 75% for >30 years old (P <.001). On multivariable analyses, for patients receiving RT alone, the only factor associated with inferior LC was age <=30 years (HR, 2.87; P =.001; 95% CI, 1.51-5.47). The same was true for patients treated with CMT; age <=30 years was the only factor associated with inferior LC (HR, 5.36; P =.01; 95% CI, 1.40-20.58). Conclusion(s): Among all patients with desmoid fibromatosis, RT is an effective local therapy for tumor control. However, young patients <= 30 years have notably high rates of local recurrence regardless of treatment strategy, which requires further study. Treatment decisions should be risk-adapted by large referral centers with multidisciplinary expertise in desmoid management.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.",Excluded
857,"Volumetric modulated arc therapy with flattening filter free beams for isolated abdominal/pelvic lymph nodes: Report of dosimetric and early clinical results in oligometastatic patients. Background: SBRT is a safe and efficient strategy to locally control multiple metastatic sites. While research in the physics domain for Flattening Filter Free Beams (FFF) beams is increasing, there are few clinical data of FFF beams in clinical practice. Here we reported dosimentric and early clinical data of SBRT and FFF delivery in isolated lymph node oligometastatic patients. Method(s): Between October 2010 and March 2012, 34 patients were treated with SBRT for oligometastatic lymph node metastasis on a Varian TrueBeamTM treatment machine using Volumetric Modulated Arc Therapy (RapidArc). We retrospectively evaluated a total of 25 patients for isolated lymph node metastases in abdomen and/or pelvis treated with SBRT and FFF (28 treatments). Acute toxicity was recorded. Local control evaluation was scored by means of CT scan and/or PET scan. Result(s): All dosimetric results are in line with what published for the same type of stereotactic abdominal lymph node metastases treatments and fractionation, using RapidArc. All 25 FFF SBRT patients completed the treatment. Acute gastrointestinal toxicity was minimal: one patient showed Grade 1 gastrointestinal toxicity. Three other patients presented Grade 2 toxicity. No Grade 3 or higher was recorded. All toxicities were recovered within one week. The preliminary clinical results at the median follow up of 195 days are: complete response in 12 cases, partial response in 11, stable disease in 5, with an overall response rate of 82%; no local progression was recorded. Conclusion(s): Data of dosimetrical findings and acute toxicity are excellent for patients treated with SBRT with VMAT using FFF beams. Preliminary clinical results showed a high rate of local control in irradiated lesion. Further data and longer follow up are needed to assess late toxicity and definitive clinical outcomes. © 2012 Alongi et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",Excluded
896,"A phase II trial of stereotactic body radiation therapy for operable T1N0M0 non-small cell lung cancer: Japan clinical oncology group (JCOG0403). Purpose/Objective(s): Stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) is a rapidly prevailing treatment modality suggesting high effectiveness in the treatment of medically inoperable stage I non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). It has also been applied in operable stage I NSCLC patients, but the prospective data have not been available yet. The purpose of JCOG0403 was to evaluate the safety and efficacy of SBRT in patients with both operable and medically inoperable T1N0M0 NSCLC (UICC 6th ed., 2002), and this is the first report analyzed for operable population. Materials/Methods: The eligibility criteria included histologically or cytologically proven NSCLC, clinical T1N0M0, operable patients assessed by thoracic surgeons, PS 0-2, >= 20 years old, PaO2 >= 60 torr, FEV1.0>= 700 mL, and written informed consent. The prescription was 48 Gy at the isocenter in 4 fractions over 4-8 days. 4-10 MV X rays were allowed. Heterogeneity corrected doses by pencil beam algorithms were used. The GTV included the primary tumor only, CTV margin was not considered, and ITV margin and 5 mm setup margin were added. As a quality assurance program, credentialing of institutions and an individual case review using the Image-guided Therapy Center (ITC) remote review tool were performed. The primary endpoint was the three-year overall survival. The secondary endpoints included overall survival (OS), progression-free survival (PFS), local-progression free survival (LPFS), event-free survival (EFS), toxicity, and patterns of failure. The sample size was determined so that the 95% confidence interval for the estimated 3-year OS would be +/- 10% around expected value of 80%. Result(s): Between July 2004 and January 2007, 65 patientswere registered in this study from15 institutions.The patients characteristics were:male 45, female 20; median age 79 (range, 50-91);median tumor size 21mm(range, 10-30mm); adenocarcinomas 40, squamous cell carcinomas 21, others 4; and PS 0/1/2, 43/20/2. All patients completed the protocol treatment. At the last follow-up in November 2009, median follow-up of censored cases was 45.4 months. of the eligible 64 patients, the 3-year overall survival was 76.0% (95% CI: 63.3% - 84.8%). To date, a total of 25 progressions were observed, and the 3-year PFS, LPFS, and EFS were 54.5% (95% CI: 41.5% - 65.7%), 68.5% (95% CI: 55.5% -78.4%) and 51.4% (95% CI: 38.6% - 62.9%), respectively. Grade 3 toxicity was observed in chest pain 1 (1.5%), dyspnea 2 (3.1%), hypoxia 1 (1.5%), and pneumonitis 2 (3.1%). No grade 4 and 5 toxicity was observed. Conclusion(s): SBRT for operable stage I NSCLC is highly effective with mild toxicity. This treatment has a potential to be an alternative to surgery and should be considered as a treatment option especially in elderly patients.",Excluded
3028,"Effectiveness of Stereotactic Radiotherapy and Bevacizumab for Recurrent High-Grade Gliomas: A Potential Therapy for Isocitrate Dehydrogenase Wild-Type Recurrent High-Grade Gliomas. Objective: This study aimed to evaluate the efficacy of stereotactic radiotherapy combined with bevacizumab (SRT-Bv) compared with Bv treatment for recurrent high-grade gliomas (HGGs). Method(s): Data for patients with recurrent HGGs who received SRT and Bv (n = 29) or Bv (n = 29) between June 2014 and September 2016 were retrospectively analyzed. All patients received conventional radiotherapy (total, 60 Gy) before this study. SRT was administered at a median dose of 42 Gy in 3-7 fractions. The recurrence pattern was classified into 3 groups: in-field, marginal, and out-field. Result(s): The median overall survival in the SRT-Bv group was significantly longer than that in the Bv group (10.4 vs. 5.6 months; P = 0.02). In patients with isocitrate dehydrogenase wild-type tumors, the SRT-Bv treatment significantly prolonged survival more than the Bv treatment (10.9 vs. 8.2 months; P = 0.01). The World Health Organization grade and presence or absence of SRT were significant prognostic factors in the univariate analysis. Besides brain edema in 2 cases and asymptomatic subdural hematoma in 1 case, no other severe adverse effect due to SRT-Bv treatment was recorded. The pattern of recurrence was as follows: in-field, 2 cases (7%); marginal, 8 cases (28%); out-field, 11 cases (38%); no recurrence on radiologic findings, 6 cases (21%); and uncertain, 2 cases (7%). Conclusion(s): SRT-Bv treatment significantly prolonged survival duration more than Bv treatment and provides good local control in patients with recurrent HGGs, especially those with isocitrate dehydrogenase wild-type tumors.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.",Excluded
1420,"Skin cancer in heart transplant recipients: frequency and risk factor analysis. BACKGROUND: The frequency of skin cancer is increased among organ transplant recipients, but the predisposing risk factors are controversial. It is also unclear whether heart transplant patients face an increased risk compared to recipients of other organs, e.g. kidney transplants., METHODS: We performed univariate and multivariate analysis of risk factors for skin cancer in 252 heart transplants and in a control series of 228 kidney transplants followed up at a single center. An extensive dermatologic examination was carried out; baseline features, type of immunosuppression, number of 3A rejection episodes, extent of sunlight exposure and skin type were recorded. Multivariate analysis (Cox regression) included: age at transplantation, sex, skin type (Fitzpatrick's criteria), presence of solar keratosis, presence of warts, type of organ, sunlight exposure., RESULTS: During follow up skin cancer was more common among heart transplants (40, 16 %) than in kidney transplants (16, 7%, p = 0.004). The cumulative incidence of skin cancer by life table analysis increased from 16% after 5 years to 33% after 10 years in heart transplant patients and from 6% to 17% in kidney transplants (p 10000 hours (relative risk = 2.8), but not organ type were significant risk factors., CONCLUSION: Age at transplant, skin type and sunlight exposure, but not type of organ and type of immunosuppressive regimen, are associated with increased risk of skin cancer in heart transplantation.",Excluded
3430,"Treatment of type I endoleaks using transcatheter embolization with onyx. Purpose: To report a single-center experience with transcatheter embolization of type I endoleaks using the liquid embolic agent Onyx, an ethylene vinyl alcohol copolymer. Method(s): Eight patients (4 men; mean age 74.8 years, range 63-86) with 10 type I endoleaks (6 abdominal and 4 thoracic) diagnosed 2 days to 9 years after endovascular repair were treated with Onyx embolization because cuff extension was precluded by an insufficient landing zone in 6 cases and an unsuitable aortic diameter in 2. Endoleaks were accessed with a 4-F diagnostic catheter and a coaxially introduced dimethylsulfoxide- compatible microcatheter. Onyx-34 was predominantly applied due to its high viscosity; patent side branches were coil embolized prior to Onyx delivery in 3 cases. Result(s): Technical success of the procedure was achieved in all cases. The mean volume of Onyx used for abdominal endoleaks was 11.8 mL (range 3.0-25.5) and 19.4 mL (range 4.5- 31.5) for thoracic endoleaks. The average duration of the procedure was 76.7 minutes (range 34.5-110.6), and the average radiation dose area product was 18.8 cGy*cm2 (range 10.6-55.8). Reperfusion of the endoleak was detected in one case 2 days after the procedure. A second case showed an occluded endoleak but a small trace of contrast between the aortic wall and the stent-graft. Non-target embolization was not found in any case. Mean follow-up was 13.2 months (range 8-24). The mean reduction in diameters for thoracic aneurysms after 6 and 12 months was 0.4 and 0.9 cm, respectively, and 0.6 and 1.2 cm, respectively, for abdominal aneurysms. Conclusion(s): Transcatheter embolization of type I endoleaks using Onyx is a simple, safe, and sustainable treatment option with a high primary success rate for cases in which stentgraft extension is not possible. The benefit of additional coil embolization remains uncertain. © 2014 by the INTERNATIONAL SOCIETY OF ENDOVASCULAR SPECIALISTS.",Excluded
413,"Assessing the Association Between Electrical Stimulation Dose, Subsequent Cognitive Function and Depression Severity in Patients Receiving Bilateral Electroconvulsive Therapy for Major Depressive Disorder. OBJECTIVE: To assess the relationship between electrical stimulation administered to patients undergoing bilateral electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) and subsequent measures of cognitive function and depression severity., METHODS: Stimulus dose titrated patients receiving bilateral ECT were assessed with the Cambridge Neuropsychological Test Automated Battery (CANTAB) Spatial Recognition Memory test and Montgomery Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) at baseline, after 4 ECT treatments and on course completion. Changes in CANTAB and MADRS scores were assessed in relation to electrical dosage, initial stimulus dose, and demographic variables using linear mixed models., RESULTS: Data pertained to 143 patients (mean age, 56.85 [SD, 14.94], 43% male). Median change in CANTAB score was -10% (-20% to 5%) after 4 ECT treatments and -10% (-20% to 5%) at course completion. Median change in MADRS score was -22 (-33 to -13) after 4 ECT treatments and -14 (-25 to -7) at course completion. Electrical dosage had no effect on CANTAB or MADRS change scores either after 4 treatments or course completion. Improvement in CANTAB score at end of course was associated with female sex (P < 0.05), higher intelligence quotient (P = 0.01), and age. After 4 treatments, improvement in CANTAB score was associated with younger age (P < 0.001) and higher intelligence quotient (P < 0.01). Improved MADRS score at course completion was associated with older age (P < 0.001 at end of course and after 4 treatments)., CONCLUSIONS: Electroconvulsive therapy has significant antidepressant and cognitive effects which are not associated with the total electrical dose administered. Other, unalterable variables, such as age and sex, have an influence on these effects.",Excluded

The follow-up scans and serum thyroglobulin levels of such patients have been studied. Method(s): Threehundred seventy-eight patients who underwent thyroidectomy for differentiated thyroid carcinoma were studied. Diagnostic scans were obtained with 185 MBq 131I; 7.2 wk afterward, the patients received 489 ablative treatments with 4 GBq 131I. A total of 1575 scans were obtained (pre- and posttreatment scans and 615 follow-up scans). The evolution of serum thyroglobulin levels was determined. Result(s): In all patients, the thyroid-stimulating hormone level was more than 30 muIU/mL. Posttherapy scans showed less uptake than did diagnostic scans or even showed negative findings in 99 patients (21%). In these patients, the mean time between diagnostic scanning and therapy was 7.9 wk. In 61 of these 99 patients (61.6%), follow-up scans have shown negative findings, serum thyroglobulin was less than 3 ng/mL, and antithyroglobulin antibodies were not present. Twenty-three patients (23.2%) have not undergone follow-up scanning yet. In 8 patients (8.1%), follow-up scans showed negative findings but serum thyroglobulin was more than 3 ng/mL. In 7 patients (7.1%), follow-up scans showed less uptake than posttherapy scans, but the findings were not yet negative and thyroglobulin was less than 3 ng/mL.

3478,"Impact of clinical and therapeutic factors on major late complications after radiotherapy with or without concomitant chemotherapy for anal carcinoma. PURPOSE: To investigate factors potentially influencing major late morbidity after sphincter-conserving treatment for anal carcinoma., METHODS AND MATERIALS: Grade 3-4 complications were retrospectively analyzed in 144 evaluable patients (pts), 55 pts after split-course radiotherapy (RT), and 89 after concomitant chemo-RT. First sequence RT delivered a median dose of 39.6 Gy using megavoltage photon beams. Boost treatment used either 192Ir implantation or external beam RT (median dose 20 Gy). Chemotherapy started on day 1 and in 83% of pts consisted of Mitomycin-C (10 mg/m2) and a 5-day infusion of 5-fluorourcil (600-800 mg/m2/day). Uni- and multivariate analyses tested the association of following factors with complication rate: age, gender, stage, anatomic tumor extent, type of biopsy, external RT technique (dose, fraction size, field arrangement), boost type (brachytherapy vs. external), brachytherapy dose and dose rate, overall treatment time, and addition of chemotherapy., RESULTS: Five-year actuarial complication rate was 16%. Two variables were significantly associated with complication rate: anatomic tumor extent (canal or margin vs. both +/- rectum; 10 vs. 31% complications, p = 0.0004) and first sequence prescribed dose (< 39.6 Gy vs. > or = 39.6 Gy; 7 vs. 23% complications, p = 0.012), confirmed as independent factors by Cox analysis. Grade 4 anal morbidity correlated significantly with prior local excision. All six bone complications were observed in pts treated by chemo-RT using large pelvic fields, five occurring in pts older than 66., CONCLUSION: Pts with tumors involving more than one anatomic subsite or treated with the higher first sequence RT dose are at greater risk of major complications. Prior tumor excision and combined modality therapy in older pts appear to favor major anal and bone complications, respectively.",Excluded

Several studies suggest that dietary supplementation with antioxidant can influence the response to chemotherapy as well as the development of adverse side effects caused by treatment with chemotherapeutic agents. Using CBA mouse model, we investigated a clinically potential use of a water-soluble derivative of propolis (WSDP) in the treatment of various cytopenias induced by radiation and/or chemotherapy. Also, the antimetastatic efficiency of WSDP given intraperitoneally alone or in combination with chemotherapeutic agents and their effects on the blood leukocytes count as well as on hematopoiesis were studied. Tumor was a transplantable mammary carcinoma (MCa) of CBA mouse. Metastases in the lung were generated by injecting viable tumor cells intravenously (iv). WSDP (50 or 150 mg/kg) exerted a significant antimetastatic effect (P < 0.001) when given either before or after tumor cell inoculation. In combined treatment WSDP and Epirubicin profoundly inhibited metastasis formation; this synergistic effect is maximal when Epirubicin and WSDP were administrated after tumor cell inoculation. Positive outcome of combined treatment with WSDP and Epirubicin was also found regarding the number of red and white blood cells in peripheral blood while in mice treated with Epirubicin alone the significant drop in all hematological parameters was noticed on day 13 after tumor cell inoculation. Furthermore, when WSDP (50 mg/kg) was given perorally (po) for 20 consecutive days an increased number of exogenous CFUs was found in treated mice. WSDP given either for 20 or 40 days increased cellularity of hematopoietic tissue and the number of leucocytes in peripheral blood; prolonged treatment with WSDP also elevated myeloid and megakaryocytic types of CFUs. To conclude, these findings indicate that the combination of WSDP with chemotherapeutics could increase the antimetastatic potential of chemotherapeutic agents; these findings suggest the benefits of potential clinical trials using WSDP combined with chemotherapeutic agents in order to maximize their antitumor activity and minimize postchemotherapeutic or radiotherapeutic deteriorated reactions.",Excluded

OBJECTIVES: To determine the efficacy of a 0.5-mm lead apron across the patient's abdomen in addition to standard operator protection for the reduction of scatter radiation on operator and patient radiation exposure, BACKGROUND: Cardiac angiography using the radial access compared to the femoral approach is associated with reduced complication rate and improved patient comfort but has significantly increased radiation dose. Improvements in radiation protection are needed, METHODS: We randomly assigned 332 patients undergoing coronary angiography to a group with pelvic lead shielding and a group with standard protection. In each procedure, eight digital dosimeters were used to measure operator radiation dose [under the lead apron, outside the thyroid shield, and at the left side of the head], patient dose at the level of the umbilicus [above and beneath the lead apron], and two on the acrylic shielding and one on the image receptor to measure scattered radiation, RESULTS: Both groups were similar in BMI, procedures performed, and number of sequences. Usage of lead shielding statistically significantly reduced the radiation dose of the operator at all three sites measured: under lead apron [all in microSv]: 0.53 +/- 1.4 vs. 0.17 +/- 0.6, on thyroid collar 5.9 +/- 7.7 vs. 2.9 +/- 3.4, and left side of head 3.3 +/- 3.4 vs. 2.1 +/- 2.2, P<0.001. However the radiation to the patient was doubled from 15.4 +/- 24.1 to 28.9 +/- 81.1, P=0.04 CONCLUSIONS: The use of a pelvic lead shield during radial angiography reduced the operator radiation exposure at multiple measurement sites. However there was an increased exposure to the patient. This balance should be further investigated before the widespread adoption of this method. . Copyright © 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",Excluded
1856,"Magnitude of luminance modulation specifies amplitude of perceived movement. A compelling impression of movement, which is perceptually indistinguishable from a real displacement, can be elicited by patterns containing no spatially displaced elements. An apparent oscillation, w-movement, was generated by a stationary pattern containing a large number of horizontal pairs of spatially adjacent dots modulated in brightness. The observer's task was to adjust the perceived amplitude of the w-motion to match the amplitude of a real oscillation. All of the data can be accounted for by a simple rule: If the relative change in the luminance, W = delta L/L, between two adjacent stationary dots is kept constant, the distance over which these dots appeared to travel in space comprises a fixed fraction of the total distance by which they are separated. The apparent amplitude of the w-motion increases strictly in proportion with luminance contrast, provided that the contrast is represented in the motion-encoding system by a rapidly saturating compressive Weibull transformation. These findings can be explained in terms of bilocal motion encoders comparing two luminance modulations occurring at two different locations.",Excluded
1519,"Staying in bed to benefit ESA's astronauts and Europe's citizens. Since Yuri Gagarin's historic first flight into space in April 1961, it has quickly become evident that the space environment influences the human body in many different ways and causes it to adapt in ways that can lead to problems when returning to Earth's gravity. Much research has been performed in the meantime and our understanding of what happens to our bodies in space improved considerably during the Mir space station and Space Shuttle/Spacelab era. However, many questions, particularly regarding how to counteract those changes that we now know take place, still need to be addressed through studies on the International Space Station (ISS) and through simulations on the ground. As we enter an era in which crews will spend longer periods in space on the ISS and of longer term plans by almost every space-faring nation for missions to Mars, it is clear that much more knowledge is needed, and quickly. Although a few hundred men and women have already travelled into space, the operating environment severely limits the amount of systematic research that can be performed--a situation that is unlikely to change. Other avenues for addressing specific scientific questions in a controlled research environment must therefore be found. One of these complementary alternatives is head-down-tilt bed-rest studies in which volunteers are confined to beds that are tilted -6 deg below the horizontal at the head end. Every activity, including eating, reading, showering, etc., is performed in this position for the duration of the study. This leads to changes in the human body that are very similar to those seen during spaceflight, such as bone-mass and muscle-mass loss, cardiovascular and neuro-sensory deconditioning. The controlled bed-rest setting therefore allows meaningful research into the bodily consequences of spaceflight and possible countermeasures. It also gives the scientific community interested in space-related medical research more ready access to a clinical model. The benefits of these studies go far beyond their space application. Patients bed-ridden because of illness or accidents suffer the same symptoms and can thus also profit from the studies. As a clear indication of this link, the clinicians and researchers involved in the bed-rest campaigns typically spend the majority of their time exploring ""terrestrial"" problems.",Excluded

131,"Potential Functional Variants in DNA Repair Genes Are Associated with Efficacy and Toxicity of Radiotherapy in Patients with Non-Small-Cell Lung Cancer. Background. Lung cancer is one of the leading causes of cancer-related deaths. Radiotherapy, either alone or with chemotherapy, is still the primary treatment for patients with non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). There are variations in how patients with NSCLC respond to radiotherapy and how toxic the therapy is. DNA repair gene polymorphisms are related to cancer development; however, their association with radiotherapy outcomes remains unknown. We hypothesized that gDNA repair gene variation could affect the efficacy and toxicity of radiotherapy in patients with NSCLC. Methods. A total of 486 histologically confirmed patients with NSCLC were recruited from the Shengjing Hospital of China Medical University from July 2015 to September 2019. Eleven potentially functional single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in four DNA repair genes (XRCC1, XRCC2, XPD, and MSH2) were genotyped in these patients. A multiple factor logistic regression analysis was used to assess the association between these SNPs and the efficacy and toxicity of radiotherapy. Results. Three SNPs, rs25487 (XRCC1), rs3218556 (XRCC2), and rs13181 (XPD), were all significantly associated with the efficacy of radiotherapy. The allele frequencies of the rs25487 CC genotype (OR = 0.457, 95% CI = 0.259-0.804, p=0.006) and the rs3218556 AG or AA genotypes (AG genotype: OR = 0.664, 95% CI = 0.442-0.999, p=0.049; AA genotype: OR = 0.380, 95% CI = 0.181-0.795, p=0.008) were both significantly higher in the response group than in the nonresponse group. For rs13181, the radiotherapy efficacy was associated with the heterozygous genotype GT (OR = 1.663, 95% CI = 1.057-2.614,p=0.027). Statistically significant associations between radiation-induced toxic reactions and rs25487 (XRCC1), rs3218556 (XRCC2), and rs13181 (XPD) were also observed. The rs13181GT genotype was associated with lower toxic reactions than the TT genotype (OR = 1.680, 95% CI = 1.035-2.728,p=0.035). Conclusions. The variants rs25487 (XRCC1), rs3218556 (XRCC2), and rs13181 (XPD) all contribute to the efficacy and toxicity of radiotherapy in patients with NSCLC. Our findings may clarify the predictive value of DNA repair genes for prognosis in patients with NSCLC after radiotherapy. Further investigation of more genes and samples should be performed to confirm our findings.Copyright © 2020 Zhiguang Yang and Zhaoyu Liu.",Excluded
683,"Differences in the sensations of cold on the anterior torso of control and spinal-cord-transected individuals. Application of cold stimuli to the sentient portion of the anterior torso of 12 spinal-cord-transected individuals (patients) and to comparable sites of 11 control participants showed that thresholds are lower for women than for men and that the difference between the sexes is maintained following spinal-cord transection. Patients of both sexes were more sensitive to cold stimuli than were controls. Estimates of stimulus intensity showed that participants reliably distinguished the 3 cool stimuli but that control women offered significantly larger estimates than control men. Spinal-cord transection produced an increase in the intensity of the sensations in women and a reduction in men. The changes in sensory perception that follow spinal-cord injury extend throughout the somatosensory system and involve all modalities. These changes cannot be explained as a simple release from inhibition. Copyright ((c) 2006 APA, all rights reserved).",Excluded
1221,"Extreme solar event of AD775: Potential radiation exposure to crews in deep space. The existence of a historically large cosmic event in AD774 or 775, of probable solar origin, has recently been confirmed from records of 14C levels in tree rings located at widely separated locations on Earth, 10Be records in polar ice cores, and historical records of aurora sightings. Usoskin et al (Astronomy & Astrophysics, 2013) suggest that such an event, of solar origin, would have a proton fluence of 4.5 1010 cm-2 at energies above 30 MeV, with a hard energy spectrum comparable to the event of 23 February 1956. In this work we investigate the possible radiation exposures to crews of missions on the surface of Mars, from such an event. In this work we use the HZETRN radiation transport code, originally developed at NASA Langley Research Center, and the Computerized Anatomical Male and Female human geometry models to estimate exposures for a variety of aluminum shield areal densities similar to those provided by a spacesuit, surface lander, and permanent habitat on the Martian surface. Comparisons of the predicted organ exposures with recently-recommended radiation exposure limits are made. Potential health effects on crews, of such an event, are also discussed.",Excluded
432,"Surgeon-performed Ultrasound for the Staging of Acute Diverticulitis: Preliminary Results of a Prospective Study. INTRODUCTION: Although contrast-enhanced abdominal computed tomography (CEACT) is still considered the gold standard for the assessment of suspected acute diverticulitis, in recent years the use of point-of-care ultrasound (POCUS) has been spreading more and more in this setting. The aim of this study is to compare CEACT to POCUS for the diagnosis and staging of suspected acute diverticulitis. METHOD(S): This is a prospective study conducted on 55 patients admitted to the Emergency Department of two Italian Hospitals with a clinical suspicion of acute diverticulitis between January 2014 and December 2017. All the patients included underwent POCUS first and CEACT immediately afterwards, with the diagnosis and the staging reported according to the Hinchey (H) classification modified by Wasvary et al. Three surgeons performed all the POCUS and the same two radiologists retrospectively analyzed all the CEACT images. The radiologists were informed of the clinical suspicion but unaware of the POCUS findings. The CEACT was used as the gold standard for the comparison. RESULT(S): The final cohort included 30 (55%) females and 25 (45%) males. The median age was 62 (24-88) and the median body mass index was 26 (19-42).Forty-six out of 55 patients had a confirmed diagnosis of acute diverticulitis on both POCUS and CEACT, whereas in seven patients the diagnosis was not confirmed by both methods. POCUS sensitivity and specificity were 98% and 88% respectively. POCUS positive and negative predictive values were 98% and 88% respectively. POCUS accuracy was 96%.POCUS classified 33 H1a, 11 H1b, 1 H2 and 1 H3 acute diverticulitis. This staging was confirmed in all patients but three (93%) by CEACT. CONCLUSION(S): Point-of-care ultrasound appeared a reliable technique for the diagnosis and the staging of clinically suspected H1 and H2 acute diverticulitis. It could contribute in saving time and resources and in avoiding unnecessary radiation exposure to most patients. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Level III.

1651,"S-R difference in V1-V2 is a novel criterion for differentiating the left from right ventricular outflow tract arrhythmias. AIM: The correct estimation of the VA origin as RVOT or LVOT results in reduced ablation duration reduced radiation exposure and decreased number of vascular access. In our study, we aimed to detect the predictive value of S-R difference in V1-V2 for differentiating the left from right ventricular outflow tract arrhythmias., METHODS: We included 123 patients with symptomatic frequent premature ventricular outflow tract contractions who underwent successful catheter ablation (70 male, 53 female; mean age 46.2 +/- 13.9 years, 61 RVOT, 62 LVOT origins). S-R difference in V1-V2 was calculated with this formula on the 12-lead surface ECG: (V1S + V2S) - (V1R + V2R). Conventional ablation was performed in 101 (82.1%) patients, CARTO electroanatomic mapping system was used in 22 (17.9%) patients., RESULTS: V1-2 SRd was found to be significantly lower for LVOT origins than RVOT origins (p < .001). The cutoff value of V1-2 SRd obtained by ROC curve analysis was 1.625 mV for prediction of RVOT origin (sensitivity: 95.1%, specificity: 85.5%, positive predictive value: 86.5%, negative predictive value: 94.5%). The area under the curve (AUC) was 0.929 (p < .001)., CONCLUSION: S-R difference in V1-V2 is a novel and simple electrocardiographic criterion for accurately differentiating RVOT from LVOT sites of ventricular arrhythmia origins. The use of this simple ECG measurement could improve the accuracy of OTVA localization, could be beneficial for decreasing ablation duration and radiation exposure.

3196,"Outcomes of carotid angioplasty and stenting for radiation-associated stenosis. BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: In light of their high surgical risk, carotid angioplasty and stent placement may be preferred in patients with radiation-associated carotid stenosis. The purpose of this study was to determine the procedural complication rate, patency, and clinical outcomes after carotid angioplasty and stent placement in this small group of high-risk patients., METHODS: Sixteen patients (mean age, 65 years; 5 women and 11 men) who received radiation therapy for head and/or neck malignancy subsequently developed carotid stenosis (mean, 84%; range, 70%-99%) in a total of 19 carotid arteries, which were treated with angioplasty and stent placement. The patients were followed for a mean time of 28 months (range, 5-78 months) with periodic Doppler studies, angiography, CT angiography, or clinically., RESULTS: In the total 19 stented carotid arteries, 23 procedures were performed (22 stent placement procedures and one repeat angioplasty). The procedural stroke rate was 1/23 (4%). The procedural transient ischemic attack rate was 0/23 (0%). There was one other observed complication: a puncture site hematoma. The 30-day postprocedure complication rate was 0/23 (0%); no neurologic symptoms were reported. Fifteen of the 19 vessels (79%) developed no new stenosis throughout the follow-up period. Two of 19 (11%) vessels had repeat angioplasty and stent placement; 1/19 (5%) had a repeat angioplasty. One restented vessel has remained patent for 50 months. Another restented vessel required a third stent placement 17 months after the second. Two of 19 (11%) vessels occluded per Doppler examination 14 and 22 months postprocedure., CONCLUSION: Angioplasty and stent placement have low rates of complications and restenosis in the treatment of radiation-associated carotid occlusive disease.",Excluded
708,"Age effects in identifying and localising dichotic stimuli: a corpus callosum deficit?. In the present study, dichotic listening performance of 31 older adults was compared with performance of 25 younger adults under free and focused attention conditions. In addition to an age-related general decrease in performance, we observed in the focused attention condition increased asymmetry in the elderly group: the decrease of recall performance was stronger for the left ear (LE) then for the right ear (RE), while the increase of localisation errors were greater for the RE than for LE. Identifying and localising digits appear to be different process mediated predominantly by the left and right hemisphere, respectively. Since age-related reduced performance is strongest for the ear ipsilateral to the hemisphere dominant to that particular function, these finding may be ascribed to decline of corpus callosum functioning resulting in decrease interhemispheric interaction rather than to a selective decline of right hemisphere functions.",Excluded
867,"Quantitative assessment of left atrial volume by electrocardiographic-gated contrast-enhanced multidetector computed tomography. BACKGROUND: Left atrial (LA) volume is a predictor of cardiovascular events. Information on LA volume is available on contrast-enhanced electrocardiogram (EGC)-gated multidetector computed tomography (MDCT) scans., OBJECTIVE: To assess interobserver and intraobserver reproducibility of 3-dimensional threshold-based volume (3DTV) and 2-dimensional (2D) measurements for the assessment of LA volumes with contrast-enhanced cardiac 64-slice MDCT., METHODS: Contrast-enhanced 64-slice MDCT (0.6-mm slice thickness, 120 kVp, 850 mAseff) was performed in 96 consecutive subjects (mean age 52 years; 48% women) as a subset of the Rule Out Myocardial Infarction using Computer Assisted Tomography trial. Two observers independently measured maximal (LAV(max)) and minimal (LAV(min)) LA volumes with (1) a modified Simpson's method (3DTV) based on delineation of LA areas in axial slices and (2) estimated LA volumes typically used in 2D echocardiography (area length and prolate ellipse). Interobserver and intraobserver reproducibility for each method as well as correlations between the methods were calculated., RESULTS: Interobserver (n = 96) and intraobserver (n = 20) variability was significantly lower for 3DTV (8%) than for area length (13%; P < 0.001) or prolate ellipse (16%; P < 0.001). 2D-based measurements rendered significantly lower LA volumes than did 3DTV (area length: -17% and -22%; prolate ellipse: -43% and -46% for LAV(max) and LAV(min), respectively; P < 0.001 for all). By 3DTV, mean LA volume was 90.4 +/- 24.5 mL for LAV(max) and 52.5 +/- 17.6 mL for LAV(min)., CONCLUSION: ECG-gated contrast-enhanced cardiac MDCT offers volumetric assessment of LA volume with excellent reproducibility without additional contrast administration or radiation exposure. 3D measures of LA volume are more reproducible and render larger volumes than 2D-derived estimates, typically used in echocardiography.",Excluded
204,"Relationships between nasopharyngeal carcinoma and radioactive elements in soils in China. Earlier comparisons of epidemiological and geochemical maps of China disclosed associations between high mortality rates from nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) and low contents of magnesium in the soil. More recent work has shown that high rates of NPC are also associated with high levels of uranium and thorium in the soil. These latest findings are consistent with the earlier ones, since uranium and thorium occur predominantly in acid rocks poor in magnesium. Uranium and thorium are radioactive, and their progeny include radioactive elements such as radium and radon. Whether or not naturally occurring radioactive elements could be risk factors in NPC should, therefore, be further investigated. Direct carcinogenic properties of radon are well known, but in connection with NPC possibilities for reactivation of virus by natural ionizing radiation should also be considered.

3369,"The Impact of Radiation Dose and Fractionation on Outcomes for Limited-Stage Small-Cell Lung Cancer. Purpose: To review the treatment outcomes of limited-stage small-cell lung cancer (LS-SCLC) patients and to compare the outcomes among three groups in which the total radiation doses were 45 Gy with accelerated hyperfractionation (AHF), <54 Gy with standard fractionation (SF), and >=54 Gy with SF. Methods and Materials: LS-SCLC patients that had been treated with chemoradiotherapy between 1997 and 2007 at Aichi Cancer Center Hospital were reviewed in this study. Of the 127 eligible patients, there were 37 patients in the AHF group, 29 in the SF <54 Gy group, and 61 in the SF >=54 Gy group. Result(s): Fifty-five patients (43%) were alive at the time of this analysis, and the median follow-up time of the surviving patients was 33 months. The median survival times were 30.0 months (95% confidence interval [CI] 16.3-43.7) for the AHF group, 14.0 months (CI 6.6-21.4) for the SF <54 Gy group, and 41.0 months (CI 33.9-48.1) for the SF >= 54 Gy group. As for the local control rates, and the overall and progression-free survival rates, all outcomes were significantly lower in the SF <54 Gy group than in the other two groups, although no significant difference was found between the AHF and SF >=54 Gy groups. Conclusion(s): These results suggest the importance of a high dose of radiation when using once-daily regimen. This study will support future prospective studies to establish optimal radiation doses and fractionation. © 2010 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.",Excluded
783,"Computed tomography-guided interstitial 125iodine seed brachytherapy as a salvage therapy for recurrent spinal bone metastases after radiotherapy. Purpose: To evaluate the feasibility, efficacy, and safety of permanent 125I seed interstitial brachytherapy in patients with recurrent spinal bone metastases under CT guidance. Material(s) and Method(s): From November 2010 to November 2015, 17 patients who met the inclusion criteria were retrospectively reviewed. There were 12 men and 5 women with a median age of 56 years (range 24-83 years). There were 10 lung carcinomas, 4 esophagus carcinomas , 1 liver cancer, 1 breast cancer, and 1 kidney carcinoma . 6 had squamous cell carcinoma, 8 were adenocarcinoma, 3 others respectively. All patients suffered varying degrees of pain before seed implantation, ranging from 1 to 9 on the NRS. Mean NRS scores before implantation was 6.88 +/- 2.25 respectively. Regarding neurologic function, 2 grade Bs, 2 grade Cs, 3 grade Ds and 10 grade Es. All patients with recurrent spinal bone metastases had received conventional EBRT. During the procedure, patients remained in a prone position to facilitate CT guidance. We measured the pedicle angle and the distance of the puncture point. The depth of the puncture point to the pedicle was also borne in mind. Needles were inserted through the anterior portion of the lateral images, in the interval between the pedicle and the vertebral body, or with a pedicle or paraspinal approach, respectively. Seeds were implanted 1.0 cm from the spinal cord, to minimize radiation damage. Immediately after the procedure, a CT scan was obtained to confirm the location of the seeds in case of any need for supplementary implantation. The number of 125I seeds implanted ranged from 18 to 62 (median 30) with specific activity of 0.5-0.8 mCi (median 0.75 mCi). The post-plan showed that the actuarial D90 of 125I seeds were 60.5-154 Gy(median 106 Gy). The follow-up period ranged from 1 to 59 months (median 7 months). The local control rate was calculated by the Kaplan-Meier method. Result(s): For all patients, the 1-,2-year overall survival rates were 74.8%, 49.8%, respectively, with a median of 15 months (range, 1-59 months), the 1-, 2-year local control rates were 54.1%, 36.1%, respectively, with a median of 14 months (range, 1-59 months). During the follow-up period, 5.9% (1/17) died from metastases, 5.9% (1/17) died from developed local recurrence,11.8% (2/17) died from primary tumors, 5.9% (1/17) died from another reason, while 70.6% (12/17) remained alive,100% experienced pain relief, and mean NRS scores after implantation was 2.06 +/- 2.08 respectively.

3191,"Importance of surveillance and success of salvage strategies after definitive chemoradiation in patients with esophageal cancer. Purpose: Patients with esophageal carcinoma (EC) who are treated with definitive chemoradiotherapy (bimodality therapy [BMT]) experience frequent relapses. In a large cohort, we assessed the timing, frequency, and types of relapses during an aggressive surveillance program and the value of the salvage strategies. Patients and Methods: Patients with EC (N = 276) who received BMT were analyzed. Patients who had surgery within 6 months of chemoradiotherapy were excluded to reduce bias. We focused on local relapse (LR) and distant metastases (DM) and the salvage treatment of patients with LR only. Standard statistical methods were applied. Result(s): The median follow-up time was 54.3 months (95% CI, 48.4 to 62.4). First relapses included LR only in 23.2% (n = 64), DM with or without LR in 43.5% (n = 120), and no relapses in 33.3% (n = 92) of patients. Final relapses included no relapses in 33.3%, LR only in 14.5%, DM only in 15.9%, and DM plus LR in 36.2% of patients. Ninety-one percent of LRs occurred within 2 years and 98% occurred within 3 years of BMT. Twenty-three (36%) of 64 patients with LR only underwent salvage surgery, and their median overall survival was 58.6 months (95% CI, 28.8 to not reached) compared with those patients with LR only who were unable to undergo surgery (9.5 months; 95% CI, 7.8 to 13.3). Conclusion(s): Unlike in patients undergoing trimodality therapy, for whom surveillance/salvage treatment plays a lesser role,1 in the BMT population, approximately 8% of all patients (or 36% of patients with LR only) with LRs occurring more than 6 months after chemoradiotherapy can undergo salvage treatment, and their survival is excellent. Our data support vigilant surveillance, at least in the first 24 months after chemotherapy, in these patients.Copyright © 2014 by American Society of Clinical Oncology. All rights reserved.",Excluded
2143,"Utility of positron emission tomography/computed tomography in extranodal natural killer/T-cell lymphoma. Background: Natural killer (NK/) T-cell lymphoma, nasal type, is an aggressive form of extranodal lymphoma that is common in Asia, but rare in Europe and North America. Although NK/T-cell lymphoma involves upper aerodigestive sites such as the nasal cavity and nasopharynx, it frequently involves other extranodal sites, including the gastrointestinal tract, bone marrow, adrenal gland, and skin. Because of the frequency of extranodal site involvement, pretreatment evaluation of disease extension is important for staging and treatment. Recently, 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (18F-FDG) positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) was evaluated for its usefulness in the prognosis and treatment response of aggressive B-cell lymphoma and Hodgkin's lymphoma, and relevant results were obtained. Many studies have evaluated the value of PET/CT for various types of B-cell lymphomas, but other similar studies involving T-cell and NK-cell lymphomas are rare. In the present study, we compared the utility of PET/CT and conventional modalities, particularly CT, in extranodal NK/T-cell lymphoma. Patients and Method: From January 2006 to April 2010, 19 untreated patients with extranodal NK/T-cell lymphoma (11 males and 8 females; median age 61 years; range 13-90 years) were included in the study. PET/CT and conventional procedures (e.g., CTs and biopsies) were compared and evaluated for their abilities to detect tumor lesions and their influence in staging and treatment strategies. PET/CT was performed as an initial staging procedure. In addition to PET/CT, all patients underwent initial staging workups, including whole-body CT with contrast media, biopsies from the bone marrow and other sites, and panendoscopies of the upper aerodigestive tract. Patients were evaluated for clinical stage by both evaluation modalities (PET/CT and conventional modalities) according to the Ann Arbor Staging System, and treatment strategies were first planned based on staging results. Following PET/CT, the clinical stage was reevaluated in each patient, and treatment strategies were decided based on the re-staging results. Result(s): Seven patients (37%) had bone marrow involvement, eight (42%) were in Ann Arbor stage I-II, and 11 (58%) had a systemic dissemination. Most patients with systemic dissemination (9/11, 82%) had cutaneous lesions. The median number of disease sites was 4 (range, 1-15). The median number of positive lesions was 3 (range, 1-15) by PET/CT compared to 2 (range, 0-14) by CT (p = 0.12). Using PET/CT, 108 lesions (93%) were detected, and at least one FDG-avid lesion was observed at initial staging workups in all patients. In contrast, 70 lesions (60%) were detected by CT, and three patients (16%) did not show any positive lesion. Two lesions (2%) at the nasal cavity that were detected by biopsy were undetectable by either PET/CT or CT. The nodal and extranodal regions were separately evaluated by PET/CT and conventional modalities. In total, 28 nodal lesions were detected: all (100%) were positive by PET/CT and 26 (93%) by CT. Conversely, 89 extranodal lesions were detected, and 83 (93%) and 44 (49%) were positive by PET/CT and CT (p = 0.003), respectively. For the detection of upper aerodigestive lesions, PET/CT and CT demonstrated similar results: 23 lesions (92%) vs. 17 (68%), respectively. Notably, PET/CT was superior to CT in detecting cutaneous lesions [31 lesions (100%) vs. 19 lesions (61%), respectively; p = 0.026]. Bone marrow involvement was confirmed pathologically in only seven patients; four cases (57%) were positive by PET/CT and none by CT. Using conventional modalities, 11 patients (58%) were in the localized stage and eight (42%) were in the advanced stage. Using PET/CT, eight (42%) were in stage I-II and 11 (58%) were in stage III-IV. Most patients received chemotherapy plus local irradiation in stage I-II, and intensive chemotherapy with or without hematopoietic stem cell transplantation in stage III-IV. One patient did not receive treatment because of unwillingness for treatment and older age. PET/CT findin s altered the stage and treatment strategy in four (21%) and two cases (11%). Conclusion(s): In extranodal NK/T-cell lymphoma, PET/CT demonstrated a high detection rate for nodal and extranodal lesions, except in the bone marrow. PET/CT may have an impact on treatment strategy and is essential for risk-adapted treatment.",Excluded
2197,"Usefulness of additional coronary calcium scoring in low-dose CT coronary angiography with prospective ECG-triggering impact on total effective radiation dose and diagnostic accuracy. RATIONALE AND OBJECTIVES: To determine the impact of additional coronary calcium scoring on total effective radiation dose and diagnostic accuracy of low-dose computed tomography coronary angiography (CTCA) with prospective electrocardiogram (ECG) triggering., MATERIALS AND METHODS: Sixty-one consecutive patients underwent 64-slice CTCA using prospective ECG triggering, calcium scoring, and invasive quantitative coronary angiography, the latter served as standard of reference. Diagnostic accuracy was calculated for CTCA, calcium scoring, and for the combination of both. Receiver operator characteristic analyses were performed to determine cutoffs for prediction of significant coronary artery stenoses., RESULTS: Mean effective radiation dose was 2.1 + or - 0.7 mSv (range, 1.0-3.3 mSv) for CTCA and 1.1 + or - 0.1 mSv (range, 0.9-1.4 mSv) for calcium scoring. Per-patient sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value were 100%, 85.7%, 89.2%, and 100% for CTCA, and 72.7%, 82.1%, 82.8%, and 71.9% for calcium scoring. Adding calcium-scoring with a cutoff at 133 in patients aged >50.7 years with nondiagnostic CTCA improved the respective values of diagnostic accuracy of the entire study population to 100%, 96.4%, 97.1%, and 100%; the added value of calcium scoring was confined to only three patients (5%), who were reclassified from false positive to true negative., CONCLUSION: Specificity and PPV of low-dose CTCA may be further improved by combining it with coronary calcium scoring. However, only a fraction of patient may benefit, whereas exposing the entire population to more than 50% increase in effective radiation dose. Copyright 2010 AUR. Published by Elsevier Inc.

196,"Detection of suspected recurrent pancreatic adeno-carcinoma: Comparison of fluorine-18-fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose Positron Emission Tomography/Computed Tomography (PET) with contrast-enhanced Computed Tomography (CT) and serum CA 19.9. AIM: To establish the value of PET in the detection of suspected recurrent pancreatic adeno-carcinoma previously operated in comparison to contrast-enhanced multidetector CT and serum CA19.9. METHOD(S): Twenty-two patients (6 men, 16 women - mean age 77.6+/-2), previously operated for pancreatic adeno-carcinoma with suspected disease recurrence (increased CA19.9 > 40U/ml) were enrolled. Both PET and CT were performed in all cases. After visual analysis, maximum Standardized Uptake Values (SUVmax) of PET focal uptakes were calculated. PET data were compared to CT findings. The value of serum CA19.9 was also compared with the SUVmax obtained from each patient (in case of a patient with multiple lesions we considered the one with greater SUV max). RESULT(S): Out of 22 patients enrolled, 5 (22.7%) negative results at both PET and CT. In the 17 positive cases (77.3%) PET overall showed 26 areas of focal uptake divided as follow: 3 in pancreatic bed, 9 hepatic, 2 pulmonary, 9 nodal (7 sub diaphragmatic, 2 supra diaphragmatic) and 3 peritoneal. On the other hand CT overall showed 50 areas of contrast enhancement divided as follow: 1 in pancreatic bed, 6 in bone, 19 hepatic, 5 pulmonary, 17 nodal (12 sub diaphragmatic, 5 supra diaphragmatic), 1 peritoneal and 1 in adrenal gland. From the comparison between CA19.9 and SUVmax obtained for each patients, in 12 out of 17 positive PET cases we observed a statistically significant correlation (p<0, 05) between CA 19.9 trend and SUVmax. Five patients (22, 7%) with positive PET showed a not significant correlation between CA19.9 and SUVmax trend. The five cases with negative both PET and CT showed lower CA 19.9 levels than patients with positive PET. CONCLUSION(S): In patients with suspected pancreatic adeno-carcinoma relapse after surgery, PET reliably detected local and peritoneal recurrences, whereas CT seemed to be more sensitive for the detection of hepatic, bone, nodal and lung metastases. Although less reliable in the identification of lymph nodes, PET is able to clearly highlight mediastinal lymph nodes. Furthermore, PET does not appear to be advantageous for the detection of non locoregional and extra-abdominal recurrences. Our experience showed a significant direct correlation between CA 19.9 increase and SUVmax. Negative PET and CT cases with positive CA19.9 are probably due to the small size of recurrent disease. To confirm our data an improvement in casuistry is required.",Excluded

BACKGROUND: To analyze the rate of larynx preservation in patients of locally advanced hypopharyngeal cancer treated with intensity modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) plus concurrent chemotherapy, and compare the results with patients treated with primary surgery., METHODS: Between January 2003 and November 2007, 14 patients were treated with primary surgery and 33 patients were treated with concurrent chemoradiotherapy (CCRT) using IMRT technique. Survival rate, larynx preservation rate were calculated with the Kaplan-Meier method. Multivariate analysis was conducted for significant prognostic factors with Cox-regression method., RESULTS: The median follow-up was 19.4 months for all patients, and 25.8 months for those alive. The 5-year overall survival rate was 33% and 44% for primary surgery and definitive CCRT, respectively (p = 0.788). The 5-year functional larynx-preservation survival after IMRT was 40%. Acute toxicities were common, but usually tolerable. The rates of treatment-related mucositis (> or = grade 2) and pharyngitis (> or = grade 3) were higher in the CCRT group. For multivariate analysis, treatment response and cricoid cartilage invasion strongly correlated with survival., CONCLUSIONS: IMRT plus concurrent chemotherapy may preserve the larynx without compromising survival.

1842,"Multifraction radiotherapy for palliation of painful bone metastases: 20 Gy versus 30 Gy. Aims and Background: To compare 2 multifraction radiotherapy schedules in the palliation of painful bone metastases. Methods and Study design: We retrospectively analyzed clinical data of 105 patients with a total of 140 painful bone metastases who were treated with 20 Gy in 5 fractions or 30 Gy in 10 fractions. The primary tumors were breast (30%), lung (28%), and prostate (14%). The main sites of irradiation were spine (n = 79) and sacrum or pelvis (n = 39). Pain was graded by patients according to the pain numeric rating scale just before and 1 month after radiotherapy. Pain progression was defined as an increase .2 on pain scale after an initial response. Result(s): The overall response rate at 1 month was 88.6%. Overall response rate was 89.6% in the 20-Gy arm and 87.3% in the 30-Gy arm (p = 0.669). The rate of complete response was statistically better in patients treated with 30 Gy (p = 0.019). The mean reduction in pain was 3.2 in the 20-Gy group and 3.6 in the 30-Gy group. Pain progression was 6.5% and 1.6%, respectively. The incidence of acute toxicity was statistically significantly higher in the 30-Gy arm (23.8%) than in the 20-Gy arm (2.6%) (p = 0.001). One pathologic fracture of the irradiated bone was observed in the 30-Gy arm. Two lesions, one in each group, were re-irradiated for pain recurrence. Pain progression was found in 6.5% of the irradiated lesions in the 20-Gy arm and in 1.6% in the 30-Gy arm. Conclusion(s): In our series, both regimens achieved high rate of pain relief, although the group treated with higher total dose reported better complete response rate.

AIM:18F-fluoro-2-deoxyglucose positron emission tomography/computed tomography (FDG- PET/CT) is widely used for initial staging and follow-up in patients with malignant lymphoma. In this study, we evaluated the efficiency of FDG-PET/CT in staging gastric lymphoma. MATERIAL- METHODS: A total of 33 patients with histological diagnosis of gastric lymphoma were referred to our clinic and scanned with FDG-PET following standard procedures. 15 out of 33 were male and 18 female. The mean age was 52,8 +/-15,7 years (range 26-80 years). Histopathologic diagnosis of gastric lymphoma was detected generally by endoscopy and revealed diffuse large B-cell lymphomas (DLBCL) (n:16), marginal zone B-cell lymphomas of mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT lymphomas) (n:5),and B cell high grade lymphomas(BCHGL) (n:12). RESULT(S): In 8 out of 33 patients the result of FDG-PET/CT was normal (5 patients had total/subtotal gastrectomy, 3 patients was MALT lymphoma). In 6 patients diffuse increased uptake in gastric wall, in 7 patients both gastric and supra-infradiaphragmatic nodal increased uptake, in 7 patients both gastric and infradiaphragmatic nodal increased uptake, in 2 patients both gastric and supradiaphragmatic nodal increased uptake. Out of 3 patients who were operated, 1 patient had infradiafragmatic lymphadenopathy, and 2 had supra-infradiafragmatik lymphadenopathy. FDG-PET/CT detected extranodal involvement in 15 patients. In our study, 3 patients with primary gastric MALT lymphoma had a negative FDG-PET/CT scan and 2 had low SUV. Thus, although the diagnostic value of FDG-PET/CT scans for primary gastric MALT lymphoma is less than that for DLBCL or, BCHGL, it might be a better imaging option than CT scans. Post treatment FDG-PET/CT was applied to 16 patients. 5 patients had progression and 11 had regression of gastric lymphoma after treatment. Among 8 patients who had normal result in previous FDG- PET/CT, progression was observed in 2. CONCLUSION(S): Whole-body FDG-PET/CT is highly sensitive in detecting gastric lesions and supra/infradiaphragmatic nodal and extranodal involvement, with the exception of primary gastric MALT lymphoma in which the FDG-PET/CT scan SUV value is low.",Excluded

997,"[Value of Radiation Therapy Oncology Group guidelines based on MR imaging in diagnosing lymph node metastasis of nasopharyngeal carcinoma]. BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Radiation Therapy Oncology Group (RTOG) and other major cooperative groups endorse the consensus guidelines for the delineation of the node levels in stage N0 cases. But it is unclear if these guidelines can be extrapolated to N+ cases. This study was to explore the value of RTOG guidelines in delineating cervical target volumes for nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) patients with lymph node metastasis., METHODS: Conventional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the nasopharynx, including plain and contrast enhanced sequences, was performed on 254 naive NPC patients. The lymph nodes were divided into six cervical levels plus retropharyngeal nodes (RN) according to RTOG guidelines proposed in 2003., RESULTS: Anatomic boundaries of node levels were observed clearly on MRI. Of the 254 patients, 107 (42.1%) had obvious lymph node necrosis, 78 (30.7%) had extracapsular nodal spread, four (1.6%) had skipped metastasis. The levels of lymph node metastases in 51 (20.1%) patients were beyond RTOG guidelines, 42 of which were above cranial level IIb, six were behind the anterior edge of the trapezius muscle, and 23 were below the caudal of level IV; 20 patients had two regions of lymph node metastases beyond RTOG guidelines. No patient only with lymph node metastasis beyond RTOG guidelines was found., CONCLUSIONS: MRI is feasible to diagnose cervical node metastasis with RTOG guidelines. The boundaries of node levels should be enlarged rationally when delineating target volumes for the N+ NPC patients according to RTOG guidelines.",Excluded
2021,"Application of CareDose 4D combined with Karl 3D technology in the low dose computed tomography for the follow-up of COVID-19. BACKGROUND: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a highly infectious disease caused by the new coronavirus. Previous studies have shown that the chest CT examination plays an important role in the diagnosis and monitoring of COVID-19. However, some patients with COVID-19 had low white blood cell counts and reduced lymphocyte ratios. Multiple CT examinations may cause radiation damages as well as increase the apoptosis of peripheral blood lymphocytes. A new low-dose CT method should be developed because the regular CT may aggravate the disease. METHOD(S): Sixty cases were randomly divided into the study group (n=30) and control group (n=30). The lung window was reconstructed by Karl 3D iterative technique in the study group. The image quality was subjectively evaluated by two senior chest group diagnostic physicians using a 5-point double-blind method. The value of CT measurement and its standard deviation (SD) was used as an objective evaluation criteria. The volume of CT dose index (CTDIvol), dose length product (DLP) and effective dose (ED) from the two groups were compared and analyzed statistically. RESULT(S): There was no significant difference in the occurrence rates of ground glass opacities, consolidation, crazy-paving pattern, fiber cable shadow and axial interstitial thickening between the study group and control group (p >0.05). In addition, no significant difference was found for the subjective score of overall image quality and image noise level (SD) between the two groups (p > 0.05). However, significant differences was found in CTDIvol, DLP, and ED between the study group and the control group (p<0.05). The effective dose of the study group was reduced by 76% compared to the control group. CONCLUSION(S): CareDose 4D low-dose scanning combined with Karl 3D iterative reconstruction technology can not only greatly reduce the radiation dose, but also provide images that meet the diagnostic criteria of COVID-19, which can be used as a routine method for the follow-up of COVID-19 patients.",Excluded
1833,"Multivariate analysis of low-dose radiation-associated changes in cytokine gene expression profiles using microarray technology. OBJECTIVE: The availability of microarray technology, which permits evaluation of the entire cellular transcriptome in a single experiment, has provided new insights on the function of the genome under normal and pathological conditions, as well as in response to genotoxic stimuli, including ionizing radiation. The aims of this study were to: 1) determine whether specific cytokine gene expression profiles can be delineated in individuals exposed to chronic, low-dose radiation; and 2) compare analyses from three multivariate analytic methodologies, hierarchical clustering analysis (HCA), principal component analysis (PCA), and projection pursuit (PP), in evaluating transcriptional responses in human mononuclear cells to low doses of ionizing radiation (IR), as determined by cDNA microarrays., MATERIALS AND METHODS: Total RNA isolated from mononuclear cells of 19 apparently healthy adult individuals exposed to low doses of IR ranging from 0.18 mSv to 49 mSv over a period of 11 to 13 years, as a result of the Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant catastrophe, was reverse transcribed in the presence of radioactive dATP to generate radiolabeled complementary cDNA. Target cDNA was hybridized to human cytokine and receptor arrays and mRNA transcriptional patterns were evaluated using HCA, PCA, and PP., RESULTS: Statistical analyses of the data generated from 19 microarrays revealed distinct gene expression patterns in mononuclear cells of individuals exposed to radiation doses of greater than 10 mSv or less than 10 mSv. Genes encompassed within clusters discerned by HCA, PCA, and PP varied depending on the methodology used to analyze the microarray data. The most frequently expressed genes across all radiation doses were serine/threonine protein kinase receptor (11/19), transforming growth factor (TGF) receptor (11/19), EB13 (10/19), and CD40 ligand., CONCLUSIONS: Although our findings suggest that it may be possible to assign gene expression profiles to low-dose-irradiated individuals, we show that gene expression profiles vary, depending on the statistical method used to analyze the data. Since there is, as of yet, no consensus regarding the best method to analyze a multivariate dataset, and since discarding the raw data and repeating the experiment at a later date constitutes an unwarranted expenditure, it is important to submit microarray data to public databases where these data can be reevaluated and interpreted by investigators holding expertise in various fields within the scientific community, including radiation biology, statistics, and bioinformatics.",Excluded
2986,"Survival in small cell lung cancer in India: Prognostic utility of clinical features, laboratory parameters and response to treatment. BACKGROUND: Predictors of survival and response to treatment in patients with small cell lung cancer (SCLC) are ill-defined and unclear. In an attempt to assess the impact of common presenting symptoms and laboratory values on survival, we undertook this retrospective review of patients with SCLC. To our knowledge, there is no study on survival in SCLC patients from the Indian subcontinent. DESIGN: Retrospective Cohort study. MATERIALS AND METHODS: All newly diagnosed small cell lung cancer cases from December 2001 through December 2004, were identified and clinical data on presenting symptoms and laboratory findings from their hospital records, noted. The influence of various pretreatment factors on survival was investigated using Kaplan-Meier plots and Cox multivariate regression model. RESULT(S): 76 subjects were included (84% males, 91% smokers). 57% patients had five or more symptoms at presentation. Cumulative symptom burden was strongly associated with survival ( P =0.02). Survival was also significantly related with Karnofsky performance status (KPS) ( P =0.04), disease extent (P =0.03) and symptomatic response to treatment ( P< 0.001). Patients with higher hemoglobin ( P =0.02), serum sodium ( P =0.04) and serum globulin ( P =0.02), survived significantly longer. By multivariate regression analysis, hemoglobin, KPS and brain metastases, were significant predictors of survival ( P =0.01, P =0.02, P< 0.01 respectively). CONCLUSION(S): Cumulative symptom burden, KPS, disease extent and symptomatic assessment of improvement after treatment, are useful predictors of survival. This has important clinical implications, keeping in view, the infrastructure and cost involved in more objective tests like CT scan, for evaluation of disease extent and prognosis. These findings can provide a simple basis for predicting prognosis in small cell lung cancer, especially in developing countries like ours.",Excluded

503,"Mononuclear cell collection for extracorporeal photochemotherapy: A comparative study on the new automated spectra optia v 5.0 and the cobe spectra MNC apheresis devices. Background: Extracorporeal photochemotherapy (ECP) is a cell therapy progressively growing in the last years to treat distinct diseases (cutaneous T cell lymphoma, acute and chronic GvHD, organ transplant rejection and some autoimmune diseases) with encouraging results. Basically, ECP is performed using the off-line or the in-line method. Mononuclear cells (MNCs) collection step, especially with off-line method, is of paramount importance to obtain a leukapheresis product of good quality (high MNC concentration, low contamination of granulocytes, platelets and red blood cells-RBC) to be ultimately infused to the patient after irradiation. A good collection efficiency, in a short time, using an automated device, would be desirable, particularly when treating for a prolonged time patients suffering from complex diseases. Aim(s): To compare MNC collection efficiency, product characteristics and side effects using the semiatomated COBE Spectra vs the automated Spectra Optia (CaridianBCT) devices during ECP treatment in two different subsets of patients suffering from GvHD and Lung transplant Rejection (LtxR). Method(s): ECP was performed following our internal protocol: Two blood volumes processed, MNCs collection volume <=150 ml, duration <=150 min, hematocrit <5%. Then MNCs were diluted with saline in UV-A permeable bags (XUV 85019 Macopharma) and UV-A irradiated (Macogenic-Macopharma) in presence of 8-methoxypsoralen before reinfusion to the patient. During 3 months, 33 patients affected with GvHD (n. 20) or LtxR (n. 13), 27 males and 6 females, were enrolled to undergo MNCs collection alternatively with the semiautomated or automated device during each ECP cycle (two procedures). Overall, 100 procedures were performed. A complete blood count was performed on peripheral blood immediately before and after procedure and on the product in order to calculate MNCs efficiency, purity and platelet depletion as well as procedure time. Any side effect occurring during treatment was registered. Result(s): Results were analyzed considering P <= 0.001 as statistically significant (see Table 1 and 2). Briefly, MNC collection efficiency and purity were similar between Optia and Cobe, while product volume was significantly smaller as well as total blood volume processed when Optia was used. Similarly, Optia demonstrated to reduce platelet bag contamination and post procedure patients' platelet depletion while there was no remarkable difference in procedure lenght between the two devices. No relevant side effects were registered. Conclusion(s): Our preliminary data show that the new Spectra Optia device represents a substantial improvement in the field of automated MNC collection. It demonstrated to be safe and user-friendly. In comparison with Spectra Cobe, Optia was able to reduce either platelet product contamination (and consequently patients' platelet depletion) and the final product volume. Finally, similar MNC collection efficiency emerged 'despite a lower blood volume was processed with Optia. (Table Presented).",Excluded

OBJECTIVES: Through a survey on perception of lung cancer screening and accompanying medical radiation exposure in Korea, the present study was to investigate its current situations and evaluate various perception of physicians regarding it in order to propose measures for improvements., METHODS: Medical specialists in national cancer screening institutions selected through stratified random sampling were subjected to face-to-face interview using a structured questionnaire. We investigated physicians' perception on effectiveness of lung cancer screening depending on screening modality, selection criteria for subjects of screening, types of equipment used to screen, and perception for seriousness of adverse effects following the test. In addition, odds ratios to underestimate risk of radiation exposure from screening were calculated through logistic regression analysis., RESULTS: Each response that chest X-ray is effective for lung cancer screening and that smoking history is not considered prior to screening recommendation accounted for more than 60% of respondents, suggesting the chance of unnecessary screening tests. Regarding adverse effects of lung cancer screening, about 85% of respondents replied that false positive, radiation exposure, and overdiagnosis could be ignored. About 70% of respondents underestimated radiation dose from lung cancer screening, and a low proportion of physicians informed patients of radiation exposure risk., CONCLUSIONS: It was found that most physicians underestimated harms of lung cancer screening including radiation exposure and were lack of awareness regarding lung cancer screening. It should be noted that physicians need to have proper perceptions about screening recommendation and accompanying possible harms, for successful implementation of the screening program.",Excluded

PURPOSE: To evaluate the impact of dose reduction on the performance of computer-aided lung nodule detection systems (CAD) of two manufacturers by comparing respective CAD results on ultra-low-dose computed tomography (ULD-CT) and standard dose CT (SD-CT)., MATERIALS AND METHODS: Multi-slice computed tomography (MSCT) data sets of 26 patients (13 male and 13 female, patients 31 - 74 years old) were retrospectively selected for CAD analysis. Indication for CT examination was staging of a known primary malignancy or suspected pulmonary malignancy. CT images were consecutively acquired at 5 mAs (ULD-CT) and 75 mAs (SD-CT) with 120 kV tube voltage (1 mm slice thickness). The standard of reference was determined by three experienced readers in consensus. CAD reading algorithms (pre-commercial CAD system, Philips, Netherlands: CAD-1; LungCARE, Siemens, Germany: CAD-2) were applied to the CT data sets., RESULTS: Consensus reading identified 253 nodules on SD-CT and ULD-CT. Nodules ranged in diameter between 2 and 41 mm (mean diameter 4.8 mm). Detection rates were recorded with 72 % and 62 % (CAD-1 vs. CAD-2) for SD-CT and with 73 % and 56 % for ULD-CT. Median false positive rates per patient were calculated with 6 and 5 (CAD-1 vs. CAD-2) for SD-CT and with 8 and 3 for ULD-CT. After separate statistical analysis of nodules with diameters of 5 mm and greater, the detection rates increased to 83 % and 61 % for SD-CT and to 89 % and 67 % for ULD-CT (CAD-1 vs. CAD-2). For both CAD systems there were no significant differences between the detection rates for standard and ultra-low-dose data sets (p > 0.05)., CONCLUSION: Dose reduction of the underlying CT scan did not significantly influence nodule detection performance of the tested CAD systems.",Excluded
1730,"Increased risk for vertebral fractures with long-term observation in mild primary hyperparathyroidism: Five year data from the scandinavian investigation of primary hyperparathyroidism (SIPH). Introduction Cohort studies using surrogate endpoints suggest decreased fracture risk after parathyroidectomy in patients with asymptomatic primary hyperparathyroidism (PHPT), but long-term prospective studies are lacking. Here we report 5 year data on bone mineral density (BMD) and vertebral fracture (VF) incidence from the SIPH study1, where patients with PHPT were randomized to either parathyroidectomy (PTX) or observation (OBS). Methods Data were available from 130 patients (OBS n= 67, PTX n= 63) 5 years after randomization (mean age at inclusion 62 years, 9 men in each group). Baseline biochemistry (total Calcium (Ca), Parathyroid hormone (PTH), Creatinine) and BMD Z-scores by DXA (Z) for lumbar spine (LS) and femoral neck (FN) were similar in the two groups. Lateral radiographs of the thoracolumbar spine were obtained at baseline, and after 2 and 5 years. Two radiologists, blinded to randomization and clinical data, evaluated the radiographs in consensus, using the semiquantitative method of Genant2 (including also L5). Results Basic biochemistry was stable in the OBS group, and normalized after parathyroidectomy (P< 0.001 for Ca and PTH). For the OBS group, baseline BMD Z in LS was -0.3 (IQR: -1.25 to +1.0) and in FN-0.2 (IQR: -0.9 to +0.5). After 5 years BMD Z in LS was-0.2 (IQR: -1.2 to +0.6) and in FN -0.6 (IQR: -1.0 to +0.1); not significant for both sites. For the PTX group, baseline BMD Z in LS was -0.2 (IQR: -1.0 to +1.0) and in FN -0.3 (IQR: 1.0 to +0.3). After 5 years BMD Z in LS increased to +0.4 (IQR: -0.7 to +1.2) and in FN to -0.2 (IQR: -0.7 to +0.4); P< 0.01 for both sites. The change in Z-scores (LS; FN) was different between OBS and PTX (P=0.04; P=0.013). At 5 years, X-rays were available for 110 patients (15 men) with baseline radiographs and at least one follow-up radiograph. Fifty-six patients were randomized to OBS (6 men) and 54 to PTX (9 men). Total follow-up time was 267.9 years (mean 4.8 years) in the OBS group and 271.5 years (mean 5.0 years) in the PTX group. There were 12 VFs in 10 patients (all women; 9.1% of all patients) at baseline (4 OBS patients with 6 VFs, 6 PTX patients with 6 VFs). During follow-up, 5 new VFs occurred in 5 patients (women), exclusively in the OBS group. Thus, 8.9% of the patients randomized to OBS, and none in the PTX group (P= 0.029), developed a new VF. Four of the new VFs occurred in patients with no VFs at baseline. All new VFs were of mild to moderate degree, and none had symptoms that could be related to the VF. Conclusion Five years after randomization, biochemistry and BMD Z-scores were stable with observation. Following parathyroidectomy biochemistry normalized and BMD Z-scores increased.

2432,"A comparison between unilateral transverse process-pedicle and bilateral puncture techniques in percutaneous kyphoplasty. Study Design. A prospective comparative study. Objective. To assess the clinical and radiological outcomes for the treatment of osteoporotic vertebral compression fractures using unilateral transverse process-pedicle and bilateral percutaneous kyphoplasty (PKP). Summary of Background Data. PKP is a widely used vertebral augmentation procedure for treating painful vertebral compression fractures. A percutaneous bilateral approach is typically used to access the vertebral body. Many previous studies have reported excellent clinical results with PKP. In contrast, numerous complications and problems have also been reported, such as puncture diffi culty, cement leakage, and adjacent vertebral fracture. Methods. This prospective study included 316 patients with singlelevel lumbar osteoporotic vertebral compression fracture, 224 females and 92 males with a mean age of 71.5 years. Randomized patients underwent PKP using 2 different puncture techniques. The patients were followed up postoperatively and were assessed mainly with regard to clinical and radiological outcomes. Clinical outcomes were evaluated mainly using the visual analogue scale for pain and 36- Item Short Form Health Survey (SF-36) questionnaire for health status. Radiological outcomes were assessed mainly on the basis of radiation dose, bone cement distribution, vertebral body height, and kyphotic angle. Results. Patients were followed up from 12 to 28 months, with an average of 16.8 months. One hundred fi fty-eight patients were treated with unilateral method and 151 patients were treated with bilateral method. In the unilateral group, the volume of the injected cement and radiation dose were signifi cantly less than that in the bilateral group. All patients in both groups had signifi cantly less pain after the procedures, compared with their preoperative period pain. No statistically signifi cant differences were observed when visual analogue scale and 36-Item Short Form Health Survey were compared between the groups. Both unilateral and bilateral groups showed insignifi cant decrease in the kyphotic angle during the follow-ups. The kyphotic angle in the unilateral group improved more signifi cantly than in the bilateral group. In the bilateral group, 16 patients had obvious pain in the puncture sites at 1 month postoperatively caused by facet joint violation. With local block treatment, the pain disappeared in all patients at the last follow-up. Conclusion. Both bilateral and unilateral PKP are relatively safe and provide effective treatment for patients with painful osteoporotic vertebral compression fracture. However, unilateral PKP received less radiation dose and operation time, it also offered a higher degree of deformity correction and resulted in less complication than bilateral PKP.Copyright © 2014 Lippincott Williams & Wilkins.",Excluded

PURPOSE: To study the clinical characteristics and course of a cohort of patients presenting with pelvic ring fragility fractures(PFF). METHOD(S): A retrospective chart review of 43 patients with PFF seen over a 4 year period in a community based outpatient fracture clinic was conducted. A complete history and physical, review of medical records and x-rays, CBC, chemistry profile, TSH, urinalysis, vitamin B12, 25-OH vitamin D, PTH, and immunofixation(IMF) was done in all patients. Antiparietal cell(APA) and intrinsic factor(IF) antibody and SPE was done in select cases. Comorbidity including history of solid tumor, diabetes, COPD, cardiac and neurologic disorder were tabulated. RESULT(S): There were 38 females and 5 males ranging in age 55-95 years(mean 82.3). 23 patients had a previous major osteoporotic fracture and 8 a total hip replacement. 17 had received previous osteoporosis treatment. 40 patients were living at home and 22 were still driving within 3 months prior to the fall causing the PFF. 13 were using ambulatory aids. Patients had 0-3(mean 0.93) comorbid conditions: COPD-11, cardiac-11, cancer-7, neurologic-6, and diabetes-5. 2 patients had previous radiation therapy to the pelvic area. The BMI was 20< in 9 patients and 19 had peripheral neuropathy(PN). CT or MRI confirmed the PFF in 37 patients and showed fractures of the sacrum-17, acetabulum-7, and both sacrum and acetabulum-5 in addition to the pelvic rami. Monoclonal protein was found with IMF in 17(42%) patients: IgG-7, IgG-6, and light chains-4. M-spike was found in 8. 5(14%) patients had low vitamin B12 and either APA or IF. 3 patients had vitamin D levels 20<ng/ml and 7 had hyponatremia. Alkaline phosphatase was elevated in 12 patients. 29 patients required rehabilitation in a nursing home. During follow up (mean 20.7 months) 12(31%) patients died,10 within 1 year after PFF from causes unrelated to the fracture. CONCLUSION(S): PFF occurs predominantly in female, elderly, independent and active patients with few comorbid conditions and is associated with significant morbidity. PFF may be a prelude to mortality within 1 year of occurrence. CT or MRI scans are necessary to define the full extent of injury to the pelvis. Although the clinical characteristics may differ between PFF, hip, and vertebral fracture patients, they all share age related conditions such as low BMI, PN, MGUS, pernicious anemia and hyponatremia that predispose to falling and bone fragility.",Excluded
2321,"Perfusion MRI detects rCBF abnormalities in early stages of HIV-cognitive motor complex. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate patients with early HIV-cognitive motor complex (HIV-CMC) for possible regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) abnormalities on perfusion MRI (pMRI)., BACKGROUND: Nuclear medicine techniques have demonstrated global and focal cerebral perfusion abnormalities in patients with HIV dementia. Ultrafast pMRI enables the measurement of rCBF throughout the brain without the need to apply radioactive tracers or ionizing radiation., METHODS: pMRI was used to measure the rCBF in 19 patients with early stages of HIV-CMC and 15 healthy seronegative control subjects. The rCBF maps were registered to high-resolution anatomic MRI scans and transformed into Talairach space. Statistical analysis of the rCBF maps was performed with SPM96., RESULTS: Compared with the control subjects, the patients with HIV had statistically significantly decreased rCBF bilaterally in the inferior lateral frontal cortices (right: -15%, p < 0.002; left: -12%, p < 0.005) and in the inferior medial parietal brain region (-15%, p < 0.0009). In contrast, rCBF was increased bilaterally in the posterior inferior parietal white matter (right: +19%, p < 0.0001; left: + 17%, p < 0.001). Furthermore, rCBF abnormalities correlated significantly with clinical disease severity as measured by CD4 count, plasma viral load, Karnofsky score, and HIV dementia scale., DISCUSSION: Our results are consistent with previous findings from PET and SPECT studies. Furthermore, pMRI can detect rCBF abnormalities that correlate with disease severity in HIV-CMC. Because pMRI is more cost-effective, faster, and safer than nuclear medicine techniques for monitoring rCBF changes, pMRI may be more feasible for monitoring the effects of therapy for HIV-CMC.",Excluded

This study intends to evaluate radiation doses and estimated risk from angiographic projections during CA procedure performed using novel flat detector (FD) system with improved image processing and noise reduction techniques. Real-time monitoring of radiation doses using kerma-area product (KAP) meter was performed for 140 patients using Philips Clarity FD system. The CA procedure involved seven standard projections, of which five were extensively selected by interventionalists. Mean fluoroscopic time (FT), KAP, and reference air kerma (Ka,r) for CA procedure were 3.24 min (0.5-10.51), 13.99Gycm2 (4.02-37.6), and 231.43 mGy (73.8-622.15), respectively. Effective dose calculated using Monte Carlo-based PCXMC software was found to be 4.9mSv. Left anterior oblique (LAO) 45degree projection contributed the highest radiation dose (28%) of the overall KAP. Radiation-induced risk was found to be higher in females compared to males with increased risk of lung cancer. An increase of 10%-15% in radiation dose was observed when one or more additional projections were adopted along with the seven standard projections. A 14% reduction of radiation dose was achieved from novel FD system when low-dose protocol during fluoroscopy and medium-dose protocol during cine acquisitions were adopted, compared to medium-dose protocol.",Excluded

Some of them indicate a lower effectiveness of recanalisation of the circumflex artery (Cx). Methods and Results: Between January 2011 and February 2015, 252 CTO procedures in 242 patients were performed. Characteristics of the occlusions, the procedures performed and the effectiveness of revascularisation among various coronary arteries were compared. In the study group, most of the patients were men - 201 (83.1%) - and 41 (16.9%) were women. The average age was 62.4+/-9.3 years. The incidence of the risk factors was: hypertension - 86.8% (n=211), hypercholesterolaemia - 99.1% (n=241), diabetes - 29.2% (n=71), smoking - 20.6% (n=50) and history of smoking - 58.0% (n=141). The artery most often opened was the right coronary artery (RCA) - 49.0% (n=125), followed by the left anterior descending (LAD) 32.9% (n=84) and the circumflex branch 18.1% (n=46). There were no differences in the duration of the occlusions among subsequent arteries. There was a difference in length of occlusion (mm): RCA - 30.5+/-13.5, LAD - 25.5+/-9.9, Cx - 20.2+/-8.3 (p<0.05 for all changes). J-CTO score for each coronary artery was as follows: 0 - 10.9% LAD (n=9) 23.9% Cx (n=11), 11.0% RCA (n=14); 1 - 31.7% LAD (n=26), 45.6% Cx (n=21), 22.8% RCA (n=29); 2 - LAD 37.8% (n=31), 19.6% Cx (n=9), 38.5% RCA (n=49); >=3 - LAD 19.5% (n=16), 10.9% Cx (n=5), 27.5% RCA (n=34). Mean J-CTO score for LAD was 2.19+/-0.95, for Cx 2.13+/-1.14, and for RCA 2.29+/-1.07 (p=NS between arteries). The longest procedure time of the revascularisation was PCI of the RCA (77.1+/-34.9 min, p<0.05 relative to the remaining vessels). Procedure time between the LAD (65.9+/-28.8 min) and the Cx (56.6+/-26 8 min) did not differ significantly. Fluoroscopy time was also the longest during PCI of the RCA (31.0+/-19.2 min, p<0.005 relative to other arteries), and did not differ between Cx (20.0+/-12.2 min) and LAD (25.3+/-16.8 min). There was no difference in the radiation dose (Gy): 2.5+/-1.7 vs. 2.2+/-1.3 vs. 2.5+/-1.3 (RCA, Cx and LAD, respectively) among vessels. The volume of contrast was similar during PCI of the RCA and LAD (365.8+/-161.6 vs. 371.3+/-149.4 mL, p=NS) and was significantly higher in comparison to PCI of the Cx (279.6+/-150.9 mL). The reverse technique (retrograde) was used most frequently during PCI of the RCA (30.4%, n=38), then LAD (19.1%, n=16) and significantly less during PCI of the Cx (4.4%, n=2). The number of implanted stents was significantly higher in PCI of the RCA (1.9+/-0.8) and did not differ between the LAD (1.3+/-0.6) and Cx (1.1+/-0.4). There was no difference in the incidence of complications depending on the artery opened: there was 1 stroke and 1 myocardial infarction during PCI of the RCA and 2 smaller perforations during PCI of the LAD and Cx. One tamponade was observed during PCI of the RCA. Efficacy of recanalisation was similar for all of the arteries: 82.4% for the RCA (n=103), 84.5% for the LAD (n=71), and 91.3% for the Cx (n=46). Conclusion(s): The most common artery we revascularised was the right coronary artery. It was characterised by the longest length of occlusion and required the longest procedure time and fluoroscopy time. Furthermore, it required the highest amount of contrast medium and number of implanted stents. Nevertheless, the efficacy was similar for all vessels.",Excluded
3124,"Systemic radionuclide therapy in pain palliation. Several radiopharmaceuticals were investigated to determine their efficacy and toxicity in the palliation of painful bone metastases. Data on the influence of rhenium-188 hydroxyethylidene diphosphonate (188Re-HEDP), rhenium-186 hydroxyethylidene diphosphonate (186Re-HEDP), and strontium-89 (89Sr) on pain symptoms, quality of life, and bone-marrow function were obtained in 64 patients with breast and prostate cancer. Thirty-one patients were treated with 188Re-HEDP (3194 +/- 387 MBq), 15 patients with 186Re-HEDP (1358 +/- 158 MBq), and 18 patients with 89Sr (152 +/- 19 MBq). The 188Re-HEDP group included six breast cancer patients and 25 prostate cancer patients; the 186Re-HEDP group included three breast cancer patients and 12 prostate cancer patients; and the 89Sr group included three breast cancer patients and 15 prostate cancer patients. All subjects participated in an interview using a standardized sets of questions before and after the 12-week term of therapy. Blood counts were taken weekly for six weeks and after 12 weeks. Results showed that 77 percent of patients reported pain relief after treatment with 188Re-HEDP, 67 percent after treatment with 186Re-HEDP, and 72 percent after treatment with 89Sr. Sixteen percent of patients treated with 188Re-HEDP, 13 percent treated with 186Re-HEDP, and 17 percent treated with 89Sr were able to discontinue their analgesics and were pain-free. Patients described an improvement on Karnofsky performance status (KPS) from 73 +/- 7 percent to 85 +/- 8 percent 12 weeks after 188Re-HEDP (p < 0. 05), from 72 +/- 13 percent to 79 +/- 12 percent after 186Re-HEDP (p = 0.251), and from 62 +/- 14 percent to 69 +/- 16 percent after 89Sr (p = 0.415). Only three patients undergoing 188Re-HEDP therapy, one undergoing 186Re-HEDP therapy, and three undergoing 89Sr therapy had thrombocytopenia (platelet count below 100 x 10(3)/microl) following treatment. The maximum nadir of platelet and leukocyte counts was observed between the second and fifth week after treatment for all radionuclides and was reversible within 12 weeks. The nadir was earlier for 188Re-HEDP with a shorter physical half-life compared with 89Sr. There were no significant differences in bone marrow toxicity (p = 0.123-0.421). Results of this study indicate that all evaluated radiopharmaceuticals were effective in pain palliation without induction of severe side effects. The increase in KPS after 188Re-HEDP was the only statistically significant finding (p = 0.001).",Excluded
3383,"Iodine isotope (131I) therapy for toxic nodular goitre: Treatment efficacy parameters. BACKGROUND: When planning radioactive iodine therapy, it frequently happens, both in Poland and world-wide, that inadequate attention is paid to such easily measurable parameters as: 1) the serum concentration of thyrotropin (TSH) before administering radioiodine, which is a key factor for extranodular (non-autonomous) iodine uptake of the thyroid gland, 2) thyroid gland iodine uptake, and 3) the effective half-life of 131I (Teff.). The aim of the study is to evaluate the impact of the above factors on the efficacy of 131I treatment in hyperthyroid patients. METHOD(S): The material consisted of 4140 patients: 2190 with autonomous toxic nodules (ATN) and 1950 with toxic multinodular goitres (TMG). The patients were prepared for treatment in such away that the concentration of TSH did not exceed 0.1 mU/I and Teff. < 5 days. The therapeutic activity of 131I was calculated using Marinelli's formula. The selection of absorbed dose value was determined by the degree of suppression of extranodular tissue. Monitoring was performed every eight weeks. RESULT(S): At one year after 131I administration showed that a euthyroid status was achieved in 94%, hypothyroidism was seen observed in 3%, while persistence or recurrence of hyperthyroidism in 3% of ATN patients and, respectively, 89%, 4% and 7% of TMG patients. CONCLUSION(S): Patients with toxic nodular goitre who are to be treated with radioiodine should have the lowest possible serum concentration of TSH. The suppression of extranodular deter- mines the optimal value of absorbed dose for Marinelli's formula. Copyright © 2012 Via Medica.",Excluded
2392,"Long-Term, Prospective Performance of the MD Anderson Dysphagia Inventory in ""Low-Intermediate Risk"" Oropharyngeal Carcinoma After Intensity Modulated Radiation Therapy. PURPOSE: To characterize long-term MD Anderson Dysphagia Inventory (MDADI) results after primary intensity modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) for oropharyngeal carcinoma (OPC) among patients with ""low-intermediate risk"" OPC who would be eligible for current trials (eg, ECOG 3311, NRG HN002, CRUK PATHOS)., METHODS AND MATERIALS: A retrospective pooled analysis combined data from 3 single-institution clinical trials for advanced-stage head and neck carcinoma. Inclusion criteria were clinical stage III/IV OPC (T1-2/N1-2b, T3/N0-2b) treated with definitive split-field IMRT and prospectively collected MDADI at baseline and at least 1 posttreatment interval available in trial databases. Patients were sampled to represent likely human papillomavirus (HPV)-associated disease (HPV+/p16+ or <10 pack-years if HPV/p16 unknown). The MDADI composite scores were collected at baseline and 6, 12, and 24 months after treatment. Pairwise tests were Bonferroni corrected for multiple comparisons., RESULTS: Forty-six patients were included. All received bilateral neck irradiation with a median dose of 70 Gy and systemic therapy (57% concurrent, 43% induction only). Overall the mean baseline MDADI composite score was 90.1, dropping to 74.6 at 6 months (P<.0001) and rising to 78.5 (P<.0001) and 83.1 (P=.002) by 12 and 24 months relative to baseline, respectively, representing a clinically meaningful drop in MDADI scores at 6 months that partially recovers by 24 months (6 vs 24 months, P=.05). Poor MDADI scores (composite <60) were reported in 4%, 11%, 15%, and 9% of patients at baseline and 6, 12, and 24 months, respectively. Fifteen percent of patients had a persistently depressed composite score by at least 20 points at the 24-month interval., CONCLUSION: ""Low-intermediate risk"" patients with OPC treated with laryngeal/esophageal inlet dose-optimized split-field IMRT are highly likely to report recovery of acceptable swallowing function in long-term follow-up. Only 15% report poor swallowing function and/or persistently depressed MDADI at 12 months or more after IMRT. These data serve as a benchmark future trial design and endpoint interpretation.

2783,"Drivers for Sun Protection in Black South Africans. Sun protection behavior studies are almost exclusively carried out in populations with fair skin for the obvious reason that people with unpigmented skin are more susceptible to the health impacts of excess solar ultraviolet radiation exposure. In a dataset of 1271 Black South Africans, we analyzed factors related to sun protection applied when spending time outdoors including awareness of skin cancer, gender, age and Living Standards Measure (LSM) where 1-4 equate to the lowest, 5-7 intermediate and 8-10 the highest LSM status. The most important driver for Black South Africans to use sun protection was whether they were aware of skin cancer (OR: 2.6 for those who were aware versus those who were not, P < 0.0001). Sunscreen was preferred by respondents in LSM 8-10 whereas people in the lowest group (LSM 1-4) favored shade, umbrellas and hats. One in two respondents claimed to use some form of sun protection, which appears to be higher than deeply pigmented populations in other countries.Copyright © 2019 American Society for Photobiology.",Excluded
2278,"Therapeutic applications of PARP inhibitors: Anticancer therapy and beyond. The aim of this article is to describe the current and potential clinical translation of pharmacological inhibitors of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) for the therapy of various diseases. The first section of the present review summarizes the available preclinical and clinical data with PARP inhibitors in various forms of cancer. In this context, the role of PARP in single-strand DNA break repair is relevant, leading to replication-associated lesions that cannot be repaired if homologous recombination repair (HRR) is defective, and the synthetic lethality of PARP inhibitors in HRR-defective cancer. HRR defects are classically associated with BRCA1 and 2 mutations associated with familial breast and ovarian cancer, but there may be many other causes of HRR defects. Thus, PARP inhibitors may be the drugs of choice for BRCA mutant breast and ovarian cancers, and extend beyond these tumors if appropriate biomarkers can be developed to identify HRR defects. Multiple lines of preclinical data demonstrate that PARP inhibition increases cytotoxicity and tumor growth delay in combination with temozolomide, topoisomerase inhibitors and ionizing radiation. Both single agent and combination clinical trials are underway. The final part of the first section of the present review summarizes the current status of the various PARP inhibitors that are in various stages of clinical development. The second section of the present review summarizes the role of PARP in selected non-oncologic indications. In a number of severe, acute diseases (such as stroke, neurotrauma, circulatory shock and acute myocardial infarction) the clinical translatability of PARP inhibition is supported by multiple lines of preclinical data, as well as observational data demonstrating PARP activation in human tissue samples. In these disease indications, PARP overactivation due to oxidative and nitrative stress drives cell necrosis and pro-inflammatory gene expression, which contributes to disease pathology. Accordingly, multiple lines of preclinical data indicate the efficacy of PARP inhibitors to preserve viable tissue and to down-regulate inflammatory responses. As the clinical trials with PARP inhibitors in various forms of cancer progress, it is hoped that a second line of clinical investigations, aimed at testing of PARP inhibitors for various non-oncologic indications, will be initiated, as well. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

3570,"Reducing contrast medium dose with low photon energy images in renal dual-energy spectral CT angiography and adaptive statistical iterative reconstruction (ASIR). OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the value of using low energy (keV) images in renal dual-energy spectral CT angiography (CTA) and adaptive statistical iterative reconstruction (ASIR) to reduce contrast medium dose. METHOD(S): 40 patients with renal CTA on a Discovery CT750HD were randomly divided into two groups: 20 cases (Group A) with 600mgI kg-1 and 20 cases (Group B) with 300mgI kg-1. The scan protocol for both groups was: dual-energy mode with mA selection for noise index of 10 HU, pitch 1.375:1, rotating speed 0.6s/r. Images were reconstructed at 0.625mm thickness with 40%ASIR, Group A used the conventional 70keV monochromatic images, and Group B used monochromatic images from 40 to 70 keV at 5 keV interval for analysis. The CT values and standard deviation (SD) values of the renal artery and erector spine in the plain and arterial phases were measured with the erector spine SD value representing image noise. The enhancement degree of the renal artery (DELTACT = CT(arterial) -CT(plain)), signal-to-noise ratio (SNR=CTrenal-artery/SDrenal-artery) and contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR=(CTrenal-artery-CTerector spine)/SDerector-spine) were calculated. The single factor analysis of variance was used to analyze the difference of DELTACT, SNR and CNR among image groups with p < 0.05 being statistically significant. The subjective image scores of the groups were assessed blindly by two experienced physicians using a 5-point system and the score consistency was compared by the kappa test. RESULT(S): Contrast medium dose in the 300mgI kg-1 group was reduced by 50% compared with the 600mgI kg-1 group, while radiation dose was similar between the two groups. The subjective scores were 4.00 +/- 0.65, 4.50 +/- 0.60and 3.70 +/- 0.80 for images at 70 keV (600mgI kg-1 group), 40 keV (300mgI kg-1 group) and 45 keV (300mgI kg-1 group), respectively with good consistency between the two reviewers (p > 0.05). The 40 keV images in the 300mgI kg-1 group had similar DELTACT (469.77 +/- 86.95HU vs 398.54 +/- 73.68HU) and CNR (15.52 +/- 3.32 vs 18.78 +/- 6.71) values as the 70 keV images in the 600mgI kg-1) group but higher SNR values (30.19 +/- 4.41 vs 16.91 +/- 11.12, p < 0,05). CONCLUSION(S): Contrast dose may be reduced by 50% while maintaining image quality by using lower energy images combined with ASIR in renal dual-energy CTA. ADVANCES IN KNOWLEDGE: Combined with ASIR and energy spectrum, can reduce the amount of contrast dose in renal CTA.",Excluded
938,"Dose-dependent changes in renal (1)H-/(23)Na MRI after adjuvant radiochemotherapy for gastric cancer. PURPOSE: Combined radiochemotherapy (RCT) for gastric cancer with three-dimensional conformal radiotherapy (3D-CRT) results in ablative doses to the upper left kidney, while image-guided intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IG-IMRT) allows kidney sparing despite improved target coverage. Renal function in long-term gastric cancer survivors was evaluated with 3T functional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) including diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) and (23)Na imaging., PATIENTS AND METHODS: Five healthy volunteers and 13 patients after radiotherapy were included: 11xIG-IMRT; 1x3D-CRT; 1x positive control"" with stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) of a metastasis between the spleen/left kidney. Radiation doses were documented for the upper/middle/lower kidney subvolumes. Late toxicity was evaluated based on CTC criteria, questionnaire, and creatinine values. Morphological sequences, DWI images, and (23)Na images were acquired using a (1)H/(23)Na-tuned body-coil before/after intravenous water load (WL). Statistics for [(23)Na] (concentration) and apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) values were calculated for upper/middle/lower renal subvolumes. Corticomedullary [(23)Na] gradients and [(23)Na] differences after WL were determined., RESULTS: No major morphological alteration was detected in any patient. Minor scars were observed in the cranial subvolume of the left kidney of the 3D-CRT and the whole kidney of the control SBRT patient. All participants presented a corticomedullary [(23)Na] gradient. After WL, a significant physiological [(23)Na] gradient decrease (p < 0.001) was observed in all HV and IG-IMRT patients. In the cranial left kidney of the 3D-CRT patient and the positive control SBRT patient, the decrease was nonsignificant (p = 0.01, p = 0.02). ADC values were altered nonsignificantly in all renal subvolumes (all participants). Renal subvolumes with doses >= 35 Gy showed a reduced change of the [(23)Na] gradient after WL (p = 0.043). No participants showed clinical renal impairment., CONCLUSIONS: Functional parameters of renal (23)Na MRI after gastric IG-IMRT are identical to those of healthy volunteers, in contrast to renal subvolumes after ablative doses in the control and 3D-CRT patient. While kidney doses to the cortex below 20-25 Gy in fractional doses of ~ 1 Gy in IG-IMRT (combined with intensified chemotherapy) do not seem to cause significant MRI morphological or functional alterations, doses of > 35 Gy in 1.5-2 Gy fractions clearly result in impairment.""",Excluded
3159,"Prognostic factors and prevention of radioembolization-induced liver disease. UNLABELLED: Radioembolization (RE)-induced liver disease (REILD) has been defined as jaundice and ascites appearing 1 to 2 months after RE in the absence of tumor progression or bile duct occlusion. Our aims were to study the incidence of REILD in a large cohort of patients and the impact of a series of changes introduced in the processes of treatment design, activity calculation, and the routine use of ursodeoxycholic acid and low-dose steroids (modified protocol). Between 2003 and 2011, 260 patients with liver tumors treated by RE were studied (standard protocol: 75, modified protocol: 185). REILD appeared only in patients with cirrhosis or in noncirrhosis patients exposed to systemic chemotherapy prior to RE. Globally, the incidence of REILD was reduced in the modified protocol group from 22.7% to 5.4% and the incidence of severe REILD from 13.3% to 2.2% (P<0.0001). Treatment efficacy was not jeopardized since 3-month disease control rates were virtually identical in both groups (66.7% and 67.2%, P=0.93). Exposure to chemotherapy in the 2-month period following RE and being treated by the standard protocol were independent predictors of REILD among noncirrhosis patients. In cirrhosis, the presence of a small liver (total volume<1.5 L), an abnormal bilirubin (>1.2 mg/dL), and treatment in a selective fashion were independently associated with REILD., CONCLUSION: REILD is an uncommon but relevant complication that appears when liver tissue primed by cirrhosis or prior and subsequent chemotherapy is exposed to the radiation delivered by radioactive microspheres. We designed a comprehensive treatment protocol that reduces the frequency and the severity of REILD. Copyright © 2012 American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases.",Excluded
1988,"Mandibulotomy: an analysis of its morbidities. The mandibulotomy is a procedure that was developed to improve access in tumour resection. This study aimed to investigate the complications associated with mandibulotomy and analyze factors that could affect the risks of developing these complications. The hospital records of all patients who underwent a mandibulotomy as part of their tumour ablative surgery at two major centres in Malaysia were reviewed retrospectively. Demographic, clinical, and complications data were recorded and analyzed. Early postoperative complications occurred in 46.5% of the patients and post-radiation therapy complications in 16.1%. Wound dehiscence (27.9%) and inferior alveolar nerve injury (25.6%) were the common early postoperative complications. Dental injuries (9.7%) and plate exposure/infection (9.7%) were the common post-radiation therapy complications. Furthermore, inferior alveolar nerve injury and early abscess formation were significantly associated with the site of the mandibulotomy. The T-stage of a tumour but not the site of mandibulotomy was significantly associated with tumour margin clearance. Mandibulotomy does pose an added risk of complications for a patient undergoing tumour surgery. The benefits of mandibulotomy in terms of gaining margin clearance could not be proven in this study. The site of mandibulotomy appears to increase the risk of developing an inferior alveolar nerve injury.Copyright © 2019",Excluded
1295,"Selection of comparable anatomical locations of muscle cross-sectional images in the Osteoarthritis Initiative MRI data. Purpose: Muscle forces and cross sectional areas (CSA) play an important role in the onset and progression of OA. The OA Initiative provides images of muscle CSAs of both limbs. These images are acquired starting 10 cm proximally of the distal epiphyseal line of the femur and cover 15 slices of 0.5 mm (7.5 cm) in proximal direction. The images therefore have a variable anatomical location with regard to the femur and thigh muscles in short and tall individuals, and this poses limits on the comparability between participants in cross sectional studies. The objectives were therefore to determine a) the location of the 15 slices in relation to the femur (%length) in persons with variable body height, b) which part of the femur (% length) is covered in all subjects, and c) whether the inter-subject variability of the location of these cross sectional images (versus the femoral length) can be effectively reduced, when accounting for differences in body height. Method(s): Clinical data, MR images of the thigh muscles, and full limb X-rays from 48 OA participants with calculated Kellgren Lawrence grade 3 were studied (OAI public data sets 0.2.2, 0.E.1, 1.E.1). The subjects were selected to cover the full body height distribution in men and women. In the women (n=24), the body height ranged from 151.1 to 180.2 cm, and in the men (n=24) from 162.8 to 188.8 cm. From the full-limb X-rays, the femoral length (distance of the knee joint space to the proximal end of the femoral head was determined in vertical direction. The position of the epiphyseal line (in the femur) was measured in MRI scout views which were used to plan the thigh muscle MRI acquisitions. Result(s): The femoral length (F) in the full-limb X-rays varied from 47.3 to 55.1 cm in men, and from 44.2 to 55.9 cm in women The relationship between F and the body height (H) was similar in men and women (F=29.4% of H in women [min:27.5%, max:31.5%], and F=30.0% of H in men [min: 27.9%, max:33.8%]). Linear regression analysis provided the equations F=0.29xH mm + 15.7mm for men (r2=63%) and F=0.33 x Hmm - 51.93mm for women (r2=57%) as estimates of F. The epiphyseal line was clearly visible in 24 of the 48 MRI scout views; its relative position in the femur (from distal) was 6.0% in women (min:3.4%; max:8.5%), and 7.2% in men (min:5.5%, max:8.8%), The location was significantly different (p=0.03) between sexes. From these data, it was derived that a region of 29.4% to 36.7% of the femoral length (from distal) was covered by the 15 axial MRI muscle slices in all men, and a region between 31.1% and 35.7% in all women, across the full range of body heights. Therefore a target slice located at 33% of F (from distal to proximal) was selected, so that all participants could be included in a measurement, independent of body height. This location corresponded to slice No7 (from distal to proximal) in a person of average height (=mean across the 48 subjects). When selecting slice No7 in every participant, its location varied between 30% and 37% of the femoral length (standard deviation [SD]=1.5%). When choosing the most appropriate slice after accounting for differences in body height (slice number 4 to 9), its location varied only between 32.5% and 33.5% (SD=0.3%). Conclusion(s): Measurement of the femoral length and the epiphyseal line allows for the precise selection of comparable slices for measuring muscle CSAs in subjects with different heights. In cases where no full limb radiographs are available, the use of body height (H) as an estimate of femoral length (F) can reduce the variability of the slice location as expressed by the standard deviation by a factor of 5 compared with choosing the same slice across all subjects.",Excluded

2396,"Preoperative Chemoradiotherapy Versus Immediate Surgery for Resectable and Borderline Resectable Pancreatic Cancer: Results of the Dutch Randomized Phase III PREOPANC Trial. PURPOSE Preoperative chemoradiotherapy may improve the radical resection rate for resectable or borderline resectable pancreatic cancer, but the overall benefit is unproven. PATIENTS AND METHODS In this randomized phase III trial in 16 centers, patients with resectable or borderline resectable pancreatic cancer were randomly assigned to receive preoperative chemoradiotherapy, which consisted of 3 courses of gemcitabine, the second combined with 15 3 2.4 Gy radiotherapy, followed by surgery and 4 courses of adjuvant gemcitabine or to immediate surgery and 6 courses of adjuvant gemcitabine. The primary end point was overall survival by intention to treat. RESULTS Between April 2013 and July 2017, 246 eligible patients were randomly assigned; 119 were assigned to preoperative chemoradiotherapy and 127 to immediate surgery. Median overall survival by intention to treat was 16.0 months with preoperative chemoradiotherapy and 14.3 months with immediate surgery (hazard ratio, 0.78; 95% CI, 0.58 to 1.05; P = .096). The resection rate was 61% and 72% (P = .058). The R0 resection rate was 71% (51 of 72) in patients who received preoperative chemoradiotherapy and 40% (37 of 92) in patients assigned to immediate surgery (P, .001). Preoperative chemoradiotherapy was associated with significantly better disease-free survival and locoregional failure-free interval as well as with significantly lower rates of pathologic lymph nodes, perineural invasion, and venous invasion. Survival analysis of patients who underwent tumor resection and started adjuvant chemotherapy showed improved survival with preoperative chemoradiotherapy (35.2 v 19.8 months; P = .029). The proportion of patients who suffered serious adverse events was 52% versus 41% (P = .096). CONCLUSION Preoperative chemoradiotherapy for resectable or borderline resectable pancreatic cancer did not show a significant overall survival benefit. Although the outcomes of the secondary end points and predefined subgroup analyses suggest an advantage of the neoadjuvant approach, additional evidence is required.Copyright © 2020 by American Society of Clinical Oncology",Excluded

1731,"Dose escalation for patients with locally advanced nasopharyngeal carcinoma treated with radiotherapy alone. OBJECTIVES: The local control of patients with locally advanced nasopharyngeal carcinoma is still unsatisfactory. This prospective study was designed to evaluate the treatment outcomes and treatment-related complications of patients with locally advanced nasopharyngeal carcinoma treated with escalated radiation doses., METHODS: A total of 118 consecutive patients with T4 classification (1992 American Joint Committee on Cancer staging system), histology-proven nonmetastatic nasopharyngeal carcinoma were treated with radiotherapy alone between 1992 and 1997 in a medical center in southern Taiwan. Thirty-two of them were enrolled into a prospective study of dose escalation and were irradiated to a total of 81 Gy. The other 86 patients received a total of 70.2 Gy. Potentially significant patient-related and treatment-related parameters were analyzed for their prognostic significance. Radiation-related complications were recorded and analyzed., RESULTS: The 5-year local progression-free rates were 61%, and 61% for patients receiving 70.2 Gy and 81 Gy, respectively (P > 0.05). The incidences of xerostomia, hearing impairment, and temporal radionecrosis were significantly higher for those receiving 81 Gy. The 5-year complication-free rates of patients receiving 70.2 Gy and 81 Gy were 14% versus 2% for xerostomia (P = 0.0070), 50% versus 30% for hearing impairment (P = 0.0198), and 91% versus 82% for temporal radionecrosis (P = 0.0400)., CONCLUSIONS: For patients with locally advanced nasopharyngeal carcinoma treated with radiotherapy alone, dose escalation to 81 Gy failed to show benefits on local control rate. Higher radiation doses contribute to a higher incidence of radiation-related complications.",Excluded
3005,"Incidental pancreatic cystic lesions: comparison between CT with model-based algorithm and MRI. Introduction: The present study aims to compare low-kV CT reconstructed with MBIR technique with MRI in detecting high-risk stigmata and worrisome features in patients with pancreatic cystic lesions. Method(s): We retrospective enrolled 75 patients who underwent low-kV CT with contrast media injection for general abdominal disorders and MRI with MRCP sequences. The reviewer, blinded to clinical and histopathological data, recorded the overall number of pancreatic cystic lesions, size, location, presence of calcifications, septa, or solid enhancing or non-enhancing components, main pancreatic duct (MPD) communication, and MPD dilatation. Mean differences with 95% limits of agreement, ICC, and kappa statistics were used to compare CT and MRI. Result(s): More pancreatic cystic lesions were detected with MRI than with CT, however, the ICC value of 0.81 suggested a good agreement. According to the evaluated target lesion, a very good agreement (ICC = 0.98) was found regarding the diameter (21.4 mm CT vs 21.8 mm MRI), the location (kappa = 0.90), the detection of MPD dilatation (kappa = 1), the presence of septa (kappa = 0.86) and the MPD communication (kappa = 0.87). A moderate agreement on the assessment of enhanced components was noted (kappa = 0.44), while there was only a fair agreement about the presence of calcifications (kappa = 0.87). Conclusion(s): MDCT can be considered almost equivalent to MRI with MRCP in the evaluation of worrisome features and high-risk stigmata, offering detailed morphologic features helpful for their characterization. Implications for practice: Even if MRI is considered the reference standard in pancreatic cystic lesions characterization, CT can be considered a useful tool as a first-line imaging technique to identify worrisome features and high-risk stigmata.Copyright © 2020 The College of Radiographers",Excluded
3364,"Incidence of pseudoprogression in low-grade gliomas treated with radiotherapy. Background: As the incidence of pseudo-progressive disease (psPD), or pseudoprogression, in low-grade glioma (LGG) is unknown, we retrospectively investigated this phenomenon in a cohort of LGG patients given radiotherapy (RT)., Methods: All MRI scans and clinical data from patients with histologically proven LGG treated with radiation between 2000 and 2011 were reviewed. PsPD was scored when a new enhancing lesion occurred after RT and subsequently disappeared or remained stable for at least a year without therapy, including dexamethasone., Results: Sixty-three out of 71 patients who received RT for LGG were deemed eligible for evaluation of psPD. The median follow-up was 5 years (range 1-10 y). PsPD was seen in 13 patients (20.6%). PsPD occurred after a median of 12 months with a range of 3-78 months. The median duration of psPD was 6 months, with a range of 2-26 months and always occurred within the RT high dose fields of at least 45 Gy. The area of the enhancement at the time of psPD was significantly smaller compared with the area of enhancement during ""true"" progression (median size 54mm2 [range 12-340mm2] vs 270mm2 [range 30-3420mm2], respectively; P = .009)., Conclusions: PsPD occurs frequently in LGG patients receiving RT. This supports the policy to postpone a new line of treatment until progression is evident, especially when patients have small contrast enhancing lesions within the RT field.

366,"Extensive experience in the management of macroprolactinomas. Objectives Macroprolactinomas are pituitary tumours that can be managed with dopamine agonists (DA), surgery and radiotherapy. We aimed to assess the outcomes of these treatment modalities. Design Retrospective case-note study of patients managed in a single tertiary referral centre. Patients One hundred patients (68 male) diagnosed with macroprolactinoma between 1971 and 2009. Measurements We assessed the response to first-line treatment in terms of reduction in serum prolactin, endocrine status, symptomatic improvement and tumour shrinkage. Patients were divided into a group that received only DA therapy and a group that received surgery, radiotherapy or both, with or without a DA. We compared pituitary function at baseline and at last clinic visit between the two groups. Results In total, there were 1170 patient years of follow-up. Pituitary surgery was performed in 29/100 patients. Fourteen patients received pituitary radiotherapy (8/14 surgery also). At last clinic visit, the nonmedical therapy group had a higher risk of gonadotrophin deficiency (77.4% vs 44.8%, P = 0.0037), TSH deficiency (54.8% vs 25.4%, P = 0.0009) and ACTH deficiency (56.2% vs 17.2%, P = 0.0001). When last reviewed, 23/29 (79.3%) patients who underwent surgery and 10/14 (71.4%) patients who received radiotherapy were taking a DA. Conclusions Treatment with a DA alone is associated with better outcomes in terms of pituitary function and as such represents the optimal first-line therapy for macroprolactinomas. Surgery and radiotherapy should be reserved for patients who are either intolerant of or resistant to DAs. Following surgery and/or radiotherapy, the majority of patients still require a DA for control of prolactin hypersecretion. © 2014 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",Excluded
352,"Pretreatment carcinoembryonic antigen level is a risk factor for para-aortic lymph node recurrence in addition to squamous cell carcinoma antigen following definitive concurrent chemoradiotherapy for squamous cell carcinoma of the uterine cervix. BACKGROUND: To identify pretreatment carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) levels as a risk factor for para-aortic lymph node (PALN) recurrence following concurrent chemoradiotherapy (CCRT) for cervical cancer., METHODS: From March 1995 to January 2008, 188 patients with squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) of the uterine cervix were analyzed retrospectively. No patient received PALN irradiation as the initial treatment. CEA and squamous cell carcinoma antigen (SCC-Ag) were measured before and after radiotherapy. PALN recurrence was detected by computer tomography (CT) scans. We analyzed the actuarial rates of PALN recurrence by using Kaplan-Meier curves. Multivariate analyses were carried out with Cox regression models. We stratified the risk groups based on the hazard ratios (HR)., RESULTS: Both pretreatment CEA levels >= 10 ng/mL and SCC-Ag levels < 10 ng/mL (p < 0.001, HR = 8.838), SCC-Ag levels >= 40 ng/mL (p < 0.001, HR = 12.551), and SCC-Ag levels of 10-40 ng/mL (p < 0.001, HR = 4.2464) were significant factors for PALN recurrence. The corresponding 5-year PALN recurrence rates were 51.5%, 84.8%, and 27.5%, respectively. The 5-year PALN recurrence rate for patients with both low (< 10 ng/mL) SCC and CEA was only 9.6%. CEA levels >= 10 ng/mL or SCC-Ag levels >= 10 ng/mL at PALN recurrence were associated with overall survival after an isolated PALN recurrence. Pretreatment CEA levels >= 10 ng/mL were also associated with survival after an isolated PALN recurrence., CONCLUSIONS: Pretreatment CEA >= 10 ng/mL is an additional risk factor of PALN relapse following definitive CCRT for SCC of the uterine cervix in patients with pretreatment SCC-Ag levels < 10 ng/mL. More comprehensive examinations before CCRT and intensive follow-up schedules are suggested for early detection and salvage in patients with SCC-Ag or CEA levels >= 10 ng/mL.",Excluded
863,"The advantage of 3D conformal treatment of lumbar spine metastases in comparison to traditional PA or AP-PA techniques: Restoring an intermediate niche of therapeutic sophistication. Background: To evaluate the effect of the 3D radiation field design on normal tissues compared with commonly used appositional fields in patients with lumbar spine metastases.Methods and materials: Ten comparative treatment plans for radiation of lumbar spine metastases were compared for posterior and anterior- posterior fields with 3D plans. Result(s): The PTV coverage in all comparative plans was similar. V 15 of the bowel in 3D, AP-PA and PA plans was 6.7 Gy (SD 6.47), 39.8 Gy (SD 11.4) and 37.3 Gy (SD15.7), respectively (p < 0.0001). The mean dose to both kidneys was 9.6 Gy (SD 4.8), 4.1 Gy (SD 3.9) and 4.6 Gy (SD 4.4) for appropriate plans (p = 0.002). Maximal dose to the spinal cord was 30.6 Gy (SD 2.1), 33.1 Gy (SD 9.8) and 37.7 Gy (SD 2) for 3D, AP-PA and PA plans. Conclusion(s): 3D conformal treatment planning of lumbar vertebral metastases was significantly better in term of bowel and spinal cord exposure compared to AP-PA and PA techniques. The exposure of the kidneys in 3D plans, while greater than in the comparative plans, did not violate accepted dose-volume thresholds. © 2013 Soyfer et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",Excluded
3150,"The dose-response characteristics of four NTCP models: using a novel CT-based radiomic method to quantify radiation-induced lung density changes. Multiple competing normal tissue complication probability (NTCP) models have been proposed for predicting symptomatic radiation-induced lung injury in human. In this paper we tested the efficacy of four common NTCP models applied quantitatively to sub-clinical X-ray computed tomography (CT)-density changes in the lung following radiotherapy. Radiotherapy planning datasets and follow-up chest CTs were obtained in eight patients treated for targets within the lung or hilar region. Image pixel-wise radiation dose exposure versus change in observable CT Hounsfield units was recorded for early (2-5 months) and late (6-9 months) time-points. Four NTCP models, Lyman, Logistic, Weibull and Poisson, were fit to the population data. The quality of fits was assessed by five statistical criteria. All four models fit the data significantly (p<0.05) well at early, late and cumulative time points. The Lyman model fitted best for early effects while the Weibull Model fitted best for late effects. No significant difference was found between the fits of the models and with respect to parameters D50 and gamma50. The D50 estimates were more robust than gamma50 to image registration error. For analyzing population-based sub-clinical CT pixel intensity-based dose response, all four models performed well.",Excluded
2505,"Difference in subacute blood pressure between office and ambulatory values predicts functional outcome after ischemic stroke. Objective: Acute hypertensive response after ischemic stroke is a self-limiting phenomenon and is associated with functional outcome. Excessive BP fluctuations may reflect increased sympathetic nervous system activity, which can impair the brain repair after stroke. Whether individual BP variation, based on difference between single office and full ambulatory 24-hour BP measurements, have a distinct long-term significance for stroke outcome remains unknown. We tested the hypothesis that subacute BP difference (BPD) [(office BP - mean daytime BP)/ mean daytime BP] is independently associated with stroke outcome. Design and method: In a prospective study, we included 132 patients (age 62.9 +/- 12.9, NIH Stroke Scale score (NIHSS) 7.0+/- 6.2) with acute ischemic stroke. Office (Omron) and Ambulatory BP monitoring (SpaceLabs) was performed on day 7 after stroke onset. The daytime period was defined as the interval from 6 AM to 10 PM. The relationship between these measures (adjusted for age, sex, admission neurological deficit as assessed by NIHSS score, baseline glucose level, and HR) and the 90-day poor outcome (death or dependency, modified Rankin Scale > 2) was studied using a multivariate logistic regression. Result(s): At 3 months, 28 (21.2%) patients had moderate to severe functional impairment after stroke. BPD given as a percentage was significantly higher in patients with poor outcome (14.2 +/-20.5 vs 2.0 +/-13.5; p < 0.001). In univariate analysis, high BPD (OR = 1.56; 95% CI, 1.19-2.05; p = 0.001) was significantly associated with poor stroke outcome. Age, sex, baseline neurological deficit and glucose level, thrombolytic treatment and subacute systolic BP and heart rate measured at day 7 also predicted stroke functional outcome. In multivariate analysis, the predictive value of BPD remained significant (OR = 2.01; 95% CI, 1.15-3.53; p = 0.01) after adjustment for covariates. Office BP also slightly predicted stroke outcome (OR = 1.02; 95% CI, 1.00-1.04; p = 0.04). By contrast, ambulatory BP levels had no significant predictive value after adjustment. Conclusion(s): Difference in BP between subacute office and ambulatory values is an independent predictor of functional outcome in patients after ischemic stroke. Both office and ambulatory BP reading are needed to evaluate stroke prognosis accurately. (Table Presented).",Excluded
1883,"Synchronous Chemoradiotherapy in Patients with Locally Advanced Squamous Cell Carcinoma of the Head and Neck using Capecitabine: A Single-centre, Open-label, Single-group Phase II Study. Aim: To evaluate the efficacy of concurrent oral capecitabine with accelerated hypofractionated radical radiotherapy in locally advanced squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck (SCCHN). Material(s) and Method(s): Between 2001 and 2004, 50 patients with stage III/IV SCCHN (0 to 2 performance status) were enrolled into this study. The capecitabine dose was between 450 and 550mg/m2 twice daily, continuously for 28 days. The radiotherapy dose was 5500cGy in 20 fractions over 4 weeks. No intensity-modulated radiation was used. We evaluated the complete response rate, toxicity, locoregional control, overall survival, disease-free survival and cancer-specific survival. Result(s): The median age was 55 (range 38-76) years; 72% had stage IV disease. The median follow-up was 6 years on the 30 surviving patients. Eighty-two per cent of patients completed the course of capecitabine and 94% completed prescribed radiotherapy. There were no treatment-related deaths, grade 3/4 haematological or renal toxicity. Five patients developed drug-related grade 3/4 acute toxicity (cardiac, skin, bowel); 47 developed grade 3/4 mucositis from chemoradiotherapy. Twenty-two (44%) patients required tube feeding and the tube dependency rate at 1 year was 6%. The complete response rate at 3 months was 90% (45/50 patients). Relapse occurred in 17/50 (34%) patients by 5 years. The locoregional control, overall survival, cancer-specific survival and disease-free survival rates at 3 years were 78, 72, 82 and 62%, respectively, and at 5 years were 72, 64, 75 and 56%, respectively. Conclusion(s): This schedule of synchronous capecitabine for locally advanced SCCHN is well tolerated. The local control in this series compares favourably with other synchronous chemoradiotherapy reports. Chronic dysphagia and tube dependence is uncommon with this approach. Capecitabine as targeted therapy given with each fraction of radiotherapy and administered orally may have significant advantages over intravenous, 3 weekly cisplatin. © 2010 The Royal College of Radiologists.",Excluded

The aim of this study was to investigate variations in the length of time that patients with cancer wait from diagnosis to treatment with radiotherapy. A total of 57,426 men and 71,018 women diagnosed with cancer between 1992 and 2001 and receiving radiotherapy within 6 months of diagnosis were identified from the Thames Cancer Registry database. In total, 12 sites were identified for which a substantial number or proportion of patients received radiotherapy: head and neck, oesophagus, colon, rectum, lung, nonmelanoma skin cancer, breast, uterus, prostate, bladder, brain and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. Median waiting times from diagnosis to radiotherapy were calculated, together with the proportion of patients who received radiotherapy within 60 days of diagnosis, and analysed by year of diagnosis, cancer site, deprivation quintile, age at diagnosis, sex and cancer network of either residence or treatment. Logistic regression was used to adjust the proportion receiving treatment within 60 days for the effects of the other factors. There were significant differences in the proportions receiving radiotherapy within 60 days between different networks and different cancer sites, which remained after adjustment. Median waiting times varied from 42 to 65 days across networks of residence, with the adjusted proportion treated within 60 days ranging from 44 to 71%. There was no difference between male and female patients after adjustment for the other factors, particularly site. There was a highly significant trend over time: the median wait increased from 45 days in 1992 to 76 days in 2001, while the adjusted proportion being treated within 60 days declined by almost a half, from 64 to 35%, over the same period.",Excluded

The patients also completed a questionnaire examining the prevalence of nasal symptoms before and after radiation therapy. Patients who received radiation therapy had no clearance of saccharin from the nasal cavity at a minimum of 20 minutes. The controls had a median clearance time of 5 minutes. The patients noted a higher prevalence of nasal congestion, drainage, and facial pain after radiation therapy.

OBJECT: Stereotactic radiosurgery serves as an important primary and adjuvant treatment option for patients with many types of intracranial meningiomas. This is particularly true for patients with parasellar meningiomas. In this study, the authors evaluated the outcomes of Gamma Knife surgery (GKS) used to treat parasellar meningiomas., METHODS: The study is a retrospective review of the outcomes in 138 patients with meningiomas treated at the University of Virginia from 1989 to 2006; all patients had a minimum follow-up of 24 months. There were 31 men and 107 women whose mean age was 54 years (range 19-85 years). Eighty-four patients had previously undergone resection. The mean pre-GKS tumor volume was 7.5 ml (range 0.2-54.8 ml). Clinical and radiographic evaluations were performed, and factors related to favorable outcomes in each case were assessed., RESULTS: The mean follow-up duration was 84 months (median 75.5 months, range 24-216 months). In 118 patients (86%), the tumor volume was unchanged or had decreased at last follow-up. Kaplan-Meier analysis demonstrated radiographic progression-free survival at 5 and 10 years to be 95.4% and 69%, respectively. Fourteen patients (10%) developed new cranial nerve palsies following GKS. Factors associated with tumor control included younger age, a higher isodose, and smaller tumor volume. A longer follow-up duration was associated with either a decrease or increase in tumor volume. Fourteen patients (10%) experienced new or worsening cranial nerve deficits after treatment. Factors associated with this occurrence were larger pretreatment tumor volume, lower peripheral radiation dose, lower maximum dose, tumor progression, and longer follow-up., CONCLUSIONS: Gamma Knife surgery offers an acceptable rate of tumor control for parasellar meningiomas and accomplishes this with a low incidence of neurological deficits. Radiological control after radiosurgery is more likely in those patients with a smaller tumor volume and a higher prescription dose.",Excluded

2356,"Early stage transplantation of bone marrow cells markedly ameliorates copper metabolism and restores liver function in a mouse model of Wilson disease. Background: Recent studies have demonstrated that normal bone marrow (BM) cells transplantation can correct liver injury in a mouse model of Wilson disease (WD). However, it still remains unknown when BM cells transplantation should be administered. The aim of this study was to investigate the potential impact of normal BM cells transplantation at different stages of WD to correct liver injury in toxic milk (tx) mice. Method(s): Recipient tx mice were sublethally irradiated (5 Gy) prior to transplantation. The congenic wild-type (DL) BM cells labeled with CM-DiI were transplanted via caudal vein injection into tx mice at the early (2 months of age) or late stage (5 months of age) of WD. The same volume of saline or tx BM cells were injected as controls. The DL donor cell population, copper concentration, serum ceruloplasmin oxidase activity and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) levels in the various groups were evaluated at 1, 4, 8 and 12 weeks post-transplant, respectively. Result(s): The DL BM cells population was observed from 1 to 12 weeks and peaked by the 4th week in the recipient liver after transplantation. DL BM cells transplantation during the early stage significantly corrected copper accumulation, AST across the observed time points and serum ceruloplasmin oxidase activity through 8 to 12 weeks in tx mice compared with those treated with saline or tx BM cells (all P < 0.05). In contrast, BM cells transplantation during the late stage only corrected AST levels from 4 to 12 weeks post-transplant and copper accumulation at 12 weeks post-transplant (all P < 0.05). No significant difference was found between the saline and tx BM cells transplantation groups across the observed time points (P > 0.05).

2872,"Comparing outcomes of stereotactic body radiotherapy with intensity-modulated radiotherapy for patients with locally advanced unresectable pancreatic cancer. OBJECTIVES: Survival in patients with locally advanced unresectable pancreatic cancer (LAUPC) is poor, and local recurrence continues to be a major problem in the management of this disease. Radiotherapy (RT) using different RT techniques, including intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) and stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT), may lead to different clinical outcomes for patients with LAUPC. Here, we compared SBRT with IMRT for patients with LAUPC with respect to survival rate, local control (LC) rate, and toxicity-related dose distribution. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This retrospective study from March 2007 to March 2011 included 41 patients with LAUPC who were divided into two groups, with 20 patients receiving SBRT and 21 patients receiving IMRT. The median follow-up time was 16 months. RESULT(S): For the IMRT and SBRT groups, the median survival times were 13 and 20 months, and 1-year overall survival (OS) rates were 70.7 and 80.0%, respectively. There was no difference in OS between the two RT techniques. RT with SBRT showed significantly better local disease-free survival than IMRT for patients with LAUPC. Tobacco use had a borderline effect on LC. Thus, further statistical analysis showed that patients who used tobacco had better LC after receiving SBRT than IMRT. CONCLUSION(S): SBRT improved LC for LAUPC patients and had similar radiation toxicity compared with IMRT. Further study is required to define the effects of administered radiation dose and fractionation, as well as to further expand the sample size, to use a prospective study, and to observe the long-term efficacy of these techniques..Copyright © 2015 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

The sustained use of intraoperative fluoroscopy has led to increased use of minimally invasive surgical techniques, enhanced surgeon proficiency, improved anatomic corrections, reduced patient morbidity, earlier functional recovery, and decreased length of hospital stay. As a result, orthopedic attending surgeons and residents are exposed to more radiation, increasing the risk of cancer and radiation-induced cataracts compared with the general population and those who work in other surgical specialties. The magnitude of radiation exposure depends on the susceptibility of the tissues affected, medical specialty, the position of the C-arm, distance from the radiation beam, level of difficulty of the surgical procedure, surgeon experience, level of resident training, and level of supervision by the attending surgeon. However, little information is available on the effect of supervision level on radiation exposure for orthopedic senior residents. The goal of this study was to investigate whether level of supervision by the attending surgeon affects the radiation exposure of orthopedic senior residents during surgical treatment of proximal femur fracture with cephalomedullary nail fixation. This retrospective cohort study was performed from January 2019 to March 2019. No significant relationship between supervision level and radiation exposure of senior residents was observed. Supervision level does not significantly affect radiation exposure for senior residents; therefore, the implementation of standardized training in radiation safety may be a more essential measure to decrease radiation exposure.Copyright © 2021 Slack Incorporated.

2591,"Predictors of toxicity associated with stereotactic body radiation therapy to the central hepatobiliary tract. PURPOSE: To identify dosimetric predictors of hepatobiliary (HB) toxicity associated with stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) for liver tumors., METHODS AND MATERIALS: We retrospectively reviewed 96 patients treated with SBRT for primary (53%) or metastatic (47%) liver tumors between March 2006 and November 2013. The central HB tract (cHBT) was defined by a 15-mm expansion of the portal vein from the splenic confluence to the first bifurcation of left and right portal veins. Patients were censored for toxicity upon local progression or additional liver-directed therapy. HB toxicities were graded according to Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events version 4.0. To compare different SBRT fractionations, doses were converted to biologically effective doses (BED) by using the standard linear quadratic model alpha/beta = 10 (BED10)., RESULTS: Median follow-up was 12.7 months after SBRT. Median BED10 was 85.5 Gy (range: 37.5-151.2). The median number of fractions was 5 (range: 1-5), with 51 patients (53.1%) receiving 5 fractions and 29 patients (30.2%) receiving 3 fractions. In total, there were 23 (24.0%) grade 2+ and 18 (18.8%) grade 3+ HB toxicities. Nondosimetric factors predictive of grade 3+ HB toxicity included cholangiocarcinoma (CCA) histology (P<.0001), primary liver tumor (P=.0087), and biliary stent (P<.0001). Dosimetric parameters most predictive of grade 3+ HB toxicity were volume receiving above BED10 of 72 Gy (VBED1072) >= 21 cm(3) (relative risk [RR]: 11.6, P<.0001), VBED1066 >= 24 cm(3) (RR: 10.5, P<.0001), and mean BED10 (DmeanBED10) cHBT >=14 Gy (RR: 9.2, P<.0001), with VBED1072 and VBED1066 corresponding to V40 and V37.7 for 5 fractions and V33.8 and V32.0 for 3 fractions, respectively. VBED1072 >= 21 cm(3), VBED1066 >= 24 cm(3), and DmeanBED10 cHBT >=14 Gy were consistently predictive of grade 3+ toxicity on multivariate analysis., CONCLUSIONS: VBED1072, VBED1066, and DmeanBED10 to cHBT are associated with HB toxicity. We suggest VBED1072 < 21 cm(3) (5-fraction: V40 < 21 cm(3); 3-fraction: V33.8 < 21 cm(3)), VBED1066 < 24 cm(3) (5-fraction: V37.7 < 24 cm(3); 3-fraction: V32 < 24 cm(3)) as potential dose constraints for the cHBT when clinically indicated.

1284,"Lifetime attributable risk of cancer from CT among patients surviving severe traumatic brain injury. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to determine the lifetime attributable risk of cancer from CT among patients surviving severe traumatic brain injury., MATERIALS AND METHODS: A retrospective cross-sectional study was conducted with prospectively collected data on patients 16 years old and older admitted with a Glasgow coma scale score of 8 or less to a single level 1 trauma center from 2007 to 2010. The effective dose of each CT examination the patients underwent was predicted with literature-accepted effective dose values of standard helical CT protocols. The lifetime attributable risk of cancer and related mortality incurred as a result of CT were estimated with the cumulative effective dose incurred from the time of injury to a 1-year follow-up evaluation and with the approach established by the Biologic Effects of Ionizing Radiation VII report., RESULTS: The average patient was a 34-year-old man. The median number of CT examinations received during the first 12 months after injury was 20, and the average cumulative effective dose was 87 +/- 45 mSv. This resulted in increases in the lifetime incidence of all cancer types from 45.5% to 46.3% and in the lifetime incidence of cancer-related mortality from 22.1% to 22.5%., CONCLUSION: Radiation exposure from the use of CT in the evaluation and management of severe traumatic brain injury causes negligible increases in lifetime attributable risk of cancer and cancer-related mortality. Treating physicians should not allow the concern for future risk of radiation-induced cancer to influence decisions regarding radiographic evaluation in the acute treatment of traumatic brain injury.",Excluded
3310,"Low sensitivity of the sister chromatid exchange assay to detect the genotoxic effects of radioiodine therapy. To assess the genotoxic risk associated with 131I therapy, sister chromatid exchanges (SCEs) and cells with unusually high SCE counts (HFC) were determined in a follow-up study performed with 46 hyperthyroidism and 39 thyroid cancer patients treated with 131I. In addition, a crosssectional study was also carried out with 78 control persons and 51 thyroid cancer patients that had completed radioiodine therapy from 1 to 6 years prior to the current investigation. In the follow-up analysis, the study was conducted over time and four blood samples were drawn from each patient: the first one prior to the radioiodine treatment, with the remaining three taken sequentially over the year after therapy. Concerning the results obtained for the whole population in the follow-up study, the SCE and HFC values found after radioiodine therapy did not show any significant increase, neither in the hyperthyroidism nor thyroid cancer groups. Unlike the results mentioned above, when the effect of smoking habit was considered, there was a slight but significant increase in SCE in the samples taken 3 months and 1 week after 131I therapy in the hyperthyroidism and thyroid cancer non-smokers, respectively. The data obtained in the cross-sectional study did not show differences in SCE and HFC between the control group and the cancer group treated with 131I. It is noteworthy that among the different parameters analysed, smoking habit is the only factor that showed a direct relationship with SCE and HFC and, as a consequence, smokers had significantly more SCE and HFC than nonsmokers. Taking into account our previous investigations showing a highly significant increase in the frequency of micronuclei for the same patients and sampling times, the outcomes obtained would suggest that the eventual genotoxic effect of 131I therapy could not be dearly detected by the SCE assay. This would reinforce the view that ionizing radiation appears to be a poor inducer of SCEs.",Excluded
3271,"Clinical criteria for obtaining maxillofacial computed tomographic scans in trauma patients. BACKGROUND: Over 150,000 patients present with maxillofacial trauma annually to emergency rooms in the United States. Although maxillofacial computed tomography is a sensitive screening tool for identifying facial fractures, indiscriminate use leads to unnecessary radiation exposure and substantial costs. A decision instrument is needed to ensure computed tomographic evaluation of patients at high risk for facial fracture and limit computed tomography use in low-risk patients., METHODS: A retrospective review was conducted of all patients evaluated at a Level I trauma center over a 3-year period. Inclusion criteria were maxillofacial examination on presentation, maxillofacial computed tomography, and head computed tomography. A total of 525 patients met the enrollment criteria., RESULTS: Injury to the maxillofacial skeleton occurred in 332 patients (63.2 percent). The presence of any of the following five physical examination criteria identified patients at high risk for facial fracture: bony stepoff or instability, periorbital swelling or contusion, Glasgow Coma Scale score less than 14, malocclusion, or tooth absence. These criteria identified all but six of the 332 patients with a facial fracture (sensitivity, 98.2 percent; 95 percent confidence interval, 96.5 to 99.1 percent). The negative predictive value was 87.8 percent (95 percent confidence interval, 76.3 to 94.2 percent). No patient determined by these criteria to be at low risk for a facial fracture required surgical treatment. If these criteria had been applied to the study population, radiographic imaging could have been avoided in 9.3 percent of patients., CONCLUSIONS: A decision instrument based on clinical criteria can ensure appropriate screening of patients at high risk for facial fracture. Application of this instrument may reduce unnecessary maxillofacial imaging.",Excluded
3012,"Contamination of banked femoral head allograft: Incidence, bacteriology and donor follow up. Background: Allograft donations are not uncommonly found to be contaminated. The issue of contaminated donations from live donors at the time of surgery, and the significance of this to the patient in terms of subsequent sepsis of the arthroplasty, were examined. Method(s): The donations of femoral heads to the Queensland Bone Bank over a 9-year period were reviewed, and the incidence and bacteriology of contamination were detailed. Clinical outcomes were determined for donors who had positive cultures at the time of retrieval and they were compared with those of culture-negative donors. Result(s): Between March 1987 and February 1996, 232 femoral heads were donated to the Queensland Bone Bank. Four specimens were sent for culture with each femoral head (surface swab of femoral head, acetabular swab, bone biopsy and capsule). In 51 cases, one or more positive cultures were obtained (22% contamination rate). The majority of organisms cultured were Staphylococcus epidermidis. One hundred and seventy donations came from surgery performed at the Princess Alexandra Hospital, and 40 femoral heads were considered contaminated. Deep infection was recorded in one of the 40 cases with contaminated donations and three out of 130 non-contaminated donations had subsequent septic episodes. Conclusion(s): The contamination rate detailed in the present report is higher than in most series. This may be due to the fact that four bacteriological specimens are taken to assess contamination. Two of these specimens are tissue samples which yielded more positive results than did the two swabs. All other series take no more than two bacteriological specimens, which are usually bone swabs. These are shown to have a poor yield of positive cultures. Therefore there is a significant underestimation of contamination rates by other bone banks. This has implications for the recipients of bone from those banks, particularly when the allograft material is not secondarily sterilized. This is important given increasing allograft usage, and the increasing numbers of revision joint arthroplasty and impaction grafting procedures being performed. Sterilization of all bone by irradiation to 25 kGy is recommended.",Excluded
2854,"The Use of Public Health Indicators to Assess Individual Happiness in Post-Disaster Recovery. PURPOSE: Very few studies have examined the influential factors of survivors' feelings of happiness in the context of nuclear accidents. This paper aims to fill this gap with reference to the recovery process in Fukushima City following the 2011 Tohoku Earthquake Tsunami in Japan., METHODS: Open access data were sourced from the 2015 Social Survey on Living and Disaster Recovery (SSLDR) (N = 1439) of Fukushima citizens. Pearson's Chi-square Test and the t-test were employed to examine gender differences with regard to happiness and exploratory variables. Following this, a multiple linear regression analysis was conducted to investigate the determinants of happiness., RESULTS: The results showed that, compared to females, male respondents were unhappier and reported more property loss and less neighborhood connectedness. Individuals' mental and physical health and neighborhood connectedness were found to be significantly correlated with their happiness. However, the disaster-related variables of people's evaluation of recovery achievement, concerns around the health impacts of radiation, property loss in the disaster, and experiences of casualty, had no effects on happiness., CONCLUSION: These findings indicate that policies and countermeasures dealing with disaster recovery over the long term should continuously focus on health issues and social relationships.",Excluded
3282,"Late radiation side-effects in three patients undergoing parotid irradiation for benign disease. We report three patients in whom standard radiation therapy was given and serious late radiation damage was seen. The first patient suffered recurrent parotiditis and a parotid fistula. He was treated initially with 20 Gy in ten fractions via a 300 kV field. Further irradiation was required 1 year later and 40 Gy was given in 2 Gy fractions by an oblique anterior and posterior wedged photon pair. Ten years later he developed localized temporal bone necrosis. The second patient, with pleomorphic salivary adenoma, developed localized temporal bone necrosis 6 years after 60 Gy had been given using standard fractionation and technique. The third patient received 55 Gy in 25 fractions for a pleomorphic salivary adenoma and after 3 years developed temporal bone necrosis. Sixteen years later the same patient developed cerebellar and brainstem necrosis. All patients developed chronic persistent infection during or shortly after the radiation therapy, which increased local tissue sensitivity to late radiation damage. As a result, severe bone, cerebellar and brainstem necrosis was observed at doses that are normally considered safe. We therefore strongly recommend that any infection in a proposed irradiated area should be treated aggressively, with surgical debridement if necessary, before radiotherapy is administered, or that infection developing during or after irradiation is treated promptly.",Excluded
1240,"Apolipoprotein E epsilon4 and age effects on florbetapir positron emission tomography in healthy aging and Alzheimer disease. Objectives: Investigate apolipoprotein E epsilon4 (APOE4) gene and aging effects on florbetapir F18 positron emission tomography (PET) in normal aging and Alzheimer's disease (AD). Method(s): Florbetapir F18 PET images were analyzed from 245 participants, 18-92 years of age, from Avid Radiopharmaceutical's multicenter registered trials, including 86 younger healthy control volunteers (yHC), 61 older healthy control volunteers (oHC), 53 mild cognitive impairment (MCI) patients, and 45 AD dementia patients (DAT). Mean florbetapir standard uptake value ratios (SUVRs) were used to evaluate the effects of APOE4 carrier status, older age, and their interaction in each of these groups. Result(s): In comparison with non-carriers, the APOE4 carriers in each of the oHC, MCI, and DAT groups had higher mean cortical-to-cerebellar florbetapir SUVRs, patterns of florbetapir PET elevations characteristic of DAT, and a higher proportion meeting florbetapir PET positivity criteria. Only the oHC group had a significant association between mean cortical florbetapir SUVRs and age. In cognitively normal adults, without regards to APOE4 genotype, amyloid began to increase at age 58 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 52.3-63.7), with a predicted typical age of florbetapir positivity occurring around age 71 years. Presence of the APOE4 gene reduced the age of predicted florbetapir positivity in normal aging to around age 56 years, approximately 20 years younger than non-carriers. Interpretation(s): Cerebral amyloid deposition is associated with APOE4 carrier status in older healthy control subjects and symptomatic AD patients, and increases with age in older cognitively normal individuals. Amyloid imaging positivity appears to begin near age 56 years in cognitively intact APOE4 carriers and age 76 years in APOE4 non-carriers. © 2013 Elsevier Inc.",Excluded
3492,"Removal of comfort pads underneath babies: a method of reducing radiation exposure to neonates. RATIONALE AND OBJECTIVES: The recent increasing utilization of imaging has increased the population exposure to ionizing radiation. With increasing knowledge of the potential harm of radiation exposure, efforts should be made to minimize patient radiation whenever possible, especially in young children. The purpose of this study was to use the exposure index (EI) standard to assess the potential for reducing radiation dose to babies by removing a soft comfort pad, often placed underneath the baby. The pad is located between the baby and the image detector plate. As such it absorbs x-rays that have already passed through the baby but have not yet reached the imaging detector plate. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Using a thoracic infant phantom and fixed exposure factors, we measured the percentage of the radiation exiting a neonatal chest phantom that was absorbed/attenuated by the comfort pad, before it hit the detector to create the image. We studied comfort pads of 4 different thicknesses, ranging from 0.5 to 8. RESULTS: Radiation beam attenuation, ranging from 12% to 72.1%, was found with all comfort pads, with increased x-ray beam attenuation occurring with increasing pad thickness. CONCLUSIONS: The study shows that comfort pads cause a high attenuation of the radiation beam, after it exits the chest phantom. As such, removal of the pads prior to radiographic exposure of babies is a method of potentially reducing patient radiation exposure in the newborn nursery.",Excluded
379,"Hormonal suppression restores fertility in irradiated mice from both endogenous and donor-derived stem spermatogonia. Irradiation interrupts spermatogenesis and causes prolonged sterility in male mammals. Hormonal suppression treatment with gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) analogues has restored spermatogenesis in irradiated rats, but similar attempts were unsuccessful in irradiated mice, monkeys, and humans. In this study, we tested a stronger hormonal suppression regimen (the GnRH antagonist, acyline, and plus flutamide) for efficacy both in restoring endogenous spermatogenesis and in enhancing colonization of transplanted stem spermatogonia in mouse testes irradiated with a total doses between 10.5 and 13.5 Gy. A 4-week hormonal suppression treatment, given immediately after irradiation, increased endogenous spermatogenic recovery 1.5-fold, and 11-week hormonal suppression produced twofold increases compared with sham-treated irradiated controls. Furthermore, 10-week hormonal suppression restored fertility from endogenous surviving spermatogonial stem cells in 90% of 10.5-Gy irradiated mice, whereas only 10% were fertile without hormonal suppression. Four-and 11-week hormonal suppression also enhanced spermatogenic development from transplanted stem spermatogonia in irradiated recipient mice, by 3.1-and 4.8-fold, respectively, compared with those not given hormonal treatment. Moreover, the 10-week hormonal suppression regimen, but not a sham treatment, restored fertility of some 13.5-Gy irradiated recipient mice from donor-derived spermatogonial stem cells. This is the first report of hormonal suppression inducing recovery of endogenous spermatogenesis and fertility in a mouse model treated with anticancer agents. The combination of spermatogonial transplantation with hormonal suppression should be investigated as a treatment to restore fertility in young men after cytotoxic cancer therapy. © The Author 2010.

2798,"Design of a motion simulation system to assist respiratory gating for radiation therapy. Stereotactic ablative radiotherapy (SABR) aims to deliver high doses of radiation to kill cancer cells and shrink tumors in less than or equal to 6 fractions. However, organ motion during treatment is a challenging issue for this kind of technique. We develop a control system via Bluetooth technology to simulate and correct body motion during SABR. Method(s): Radiation doses were analyzed, and the radiation damage protection capability was checked by external beam therapy 3 (EBT3) films irradiated by a linear accelerator. A wireless signal test was also performed. A validation was performed with 8 previously treated patient respiratory pattern records and 8 healthy volunteers. Result(s): The homemade simulation system consisted of 2 linear actuators, one movable stage with a maximal moving distance of 6.5 cm x 12.5 cm x 5 cm to simulate the respiratory pattern of 8 patients precisely with a median error of 0.36 mm and a maximal motion difference of 1.17 mm, and 3.17 and chipset transited signals to display them as a waveform. From the test with 8 volunteers, the chip could detect deep respiratory movement up to 3 cm. The effect of the chip on a radiation dose of 400 monitor units (MUs) by 6 MV photons and 200 MUs by 10 MV photons showed high penetration rates of 98.8% and 98.6%, respectively. Conclusion(s): We invented a tubeless and wireless respiratory gating detection chip. The chip has minimal interference with the treatment angles, good noise immunity and the capability to easily penetrate a variety of materials.

1493,"Optimisation of imaging technique used in direct digital radiography. The purpose of the study was to optimise the technique employed for AP shoulder and lateral cervical spine examinations following an investigation into image quality, based on clinical assessment, and effective dose, calculated from patient entrance surface dose measurements. A study was therefore conducted in an attempt to determine whether the increased radiation dose to the patient following the introduction of an anti-scatter grid was justified by the level of improvement in image quality. The study, involving 100 patients, was able to demonstrate that the increase in radiation dose to the patient when using an anti-scatter grid for AP shoulder examinations is not justified by the improved image quality. A poor level of inter-rater reliability between the consultants scoring the lateral cervical spine images prevented a firm conclusion from being reached. The fact that all images were of diagnostic quality, however, suggested that the use of the anti-scatter grid was unnecessary.

Objective: The aim of the study was to evaluate the possible effects of calyceal choice for renal puncture under sonographic guidance on the outcomes of percutaneous nephrolithotomy (PNL). Material(s) and Method(s): A total of 70 patients for whom ultrasound-guided PNL was planned for 20-30-mm single renal pelvic stones were prospectively allocated to group 1 (n:35) with middle calyx entry or group 2 (n:35) with lower calyx entry. Procedure-related parameters such as duration of operation, stone-free rates, complication rates, and radiation exposure time were analyzed in detail. Result(s): The mean age of the patients was 45.67 +/- 1.50 years and the mean stone size was 316.4 +/- 17.95 mm2. There was no significant difference regarding the age, BMI, stone burden, and the grade of hydronephrosis between the groups. Skin to collecting system distance was significantly shorter in the middle calyx entrance (p = 0.021). Total duration of the procedure was again significantly shorter in group 1 cases (74.69 +/- 2.94 min) than in group 2 (84.29 +/- 4.25 min) (p = 0.003). Regarding the success rates, the postoperative stone-free rate was higher in group 1 (91.4% in group 1, 80.0% in group 2, p = 0.305). Last, there was no statistically significant difference in hemoglobin reduction rates, blood transfusion requirements, and complication rates between the 2 groups. Conclusion(s): Getting access to the renal pelvis through the middle calyx during ultrasonic guided PNL procedure is more advantageous to lower the calyceal approach by reducing both the duration of the PNL procedure with significantly higher stone-free and comparable complication rates.© 2020 S.

147,"Distal interphalangeal joint bony dimensions related to headless compression screw sizes. Purpose To determine the radiographic dimensions of the distal interphalangeal (DIP) joint and to compare these measurements with commonly used headless compression screws. Methods Using standard posteroanterior and lateral radiographs of the hand, we measured the dimensions of the distal and middle phalanges in 60 index, middle, ring, and little fingers. We then compared these measurements with the diameters and lengths of 16 commercially available headless compression screws commonly used to perform DIP joint arthrodesis. Percent compatibility and risk factors for incompatibility were determined. Results In general, commercially available screw diameters were too large given the anatomic dimensions of the DIP joint. The distal phalanx shaft as measured on the lateral view was the narrowest determinant of fit. When the dimensions of all fixation devices were combined, screws were oversized relative to the bony anatomy in 66% of index fingers, 53% of middle fingers, 49% of ring fingers, and 72% of little fingers. This mismatch was greater in women than in men. Only 1 of the compression screw types demonstrated a compatibility rate greater than 90% for the index and little fingers, respectively. A multivariate analysis of independent risk factors showed the likelihood of a compatible fit to vary directly with patient height and to be less likely in the little and index fingers. Interobserver reliability analysis revealed excellent x-ray measurement correlation between observers. Conclusions A size mismatch existed between the anatomic dimensions of the DIP joint and commercially available headless compression screws. Caution must be used when considering these screws for DIP joint arthrodesis, to avoid problems related to screw prominence in the narrow aspects of the distal and middle phalanges. Clinical relevance Headless compression screws are frequently oversized for use in DIP arthrodesis. © 2014 ASSH Published by Elsevier, Inc. All rights reserved.",Excluded
1923,"An analysis of the factors influencing radiation dose and fluoroscopic time during renal artery stent placement. Purpose: To determine the factors that affect mean absorbed dose and fluoroscopic times during renal artery stent placement. Material(s) and Method(s): After institutional review board approval, the HI-IQ database was queried for patients undergoing renal artery stent placement only from January 2007 to June 2010. Procedures that were performed as part of other procedures such as iliac artery stents were excluded. The HI-IQ data included fluoroscopy time (f) and radiation dose (mGy). Demographic, medical history, procedural details, and advanced preprocedural renal artery stent imaging were obtained. Variables (number of stents, average body mass index , number of stents placed per year and number of years service of an interventional physician, pre-procedural imaging, and use of embolic protection device) were analyzed using a t test after log transformation and testing for variance with an F test. Result(s): A total of 134 patients (75 males, 70.6 +/- 10.5 years old) underwent the placement of 177 renal artery stents (unilateral [n =95], average stent per patient =1.3). Mean fluoroscopy time was 15.6 minutes and mean absorbed dose to the patient was 1729 mGy. The average fluoroscopic time and absorbed dose was significantly higher with bilateral stent placement compared to unilateral placement (13.8 vs 19.7 minutes, P =.002; 1803 vs 2380 mGy, P =.03). The average fluoroscopic time was significantly higher in patients undergoing abdominal aortogram prior to renal artery selection and stent placement. Conclusion(s): The placement of more than 1 stent with an abdominal angiogram prior to renal artery stent placement results in increased fluoroscopic time and mean absorbed dose.",Excluded

Purpose: To evaluate the feasibility, safety, and dosimetric results of volumetric modulated arc therapy (VMAT) to deliver hypofractionated radiotherapy (RT) in oesophageal cancer patients, unfit for a multimodality curative strategy. Patients/methods: From 2010 to 2017, 22 patients were treated with hypofractionated VMAT for palliative/symptomatic setting. The prescription dose was 40 Gy in 16 fractions (EQD2 41.7 Gy considering an alpha/beta ratio of 10 Gy, and 44 Gy considering an alpha/beta ratio of 3 Gy). Result(s): Eight patients (36%) were symptomatic for grade 3 baseline dysphagia. RT was generally well tolerated, and no patient interrupted the daily treatment. Acute toxicity was generally mild; no G3 acute toxicities were reported. At the end of treatment, 5 patients (22.7%) experienced a stable dysphagia and 14 (63.6%) an improvement of baseline dysphagia, while 3 patients (13.7%) reported a worsening of oesophagitis. At a mean follow-up of 8.7 months, 15 patients (79%) had a complete clinical recovery (G0-1) of the symptomatic moderate/severe dysphagia. At 3 months after the end of RT, seven patients (31.8%) achieved a partial or complete response. Two coplanar arcs were employed for VMAT delivery. Dosimetric results were consistent in terms of both target coverage and normal tissue sparing. Finally, 1-year progression-free and overall survival was 20% and 27.3%, respectively.

2885,"Cisplatin-based chemoradiation plus cetuximab in locally advanced head and neck cancer: A phase II clinical study. Background: Intensification of chemoradiation for advanced head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) is unlikely due to toxicity. Cetuximab combined either with radiotherapy or with chemotherapy showed favourable toxic profile with positive results in both combinations. Therefore, cetuximab could intensify chemoradiation without worsening toxicity. We conducted a phase II study of chemoradiation and cetuximab. Patients and Methods: Eligible patients had stage III-IV M0 HNSCC. Treatment consisted of three cycles of cisplatin (20 mg/m2/day x 5 days) and fluorouracil (200 mg/m2/day x 5 days) rapidly alternated to three split courses of radiotherapy up to 70 Gy and concurrent weekly cetuximab. The primary end point of the study was complete response (CR) rate. Secondary end points were toxicity, progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS). Result(s): Fourty-five patients were enrolled: median age was 56 years, 38 had stage IV disease and 40 nodal involvement. CR occurred in 32 patients (71%). PFS and OS was 21+ months and 32.6+, respectively. Acute grade 3-4 toxic effects were in the expected range, but grade 3 radiodermatitis occurred in 33 patients. Conclusion(s): The combination of cetuximab, cisplatin, fluorouracil and radiotherapy leads to a very high proportion of CR and it is feasible with toxic effects similar to those expected by radiochemotherapy. The only unexpected toxicity was skin toxicity: grade 3 radiodermatitis occurred in 73% of the patients. © The Author 2010.

Total fluoroscopy effective dose for all collimation strategies amounted to 45 +/- 31 mSv for a single collimation field (Sc 1), 36 +/- 25 mSv (Sc 2), and 24 +/- 14 mSv (Sc 3) for a symmetrically adjusted collimation window and 15 +/- 10 (Sc 4) and 5 +/- 3 mSv (Sc 5) for an asymmetrically adjusted collimation approach. Validation of symmetric (Sc 2) and asymmetric (Sc 4) collimation in 10 patients confirmed the retrospective analysis., CONCLUSIONS: Implementation and effective application of an optimal asymmetric collimation approach would yield an average three- to nine-fold reduction of fluoroscopy dose during AF ablation procedures. This reduction exceeds what has been previously reported by implementing an electromagnetic catheter tracking approach. Furthermore, it can be easily integrated in the clinical workflow with limited additional one-time cost. Manufacturers of imaging systems should consider its implementation a priority, and physicians should adopt it in their workflow.",Excluded
2093,"Can the implementation of aerospace science in elementary school help girls maintain their confidence and engagement in science as they transition to middle school?. There is a global crisis due to a lack of qualified applicants entering STEM careers, especially in science. Add the fact that women are greatly underrepresented in science, and the solution becomes obvious. Go to the source, and find out why girls as young as 12 years old are losing an interest in scientific endeavors that they once found to be captivating. This action research project sought to find out if the implementation of aerospace science, embedded both in the classroom and in an after school Space Club, could assist girls in maintaining their confidence and engagement in science overall as they transition to middle school. Furthermore, girls in fifth through seventh grade, who had previously been the teacher researcher's students, were included in the study in order to discover if their previous participation in a variety of authentic and ongoing aerospace activities had any impact upon their engagement in science as they entered the notable years of declined interest. The research took place at an international American school, Academia Cotopaxi, in Quito, Ecuador from September 2015 through April 2016. Data was collected through both qualitative and quantitative sources, and included attitude surveys, parent questionnaires, a writing prompt, photos, video, interviews and observations. Additionally, a control group was utilized in grades five to seven for purposes of comparison. Innovative activities included engaging and first-hand experiences with the Ecuadorian Civilian Space Agency (EXA), the National Aeronautics Space Administration (NASA), Space X and the Canadian Space Agency (CSA). Inquiry-based activities included, but were not limited to, experiences with: speaking live with both astronauts and cosmonauts on the International Space Station, robotics, rocketry, Skype chats with aerospace professionals, utilizing the Design Process, online resources and more. Findings suggested that embedding aerospace science in grade four, both during and after school hours, not only increased girls' interest and confidence in science, but also served to maintain and foster an interest in STEM as they transitioned to middle school.

1169,"No effects of a single 3G UMTS mobile phone exposure on spontaneous EEG activity, ERP correlates, and automatic deviance detection. Potential effects of a 30 min exposure to third generation (3G) Universal Mobile Telecommunications System (UMTS) mobile phone-like electromagnetic fields (EMFs) were investigated on human brain electrical activity in two experiments. In the first experiment, spontaneous electroencephalography (sEEG) was analyzed (n = 17); in the second experiment, auditory event-related potentials (ERPs) and automatic deviance detection processes reflected by mismatch negativity (MMN) were investigated in a passive oddball paradigm (n = 26). Both sEEG and ERP experiments followed a double-blind protocol where subjects were exposed to either genuine or sham irradiation in two separate sessions. In both experiments, electroencephalograms (EEG) were recorded at midline electrode sites before and after exposure while subjects were watching a silent documentary. Spectral power of sEEG data was analyzed in the delta, theta, alpha, and beta frequency bands. In the ERP experiment, subjects were presented with a random series of standard (90%) and frequency-deviant (10%) tones in a passive binaural oddball paradigm. The amplitude and latency of the P50, N100, P200, MMN, and P3a components were analyzed. We found no measurable effects of a 30 min 3G mobile phone irradiation on the EEG spectral power in any frequency band studied. Also, we found no significant effects of EMF irradiation on the amplitude and latency of any of the ERP components. In summary, the present results do not support the notion that a 30 min unilateral 3G EMF exposure interferes with human sEEG activity, auditory evoked potentials or automatic deviance detection indexed by MMN.

530,"Dual-source versus 64-section CT coronary angiography at lower heart rates: comparison of accuracy and radiation dose. PURPOSE: To compare the diagnostic performance and radiation doses of dual-source and 64-section computed tomographic (CT) coronary angiography for the diagnosis of significant coronary stenoses in patients with heart rates of 65 beats/min or less., MATERIALS AND METHODS: This retrospective study had local ethics committee approval; all patients gave written informed consent. Two hundred patients with heart rates of 65 beats/min or less were enrolled; 100 underwent dual-source and 100 underwent 64-section CT coronary angiography. Two blinded observers independently assessed image quality of all coronary segments by using a four-point scale and searched for significant (>50%) stenoses in each segment. Catheter angiography was used as the reference standard. Image noise was measured in the ascending aorta. Radiation doses were calculated., RESULTS: No significant differences were found regarding sex, age, body weight, cardiovascular risk profile, prevalence of stenosis, mean and variability of heart rate, Agatston score, and image noise (all P > .1) between patients in both CT coronary angiography groups. No significant difference was found in the rate of nonassessable coronary segments between dual-source (1.0%, 14 of 1405) and 64-section CT coronary angiography (1.8%, 25 of 1387; P = .08). Motion artifacts occurred significantly more often in 64-section (21 of 25) versus dual-source (five of 14, P = .004) CT coronary angiography. Segment-based accuracy and specificity were significantly higher for dual-source versus 64-section CT coronary angiography. There was no significant difference in accuracy parameters at the per-vessel and per-patient analyses. No significant difference (P = .13) was found between the effective doses of dual-source (mean +/- standard deviation, 10.9 mSv +/- 1.1) and 64-section CT (10.4 mSv +/- 1.7) coronary angiography., CONCLUSION: In patients with heart rates of 65 beats/min or less, the higher temporal resolution of dual-source CT coronary angiography results in improved accuracy and specificity for the diagnosis of significant stenoses on a per-segment level at a similar radiation dose, but provides a comparable diagnostic accuracy on a patient-based level as does 64-section coronary angiography.",Excluded
1802,"Surgery rates in Danish incident cases of ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease in the era of biological treatment a seven-year cohort study follow up. Background: Resent studies indicate that biological treatment (anti TNF alpha treatment) reduces surgery rates. We aim in this seven-year follow-up study of unselected, incident patients diagnosed with Crohns disease and ulcerative colitis to assess surgery rates in the era of biological treatment. Method(s): From Jan. 1st 2003 to Dec. 31st 2004 all incident cases of patients diagnosed with CD (n = 208), UC (n = 328) or indeterminate colitis (IC, n = 27) were registered in a well defined Copenhagen area. All medical journals applicable for follow-up were reviewed and data on disease localization and behaviour according to the Montreal classifications, medications, endoscopies, X-ray-/CT-/MR-procedures, admissions, surgical events, cancers and deaths were registered. Result(s): The present follow-up study cohort consists of 186 CD and 265 UC. Of the 563 patients originally included in the study, 42 patients were excluded at follow-up. Twenty-eight patients did not have inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), 14 were not incident and 5 had IC. Eighteen (10 UC, 8 CD) were lost to follow-up and 47 (28 UC, 19 CD) deceased and were also excluded. The mean age in the present study was 38.7 years (median 35.0 range 1-93) and included 265 females and 251 males. All patients were followed for 7 years from diagnosis. For UC, 32 patients (12.1%) had a colectomy during the 7 years follow-up. Incidence of colectomy at 5 years was 9.8% (26 patients) and 8.7% (23) at 2 years. Fifty-two CD patients (28%) had their first intestinal resection (excluding fistula- and/or abscess's surgery) within 7 years follow-up. Forty-five (24.2%) had a resection within 5 years and 35 (18.8%) within 2 years follow-up. At 7 years follow-up 28 (8.0%) UC patients and 49 (26.6%) CD patients had at some point had biological treatment. Conclusion(s): Twenty-eight percent CD patients and 12.1% UC patients had their first surgery within 7 years follow-up. The surgical rates for CD in the present study in ""the biological era"" are lower than a previous Danish inception cohort from 1962-87 with surgical rates of 63% during ten years. However, it seems comparable to the surgery rates referred by the IBSEN study group, who reported 5 year surgical rates of CD and UC to 28.0% and 7.5% respectively in the mid-nineties.

156,"Effects of dual-energy CT with non-linear blending on abdominal CT angiography. Objective: To determine whether non-linear blending technique for arterial-phase dual-energy abdominal CT angiography (CTA) could improve image quality compared to the linear blending technique and conventional 120 kVp imaging. Material(s) and Method(s): This study included 118 patients who had accepted dual-energy abdominal CTA in the arterial phase. They were assigned to Sn140/80 kVp protocol (protocol A, n = 40) if body mass index (BMI) < 25 or Sn140/100 kVp protocol (protocol B, n = 41) if BMI >= 25. Non-linear blending images and linear blending images with a weighting factor of 0.5 in each protocol were generated and compared with the conventional 120 kVp images (protocol C, n = 37). The abdominal vascular enhancements, image noise, signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR) and radiation dose were assessed. Statistical analysis was performed using one-way analysis of variance test, independent t test, Mann-Whitney U test, and Kruskal-Wallis test. Result(s): Mean vascular attenuation, CNR, SNR and subjective image quality score for the non-linear blending images in each protocol were all higher compared to the corresponding linear blending images and 120 kVp images (p values ranging from < 0.001 to 0.007) except for when compared to non-linear blending images for protocol B and 120 kVp images in CNR and SNR. No significant differences were found in image noise among the three kinds of images and the same kind of images in different protocols, but the lowest radiation dose was shown in protocol A.

1298,"MRI can play a decisive role in establishing acute and chronic muscle infarction as the primary and often unsuspected cause of sickle cell crisis: A 20-year follow-up of prior and current cases. Objective: To demonstrate that MRI rather than radionuclide, CT, ultrasound or PET scans is most efficient and specific in establishing muscle infarction as the primary cause of sickle cell crisis. MRI can therefore serve as a basis for initiating prompt treatment in the emergency department or nontreatment in the setting of suspected addiction. Longstanding chronic changes are also important to recognize. Material(s) and Method(s): Thirty patients with sickle cell disease included 17 patients followed for 20 years (6 male, 11 female; age range, 17-55 years, 15 with sickle cell anemia and 2 sickle beta thalassemia) with MRI-documented muscle infarcts initially imaged within 24-72 hours of limb pain utilizing Phillips 0.5-T superconductive magnets with interim and more recent studies using superconductive 1.5- and 3-T magnets (Sigma, GE Healthcare), dedicated extremity coils, and T1-weighted, fast spin-echo, fat-saturated, and fluid-sensitive sequences. Result(s): All studies showed acute and chronic abnormal MRI soft-tissue patterns. One third of lower limbs (20 of 60 prior patients) had focally increased signal loci compatible with acute or subacute inflammation, edema, or both associated with hemorrhage or ischemia. In cases without SI alteration in bone or soft tissue, sickle cell crisis could not be substantiated. In the 20 limbs with increased SI loci followed for 20 years, changes ranged from diminishing signal alterations to complete, often bilaterally symmetric curvilinear or rectangular signal voids attributed to infarcts or fibrosis. Recent radiographs when interpreted without adequate history or referral to prior MR studies showed large focal ossifications at one of multiple sites in upper and lower limbs compatible with myositis ossificans without known conventional trauma. Conclusion(s): MR imaging can function as an effective problem solver in patients with sickle cell disease with extremity pain without definitive evidence on multiple other imaging modalities in instances of suspected sickle cell crisis. Chronic or long delayed soft-tissue changes of sickle cell crisis are important to recognize along with muscle involvement in an acute crisis. The latter leads to prompt treatment in the emergency department or no treatment in instances of suspected addiction. Chronic soft-tissue changes are also important since they may be mistaken for nonspecific entities, e.g., myositis ossificans in all stages of repair and resolution on the commonly used imaging modalities in modern practice. Routine radiographs most specifically document mature ossifications.",Excluded
1218,"Dynamic CTA in Native Kidneys Using a Multiphase CT Protocol-Potential of Significant Reduction of Contrast Medium. RATIONALE AND OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to assess an optimized renal multiphase computed tomography angiography (MP-CTA) protocol regarding reduction of contrast volume., MATERIALS AND METHODS: Thirty patients underwent MP-CTA (12 phases, every 3.5 seconds, 80 kV/120 mAs) using 30 mL of contrast medium. The quality of MP-CTA was assessed quantitatively measuring vessel attenuation, image noise, and contrast-to-noise ratio. MP-CTA was evaluated qualitatively regarding depiction of vessels, cortex differentiation, and motion artifacts (grades 1-4, 1 = best). Mean effective radiation dose was registered. Results were compared to standard renal computed tomography angiography (CTA) (80 mL). Student t test was applied, if variables followed normal distribution. For other variables, nonparametric Mann-Whitney U test was used., RESULTS: All acquisitions were successfully performed, and no patient had to be excluded from the study. MP-CTA enabled high attenuation (aorta: 503 +/- 91 HU, renal arteries: 450 +/- 73 HU/456 +/- 72 HU) at adequate image noise (13.7 +/- 1.5) and good contrast-to-noise ratio (34.2 +/- 10.2). Good attenuation of renal veins was observed (286 +/- 43 HU/282 +/- 42 HU). Arterial enhancement was significantly higher compared to renal CTA (aorta: 396 +/- 90 HU, renal arteries: 331 +/- 74 HU/333 +/- 80 HU; P < .001). MP-CTA protocol enabled good image quality of renal arteries (1.5 +/- 0.6) and veins (1.7 +/- 0.6). Cortex differentiation and motion artifacts were ranked 1.8 +/- 0.8 and 1.6 +/- 0.8. The mean effective radiation dose was 9 mSv (MP-CTA)., CONCLUSIONS: Compared to standard renal CTA, the renal MP-CTA enabled the significant reduction of contrast volume and simultaneously provided a significantly higher arterial attenuation.

1082,"Relationship of Th17/treg cells and radiation pneumonia in locally advanced esophageal carcinoma. Background/Aim: Radiation pneumonia is a main side-effect that has limited the clinical usage of radiotherapy in locally advanced esophageal carcinoma. T helper cells 17 (Th 17) and T regulatory cells (Tregs) play an important role in inflammatory diseases. The balance between Treg and Th17 cells is a key factor in the progression of many inflammatory and autoimmune diseases. Whether Tregs and Th17 cells are predictive factors of radiation pneumonia has not yet been reported. In this study, we investigated the relationships of Treg/Th17 cells and radiation pneumonia in patients with locally advanced esophageal cancer who received radiotherapy. Patients and Methods: One hundred and forty-eight patients with locally advanced esophageal cancer who received radical and palliative radiotherapy were enrolled. The levels of Th17 and Treg cells in the blood of patients were detected using flow cytometry at the time point of pre-radiotherapy, 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th, 5th and 6th week from the start of radiation and 4 weeks after completion of radiotherapy. Radiation pneumonia was evaluated according to Radiation Therapy Oncology Group's acute radiation pneumonia standards, with the endpoint being grade 2 or above radiation pneumonia. Result(s): There were 24 cases of radiation pneumonia in 148 cases of locally advanced esophageal cancer patients who underwent radiotherapy. Th17 cells increased and, in contrast, Treg cells decreased in the radiation pneumonia group. The change in the ratio of Th17/Treg was more pronounced and the difference was statistically significant from the 5th week after irradiation compared to patients with no radiation pneumonia (p<0.05). There was no significant difference in dosimetric parameters, including V5, V20, V30 and mean lung dose (MLD) and clinical factors, such as gender, age, smoking history, history of surgery and chemotherapy. Conclusion(s): The ratio of Th17/Treg cells may be an effective predictive factor of radiation pneumonia.",Excluded
3102,"Treatment efficiency of combining photodynamic therapy and ionizing radiation for Bowen's disease. BACKGROUND: Topical 5-aminolevulinic acid photodynamic therapy (ALA-PDT) is widely used for treating Bowen's disease (BD), but recurrence and tumour cell persistence after ALA-PDT is sometimes problematic. Radiation therapy (RT) is also effective for BD, but is limited by its side-effects, such as refractory ulcers., OBJECTIVE: The objective of the study was to observe a synergic effect of combination therapy with ALA-PDT and RT for BD cases that did not respond effectively to prior ALA-PDT., METHODS: Subjects were BD patients whose lesion did not show complete remission or showed recurrence after prior ALA-PDT. A total of four cases involving four lesions were studied (three male and one female, mean age 69.5). ALA ointment (20%) was applied to the lesions. After 4 to 6h, subjects received combination therapy consisting of excimer-pumped dye laser radiation at 630nm (50J/cm(2) ) followed by electron-beam radiation (3Gy). The combination therapy was repeated every 2 to 3days for a total of four treatments. The lesions were evaluated clinically or histologically after the final combination therapy session., RESULTS: Following combination therapy, all of the lesions disappeared. Recurrence was not detected during the observations periods, which averaged 14.0months in duration., CONCLUSION: Our results indicate that the cure rate of BD could be improved by combination therapy with ALA-PDT and RT. Compared with conventional RT, the synergetic effect of this therapy might reduce the dose of radiation required, thereby also reducing skin side-effects such as refractory ulcers.

PURPOSE: To evaluate the feasibility of using virtual noncontrast material-enhanced (VNC) computed tomographic (CT) series derived from dual-energy CT imaging studies for coronary artery calcium quantification., MATERIALS AND METHODS: This HIPAA-compliant study was institutional review board approved; all patients provided written informed consent. Thirty-six patients prospectively underwent noncontrast-enhanced CT calcium scoring followed by coronary CT angiography performed in dual-energy mode. By using different reconstruction algorithms, three VNC series were generated and evaluated for noise and efficiency of virtual iodine removal. Two readers independently quantified calcium on VNC images and true noncontrast-enhanced conventional calcium scoring series. A leave-one-out cross validation was used to assess the accuracy of calcium score prediction from VNC series by means of linear regression., RESULTS: CT value histograms of the VNC series closely resembled the profile in the true noncontrast-enhanced series. There was excellent correlation between calcium volumes on the VNC series and true noncontrast-enhanced series on a per-patient (r = 0.94, P < .001, n = 36) and per-vessel (r = 0.94, 0.91, and 0.92 for the three coronary arteries, all P < .001, n = 36 each) level. The ability of a linear regression model to predict actual calcium scores from calcium volumes on VNC series was excellent (r = 0.82). Multiethnic Study of Atherosclerosis rankings that were derived from the predicted calcium scores also showed excellent agreement (intraclass correlation coefficient = 0.909)., CONCLUSION: Coronary artery calcium identification and quantification based on dual-energy coronary CT angiographic studies may obviate the need for dedicated CT calcium scoring studies.

Thyroid volume has been reported as one of the factors influencing radioiodine therapy outcome in man and cats. The goal of this study was to describe the most reliable and practically applicable formula to determine thyroid volume using scintigraphy. The volume of each thyroid lobe of 32 hyperthyroid cats was determined by ultrasound and scintigraphy. The ultrasonographically determined volume (ellipsoid formula) for each thyroid lobe was compared with the scintigraphic volume that was calculated using eight different formulas: F1 [(pi/6) x L x H x W], F2 [(pi /2) x L x W(2)], F3 [0.33 x (area cm(2))(3/2)], F4 [1.08 x (pi /6) x L x W(2)], F5 (area x H), F6 (0.27 x area x L), F7 (pi x L x W(2)) and F8 [pi x (4/3) x W(3)]. F1, F3, F4 and F6 did not differ statistically from the volumes measured on ultrasound, while F2, F5, F7 and F8 did.

2005,"Use of radiomics combined with machine learning method in the recurrence patterns after intensity-modulated radiotherapy for nasopharyngeal carcinoma: A preliminary study. Objective: To analyze the recurrence patterns and reasons in patients with nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) treated with intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) and to investigate the feasibility of radiomics for analysis of radioresistance. Method(s): We analyzed 306 NPC patients treated with IMRT from Jul-2009 to Aug-2016, 20 of whom developed with recurrence. For the NPCs with recurrence, CT, MR, or PET/CT images of recurrent disease were registered with the primary planning CT for dosimetry analysis. The recurrences were defined as in-field, marginal or out-of-field, according to dose-volume histogram (DVH) of the recurrence volume. To explore the predictive power of radiomics for NPCs with in-field recurrences (NPC-IFR), 16 NPCs with non-progression disease (NPC-NPD) were used for comparison. For these NPC-IFRs and NPC-NPDs, 1117 radiomic features were quantified from the tumor region using pretreatment spectral attenuated inversion-recovery T2-weighted (SPAIR T2W) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC) and Pearson correlation coefficient (PCC) was calculated to identify influential feature subset. Kruskal-Wallis test and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis were employed to assess the capability of each feature on NPC-IFR prediction. Principal component analysis (PCA) was performed for feature reduction. Artificial neural network (ANN), k-nearest neighbor (KNN), and support vector machine (SVM) models were trained and validated by using stratified 10-fold cross validation. Result(s): The median follow up was 26.5 (range 8-65) months. 9/20 (45%) occurred in the primary tumor, 8/20 (40%) occurred in regional lymph nodes, and 3/20 (15%) patients developed a primary and regional failure. Dosimetric and target volume analysis of the recurrence indicated that there were 18 in-field, and 1 marginal as well as 1 out-of-field recurrence. With pre-therapeutic SPAIR T2W MRI images available, 11 NPC-IFRs (11 of 18 NPC-IFRs who had available pre-therapeutic MRI) and 16 NPC-NPDs were subsequently employed for radiomic analysis. Results showed that NPC-IFRs vs. NPC-NPDs could be differentiated by 8 features (AUCs: 0.727-0.835). The classification models showed potential in prediction of NPC-IFR with higher accuracies (ANN: 0.812, KNN: 0.775, SVM: 0.732). Conclusion(s): In-field and high-dose region relapse were the main recurrence patterns which may be due to the radioresistance. After integration in the clinical workflow, radiomic analysis can be served as imaging biomarkers to facilitate early salvage for NPC patients who are at risk of in-field recurrence.Copyright © 2018 Li, Wang, Hou, Yang, Ren, Gao, Meng, Wu, Liu, Liu and Yan.

1079,"Aldehyde dehydrogenase, a therapeutic target in chordoma: Analysis in 3d cellular models. Chordomas are rare, slow-growing tumors of the axial skeleton. These tumors are locally aggressive and refractory to conventional therapies. Radical surgery and radiation remain the first-line treatments. Despite these aggressive treatments, chordomas often recur and second-line treatment options are limited. The mechanisms underlying chordoma radioresistance remain unknown, although several radioresistant cancer cells have been shown to respond favorably to aldehyde de-hydrogenase (ALDH) inhibition. The study of chordoma has been delayed by small patient cohorts and few available models due to the scarcity of these tumors. We thus created cellular 3D models of chordoma by using low-adherence culture systems. Then, we evaluated their radiosensitivity using colony-forming and spheroid size assays. Finally, we determined whether pharmacologically inhibiting ALDH increased their radiosensitivity. We found that 3D cellular models of chordoma (derived from primary, relapse, and metastatic tumors) reproduce the histological and gene expression features of the disease. The metastatic, relapse, and primary spheroids displayed high, me-dium, and low radioresistance, respectively. Moreover, inhibiting ALDH decreased the radiore-sistance in all three models.Copyright © 2021 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.",Excluded
3027,"Delineating chromosomal breakpoints in radiation-induced papillary thyroid cancer. Recurrent translocations are well known hallmarks of many human solid tumors and hematological disorders, where patient- and breakpoint-specific information may facilitate prognostication and individualized therapy. In thyroid carcinomas, the proto-oncogenes RET and NTRK1 are often found to be activated through chromosomal rearrangements. However, many sporadic tumors and papillary thyroid carcinomas (PTCs) arising in patients with a history of exposure to elevated levels of ionizing irradiation do not carry these known abnormalities. We developed a rapid scheme to screen tumor cell metaphase spreads and identify candidate genes of tumorigenesis and neoplastic progression for subsequent functional studies. Using a series of overnight fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) experiments with pools comprised of bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) clones, it now becomes possible to rapidly refine breakpoint maps and, within one week, progress from the low resolution Spectral Karyotyping (SKY) maps or Giemsa-banding (G-banding) karyotypes to fully integrated, high resolution physical maps including a list of candiate genes in the critical regions. © 2011 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.",Excluded

2891,"Statistical shape modeling predicts patellar bone geometry to enable stereo-radiographic kinematic tracking. Complications in the patellofemoral (PF) joint of patients with total knee replacements include patellar subluxation and dislocation, and remain a cause for revision. Kinematic measurements to assess these complications and evaluate implant designs require the accuracy of dynamic stereo-radiographic systems with 3D-2D registration techniques. While tibiofemoral kinematics are typically derived by tracking metallic implants, PF kinematic measurements are difficult as the patellar implant is radiotransparent and a representation of the resected patella bone requires either pre-surgical imaging and precise implant placement or post-surgical imaging. Statistical shape models (SSMs), used to characterize anatomic variation, provide an alternative means to obtain the representation of the resected patella for use in kinematic tracking. Using a virtual platform of a stereo-radiographic system, the objectives of this study were to evaluate the ability of an SSM to predict subject-specific 3D implanted patellar geometries from simulated 2D image profiles, and to formulate an effective data collection methodology for PF kinematics by considering accuracy for a variety of patient pose scenarios. An SSM of the patella was developed for 50 subjects and a leave-one-out approach compared SSM-predicted and actual geometries; average 3D errors were 0.45 +/- 0.07 mm (mean +/- standard deviation), which is comparable to the accuracy of traditional segmentation. Further, initial imaging of the patella in five unique stereo radiographic perspectives yielded the most accurate representation. The ability to predict the remaining patellar geometry of the implanted PF joint with radiographic images and SSM, instead of CT, can reduce radiation exposure and streamline in vivo kinematic evaluations.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Ltd",Excluded
3374,"Factors associated with acute and late dysphagia in the DAHANCA 6 & 7 randomized trial with accelerated radiotherapy for head and neck cancer. BACKGROUND: Dysphagia is a common and debilitating side effect in head and neck radiotherapy (RT). Prognostic factors are numerous and their interrelationship not well understood. The aim of this study was to establish a multivariate prognostic model for acute and late dysphagia after RT, based on information from a prospective trial., MATERIAL AND METHODS: The DAHANCA 6&7 randomized study included 1476 patients with head and neck cancer eligible for primary RT alone. Patients were randomized between 5 and 6 weekly fractions of conventional RT, and received 62-70 Gy in 31-35 fractions. Patients were scored for dysphagia weekly during treatment and at regular intervals until five years after treatment. Dysphagia scores were available from 1461 patients., RESULTS: Acute dysphagia according to DAHANCA grades 1, 2, 3 and 4 occurred in 83%, 71%, 43% and 23%, respectively. Severe dysphagia occurred in 47% and 38% of patients receiving accelerated or conventional radiotherapy, respectively (p = 0.001). At one, two, three, four and five years the prevalence of chronic dysphagia above grade 0, was 46%, 32%, 29%, 24%, 23%, respectively with no difference between 5 and 6 fractions. In multivariate analysis, the following parameters were independent factors for severe acute dysphagia: T3-T4 tumors, N-positive disease, non-glottic cancer, age> median, baseline dysphagia > 1 and accelerated radiotherapy. The following factors were prognostic factors for late dysphagia: non-glottic cancer, T3-T4, N-positive disease and baseline dysphagia > 1. The data confirmed previously published predictive models, as it was possible to separate patients in groups with low, medium and high risk of dysphagia, respectively, based on pre-treatment risk scores., CONCLUSION: Prognostic models were established to characterize patients at risk of developing acute or late dysphagia in the DAHANCA 6&7 trial. The results may be useful to identify patients at risk of dysphagia and thus candidates for prophylactic measures against swallowing dysfunction.",Excluded
2242,"Types of injury from recreational snowboarding versus skiing: Single season-data from a Mountainside clinic in Dolomites. Objectives: With this study we aim to compare the patterns of injury of skiers and snowboarders in order to provide useful data on the topic. Equipment and methods: This is a retrospective cohort study which analyzed data of patients presented at a mountainside clinic for a ski- or snowboard-related injury between 4th December 2016 and 17th April 2017. Result(s): In total, 1605 patients were screened, of whom 210 were excluded as they did not meet inclusion criteria, leaving 1395 (1099 skiers and 296 snowboarders) patients for analysis. Multiple injuries were recorded in 64 (5.8%) skiers and 13 (4.4%) snowboarders (P = 0.416). There was a lower rate of female gender (n = 95, 32.1% vs. n = 575, 52.3%; P < 0.0001) among snowboarders which were also significantly younger than skiers (median 25 years, IQR 16-32 vs. 42 IQR 23-52; P < 0.0001). In 172 (15.7%) of injuries the injured skier did not cause the accident versus in 21 cases (7.1%) among snowboarders (P = 0.0002).

2466,"Early Experience and Lessons Learnt with Customized Fenestrated Thoracic Endovascular Aortic Reconstruction for Aortic Arch Pathology in an Asian Population. Purpose: Thoracic endovascular aortic repair (TEVAR) is the preferred treatment of descending thoracic aorta pathology. However, TEVAR in the aortic arch remains challenging. Customized fenestrated TEVAR (fTEVAR) allows extension of the proximal seal zone, while preserving the involved supra-aortic vessels. There is a paucity of information on fTEVAR; hence, we aim to evaluate our early experience and lessons learnt with fTEVAR in the aortic arch. Method(s): This is a retrospective single-centre review of fTEVAR endografts for aortic arch pathology over 24 months. Seven patients with mean age of 72.8 years (range 63-84 years) were included. A total of 15 supra-aortic branches were treated [left subclavian artery (n = 7), left carotid artery (n = 5), innominate artery (n = 1), bovine origins (n = 2)], involving a total of nine fenestrations and six scallops. No supra-aortic debranching was required. Result(s): Median follow-up was 15 months. Technical success was 86%, and one patient had malalignment of the fTEVAR endograft requiring salvage with double chimney technique. There were no early endoleaks with one type 2 endoleak detected in the follow-up period. Two access site pseudoaneurysms required intervention. There was a learning curve involved reflected by higher than average mean operative time of 224 min with average radiation dose of 3029.86 mGy and mean contrast volume of 283 mls. Conclusion(s): fTEVAR in the aortic arch is feasible in Asian patients, although there was a learning curve involved, and careful patient selection is advised. Longer term data in a larger population are required to assess its durability.Copyright © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature and the Cardiovascular and Interventional Radiological Society of Europe (CIRSE).",Excluded
2507,"Feasibility and potential utility of multicomponent exhaled breath analysis for predicting development of radiation pneumonitis after stereotactic ablative radiotherapy. INTRODUCTION: In this prospective pilot study, we evaluated the feasibility and potential utility of measuring multiple exhaled gases as biomarkers of radiation pneumonitis (RP) in patients receiving stereotactic ablative radiotherapy (SABR) for lung tumors., METHODS: Breath analysis was performed for 26 patients receiving SABR for lung tumors. Concentrations of exhaled nitric oxide (eNO), carbon monoxide (eCO), nitrous oxide (eN2O), and carbon dioxide (eCO2) were measured before and immediately after each fraction using real-time, infrared laser spectroscopy. RP development (CTCAE grade >=2) was correlated with baseline gas concentrations, acute changes in gas concentrations after each SABR fraction, and dosimetric parameters., RESULTS: Exhaled breath analysis was successfully completed in 77% of patients. Five of 20 evaluable patients developed RP at a mean of 5.4 months after SABR. Acute changes in eNO and eCO concentrations, defined as percent changes between each pre-fraction and post-fraction measurement, were significantly smaller in RP versus non-RP cases (p = 0.022 and 0.015, respectively). In an exploratory analysis, a combined predictor of baseline eNO greater than 24 parts per billion and acute decrease in eCO less than 5.5% strongly correlated with RP incidence (p =0.0099). Neither eN2O nor eCO2 concentrations were significantly associated with RP development. Although generally higher in patients destined to develop RP, dosimetric parameters were not significantly associated with RP development., CONCLUSIONS: The majority of SABR patients in this pilot study were able to complete exhaled breath analysis. Baseline concentrations and acute changes in concentrations of exhaled breath components were associated with RP development after SABR. If our findings are validated, exhaled breath analysis may become a useful approach for noninvasive identification of patients at highest risk for developing RP after SABR.",Excluded
3232,"Occurrence of Phosphenes in Patients Undergoing Proton Beam Therapy for Ocular Tumor. Purpose: Phosphenes are frequently reported by patients irradiated in the head and neck area. The aim of the present study was to characterize and investigate potential mechanisms of proton beam therapy (PBT)-induced phosphenes in a large population of patients undergoing PBT for ocular tumors. Design(s): Prospective cohort study. Method(s): Consecutive patients who underwent PBT in a single center were included. Immediately after the first session, all patients completed a questionnaire collecting information about the presence of phosphenes as well as their color, shape, and duration. Patient, tumor and treatment characteristics (dose volume histograms) were also collected. Result(s): Among the 474 patients included, 62.8% reported phosphenes during the first session of PBT. Reported colors were mainly blue-violet (70.5%) and white (14.1%). The prevalence of phosphenes was higher in younger patients (P =.003); other patient or ocular characteristics were not associated with the occurrence of phosphenes. Irradiation of the macula (P <.001) and/or optic disc (P <.001) were significantly associated with the presence of phosphenes, whereas blue-violet color was only associated with young age and irradiation of macular area (P =.04). Pupillary constriction was reported for 57.1% of patients with phosphenes vs 18.5% of patients without (P <.001). Blue-violet phosphenes (P <.001) and irradiation of macula (P =.001) were statistically associated with pupillary constriction. Conclusion(s): The present study reported a high rate of phosphenes in patients irradiated by PBT for ocular tumor. Their blue-violet color and their association with a pupillary constriction probably indicates the stimulation of S-cones and retinal ganglion cells that reflects the activation of the afferent visual pathway.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.",Excluded
1808,"Radiation exposure and cost influence physician medical image decision making: a randomized controlled trial. BACKGROUND: It is estimated that 20%-40% of advanced medical imaging in the United States is unnecessary, resulting in patient overexposure to radiation and increasing the cost of care. Previous imaging utilization studies have focused on clinical appropriateness. An important contributor to excessive use of advanced imaging may be a physician ""knowledge gap"" regarding the safety and cost of the tests., OBJECTIVES: To determine whether safety and cost information will change physician medical image decision making., RESEARCH DESIGN: Double-blinded, randomized controlled trial. Following standardized case presentation, physicians made an initial imaging choice. This was followed by the presentation of guidelines, radiation exposure and health risk, and cost information., RESULTS: Approximately half (57 of 112, 50.9%) of participants initially selected computed tomography (CT). When presented with guideline recommendations, participants did not modify their initial imaging choice (P=0.197). A significant reduction (56.3%, P<0.001) in CT ordering occurred after presentation of radiation exposure/health risk information; ordering changed to magnetic resonance imaging or ultrasound (US). A significant reduction (48.3%, P<0.001) in CT and magnetic resonance imaging ordering occurred after presentation of Medicare reimbursement information; ordering changed to US. The majority of physicians (31 of 40, 77.5%) selecting US never modified their ordering. No significant relationship between physician demographics and decision making was observed., CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests that physician decision making can be influenced by safety and cost information and the order in which information is provided to physicians can affect their decisions.",Excluded
3632,"Clinicopathologic features as stronger prognostic factors than histology or grade in risk stratification of primary parotid malignancies. BACKGROUND: The aim of this study, using a retrospective chart review as the primary study design, was to determine the relative contribution of clinicopathologic risk factors versus low- and high-risk grade histologic groups to assist management of primary parotid cancers.
METHODS: In all, 168 primary parotid malignancies were treated surgically at a tertiary care center from 1982 to 2005. Of these, 115 patients with complete follow-up information were further analyzed. Pathologic updating and reclassification in 28% of cases enabled comparison of tumor histology or grade with current consensus criteria. Clinical outcomes of high- and low-risk histology and grade were compared with the influence of traditional clinicopathologic risk factors.
RESULTS: Of 115 cases, the male:female ratio was equal and the median age was 63 years (range, 15 to 89 years). Mucoepidermoid carcinoma (n = 28) was the most common histology. The median follow-up was 44 months (range, 0–278 months). Of low-risk histology patients who underwent neck dissection 40% had pN+ disease. The median time to recurrence was not reached for low-risk tumors, compared with 29 months for high-risk tumors (p = .0001). Interestingly, extracapsular spread (ECS) and margin status were independent prognostic factors and conferred significantly greater prognostic value than histologic grade risk group. Disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS) at 5 years for the entire cohort were 51% and 57%, respectively. Risk group was a strong independent predictor of OS but not DFS.
CONCLUSIONS: Risk group defined by histology and grade was associated with DFS. ECS and margin status were independent predictors of DFS. Inclusion of ECS and margin status substantially improved the prediction of disease recurrence, supporting elective neck dissection and postoperative radiotherapy for high-grade tumors or low-risk histologies with positive margins or ECS.",Excluded
956,"Endoscopic lateral approach thyroid lobectomy: safe evolution from endoscopic parathyroidectomy. INTRODUCTION: Endoscopic thyroid surgery has been shown to be feasible. Most minimal access procedures have been performed via a midline approach. Based on our experience of more than 500 endoscopic parathyroidectomies via a lateral approach we have used the same method for thyroid lobectomy., METHODS: We present our experience of endoscopic thyroid lobectomy via a lateral approach (ETLA) and review of the results over a 1-year period (2004). Inclusion criteria for ETLA were (1) solitary nodule with atypical/suspicious fine-needle biopsy (FNB) or solitary toxic nodule; (2) lesions with a diameter of < 3 cm. Patients with a history of previous neck surgery or radiation exposure were excluded. All patients underwent postoperative vocal cord checks and plasma calcium evaluation., RESULTS: A total of 742 thyroid procedures were performed during 2004. Among them, 38 patients (5.1%) underwent ETLA. Indications for surgery were suspicious FNB results (36 patients) and a toxic nodule (2 patients). Mean nodule size was 19.2 mm. Mean +/- SD operating time was 102 +/- 27 minutes. All recurrent laryngeal nerves were identified (including one that was nonrecurrent). Of the 38 patients, the superior parathyroid gland was identified in 36 and the inferior parathyroid gland in 33. There were two conversions due to difficulty with the dissection. Two operations were converted because malignancy was diagnosed on frozen section examination. Two patients underwent a delayed completion thyroidectomy when definitive histology necessitated it. There were no permanent operative complications, and all patients were discharged on the first postoperative day., CONCLUSIONS: ETLA offers excellent intraoperative visualization of the vital structures and is a safe alternative to conventional thyroid lobectomy in selected cases.",Excluded
1689,"Evaluation of gait speed after applying kinesio tape on quadriceps femoris muscle in patients with knee osteoarthritis. BACKGROUND: Knee osteoarthritis is a chronic degenerative disease, known as the most common cause of difficulty walking in older adults and subsequently is associated with slow walking. Functional decline, increased risk of falls and the presence of pain are, in many studies, related to the muscle weakness caused by osteoarthritis especially weakness of the quadriceps muscles. Many studies have shown that the strength of the quadriceps femoris muscle can affect gait, by improving or weakening it. Kinesio Tape is a physiotherapeutic technique, which reduces pain and increases muscular strength by irritating the skin receptors. AIM: This study aimed to verify if the application of Kinesio Tape on quadriceps femoris muscle increases gait speed while decreasing the time needed to accomplish the 10-meter walk test in patients with knee osteoarthritis and also in subjects without knee osteoarthritis. METHOD(S): In this study, we observed the change of gait speed with the help of the 10-meter walk test before, one day and three days after the application of Kinesio Tape in quadriceps femoris muscle. We compared the results of the time needed to perform the 10-meter walk in two groups. In the first group, the Patients group, participated 102 out-patients with a clinical diagnosis of primary knee osteoarthritis, while in the second group, the Control group, participated 73 subjects with a main excluding criterion a clinical diagnosis of primary knee osteoarthritis. RESULT(S): Our results indicated that there was a significant decrease of time needed to perform the 10-meter walk test in both groups three days after application of Kinesio Tape on quadriceps femoris muscle. However, there was not a significant change one day after the application of Kinesio Tape compared before its application in both groups. CONCLUSION(S): Our results indicated that there was a significant decrease in time needed to accomplish the 10-meter walk test. Kinesio Tape is a technique that can be used especially when changing walking stereotypes is a long-term goal of the treatment.Copyright © 2018 Klejda Tani, Irena Kola, Vjollca Shpata, Fregen Dhamaj.

1934,"The efficacy of tin-filtration for computed tomography in diagnosing urolithiasis. INTRODUCTION: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the radiation dose and image quality of computed tomography urograms (CTU) using tin-filtration compared to conventional CTU (without tin-filtration) examinations in patients with suspected urolithiasis., METHODS: Group 1 consisted of 100 patients who were examined using the tin-filtered CTU protocols (Sn100kVp or Sn150kVp); Group 2 consisted of 100 patients who were examined using the same protocols but without tin-filtration (GE-NI41 or GE-NI43). The scanning protocol was based on the patients' body weight (<80kg and >=80kg). The effective doses of all scans were compared between the two groups. Subjective image quality was evaluated by two blinded radiologists. The objective image quality was assessed for noise, signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR) and figure-of-merit (FOM) using the CTU scans acquired from both the tin-filtered and non-tin-filtered protocols., RESULTS: Tin-filtration resulted in the reduction of effective radiation dose ranging between 72% to 88% for the >=80kg and <80kg patient groups respectively. For both groups, tin-filtration resulted in no significant differences in SNR and a significant increase in FOM. For the <80kg group, tin-filtration resulted in significantly noisier images but with no significant difference in CNR. For the >=80kg group, tin-filtration resulted in significantly higher CNR. There was no significant difference in subjective image quality when assessed by the radiologists in terms of diagnostic confidence for urolithiasis., CONCLUSION: Tin-filtration significantly reduces patient dose while maintaining diagnostic image quality of CTUs for patients with suspected urolithiasis.

LEARNING OBJECTIVE #2: Discuss the management of Waldenstrom macroglobulinemia. CASE: In 2019, an 87-year-old Caucasian male with a history of chronic back pain presented to his primary care doctor's office with a chief complaint of low back pain. In 2004, an X-ray of the lumbosacral spine revealed mild lumbar spondylosis. His back pain began after bending over to pick up his wife. He denied recent trauma, fevers, chills, intravenous drug use, unexplained weight loss, history of malignancy, saddle anesthesia, bowel or bladder incontinence or progressive weakness. He was referred to pain medicine for consideration of steroid injection. MRI lumbar spine was ordered which showed a pathologic compression fracture of L4 with abnormal bone marrow involvement of the left iliac wing. MRI cervical, thoracic spine and CT chest, abdomen and pelvis were ordered to work up malignancy. CT was without metastatic disease. Repeat MRI showed diffuse heterogeneous bone marrow signal concerning for an infiltrating process. The patient was referred to oncology clinic. His father passed away from lymphoma. Physical exam revealed a well appearing male without adenopathy or midline spinal tenderness. Labs showed WBC 7.2, Hb 15.1, platelet count 250, monocytes elevated to 1.0. IgM was elevated to 1,694 while IgG and IgA levels were decreased. 24-hour urine protein collection was negative. Bone marrow biopsy showed CD5 negative/CD10 negative B-cell lymphoproliferative disorder involving approximately 35% of the marrow cellularity. The differential included marrow involvement by a B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma such as lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma (favored by the presence of IgM monoclonal gammopathy) and marginal zone lymphoma. The MYD88 L265P mutation was negative. IMPACT/DISCUSSION: Waldenstrom macroglobulinemia is a rare clinicopathologic entity demonstrating bone marrow infiltration by lymphoplasmacytic cells and a serum IgM gammopathy. Elderly, white males are more commonly affected with an annual incidence of 3-4 persons per million. Symptoms are due to the infiltration of lymphoplasmacytic cells in the bone marrow and IgM gammopathy of the blood. Milder symptoms can be secondary to anemia and organomegaly, while more severe symptoms can be due to CNS involvement and hyperviscosity syndrome. Diagnosis is made by monoclonal IgM gammopathy and a bone marrow biopsy demonstrating greater than 10% infiltration by small lymphocytes with a typical immunophenotype. The differential diagnosis includes IgM MGUS, CLL, marginal zone lymphoma and mantle cell lymphoma. Asymptomatic patients are managed by observation alone while symptomatic patients are treated with chemotherapy.

The current work aims to prepare the solid self-nanoemulsifying granules (SSNEGs) of ondansetron hydrochloride (ONH) to enhance its oral bioavailability by improving its aqueous solubility and facilitating its absorption though lymphatic pathways. Preformulation studies including screening of excipients for solubility and pseudoternary phase diagrams suggested the suitability of Capmul MCM as lipid, Labrasol as surfactant, and Tween 20 as cosurfactant for preparation of self-emulsifying formulations. Preliminary composition of the SNEDDS formulations were selected from the phase diagrams and subjected to thermodynamic stability studies and dispersibility tests. The prepared liquid SNEDDS formulations were characterized for viscosity, refractive index, droplet size and zeta potential. The TEM study confirmed the formation of nanoemulsion following dilution of liquid SNEDDS. The optimized liquid SNEDDS were transformed into free flowing granules by adsorption on the porous carriers like Sylysia (350, 550, and 730) and Neusilin TM US2. Solid state characterization employing the FTIR, DSC and powder XRD studies indicated lack of any significant interaction of drug with the lipidic and emulsifying excipients, and porous carriers. In vitro drug release studies indicated faster solubilization of the drug by optimized SSNEGs (over 80% within 30 min) vis-a-vis the pure drug (only 35% within 30 min). In vivo pharmacokinetic studies in Wistar rats observed significant increase in C(max) (3.01-fold) and AUC (5.34-fold) using SSNEGs compared to pure drug, whereas no significant difference (p>0.1) was observed with the liquid SNEDDS. Thus, the present studies ratify the bioavailability enhancement potential of SSNEGs of ONH prepared using porous carriers. Copyright © 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",Excluded

Background: We previously described the feasibility of myocardial perfusion imaging (MPI) with nearly half the radiation dose using ordered-subset expectation maximization with resolution recovery (OSEM-RR) processing. This study sought to determine if the findings can be expanded to obese patients. Method(s): Fifty obese patients (>100 kg) referred for MPI underwent stress-rest or rest-stress studies with a half dose of Tc-99m sestamibi in a 1-day protocol using OSEM-RR processing. Image quality and clinical results were compared with matched patients (by age, sex, weight, presence/probability of coronary artery disease) evaluated with standard ""full-dose"" Tc-99m sestamibi, mostly in a 2-day protocol. Dose activities were adjusted individually by weight. Result(s): Mean Tc-99m activity was 33.4 +/- 13.9 mCi in the half-dose group and 60 +/- 10 mCi in the full-dose group (P <.0001). Respective mean effective doses per study were 10 +/- 4 and 18 +/- 3 mSv (P <.0001). Overall image quality was good-to-excellent in 94% of the half-dose group and 80% of the full-dose group (P <.045). There was no between-group difference in rate or size of ischemia or infarction, except for stress left ventricular ejection fraction. Conclusion(s): MPI with half the radiation dose is feasible in obese patients.

209,"Personal sun exposure and serum 25-hydroxy vitamin D concentrations. Solar ultraviolet-B radiation (UVB) is essential for epidermal vitamin D production. We aimed to quantitate the relationship between personal solar UV exposure and serum 25hydroxy vitamin D (25[OH]D) concentration. Blood was collected for 25(OH)D analysis in 207 South Australian adults aged 27-61 years. At the time of blood collection, each participant completed a questionnaire, which included a calendar for recall of sun exposure in the preceding 16 weeks. We examined the association between solar UV exposure and serum 25(OH)D graphically from smoothed scatter plots, and modeled it using multiple linear regression, with age, sex and body mass index as covariates. Estimated erythemal solar UV exposure in the 6 weeks before blood collection best predicted serum 25(OH)D concentrations. Serum 25(OH)D rose with increasing personal solar UV exposure to a maximum of about 89 nmol L(-1) at an estimated mean weekly solar erythemal UV exposure of about 1230 mJ cm(-2). The maximum was the same after accounting for clothing coverage and was reached at an estimated whole body equivalent exposure to ambient UV of ca 700 mJ cm(-2). These results suggest that an average maximum serum 25(OH)D of ca 89 nmol L(-1) is achieved from sun exposure in a healthy Australian adult population. Copyright © 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

2250,"Comparison of dual-axis rotational coronary angiography (XPERSWING) versus conventional technique in routine practice. INTRODUCTION AND OBJECTIVES: Coronary angiography is the gold standard for the study of coronary artery disease. This technique requires several orthogonal projections. Rotational angiography is a new technique which involves pre-set rotation of the X-ray tube around the patient and allows visualization of each coronary artery in different views, using a single contrast injection. The purpose of this study was to compare conventional coronary angiography (A) vs rotational angiography (B), focusing on radiation dose, amount of contrast administered, and total procedure time for both diagnostic and therapeutic percutaneous coronary interventions., METHODS: Prospective study of 104 consecutive patients undergoing coronary angiography who were randomized to one of these techniques., RESULTS: We found a significant reduction in the amount of contrast administered (A vs B, 93.1 [41.7] vs 50.9 [14.7] mL; P<.0001) and radiation exposure (27.6 [11.5] vs 18 [6.4] mGycm(2); P<.0001). A significant increase in total procedure time was noted in the rotational angiography arm. However, when only the last 50 patients were analyzed, we found no difference in procedure time between the groups, probably related to the learning curve of the operators. Angioplasty was performed in 29 patients in group A and 28 patients in group B. Contrast reduction was maintained in the rotational angiography group compared to the conventional technique (A vs B, 335.1 [192.1] vs 238.5 [114.4] mL; P=.02)., CONCLUSIONS: The rotational angiography technique leads to a significant decrease in radiation exposure and contrast dose administered for diagnostic procedures when compared to conventional coronary angiography. In patients who undergo percutaneous coronary intervention, contrast reduction remains significant. Copyright © 2011 Sociedad Espanola de Cardiologia. Published by Elsevier Espana.

843,"Effects on human skin of repetitive ultraviolet-A1 (UVA1) irradiation and visible light. Background: Ultraviolet radiation (UVR) has a variety of effects on human skin. Best known are the effects of UVB (290-320 nm) and UVA2 (320-340 nm), which cause DNA damage and increased risk of cancer. However, the effects of UVA1 (340-400 nm) have been not completely investigated. Method(s): The effects of repetitive low doses of UVA1 and visible light were studied in 12 healthy individuals. A part of the buttock was exposed to 20 J/cm2 UVA1 and another part to 126 J/cm2 of visible light three times a week for 4 weeks. Repeated punch biopsies were taken during the 4 weeks of treatment and also 2 weeks after the last irradiation. The avidin-biotin-immunoperoxidase technique was used to investigate the expression of p53, p21WAF, bcl-2, Ki67 and cyclin A. Result(s): By comparison to untreated skin, an increased expression of p53 but not p21WAF in keratinocytes was seen. The bcl-2 protein expression increased slightly after both UVA1 and visible light. An increased staining with Ki67 and cyclin A after UVA1 but not after visible light was observed as a sign of increased proliferation. Conclusion(s): These results suggest that suberythemal doses of UVA1 and even visible light may cause DNA damage.",Excluded
1993,"Utility of postoperative radiographs for cervical spine fusion: A comprehensive evaluation of operative technique, surgical indication, and duration since surgery. STUDY DESIGN.: A retrospective study. OBJECTIVE.: To assess the utility of postoperative radiographs in patients across a spectrum of cervical fusion procedures, surgical indication, and time since surgery. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA.: Postoperative radiographs are routinely obtained after cervical spine fusion despite lack of evidence supporting such practice. Studies assessing postoperative radiographical utility in the cervical spine have been limited. To date, no study has comprehensively evaluated the utility of obtaining such radiographs across multiple cervical fusion procedures. METHODS.: A total of 972 clinic notes from 301 patients during a 10-year period at a single institution were retrospectively reviewed. Patients in this study underwent an anterior cervical discectomy and fusion, anterior corpectomy and fusion, a combined anterior cervical discectomy and fusion and anterior corpectomy and fusion (hybrid), posterior spine fusion, or 360degree fusion. All postoperative clinic notes and radiographs were reviewed for abnormalities and changes in treatment course. It was determined whether an abnormal radiograph alone led to a change in treatment course among the various operative techniques, surgical indication, or time since surgery. RESULTS.: No statistical significant difference in radiograph utility between anterior cervical discectomy and fusion (0 changes in treatment course due to radiograph alone out of 332 clinic notes), anterior corpectomy and fusion (0 of 140), hybrid procedure (1 of 72), posterior spine fusion (5 of 357), and 360degree fusion (0 of 71) was found. Surgical indication (trauma vs. degeneration) and duration from surgery yielded no statistical significant difference in radiograph utility. The overall sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values of radiographs were 33.8%, 87.6%, 19.0%, and 93.9%, respectively. CONCLUSION.: Regardless of operative techniques performed, surgical indication, and time since surgery, routine postoperative radiographs provide low utility in guiding treatment course in asymptomatic patients. Although radiographs may provide important diagnostic utility in certain individual cases, the results of this study provide further evidence that radiographs should not be considered routine during postoperative visits, thus minimizing unnecessary radiation exposure and medical costs.

1881,"Twice-daily Thoracic Radiotherapy for Limited-stage Small-cell Lung Cancer Does Not Increase the Incidence of Acute Severe Esophagitis. PURPOSE: Acute esophagitis is common after thoracic radiation therapy (TRT) given with chemotherapy for limited-stage small-cell lung cancer (LS SCLC). Although twice-daily TRT to 45 Gy in 30 fractions is considered standard, some clinicians are reluctant to use this schedule because of its perceived impracticality and risk of severe esophagitis. We reviewed a single-institution experience with severe (grade >= 3) esophagitis after TRT with chemotherapy for LS SCLC., PATIENTS AND METHODS: A total of 504 patients were identified as having received TRT (>=45 Gy) with platinum-containing chemotherapy for LS SCLC at MD Anderson Cancer Center in 1987 through 2012. Patients with complete or good partial response were offered prophylactic cranial irradiation. Esophagitis was scored retrospectively with the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events, V3.0. Clinical variables were analyzed for possible association with acute grade >= 3 esophagitis., RESULTS: At a median follow-up time of 23.9 months (range, 1.2-240.8 months), 103 (20%) patients had experienced grade >= 3 esophagitis. In univariate analysis, TRT dose >= 60 Gy was the only factor associated with severe esophagitis (odds ratio [OR], 1.84; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.02-3.30; P = .043); use of twice-daily TRT was not (OR, 0.96; 95% CI, 0.61-1.52; P = .867). The significance of TRT to >= 60 Gy was maintained in multivariate Cox regression analysis adjusted for tumor size (OR, 1.91; 95% CI, 1.05-3.46; P = .034)., CONCLUSIONS: TRT to >= 60 Gy predicted acute severe esophagitis, but twice-daily fractionation did not. Standard-dose 45-Gy twice-daily TRT should not be avoided for fear of severe esophagitis. Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.",Excluded

3341,"Value of lung perfusion in stage III non-small cell lung cancer patients treated with three dimensional conformal radiotherapy. Objective: To investigate the value of lung perfusion single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) scans in patients with stage III non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) treated with three dimensional conformal radiotherapy (3DCRT). Method(s): Eight patients with stage III NSCLC who were candidated for 3DCRT were enrolled. All the patients had PET-CT scans and SPECT scans. The imagings were accurately co-registered in the planning system. The PET-CT images were used to define the gross tumor volume, and the SPECT images were used to define a volume of perfused ""functioning"" lung (FL). The planning objective was to minimize the dose to FL. Statistical analysis was made for the difference between the two sets of 3DCRT plans. Result(s): After 3DCRT was optimized, both the percentage of whole lung volume received dose >=xGy (WLVx) and the percentage of functional lung volume received dose >=xGy (FLVx) were decreased. However, the FLVx was decreased significantly. There were significant differences in WLV10, WLV15, WLV20, WLV25, WLV30 and FLV10, FLV15, FLV20, FLV25, FLV30 between before and after the 3DCRT was optimized (P=0.001, 0.002, 0.014, 0.046, 0.017 and 0.000, 0.000, 0.004, 0.027, 0.023).

Exposure to SMF (100-220 mT, 15-40 T/m for 1h) did not affect the threshold for detecting auditory brainstem responses. Serial seizures elevated the hearing threshold at some frequencies, but there was no difference between SMF-exposed and unexposed control mice. EEG changes were recorded during audiogenic seizures. Pretreatment with SMF prolonged seizure latency in response to stimulation with white noise of increasing intensity from 74 to 102 dBA (1 min interval between 2 and 4 dBA increments) without significant effects on seizure severity. Gender-related differences were not statistically significant. Stimulation with 10 min sound steps revealed prolongation of latency and reduction of seizure severity in SMF-exposed, but not unexposed, mice. Pretreatment with phenytoin (5 mg/kg) in combination with SMF had significantly greater effects on seizure latency and severity than either pretreatment alone.

1528,"Are low ultraviolet B and vitamin D associated with higher incidence of multiple myeloma?. Background The purpose of this study was to determine whether an inverse association exists between latitude, solar ultraviolet B (UVB) irradiance, and incidence rates of multiple myeloma.Methods Associations of latitude and UVB irradiance with age-standardized incidence rates of multiple myeloma were analyzed for 175 countries while controlling for sex-specific obesity prevalence, cigarette consumption, and alcohol consumption using multiple linear regression.Results Incidence rates of multiple myeloma were greater at higher latitudes (R2 for latitude for males = 0.31, p < 0.0001; females R2 = 0.27, p < 0.0001). In regression models for males (R2 = 0.62, p < 0.0001) and females (R2 = 0.51, p < 0.0001), UVB irradiance was independently inversely associated with incidence rates.Conclusions Age-adjusted incidence rates of multiple myeloma were higher in countries with lower solar UVB irradiance.

Our aim was to describe both sun exposure and sun protection behaviour in a series of patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), and to study their potential association with vitaminD concentration., PATIENTS AND METHODS: A cross sectional, observational study. The clinical-demographic variables were obtained via clinical interviews and medical history review. The sunlight exposure assessment was carried out using the Sun Exposure Questionnaire and the concentration of 25-hydroxy vitaminD (25OHD) was measured by an electro-chemiluminescence immunoassay. Questionnaires were conducted on quality of life, physical activity, weekly vitaminD intake and sun protection behaviour., RESULTS: 149 patients were included. In 69% of patients, deficient or insufficient 25OHD values were recorded. 67% showed low sun exposure. A modest significant correlation was observed between the total score of the solar exposure questionnaire and the 25OHD concentration in the complete series (r=0.226, P=.006) and in the summer (r=0.274, P=.01). The sun protection behaviour questionnaire score did not influence the 25OHD concentration. In the multivariate analysis, only the presence of clinical activity was associated with low sun exposure (OR=3.23)., DISCUSSION: Sun exposure according to the questionnaire used was low, was associated with the presence of clinical activity and was weakly correlated with serum 25OHD concentration.

2988,"Use of electrocardiogram to position right atrial catheters during surgery. OBJECTIVE: This study evaluated the accuracy of placing right atrial catheters using an electrocardiographic (ECG) technique., SUMMARY BACKGROUND DATA: Placement of right atrial catheters for vascular access is a common operative procedure. Accurate placement is essential for proper function. Previous placement techniques have used fluoroscopy, which is both time consuming and hazardous., METHODS: The accuracy of placement of 1236 right atrial catheters using an ECG technique was compared to placement of 586 catheters using fluoroscopy between March 1991 and November 1995. In the ECG technique, the catheter was flushed with sodium bicarbonate. A sterile left-leg ECG lead was attached to the catheter with the other ECG leads applied normally. On advancing the catheter through the superior vena cava, the P-wave amplitude (lead II) increased in negative deflection until greater than the QRS complex. Passing the sinoatrial node, the P-wave developed an initial positive then negative deflection. The catheter was positioned so the P-wave was biphasic, representing a position midway between the sinoatrial and atrioventricular nodes. For the fluoroscopic technique, catheters were positioned under direct observation just within the atrium estimated from cardiac contour. Use of contrast was optional if atrial anatomy was unclear., RESULTS: Postoperative portable chest x-rays showed the ECG method to position the catheter tip within the right atrium just as accurately (average, 1.9 +/- 1.3 cm) as with the use of fluoroscopy (average, 1.1 +/- 1.6 cm). The ECG method eliminated an average of 20 seconds of radiation exposure, an average of 3.0 minutes operating room time (p < 0.04), avoided all risks of contrast dye, and saved $279.10 per case., CONCLUSIONS: The ECG method is a satisfactory alternative to that of fluoroscopy for placement of long-term central venous catheters into the right atrium.",Excluded

Endovascular embolization is in most cases the first line of treatment but does not always achieve cure. Gamma Knife (GK) radiosurgery represents an alternative treatment option, and the purpose of this study was to further evaluate its utility. Method(s): We reviewed all cases of DAVF treated between 2009 and 2016 at our institution with GK radiosurgery independently, or following failed/refused endovascular or surgical management. Patients' clinical files, radiological images, catheter angiograms, and surgical DAVF disconnection reports were retrospectively reviewed. Result(s): Sixteen DAVF (14 patients) treated by GK radiosurgery were identified. Eleven fistulae were aggressive and five were benign. Marginal doses ranged from 15 to 25 Gy. Target volumes ranged from 0.04 to 4.47 cm3. In all symptomatic patients, GK treatment resulted in symptom palliation. In 13/15 lesions, cure of symptoms (86.0%) was reported. One lesion was asymptomatic. Angiographic cure was achieved in eight cases (50%), small residual DAVF occurred in four, and four were unchanged. One patient developed headache that resolved at one year. No hemorrhage occurred during the follow-up period. There was no significant association between Borden type and cure rate. Prior failed endovascular treatment and small target volume were associated with lower rates of cure. Conclusion(s): Stereotactic radiosurgery is viable treatment for DAVF. It is very effective in palliating symptoms as a de novo approach or adjunctive to endovascular therapy. In our experience it is only somewhat effective in achieving complete angiographic cure.Copyright © The Author(s) 2016.",Excluded
2186,"Use of handheld X-ray fluorescence as a non-invasive method to distinguish between Asian and African elephant tusks. We describe the use of handheld X-ray fluorescence, for elephant tusk species identification. Asian (n = 72) and African (n = 85) elephant tusks were scanned and we utilized the species differences in elemental composition to develop a functional model differentiating between species with high precision. Spatially, the majority of measured elements (n = 26) exhibited a homogeneous distribution in cross-section, but a more heterologous pattern in the longitudinal direction. Twenty-one of twenty four elements differed between Asian and African samples. Data were subjected to hierarchical cluster analysis followed by a stepwise discriminant analysis, which identified elements for the functional equation. The best equation consisted of ratios of Si, S, Cl, Ti, Mn, Ag, Sb and W, with Zr as the denominator. Next, Bayesian binary regression model analysis was conducted to predict the probability that a tusk would be of African origin. A cut-off value was established to improve discrimination. This Bayesian hybrid classification model was then validated by scanning an additional 30 Asian and 41 African tusks, which showed high accuracy (94%) and precision (95%) rates. We conclude that handheld XRF is an accurate, non-invasive method to discriminate origin of elephant tusks provides rapid results applicable to use in the field.",Excluded
1714,"A guide to mammography and other breast imaging procedures. Mammographic studies are performed for both diagnosis of breast disease and screening for cancer. Diagnostic mammography can demonstrate the presence of breast cancer in a symptomatic patient and more specifically, the size, location and extent of tumor. Mammographic screening involves examination of asymptomatic women in an attempt to detect breast cancer before it grows large enough to be palpable. The use of diagnostic mammography is well accepted due to the compelling clinical need for the information provided. The implementation of a mammographic screening program depends upon: (1) indication of a favorable benefit/risk ratio for the population being screened; (2) availability of suitably trained radiologists, medical physicists, and technologists and appropriate mammographic equipment subject to a vigorous QA program; and (3) acceptably low cost. Breast anatomy and function must be understood (Section 2) in order to design and utilize the mammographie techniques which will effectively detect and demonstrate breast cancer. The technique which is employed for the preponderance of mammography examinations is screen-film mammography with a grid. Good screen-film mammography requires dedicated equipment which can provide an appropriate soft x-ray beam (proper choice of operating potential, target, filter, window, HVL) (Section 3), proper compression, a target-film distance of suitable length for the given focal-spot size, and provision for vertical adjustment and mechanical rotation of the tube and image-receptor assembly for proper positioning (Section 2). The two views, which are recommended, are the CC and the MLO view (Section 2) which allow more visualization of the posterior glandular tissues, particularly in the auxiliary tail than a lateral view. The lateral view should also be employed whenever a nonpalpable lesion is discovered, in order to provide accurate three-dimensional localization. Screen-film mammography should be performed by a technologist who has had special training in compression and positioning techniques for the standard and special views used for mammography (ACR, 1999). Only an intensifying screen designed specifically for mammography should be used in combination with a suitable single-emulsion film (Section 3). The combination should be placed in low-absorption cassettes designed for mammography. There are many factors which affect image quality (Section 4). The three major components of image quality are contrast, sharpness and noise. Image quality can be optimized by suitable adjustment of the x-ray spectrum (operating potential, filtration, target material), breast compression, grids, imaging geometry (small focal spot, long target-film distance), choice of screens and films, and optimization of film-processing techniques. Image quality may be checked with suitable phantoms. Section 4 provides information to allow facilities to determine whether the particular combination of x-ray machine, compression devices, technique factors and image receptors in current use, or under consideration for use, for mammography will provide optimum image quality. A major objective of mammography dosimetry is to provide relevant information so that potential radiation risks from alternative techniques may be compared. For this purpose a single-valued dose"" per view for each technique, which corresponds reasonably well to the resulting carcinogenic potential, should be determined. This task involves consideration of tissue vulnerability to radiation effects, anatomy, technique and dosimetry. In addition, a unique dose value for each technique requires that the dose be determined for a fixed-reference breast composition with breast thickness stated. Simple computational models of the breast have been developed for estimation of mammographic dose. Several assumptions are implicit in these models relating to radiation risk, breast anatomy, and technique (Section 5). Three specific points are relevant to radiation risk: (1) breast glandular tissue is most vulnerable as compared with adipose, skin and areo ar tissues; (2) an average breast dose (namely, the mean glandular dose), rather than a maximum dose, is most useful in characterizing risk of carcinogenesis consistent with a linear dose-response relationship; and (3) the population of primary interest is women 40 y and older since younger women are likely to receive only diagnostic and baseline studies. This assumption that the population of primary interest is women 40 y and older limits application of the computational models to the older on average, more adipose breast, which helps justify certain simplifying assumptions. A major technique variable is the degree of compression employed. Firm compression, which is assumed in dose computations, greatly distorts the breast anatomy, making more rectangular the sagittal and transverse cross-sections of the volume that includes the glandular tissue. This greatly simplifies the breast geometry and makes the computational models more appropriate than otherwise would be the case (Section 5). The mean glandular dose (D<inf>g</inf>) meets the stated requirements outlined above. The computational model used in this Report for D<inf>g</inf> assumes that 0.5 cm thick adipose layers enclose a central ""glandular tissue"" containing a uniform mix of glandular and adipose tissues in roughly equal amounts. The procedure for estimating mean glandular dose for a specific population of patients is described in Table 4.3 (Approach II). A basic requirement for maintaining optimum image quality in mammography is implementation of a suitable QA program (Section 6). Each of the items contributing to image quality must be evaluated on a regular basis. The quality administration program (medical audit) evaluates the appropriateness and accuracy of image interpretation (Section 6.3). The benefit from screening by mammography and physical examination in the form of decreased breast cancer mortality has long been accepted for women above age 50 on the basis of a randomized trial (the HIP study, see Section 7), which indicated that the contribution of mammography to decreased breast cancer mortality was significant in older women. The randomized clinical trials of mammographic screening have not demonstrated a benefit for women age 40 to 49, within the first 7 y of starting screening. Those trials for which 10 or more years of follow-up is available, show evidence of a 23 percent benefit in reducing mortality. Although this reduction is smaller than that observed for older women, it is statistically significant and therefore, one can reject the possibility that this may have happened by chance. Compared with mammography practiced in the previous randomized trials, high-quality modern mammography could result in increased benefit. Even a very small benefit (e.g., one percent) more than offsets any risk of radiation-induced breast cancer. The benefit versus risk will be substantial, if analysis of ongoing screening experience demonstrates a reduction in breast cancer mortality rate of 30 percent or more. Among the various imaging methods designed to evaluate the breast for cancer, mammography is the most accurate and most widely used. It has gained clinical acceptance primarily because of its ability to detect a cancer before the tumor mass becomes large enough to be palpable, thereby permitting ""early"" diagnosis. It has also been proven an invaluable tool to distinguish benign from malignant lesions and can facilitate prompt biopsy of cancers, while encouraging clinical observation (rather than biopsy) of many benign masses. Other breast imaging methods have, thus far, been considered less successful; these include thermography, transillumination, ultrasonography, and MRI and MRS all of which do not utilize ionizing radiation. Computed tomography (Section 8.4) and digital mammography (Section 3.3) which use x rays, and therefore involve the potential risk of mammary carcinogenesis are being subjected to clinical investigation to determine their role in breast cancer diagnosis. Explanations of the principles of operation, a chronology of developments, an an extensive discussion of the limitations of each of these methods is contained in Sections 3.3 and 8.4.""",Excluded
3601,"The interobserver reliability of the diagnosis and classification of scaphoid fractures using high-resolution peripheral quantitative CT. Aims Besides conventional radiographs, the use of MRI, CT, and bone scintigraphy is frequent in the diagnosis of a fracture of the scaphoid. However, which techniques give the best results remain unknown. The investigation of a new imaging technique initially requires an analysis of its precision. The primary aim of this study was to investigate the interobserver agreement of high-resolution peripheral quantitative CT (HR-pQCT) in the diagnosis of a scaphoid fracture. A secondary aim was to investigate the interobserver agreement for the presence of other fractures and for the classification of scaphoid fracture. Methods Two radiologists and two orthopaedic trauma surgeons evaluated HR-pQCT scans of 31 patients with a clinically-suspected scaphoid fracture. The observers were asked to determine the presence of a scaphoid or other fracture and to classify the scaphoid fracture based on the Herbert classification system. Fleiss kappa statistics were used to calculate the interobserver agreement for the diagnosis of a fracture. Intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs) were used to assess the agreement for the classification of scaphoid fracture. Results A total of nine (29%) scaphoid fractures and 12 (39%) other fractures were diagnosed in 20 patients (65%) using HR-pQCT across the four observers. The interobserver agreement was 91% for the identification of a scaphoid fracture (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.76 to 1.00) and 80% for other fractures (95% CI 0.72 to 0.87). The mean ICC for the classification of a scaphoid fracture in the seven patients diagnosed with scaphoid fracture by all four observers was 73% (95% CI 0.42 to 0.94).

Background: The use of cervical interfacet spacers (CISs) to augment stability and provide solid arthrodesis at the atlantoaxial joint has not been studied in detail. The aim of this work is to report the outcomes with the use of machined allograft CISs at C1-2. Method(s): A retrospective review of 19 patients who underwent an atlantoaxial fusion with the use of CISs was performed. All patients had instability documented with flexion and extension lateral radiographs. This instability was due to trauma, degenerative stenosis, symptomatic C1-2 arthropathy, and os odontoideum. Clinical and radiological outcomes were assessed. Fusion was determined based on a lack of hardware failure, absence of motion on flexion and extension plain X-ray films, and presence of bridging trabecular bone which was most often demonstrated by a computed tomography. Result(s): The mean age was 69.1 +/- 12.9 years. Eight patients had traumatic fractures, six patients had degenerative stenosis, two patients had C2 neuralgia due to C1-2 arthropathy, two patients had C1-2 ligamentous subluxation, and one patient had an unstable os odontoideum. The occiput or subaxial spine was included in the arthrodesis in 10 patients. Rib autograft was utilized in most patients. No patient had postoperative neurological worsening, malposition of hardware, or vertebral artery injury and there were no mortalities. The fusion rate was 95%.

Patients with polymorphic light eruption (PLE) demonstrate abnormal responses to ultraviolet-radiation suggestive of an immune response to an ultraviolet-radiation-induced antigen. We investigated whether PLE patients (n=22) were resistant to ultraviolet-radiation-induced immunosuppression compared to skin-type, aged-matched controls (n=23). Groups of patients and controls (six subjects per group) received a single dose of solar-simulated ultraviolet-radiation of either 0, 0.6, 1 or 2 minimal erythema doses (MED). Erythema was quantified using a reflectance meter and all volunteers were sensitised on the irradiated site with dinitrochlorobenzene.

The objective of the ProActive Lung Cancer Detection (PALCAD) study was to evaluate whether low dose chest computed tomographic scanning (LDCCT) can detect early stage asymptomatic lung cancer in a high risk urban population., METHODS: Four hundred and forty nine subjects of median age 55 years (range 50-74) with a median pack year smoking history of 45 years (range 10-160), with no previous cancer history and medically fit to undergo thoracic surgery were recruited. After informed consent, LDCCT was performed on all subjects. Non-calcified nodules (NCNs) of >/=10 mm in diameter were referred for biopsy. Follow up with interval LDCCT at 6, 12 and 24 months to exclude growth was recommended for NCNs <10 mm in diameter., RESULTS: Six (1.3%) NCNs of >/=10 mm were detected of which one (0.23%) had non-small cell lung cancer stage 1; 145 NCNs of <10 mm were detected in 87 (19.4%) subjects. Mediastinal masses were detected in three subjects (0.7%)-one small cell lung cancer and two benign duplication cysts. Incidental pathology was noted in 276 patients (61.5%), most commonly emphysema and coronary artery calcification., CONCLUSION: The prevalence of resectable lung cancer detected by LDCCT at baseline screening was low at 0.23%, but there was a high rate of significant incidental pathology.",Excluded
3565,"Molecular model T6: C60 bulk-heterojunction solar cells. Organic photovoltaic devices offer a large technological potential as a renewable source of electrical energy because of their low cost and ease of processing. For the last few years, the interest in such devices has grown rapidly, allowing multiplication of the solar conversion efficiency by 5 within about 10 years. The highest conversion efficiency obtained is now close to 5% with a spin-coated polythiophene-fullerene blend. For a better understanding of those polymer blend systems, we have fabricated a coevaporated solar cell from model molecules. The molecular blend was composed of sexithiophene (, -dihexylsexithiophene, T6) as a donor and fullerene C60 as an acceptor. The influence of the T6: C60 proportion was studied for an active layer of 100 nm thickness. The conversion efficiency obtained with the optimal proportion of T6: C60 (40-60) is 0.7%. Reverse bias annealing effect was studied by measuring the current-voltage characteristics after each postprocessing step. The conversion efficiency reached 1% but still remained much less than for the polymer bulk heterojunction. This major difference may come from the spontaneous phase separation which takes place in polymers to form an interpenetrated network. 2006 American Vacuum Society.",Excluded

Results from the devenir des spondyloarthropathies indifferenciEes rEcentes (DESIR) cohort. Background Spondylarthritis (SPA) spectrum refers to a variety of skeletal and extra-articular inflammatory manifestations that may combine differently among patients. Objectives To examine whether SPA disease manifestations at baseline would combine according to an ordered or random pattern in patients with early inflammatory low back pain (IBP) and suggestive of SPA. Methods Baseline clinical and demographic characteristics, as well as imaging (i.e. pelvic X-rays, pelvic MRI and peripheral entheses ultrasound) and biological data (including HLA-B27) of patients included in the French multicenter DESIR cohort of early (<3 yrs duration) IBP suggestive of SPA were analysed by multiple correspondence analysis in order to graphically assess the association between the studied manifestations. Several methods of cluster analysis using those variables were then performed to identify subgroups of patients with similar characteristics. Results Seven hundred and eight patients were included into the Cohort. Among the 700 analysed patients cluster analysis allowed us to classify 688 patients in 3 major groups (table 1). Cluster A contained a majority of men, with predominant isolated axial manifestations, and higher frequency of uveitis and positivity of HLA-B27. Cluster B predominantly consisted of women, with higher frequency of peripheral signs (including vascularisation at entheses by power Doppler ultrasound (PDUS)), psoriasis and younger onset of disease symptoms. Cluster C was composed by patients with predominant axial symptoms, equal distribution of sex, highest presence of pelvic X-rays and MRI positivity, and higher prevalence of HLA-B27 positivity. (Table presented) Conclusions Cluster analysis of SPA manifestations among patients with early IBP allowed us to clearly identify at baseline 3 different groups of clinical phenotypes. Ongoing follow up will allow to determine whether these clusters may correspond to different severity patterns.",Excluded
3552,"The upper esophageal sphincter is not round: a pilot study evaluating a novel, physiology-based approach to upper esophageal sphincter dilation. OBJECTIVES: Recent basic science investigations have suggested that the upper esophageal sphincter (UES), in cross section, is not round, but that it more closely approximates a kidney shape. Dilation with simultaneous use of two cylindrical dilators provides a novel, physiology-based approach to UES distention. We evaluated the initial safety and efficacy of UES dilation with simultaneous use of two controlled radial expansion balloon dilators., METHODS: Using a computerized database, we reviewed the charts of all persons who underwent UES dilation with simultaneous use of two radial expansion balloon dilators between December 1, 2011, and March 15, 2012. Information regarding patient demographics, indications, technique, and complications was abstracted. Self-reported swallowing impairment was assessed with the validated 10-item Eating Assessment Tool (EAT-10)., RESULTS: Ten individuals underwent simultaneous dilation with two dilators. Their mean age was 65 years (SD, 14 years), and 7 (70%) of them were male. The indications for dilation were radiation-induced UES stenosis (50%), cricopharyngeus muscle dysfunction (30%), upper esophageal web (10%), and anastomotic stricture (10%). After the double-balloon dilation, no complications were reported. The mean EAT-10 score improved significantly, from 34.3 (SD, 13.5) to 16.7 (SD, 8.4), after the simultaneous dilation (p = 0.003)., CONCLUSIONS: Pilot data suggest that simultaneous dilation of the UES with two controlled radial expansion balloon dilators is feasible, safe, and effective. Future investigation is necessary to confirm the safety of this technique in a larger cohort and to use objective measures of efficacy to compare the technique to conventional dilation with a single dilator.",Excluded

PURPOSE: The aim of this study was to evaluate the impact of a reduced tube potential (100 kVp) for non-enhanced abdominal low-dose CT on radiation dose and image quality (IQ) in the detection of body packing., METHODS: This retrospective study was approved by the local research ethics committee of our clinic. From March 2012 to July 2014, 99 subjects were referred to our institute with suspected body packing. 50 CT scans were performed using a 120 kVp protocol (group A), and 49 CTs were performed using a low-dose protocol with a tube voltage of 100 kVp (group B). Subjective and objective IQ were assessed. DLP and CTDIvol were analyzed., RESULTS: All examinations were of diagnostic IQ. Objective IQ was not significantly different between the 120 kVp and 100 kVp protocol. Mean density of solid and liquid body packets was 210 +/- 60.2 HU at 120 kVp and 250.6 +/- 29.7 HU at 100 kVp. Radiation dose was significantly lower in group B as compared to group A (p < 0.05). In group A, body packs were detected in 16 (32%) of the 50 patients. In group B, packets were observed in 15 (31%) of 49 patients. Laboratory analysis detected cocaine in all smuggled body packs., CONCLUSIONS: Low-tube voltage 100 kVp MDCT with automated tube current modulation in screening of illegal drugs leads to a diagnostic IQ and significant dose reduction compared to 120 kVp low-tube voltage protocols. Despite lower radiation dose, liquid and solid cocaine containers retain high attenuation and are easily detected.",Excluded
436,"Dentists' use of digital radiographic techniques: Part I - intraoral X-ray: a questionnaire study of Swedish dentists. OBJECTIVE: The present study aims to gain knowledge about the dentist's use and choice of digital intraoral imaging methods., MATERIALS AND METHODS: A questionnaire sent to 2481 dentists within the Swedish Dental Society contained questions about the type of X-ray technique used, problems experienced with digital radiography, and reasons for choosing digital technology, and about indications, clinic size and type of service. Response rate was 53%., RESULTS: Ninety-eight percent of the dentists had made the transition to digital radiography; only 2% used film technique, and solid-state detector (SSD) was the most used digital technique. More years in service decreases the likelihood of applying individual indications for performing a full mouth examination. More retakes were done with SSDs compared to storage phosphor plates. Reasons for choosing digital techniques were that work was easier and communication with the patients improved. However, dentists also experienced problems with digital techniques, such as exposure and projection errors and inadequate image quality. The Swedish Radiation Safety Authority states that all radiological examinations should be justified, something not always followed., CONCLUSIONS: This study showed that 98% of the respondents, Swedish dentists within the Swedish Dental Society, used digital techniques, and the most used was the solid-state technique.",Excluded
358,"Cutaneous viral infections associated with ultraviolet radiation exposure. The complex interplay between ultraviolet radiation (UVR) and cutaneous viral infections in the context of cancer etiology is challenging to unravel, given the limited information on the independent association between UVR and cutaneous viral infections. Using multiple biomarkers of infection with 24 types of cutaneous human papillomavirus (HPV) and 4 types of polyomaviruses (HPyV), we investigated cross-sectional associations with recent UVR exposure, using skin pigmentation measured by spectrophotometer. Age- and sex-adjusted associations between UVR and viral seropositivity, viral DNA present in eyebrow hairs (EBH) and skin swabs (SSW) were estimated using logistic regression. Beta-HPV seropositivity was associated with viral DNA positivity in EBH (OR = 1.40, 95% CI = 1.05-1.88) and SSW (OR = 1.86, 95% CI = 1.25-2.74). Similar associations were observed for Merkel cell polyomavirus. Participants in the highest tertile of UVR exposure were more likely to be seropositive for beta-HPV (OR = 1.81, 95% CI = 1.16-2.38), and have beta-HPV DNA in EBH (OR = 1.57, 95% CI = 1.06-2.33) and SSW (OR = 2.22, 95% CI = 1.25-3.96), compared to participants with the lowest tertile of UVR exposure. UVR exposure was positively associated with three different markers of beta-HPV infection. Therefore, future studies of HPV associated KC development should address more directly the role of HPV and UVR exposure as potential co-carcinogens.Copyright © 2020 The Authors.

1698,"Estimation of skeletal muscle mass by dual-energy X-ray absorptionmetry appendicular lean soft mass in chinese adult. Objective We studied whether total body skeletal muscle (SM) mass could be accurately estimated from appendicular lean soft tissue (ALST) mass measured by dual-energy X-ray absorptionmetry (DXA), and investigated the validity of equations of prediction reported previously and derived from the data of the present study. (Table Presented) Methods We measured body composition by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and DXA in 194 Chinese stratified for sex, age and body mass index. The equation of prediction was generated by linear regression. The agreement between measured and predicted SM mass was assessed by the use of intraclass correlation analysis, paired t test, Bland-Altman plot. Results The total body SM mass measured by MRI (18.1 +/- 4.8 kg) was closely correlated with ALST mass (19.4 +/- 4.7 kg), with a correlation coefficient of 0.95, 0.84 and 0.89 in all subjects, men and women, respectively. If the previously published equations were used, the difference of SM mass measured by MRI and estimated from ALST was 3.37 +/- 1.75 kg and 3.25 +/- 1.70 kg in the absence and presence of age in the equation, respectively. On the basis of our own data, we generated 2 equations without or with age: SM = 0.98*ALST-0.99 (R2 = 0.91, P < 0.0001) and SM = 0.97* ALST-0.03*Age 0.66 (R2 = 0.92, P < 0.0001). By the application of these equations, the difference between measured and estimated SM mass decreased to -0.05 +/- 1.46 kg and -0.03 +/- 1.39 kg, respectively. (Figure Presented) Conclusions Estimation of SM mass by ALST is plausible, but requires population-specific equations of prediction. Our equations should be validated in other studies in Chinese.",Excluded
3139,"Selecting the best noninvasive imaging test to guide treatment after an inconclusive exercise test. Opinion statement: The first step towards approaching a patient with an inconclusive stress test is to identify the initial reason why a stress test was ordered and examine what factors led to inconclusive test results. Next, it is important to ask whether the patient will benefit from further testing, as not all patients with inconclusive test results require additional testing. In patients who are at low-to-intermediate risk, it may be useful to perform coronary CT angiography (CTA) to exclude the presence of obstructive coronary atherosclerosis. Among individuals with no prior history of coronary artery disease, a possible advantage of CTA is that if subclinical atherosclerosis is identified, intensification of lifestyle interventions, and often pharmacotherapy, should be advocated. On the other hand, in high-risk patients or individuals that already have coronary artery disease, the primary objective is to quantify the presence and magnitude of ischemia in order to define the potential role of coronary revascularization procedures. This can be achieved by myocardial perfusion imaging using nuclear imaging or cardiac MRI. Alternatively, a functional evaluation to identify stress-induced wall motion abnormalities using stress echocardiography or MRI can be obtained. In selecting which test to obtain, it is important to understand the strengths and limitations of different imaging tests and to consider patient factors (e.g., body habitus) that may influence the accuracy of various tests. In addition, physicians should consider whether there are any other clinical questions that require imaging. For instance, cardiac MRI may be used to evaluate for infiltrative myocardial disease or pericardial disease whereas cardiac CT can evaluate for lung pathology or diseases of the aorta. Finally, any decision regarding what type of additional testing to obtain should also be based on knowing the local expertise and availability of various testing options. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.",Excluded
2961,"Multimodal treatment for T1-2 supraglottic cancer: The impact of tumor location. Aim: To examine the outcome and prognostic factors after multimodal treatment of T1-2 supraglottic cancer. Patients and Methods: We analyzed 49 patients with T1-2 supraglottic cancer who received multimodal treatment between 1990 and 2011. Their age range was 43-86 years (median=66 years). Fifteen patients had a T1 tumor and 34 had a T2 tumor (40 N0, 3 N1, 4 N2, and 2 N3). Debulking using transoral laser excision was employed in 25 patients. Neck dissection was performed in four patients. Chemotherapy was administered to 29 patients: intra-arterial infusion in four and systemic infusion in 25. Radiotherapy was administered at a median dose of 64.8 Gy (range=30-70 Gy) with once- or twice-daily fractionation. Median follow-up time was 60 months (range=12-153 months). Result(s): Two patients interrupted radiotherapy because of a poor response at 30 Gy (T2N2) and 49.9 Gy (T2N0). They underwent total laryngectomy and were still alive without any evidence of cancer 48 and 28 months after treatment, respectively. The other 47 patients (96%) had a complete local response to treatment. Locoregional failure was observed in six tumor sites, and one patient had simultaneous locoregional recurrence. The 5-year local control, disease-free, overall survival, and laryngeal preservation rates were 82%, 74%, 82%, and 90%, respectively. The location of a primary tumor within the supraglottis (epilarynx or elsewhere) was identified as the only factor predictive of progression-free survival by univariate and multivariate analyses (p=0.04). Acute adverse reactions of grade 3 or more were: one grade 3 laryngeal edema, one grade 3 dyspnea, and one grade 5 hematological toxicity (disseminated intravascular coagulation). Among late adverse events, one grade 1, one grade 2 hoarseness, and grade 3 laryngeal necrosis were observed. Conclusion(s): Multimodal radiotherapy produced a good outcome. Localization of the tumor in the epilarynx was associated with a better progression-free survival rate than that in the other parts of the supraglottis.Copyright © 2014, International Institute of Anticancer Research.

Background: Accurate assessment of glenoid inclination is of interest for a variety of conditions and procedures. The purpose of this study was to develop an accurate and reproducible measurement for glenoid inclination on standardized anterior-posterior (AP) radiographs and on computed tomography (CT) images. Material(s) and Method(s): Three consistently identifiable angles were defined: Angle alpha by line AB connecting the superior and inferior glenoid tubercle (glenoid fossa) and the line identifying the scapular spine; angle beta by line AB and the floor of the supraspinatus fossa; angle gamma by line AB and the lateral margin of the scapula. Experimental study: these 3 angles were measured in function of the scapular position to test their resistance to rotation. Conventional AP radiographs and CT scans were acquired in extension/flexion and internal/external rotation in a range up to +/-40degree. Clinical study: the inter-rater reliability of all angles was assessed on AP radiographs and CT scans of 60 patients (30 with proximal humeral fractures, 30 with osteoarthritis) by 2 independent observers. Result(s): The experimental study showed that angle alpha and beta have a resistance to rotation of up to +/-20degree. The deviation from neutral position was not more than +/-10degree. The results for the inter-rater reliability analyzed by Bland-Altman plots for the angle beta fracture group were (mean +/- standard deviation) -0.1 +/- 4.2 for radiographs and -0.3 +/- 3.3 for CT scans; and for the osteoarthritis group were -1.2 +/- 3.8 for radiographs and -3.0 +/- 3.6 for CT scans. Conclusion(s): Angle beta is the most reproducible measurement for glenoid inclination on conventional AP radiographs, providing a resistance to positional variability of the scapula and a good inter-rater reliability. © 2012 Journal of Shoulder and Elbow Surgery Board of Trustees.",Excluded

DAP, procedure time, fluoroscopy time, number of cine-frames of the first 20 DSA procedures performed by these trainees were compared with that of the second 20 procedures. There was no significant difference concerning the procedure time between the first and the second 20 procedures (56.3 +/- 29.5 vs 51.5 +/- 20.2 min, p = 0.113). Numbers of cine-frames were very similar between the first and the second 20 procedures (750.7 +/- 290.3 vs 744.5 +/- 188.7, p = 0.830). Fluoroscopy time of the first 20 procedures was significantly longer than that of the second 20 procedures (17.8 +/- 15.4 vs 12.6 +/- 9.0, p = 0.001).

621,"Malignant angioglioma: Clinical, radiologic, and histopathologic features. Background Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is the most frequent malignant neoplasm in the adult brain. In contrast, arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) are presumably congenital lesions, usually presenting with hemorrhage. Hypervascular low-grade gliomas associated with AVMs were previously called angioglioma. An association of AVMs and GBM was also described. Study Aims We discuss the data of the largest series of locally coincident GBM with AVM in a single institution so far. All analyses were explorative only. Patients We report a series of four patients presenting at our department from 2006 to 2014. All patients underwent surgery. The cases were analyzed regarding initial presentation, clinical findings, tumor localization, and histopathologic results. Conclusions A local coincidence of cerebral AVM and GBM is rare. Only a few reports can be found in the literature. The radiologic as well as the clinical presentations are individual. Proangiogenic factors are discussed as involved in the appearance of both entities in the same location. However, the presence of pathologic vessels within malignant gliomas is well known to all neurosurgeons and proangiogenic activity has been proven. Therefore, it seems possible that tumor activity itself contributes to the pathogenesis of a vascular malformation.Copyright © 2020 Georg Thieme Verlag. All rights reserved.",Excluded

However, it has been suggested that they could be involved in the aetiology of some types of brain tumours. Objective(s): The objective was to analyse the association between mobile phone exposure and primary central nervous system tumours (gliomas and meningiomas) in adults. Method(s): CERENAT is a multicenter case-control study carried out in four areas in France in 2004-2006. Data about mobile phone use were collected through a detailed questionnaire delivered in a face-to-face manner. Conditional logistic regression for matched sets was used to estimate adjusted ORs and 95% CIs. Result(s): A total of 253 gliomas, 194 meningiomas and 892 matched controls selected from the local electoral rolls were analysed. No association with brain tumours was observed when comparing regular mobile phone users with non-users (OR=1.24; 95% CI 0.86 to 1.77 for gliomas, OR=0.90; 95% CI 0.61 to 1.34 for meningiomas).

Background: A standard neoadjuvant regimen has not been defined for borderline resectable (BR) pancreatic cancer. This phase II trial was designed to determine the safety of accelerated fraction radiotherapy (AFRT) with capecitabine in patients with BR pancreatic cancer. Method(s): The patients had newly diagnosed BR adenocarcinoma of the pancreas and normal organ function. Intensity-modulated (n = 11) or 3D conformal (n = 2) radiotherapy was given to a dose of 50 Gy in 2.5-Gy fractions with capecitabine 825 mg/m2 twice on radiation days. The primary outcome was the frequency of severe treatment-related adverse events (AEs). The study was stopped before planned interim analysis because of 2 severe (grades 4 and 5) gastric ulcerations. Result(s): Thirteen patients were enrolled with a median age of 66 years. All patients completed treatment. Seven (54%) experienced grade 3+ treatment-related AEs. Severe gastric ulceration occurred in 2 patients despite receipt of >=43 Gy to only 1% (2-3 cm3) of the stomach. Lymphopenia (n = 7) was the only other severe AE that occurred in >1 patient. In 7 of the 13 patients, disease had progressed outside the pancreas at restaging. Five of the 13 underwent resection, and all had >10% viable tumor. Median progression-free survival (PFS) was 2.4 months (95% CI 1.9-5.9), and median survival was 9.1 months (95% CI 5.9-not reached). Among those who underwent resection, median PFS was 13.0 months (95% CI 4.4-not reached). Median survival was not reached.

1818,"Radiosurgery of vestibular schwannoma: prognostic factors for hearing outcome using 3D-constructive interference in steady state (3D-CISS). Purpose: Stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) is an effective treatment for vestibular schwannoma (VS). Three-dimensional (3D) constructive interference in steady state (CISS) is the preferred magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) sequence for evaluating signal changes in the inner ear endolymph. Previous studies demonstrated a correlation between pretreatment cochlear signal intensity in 3D-CISS and posttherapeutic hearing outcomes. The purpose of our study was to compare 3D-CISS sequences before and after primary SRS of unilateral VSs to evaluate the effect of radiosurgery on the 3D-CISS signal intensities of cochlea and sacculus/utriculus. Method(s): We retrospectively reviewed 47 patients with unilateral VS treated with SRS. The neuroradiological MRI datasets were analysed to evaluate the signal intensity of the inner ear structure, tumour size, Koos grade, tumour volume, and infiltration of the cochlear aperture before therapy and at follow-up. The differences in these signal intensities before SRS and at follow-up were correlated with clinical symptoms, cochlear radiation dose, tumour volume and infiltration of the cochlear aperture. Result(s): No differences were found between signal intensities in cochlea and utriculus/sacculus before and after SRS and no correlation with clinical symptoms, cochlear radiation dose, tumour volume, Koos grade or infiltration of the cochlear aperture (all p> 0.05). Conclusion(s): Our study supports the theory of a complex interaction causing alteration of the endolymph protein concentration and not a direct dependency on the SRS. Use of modern dosing schemes will have a positive impact on clinical outcome with preservation of hearing in patients with VS.Copyright © 2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.",Excluded
3485,"Geographical clustering of mortality from systemic lupus erythematosus in the United States: contributions of poverty, Hispanic ethnicity and solar radiation. The objective was to investigate whether spatial variation in poverty, Hispanic ethnicity, and solar radiation explains the strong pattern of geographical clustering of mortality from systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) in the United States. SLE mortality counts for women and men of black and white race in US counties, 1979-1998, were obtained from the National Center for Health Statistics. County-level poverty rates and proportions of Hispanic residents were drawn from the 1990 national census. The annual cumulative level of ambient ultraviolet 'B' radiation (UVB) was estimated for each county according to latitude, longitude, and elevation. Maps for the full study population and for sex - and race-specific subpopulations showed that the national pattern of geographical variation in SLE mortality primarily reflected the experience of white women. Formal spatial analysis of the data for white women identified 10 statistically significant, multi-county clusters--four with elevated and six with reduced SLE mortality rates. Multivariate regression modeling established that higher levels of poverty, Hispanic ethnicity, and UVB were each associated with elevated local rates of SLE mortality among white women. Statistical adjustment via the regression model was used to remove effects of these factors on local rates. In a re-application of spatial analysis to the adjusted rates, four clusters 'disappeared'. In those clusters, poverty, Hispanic ethnicity and UVB had explained an average of 58.2% of the deviations between local and national SLE mortality rates. In six clusters (including three that disappeared with adjustment), Hispanic ethnicity explained a larger percentage of the deviations between local and national rates than either poverty or UVB. In multivariate models based on data for black women and for men of both races, poverty and UVB had similar effects on SLE mortality rates to those observed among white women. However, Hispanic ethnicity was not a significant predictor of SLE mortality in any of these other groups. The contributions of poverty, Hispanic ethnicity and solar radiation to geographical variation of SLE mortality in the United States are substantial, but these factors do not fully account for the clustering phenomenon.",Excluded
1799,"[123 I]Iodometomidate for molecular imaging of adrenocortical cytochrome P450 family 11B enzymes. BACKGROUND: Due to advances in conventional imaging, adrenal tumors are detected with increasing frequency. However, conventional imaging provides only limited information on the origin of these lesions, which represent a wide range of different pathological entities. New specific imaging methods would therefore be of great clinical value. We, therefore, studied the potential of iodometomidate (IMTO) as tracer for molecular imaging of cytochrome P450 family 11B (Cyp11B) enzymes., METHODS: Inhibition of Cyp11B1 and Cyp11B2 by IMTO, etomidate, metomidate, and fluoroetomidate was investigated in NCI-h295 cells and in Y1 cells stably expressing hsCyp11B1 or hsCyp11B2. Pharmacokinetics and biodistribution after iv injection of [(123/125)I]IMTO were analyzed in mice in biodistribution experiments and by small-animal single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT). Furthermore, four patients with known adrenal tumors (two metastatic adrenal adenocarcinomas, one bilateral adrenocortical adenoma, and one melanoma metastasis) were investigated with [(123)I]iodometomidate-SPECT., RESULTS: In cell culture experiments, all compounds potently inhibited both Cyp11B1 and Cyp11B2.

In patients, adrenocortical tissue showed high and specific tracer uptake in both primary tumor and metastases with short investigation time and low radiation exposure, whereas the non-adrenocortical tumor did not exhibit any tracer uptake., CONCLUSION: We have successfully completed the development of an in vivo detection system of adrenal Cyp11B enzymes by [(123)I]IMTO scintigraphy in both experimental animals and humans. Our findings suggest that [(123)I]IMTO is a highly specific radiotracer for imaging of adrenocortical tissue. Due to the general availability of SPECT technology, we anticipate that [(123)I]IMTO scintigraphy may become a widely used tool to characterize adrenal lesions.",Excluded
1893,"Outbreak of pneumonia associated with emergent human adenovirus serotype 14--Southeast Alaska, 2008. BACKGROUND: In September 2008, an outbreak of pneumonia associated with an emerging human adenovirus (human adenovirus serotype 14 [HAdV-14]) occurred on a rural Southeast Alaska island. Nine patients required hospitalization, and 1 patient died., METHODS: To investigate the outbreak, pneumonia case patients were matched to control participants on the basis of age, sex, and community of residence. Participants in the investigation and their household contacts were interviewed, and serum samples and respiratory tract specimens were collected. Risk factors were evaluated by means of conditional logistic regression., RESULTS: Among 32 pneumonia case patients, 21 (65%) had confirmed or probable HAdV-14 infection. None of 32 matched control participants had evidence of HAdV-14 infection (P<.001 for the difference). Factors independently associated with pneumonia included contact with a known HAdV-14-infected case patient (odds ratio [OR], 18.3 [95% confidence interval {CI}, >or=2.0]), current smoking (OR, 6.7 [95% CI, >or=0.9]), and having neither traveled off the island nor attended a large public gathering (OR, 14.7 [95% CI, >or=2.0]). Fourteen (67%) of 21 HAdV-14-positive case patients belonged to a single network of people who socialized and often smoked together and infrequently traveled off the island. HAdV-14 infection occurred in 43% of case-patient household contacts, compared with 5% of control-participant household contacts (P = .005)., CONCLUSIONS: During a community outbreak in Alaska, HAdV-14 appeared to have spread mostly among close contacts and not widely in the community. Demographic characteristics and illness patterns among the case patients were similar to those observed in other recent outbreaks of HAdV-14 infection in the United States.",Excluded

BACKGROUND AND AIMS: After successful endoscopic hemostasis in bleeding peptic ulcer, addition of proton pump inhibitors reduce the rate of recurrent bleeding by maintaining intragastric pH at neutral level. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the effect of various proton pump inhibitors given through different routes on intragastric pH over 72 h after endoscopic hemostasis in bleeding peptic ulcer. METHOD(S): Ninety consecutive patients who had successful endoscopic therapy of bleeding peptic ulcer underwent 72-h continuous ambulatory intragastric pH study, were randomly assigned to receive p.o. omeprazole 80 mg bolus followed by 40 mg every 12 h for 72 h or i.v. 80 mg omeprazole followed by infusion 8 mg/h for 72 h. Oral pantoprazole 80 mg bolus followed by 80 mg every 12 h for 72 h or i.v. 80 mg pantoprazole followed by infusion of 8 mg/h for 72 h. Oral rabeprazole 80 mg bolus followed by 40 mg every 12 h for 72 h or i.v. 80 mg rabeprazole followed by infusion 8 mg/h for 72 h. Five patients received no treatment after successful endoscopic therapy and underwent 72-h pH study. RESULT(S): Mean 72-h intragastric pH for p.o. omeprazole was 6.56 versus 6.93 for omeprazole infusion (P = 0.48). Mean 72-h intragastric pH for p.o. pantoprazole was 6.34 versus 6.32 for pantoprazole infusion (P = 0.62). Mean 72-h intragastric pH for rabeprazole p.o. was 6.11 versus 6.18 rabeprazole i.v.

1548,"Reliability of motor-evoked potentials in the ADM muscle of older adults. The purpose of this study was to determine the reliability of motor-evoked potentials (MEPs) produced in the abductor digiti minimi (ADM) muscle of male and female older adults, both within and between sessions. The number of trials within a session required to obtain reliable results was also examined. The investigation was conducted on 30 elderly individuals (15 M, 15 F; mean age 76 years). With the ADM at rest, MEPs were evoked at intensities of 1.1, 1.3, and 1.5 times motor threshold (MT). Ten stimuli were delivered at each intensity, with 10-12s between stimuli. The MEP responses were blocked with two, three, four, and five-stimuli means in each block. An intraclass correlation (ICC) reliability analysis of variance model was used to assess reliability of the MEP amplitude, using a variable number of trials per block. A subset of 10 subjects repeated the protocol following 20min of rest to assess the reliability between sessions. As expected, MEP amplitudes were significantly higher as stimulus intensity increased. There were no significant differences between blocks, nor was there a significant gender effect. ICC reliability coefficients ranged between 0.09 with two trials per block and 0.97 with five trials per block. Between session reliability ranged from 0.65 to 0.83. Highly reliable MEP amplitudes can be obtained in older individuals using two blocks of TMS stimuli with five trials per block.",Excluded
1752,"Sorafenib acts synergistically in combination with radiotherapy without causing intestinal damage in colorectal cancer. AIMS AND BACKGROUND: Colorectal cancer is one of the commonest cancers. Chemoradiotherapy gives better results than radiotherapy or chemotherapy in colorectal cancer. To enhance radiosensitivity of tumor cells for chemoradiotherapy, targeted therapy drugs that act as radiosensitizers can be used. In the present study, we provide a scientific rationale for the clinical application of sorafenib as a radiosensitizer in colorectal cancer, without causing significant adverse effects on normal intestinal tissue., METHODS: Three human colorectal adenocarcinoma cell lines (HCT116, HT-29, and SW480) were treated with sorafenib alone, or radiation followed by sorafenib. In vitro tests were performed using colony forming assays, cell cycle analysis, and comet assays. In addition, the effects of sorafenib and radiation therapy on the inhibition HT-29 tumor growth and survival of intestinal jejunum crypts were examined in vivo., RESULTS: Sorafenib increased the radiosensitivity of tumor cells in human colon adenocarcinoma cell lines (HCT116, HT-29, and SW480), as well as in HT-29 xenograft animal models. Sorafenib, in combination with ionizing radiation, induced the accumulation of tumor cells in the G2-M phase and delayed the repair of DNA damage caused by ionizing radiation. The combination of sorafenib and ionizing radiation did not enhance the apoptosis of intestinal crypt cells, compared with the use of radiation alone., CONCLUSIONS: We provide a scientific rationale for the use of sorafenib in combination with radiotherapy in colorectal cancer.",Excluded
2264,"Real-time optical image guided radiation therapy (IGRT) of breast/chest wall cancer. Purpose/Objective(s):We are developing real-time 3D/4D video guidance to reduce breast and chest wall setup errors and track target motion during post-mastectomy chest wall/nodal irradiation, breast only irradiation, and breast nodal irradiation in a clinical trial. We have also compared the reliability, accuracy, and precision of camera-based IGRT with results of weekly portal image verification and weekly CBCT volumetric matching. Materials/Methods: One-hundred forty patients, 102 breast only, 23 breast + nodal, and 15 chest wall + nodal, were accrued in an IRB-approved clinical trial of IGRT using 3D/4D optical images at daily setup and beamon time. Breast board and vacuum bag were used for all patients. Eleven patients with left-side diseases were treated under deep inspiration breath hold using ABC device and twenty-two patient using IMRT. Target shifts and rotations relating to CT-based planned reference surface were determined with real-time optical surface images using modified iterativeclosest-point alignment. A selected light ray intersecting the middle-upper abdominal surface and the anterior surface of the target projected onto the principal components were used as the real-time point/marker-based and surface/volume-based motion tracking, respectively. The optical guidance and real-time respiratory motion tracking were completely performed by therapists and results were semi-automatically saved in the camera-control computer. The target displacements (shifts and rotations) were compared with results of the weekly CBCT and portal images from EPID. Motion curves of surface Intersection point and surface principal components were also compared with breathing volume curves from the ABC system. Result(s): Daily target setup errors were reduced from 0.9 cm to <0.4 cm by using the 3D/4D video surface-guidance that was always consistent with results of portal images and CBCT if there were no big body motion during CBCT scanning. Higher accuracy and precision of 0.2 cm and longer stability without hardware change for clinical usage in four years were achieved for the video camera operated at the imaging speed and tracking rate of 15 frames per second. The novel intersection point and surface motion trackings were also more sensitive and accurate than that of commercial RPM and ABC systems. UP to 2 cm body sag on the slant breast board during longer IMRT treatments and surface deformation for five large breasts and some patients undertaken deep breath hold irradiation were detected. Conclusion(s): Accurate and precise optical image-guided setup of breast and chest wall targets was clinically validated with thousands of portal images and CBCT scans on 140 patients. More importantly, one can reliably track irregular target motion during daily dose delivery and detect gross target deformation during the entire course of treatment. The video guidance provides us all-time IGRT of breast and chest wall cancer without large volume low dose irradiation in taking daily CBCT and/or portal images.",Excluded
1415,"Intracranial Autograft Fat Placement to Separate the Optic Chiasm from Tumor to Improve Stereotactic Radiotherapy Dosimetry. Background: Radiation therapy for intracranial lesions is constrained by dose to neurologic organs at risk. Case Description: We report 2 cases, a newly diagnosed chondrosarcoma and a previously irradiated meningioma, with tumors that abutted the optic chiasm following subtotal resection. Definitive radiotherapy would have required either undercoverage of the tumor or treatment of the chiasm with doses posing an unacceptable risk of blindness. Therefore, the patients underwent open surgery with placement of an abdominal fat autograft to provide space between the tumor and the optic structures at risk. Patients received definitive fractionated stereotactic radiotherapy. For each patient, we retrospectively compared the treated plan (with fat autograft) to a second plan generated using the pre-autograft imaging, maintaining similar tumor coverage. For the chondrosarcoma, the fat autograft reduced the optic chiasm maximum dose by 21% (70.4 Gy to 55.3 Gy). For the reirradiated peri-optic meningioma, the optic chiasm maximum dose was reduced by 10% (50.8 Gy to 45.9 Gy), the left optic nerve by 17% (48.9 Gy to 40.4 Gy), and the right optic nerve by 30% (32.3 Gy to 22.6 Gy). Conclusion(s): We demonstrate the utility of abdominal fat autograft placement to maximize coverage of tumor while minimizing dose to intracranial organs at risk.Copyright © 2020 Elsevier Inc.",Excluded
1117,"Modalities of surveillance in treated nasopharyngeal cancer. OBJECTIVE: We sought to assess the efficacy of different modalities in the detection of disease during the early posttreatment period of nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC). STUDY DESIGN AND SETTING: We prospectively evaluated 57 patients with NPC who were treated with radiation. A postnasal space (PNS) biopsy, an endoscopic examination, and computed tomography (CT) scans were performed 4 months after treatment. RESULT(S): Four patients had evidence of disease in the PNS biopsy specimen. The sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values of the endoscopic examination were 75%, 94.3%, 50%, and 98%, respectively, while those of the CT scan were 50%, 49.1%, 6.9%, and 92.9%, respectively. CONCLUSION(S): In the early postradiation period for patients with NPC, an endoscopic examination is a suitable surveillance modality, but routine CT scanning has no added clinical benefit. SIGNIFICANCE: When an endoscopic examination of the PNS yields normal results, a biopsy is not necessary because the likelihood of disease is low.",Excluded
1076,"Estimation of the displacement of cardiac substructures and the motion of the coronary arteries using electrocardiographic gating. Purpose: The aim of this study was to quantify the displacement of cardiac substructures, including the anterior myocardial territory (AMT), left ventricle, and coronary arteries during a normal cardiac cycle. Material(s) and Method(s): Computed tomography (CT) images with retrospective electrocardiographic gating of 17 eligible patients were obtained. All images were reconstructed automatically for the end-diastolic and end-systolic phases. CT scanning without contrast at a random phase and a selected vertebral body were used as references to measure three-dimensionaldisplacements of the cardiac substructures. Result(s): The displacement between the end-diastolic and end-systolic phases (Dd-s) was greater than that between the end-systolic and random phases and between the end-diastolic and random cardiac phases. The largest displacements for the heart were in the left, posterior, and inferior directions with an average Dd-s of approximately 4-6 mm. The average Dd-s for the AMT and left ventricle was 1.2-2.7 mm in the anterior and right directions, 4.3-7.8 mm in left and posterior directions, and 4.9-6.3 mm in superior and inferior directions. For the coronary arteries, the average Dd-s was 2.8-5.9 mm in the anterior-posterior direction, 3.5-6.6 mm in left-right direction, and 3.8-5.3 mm in the superior-inferior direction. Inter-observer agreement was excellent for the heart, AMT, and left ventricle (kappa coefficient, >0.75 for all) and good for most coronary arteries in three dimensions (kappa coefficient, 0.511-0.687). The Dd-s did not differ significantly between men and women. Conclusion(s): Most average displacements of the cardiac substructures and coronary arteries were 3-8 mm in three dimensions. These findings will be useful to accurately estimate the radiation dose to cardiac substructures during thoracic radiation and to evaluate the risk of radiation-related heart disease. © 2013 Tan et al.

1311,"Computed tomography evaluation of the femoral and tibial attachments of the posterior cruciate ligament in vitro. PURPOSE: The optimal technique for reconstruction of the posterior cruciate ligament (PCL) is controversial. Regardless of surgical technique and graft choice, anatomic graft placement is essential for successful outcome. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the size and location of the insertions of the PCL using a computed tomography (CT) protocol., METHODS: The insertions in ten knees were marked in vitro with plastic markers. The CT examination was performed with the knee in extension. On the femur, the position of the center of the insertion site was evaluated relative to Blumensaat's line and the anterior articular surface. On the tibia, the location of the center of the insertion site was described relative to the borders of the tibial plateau and the retrospinal surface., RESULTS: The surface area of the femoral insertion measured 232 mm(-2) and was centered 8.9 mm from the roof of the intercondylar notch and 18.7 mm from the anterior articular cartilage surface. The surface area of the tibial insertion was 155 mm(2) and was centered 9.1 mm from the posterior border of the tibia on the retrospinal surface, 1.6 mm inferior to the plane of the tibial articular surface. This point was on average 49% of the way across the plateau relative to the medial edge of the plateau and 87% of the way across the plateau relative to the anterior edge., CONCLUSIONS: Computed tomography can provide detailed localization of the PCL attachment sites on the femur and tibia. Radiation exposure and cost may preclude routine use.",Excluded

Background: Medial compartment arthrosis associated with loss of osseous homeostasis (positive technetium bone scan) is a well recognized long term sequelae in patients with documented medial meniscus tears. The temporal occurrence of this loss of osseous homeostasis has not to the present been shown. Purpose(s): To report the preoperative scintigraphic imaging findings in 79 patients with MRI documented medial meniscus tears and normal radiographs. Material(s) and Method(s): 79 adults (66 males and 13 females) without a history of prior injury or surgery between the ages of 27 and 61 (mean age 41) were included in the study. All patients had a normal preoperative Rosenberg x-ray (weight bearing PA radiograph) an MRI diagnostic of a structurally damaged medial meniscus, and a standard three-hour delayed technetium 99m-MDP bone scan of the knees. Result(s): 77/79 (97%) of the technetium bone scans were positive (increased scintigraphic activity) manifesting loss of osseous homeostasis in the medial compartment of the knees with documented torn medial meniscus findings of in the face of normal structural bone imaging . All patients had surgical documentation of the medial meniscus tears. Discussion(s): Loss of osseous homeostasis of the medial compartment of knees with documented medial meniscus tears was present at a time when the radiographic findings were normal. The conceptualization of the extent of the pathology in such patients needs to include loss of osseous homeostasis. Future studies documenting the post-operative history of surgically treated patients with medial meniscus tears may yield information of interest regarding the development of osteoarthritis (OA) of the knee. It is postulated that the persistent post-operative loss of osseous homeostasis may identify those knees as ones at risk of the early development of OA, whereas the restoration of osseous homeostasis may be an important marker that such knees are not at risk for the development of OA.",Excluded

PURPOSE: To evaluate the extent of normal variation in implantable port devices between supine fluoroscopy and upright chest x-ray in relation to body mass index (BMI) based on three different measurement methods.
METHODS: Retrospectively, 80 patients with implanted central venous access port systems from 2012-01-01 until 2013-12-31 were analyzed. Three parameters (two quantitative and one semi-quantitative) were determined to assess port positions: projection of port capsule to anterior ribs (PCP) and intercostal spaces, ratio of extra- and intravascular catheter portions (EX/IV), normalized distance of catheter tip to carina (nCTCD). Changes were analyzed for males and females and normal-weight and overweight patients using analysis of variance with Bonferroni-corrected pairwise comparison.
RESULTS: PCP revealed significantly greater changes in chest x-rays in overweight women than in the other groups (p&lt;0.001, F-test). EX/IV showed a significantly higher increase in overweight women than normal-weight women and men and overweight men (p&lt;0.001). nCTCD showed a significantly greater increase in overweight women than overweight men (p = 0.0130). There were no significant differences between the other groups. Inter- and intra-observer reproducibility was high (Cronbach alpha of 0.923-1.0) and best for EX/IV.
CONCLUSIONS: Central venous port systems show wide normal variations in the projection of catheter tip and port capsule. In overweight women apparent catheter migration is significantly greater compared with normal-weight women and with men. The measurement of EX/IV and PCP are straightforward methods, quick to perform, and show higher reproducibility than measurement of catheter tip-to-carina distance.",Excluded

Objective: The objective of the study was to investigate the effects of low-tube-voltage computed tomography (CT) venography on qualitative and quantitative image parameters and the radiation dose. Method(s): Eighty-eight studies on 84 patients underwent pelvic and lower-extremity CT venography under protocol A (standard 120 kV with 150 mL of contrast material, n = 44) or protocol B (80 kV with 100 mL of contrast material, n = 44) on a 64-detector CT scanner. We compared the dose length product in the 2 protocols. Two blinded observers measured CT attenuation in the veins, the image noise, contrast-to-noise ratio, and figure of merit. Result(s): The mean dose length product was significantly lower under protocol B than A (603.2 [SD, 67.2] vs 1131.7 [SD, 67.0] mGy x cm) (P < 0.01). Mean CT attenuation of the veins was significantly greater with protocol B (125.3 [SD, 16.2] vs 106.1 [SD, 16.0] Hounsfield units) (P < 0.01), and the mean image noise was also significantly higher under protocol B (6.6 [SD, 0.8] vs 4.9 [SD, 0.7] Hounsfield units) (P < 0.01). There was no difference in contrast-to-noise ratio (P = 0.46). Figure of merit was significantly higher under protocol B (P < 0.01).

2784,"Cost of treating diabetic foot ulcers in five different countries. Most estimates in the literature for the economic cost of treating a diabetic foot ulcer (DFU) are from industrialized countries. There is also marked heterogeneity between the complexity of cases considered in the different studies. The goal of the present article was to estimate treatment costs and costs to patients in five different countries (Chile, China, India, Tanzania, and the United States) for two hypothetical, but well-defined, DFUs at the extreme ends of the complexity spectrum. A co-author, who is a treating physician in the relevant country, was asked to choose treatment plans that represented the typical application of local resources to the DFU. The outcomes were pre-defined as complete healing in case 1 and trans-tibial amputation in case 2, but the time course of treatment was determined by each investigator in a manner that would be typical for their clinic. The costs, in local currencies, for each course of treatment were estimated with the assistance of local hospital administrators. Typical reimbursement scenarios in each country were used to estimate the cost burden to the patient, which was then expressed as a percentage of the annual per capita purchasing power parity-adjusted gross domestic product. There were marked differences in the treatment plans between countries based on the availability of resources and the realities of local conditions. The costs of treatment for case 1 ranged from Int$102 to Int$3959 in Tanzania and in the United States, respectively. The cost for case 2 ranged from Int$3060 to Int$188645 in Tanzania and in the United States, respectively. The cost burden to the patient varied from the equivalent of 6days of average income in the United States for case 1 to 5.7years of average annual income for case 2 in India. Although these findings do not take cost-effectiveness into account, they highlight the dramatic economic burden of a DFU for patients in some countries. © 2012 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",Excluded
294,"Nail dystrophy and periungual discoloration in sarcoidosis. Background : Sarcoidosis is a multisystem granulomatous disorder that can affect all organs of the body. The disease course can vary from a self-limiting illness to a chronic disease with flares and relapses. Nail changes are rare in sarcoidosis, but can include clubbing, discolouration, dystrophy, subungual hyperkeratosis, splinter haemorrhages and longitudinal ridges. Such changes are frequently an indication of systemic disease, We report a rare case of systemic sarcoidosis presenting as nail dystrophy with painful phalanges and underlying bony cysts. Observation: A 57 year old moroccan woman, with a 2-year history of periungual redpurplish discoloration associated with nail dystrophy of 4 of his toes, presented to the dermatology department. Examination of his toes showed evidence of red to purple discoloration in the nail folds with associated nail dystrophy and subungual hyperkeratosis. Examination of his entire skin showed a symetric ulcerated dactilitis of 2 fingers. Nail clippings were obtained for mycological examination, with negative results. A Hand and toes X-ray demonstrated bony cysts, trabecular pattern and osteolysis in distal phalanx. CT showed multiples lymphadenopaty above and under diaphragmatic. A punch biopsy taken from the nail bed, the lymphadenopathy and salivary gland showed sarcoid granulomas in the dermis and a chronic inflammatory infiltrate. With all this finding, the diagnosis of systemic sarcoidosis was making, and the patient receive a systemic treatment with corticosteroid: 0.5 mg/kg/day. After 1 week of treatment, the patient had a good response. Key message: Although nail changes are rare in sarcoidosis, they are often associated with systemic involvement (commonly pulmonary involvement, dactylitis and lymphadenopathy) and underlying bony changes. Thus, in patients presenting with nail involvement, a search for possible systemic involvement should take place, and this should include radiological imaging of hands and feet alongside chest imaging.",Excluded
3556,"A double-blind randomised controlled trial of a natural oil-based emulsion (Moogoo Udder Cream R) containing allantoin versus aqueous cream for managing radiation-induced skin reactions in patients with cancer. BACKGROUND: Radiation-induced skin reaction (RISR) is one of the most common and distressing side effects of radiotherapy in patients with cancer. It is featured with swelling, redness, itching, pain, breaks in skin, discomfort, and a burning sensation. There is a lack of convincing evidence supporting any single practice in the prevention or management of RISR., METHODS/DESIGNS: This double-blinded randomised controlled trial aims to investigate the effects of a natural oil-based emulsion containing allantoin (as known as Moogoo Udder Cream R) versus aqueous cream in reducing RISR, improving pain, itching and quality of life in this patient group. One group will receive Moogoo Udder Cream R. Another group will receive aqueous cream. Outcome measures will be collected using patient self-administered questionnaire, interviewer administered questionnaire and clinician assessment at commencement of radiotherapy, weekly during radiotherapy, and four weeks after the completion of radiotherapy., DISCUSSION: Despite advances of radiologic advances and supportive care, RISR are still not well managed. There is a lack of efficacious interventions in managing RISR. While anecdotal evidence suggests that Moogoo Udder Cream R may be effective in managing RISR, research is needed to substantiate this claim.

3097,"Factors influencing aversion to specific electrodiagnostic studies. Objective: To compare the degree of discomfort caused by nerve conduction studies (NCS) versus needle electromyography (EMG), and to determine what factors predict aversion to one test or the other. Method(s): Two hundred patients underwent both EMG and NCS, and were asked to indicate which test was more uncomfortable. Responses were then correlated with demographic information, testing characteristics, and medical histories to identify any notable associations. Result(s): Of the 200 patients, 58.5% (117) of the patients found the NCS more uncomfortable than EMG. Sixty-one percent (11/18) of the younger patients (18-29 years old) found EMG more uncomfortable (P = 0.08), whereas 68% (40/59) of the older patients (age greater than 60 years old) found NCS more uncomfortable (P = 0.05). Sixty-seven percent (14/21) of the patients whose BMI was less than 22 kg/m2 rated EMG as more uncomfortable (P = 0.01). Sixty-nine percent (27/39) of the patients whose BMI was greater than or equal to 38 found the NCS more uncomfortable (P = 0.02). A positive correlation existed between NCS discomfort and number of nerves tested. 67% (35/52) of the patients with polyneuropathy found NCS more uncomfortable. Conclusion(s): Nerve conduction studies are more uncomfortable than needle EMG in the majority of patients, and predictions regarding which test will be more uncomfortable for a given patient are possible.

2852,"Diagnostic accuracy of 320-row computed tomography as compared with invasive coronary angiography in unselected, consecutive patients with suspected coronary artery disease. Noninvasive coronary angiography with multislice computed tomography (CT) scanners is feasible with high sensitivity and negative predictive value. The radiation exposure associated with this technique, however, is high and concerns in the widespread use of CT have arisen. We evaluated the diagnostic accuracy of coronary angiography using 320-row CT, which avoids exposure-intensive overscanning and overranging. We prospectively studied 118 unselected consecutive patients with suspected coronary artery disease (CAD) referred for invasive coronary angiography (ICA). All patients had 320-row CT within 1 week of ICA, which, together with quantitative analysis, served as the reference standard. Of the 65 out of 118 patients who were diagnosed as having CAD by ICA, 64 (98 %) were correctly identified at 320-row CT. Noteworthy, 320-row CT correctly detected CAD in 3 patients with atrial fibrillation and ruled out the disease in the other 8 patients. From 151 significant coronary stenoses detected on ICA, 137 (91 %) were correctly identified with 320-row CT. In the per-patient analysis, sensitivity and specificity of 320-row CT were 98 and 91 %, respectively. In the per-vessel analysis, sensitivity and specificity of 320-row CT were 93 and 95 %, respectively. In the per segment analysis, sensitivity and specificity of 320-row CT were 91 and 99 %, respectively. Diameter stenosis determined with the use of CT showed good correlation with ICA (P < 0.001, R = 0.81) without significant underestimation or overestimation (-3.1 +/- 24.4 %; P = 0.08). Comparison of CT with ICA revealed a significantly smaller effective radiation dose (3.1 +/- 2.3 vs. 6.5 +/- 4.2 mSv; P < 0.05) and amount of contrast agent required (99 +/- 51 vs. 65 +/- 42 ml, P < 0.05) for 320 row CT. The present study in an unselected population including patients with atrial fibrillation demonstrates that 320-row CT may significantly reduce the radiation dose and amount of contrast agent required compared with ICA while maintaining a very high diagnostic accuracy. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media, B.V.",Excluded
2076,"Impact of VMAT-IMRT compared to 3D conformal radiotherapy on anal sphincter dose distribution in neoadjuvant chemoradiation of rectal cancer. Background: Neoadjuvant radio- or chemoradiation (nIRT) therapy is the standard treatment for loco-regional advanced rectal cancer patients of the lower or middle third. Currently, intensity modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) is not the recommended radiation technique even though IMRT has advantages compared to 3D-radiation regarding dose sparing to organs at risk like small bowel and urinary bladder. So far, the benefit of IMRT concerning the anal sphincter complex is not examined. With this study we intended to evaluate the dose distribution on the anal sphincters of rectal cancer patients treated with IMRT in comparison with 3D-techniques. Method(s): We selected 16 patients for the IMRT-group and 16 patients for the 3D-group with rectal cancer of the middle third who were treated in our institute. All patients received 45 Gy in a chemoradiation protocol. Patients in both groups were matched regarding stage, primary tumor distance to the anal verge and size of the tumor. We delineated the internal and external anal sphincters, the addition of both sphincters and the levator ani muscle in all patients. Subsequently, we evaluated and compared dose parameters of the different sphincters in both groups and analysed the configuration of the isodoses in the area of the caudal radiation field, respectively. Result(s): Most of the relevant dose parameters of the caudal sphincters (Dmean, Dmedian, V10-V40) were significantly reduced in the IMRT-group compared to the 3D-group. Accordingly, the isodoses at the caudal edge of the target volume in the IMRT group demonstrated a steep dose fall. The levator ani muscle always was included into the planned target volumes and received the full dose in both groups. Conclusion(s): The modern VMAT-IMRT can significantly reduce the dose to the anal sphincters for rectal cancer patients of the middle third who were treated with conventional chemoradiation therapy.Copyright © 2018 The Author(s).",Excluded
243,"Bath-water PUVA therapy with 8-methoxypsoralen in mycosis fungoides. PUVA therapy is widely used for early stage mycosis fungoides. While the efficacy of PUVA with oral 8-methoxypsoralen (8-MOP) is well documented, the use of its topical variation, bath-water PUVA therapy with 8-MOP has not been studied. The purpose of this study was to assess the effect of 8-MOP bath-water PUVA therapy in adult patients with early stage mycosis fungoides. We retrospectively evaluated the outcomes of bath-water delivery of 8-MOP (1 mg l(-1)) in 16 patients with early stage mycosis fungoides. In all patients complete response was achieved after a mean duration of 63 days requiring 29 treatments and a mean cumulative UVA dose of 33 J cm(-2). The time to relapse after complete clinical clearance was 45.6 (+/-9.2) weeks. In comparison, oral PUVA therapy with 8-MOP resulted in complete response after 64.5 days (25.8 treatments) with a mean relapse-free period of 30 (+/-3.5) weeks. We conclude that bath-water PUVA therapy with 8-MOP is a valuable photo-therapeutic alternative, which should be considered for patients in whom systemic psoralen cannot be used.",Excluded
2977,"Outcomes of Hodgkin's lymphoma patients with relapse or progression following first autologous stem cell transplantation. According to recent retrospective analyses, the median survival of patients (pts) with relapsed/progressed Hodgkin's lymphoma (HL) following autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT) may exceed 2 years regardless of therapeutic approach. We retrospectively evaluated the outcome of 103 (female: 39, male: 64) pts, who underwent 1st ASCT for HL from September 1990 to November 2008 and relapsed or progressed. Sixty-four pts had been transplanted for refractory disease. The median time to relapse/progression was 5 (0.7-132) months post ASCT, and < 12 months in 77/103 pts. The median age at relapse was 29 (13-67) years. The stage at relapse was advanced (III or IV) in 58, and B-symptoms were present in 26 pts. In 41 pts, progression of disease to additional sites was noted. Salvage treatment was chemotherapy +/- irradiation (R/T) in 75 pts, R/T only in 6, 2nd SCT in 14 (ASCT in 3, and alloSCT with a reduced-intensity regimen in 11), while 2 refused any therapy. Six pts had a positive PET-scan without clinical suggestion of active disease, and did not receive any treatment (watch-and-wait approach). Sixty of the 95 treated pts achieved a complete (38 pts, 40%) or partial (22 pts, 24%) remission. The interval of < 12 months from 1st ASCT to relapse, advanced stage and presence of B-symptoms at relapse, as well as the disease refractoriness before 1st ASCT emerged as significant adverse factors for response rate (P < 0,05 by t-test). The median survival for all pts was 29.5 months. Multivariate analysis revealed late relapse (> 12 months), absence of B-symptoms at relapse and disease sensitivity before 1st ASCT as significant factors for prolonged survival (P < 0.05). The type of treatment had no impact on survival rates. Three of the 14 re-transplanted pts (2 allo- and 1 autografted) are alive (with 2 in CR for 7 and 5 years, respectively). Eight re-transplanted pts succumbed to progressive disease and 3 to treatment related toxicity. Interestingly, all 6 patients managed with the watch-and-wait approach are alive without disease progression for a median of 12 (1.5-45) months. Our results confirm that selected pts with relapsed or progressed HL following ASCT could be rescued with recent treatment modalities. Currently, given the conventional and alternative treatment options, management of relapsed disease post 1st ASCT remains a challenge and prospective studies with large series of pts are needed to establish the appropriate approach.",Excluded
666,"Radiotherapy for nodal recurrence after chemoradiotherapy for esophageal carcinoma. Background. To evaluate the treatment outcome of radiotherapy for nodal recurrence after definitive chemoradiotherapy for esophageal carcinoma. Methods. Between 1996 and 2001, ten patients with isolated nodal recurrence after definitive chemoradiotherapy received radiotherapy with or without chemotherapy. The site of recurrence was the mediastinum in five patients, the celiac node in four patients, and the supraclavicular fossa in one patient. All sites of nodal recurrence were outside the previous irradiated area and without local recurrence or distant metastases. Radiotherapy was given with three-dimensional conformal technique, and an average total dose was 60 Gy. Eight patients received chemotherapy concurrently with radiotherapy. Chemotherapy consisted of two cycles of cisplatin and 5-FU. Results. The control rate of the irradiated region was eight of ten patients. The size of all controlled lesions was 3 cm or less in diameter. In five patients, distant metastases developed to other organs and caused death. Two patients survived without disease for 5 years and three patients survived 2 years or more. In four patients with an interval of 2 years or longer between the previous treatment and nodal recurrence, three patients survived without disease. Improvement of clinical symptoms such as dysphagia or hoarseness was obtained in five of six patients. Conclusions. Radiotherapy for isolated nodal recurrence of esophageal carcinoma after definitive chemoradiotherapy is suggested to be safe and effective.

1337,"Imaging Findings Within the First 12 Months of Hepatocellular Carcinoma Treated With Stereotactic Body Radiation Therapy. Purpose: To correlate the imaging findings of treated hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) after stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) with explant pathology and alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) response. Methods and Materials: From 2007 to 2015, of 146 patients treated with liver SBRT for Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer stage A hepatocellular carcinoma, 10 were identified with inclusion criteria and had regular interval follow-up magnetic resonance imaging/triple phase computed tomography and explant pathology or declining AFP values for radiology-pathology response correlation. Reference standards for successful response were >90% necrosis on explant pathology or pretreatment AFP >75 ng/mL normalizing to <10 ng/mL within 1 year after SBRT without other treatment. Subjects were treated with 24 to 50 Gy in 3 to 5 fractions. Multiphasic magnetic resonance imaging or computed tomography performed at 3, 6, 9, and 12 months after SBRT was compared with pretreatment imaging by 2 expert radiologists. Descriptive statistics were calculated. Result(s): There were 10 subjects with 10 treated HCCs, classified as 3 Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network (OPTN) 5a, 4 OPTN 5b, and 3 OPTN 5x. All had successfully treated HCCs, according to explant pathology or declining AFP. Four of 10 HCCs had persistent central arterial hyperenhancement 3 to 12 months after SBRT; persistent wash-out was common up to 12 months (9 of 10). Of 10 treated HCCs, 9 exhibited decreased size at 12 months. Liver parenchyma adjacent to the lesion showed early (3-6 months) hyperemia followed by late (6-12 months) capsular retraction and delayed enhancement. No patient had a significant decline in liver function. Conclusion(s): In the absence of increasing size, persistent central arterial hyperenhancement and wash-out can occur within the first 12 months after SBRT in successfully treated HCCs and may not represent residual viable tumor. Liver parenchyma adjacent to the treated lesion showed inflammation followed by fibrosis, without significant change in hepatic function. Until a radiologic signature of tumor control is determined, freedom from local progression seems to be the best measure of HCC control after SBRT.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Inc.",Excluded
277,"An open-label, prospective pilot clinical study of denosumab for severe hyperparathyroidism in patients with low bone mass undergoing dialysis. CONTEXT: Denosumab is widely used for bone diseases with increased bone resorption. Its effectiveness in patients with severe secondary hyperparathyroidism on dialysis is unclear.
OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of denosumab in patients with severe secondary hyperparathyroidism who are on dialysis.
DESIGN: This 6-month prospective, open-labeled study evaluated 12 patients (five women, seven men; mean age 53.5 ± 3.8 y). All had intact PTH (iPTH; > 1000 pg/mL), low bone mass (T-score < -1.0 SD), and bone pain and were poor surgical candidates. Serum calcium, phosphorus, alkaline phosphatase (AP), and iPTH levels were assessed at baseline and every month thereafter. Vertebral spine x-rays and bone mineral densities (BMDs) (lumbar spine and femoral neck) were assessed at the start and end of the study. All patients received denosumab (60 mg), calcitriol, phosphate binders, and dialysate calcium that were adjusted according to the biochemistry data.
RESULTS: The BMD increased in both the femoral neck (mean increase 23.7% ± 4.0%) and lumbar spine (17.1% ± 2.6%) after 6 months. In the first month, most patients had increased iPTH levels, which dramatically decreased from 1702.1 ± 181.9 to 518.8 ± 126.8 pg/mL by the end of the study after increasing the calcitriol dose. All patients had significant decreases in AP, calcium × phosphorus, and bone pain. Changes in femoral neck BMD correlated only with AP and iPTH levels.
CONCLUSIONS: Denosumab is effective in restoring bone mass and reducing bone pain in patients on dialysis with secondary hyperparathyroidism. It also allows for a more aggressive use of calcitriol to control hyperparathyroidism.",Excluded
1276,"Role of brachytherapy in treatment of epidermoid carcinomas of the vallecula after conservative supraglottic laryngectomy followed by irradiation. PURPOSE: To evaluate survival and functional results of the treatment of carcinomas of the vallecula using surgery, irradiation, and interstitial brachytherapy., METHODS AND MATERIALS: Between 1990 and 1998, 36 patients with squamous cell carcinoma of the vallecula were treated with horizontal supraglottic functional laryngectomy, external beam radiotherapy (median dose 54 Gy), and additional interstitial brachytherapy (median dose 16 Gy). Results were compared with a previous series of 22 patients treated without brachytherapy., RESULTS: The median follow-up was 44 months. The 5-year actuarial overall survival rate was 61.3%. The 5-year specific survival rate was 86%, with 2 local failures (local control rate 94.4%) and 4 isolated distant metastases. Ten patients developed a second primary. The overall survival was 34% for 22 patients previously treated without brachytherapy. Severe toxicities occurred in 9 patients: death (related to larynx edema or inhalation, n = 1), soft tissue necrosis (n = 1), aspiration pneumonia (n = 1), mandibular necrosis (n = 2), pharyngocutaneous fistula (n = 2), and laryngeal edema (n = 2).

Background: Diffused-type giant cell tumor(Dt-GCT) is a rare, aggressive disorder of the joint synovium, bursa and tendon sheaths. Osseous erosions and subchondral cysts may develop as the result of synovium infiltration in Dt-GCT. We present a retrospective study of a series of patients who are diagnosed with Dt-GCT about the ankle joint, there clinical outcome is evaluated in this study. Material(s) and Method(s): Fifteen patients with radiologically and histologically confirmed Dt-GCT about the ankle joint were identified in our foot and ankle department. Patients were managed with open synovectomy for the tumor tissue and bone grafting for bony erosions. X-rays and MRI scans were used for evaluation of the tumor and bony erosions pre- and post-operatively. Pre- and post-operative ankle function was assessed using the American Orthopedic Foot and Ankle Society -Ankle and Hindfoot (AOFAS-AH) score and the Muscularskeletal Tumor Society (MSTS) score. Result(s): The mean follow-up duration was 37.4 months (range 25 to 50 months). There were 6 males and 9 females, with a mean age of 35 years old (range 18 to 65 years). All patients had talar erosion with the average size of 10.1*9.1z.ast;8.2 mm, distal tibia was affected in 5 patients with the average size of 6.2 5.6 5.8 mm. 7 patients had tendon involvement, 2 patients had recurrence and progression of ankle osteoarthritis.

2045,"Background radiation impacts human longevity and cancer mortality: reconsidering the linear no-threshold paradigm. The current linear no-threshold paradigm assumes that any exposure to ionizing radiation carries some risk, thus every effort should be made to maintain the exposures as low as possible. We examined whether background radiation impacts human longevity and cancer mortality. Our data covered the entire US population of the 3139 US counties, encompassing over 320 million people. This is the first large-scale study which takes into account the two major sources of background radiation (terrestrial radiation and cosmic radiation), covering the entire US population. Here, we show that life expectancy, the most integrative index of population health, was approximately 2.5 years longer in people living in areas with a relatively high vs. low background radiation. (>= 180 mrem/year and <= 100 mrem/year, respectively; p < 0.005; 95% confidence interval [CI]). This radiation-induced lifespan extension could to a great extent be associated with the decrease in cancer mortality rate observed for several common cancers (lung, pancreas and colon cancers for both genders, and brain and bladder cancers for males only; p < 0.05; 95% CI). Exposure to a high background radiation displays clear beneficial health effects in humans. These hormetic effects provide clear indications for re-considering the linear no-threshold paradigm, at least within the natural range of low-dose radiation.Copyright © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V. part of Springer Nature.",Excluded
3476,"Dynamic CT for Parathyroid Adenoma Detection: How Does Radiation Dose Compare With Nuclear Medicine?. OBJECTIVE: Dynamic CT is increasingly used for preoperative localization of parathyroid adenomas, but concerns remain about the radiation effective dose of CT compared with that of 99mTc-sestamibi scintigraphy. The purpose of this study was to compare the radiation dose delivered by three-phase dynamic CT with that delivered by 99mTc-sestamibi SPECT/CT performed in accordance with our current protocols and to assess the possible reduction in effective dose achieved by decreasing the scan length (i.e., z-axis) of two phases of the dynamic CT protocol., MATERIALS AND METHODS: The effective dose of a 99mTc-sestamibi nuclear medicine parathyroid study performed with and without coregistration CT was calculated and compared with the effective dose of our current three-phase dynamic CT protocol as well as a proposed protocol involving CT with reduced scan length., RESULTS: The median effective dose for a 99mTc-sestamibi nuclear medicine study was 5.6 mSv. This increased to 12.4 mSv with the addition of coregistration CT, which is higher than the median effective dose of 9.3 mSv associated with the dynamic CT protocol. Reducing the scan length of two phases in the dynamic CT protocol could reduce the median effective dose to 6.1 mSv, which would be similar to that of the dose from the 99mTc-sestamibi study alone., CONCLUSION: Dynamic CT used for the detection of parathyroid adenoma can deliver a lower radiation dose than 99mTc-sestamibi SPECT/CT. It may be possible to reduce the dose further by decreasing the scan length of two of the phases, although whether this has an impact on accuracy of the localization needs further investigation.",Excluded

In all, 86% of patients received 2 cycles of chemotherapy previously., RESULTS: Five treatment-related deaths occurred: pneumonitis, n = 1; progressive pulmonary fibrosis in patients with pre-existing pulmonary fibrosis, n = 2; haemorrhage, n = 2. In all, 8% of patients experienced grade 3 and 1.3% grade 4 pneumonitis; 11% showed late fibrotic alterations grade 2 in lung parenchyma. Clinically relevant acute esophagitis (grade 2 and 3) was seen in 33.3% of patients, 2 patients developed late esophageal stenosis (G3). Patients with upper lobe, middle lobe and central lower lobe tumours (n = 130) were treated with V20 (total lung) up to 50% and patients with peripheral lower lobe tumours (n = 14, basal lateral tumours excluded) up to 42%, without observing acute or late pulmonary toxicity >grade 3. Only patients with basal lateral lower lobe tumours (n = 5) experienced grade 4/5 pulmonary toxicity; V20 for this latter group ranged between 30 and 53%. The mean lung dose was below the QUANTEC recommendation of 20-23 Gy in all patients. The median follow-up time of all patients is 26.3 months (range 2.9-149.4) and of patients alive 80.2 months (range 63.9-149.4.). The median overall survival time of all patients is 26.3 months; the 2-, 5- and 8-year survival rates of 54, 21 and 15%, respectively.

2177,"ARFI cut-off values and significance of standard deviation for liver fibrosis staging in patients with chronic liver disease. Background. Acoustic radiation force impulse (ARFI) elastometry quantifies hepatic stiffness, and thus degree of fibrosis, non-invasively. Our aim was to analyse the diagnostic accuracy of ARFI cut-off values, and the significance of a defined limit of standard deviation (SD) as a potential quality parameter for liver fibrosis staging in patients with chronic liver diseases (CLD). Material and methods. 153 patients with CLD (various aetiologies) undergoing liver biopsy, and an additional 25 patients with known liver cirrhosis, were investigated. ARFI measurements were performed in the right hepatic lobe, and correlated with the histopathological Ludwig fibrosis score (inclusion criteria: at least 6 portal tracts). The diagnostic accuracy of cut-off values was analysed with respect to an SD limit of 30% of the mean ARFI value. Results. The mean ARFI elastometry showed 1.95 +/- 0.87 m/s (range 0.79-4.40) in 178 patients (80 female, 98 male, mean age: 52 years). The cut-offs were 1.25 m/s for F >= 2, 1.72 m/s for F >= 3 and 1.75 m/s for F = 4, and the corresponding AUROC 80.7%, 86.2% and 88.7%, respectively. Exclusion of 31 patients (17.4%) with an SD higher than 30% of the mean ARFI improved the diagnostic accuracy: The AUROC for F >= 2, F >= 3 and F = 4 were 86.1%, 91.2% and 91.5%, respectively. Conclusion. The diagnostic accuracy of ARFI can be improved by applying a maximum SD of 30% of the mean ARFI as a quality parameter - which however leads to an exclusion of a relevant number of patients. ARFI results with a high SD should be interpreted with caution.",Excluded

674,"Adjuvant radiotherapy for margin-positive high-grade soft tissue sarcoma of the extremity. Purpose: Adjuvant radiotherapy (RT) has been shown to improve local control in patients with soft tissue sarcoma of the extremities (STS). The specific impact of adjuvant radiation on patients with positive margins, however, has not been clearly defined. The purpose of this study was to determine if adjuvant RT improves local control in patients with high-grade STS who had positive margins of resection. Methods and Materials: Between 8/82 and 2/97, 110 adult patients with primary high-grade STS of an extremity underwent limb sparing surgery and were found to have a histologically positive microscopic surgical margin. Ninety-one (83%) received RT and 19 (17%) had no RT. The two groups were balanced with regard to size, site, location, and tumor depth. Adjuvant RT was delivered with brachytherapy (BRT) alone in 34 patients, external beam radiotherapy (EBRT) alone in 33 patients, or BRT+EBRT in 24 patients. The BRT dose was 45 Gy when used alone and 15-20 Gy when used as a boost. The EBRT dose was 60-70 Gy when used alone and 45-50 Gy when given with BRT. The median follow-up time was 41 months (range, 3-186 months). Result(s): The overall 5 year local control rate was 71%. This rate was significantly higher in the RT group compared to the no RT group (74% vs. 56%, respectively) (p = 0.01). On univariate analysis, lower extremity site and proximal location were also found to be predictors of improved local control (p = 0.03 and 0.03, respectively). However, only proximal location and the use of RT retained their significance as predictors of improved local control on multivariate analysis (p = 0.003 and 0.01, respectively). The overall 5-year distant relapse-free survival, disease-free survival, and overall survival rates were 54%, 44%, and 53%, respectively. No statistical differences were found in these survival rates between RT and no RT groups. Conclusion(s): Based on this study, adjuvant radiotherapy seems to improve local control in patients with high-grade STS of the extremity with positive margins. However, local recurrence still occurs in a substantial proportion of patients, mandating further need for improvement. Copyright (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Inc.",Excluded

PURPOSE: Concurrent chemoradiation therapy (CCRT) is useful in advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), but little is known about radiation-induced gastroduodenal complications following therapy. To determine risk factors, we investigated the prevalence and patterns of gastroduodenal complications following CCRT using endoscopy., METHODS AND MATERIALS: Enrolled in the study were 123 patients treated with CCRT for unresectable HCC between January 1998 and December 2005. Radiation-induced gastroduodenal complications were defined as radiation gastritis/duodenitis, radiation gastric/duodenal ulcer, or other gastroduodenal toxicity associated with radiation, based on Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE 3.0). Serious gastroduodenal complications were defined as events occurring within 12 months from completion of CCRT, those requiring prompt therapeutic intervention, or symptoms equivalent to Grade 3 or 4 radiation-related gastroduodenal toxicity, including nausea or vomiting, based on CTCAE 3.0., RESULTS: A month after completion of CCRT, 65 (52.8%) patients displayed endoscopic evidence of radiation-induced gastroduodenal complications. Radiation gastric and duodenal ulcers were found in 32 (26.0%) and 20 (16.3%) patients, respectively; radiation gastritis and duodenitis were found in 50 (40.7%) and 42 (34.1%) patients, respectively. Radiation-related bleeding was observed in 13 patients (10.6%). Serious gastroduodenal complications occurred in 18 patients (14.6%) and were significantly more frequent in patients with liver cirrhosis than in those without cirrhosis (p=0.043). There were no radiation-related deaths., CONCLUSIONS: Endoscopically detectable radiation-induced gastroduodenal complications were common in HCC following CCRT. Although serious complications were uncommon, the frequency was higher in patients with liver cirrhosis; thus, these patients should be closely monitored when receiving CCRT.

140,"Treatment of stage III non-small cell lung cancer patients with concurrent chemotherapy and radiation (70 Gy): Equivalent or superior to 60 or 74 Gy of RTOG 0617?. Purpose/Objective(s): RTOG 0617 demonstrated inferior outcomes with 74 Gy of concurrent radiation (RT) and chemotherapy (CT) compared to 60 Gy, though the findings are controversial. We hypothesized that an intermediate RT dose might reach equipoise and improve outcomes versus 60 Gy or 74 Gy. This retrospective single institution analysis analyzed patients treated uniformly with 70 Gy/concurrent CT. Materials/Methods: Records from 216 consecutive patients with Stage III NSCLC treated from 2000 to 2015 with concurrent CTand RT (70 Gy) were reviewed. Patient demographics, tumor/treatment details and outcomes were abstracted. Local failure (LF), regional failure (RF), distant failure (DF), disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS) were estimated using Kaplan-Meier univariate (UVA) and Cox-regression multivariate (MVA) analyses. Predictors of toxicity were evaluated by Pearson Chi-Square. Result(s): Median follow-up was 18 months. Median age was 63 years; 53% were female. Histology: adenocarcinoma (49%), squamous cell carcinoma (32%), other (19%). Patients were mostly stage IIIB (50.4%), T3/T4 (53.7%), N2 (64%) and N3 (28%), and were ECOG 0 (33%), 1 (56%), and 2 (11%) at diagnosis. CT included platinum doublets (94%), weekly (52%), induction (12%) and consolidative (22%) therapy. Median OS was 26 months and 2-yr survival was 58.1%. The 2-yr OS for IIIA and IIIB patients was 61.8% and 42.4%, respectively. The overall 2-yr LF, RF, and DF rates were 30.4%, 32.9% and 54.9%, respectively. 2-yr DFS was 28.8%. In UVA, ECOG predicted for LF (PZ0.004) and RF (PZ0.006). DF was associated with N stage (N0/1/2 vs. N3; P = 0.013), ECOG (P = 0.03) and IIIA vs. IIIB (P = 0.011). N stage (P = 0.041), ECOG (PZ0.0001) and overall stage (PZ0.007) were predictive of DFS. Stage (P = 0.003) and ECOG (P = 0.002) predicted for improved OS. ECOG was significant on MVA for LF, RF, DF, DFS and OS, while N stage was predictive for RF, DF, DFS and OS. Toxicity was manageable: 10.6% had Grade 3 esophagitis and 15.7% and 1.9% had Grade 2 or 3 pneumonitis with no Grade 4/5 events. Esophageal ulceration and dilation rates were 16.2% and 10.6%, respectively. Esophagitis grade was predictive of ulceration (P = 0.0001) or dilation (P = 0.0001). N stage (P = 0.008) and overall stage (P = 0.022) were predictive of pneumonitis grade. Conclusion(s): Patients in our cohort were frailer and had more advanced disease than the 0617 patients. Despite this, we demonstrate that CT with an intermediate RT dose of 70 Gy leads to better outcomes than the 74 Gy arm in RTOG 0617 with less esophageal toxicity. Preliminary analysis suggests that omission of ECOG-2 patients leads to superior outcomes for 70 Gy compared with the 60 Gy patients in 0617; analysis is ongoing.

Biopsies from the vastus lateralis muscle were obtained from three astronauts before and after two 5-day flights and from five astronauts before and after one 11-day flight (space shuttle flights: STS-32, -33, and -34). Muscle fibers from two separate samples from each biopsy were classified as type I and II or as type I, IIA, and IIB by using qualitative myofibrillar adenosinetriphosphatase (ATPase) staining. Cross-sectional area (CSA), number of capillaries per fiber, and the activities of succinate dehydrogenase (SDH), alpha-glycerophosphate dehydrogenase (GPD), and myofibrillar ATPase were determined from one sample of fibers of each myofibrillar ATPase type. Postflight biopsies had 6-8% fewer type I fibers than preflight. Mean fiber CSAs were 16-36% smaller after the 11-day flight with the relative effect being type IIB > IIA > I. Mean fiber CSAs were 11 and 24% smaller in type I and II fibers after 5 days of flight. Myofibrillar ATPase activities increased in type II but not in type I fibers after flight, whereas SDH activity was unaffected in either fast or slow fibers. GPD activity in type I fibers was approximately 80% higher (P > 0.05) postflight compared with preflight. Myofibrillar ATPase/SDH ratios in type II fibers were higher after than before flight, suggesting that some fast fibers were more susceptible to fatigue after flight. The GPD/SDH ratios were elevated in some type I fibers after spaceflight. The number of capillaries per fiber was 24% lower after than before flight, whereas the number of capillaries per unit CSA of muscle tissue was unchanged. These data suggest that adaptations in the size, metabolic properties, and vascularity of muscle fibers can occur rapidly in the space environment. These adaptations were qualitatively similar to those observed in animals after actual or simulated spaceflight conditions for short periods.",Excluded

Sarcoma of the head and neck region following irradiation for primary malignancy other than retinoblastoma has rarely been reported. Three cases of postirradiation sarcoma arising in the head and neck region following definitive radiotherapy for primary malignancies of the nasal cavity, paranasal sinuses, and larynx are presented. The intervals from initial radiation to diagnosis of sarcoma were 10 years, 10 1/2 years, and 12 1/2 years, respectively. The dosage ranged from 6000--6400 rads using conventional fractionation (1750--1811 ret) on a 60Cobalt teletherapy unit. Methotrexate (25 mg I. V. every three days for seven doses) was utilized during the initial course of radiation in two of the three patients. The cases conform well to established criteria for the diagnosis of radiation-induced sarcoma. Postirradiation sarcoma of the head and neck region is a remote hazard that must be weighed against the benefits of curative radiation therapy, particularly when treating in the presence of bone disease or when treating retinoblastoma or benign lesions.",Excluded

3629,"A preliminary study of the use of ultrasound in defining nasal fractures: Criteria for a confident diagnosis. Nasal fractures are usually diagnosed by clinical examination, with or without the support of imaging studies. While plain-film radiography lacks sensitivity and specificity for diagnosing nasal fractures, and computed tomography (CT) is not always practical or cost-effective, ultrasonography (US) may be useful in this regard. The criteria by which adult nasal fractures are reliably identified on US must be clear. We conducted a preliminary prospective, controlled, observational study to define the appearance of nasal fractures on US. We used US to image 12 patients with a clinical or radiologic (CT or x-ray) diagnosis of nasal fracture. All patients presented within 2 weeks of their injury. For comparison purposes, we also obtained US images from 12 control subjects who had no history of nasal trauma or surgery. We found that we could confidently diagnose nasal fractures on lateral-view US on the basis of a disruption of bone continuity and/or displacement of fracture segments. However, our findings were not as consistent with dorsal-view US, and we do not believe it is adequate for diagnosis. We conclude that lateral US can be used to detect nasal fractures in adults, but further studies are needed to assess its sensitivity, specificity, cost-effectiveness, and practicality.",Excluded
1944,"The effect of oral administration of ursodeoxycholic acid and high-dose proton pump inhibitors on the histology of Barrett's esophagus. Bile acids may play a role in the pathogenesis of Barrett's esophagus (BE). Bile composition can be influenced by oral administration of ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA). We prospectively investigated the effect of proton pump inhibitors (PPI) supplemented with UDCA in vivo in patients with BE. Patients with no or low-grade dysplasia who were clinically asymptomatic on PPI were eligible for the study. In order to exclude the effects of acid reflux, all patients were initially treated with 40 mg esomeprazole (ESO) twice daily for 6 months and continued on this dose till the end of the study (t = 12 months). During a period of 6 months (t = 6 month - t = 12 month) patients were treated with oral UDCA (600 mg twice daily). Patients underwent endoscopy at t = 0 months, t = 6 months and t = 12 months with multiple biopsies of the distal and proximal BE segment, normal squamous and gastric cardia. In addition, pH was measured at t = 0 months and t = 6 months using a BRAVO wireless pH capsule. Bile was sampled at the beginning of the UDCA treatment and 6 months later (t = 6 month and t = 12 month). All biopsies were reviewed for the extent of metaplasia, dysplasia, and acute and chronic inflammation. In addition, proliferation (Ki67), differentiation (villin, cytokeratins 7 and 20) and inflammation (COX-2) were investigated by immunohistochemistry (IHC). Nine patients (mean age 60 years, median BE length 7 cm) were included, of whom six had no dysplasia and three had low-grade dysplasia. pH measurements revealed a normal acid exposure in most patients at t = 0 and t = 6 months. In addition, bile composition analysis demonstrated the efficacy of UDCA. Combining the results of both phases of the study, no significant changes were seen in any of the histological or IHC parameters. Differentiation and proliferation parameters showed no significant changes. In this study, in BE patients who were clinically asymptomatic on PPI, increasing the PPI dose to the maximum for 6 months followed by the addition of UDCA for 6 months did not result in significant histological or IHC changes in their BE.",Excluded

Background and Objectives: This study evaluated the treatment result of high dose stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) for colorectal oligometastases. Method(s): Between 2003 and 2009, 41 patients with 50 lesions confined to one organ from colorectal cancer (CRC) and treated with high dose SBRT <=45 Gy were retrospectively reviewed. Lymph nodes (LNs) (18 patients) were the most frequent sites followed in order by lung (12) and liver (11). SBRT doses ranged from 45 to 60 Gy in three fractions (median 48 Gy). The cumulative gross tumor volume (GTV) ranged from 2 to 123 ml (median 13 ml). Result(s): The median follow-up period from the SBRT date was 28 months (range, 6-65 months). The 3-year local control and overall survival rates were 64 and 60%, and the respective 5-year rates were 57 and 38%. Cumulative GTV and SBRT dose were statistically significant prognostic factors for local control. The grade 3 or 4 complications occurred in three patients (7%). Conclusion(s): High dose SBRT for colorectal oligometastases was found to produce results comparable with surgical series. To improve local control, dose higher than 48 Gy are recommend when possible, but further study will be required to define the optimal normal tissue constraints and acceptable toxicity.

3352,"Salivary gland cancer in the United States. The risk of salivary gland cancer (SGC) is increased in atomic bomb survivors and after radiotherapy, but other risk factors are not well established. Some studies have suggested an association of SGC with breast cancer and with exposure to various viruses or UVB radiation. Corroborating evidence of these associations was sought by using population-based registries to examine the demographic distribution of SGC, patterns of secondary primary cancers after SGC, and risk of SGC with AIDS. SGC incidence per 100,000 persons did not change between 1973 and 1992, averaging 1.2 in males and 0.8 in females, with a steep age gradient. To examine the relationship between UVB exposure and SGC, population-based, age-adjusted incidence rates of SGC were plotted against the UVB insolation of each registry site. Regression analysis suggested no correlation between SGC incidence and increasing UVB insolation (beta = 0.10, R2 = 0.08). SGC also did not appear to be associated with second cancers that have been linked to herpes or papilloma viruses or with AIDS [observed/expected (O/E) ratio, <2.8], but all of these conditions are so uncommon that only very large relative risks would have been statistically significant. Women with SGC before age 35 had a statistically nonsignificant elevation in breast cancer risk [O/E, 3.30; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.66-9.65], and older women had no increased risk of breast cancer. SGC patients were at increased risk for nonsalivary, second-primary oropharyngeal cancers (O/E, 3.27; 95% CI, 2.00-5.05), thyroid cancer (O/E, 3.31; 95% CI, 1,07-7.73), and lung cancer (O/E, 1.86; 95% CI, 1.45-2.35), particularly in patients whose SGC was treated with radiotherapy (O/E, 2.83; 95% CI, 2.06-3.80). In summary, SGC remains rare and does not appear to be associated with AIDS, virally related malignancies, or UVB. Patients who have had SGC, however, should be monitored for subsequent oropharyngeal, thyroid, and lung cancers.",Excluded
3026,"The role of curative radiotherapy in the treatment of lung cancer. From 1963-1974, 141 patients with lung cancer were treated with curative intent in the A. Maxwell Evans Clinic in Vancouver. The clinical presentation, age and sex distribution, histology, and reasons for surgery not being carried out are examined. The results of this treatment are presented. An attempt has been made to isolate a group of patients who have a better prognosis so that treatment selection can be improved. Hemoptysis, cough, dyspnea, and incidental finding on routine chest x-ray were the most common manner of presentation. Thirty-four percent of the patients were over 70 years of age and 13% were women. The crude overall three- and five-year survival rates were 18 and 10% (19 and 9% in the men, 17 and 14% in the women). Patients presenting with dyspnea had a better survival than those presenting with cough and hemoptysis. Patients with lesions less than 3 cm in diameter had a 28% three-year survival, compared with 14% for lesions greater than 5 cm in diameter. The three- and five-year survival rates in patients over 70 years of age were 23 and 17% respectively.

New effective therapies are greatly needed for metastatic uveal melanoma, which has a very poor prognosis with a median survival of less than 1 y. The melanocortin 1 receptor (MC1R) is expressed in 94% of uveal melanoma metastases, and a MC1R-specific ligand (MC1RL) with high affinity and selectivity for MC1R was previously developed. Methods: The 225Ac-DOTA-MC1RL conjugate was synthesized in high radiochemical yield and purity and was tested in vitro for biostability and for MC1R-specific cytotoxicity in uveal melanoma cells, and the lanthanum-DOTA-MC1RL analog was tested for binding affinity. Non-tumor-bearing BALB/c mice were tested for maximum tolerated dose and biodistribution. Severe combined immunodeficient mice bearing uveal melanoma tumors or engineered MC1R-positive and -negative tumors were studied for biodistribution and efficacy. Radiation dosimetry was calculated using mouse biodistribution data and blood clearance kinetics from Sprague-Dawley rat data. Results: High biostability, MC1R-specific cytotoxicity, and high binding affinity were observed. Limiting toxicities were not observed at even the highest administered activities. Pharmacokinetics and biodistribution studies revealed rapid blood clearance (<15 min), renal and hepatobillary excretion, MC1R-specific tumor uptake, and minimal retention in other normal tissues. Radiation dosimetry calculations determined pharmacokinetics parameters and absorbed alpha-emission dosages from 225Ac and its daughters. Efficacy studies demonstrated significantly prolonged survival and decreased metastasis burden after a single administration of 225Ac-DOTA-MC1RL in treated mice relative to controls. Conclusion: These results suggest significant potential for the clinical translation of 225Ac-DOTA-MC1RL as a novel therapy for metastatic uveal melanoma.

782,"Case report: Asymptomatic ventricular fibrillation and ineffective high energy therapy in a patient with left ventricular non compaction cardiomyopathy and left ventricular assist device. BACKGROUND We present a case of asymptomatic ventricular fibrillation and ineffective defibrillation in a patient with left ventricular non compaction cardiomyopathy after left ventricular assist device (LVAD) Heart Mate III. Non compaction cardiomyopathy is a rare, congenital cardiomyopathy resulting from abnormal embryogenesis of myocardium with characteristic multiple trabeculations in ventricular apex. Its lethal character comes from frequent ventricular arrhythmias, often also with atrio ventricular conduction block. The main role of treatment is to improve cardiac efficiency, reduce the risk of arrhythmias, implant of an automatic implantable cardioverter defibrillator for prevention of sudden cardiac death, ventricular assist device and heart transplant in cases of serious heart failure. CASE REPORT 61 year old patient with severe heart failure (LVEF 16%), diagnosed in 2012. In the course of non compaction cardiomyopathy after cardiac resynchronization therapy with defibrillation function in February 2018 and implantation left ventricular mechanical cardiac assistant LVAD with Heart Mate III system on 27.06.2019. The patient had 5 discharges of the device in a church without loss of consciousness and symptoms of apparent circulatory failure on 27.10.2019. The patient was admitted to the Emergency Department in fair general condition, with basal crepitations over the lungs audible, slight dyspnea at rest, with ongoing Torsade de pointes in electrocardiographic examination, with ventricular rate 300/min, and blood pressure 100/60 Hg mm. Ventricular fibrillation was interrupted by external defibrillator, achieving sinus rhythm return. Basic examination results showed elevated proBNP values (4362 ng/l), features of pulmonary stasis on X ray. CRT D device memory showed 5 unsuccessful discharges of the device, followed by external effective defibrillation after exhausting all available high energy therapies, which restored sinus rhythm and synchronous biventricular stimulation. The patient was discharged home in good condition. CONCLUSIONS Ineffective high energy therapy in many cases ends in death. In this case, despite the abnormal electrical heart rate, LVAD was working correctly and ensured proper cardiovascular function.",Excluded

Seventeen patients had adjuvant or palliative EBRT delivered to 41 sites. Six patients initially had adjuvant EBRT (median, 60.80 Gy); none had relapse in the treated area. Five patients with locoregional recurrence after surgery were treated (median, 59.40 Gy), and durable disease control was achieved in 3. Twelve patients received palliative EBRT to 29 sites of metastatic disease (median, 30.00 Gy), which provided sustained symptom relief at 45% of sites. Five- and tenyear overall survival rates were 44% and 19%, respectively. Adjuvant EBRT may be most effective for prevention of locoregional recurrence.

PURPOSE: We aimed to compare the size-specific dose estimates (SSDE), computed tomography (CT) dose indices and image quality parameters of the chest CTs obtained with fast kilovoltage-switching (FKS) dual-energy (DE) CT versus those with single-energy (SE) CT., METHODS: Patients who had chest SECT within the last 6 months were prospectively scanned with chest FKS-DECT. Quantitative comparison was made by calculating the mean SSDE, CTDIvol, contrast, noise, contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR), and signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) for both acquisitions. Two radiologists evaluated the chest SECT and DECT images qualitatively blinded to the technique used. The paired Student's t test was utilized for comparing the quantitative and qualitative data.

Method(s): A total of 72 patients with locally advanced esophageal squamous cell carcinoma, which were admitted to our hospital from October 2011 to December 2013, were retrospectively analyzed in this study. Result(s): Thirty-six patients (50%) were treated with IMRT alone, while the other 36 patients (50%) were treated by IMRT combined with chemotherapy containing liposomal paclitaxel and cisplatin. Patients treated with chemoradiotherapy showed significantly superior overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) compared to patients treated with IMRT alone (median OS: respectively, 29.7 vs. 12.9 months, P=0.0287; median PFS: respectively, 14.0 vs. 6.5 months, P=0.0186).

Background: It is unclear whether differentiated thyroid cancer (DTC) patients classified as intermediate risk based on the presence of microscopic extrathyroidal extension (ETE) should be treated with low or high doses of radioiodine (RAI) after surgery. We evaluated success rates and long-term clinical outcomes of patients with DTC of small tumor size, microscopic ETE, and no cervical lymph node (LN) metastasis treated either with a low (1.1GBq) or high RAI dose (5.5GBq). Method(s): This is a retrospective analysis of a historical cohort from 2000 to 2010 in a tertiary referral hospital. A total of 176 patients with small (<=2cm) DTC, microscopic ETE, and no cervical LN metastasis were included. Ninety-six patients were treated with 1.1GBq (LO group) and 80 patients with 5.5GBq (HI group). Successful RAI therapy was defined as (i) negative stimulated thyroglobulin (Tg) in the absence of Tg antibodies, and (ii) absence of remnant thyroid tissue and of abnormal cervical LNs on ultrasonography. Clinical recurrence was defined as the reappearance of disease after ablation, which was confirmed by cytologically or pathologically proven malignant tissue or of distant metastatic lesions. Result(s): There was no significant difference in the rate of successful RAI therapy between the LO and HI groups (p=0.75). In a subgroup analysis based on tumor size, success rates were not different between the LO group (34/35, 97%) and the HI group (50/56, 89%) in patients with a tumor size of 1-2cm (p=0.24). In patients with smaller tumor size (<=1cm), there was no significant difference in success rates between the LO (59/61, 97%) and HI groups (22/24, 92%; p=0.30).

The rising incidence of malignant melanoma of the skin was reviewed using data from the Connecticut Tumor Registry (1935-1974) (Eisenberg et al., 1967) and the Danish Cancer Registry (1943-1972) (Clemmesen, 1965, 1974, 1977). A total of 7,530 cases were analyzed according to age, sex and anatomic site. The total age-adjusted incidence rates were similar for these two areas, despite geographic and demographic differences. However, the most rapid changes in melanoma incidence were observed in females from Denmark and males from Connecticut. In addition, the largest increases occurred for lower-extremity lesions in Danish middle-aged women and trunk-neck melanomas in Connecticut middle-aged men. Melanoma of the face was resistant to changing incidence and occurred in an older age group than melanoma of other skin sites. In general, birth cohort analysis confirmed that changing incidence began for persons born around 1900, but the rising incidence for lower-extremity melanomas in women and trunk-neck melanomas in males began earlier. In comparing incidence for anatomic sites by correcting for surface area and melanocyte density, higher than expected rates were seen for melanoma of the face in both sexes and trunk-neck melanomas in males. The data presented supported the concept that a cumulative exposure to solar radiation may be important in the etiology of melanoma of the face, but short, intense sun exposure is probably related to melanoma in other sun-exposed areas, and that melanoma in areas other than the face is responsible for the rising incidence of this disease.",Excluded

Furthermore, we misled to compare the session number performed and the side effects produced by the two techniques., METHODS: Sixty-five eyes with HRPDR of 50 consecutive patients were enrolled in a prospective randomized controlled trial. In eyes selected for light PRP, a very light biomicroscopic effect on the retina was obtained for each spot. In eyes assigned to classic PRP, each spot produced a white-yellow biomicroscopic effect. Mean follow-up was 22.4 months +/- 9.7 in the light PRP and 21.6 months +/- 9.3 in the classic PRP group (p = 0.727)., RESULTS: The initial mean logMAR visual acuity (VA) in the light PRP group was 0.12 +/- 0.13 and in the classic PRP group 0.14 +/- 0.15 (p = 0.493). The final mean VA in the former was 0.18 +/- 0.25, and in the latter 0.27 +/- 0.30 (p = 0.231). Median power was 235mW (100-540mW) for light and 420mW (200-950mW) for classic PRP (p < 0.001).

This work describes the equipment, procedures, and quality assurance (QA) that enables successful administration., METHODS AND MATERIALS: This work describes the nasobiliary catheter placement, simulation, treatment planning, treatment delivery, and QA. In addition, a chart review was performed of all patients who received endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography for HDR bile duct brachytherapy at our institution from 2007 to 2017. The review evaluated how many patients were treated and the number of patients who could not be treated because of anatomic and/or equipment limitations., RESULTS: From 2007 to 2017, 122 cholangiocarcinoma patients have been treated with HDR brachytherapy using a nasobiliary catheter. Three patients underwent catheter placement but did not receive brachytherapy treatment due to catheter migration between placement and treatment or because the HDR afterloader was unable to extend the source wire into the treatment site. Periodic QA is recommended for ensuring whether the HDR afterloader is capable of extending the source wire through an extensive and curved path., CONCLUSIONS: Intraluminal HDR brachytherapy with a nasobiliary catheter can be successfully administered.

790,"Energy and thermal regulation during bed rest and spaceflight. In planning for long-duration (1- to 2-yr) space missions (microgravity), the availability of oxygen, water, and food is critical for survival. If astronauts would consume approximately 3,100 kcal and 2.2 liters of fluid per day, the requirements for a 2-yr flight would be 2,263,000 kcal and 1,606 liters for each astronaut. These estimates, based on limited microgravity simulation and flight data, include 1 h/day of moderate isotonic exercise. Each 30-min/day reduction in exercise training time would save 110,869 kcal and 91 liters of water per year. One daily 5-h extravehicular sortie at an average work rate of 1.7 l/min would require an additional 529,250 kcal and 1,095 liters of water per year. Results from microgravity simulation (bed rest) experiments suggest that 1) there is uncertainty whether basal metabolism is unchanged, 2) submaximal ergometer exercise oxygen uptake appears to be unchanged or lower, and 3) without vigorous exercise training near peak levels, the peak oxygen uptake is definitely reduced. In addition, the equilibrium level of exercise core temperature is elevated excessively by approximately 0.5 degrees C after bed-rest acclimation. Changes in the efficiency of work or metabolism in any or all of these conditions could affect nutritional requirements for long spaceflights. Further research is necessary to elucidate the metabolic factors that would be changed and the energy cost of intra- and extravehicular activity during prolonged exposure to microgravity.",Excluded
1921,"In balloon kyphoplasty for osteoporotic vertebral body fractures, the potential of reduction is depending on the time to surgery. PURPOSE: For the treatment of osteoporotic vertebral body fractures, balloon kyphoplasty has been shown to be highly efficient in pain reduction. This technique can restore patient mobility and enhance quality of life. Fracture reduction is resulting in part from positioning of the patient and from balloon expansion. This prospective study tries to investigate whether the potential of reduction is depending on the time to surgery in these patients. METHOD(S): Inclusion criteria: t-score < 1.0, thoracolumbar fractures types. Exclusion criteria: more than two fractures, previous fractures, additional posterior instrumentation, age > 90 years, cardiac arrhythmia. 71 patients (47 female, 24 male; average age 74 years) with 101 fractures were included. 62 patients concluded followup (FU) at 2 years post op. The following clinical and radiological data were collected pre and post op, after 6 weeks, and after 3, 6, 12 and 24 months: Bisegmental endplate angle, anterior vertebral body height, Visual-Analog-Score (VAS; 0 no pain; 100 worst possible pain), Oswestry-Disability-Questionnaire (ODQ). Surgical technique follows the standard protocol for balloon-kyphoplasty (Medtronic). Fractures were defined acute, if fracture age was less than two weeks. Fractures were defined chronic, if fracture age was two weeks or more. Conventional X-rays were provided in an upright position during all post op FU visits. RESULT(S): 61 patients suffered from osteoporosis, 10 from osteopenia. For the acute fracture group (n=54), bisegmental endplate angle was improved by 8,6degree on average. For the chronic fracture group (n=47), however, bisegmental endplate angle was improved by 3,7degree only. This difference between groups is statistically significant (p<0.05). For the acute fracture group, anterior vertebral body height was restored from 48% to 81% (p<0.05). For the chronic fracture group, anterior vertebral body height was restored from 41% to 60% (not significant). CONCLUSION(S): If osteoporotic vertebral body fractures are being surgically treated within the first two weeks of injury, restoration of the sagittal spinal profile is significantly improved as compared to older fracture age. The pain reducing effect of the procedure, however, occurs independent of fracture age. As the leading clinical sign for osteoporotic fracture augmentation is persistent pain, cement injection remains an option even in older fractures with reduced potential for sagittal correction.",Excluded
2216,"Comparative study of planimetry for patients with 3 brain metastases treated with Cyberknife: Treatment of 3 lesions separately versus 3 simultaneous lesions. Introduction. The aim of this study is to compare the irradiation of three brain lesions treated as consecutive and mono-fractionated to the Cyberknife with simultaneous treatment including the 3 lesions. Methods. We study in this work 12 patients with 3 brain lesions who each have been processed at the dose of 20 Gy in 1 fraction. These small tumors (mean 8 cc: min 0.4 cc, max 3.5 cc) were distant from each other. We realized after the fact a planimetry including the three lesions for a simultaneous treatment. To do this, we create a PTV Global volume on which we apply our dose constraints. We then compare the coverage, dosimetric indices (conformity index, homogeneity index, gradient), the processing time and doses to the brain. This study will allow us on the one hand, to assess the feasibility of the treatment, and on the other hand to propose the planimetry to the doctor according to the patient's case. To improve and secure our study, each patient received a double dosimetry performed by two different operators through the Multiplan planning console, which is dedicated to the Cyberknife. Results. The duration of the sessions for the 3 lesions treated simultaneously is acceptable for the patient with values between 45 min and 63 min (mean 55 min), which corresponds to an average increase of 71% (7-127%). This processing time is still acceptable and the simultaneous treatment is time saving for the machine since we have a discrepancy between these two treatment schemes, with an average gain of 83% (59-147%). We evaluated doses received by the healthy brain in the two schemes: V12 Gy, V10 Gy, V8 Gy, V5 Gy. Conclusions. In the context of the increase of small brain metastases treatment, the current trend is clearly towards hypofractionated treatment of the multi-localizations compared to the treatment of the whole of the brain. The comparison of the two treatment schemes allows us to propose in the future the solution of simultaneous treatment.",Excluded
1092,"Cone-beam CT with flat-panel-detector digital angiography system: early experience in abdominal interventional procedures. We developed a cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT) system equipped with a large flat-panel detector. Data obtained by 200 degree rotation imaging are reconstructed by means of CBCT to generate three-dimensional images. We report the use of CBCT angiography using CBCT in 10 patients with 8 liver malignancies and 2 hypersplenisms during abdominal interventional procedures. CBCT was very useful for interventional radiologists to confirm a perfusion area of the artery catheter wedged on CT by injection of contrast media through the catheter tip, although the image quality was slightly degraded, scoring as 2.60 on average by streak artifacts. CBCT is space-saving because it does not require a CT system with a gantry, and it is also time-saving because it does not require the transfer of patients.",Excluded
2040,"Long-term outcome and patterns of failure in primary ocular adnexal MALT lymphoma treated with radiotherapy. Purpose/Objective(s): MALT lymphomas have generally been believed to follow a relatively indolent course and show a tendency to remain localized within their original environment for a long period of time. Therefore, there has been no consensus regarding the initial management of primary ocular adnexal MALT lymphoma (POAML) so far; radiotherapy has been generally considered the most effective treatment for localized disease. Although results from local control by radiotherapy were satisfying, disease progression occurred in a fraction of the patients. There have been few analyses on its behavior of progression and death that focused on patients with POAML. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the long-term treatment outcome and disease behavior of POAML. Materials/Methods: Seventy-eight patients (42 male and 36 female) diagnosed with POAML between 1991 and 2010 at Kobe University Hospital were included. The median age was 60-years old (range: 22 - 85). The median radiation dose administered was 30.6 Gy. Survival data were calculated using the Kaplan-Meier method. Result(s): The median follow-up duration was 65 months. Major tumor sites were conjunctivas in 37 (47%), orbita in 29 (37%), and lacrimal glands in 12 (15%) patients. The 5- and 10-year local control (LC) rates were both 100%, and the 5- and 10-year recurrence- free survival (RFS) rates were 88.5% and 75.9%, respectively. The 5- and 10-year overall survival (OS) rates were 98.1% and 95.3%, respectively. Patients treated with a combination of radiotherapy and chemotherapy had a trend for a better RFS compared to those treated with radiotherapy alone (p = 0.114). None developed greater than G2 acute morbidity. For late morbidities, retinal disorders occurred in 7 patients (9%), glaucoma in 1 (1%), dry eye in 4 (5%), and cataracts in 37 (47%). Conclusion(s): Radiotherapy for POAML was shown to be highly effective and safe for local control and overall survival based on long-term observation. Our results in disease progression revealed important aspects for future strategies in the management of POAML.",Excluded
725,"MediGuide in supraventricular tachycardia: Initial experience from a multicentre registry. AimsCurrently, fluoroscopy-based catheter visualization is the standard modality in invasive electrophysiological procedures. Recently a new technology for non-fluoroscopic visualization of diagnostic (since 2010) and ablation catheters (since May 2012) has been introduced. The MediGuideTM-Technology (MediGuide) projects catheter tips on prerecorded cine loops in a high time resolution.Methods and resultsWe report on MediGuide-based supraventricular tachycardia (SVT) cases [atrioventricular nodal reentry tachycardia (AVNRT), atrioventricular reentry tachycardia (AVRT), Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome (WPW), ectopic atrial tachycardia (EAT) and typical atrial flutter) from two European centres. In all patients, diagnostic and/or ablation catheters with a special sensor were used to perform the ablation procedures. All procedural data such as acute success, duration of the procedure, fluoroscopy time, and dose and patients' characteristics were analyzed and compared with conventionally ablated patients (n = 1865). Procedure-related complications during the hospital stay were recorded. A total of 24 consecutive patients were analyzed: no significant difference to the control group was seen in the baseline characteristics. The MediGuide patients were predominantly male (66%), aged 58 +/- 14 years and were ablated for 6 AVNRT (25%), 4 AVRT/WPW (17%), 1 EAT (4%), and 13 typical atrial flutter (54%). The acute success rate was 100% (98% in the control group, n.s.). The median fluoroscopy time was 0.5 +/- 1.4 min (10.2 +/- 9.6 in the control group, P < 0.001), the median fluoroscopy dose was 187 +/- 554 cGy cm2 (996 +/- 2593 cGy cm2, P < 0.05). Mean procedure time was 70 +/- 25 min (60 +/- 36 min, n.s.). No complications during the hospital stay were recorded.ConclusionIn several different forms of supraventricular tachycardias the MediGuide-Technology contributed to a dramatic reduction in irradiation exposure. With a median fluoroscopy time of 30 s all SVT cases were effectively performed with no complications; the fluoroscopy burden can be significantly reduced not only for the patient but also for the nurses and the physicians performing the case. The overall procedure times are not prolonged due to the use of MediGuide Technology compared with a control group of >1800 patients undergoing conventional ablation procedures. © 2013 The Author.",Excluded
1917,"Automated synthesis and dosimetry of 6-deoxy-6-[18F]fluoro-D-fructose (6-[18F]FDF): A radiotracer for imaging of GLUT5 in breast cancer. 6-Deoxy-6-[18F]fluoro-D-fructose (6-[18F]FDF) is a promising PET radiotracer for imaging GLUT5 in breast cancer. The present work describes GMP synthesis of 6-[18F]FDF in an automated synthesis unit (ASU) and dosimetry calculations to determine radiation doses in humans. GMP synthesis and dosimetry calculations are important prerequisites for first-in-human clinical studies of 6-[18F]FDF. The radiochemical synthesis of 6-[18F]FDF was optimized and adapted to an automated synthesis process using a Tracerlab FXFN ASU (GE Healthcare). Starting from 30 GBq of cyclotron-produced n.c.a. [18F]fluoride, 2.9 +/- 0.1 GBq of 6-[18F]FDF could be prepared within 50 min including HPLC purification resulting in an overall decay-corrected radiochemical yield of 14 +/- 3% (n = 11). Radiochemical purity exceeded 95%, and the specific activity was greater than 5.1 GBq/mumol. Sprague-Dawley rats were used for biodistribution experiments, and dynamic and static small animal PET experiments. Biodistribution studies served as basis for allometric extrapolation to the standard man anatomic model and normal organ-absorbed dose calculations using OLINDA/EXM software. The calculated human effective dose for 6-[18F]FDF was 0.0089 mSv/MBq. Highest organ doses with a dose equivalent of 0.0315 mSv/MBq in a humans were found in bone. Injection of 370 MBq (10 mCi) of 6-[18F]FDF results in an effective whole body radiation dose of 3.3 mSv in humans, a value comparable to that of other 18F-labeled PET radiopharmaceuticals. The optimized automated synthesis under GMP conditions, the good radiochemical yield and the favorable human radiation dosimetry estimates support application of 6-[18F]FDF in clinical trials for molecular imaging of GLUT5 in breast cancer patients.",Excluded
2580,"Concurrent chemotherapy and reduced-dose cranial spinal irradiation followed by posterior fossa tumor bed boost for average-risk medulloblastoma: Efficacy and Patterns of Failure. Purpose/Objective(s): To review the efficacy and patterns of failure in average-risk medulloblastoma patients treated with concurrent chemotherapy and cranial spinal irradiation and a conformal tumor bed boost. Materials/Methods: Fifty-four patients with average-risk (defined as <1.5 cm2 of residual tumor after resection, age >3 years, and no involvement of the cerebrospinal fluid or spine [M0]) medulloblastoma were treated at our institution between January 1994 and December 2009. The median age at diagnosis of the 54 patients was 7 years (range, 3-21 years). The male/female patient ratio was 3.5:1. Patients were treated with concurrent chemotherapy (vincristine) and reduced-dose cranial spinal irradiation (2340 cGy) followed by a conformal primary tumor bed boost (3060 cGy to 3600 cGy, 47 patients received 3240 cGy). Eight patients were treated with IMRT boost plans and 46 patients were treated with 3D conformal boost plans. After radiation therapy patients were to be treated with 8 cycles of chemotherapy (vincristine, cisplatin, and lomustine or cyclophosphamide). The median follow-up was 68 months (range, 0-179 months). Result(s): The 5-year Kaplan-Meier estimated overall survival rate was 85% (+/-10.8%, 95% confidence interval). The 5-year disease free survival and freedom from posterior fossa recurrence were 81% (+/-11.6%, 95% confidence interval) and 94% (+/-7.0%, 95% confidence interval), respectively. Ten patients had disease recurrences. The patterns of first site of failure included 1 patient with distal central nervous system recurrence, 3 patients with recurrence in the tumor bed boost fields, 1 patient with simultaneous recurrences in the tumor bed boost fields and distal central nervous system, and 5 patients with leptomeningeal disease. No failures occurred elsewhere in the posterior fossa. Conclusion(s): The treatment of average-risk medulloblastoma with chemotherapy, reduced-dose cranial spinal irradiation, and a conformal tumor bed boost results in survival rates and primary site control rates comparable to those in contemporary studies. Patterns of recurrence suggest that a limited tumor bed boost and whole posterior fossa dose of 2340 cGy does not compromise OS or DFS. The presence of leptomeningeal recurrences with the reduced dose posterior fossa fields is similar to what has been observed in other studies and raises concern for further cranial spinal dose reductions.",Excluded

Abstract Background By nature of their specialty, otolaryngologists are disproportionately exposed to coronavirus disease 2019 through aerosol-generating procedures and close proximity to the oropharynx during examination. Methods Our single-centre, retrospective study analysed the pertinence of guidelines produced by ENT UK to improve the investigation and management of suspected upper aerodigestive fish bone foreign bodies during the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic. Results Our results demonstrated 43.3 per cent (n = 13) low-risk cases and 56.7 per cent (n = 17) moderate-risk cases. Nine fish bones (two low risk, seven moderate risk) were found; none of these were confirmed with X-ray and three (moderate risk) required nasoendoscopy for diagnosis. One patient required rigid pharyngoscopy. Conclusion This study confirms that soft tissue neck X-ray and flexible nasoendoscopy are unnecessary in low-risk cases; however, early nasoendoscopy in higher suspicion cases is appropriate. Recommendations are made about the long-term sustainability of these guidelines, and additional measures are encouraged that relate to repeat attendances and varying prevalence of coronavirus disease 2019 in the hospital catchment area.Copyright © The Author(s), 2021.

3347,"Radio-resistant recipient bone marrow (BM) macrophages (MACS) are necessary for hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) engraftment post transplantation. For decades it has been assumed that lethal irradiation in bone marrow transplantation experiments ablates the entire host hematopoietic system but preserves the host non-hematopoietic bone marrow stroma. This postulate is at the basis of transplantation chimera experiments in mice to test involvement of hematopoietic cells versus non-hematopoietic stroma. As BM-Macs support HSC niche homeostasis, we examined whether host-derived BM-Macs persist lethal irradiation and play a role in HSC engraftment. Recipient MacGreen mice (expressing GFP in myeloid cells under the control of Csf1r promoter) were lethally irradiated (11.5Gy) and transplanted with sorted syngeneic B6.SJL CD45.1+ Lin-Kit+Sca1+ sorted cells. Flow cytometry analyses of BM 2-30 weeks (wk) post-transplant confirmed more than 99% donor chimerism of monocytes and granulocytes validating ablation of recipient HSC. In contrast, GFP+CD11b+F4/80+CD169+VCAM-1+ERHR3+Ly6Gneg recipient BM-Macs were detected throughout the time-course. A 5.9 fold expansion of these recipient BM-Macs occurred between wk 2 and 5 (from 45,000 to 270,000 cells/femur) post-transplant which coincided with increased number of phenotypic donor HSC (GFP-Lin-Kit+Sca1+CD48-CD150+). Host BM-Mac proliferation was cell autonomous in the absence of host HSC and granulocytes. Recipient Macs in spleen displayed different frequency and longevity kinetics that correlated with transient post-Tx splenic extramedullary haematopoiesis. In situ, GFP+F480+ recipient BM-Macs were enriched in perivascular microenvironments within both central BM and endosteal regions. These GFP+ host-derived macrophages persisted long-term forming 8.4% of BM macrophages 7months post-transplant. To evaluate the importance of these host-derived radiation-resistant macrophages, we selectively depleted recipient BM-Macs using CD169-DTR mice transplanted with syngeneic ubiquitous GFP+ HSC. Depletion of recipient CD169+ Macs abated engraftment of donor phenotypic HSC by 70% at 5 wk post-transplant and reduced BM reconstitution potential in competitive secondary transplants. In conclusion BM contains a myeloablation-resistant self-repopulating Mac subset that is necessary for efficient and/or sustained HSC BM engraftment following transplantation. Therefore interpretation of transplantation chimera experiments must take into account the persistence of this subset of host macrophages that support donor HSC engraftment.",Excluded

Background: The role of irinotecan for elderly patients with LD-SCLC has been unclear, and the timing of TRT combined with chemotherapy has not been fully evaluated. Method(s): Patients aged > 70 years with untreated, measurable, LD-SCLC, performance status (PS) 0-2, and adequate organ function were eligible. Treatment consisted of induction with carboplatin on day 1 and irinotecan on days 1 and 8, every 21 days for 4 cycles, and sequential TRT (54Gy in 27 fractions). Carboplatin doses were based on AUC of 4 and 5 (levels 1 and 2, respectively), with a fixed irinotecan dose (50 mg/m2). Primary objective of the phase II study was overall responce rate. Result(s): Forty-three patients were enrolled and forty-one were finally analyzed (median age: 75 years [range 70-86 years); males 31; PS 0/1/2, n = 22/18/1]. Two patients were excluded because of protocol violation (ascertained to be extensive disease). Twelve patients were accrued at phase I and the number of patients with carboplatin dose-limiting toxicities at levels-1 (n = 6) and -2 (n = 6) were 1(grade 3 hypertension) and 2 (grade 4 thrombocytopenia), respectively. The phase II trial was expanded to 29 additional patients receiving the level 1 carboplatin dose, total of 35 patients. The median number of chemotherapy cycles was 4 (range 1-4), and the median radiation dose was 54Gy (range 36-60). Toxicities were generally mild. There were 4 complete and 27 partial responses (response rate 88.6%). With a median follow-up of 52 months, the median progression-free and overall survival times of phase II were 11.2 and 27.1 months, respectively.

1974,"Relationship between body composition and development of diabetes in non-obese Japanese subjects. Background : Body mass index (BMI) is a simple and good index to detect individuals with high risk of developing diabetes, though not all obese people develop diabetes. In comparison with populations in USA and Europe, Asian populations have a lower frequency of obesity, and a relatively higher risk of diabetes in non-obese populations. Although epidemiology studies reveal association between body composition and cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factors, very few studies have examined the relationship between body composition and these risk factors in non-obese subjects. Objectives : The purpose of this prospective cohort study was to examine association of body composition with incidence of diabetes, a CVD risk factor, in non-obese Japanese subjects. Methods : The subjects of this study were 1,137 non-obese subjects without diabetes at baseline (368 males and 769 females, with an average age of 65.2) in the Hiroshima Adult Health Study that consists of atomic bomb survivors and their controls. Body composition was estimated by whole body DXA during the period from 1994 through 1996. We used percentages of trunk, leg, and arm fat in relation to total soft tissue mass as surrogate indicators of body fat distribution, and the ratio of appendicular lean mass/height2 (ALM/H2) as a surrogate indicator of appendicular muscle mass volume. Diabetes was defined by fasting glucose >=126mg/dl (7.0 mmol/L) or random glucose >= 200 mg/dL (11.1 mmol/L), a history of diabetes diagnosis by a medical institution, or current treatment for diabetes. Results : During the follow-up period lasting until 2011, 133 subjects developed diabetes. In Cox regression analyses with adjustment for BMI, presence of hypertension and dyslipidemia, radiation dose, and smoking and alcohol consumption status, significant negative association was observed between ALM/H2 and diabetes risk in men. Regarding body fat distribution, trunk fat percentage was positively associated with the incidence of diabetes and it was statistically significant only in men. On the other hand, leg fat percentage was significantly and negatively associated with the incidence of diabetes in women. . Significant association between the percentage of arm fat and diabetes risk was not observed in either gender. Conclusions : Among non-obese subjects, we found body composition to be associated with diabetes risk. Therefore, for Japanese people, body composition may be a useful tool for identifying individuals with high risk of developing diabetes.",Excluded

Background and purpose: Radiotherapy is known to produce long-term skeletal complications. We aim to evaluate the biomechanical effect on femoral neck bone from hypothetical eccentric loads on pre- and post-radiotherapy CT-images for patients treated for rectal cancer. Material(s) and Method(s): Pre- and post-radiotherapy CT-images of rectal cancer from 10 patients were selected randomly. The cortical and trabecular bone was segmented by hand. The biomechanical simulations of 4 eccentric loads and one load aligned with the femoral neck axis were completed using finite element analysis (FEA) in both pre- and post-patient models. Result(s): A comparative statistical study was completed of pre- and post-radiotherapy patient models of stress and displacement factors. Significant differences were found in eccentric loads in both factors. Natural load has a significant difference in stress, but no differences were found for displacements. The absolute difference in eccentric load applied to the anterior area location on the same patient implies from 5.3% to 40.5% of the stress yield values reported in previous studies. Conclusion(s): Loads applied to the anterior area of the femoral head must be considered in fracture simulations because the percentage of yield stress of pre- and post-irradiated bones shows a significant biomechanical change.Copyright © 2021 Elsevier Inc.",Excluded
619,"NASA's space Launch System: Payload opportunities for lunar exploration, science missions. Nearing its first launch, the Space Launch System (SLS), NASA's new super heavy-lift launch vehicle, offers highly energetic launches that deliver more mass and provide more volume in 8.4 m-diameter and potentially larger fairings to make a new generation of deep space missions possible. An evolvable launcher available in crew, crew with a co-manifested payload (CPL) and cargo-only configurations, SLS is a crucial capability to enable astronauts to return to the Moon, but it also offers key benefits for science missions. NASA's 21st-century return to the Moon recently received a formal name: the Artemis program. In addition to the core enabling capabilities of SLS and the Orion crew spacecraft, NASA will also enlist international and commercial partnerships for Artemis. The Agency intends to build a scientific outpost in lunar orbit, the Gateway, from which human and robotic missions to and from the surface can rendezvous. SLS will launch Orion on a series of missions leading to landing the first woman and the next man on the Moon as part of Artemis. SLS uses proven propulsion systems: two solid rocket boosters and four RS-25s engines that have been upgraded to provide more thrust and operate in the SLS environment. SLS Block 1 uses a modified Delta IV Heavy upper stage, called the Interim Cryogenic Propulsion Stage (ICPS) and lifts at least 26 metric tons (t) to trans-lunar injection (TLI). The Block 1 vehicle can also be outfitted with a 5 m-diameter fairing. Block 1B, the next major variant, also uses solid rocket boosters and RS-25 engines to achieve Earth escape velocity, but replaces the single-engine liquid hydrogen (LH2)/liquid oxygen (LOX) ICPS with a four-engine LH2/LOX Exploration Upper Stage (EUS) to increase mass to TLI to 34-37 t, depending on crew or cargo configuration. In the Block 1B crew configuration, a 10 m-tall Universal Stage Adapter (USA) connects the vehicle to Orion and can carry a CPL up to 10 t. The USA provides 286 m3 of unpressurized volume for payloads. For large payloads, 8.4 m- and 10 m-diameter cargo fairings in 19.1 m and 27.4 m lengths are possible. The ultimate SLS vehicle, Block 2, incorporates evolved boosters to reach a lift capacity of more than 45 t to TLI. The capabilities of SLS not only make new missions to the Moon possible, but also game-changing science missions, such as deployment of large-aperture space telescopes, spacecraft to the ice giants or even probes to the interstellar medium. This paper will discuss the capabilities of SLS, the vehicle's planned evolution, missions that can effectively utilize the vehicle and manufacturing status of the vehicle.

1550,"Urological applications of computerized axial tomography. Computerized tomography (CT scanning) of the chest and abdomen has been used as a diagnostic technique in more than 7,200 patients since 1974, 250 of whom had histological proved disorders of the genitourinary system and retroperitoneum. On the basis of this experience CT scanning has been found to be safe and effective, and offers certain advantages over conventional techniques. The number, extent and content of adrenal and renal mass lesions can be determined with relatively great accuracy. The presence and extent of metastases into the retroperitoneum, liver and chest often can be shown by CT scanning when other tests are negative. Placement of needles for aspiration, biopsy, injection of contrast medium or insertion of drainage tubes can be done accurately under computerized tomographic control. Air contrast scanning of the bladder can be of real help in staging bladder tumors, espically in obese patients. Computerized tomography in itself is non-invasive, carries a low radiation exposure comparable to other radiographic procedures and therefore, can, be valuable in following the course of patients with various diseases during and after therapy. While CT scanning will not replace other diagnostic procedures it should lead to a more judicious selection of potentially hazardous tests, such as angiography, aspiration and open biopsy.",Excluded
3353,"Kypho-IORT: Intraoperative radiotherapy in spinal metastases: Nine-month clinical results. BACKGROUND CONTEXT: A new technique of combined kyphoplasty and intraoperative radiation therapy (Kypho-IORT) was introduced in 2010 [1]. The indication, rationale and possible advantages have been published in 2011 [2]. In the first clinical period several technical improvements and modifications could stabilize the method, its clinical feasibility and shortterm safety has been shown [3]. Due to the higher local radiation doses compared to extracorporal radiotherapy (EBRT) permitted by the steep dose fall off of the IORT-source a higher local tumor control can potentially be achieved by Kypho-IORT. In this study we present an intermediate prospective follow-up of 9-month after Kypho-IORT. PURPOSE: Local tumor control and clinical use of Kypho-IORT. STUDY DESIGN/SETTING: Evidence level IV: prospective case series. PATIENT SAMPLE: 62 patients suffering from 77 spinal metastases which were treated with Kypho-IORT were included in the prospective study. Data of 16 patients who finished the 4th follow-up appointment after around 9 months and were interpreted. OUTCOME MEASURES: Acquired basic data were gender, age at surgery, tumor entity, treated vertebral level, delivered dose. Prospective collected data were pain measure by visual analogue scale (VAS) preoperative and at follow-up, Karnofsky Index, local metastasis control in the treated vertebra and general progression of metastases by CT or MRI. METHOD(S): Clinical and radiographic follow-up examinations. RESULT(S): 16 patients (12 females, 4 males) with an average age of 61 years were included. Twelve patients had breast cancer, two patients suffered prostate cancer and one each with lung, ovarian and sigmoid cancer. Thirteen thoracic and 4 lumbar vertebrae were treated with an average surgical time of 70 minutes per vertebra. The time from surgery to the 9-month follow-up was in average 348 days. The Karnofsky index was constant with 87 preoperative versus 86 at follow-up. The VAS average decreased from 4.1 preoperative to 1.4 postoperative and 0.8 at follow-up. In all cases but two, a dose of 8gy in a radius of 5mm was delivered successfully, two cases with second dose level at 8gy in 8mm distance to isocenter. Three patients had a local progress, one patient due to incorrect indication. Two vertebrae needed open revision surgery; one local progress was treated only with EBRT. Eight patients showed a general tumor progress. CONCLUSION(S): Kypho-IORT can offer a fast postoperative pain reduction, immediate stabilization and prevention of secondary fractures in the treated vertebrae by kyphoplasty which could be confirmed in this small cohort. The VAS decreased postoperative and this level was maintained during follow-up. Local tumor control (indication failures ignored) by intraoperative radiation could be achieved in 87% of the vertebrae over the 9 months period, which seems to be better than single fraction radiation schedules and at least comparable to multiple fraction schedules of conventional radiation. Furthermore the Karnofsky-Index stayed constant over the follow-up period which proves the low morbidity of the intervention in short and in intermediate term. All 14 of 16 patients of the 9-month-follow- up were treated with the lowest calculated treatment dose; probably an even higher local tumor control is achievable by higher local radiation doses.These results warrant further evaluation of this technique by a dose escalation and a multicenter study, which is currently under way.",Excluded
1038,"Feasibility and safety of extended adjuvant temozolomide beyond six cycles for patients with glioblastoma. Introduction: Temozolomide is the first chemotherapeutic agent proven effective for patients with newly diagnosed glioblastoma. The drug is well tolerated for its low toxicity. The current standard practice is concomitant chemoradiotherapy for 6 weeks followed by 6 cycles of adjuvant temozolomide. Some Caucasian studies have suggested that patients might benefit from extended adjuvant cycles of temozolomide (>6 cycles) to lengthen both progression-free survival and overall survival. In the present study, we compared differences in survival and toxicity profile between patients who received conventional 6-cycle temozolomide and those who received more than 6 cycles of temozolomide. Method(s): Patients with newly diagnosed glioblastoma without progressive disease and completed concomitant chemoradiotherapy during a 4-year period were studied. Progression-free survival was compared using Kaplan-Meier survival curves. t Test, U test, and correlation were chosen accordingly to examine the impact of age, extent of resection, MGMT promoter methylation status and adjuvant cycles on progression-free survival. For factors with a P value of <0.05 in univariate analyses, Cox regression hazard model was adopted to determine the strongest factors related to progression-free survival. Result(s): The median progression-free survival was 17.0 months for patients who received 6 cycles of temozolomide (n=7) and 43.4 months for those who received more than 6 cycles (n=7) [P=0.007, log-rank test]. Two patients in the former group and one in the latter group encountered grade 1 toxicity and recovered following dose adjustment. Cycles of adjuvant temozolomide were correlated with progression-free survival (P=0.016, hazard ratio=0.68). Conclusion(s): Extended cycles of temozolomide are safe and feasible for Chinese patients with disease responsive to temozolomide.Copyright © 2017, Hong Kong Academy of Medicine Press.

1322,"Transfusion of irradiated red blood cell units with a potassium adsorption filter: A randomized controlled trial. BACKGROUND: The irradiation of red blood cells (RBCs) causes damage of the RBC membrane with increased potassium (K) leak during storage compared with nonirradiated RBC units of similar age. A previous in vitro study showed a mean reduction of K of 94 +/- 5% with a potassium adsorption filter (PAF)., STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: A prospective, single-center, nonblinded, randomized controlled trial (RCT) was designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of transfusing irradiated RBC units with the PAF.

Primary outcome measures were safety and efficacy of the PAF (absolute change in hemoglobin [Hb] and K, respectively, in patient's blood values after transfusing the irradiated RBC units with or without the PAF)., RESULTS: A total of 63 irradiated RBC units were transfused to 17 patients in the control group, and a total of 56 irradiated RBC units were transfused to 13 patients in the PAF group. The absolute change of Hb (9.3 +/- 6.3 g/L vs. 8.1 +/- 5.8 g/L; p = 0.3) and the absolute change of K (-0.01 +/- 0.4 mmol/L vs. -0.01 +/- 0.3 mmol/L; p = 0.2) were comparable between the two groups of the trial., CONCLUSION: The transfusion of 1 irradiated RBC unit with the PAF was as safe and efficacious as the transfusion of 1 irradiated RBC unit with the standard blood infusion set in patients with chemotherapy-induced anemia.

2266,"Role of radiation therapy in the treatment of stage I/II mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue lymphoma. Background: Few large studies exist on the outcome of patients treated for stage I/II mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) lymphoma. Patients and Methods: We retrospectively reviewed the records of 77 patients consecutively treated for stage I (n = 66) or II (n = 11) MALT lymphoma at our institution. Progression-free survival (PFS), freedom from treatment failure (FFTF), and overall survival (OS) were calculated using the Kaplan-Meier method. Result(s): The median follow-uptime was 61 months (range 2-177 months). Fifty-two patients (68%) received local radiation therapy (RT) alone, 17 (22%) had surgery followed by adjuvant RT, five (6%) had surgery alone, two (3%) had surgery and chemotherapy, and one patient had chemotherapy alone. The median RT dose was 30 Gy (range 18-40 Gy). The 5-year PFS, FFTF, and OS rates were 76%, 78%, and 91%, respectively. The 5-year PFS (79% versus 50%; P = 0.002) and FFTF (81% versus 50%; P = 0.0004) rates were higher for patients who received RT as compared with patients who did not. Conclusion(s): The prognosis following treatment of stage I/II MALT lymphoma is excellent. RT improves PFS and FFTF and has an important role in the curative treatment of patients with localized disease. © 2007 Oxford University Press.",Excluded
1450,"Irradiation field design according to locoregional relapse sites after radiotherapy of nasopharyngeal carcinoma. BACKGROUND & OBJECTIVE: The lateral faciocervical field, lateral facial field, and cerrobent blocks were employed conventionally in radiotherapy of nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) in Cancer Center of Sun Yat-sen University since 1990s. This study was to explore rationality of irradiated area of lateral faciocervical field and lateral facial field through analyzing the data of some patients presenting locoregional recurrence after conventional radiotherapy. METHOD(S): Clinical data of the patients, treated in 1999 and presented locoregional failure and had reports of CT examinations before and after radiotherapy and after recurrence, were reviewed. The regions of recurrent lesions were analyzed. Dosimetric analysis of recurrent regions was performed for the patients with available data of irradiating fields. If no less than 95% of the volume of local recurrent lesion was within 95% isodose curve, it was defined as in-field failure; 20% to less than 95% of the volume was within 95% isodose curve as marginal failure; less than 20% of the volume was within 95% isodose curve as out-field failure. RESULT(S): Clinical data of 40 patients could be analyzed, and dosimetric analysis of recurrent regions was performed for 15 patients. Local recurrences mainly occurred in the nasopharyngeal cavity and the skull base bone. Dosimetric analysis showed 9 cases of in-field failure, 4 cases of marginal failure, and 2 cases of out-field failure. For the 6 cases of marginal and out-field failure, the main reasons of recurrence were low dose area in target volume due to not strictly following the guidelines of defining field limit, or inappropriately estimating the involved regions of lesions. CONCLUSION(S): Irradiated area of lateral faciocervical field and lateral facial field employed conventionally in radiotherapy of NPC is rational.",Excluded
2892,"Latent and lytic Epstein-Barr virus gene expression in the peripheral blood of astronauts. Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) latent and replicative gene transcription was analyzed in peripheral blood B-lymphocytes from astronauts who flew on short-duration (~11 days) Shuttle missions and long-duration (~180 days) International Space Station (ISS) missions. Latent, immediate-early, and early gene replicative viral transcripts were detected in samples from six astronauts who flew on short-duration Shuttle missions, whereas viral gene transcription was mostly absent in samples from 24 healthy donors. Samples from six astronauts who flew on long-duration ISS missions were characterized by expanded expression of latent, immediate-early, and early gene transcripts and new onset expression of late replicative transcription upon return to Earth. These data indicate that EBV-infected cells are no longer expressing the restricted set of viral genes that characterize latency but are expressing latent and lytic gene transcripts. These data also suggest the possibility of EBV-related complications in future long-duration missions, in particular interplanetary travel. © 2011 Wiley-Liss, Inc.",Excluded
1966,"Point-of-care ultrasound for confirmation of gastrostomy tube replacement in the pediatric emergency department. Gastrostomy tubes (G-tubes) are frequently used in children for feeding and nutrition. Complications related to G-tubes (and G-buttons) in children represent a common presentation to the emergency department (ED). G-tube replacement is usually performed by pediatric emergency medicine physicians. Misplacement may lead to tract disruption, perforation, fistula tract formation, or feeding into the peritoneum. Contrast-enhanced radiographs are traditionally used for confirmation. In addition to a longer length-of-stay, repeat ED visits result in repeated radiation exposure. The use of point-of-care ultrasound (POCUS) instead of radiography avoids this exposure to ionizing radiation. Here, we describe three patients who presented with G-tube complications in whom POCUS alone performed by pediatricians was used for confirmation of the tubes' replacement. Two children presented to the ED with G-tube dislodgement, and one child presented with a ruptured balloon. In all three cases, a new G-tube was replaced at the bedside using POCUS guidance without the need for further radiographic studies. There were no known ED or clinic returns for G-tube complaints over the next 30 days. This is the first report of pediatricians using POCUS to guide and confirm G-tube replacement in children. The success of these cases suggests the technique's feasibility. Future prospective studies are needed to evaluate the learning curves, diagnostic accuracy, ED length-of-stay, and use of confirmatory imaging.",Excluded

2277,"Cancers after renal transplantation in Tunisia: Multicenter experience. Introduction: Renal transplant recipients are at higher risk of certain tumors such as lymphomas and skin cancers than the general and dialysis populations. Method(s): We retrospectively studied the prevalence of tumors in adult renal transplant recipients in five Tunisian centers of transplantation in Tunis, Monastir, sousse and Sfax from January 1986 to January 2008. Result(s): The study included 52 patients; 32 men and 20 women with a mean age of 36 years (range from 18-54 years). The mean time since dialysis to transplantation was 46 months (20-236 months). Induction therapy was based on thymoglobulin in 100 % and administered in a mean course of 12.4 days in 82,2 % of the patients. Maintenance therapy was based on calcineurin inhibitors (CNI) in 91,2 % of cases, on antimetabolites and corticosteroids in 100 % of cases. Acute rejection occurred in 36 of these cases and was treated with polyclonal or monoclonal antibodies on 40 % of cases. Incidence of cancer among our population was 6,6 % and occurred after a mean period of 55,4 months of transplantation for solid tumors and 99 months for skin tumors. Eighty three percent of the tumors were solid, and the rest were in the skin. Kaposi sarcoma formed 58.6 % and non-Hodgkin or Hodgkin lymphoma 21.7 % of the solid tumors, while spinocellular carcinoma formed 83% and basocellular carcinoma 17% of the skin tumors. Switching CNI to sirolimus in 8.3% cases was associated with a favorable outcome. Mortality was the outcome in 28.3% of the patients with cancer, while partial or complete regression of cancers was observed in 54.7% cases after decreasing the doses of the immunosuppressive medications. Conclusion(s): We conclude that post renal transplant cancer is mainly characterized by the predominance of Kaposi sarcoma favored by solar exposure and excessive Induction and maintenance immunosuppression. Careful follow-up may results in early intervention and decrease mortality.",Excluded
1037,"Patterns of relapse in patients with high grade glioma receiving combined treatments including stereotactic re-irradiation for a first relapse. Purpose Bevacizumab and stereotactic treatment are efficient combined or alone in relapse glioma. However, patterns of relapse after this kind of salvage treatment have never been studied. The purpose of this unicentric retrospective analysis was to assess and understand the patterns of relapse of high grade glioma treated with stereotactic radiation, with or without bevacizumab. Patients and methods Twenty patients with high grade glioma relapse received a stereotactic radiation; among them two patients received temozolomide and eight patients received bevacizumab; among the latter, four received also irinotecan. We matched the stereotactic radiation treatment planning scan with the images of the first treatment and of the second relapse in order to determine the patterns of failure and associate dosimetric profile. Results For the total population, median follow-up from the first diagnosis and relapse were 46.1 and 17.6 months, respectively. Among the 13 patients who relapsed, ten did not receive chemotherapy and three received it (P < 0.05), two received temozolomide and one bevacizumab. Patients who received bevacizumab had no ""out-of-field"" recurrences. Among the 32 irradiated relapses, 15 were ""in-field"" recurrences; among them two were treated with bevacizumab and 13 were not (P < 0.05). For the 32 lesions, a favourable prognostic factor of control was the association of a high-dose of irradiation and the use of bevacizumab. Conclusion For patients with relapsed high grade glioma, local control was higher with combined bevacizumab and high-dose stereotactic radiation.Copyright © 2016",Excluded
2433,"Outcomes of Trimodal Therapy for cT2-3 Urothelial Carcinoma in a Racially Diverse Population: A Single Institution Experience in the Bronx. BACKGROUND: Radical cystectomy (RC) is the historical 'gold standard' treatment for cT2-3 urothelial carcinoma (UC). However, recent evidence supports comparable outcomes of bladder preserving trimodal therapy (TMT) to RC in select patients. OBJECTIVE(S): To assess the oncologic outcomes of our institutional TMT experience. METHOD(S): We retrospectively identified all patients that received radiation therapy (RT) for cT2-3 UC from 2012 to 2018. Clinicopathologic data was then extracted from the patients' medical records. We included patients who underwent RT with or without concurrent chemotherapy for curative intent after diagnostic TURBT, with or without re-staging TURBT. Patient clinical (age, sex, race) and pathologic/disease characteristics of bladder cancer (stage, presence of hydronephrosis, concurrent carcinoma in-situ) were collected. Primary outcomes were: response to TMT (complete response [CR], partial response [PR], progression), recurrence-free, and overall survival. We also analyzed rates of salvage cystectomy and associated disease-specific outcomes. Response was based on the first surveillance imaging, cystoscopy, or TURBT after completion of TMT. RESULT(S): 24 patients underwent TMT during the study period. 29.2% of patients were black/non-hispanic, 37.5% were latino/hispanic, and 20.8% were white/non-hispanic. 58.3% of patients were female. 19 (79.2%), 3 (12.5%), and 2 (8.3%) patients experienced CR, PR and progression after TMT, respectively. At a median follow-up of 22.4 months, 19 (79.2%) patients were recurrence-free, 3 were alive with disease (12.5%), and 2 expired from other causes (8.3%; 1 with and 1 without disease present). Overall, 22 (92.7%) patients were still alive at last follow-up. No clinical variables were significant predictors of CR to TMT. CONCLUSION(S): In concordance with prior reports, TMT offers excellent tumor response rates for patients seeking definitive therapy for cT2-3 UC. Extended follow-up is needed to assess the durability of response and long-term survival after TMT.Copyright © 2020 - IOS Press and the authors. All rights reserved.",Excluded

1090,"Efficacy and safety of intensity-modulated radiotherapy following transarterial chemoembolization in patients with unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma. Three-dimensional conformal radiotherapy in combination with transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) has been beneficial in patients with unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). There have been few clinical reports on the use of intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) in combination with TACE for these patients. The purpose of this study was to assess the efficacy and toxicity of IMRT following TACE in unresectable HCC. The medical records of consecutive patients with unresectable HCC, who underwent IMRT following TACE from January 2009 to June 2014, were retrospectively reviewed in order to assess the overall survival (OS), progression-free survival (PFS), tumor response, and treatment-associated toxicity. A total of 64 lesions in 54 patients were included in the analysis. IMRT was delivered at a median dose of 50 Gy (range 44-70 Gy) at 1.8 to 2.0 Gy per fraction. The overall response rate was achieved in 64.8% of patients with complete response in 20.4% of patients at 3 months after completion of IMRT. The median OS was 20.2 months (95% CI=8.6-31.9), and the actuarial 1-, 2-, and 3-year OS rates were 84.6%, 49.7%, and 36.7%, respectively. The median PFS was 10.5 months (95% CI=7.3-13.7) and the 1-, 2-, and 3-year PFS rates were 44.2%, 23.4%, and 14.6%, respectively. The responders had a significantly higher OS rate than the nonresponders (3-year OS 48.0% vs 14.4%, P=0.001). During and the first month following IMRT, 10 (18.5%) patients developed grade 3 hematological toxicity, and 3 (5.6%) developed grade 3 hepatic toxicity. No patient experienced grade 4 or 5 toxicity. Radiation-induced liver disease was not observed.

3586,"INTESTINE MICROBIOME ASPIRATION (IMBA) CAPSULE: A NEW AUTONOMOUS AND MINIMALLY-INVASIVE DEVICE FOR WHOLE GUT MICROBIOME SAMPLING AND MAPPING. BACKGROUND. Intestinal microbiota is closely related to human health. However, our current understandings about intestine microbiota are limited due to its inaccessibility. Invasive and expensive catheter-based sampling methods are not suitable for large-scale studies. So, a reliable, inexpensive and convenient capsule device to collect intestinal microbiome is demanded. Here, we report the Intestine Microbiome Aspiration (IMBA) which aims to collect intestine fluid sample autonomously. Without using expensive MEMS technologies, IMBA utilizes controlled-release technology equipped with an novel sampling mechanism to achieve precise and regional sampling in intestine. METHODS. Three healthy volunteers and three IBS-D volunteers ingested the IMBA capsule with distilled water in their empty stomach in the morning. As shown in Fig. 1, Each capsule has an outer hard gelatin shell with an small intestine (SI)-targeted coating (Eudragit L100-55) that kept the main capsule body intact in the acidic stomach. Once the outer shell dissolved in SI, the capsule body was exposed to the luminal environment, and intestinal fluid flowed into a compartment via four wide channels on the capsule wall. The compartment contained 50mg hydrophilic fibers to wick and retain the fluidic luminal sample. A piston was fixed by a dissolvable spring-loaded latch to keep the channels open initially. The latch gradually dissolved in its thickness until its structure collapsed to release the spring, which pushed the piston to close the channels and seal the samples. The subjects underwent a low-dose X-ray scan every 30 minutes after oral intake of the capsule to monitor the sampling status until the spring was released. Capsules and swabbed fecal samples were collected by the volunteer after their bowel movements in the following 1-2 days, and sent for 16s rRNA analysis. RESULTS. All six capsules completed sampling in the small intestine within 3 hours after oral intake. Each capsule collected 74mg of small intestine luminal contents on average. The microbiota composition was different not only between intestines and feces, but also between healthy volunteers and IBS-D volunteers. Intestinal samples were characterized by increased abundance of Gammaproteobacteria, Pseudomonadales and Proteobacteria and reduction of Peptostreptococcaceae and Janthinobacterium (Fig. 2). CONCLUSION. The IMBA prototype has proven the concept of ""MEMS-free"" intestine-targeted microbiome sampling technology, a critical step towards personalized whole gut microbiota mapping. The technology offers a safe and reliable solution of capsule-based GI contents sampling while significantly reducing the costs per operation. New designs of large-scale human studies become possible to reveal temporal and spatial variation of gut microbiota for better understanding of its roles in various diseases.

599,"Plasminogen is a master regulator and a potential drug candidate for the healing of radiation wounds. Around 95% of cancer patients undergoing radiotherapy experience cutaneous side effects, and some develop radiation wounds or fibrosis. Currently, there is no effective treatment for these indications. We show here that plasminogen administration enhanced the healing of radiation wounds via pleiotropic effects on gene expression. Using RNA sequencing, we found that plasminogen downregulated the expression of genes in the TLR, TNF, WNT, MAPK, and TGF-beta signaling pathways, and enhanced the anti-inflammatory effect of arachidonic acid, leading to significantly decreased inflammation and improved remodeling of granulation tissue compared with placebo treatment. In addition, plasminogen induced metabolic changes, including decreased glycolysis. Importantly, many of the factors downregulated by plasminogen are pro-fibrotic. Therefore, in radiation wounds with excessive inflammation, plasminogen is able to enhance and redirect the healing process, such that it more closely resembles physiological healing with significantly reduced risk for developing fibrosis. This makes plasminogen an attractive drug candidate for the treatment of radiation wounds in cancer patients.Copyright © 2020, The Author(s).",Excluded

479,"Exercise in space: human skeletal muscle after 6 months aboard the International Space Station. The aim of this investigation was to document the exercise program used by crewmembers (n = 9; 45 +/- 2 yr) while aboard the International Space Station (ISS) for 6 mo and examine its effectiveness for preserving calf muscle characteristics. Before and after spaceflight, we assessed calf muscle volume (MRI), static and dynamic calf muscle performance, and muscle fiber types (gastrocnemius and soleus). While on the ISS, crewmembers had access to a running treadmill, cycle ergometer, and resistance exercise device. The exercise regimen varied among the crewmembers with aerobic exercise performed approximately 5 h/wk at a moderate intensity and resistance exercise performed 3-6 days/wk incorporating multiple lower leg exercises. Calf muscle volume decreased (P < 0.05) 13 +/- 2% with greater (P < 0.05) atrophy of the soleus (-15 +/- 2%) compared with the gastrocnemius (-10 +/- 2%). Peak power was 32% lower (P < 0.05) after spaceflight. Force-velocity characteristics were reduced (P < 0.05) -20 to -29% across the velocity spectrum. There was a 12-17% shift in myosin heavy chain (MHC) phenotype of the gastrocnemius and soleus with a decrease (P < 0.05) in MHC I fibers and a redistribution among the faster phenotypes. These data show a reduction in calf muscle mass and performance along with a slow-to-fast fiber type transition in the gastrocnemius and soleus muscles, which are all qualities associated with unloading in humans. Future long-duration space missions should modify the current ISS exercise prescription and/or hardware to better preserve human skeletal muscle mass and function, thereby reducing the risk imposed to crewmembers.",Excluded

Background Dual axis rotational coronary angiography (DARCA) reduces radiation exposure during coronary angiography on older x-ray systems. The purpose of the current study is to quantify patient and staff radiation exposure using DARCA on a modality already equipped with dose-reducing technology. Additionally, we assessed applicability of 1 dose area product to effective dose conversion factor for both DARCA and conventional coronary angiography (CCA) procedures. Methods and Results Twenty patients were examined using DARCA and were compared with 20 age-, sex-, and body mass index-matched patients selected from a prior study using CCA on the same x-ray modality. All irradiation events are simulated using PCXMC (STUK, Finland) to determine organ and effective doses. Moreover, for DARCA each frame is simulated. Staff dose is measured using active personal dosimeters (DoseAware, Philips Healthcare, The Netherlands). With DARCA, median cumulative dose area product is reduced by 57% (ie, 7.41 versus 17.19 Gy.cm2). Effective dose conversion factors of CCA and DARCA are slightly different, yet this difference is not statistically significant. The occupational dose at physician's chest, leg, and collar level are reduced by 60%, 56%, and 16%, respectively, of which the first 2 reached statistical significance. Median effective dose is reduced from 4.75 mSv in CCA to 2.22 mSv in DARCA procedures, where the latter is further reduced to 1.79 mSv when excluding ventriculography. Conclusions During invasive coronary angiography, DARCA reduces radiation exposure even further toward low-dose values on a system already equipped with advanced image processing and noise reduction algorithms. For both DARCA and CCA procedures, using 1 effective dose conversion factor of 0.30 mSv.Gy-1.cm-2 is feasible.",Excluded
2692,"Lower body negative pressure counters posture induced increases of intraocular pressure and intracranial pressure. Purpose: Recent ophthalmic evaluations of seven astronauts after six-month missions to International Space Station show unexpected vision impairment. In addition, lumbar punctures in four astronauts with optic disc edema showed moderate elevations of cerebral spinal fluid pressure after returning to Earth. This Visual Impairment Intracranial Pressure (VIIP) syndrome is likely related to a headward body fluid shift that elevates intracranial pressure (ICP). We hypothesized that a moderate level of lower body negative pressure (LBNP) would counteract head down, body-tilt, induced elevations in IOP and ICP. Method(s): Twenty-five normal healthy non-smoking volunteers participated in this study (mean age: 31 years). Right and left IOP, ICP (non-invasive ultrasound pulsed phase locked loop), arm blood pressure, and heart rate were measured during the last minute of each testing condition. Subjects were positioned supine (5 mins), sitting (5 mins), 15-degrees head-down tilt (HDT) (5 mins) and ten minutes of HDT with LBNP (25 mmHg). The order of HDT and HDT+LBNP tests were balanced. The right and left IOP values were averaged and used for statistical analysis (significance accepted at p<0.05). Data are presented as mean +/- standard deviation. The change from supine was calculated for IOP values. Result(s): IOP significantly decreased from supine to sitting posture by 3.2 +/- 1.4 mmHg, and increased by 0.9 +/- 1.3 mmHg from supine to the HDT position. LBNP during head-down-tilt significantly lowered IOP to supine levels (difference from supine, 0.3 +/- 1.1 mmHg). In addition, added LBNP during HDT significantly decreased ICP-related pulse amplitudes of transcranial ultrasound waveforms by 2.1+/-3.4 microns (n=9). Mean blood pressure and heart rate did not change significantly across all conditions. Conclusion(s): These data demonstrate that short duration exposures to HDT increase IOP and ICP significantly and further, that LBNP counteracts these elevations of IOP and ICP. Therefore, spaceflight countermeasures that shift fluid to lower body may mitigate vision problems.",Excluded

Investigate whether percutaneous spinal cord stimulator (SCS) leads migrate significantly during a 3-day trial, and determine whether the skin anchoring method influences lead migration. Material and Methods. Twenty patients were prospectively enrolled. Ten leads were anchored with suture and tape and 10 were anchored with tape only. A standardized X-ray protocol of lead position was obtained immediately following lead placement and upon completion of the trial. Results. Using a standardized method, SCS leads were measured and movement was calculated. The average movement for leads anchored with tape only was 8.72mm (SD=5.77), inferiorly; while movement for leads anchored with suture and tape was 24.49mm (SD=11.3), inferiorly. A t-test revealed a significant difference between the groups (t=3.9, P=0.001). Conclusions. Percutaneous SCS trial electrodes migrate significantly, inferiorly, during a 3-day trial. Anchoring the trial electrodes to the skin with a suture and tape results in significantly greater inferior migration when compared with anchoring the lead with tape only.

1832,"Lymphocyte transformation to phytohaemagglutinin and delayed hypersensitivity related to age and previous cancer history. Declining immunosurveillance in old age has been considered one possible explanation for the increased incidence of cancer in the elderly. This study was set up to search for evidence of persistent immunodeficiency in patients with a past history of cancer. Lymphocyte responses to phytohaemagglutinin and cutaneous delayed hypersensivity were assessed in fifty-seven elderly subjects who had successfully completed treatment for cancer more than 18 months previously and compared with those of forty-three healthy controls matched for age and sex. Although a significant difference between mean tritiated thymidine uptake was observed in the lymphocyte response to phytohaemagglutinin (cancer patients 1859 cpm, control 2502 cpm), this could be explained by an unexpectedly prolonged effect of radiotherapy. Mean counts for those twenty-six cancer patients receiving radiotherapy within the period 18 months to 4 years were low (1257 cpm), but were normal (2366 cpm) for the remainder. A significant negative correlation of lymphocyte transformation with age was confirmed in both groups. There was no significant difference in cutaneous delayed hypersensitivity response to commonly encountered antigens. Whilst recognising that these tests do not comprehensively assess immune function, the present results provide no support for the theory that an age-related decline in immune function contributes to the heightened incidence of cancer in the elderly.",Excluded

The correlation between CT findings and patient characteristics was evaluated., RESULTS: Radiographic injury in periods 1 and 2 was: (1) diffuse consolidation 3 and 27%, (2) patchy consolidation and ground-glass opacity (GGO) 13.2 and 33%, (3) diffuse GGO 13.2 and 21%, (4) patchy GGO 16.2 and 6%, and (5) no findings 54.4 and 21%, respectively. Late injury in periods 3 and 4 were: (1) modified conventional pattern (consolidation, volume loss, bronchiectasis) 54 and 44%, (2) mass-like 20 and 28%, (3) scar-like 14 and 16% and (4) no findings 20 and 12%, respectively. The proportion of emphysema grades 2-4 was significantly higher in patients who had no radiological findings 6 weeks after treatment (p=0.021). Both patchy consolidation and GGO patterns resulted more frequently in patients who were not administered steroids (p=0.035). No relationship was found with smoking, tumor dimension and radiation dose., CONCLUSIONS: The majority of patients had no evidence of radiographic lung injury 6 weeks after SBRT; the most prevalent findings were diffuse or patchy GGO. Patchy and diffuse consolidation develops 2-6 months after SBRT. Modified conventional pattern was the most prevalent in the late periods. Copyright 2009 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

2180,"Evaluation of coronary artery image quality with knowledge-based iterative model reconstruction. RATIONALE AND OBJECTIVES: To evaluate knowledge-based iterative model reconstruction (IMR) to improve image quality and reduce radiation dose in coronary computed tomography angiography (cCTA)., MATERIALS AND METHODS: We evaluated 45 consecutive cCTA studies, including 25 studies performed with an 80% systolic dose reduction using tube current modulation (TCM). Each study was reconstructed with filtered back projection (FBP), hybrid iterative reconstruction (iDose(4)), and IMR in a diastolic phase. Additional systolic phase reconstructions were obtained for TCM studies. Mean pixel attenuation value and standard deviation (SD) were measured in the left ventricle and left main coronary artery. Subjective scores were obtained by two independent reviewers on a 5-point scale for definitions of contours of small coronary arteries (<3 mm), coronary calcifications, noncalcified plaque, and overall diagnostic confidence for the presence/absence of stenosis., RESULTS: There was no significant difference in pixel intensity among FBP, iDose(4), and IMR (P > .8). For diastolic phase images, noise amplitude in the left main coronary artery was reduced by a factor of 1.3 from FBP to iDose(4) (SD = 99 vs. 74; P = .005) and by a factor of 2.6 from iDose(4) to IMR (SD = 74 vs. 28; P < .001). For systolic phase TCM images, noise amplitude in the left main coronary artery was reduced by a factor of 2.3 from FBP to iDose(4) (SD = 322 vs. 142; P < .001) and by a factor of 3.0 from iDose(4) to IMR (SD = 142 vs. 48; P < .001). All four subjective image quality scores were significantly better with IMR compared to iDose(4) and FBP (P < .001). The reduction in image noise amplitude and improvement in image quality scores were greatest among obese patients., CONCLUSIONS: IMR reduces intravascular noise on cCTA by 86%-88% compared to FBP, and improves image quality at radiation exposure levels 80% below our standard technique.

1089,"Diagnostic medical imaging radiation exposure and risk of development of solid and hematologic malignancy. Limiting patients' exposure to ionizing radiation during diagnostic imaging is of concern to patients and clinicians. Large single-dose exposures and cumulative exposures to ionizing radiation have been associated with solid tumors and hematologic malignancy. Although these associations have been a driving force in minimizing patients' exposure, significant risks are found when diagnoses are missed and subsequent treatment is withheld. Therefore, based on epidemiologic data obtained after nuclear and occupational exposures, dose exposure limits have been estimated. A recent collaborative effort between the US Food and Drug Administration and the American College of Radiology has provided information and tools that patients and imaging professionals can use to avoid unnecessary ionizing radiation scans and ensure use of the lowest feasible radiation dose necessary for studies. Further collaboration, research, and development should focus on producing technological advances that minimize individual study exposures and duplicate studies. This article outlines the research used to govern safe radiation doses, defines recent initiatives in decreasing radiation exposure, and provides orthopedic surgeons with techniques that may help decrease radiation exposure in their daily practice.

2826,"Knee medial and lateral contact forces in a musculoskeletal model with subject-specific contact point trajectories. Contact point (CP) trajectory is a crucial parameter in estimating medial/lateral tibio-femoral contact forces from the musculoskeletal (MSK) models. The objective of the present study was to develop a method to incorporate the subject-specific CP trajectories into the MSK model. Ten healthy subjects performed 45 s treadmill gait trials. The subject-specific CP trajectories were constructed on the tibia and femur as a function of extension-flexion using low-dose bi-plane X-ray images during a quasi-static squat. At each extension-flexion position, the tibia and femur CPs were superimposed in the three directions on the medial side, and in the anterior-posterior and proximal-distal directions on the lateral side to form the five kinematic constraints of the knee joint. The Lagrange multipliers associated to these constraints directly yielded the medial/lateral contact forces. The results from the personalized CP trajectory model were compared against the linear CP trajectory and sphere-on-plane CP trajectory models which were adapted from the commonly used MSK models. Changing the CP trajectory had a remarkable impact on the knee kinematics and changed the medial and lateral contact forces by 1.03 BW and 0.65 BW respectively, in certain subjects. The direction and magnitude of the medial/lateral contact force were highly variable among the subjects and the medial-lateral shift of the CPs alone could not determine the increase/decrease pattern of the contact forces. The suggested kinematic constraints are adaptable to the CP trajectories derived from a variety of joint models and those experimentally measured from the 3D imaging techniques.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Ltd",Excluded
1688,"A decade of atrial fibrillation ablation shifts in patient characteristics and procedural outcomes. Background Over the past decade, radiofrequency catheter ablation (RFCA) of atrial fibrillation (AF) has evolved into a frequently performed procedure. The aim of this study was to monitor changes in patient characteristics, procedural characteristics, outcomes and complications over the past 10 years. Methods All consecutive patients who underwent primary RFCA treatment of AF in the University Medical Center Utrecht from 2005-2015 were included. In all patients, the primary ablation strategy was pulmonary vein (PV) antrum isolation without additional substrate modification. Baseline patient and procedure characteristics, and 1-year follow-up data of 975 patients were prospectively collected. Results In 2005, 73.4% of patients suffered from paroxysmal AF, which decreased to 45.3% in 2014. Mean age increased from 54 +/- 9 to 61 +/- 10 years and CHA2DS2-VASc score >=2 from 18 to 40.6%. History of AF decreased significantly from 7 to 4 years. Mean procedure duration was 237 +/- 53 min in 2005 and 163 +/- 41 min in 2014. Fluoroscopy time significantly decreased from 41 +/- 17 to 19 +/- 8 min and total radiation exposure from 465 (263-687) to 210 (118-376) mGy. One-year success remained similar (2005: 55.6%, 2014: 54.8%), as did the amount of PV reconnection observed during redo procedures. Due to a marked reduction in vascular complications and moderate PV stenosis, the total complication rate decreased significantly. Conclusion Over the past decade, AF ablation has increasingly been performed in older patients with persistent AF and more comorbidity. Moreover, it has been performed earlier after AF diagnosis. Although several performance parameters, such as procedure duration and complication rate, improved, 1-year single procedure success remained unchanged.Copyright © The Author(s) 2017.",Excluded
834,"The effect of chemotherapy on the latency interval of radiation induced sarcomas. Aim: Radiation induced sarcoma typically manifests 10-20 years after initial radiation exposure. Contemporary cancer treatment often includes a combination of radiation therapy with chemotherapy. This may influence the pattern of second cancer in long term survivors. We performed an audit of radiation induced sarcoma seen in the Bone and Soft Tissue Sarcoma Clinic at Royal Prince Alfred Hospital. Method(s): Patients were identified through the Bone and Soft Tissue Sarcoma Clinic at Royal Prince Alfred Hospital. Patients with a sarcoma diagnosis between June 2005 and June 2010 were identified. Fourteen patients were identified to have radiation induced sarcoma. Result(s): Seven of the patients were female and seven were male. The median age was 54. Of the initial diagnoses, four were sarcoma, five adenocarcinoma. two squamous cell carcinoma, one ependymoma, one melanoma and one lymphoma. The median radiation dose was 50Gy. Five patients received chemotherapy at the time of the initial radiotherapy. The median latency interval for patients who received chemotherapy was 5.1 years, and mean latency interval 5 years. Patients who did not receive chemotherapy had a longer median latency interval of 13.6 years and significantly longer mean latency interval of 13.5 years (p = 0.02). Conclusion(s): We hypothesise that chemotherapy shortens the latency interval of radiation induced sarcomas. This could possibly be through the synergistic effect of chemoradiation on genomic instability in normal cells. To confirm these findings, a large scale multicenter study is required.",Excluded
2648,"Effect of topical morphine (mouthwash) on oral pain due to chemotherapy- and/or radiotherapy-induced mucositis: a randomized double-blinded study. PURPOSE: The objective of the study was to determine if mouthwashes with a morphine-containing solution decrease oral pain associated with radiotherapy- and/or chemotherapy-induced oral mucositis (OM). METHOD(S): Randomized double-blinded crossover study to evaluate the effect of topical oral application of 2 per thousand morphine solution in patients suffering from radiotherapy- and/or chemotherapy-induced OM. Participants assigned to either the morphine solution or a placebo mouthwash received one of the solutions days 1-3 and were then switched over to the other treatment for days 4-6. RESULT(S): Nine patients were randomized in both groups. All patients (mean age, 55.1 +/- 3.0) except one had head and neck cancers. Mean intensity of pain associated with mucosal injury (World Health Organization [WHO] mucositis > or =2) was on a 10-point visual analogue scale: 6.0 +/- 2.7). The analysis of variance (ANOVA) model that included morphine or placebo, day and time of mouthwash, and mouthwash effect shows that pain alleviation 1 hour after mouthwash was significantly influenced by the gesture of the mouthwash (p < 0.001 with either morphine or placebo) and almost by the efficiency of morphine (p = 0.020). Duration of pain relief was 123.7 (standard deviation [SD] +/- 98.2) minutes for morphine. Most other reported symptoms were present at the baseline and were probably associated with the main disease and not secondary to the morphine mouthwash. CONCLUSION(S): Our results suggest a possible analgesic effect of topical morphine in line with previous studies. However, more efforts must be made for the adjustment of systemic analgesics and the development of new alternatives to treat locally OM-associated pain.",Excluded
2522,"Survival outcomes and patterns of failure after D2 dissection and adjuvant chemoradiotherapy for locally advanced gastric cancer: A retrospective study. objective: The goal of the study was to analyze the incidence and patterns of failure in patients with gastric cancer who received D2 dissection and adjuvant chemoradiotherapy (CRT). Method(s): From January 2004 to October 2015, 324 patients with gastric cancer who underwent radical D2 resection followed by postoperative CRT were enrolled. Clinicopathological characteristics and patterns of failure were retrospectively reviewed to identify factors associated with survival and recurrence. Result(s): After a median follow-up of 30 months, the 3-year overall survival and 3-year disease-free survival rates of these patients were 60.3 and 51.1%, respectively. 117 patients had recurrence or metastasis, with peritoneal recurrence as the most frequent (20.7%), followed by distant metastasis (14.2%). The most commonly involved distant organs were the liver (5.9%) and bone (4.9%). Locoregional failure occurred in 39 patients (12.0%), with isolated regional failure occurring in only 23 (7.1%). Further multivariate Cox regression analysis revealed N stage to be an independent risk factor for distant failure-free survival (p = 0.012). Independent risk factors for peritoneal metastasis were tumor differentiation (p = 0.022), T stage (p =0.035) and vascular invasion (p = 0.016). conclusion: Postoperative CRT has a potential effect on optimizing locoregional control, resulting in only 12.0% of locoregional failure. In patients after D2 resection and adjuvant CRT, peritoneal metastasis was the leading pattern of failure, followed by distant metastasis.Copyright © 2018 British Institute of Radiology.

123,"Solitary pulmonary nodule: Characterization with combined wash-in and washout features at dynamic multi-detector row CT. PURPOSE: To prospectively assess the accuracy of combined wash-in and washout characteristics at dynamic contrast material-enhanced multi-detector row computed tomography (CT) in distinguishing benign from malignant solitary pulmonary nodules. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Institutional review board approval and informed consent were obtained. The study included 107 patients (62 men, 45 women; mean age, 55 years; range, 22-81 years) with a solitary pulmonary nodule. After unenhanced CT (2.5-mm collimation) scans were obtained, dynamic CT was performed by using a helical technique (series of images obtained throughout the nodule, with 2.5-mm collimation, at 30, 60, 90, and 120 seconds and 4, 5, 9, 12, and 15 minutes) after intravenous injection of contrast medium (120 mL). Tissue diagnosis was made in 70 nodules, and follow-up images showed benignancy in the remaining 37 (no change in size, n = 32; decrease in size, n = 5). CT findings were analyzed in terms of wash-in and washout of contrast medium. Sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy for malignant nodules were calculated by considering both the wash-in and washout characteristics at dynamic CT. RESULT(S): There were 49 malignant and 58 benign nodules. When diagnostic criteria for malignancy of both wash-in of 25 HU or greater and washout of 5-31 HU were applied, sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy for malignancy were 94% (46 of 49 nodules), 90% (52 of 58 nodules), and 92% (98 of 107 nodules), respectively. Of 58 benign nodules, 27 showed less than 25 HU wash-in, 14 showed persistent contrast enhancement without washout and with wash-in of 25 HU or greater, and 11 showed washout greater than 31 HU and wash-in of 25 HU or greater. CONCLUSION(S): Evaluation of solitary pulmonary nodules by analyzing combined wash-in and washout characteristics at dynamic contrast-enhanced multi-detector row CT showed 92% accuracy for distinguishing benign nodules from malignant nodules. © RSNA, 2005.",Excluded
2059,"Effect of thoracic irradiation on hepatocyte growth factor in rats lung and in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid of patients with thoracic malignancies. This study aimed to examine the physiological role of hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) after thoracic irradiation. We analysed the changes of HGF protein levels in rat lung following 12 Gy of whole thoracic irradiation. Bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) was then collected from 11 patients (10 lung cancer and one oesophageal cancer) after completion of radiation therapy. One month after irradiation, the HGF protein level in the lungs of irradiated rats decreased (p<0.05), followed by a remarkable elevation in HGF protein levels 2 (p<0.05) and 3 months (nonsignificant) after irradiation accompanied by the clinical appearance of radiation pneumonitis. Finally, HGF protein levels in the lung returned to their original level 6 months after thoracic irradiation. In humans, HGF protein levels in the BALF in the limited irradiated area were lower than those obtained from unirradiated areas (p<0.05). In conclusion, hepatocyte growth factor production is transiently suppressed in the irradiated area after irradiation.",Excluded

One pair of radiographs was obtained with the digital selenium chest radiography system, and the other with conventional film-screen technique. 9 criteria were rated using a 4 point scale. Technical parameters were standardised. Radiation dose was measured in both techniques and compared., RESULTS: A total of 855 criteria were rated. 740 findings were diagnosed in accordance on both techniques (740/855 = 87%). 115 criteria (115/855 = 13%) showed deviations. The mean radiation dose for the selenium detector was 0.02 cGy and for the conventional system 0.11 cGy., CONCLUSION: The exposure of radiation is lower using a selenium x-ray detector compared to conventional film-screen technique in chest radiography. The digital selenium system performs well in a clinical setting, providing visualisation of pathological findings as good as a standard screen-film system.",Excluded
291,"Effect of early risedronate treatment on bone mineral density and bone turnover markers after liver transplantation: A prospective single-center study. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of risedronate (RIS) on bone loss and bone turnover markers after liver transplantation (LT). Patients with osteopenia or osteoporosis within the first month after LT were randomized to receive RIS 35 mg/week plus calcium 1000 mg/day and vitamin D3 800 IU/day (n = 45) or calcium and vitamin D3 at same dosages (n = 44). Primary endpoint was change in bone mineral density (BMD) 6 and 12 months after LT. Secondary endpoints included changes in serum beta-CrossLaps (beta-CTX) and procollagen type 1 amino-terminal peptide (P1NP) and fracture rate. Spine X-rays were obtained at baseline and after 12 months. There was no significant difference in BMD changes between both treatment groups at any sites; either at 6 or 12 months. Spine BMD increased in both groups at 12 months vs. baseline (P = 0.001). RIS patients had a significant increase in intertrochanteric BMD at 12 months (P < 0.05 vs. baseline). Serum beta-CTX decreased in both groups (P < 0.01), with significant differences between groups at 3 months. No significant difference in vertebral fracture incidence was found. After 12 months, BMD improved at lumbar spine and did not change at hip in both groups. Significant differences between both groups were not found. Other factors (calcium and vitamin D replacement, early prednisone withdrawal) seem to have also positive effects in BMD. © 2011 The Authors Transplant International © 2011 European Society for Organ Transplantation.",Excluded
163,"Altered depression-related behaviors and functional changes in the dorsal raphe nucleus of serotonin transporter-deficient mice. BACKGROUND: As a key regulator of serotonergic activity and target of many antidepressant treatments, the serotonin transporter (SERT) represents a potential mediator of anxiety- and depression-related behaviors. Using mice lacking the SERT (SERT KO), we examined the role of SERT function in anxiety- and depression-related behaviors and serotonergic neuron function., METHODS: Serotonin transporter knockout mice were evaluated in paradigms designed to assess anxiety-, depression-, and stress-related behaviors. Dorsal raphe nucleus (DRN) function was assessed by quantitative serotonergic cell counting and extracellular electrical recording of neuronal firing properties., RESULTS: Serotonin transporter knockout mice showed an increase in latency to feed in a novel situation, more immobility in a forced swim, increased escape latency in a shock escape paradigm, and decreased immobility in tail suspension. No differences in anxiety-related behaviors were seen in the open field and the elevated plus maze. Serotonin transporter knockout mice exhibit a 50% reduction in serotonergic cell number and a fourfold decrease in firing rate in the DRN., CONCLUSIONS: Developmental loss of SERT produces altered behaviors in models of depression that are generally opposite to those produced by antidepressant treatment. The reduced serotonergic cell number and firing rate in the DRN of adult SERT KO mice suggest a mechanism for these altered behaviors.",Excluded
424,"Intracranial germ cell tumors: A singleinstitution experience. BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Intracranial germ cell tumors (GCTs) are not a common disease. We reviewed the experience of a single institution to determine the variables that affect treatment outcome. DESIGN AND SETTING: A retrospective review of patients with the diagnosis of intracranial germ cell tumors treated in a single institution (KFSHRC) during the period from March 1985 to December 2007. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Fifty-seven patients with the diagnosis of intracranial GCT were recorded in the KFSHRC Tumor Registry during the period from 1985 to 2007. Seven patients with a pineal region tumor treated as germinomas in the earlier years without a tissue diagnosis were excluded. This retrospective study was restricted to the remaining 50 patients with a tissue or marker diagnosis: 31 germinomas and 19 non-germinomatous germ cell tumors (NGGCTs). RESULT(S): The 10-year overall survival (OS), event-free survival (EFS) and relapse-free survival (RFS) were 87%, 88% and 96% for patients with germinoma, with a median follow-up of 4.5 (range 2-17) years, compared with 26%, 29% and 46% for patients with NGGCT with a median follow-up of 3 (range 1.5-13) years. For NGGCT, variables favorably influencing OS were younger age (< 16 y vs >=16 y, P=.01), higher radiation dose (>50 Gy vs <=50 Gy; P=.03) and later year of diagnosis (>1990 vs <1990 P=.002). CONCLUSION(S): Tissue diagnosis of GCTs is mandatory prior to treatment except for patients with elevated markers. In germinoma, localized radiotherapy (RT) for M0 patients may be adequate. Long-term follow-up is needed to define the benefit of adding chemotherapy. For NGGCT, the use of combined modality treatment and RT dose >50 Gy are important factors that influence the outcome. Second-look surgery and resection of residual/ refractory tumors is always recommended.",Excluded
967,"Multiple sclerosis, brain radiotherapy, and risk of neurotoxicity: The Mayo Clinic experience. Purpose: The aim of this study was a retrospective assessment of neurotoxicity in patients with multiple sclerosis (MS) receiving external beam radiotherapy (EBRT) to the brain. Methods and Materials: We studied 15 consecutively treated patients with MS who received brain EBRT. Neurologic toxicity was assessed with the Common Toxicity Criteria v.3.0. Result(s): Median follow-up for the 5 living patients was 6.0 years (range, 3.3-27.4 years). No exacerbation of MS occurred in any patient during EBRT. Five patients had Grade 4 neurologic toxicity and 1 had possible Grade 5 toxicity. Kaplan-Meier estimated risk of neurotoxicity greater than Grade 4 at 5 years was 57% (95% confidence interval, 27%-82%). Toxicity occurred at 37.5 to 54.0 Gy at a median of 1.0 year (range, 0.2-4.3 years) after EBRT. Univariate analysis showed an association between opposed-field irradiation of the temporal lobes, central white matter, and brainstem and increased risk of neurotoxicity (p < 0.04). Three of 6 cases of toxicity occurred in patients treated before 1986. Conclusion(s): External beam radiotherapy of the brain in patients with MS may be associated with an increased risk of neurotoxicity compared with patients without demyelinating illnesses. However, this risk is associated with treatment techniques that may not be comparable to modern, conformal radiotherapy. © 2006 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.",Excluded

OBJECTIVE:: To assess the effects of preoperative chemoradiotherapy (CRT) on anastomotic leakage (AL) after rectal cancer resection, using propensity score matching. BACKGROUND:: Conflicting data have emerged over the last decade regarding the effect of preoperative CRT on AL. METHOD(S):: We reviewed 1437 consecutive patients with rectal cancer who underwent low anterior resection (LAR) at our institution between 2005 and 2012. AL evaluated as grade C was the primary endpoint, as proposed by the International Study Group of Rectal Cancer in 2010. The patients were treated with (n = 360) or without (n = 1077) preoperative CRT. The total radiation dose was 50.4 Gy in 28 fractions. Multivariate and propensity score matching analyses were used to compensate for the differences in some baseline characteristics. RESULT(S):: The preoperative CRT group contained more patients with the following characteristics, older age, male sex, smoker, advanced stage tumor, lower/mid rectal tumor location, ultra-LAR, and diverting stoma, than the non-preoperative CRT group (all Ps < 0.05). Postoperative AL occurred in 91 patients (6.3%). Before propensity score matching, the incidence of AL in patients with or without preoperative CRT was 7.5% and 5.9%, respectively (P = 0.293). After propensity score matching, the 2 groups were nearly balanced except for the initial stage and the length of the surgeonE's career, and the incidence of AL in patients with or without preoperative CRT was 7.5% and 8.1%, respectively (P = 0.781).

Iterative reconstruction was used in all patients. For image quality assessment, CTA images were evaluated on a three-point scale and signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR) were calculated and compared. Furthermore, computed tomography (CT) dose index was recorded., RESULTS: Mean CT values and noise levels were higher in group A compared to group B (all P < .001), whereas SNR and CNR were lower than those in group B (all P < .001). Furthermore, the image quality of the aorta at the level of the diaphragm was lower in group A than that in group B (P < .05). However, image quality was graded as diagnostic in all patients, and motion artifacts of the aortic arch were significantly decreased in group A (P <.05). Interreader agreement was good or excellent for image quality assessment (k = 0.625-0.835). The 70-kVp CTA protocol, which allows dose reduction of 85%, was considered diagnostic in all instances by two readers., CONCLUSIONS: Our proposed thoracic aortic CTA protocol provides diagnostic information with substantial reduction of both radiation and contrast agent doses compared to standard-pitch CTA at 100 kVp.

In this study, radiation-induced kidney injury represented by changes of creatinine clearance (Ccr) and renal parenchymal volume measured by computed tomography (CT) were evaluated by analysing dose-volume histograms (DVHs) in patients with primary gastric diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (PGDLBCL) treated with chemoradiotherapy., MATERIALS AND METHODS: Thirty-eight PGDLBCL patients (seventy-six kidneys) treated with chemoradiotherapy were included in this study. At least 4 years of follow-up was required for eligibility. Patients underwent (immuno-) chemotherapy followed by radiotherapy with approximately 40Gy to the whole stomach and perigastric lymph nodes. Ccr and CT were obtained at least annually. Changes of Ccr and renal parenchymal volume before and 4years after radiotherapy were compared using DVH parameters., RESULTS: Mean Ccr decreased significantly from 82.7mL/min (range, 39-124mL/min) before radiotherapy to 70.4mL/min (range, 35-109mL/min) (p=0.01) 4years after radiotherapy. Mean reduction of bilateral renal parenchymal volume was 12% (range, -5-37%) in the same time period. Ccr and renal parenchymal volume tended to lower over time more than 4years after radiotherapy. Concerning DVH analysis, V20Gy26.6% and D30%19Gy had a significant risk of bilateral renal atrophy of 14% and reduction of the Ccr20mL/min., CONCLUSION: This study revealed that there was a definite relationship between DVH, renal atrophy and Ccr reduction. V20Gy<26.6% and D30%<19Gy appeared to be safe dose constraints for a Ccr reduction of <20mL/min 4years after radiotherapy. Copyright © 2016 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.",Excluded
2650,"Intracoronary beta-brachytherapy using a rhenium-188 filled balloon catheter in restenotic lesions of native coronary arteries and venous bypass grafts. Purpose: We have previously demonstrated the efficacy of intracoronary beta-brachytherapy using a liquid 188Re-filled balloon in a randomised trial including de novo lesions. Percutaneous coronary interventions in restenotic lesions and in stenoses of venous bypass grafts are characterised by a high recurrence rate for restenosis and re-interventions. Against this background, we wanted to assess the impact of intracoronary beta-brachytherapy using a liquid 188Re-filled balloon in restenotic lesions in native coronary arteries and venous bypass grafts. Method(s): In 243 patients, beta-brachytherapy with 22.5 Gy was applied at a tissue depth of 0.5 mm. Patients were followed up angiographically after 6 months and clinically for 12 months. The primary clinical endpoint was the incidence of MACE (death, myocardial infarction, target vessel revascularisation). Secondary angiographic endpoints were late loss and binary restenosis rate in the total segment. Result(s): All irradiation procedures were successfully performed. A total of 222 lesions were in native coronary arteries; 21 were bypass lesions. Mean irradiation length was 41.6+/-17.3 mm (range 20-150 mm) in native coronary arteries and 48.1+/-33.9 mm (range 30-180 mm) in bypass lesions; the reference diameter was 2.57+/-0.52 mm and 2.83+/-0.76 mm, respectively. There was no vessel thrombosis during antiplatelet therapy. Angiographic/clinical follow-up rate was 84%/100%. MACE rate was 17.6% in the native coronary artery group and 38.1% in the CABG group (p<0.03). Binary restenosis rate was 22.5% and 55.6% (p<0.01), and late loss was 0.38+/-0.72 mm and 1.33+/-1.11 mm (p<0.001), respectively. Conclusion(s): We conclude that intracoronary beta-brachytherapy with a liquid 188Re-filled balloon using 22.5 Gy at a tissue depth of 0.5 mm in restenotic lesions is safe. It is associated with a low binary restenosis rate, resulting in a low occurrence rate of MACE within 12 months in restenotic lesions in native coronary arteries but not in vein grafts. © 2006 Springer-Verlag.",Excluded
3667,"[Radiological determination of femoral rotation deformity--computerized tomography, optimized measurement accuracy and exposure dosage]. 58 Patients, suspicious to have rotation deformity of the femur, were examined. To compare the value of diagnostic methods in measuring the degree of malrotation we estimated this degree using clinical examination and calculated the anteversion of the femoral neck, taking radiographs in the technique of Dunn and Rippstein, and a modified method of computed tomography. Only in twelve cases the direction of malrotation was corresponding in all three methods, although considerable variations in quantitative results were noted. Maintaining the exact position of the patient, necessary to get reproducible results using conventional X-ray technique, was impossible in most cases of patients with posttraumatic joint-stiffness and malalignment. Determination of femoral neck anteversion using this modified method of CT is a quick, reproducible technique to calculate the degree of malrotation, insensitive to the position of the patient. By means of this CT method it was possible to approach the highest accuracy in precise preoperative planing. Furthermore the radiation exposure could be reduced in a range of 20%-40%.",Excluded
3599,"Towards the control of chikungunya vector in la Reunion using the sterile insect technique: Sexual competitiveness and mating success of sterilized males Aedes albopictus. The sterile insect technique (SIT) is widely used as part of area-wide integrated pest management programs for insects such as fruit fies, screw-worm fies and tsetse fies. It is based on the releases of large numbers of sterile males, which transfer their sterile sperm to wild females for the fertilization of the eggs, resulting in embryonic death. The lack of offspring could then lead to a decrease of the wild population density. The SIT is currently being developed at the FAO/IAEA in Vienna and on La Reunion, France, for the potential control of Aedes albopictus, vector of Chikungunya and secondary vector of Dengue viruses. In this context, we investigated the impact of the sterilisation process on male mating success and sexual competitiveness in the laboratory and under semi-feld conditions. Males from a young laboratory colony (F4) were irradiated as pupae (>20h old) with gamma-rays at 35 or 40 Gy. In the laboratory, the time for male sexual maturation was not affected by the irradiation, neither was the insemination rate of 4 days old males as compared to un-irradiated ones. The daily individual mating success of sterile males during 15 days was reduced as compared to un-irradiated males; however the differences were signifcant only during the second week. Sterility was maintained over successive matings and after a resting period. Under semi-feld conditions, sterile males competed well against wild males, though a resting period of 5 days in the laboratory before release greatly improved their effciency. A ratio of fve sterile to one wild male resulted in a two-fold reduction of the wild females' mean fertility. Valuable information on the effects of the sterilization process was collected and it is suggested that an effcient reduction of a wild population might be achieved by releasing sterile males as adults. Moreover, the results indicate that a resting period allows a recovery from radiation-induced somatic damages which improved the biological quality of the males.",Excluded
940,"Differentiation of salivary gland tumors through tumor heterogeneity: a comparison between pleomorphic adenoma and Warthin tumor using CT texture analysis. Purpose: We compared the diagnostic performance of CT texture analysis in single-phase CT scan with that of conventional enhancement pattern analysis in a two-phase CT scan for discrimination of salivary gland tumors, Warthin tumor (WT) from pleomorphic adenoma (PA). Method(s): One hundred seventy-eight patients with PA and 84 patients with WT were selected and CT texture analysis was separately performed on early (40s) and delayed (180s) phases, after injection of the contrast agent, using commercially available software. The attenuation changes and enhancement patterns were visually and quantitatively assessed with Hounsfield units (HU). Differences between PAs and WTs were analyzed using chi2 test and independent t test. Diagnostic performance of texture parameters in single-phase CT was compared with that of dynamic enhancement pattern in two-phase CT using the McNemar test. Result(s): Ratio of tumoral HU (delayed phase/early phase) was significantly higher in PAs compared with WTs (p < 0.001). Tumor heterogeneity parameters, standard deviation (SD) and entropy, were significantly lower in WTs regardless of the type of filter used (p <= 0.001). Mean with coarse filter (AUC = 0.944) on early phase scan and entropy with medium filter (AUC = 0.901) on delayed scan were best discriminators between PAs and WTs. Diagnostic accuracy of mean (90.5%) on early scan and entropy (84.7%) on delayed scan was not significantly different from the accuracy (89.3%) of conventional wash-out pattern for distinguishing WTs from PAs (p = 0.742, p = 0.088, respectively). Conclusion(s): Diagnostic performance of texture parameters was similar to that of quantitative enhancement pattern for differentiating WTs from PAs, with the advantage in lower radiation exposure.Copyright © 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.",Excluded
1183,Efficacy of radiation therapy for the treatment of macroscopic canine oral soft tissue sarcoma. This retrospective study evaluated the efficacy of radiotherapy used alone in macroscopic oral soft tissue sarcoma. Thirty-one dogs qualified for the study. Twenty dogs received curative radiotherapy (median total dose: 52.5 Gy) and eleven dogs were treated palliatively (3 x 8 Gy or 5 x 6 Gy). The time-to-progression for the curatively-treated dogs was 333 days versus 180 days for the palliatively-treated dogs (p=0.134). The overall survival was 331 days for the curative group and 310 days for the palliative group (p=0.2292).

727,"Outcomes and toxicities of definitive radiotherapy and reirradiation using 3-dimensional conformal or intensity-modulated (pencil beam) proton therapy for patients with nasal cavity and paranasal sinus malignancies. BACKGROUND: Proton therapy (PT) improves outcomes in patients with nasal cavity (NC) and paranasal sinus (PNS) cancers. Herein, the authors have reported to their knowledge the largest series to date using intensity-modulated proton therapy (IMPT) in the treatment of these patients., METHODS: Between 2013 and 2018, a total of 86 consecutive patients (68 of whom were radiation-naive and 18 of whom were reirradiated) received PT to median doses of 70 grays and 67 grays relative biological effectiveness, respectively. Approximately 53% received IMPT., RESULTS: The median follow-up was 23.4 months (range, 1.7-69.3 months) for all patients and 28.1 months (range, 2.3-69.3 months) for surviving patients. The 2-year local control (LC), distant control, disease-free survival, and overall survival rates were 83%, 84%, 74%, and 81%, respectively, for radiation-naive patients and 77%, 80%, 54%, and 66%, respectively for reirradiated patients. Among radiation-naive patients, when compared with 3-dimensional conformal proton technique, IMPT significantly improved LC (91% vs 72%; P < .01) and independently predicted LC (hazard ratio, 0.14; P = .01). Sixteen radiation-naive patients (24%) experienced acute grade 3 toxicities; 4 (6%) experienced late grade 3 toxicities (osteoradionecrosis, vision loss, soft-tissue necrosis, and soft tissue fibrosis) (grading was performed according to the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events [version 5.0]). Slightly inferior LC was noted for patients undergoing reirradiation with higher complications: 11% experienced late grade 3 toxicities (facial pain and brain necrosis). Patients treated with reirradiation had more grade 1 to 2 radionecrosis than radiation-naive patients (brain: 33% vs 7% and osteoradionecrosis: 17% vs 3%)., CONCLUSIONS: PT achieved remarkable LC for patients with nasal cavity and paranasal sinus cancers with lower grade 3 toxicities relative to historical reports. IMPT has the potential to improve the therapeutic ratio in these malignancies and is worthy of further investigation. Copyright © 2020 American Cancer Society.",Excluded

We analyzed the prognoses of patients with meningiomas with a rhabdoid or papillary component compared to those of patients with anaplastic meningiomas. From 1994 to June 2013, 14 anaplastic meningiomas, 6 meningiomas with a rhabdoid component, and 5 meningiomas with papillary component were pathologically diagnosed. We analyzed magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) findings, extent of removal, adjuvant treatment, progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS), and pathologic features of 14 anaplastic meningiomas (group A), 5 meningiomas with a predominant (>=50%) papillary or rhabdoid component (group B1), and 6 meningiomas without a predominant (<50%) rhabdoid or papillary component (group B2). Homogeneous enhancement on MRI was associated with improved PFS compared to heterogeneous enhancement (p=0.025). Depending on pathology, the mean PFS was 134.9+/-31.6 months for group A, 46.6+/-13.4 months for group B1, and 118.7+/-19.2 months for group B2. The mean OS was 138.5+/-24.6 months for group A and 59.7+/-16.8 months for group B1. All recurrent tumors were of the previously diagnosed pathology, except for one tumor from group B1, which recurred as an atypical meningioma without a papillary component. Group B1 tumors showed a more aggressive behavior than group B2 tumors. In group B2 cases, the pathologic findings of non-rhabdoid/papillary portion could be considered for further adjuvant treatment.Copyright © 2016 The Korean Neurosurgical Society.",Excluded

PURPOSE: In some primary immunodeficiency (PID) patients, especially in the subgroup with common variable immunodeficiency (CVID), radiosensitivity is a concern and avoidance of repeated radiation exposure has been recommended. To investigate the use of lung Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) instead of Computed Tomography (CT) for the diagnosis and follow-up of various lesions in the lung parenchyma and airways, especially in PID patients in whom x-ray exposure should be limited., METHODS: The study enrolled 23 patients with PID who underwent thorax CT within the last 3 months and/or who will undergo initial radiological assessment. Lung MRI was performed in all patients to compare the pulmonary findings with CT images., RESULTS: MRI performance was weaker at detecting bronchiectasis extension, and a low concordance was found between MRI and CT in the assessment of the number of bronchial generations. CT better identified peripheral airway abnormalities, while CT and MRI gave similar results for detecting the presence and extension of consolidation, bullae, mucus plugging, bronchial wall thickening, bronchiectasis severity and nodules., CONCLUSIONS: Despite the low spatial resolution, higher cost, and low availability, we suggest MRI as a possible radiation-free alternative to CT in selected patients with PID.",Excluded
3319,"Targeted use of endoscopic CO2 laser cricopharyngeal myotomy for improving swallowing function following head and neck cancer treatment. BACKGROUND: Cricopharyngeal dysfunction following head and neck cancer treatment may lead to a significant reduction in oral intake. Carbon dioxide laser is an established procedure for the treatment of non-malignant cricopharyngeal disorders. We report our experience of laser cricopharyngeal myotomy with objective swallowing outcome measures, before and after treatment., METHODS: We identified 11 patients who had undergone carbon dioxide laser cricopharyngeal myotomy for dysphagia following radiotherapy, with or without chemotheraphy between January 2006 and July 2011. We analysed the swallowing outcomes following carbon dioxide laser cricopharyngeal myotomy by retrospective grading of pre- and post-procedure videofluoroscopic swallowing study of liquids, using the validated Modified Barium Swallow Impairment Profile., RESULTS: The median Modified Barium Swallow Impairment Profile score was 13 pre-myotomy and 10 post-myotomy. This difference between scores was non-significant (p = 0.41). The median, cricopharyngeal-specific Modified Barium Swallow Impairment Profile variables (14 and 17) improved from 3 to 2, but were similarly non-significant (p = 0.16).

1332,"Precise determination of the erythema response of human skin to ultraviolet radiation and quantification of effects of protectors. BACKGROUND: We describe highly reproducible methods for quantifying the erythema response of precisely selected areas (spots) of human skin to graded doses of ultraviolet radiation (UVR). These methods have permitted evaluation of the efficacy of protectors, such as sulforaphane from crucifers, that defend cells through induction of cytoprotective (phase 2) genes., METHODS: Spots on the back were precisely located by opaque, adhesive, vinyl templates provided with 16 circular, 2.0 cm diameter occludable windows. Doses (100-800 mJ/cm(2)) of narrow-band (311 nm) UVR were administered, and the erythema index (a(*)) was measured with a chromometer on treated and control areas, before and after radiation., RESULTS: Daily variations in basal a(*) values of each spot were much smaller than the differences of a(*) values among spots of one individual, or those of corresponding spots among different individuals. The increments in erythema responses to UVR (Delta a(*)) were similar despite large variations of basal a(*) of spots. The most appropriate measure of UVR-evoked erythema is therefore the Delta a(*) value for each spot, which is an independent observational entity. Delta a(*) was proportional to UVR dose, and independent of spot location. To evaluate effectiveness of protectors against UVR damage we paired horizontally adjacent spots for treatment and controls. Vertical or random spot pairing did not provide significantly higher consistency. Protective efficacy against UVR erythema is appropriately expressed as percent reduction in Delta a(*) values upon treatment with inducers., CONCLUSIONS: The protection of skin against UVR damage can be quantified precisely from changes in erythema index (Delta a(*)) obtained with a chromometer.",Excluded
3223,"Feasibility of low radiation dose retrospectively-gated cardiac CT for functional analysis in adult congenital heart disease. BACKGROUND: The use of cardiac computed tomography (CT) in the evaluation of adult congenital heart disease patients is limited due to concerns of high radiation doses. The purpose of this study was to prospectively assess whether low radiation dose cardiac CT is feasible to evaluate ventricular systolic function in adults with congenital heart disease., METHODS: The study group included 30 consecutive patients with significant congenital heart disease who underwent a total of 35 ECG-gated cardiac CT scans utilizing a 320-detector row CT scanner. Each study included a non-contrast scan and subsequent contrast-enhanced retrospectively-gated acquisition. Effective radiation dose was estimated by multiplying the dose length product by a k-factor of 0.014mSv/mGycm., RESULTS: The mean age of the patients was 34.4+/-8.9years, 60% were men, and mean body mass index was 24.2+/-4.3kg/m2. A majority of patients (n=28, 93.3%) had contraindications to cardiac MRI. A tube potential of 80kV was used in 27 (77.1%) of the contrast-enhanced scans. The mean signal-to-noise and contrast-to-noise ratios were 11.5+/-3.9 and 10.3+/-3.7, respectively. The median radiation dose for non-contrast and contrast-enhanced images were 0.1mSv (0.07-0.2mSv) and 0.94mSv (0.5-2.1mSv), respectively. All 35 CT scans were successfully analyzed for ventricular systolic function., CONCLUSIONS: A low radiation contrast-enhanced, retrospectively-gated cardiac CT with a median radiation dose of less than 1mSv was successful in evaluating ventricular systolic function in 30 consecutive adult congenital heart disease patients who underwent a total of 35 scans.

2115,"Interactions between auditory 'what' and 'where' pathways revealed by enhanced near-threshold discrimination of frequency and position. Partially segregated neuronal pathways (""what"" and ""where"" pathways, respectively) are thought to mediate sound recognition and localization. Less studied are interactions between these pathways. In two experiments, we investigated whether near-threshold pitch discrimination sensitivity (d') is altered by supra-threshold task-irrelevant position differences and likewise whether near-threshold position discrimination sensitivity is altered by supra-threshold task-irrelevant pitch differences. Each experiment followed a 2 x 2 within-subjects design regarding changes/no change in the task-relevant and task-irrelevant stimulus dimensions. In Experiment 1, subjects discriminated between 750 Hz and 752 Hz pure tones, and d' for this near-threshold pitch change significantly increased by a factor of 1.09 when accompanied by a task-irrelevant position change of 65 micros interaural time difference (ITD). No response bias was induced by the task-irrelevant position change. In Experiment 2, subjects discriminated between 385 micros and 431 micros ITDs, and d' for this near-threshold position change significantly increased by a factor of 0.73 when accompanied by task-irrelevant pitch changes (6 Hz). In contrast to Experiment 1, task-irrelevant pitch changes induced a response criterion bias toward responding that the two stimuli differed. The collective results are indicative of facilitative interactions between ""what"" and ""where"" pathways. By demonstrating how these pathways may cooperate under impoverished listening conditions, our results bear implications for possible neuro-rehabilitation strategies. We discuss our results in terms of the dual-pathway model of auditory processing.",Excluded

OBJECTIVES: The objectives of this work were to establish the primary clinical determinants of patient radiation dose associated with percutaneous coronary interventional (PCI) and to identify opportunities for dose reduction., BACKGROUND: Use of X-ray imaging and associated radiation dose is a necessary part of PCI. Potential adverse consequences of radiation dose include skin radiation injury and predicted increase in lifetime cancer risk., METHODS: Cumulative skin dose (CSD) (measured in gray [Gy] units) was selected as a measurement of patient radiation burden. Several patient-, disease-, and treatment-related variables, including 15 performing physicians, were analyzed in a multiple linear regression statistical model with cumulative skin dose CSD as the primary end point. The model results provide an estimate of the relative CSD increase (decrease) attributable to each variable., RESULTS: Percutaneous coronary interventions performed on 1,287 male and 540 female patients were included. Median patient age was 68.6 years, median body mass index was 29.7 kg/m(2), and median weight was 88 kg. Median CSD was 1.64 Gy per procedure for male and 1.15 Gy for female patients. Increasing body mass index, patient sex, lesion complexity, lesion location, and performing physician were significantly associated with CSD. Physicians who performed more procedures were associated with lower CSD., CONCLUSIONS: Several primary determinants of patient radiation dose during PCI were identified. Along with physician development of radiation-sparing methods and skills, pre-procedure dose planning is proposed to help minimize radiation dose for PCI.

1357,"Neuromuscular activation patterns during treadmill walking after space flight. Astronauts adopt a variety of neuromuscular control strategies during space flight that are appropriate for locomoting in that unique environment, but are less than optimal upon return to Earth. We report here the first systematic investigation of potential adaptations in neuromuscular activity patterns associated with postflight locomotion. Astronaut-subjects were tasked with walking on a treadmill at 6.4 km/h while fixating a visual target 30 cm away from their eyes after space flights of 8-15 days. Surface electromyography was collected from selected lower limb muscles and normalized with regard to mean amplitude and temporal relation to heel strike. In general, high correlations (more than 0.80) were found between preflight and postflight activation waveforms for each muscle and each subject: however relative activation amplitude around heel strike and toe off was changed as a result of flight. The level of muscle cocontraction and activation variability, and the relationship between the phasic characteristics of the ankle musculature in preparation for toe off also were altered by space flight. Subjects also reported oscillopsia during treadmill walking after flight. These findings indicate that, after space flight, the sensory-motor system can generate neuromuscular-activation strategies that permit treadmill walking, but subtle changes in lower-limb neuromuscular activation are present that may contribute to increased lower limb kinematic variability and oscillopsia also present during postflight walking.",Excluded

Recovery kinetics and recovery capacity were studied in a fast proliferating normal tissue, skin, and in an anaplastic mouse mammary carcinoma, CaNT.

The rate of recovery in tumours (t1/2 = 0.31 +/- 0.15 h for local control) was significantly faster than in skin (t1/2 = 0.96 +/- 0.10 h). By contrast, the fractionation sensitivity of CaNT tumours was less than that of skin (alpha/beta = 43.3 +/- 8.5 Gy vs. alpha/beta = 7.9 +/- 0.2 Gy). Tissues with recovery half-times similar to or longer than that determined for skin would be at risk if interfraction intervals less than 6 h are used in regimes which involve the use of two or more fractions per day. This would be especially true for tissues that show a greater sensitivity to dose fractionation, and hence more sparing of radiation damage with hyperfractionation.",Excluded

PURPOSE/OBJECTIVE(S):: T4 locally advanced squamous cell cancers of the head and neck (SCCHN) with bone and cartilage invasion (BCI) traditionally have been treated with resection followed up with chemoradiotherapy (CRT). Because the organ preservation trials, more patients with BCI, as well as those with soft tissue invasion (STI), have been treated with definitive CRT. This is a review of our experience. MATERIALS/METHODS:: We performed a retrospective review of patients who underwent definitive CRT or radical resection followed up with postoperative CRT for T4N0-3M0 locally advanced SCCHN. We analyzed outcomes based on STI/BCI and types of treatment. Radiotherapy doses ranged from 59.4 to 72 Gy. Concurrent chemotherapy was platinum based in all CRT patients. RESULT(S):: From 1995 to 2006, 101 patients with locally advanced SCCHN were treated definitively. Of these, 51 had STI and 50 had BCI. Of the 51 patients with STI, 42 were treated with CRT, 5 patients were treated with resection followed by CRT, and 4 patients were treated with radiotherapy alone. Of the 50 patients with BCI, 26 patients were treated with CRT, 20 patients were treated with radical resection followed by radiotherapy or CRT, and 4 patients were treated with radiotherapy alone. Five-year local-regional control was 51% and 43% for STI and BCI patients treated with CRT, respectively, and 44% for BCI treated with radical resection. Five-year overall survival was 23%, 51%, and 28% for STI treated with CRT, BCI treated with CRT, and BCI treated with radical resection. Outcomes were not statistically different between these groups. CONCLUSION(S):: This study suggests similar outcomes for CRT or resection followed up with chemoradiotherapy for patients with locally advanced SCCHN with BCI. Concurrent CRT may be viable alternative to upfront resection in these patients. Further studies should be performed to validate these provocative findings.

1626,"Comparison of a safety strategy using transradial access and dual-axis rotational coronary angiography with transfemoral access and standard coronary angiography. Objectives We sought to investigate the radiation exposure and contrast utilization associated with using a strategy of transradial access and rotational angiography (radial-DARCA) compared to the traditional approach of transfemoral access and standard angiography (femoral-SA). Background There is an increased focus on optimizing patient safety during cardiac catheterization procedures. Professional guidelines have highlighted physician responsibility to minimize radiation doses and contrast volume. Dual axis rotational coronary angiography (DARCA) is the most recently investigated type of rotational angiography. This new technique permits complete visualization of the left or right coronary tree with a single injection, and is felt to reduce contrast and radiation exposure. Methods A total of 56 consecutive patients who underwent radial-DARCA were identified. From the same time period, an age- and gender-matched group of 61 patients who had femoral-SA were selected for comparison. Total volume of contrast agent used, fluoroscopy time, and 2 measures of radiation dose (dose area product and air kerma) were recorded for each group. Results Mean contrast agent use and patient radiation exposure of the radial-DARCA group were significantly less than that of the femoral-SA group. There was no significant difference in fluoroscopy time between the 2 groups. Conclusions Physicians can successfully employ an innovative safety strategy of transradial access combined with DARCA that is feasible and is associated with lower radiation doses and contrast volume than femoral artery access and traditional coronary angiography approach. © 2013, Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",Excluded
1623,"Epidemiology of lung cancer in women: A hospital-based descriptive study. Objective: Lung cancer required much greater attention as it is the most common cause of death. According to statistics in 2010, 85% of lung cancer in men and 57% in women are attributed to tobacco smoking. The aim of the study was to describe the clinical and pathologic characteristics of the female patients who visited the Department of Medical Oncology of Acibadem Maslak Hospital between 2009 and 2017. Material(s) and Method(s): Clinicopathologic data collected for analyses included age at diagnosis, history of cigarette use, comorbid conditions, family history, tumor-node-metastasis stage, pathologic subtypes of lung carcinoma, and the given therapy. From July 2017 to February 2018, we collected data of 540 female patients with lung cancer at the Department of Medical Oncology of Acibadem Maslak Hospital. Result(s): Among 540 patients, 185 patients (34.3%) were nonsmokers, 106 (19.6%) were current smokers, and 210 (38.9%) were former smokers. Data on common comorbid conditions such as hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and coronary artery disease were collected, and the conditions were classified according to the smoking status of the patients. Among current and former smokers, 36.7% were diagnosed with hypertension, 18.3% with diabetes mellitus, and 11% with coronary artery diseases. Moreover, 75% of all patients were diagnosed with nonsmall-cell lung cancer (NSCLC), whereas 16% were diagnosed with small-cell lung cancer. Adenocarcinoma is the most common histological type of cancer seen in patients with NSCLC (77%), followed by patients with squamous cell carcinoma (15%). Conclusion(s): Factors other than tobacco use, such as radon exposure, air pollution, radiation exposure, and an unbalanced diet are responsible for the increasing incidence of lung cancer. However, further studies are warranted to investigate the cause of the epidemic differences in women, particularly the gender bias in nonsmoker patients with lung cancer.Copyright © 2020 by Turkish Society of Medical Oncology.",Excluded

In this study, point mutation and common deletion (CD) mutations were investigated in 23 samples of NPC tumor tissue and in the radiation-treated NPC cell line CNE2. Polymorphisms at 72 (7.28%, 72/988) nucleotide positions in D-loop region and 6 (0.75%, 6/795) nucleotide positions in part of the functional gene encoding regions were detected in all NPC patients. Of the detected polymorphisms, 8 are novel. These variants are nonencoding transitions, including np292T-->C , np517G-del, np16038A-->G, np513G-del, np16242C-->A, np513G-del, np16242C-->A and np15787T-->C transition. A total of 39 point mutations in the D-loop region of mtDNA were detected in 43.5% (10/23) of the NPC patients. Three point mutations in the functional gene encoding regions of mtDNA were detected in only 8.7% (2/23) of NPC patients. The effect of he mutation at np709G-->A in the 12sRNA gene is unclear, and the A-->G substitution at np15769 in the cytochrome B gene is a synonymous mutation. The C-->T substitution at np15970 in the T Psi C loop of the tRNA(pro) gene could alter the position of the proline residue. After irradiation, the survival fraction of CNE2 cells decreased as X-ray dose increased. Moreover, X-ray radiation could induce apoptosis and the CD mutation in a time- and dose-dependent manner, but did not induce mtDNA point mutations. A positive correlation between the apoptosis index and the ratio of CD/WT mtDNA was observed in irradiated CNE2 cells. Our results suggest that CD mutation induced by irradiation is one of the late events after apoptosis of the cancer cells, and the mtDNA CD mutation may associated with the susceptibility of NPC cells to IR-induced apoptosis.",Excluded
2359,"Strategic lithotripsy using the Doli S EMSE 220 F-XP for the management of staghorn renal calculi. Aim: The presentation of our results using the Dornier lithotripter (Doli) S electromagnetic shockwave emitter (EMSE) 220 F-XP for the strategic management of staghorn renal calculi. Method(s): Sixteen patients with renal staghorn stones of more than 35 mm in maximum length on plain X-rays were treated by shock wave lithotripsy (SWL) monotherapy with the Doli S EMSE 220 F-XP. Double-J ureteral stent was inserted to all prior to the first SWL treatment. Shock wave counts varied from 2,500 to 3,600 with a shock release frequency of 70-80 pulses per minute. The number of sessions varied from 2 to 6. The interval between the SWL sessions was around 1 month. Fragmentation rate of 20-25% of the stone load per session was considered a valid criterion for progressing to further SWL sessions. Result(s): Nine patients became stone free at the end of SWL sessions and two patients had renal stone fragments smaller than 4 mm, which were eliminated 6 months later. Two patients developed streinstrasse that was managed with ureteroscopy. Auxiliary SWL was also performed on three patients with residual ureteral calculi. The mean follow up period was 12 months. The remaining five patients underwent open surgery for incomplete stone fragmentation. No major complications developed during the follow up period. The predominant composition of stones available for analysis was struvite. Conclusion(s): Doli S EMSE 220 F-XP can be a safe and effective treatment option for renal staghorn stones on an outpatient basis. © 2010 Springer Science+Business Media, B.V.",Excluded
3133,"Primary orbital meningioma: a study of six cases at a single institution. Primary orbital meningioma is a rare tumor of the anterior visual pathway and constitutes approximately 2% of all orbital tumors and 1-2% of all meningiomas. The differentiation from secondary orbital meningioma of intracranial origin is sometimes difficult on image. As the tumor often leads to visual loss if left untreated and surgical intervention inevitably causes morbidity, the timing and modality of treatment are very important. We carried out the study involving six cases (mean age: 42.7 years, male to female ratio: 1:5) of primary orbital meningioma to further elucidate its behavior. The clinical signs and symptoms, diagnosis, treatment strategies, and follow-up information are recorded for all cases. The most frequent initial symptoms were visual complaints (100%) and proptosis (67%). In five cases, the diagnosis was based on pathologic findings and the tumors were all grade I meningiomas. In one case, however, the diagnosis was based on radiographic and clinical findings, lacking histologic confirmation. Five patients were operated on, four underwent tumor removal, and one received eyeball exenteration. One patient was treated with Novalis radiotherapy. The mean follow-up period was 8.8 years (range from 9 months to 15 years). All patients experienced loss of vision during the course without exception. No recurrent tumor was found in five cases during follow-up. In case 5, whose eyeball was exenterated, developed recurrent meningioma 7 years later. She received radiotherapy but the tumor was out of control. She expired 8 years after eyeball exenteration. The primary orbital meningioma is aggressive in behavior despite its benign histopathologic features. Loss of vision is frequently seen even after treatment. The tumor could be fatal if surgery and radiotherapy fail to control its intracranial extension.",Excluded
299,"Utility of cone beam computed tomography verification after stereoscopic kV localization in head and neck tumors treated by stereotactic body radiation therapy. Purpose/Objective(s): Stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) for tumors of the head and neck is an emerging technique gaining popularity as literature regarding its efficacy and safety continues to grow. At our institution, we utilize an x-ray 6D image-guided radiation therapy system (combined infrared-based optical positioning and stereoscopic kV pair localization) for patient positioning followed by soft tissue verification with cone beam CT (CBCT). Here, we identify the magnitude of correction based on CBCT verification after stereoscopic kV pair localization for various anatomic sites of the head and neck and identify subsites in which planning target volume (PTV) margins may be reduced or CBCT may be eliminated. Materials/Methods: The retrospective record was reviewed for patients undergoing SBRT for head and neck tumors between the dates of 6/1/15 and 12/31/15. Patients who received intra-fraction image guidance by stereoscopic kV pair imaging followed by CBCT verification were identified. The magnitude and direction of applied shifts based on CBCT imaging in the vertical, longitudinal, and lateral directions were recorded, from which the vector magnitude of each shift in three dimensions was calculated. Result(s): Thirty-three patients were treated with SBRT for head and neck pathology in the 6-month time period, of which 19 received stereoscopic kV pair localization followed by CBCT verification. For each of the 69 treatments delivered by this method, the vector magnitude was calculated for each shift. The average of these magnitudes was 1.77 mm >=1.75 mm (mean >= standard deviation). For skull base and cervical spine treatments (n = 41), the mean isocenter shift was 1.53 mm >= 1.41 mm, compared to 2.12 mm >= 2.12 mm for non-skull base, non-spine head and neck treatments (n = 28). Conclusion(s): Shifts based on soft tissue localization by CBCT after positioning by stereoscopic kV imaging were typically less than 2 mm for the head and neck treatments in this series, particularly in those treatments directed towards the skull base or cervical spine. For head and neck tumors treated with SBRT near bony anatomy, CBCT verification may not be necessary after stereoscopic kV localization provided that an additional 2 mm margin is added to the PTV in quadrature.",Excluded
184,"A prospective study comparing the predictions of doctors versus models for treatment outcome of lung cancer patients: a step toward individualized care and shared decision making. BACKGROUND: Decision Support Systems, based on statistical prediction models, have the potential to change the way medicine is being practiced, but their application is currently hampered by the astonishing lack of impact studies. Showing the theoretical benefit of using these models could stimulate conductance of such studies. In addition, it would pave the way for developing more advanced models, based on genomics, proteomics and imaging information, to further improve the performance of the models., PURPOSE: In this prospective single-center study, previously developed and validated statistical models were used to predict the two-year survival (2yrS), dyspnea (DPN), and dysphagia (DPH) outcomes for lung cancer patients treated with chemo radiation. These predictions were compared to probabilities provided by doctors and guideline-based recommendations currently used. We hypothesized that model predictions would significantly outperform predictions from doctors., MATERIALS AND METHODS: Experienced radiation oncologists (ROs) predicted all outcomes at two timepoints: (1) after the first consultation of the patient, and (2) after the radiation treatment plan was made. Differences in the performances of doctors and models were assessed using Area Under the Curve (AUC) analysis., RESULTS: A total number of 155 patients were included. At timepoint #1 the differences in AUCs between the ROs and the models were 0.15, 0.17, and 0.20 (for 2yrS, DPN, and DPH, respectively), with p-values of 0.02, 0.07, and 0.03. Comparable differences at timepoint #2 were not statistically significant due to the limited number of patients. Comparison to guideline-based recommendations also favored the models., CONCLUSION: The models substantially outperformed ROs' predictions and guideline-based recommendations currently used in clinical practice. Identification of risk groups on the basis of the models facilitates individualized treatment, and should be further investigated in clinical impact studies. Copyright © 2014 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

3060,"Climate is a strong predictor of near-infrared reflectance but a poor predictor of colour in butterflies. Colour variation across climatic gradients is a common ecogeographical pattern; yet there is long-standing contention over underlying causes, particularly selection for thermal benefits. We tested the evolutionary association between climate gradients and reflectance of near-infrared (NIR) wavelengths, which influence heat gain but are not visible to animals. We measured ultraviolet (UVA), visible (Vis) and NIR reflectance from calibrated images of 372 butterfly specimens from 60 populations (49 species, five families) spanning the Australian continent. Consistent with selection for thermal benefits, the association between climate and reflectance was stronger for NIR than UVA-Vis wavelengths. Furthermore, climate predicted reflectance of the thorax and basal wing, which are critical to thermoregulation; but it did not predict reflectance of the entire wing, which has a variable role in thermoregulation depending on basking behaviour. These results provide evidence that selection for thermal benefits has shaped the reflectance properties of butterflies.",Excluded
349,"Medical monitoring: A beneficial remedy for residents living near an environmental hazard site. Objective: People living close to an environmental hazard site may suffer health harms from real or perceived contaminant exposures. In class-action litigation, medical monitoring is a potential remedy that has been allowed in some jurisdictions but not others. From 1952 to 1989, a US Department of Energy uranium metal plant near Fernald, Ohio, released ionizing radiation and uranium particulates into the surrounding community. Method(s): Settlement of litigation between nearby residents and the Department of Energy resulted in an 18-year medical monitoring program (N = 9775), which focused on general health promotion rather than effects of uranium. Result(s): Participation was higher than projected; decreases in common risk factors (cholesterol and blood pressure) and deaths from cancer have been observed.

3705,"Reproducibility of intensity-based estimates of lung ventilation. Purpose: Lung function depends on lung expansion and contraction during the respiratory cycle. Respiratory-gated CT imaging and image registration can be used to estimate the regional lung volume change by observing CT voxel density changes during inspiration or expiration. In this study, the authors examine the reproducibility of intensity-based estimates of lung tissue expansion and contraction in three mechanically ventilated sheep and ten spontaneously breathing humans. The intensity-based estimates are compared to the estimates of lung function derived from image registration deformation field. Method(s): 4DCT data set was acquired for a cohort of spontaneously breathing humans and anesthetized and mechanically ventilated sheep. For each subject, two 4DCT scans were performed with a short time interval between acquisitions. From each 4DCT data set, an image pair consisting of a volume reconstructed near end inspiration and a volume reconstructed near end exhalation was selected. The end inspiration and end exhalation images were registered using a tissue volume preserving deformable registration algorithm. The CT density change in the registered image pair was used to compute intensity-based specific air volume change (SAC) and the intensity-based Jacobian (IJAC), while the transformation-based Jacobian (TJAC) was computed directly from the image registration deformation field. IJAC is introduced to make the intensity-based and transformation-based methods comparable since SAC and Jacobian may not be associated with the same physiological phenomenon and have different units. Scan-to-scan variations in respiratory effort were corrected using a global scaling factor for normalization. A gamma index metric was introduced to quantify voxel-by-voxel reproducibility considering both differences in ventilation and distance between matching voxels. The authors also tested how different CT prefiltering levels affected intensity-based ventilation reproducibility. Result(s): Higher reproducibility was found for anesthetized mechanically ventilated animals than for the humans for both the intensity-based (IJAC) and transformation-based (TJAC) ventilation estimates. The human IJAC maps had scan-to-scan correlation coefficients of 0.45 +/- 0.14, a gamma pass rate 70 +/- 8 without normalization and 75 +/- 5 with normalization. The human TJAC maps had correlation coefficients 0.81 +/- 0.10, a gamma pass rate 86 +/- 11 without normalization and 93 +/- 4 with normalization. The gamma pass rate and correlation coefficient of the IJAC maps gradually increased with increased smoothing, but were still much lower than those of the TJAC maps. Conclusion(s): The transformation-based ventilation maps show better reproducibility than the intensity-based maps, especially in human subjects. Reproducibility was also found to depend on variations in respiratory effort; all techniques were better when applied to images from mechanically ventilated sheep compared to spontaneously breathing human subjects. Nevertheless, intensity-based techniques applied to mechanically ventilated sheep were less reproducible than the transformation-based applied to spontaneously breathing humans, suggesting the method used to determine ventilation maps is important. Prefiltering of the CT images may help to improve the reproducibility of the intensity-based ventilation estimates, but even with filtering the reproducibility of the intensity-based ventilation estimates is not as good as that of transformation-based ventilation estimates. © 2013 American Association of Physicists in Medicine.",Excluded
1632,"Patterns of diagnostic imaging and associated radiation exposure among long-term survivors of young adult cancer: a population-based cohort study. BACKGROUND: Survivors of young adult malignancies are at risk of accumulated exposures to radiation from repetitive diagnostic imaging. We designed a population-based cohort study to describe patterns of diagnostic imaging and cumulative diagnostic radiation exposure among survivors of young adult cancer during a survivorship time period where surveillance imaging is not typically warranted., METHODS: Young adults aged 20-44 diagnosed with invasive malignancy in Ontario from 1992-1999 who lived at least 5 years from diagnosis were identified using the Ontario Cancer Registry and matched 5 to 1 to randomly selected cancer-free persons. We determined receipt of 5 modalities of diagnostic imaging and associated radiation dose received by survivors and controls from years 5-15 after diagnosis or matched referent date through administrative data. Matched pairs were censored six months prior to evidence of recurrence., RESULTS: 20,911 survivors and 104,524 controls had a median of 13.5 years observation. Survivors received all modalities of diagnostic imaging at significantly higher rates than controls. Survivors received CT at a 3.49-fold higher rate (95% Confidence Interval [CI]:3.37, 3.62) than controls in years 5 to 15 after diagnosis. Survivors received a mean radiation dose of 26 miliSieverts solely from diagnostic imaging in the same time period, a 4.57-fold higher dose than matched controls (95% CI: 4.39, 4.81)., CONCLUSIONS: Long-term survivors of young adult cancer have a markedly higher rate of diagnostic imaging over time than matched controls, imaging associated with substantial radiation exposure, during a time period when surveillance is not routinely recommended.",Excluded
180,"Effectiveness of Nd: YAG laser therapy on Japanese cedar pollinosis. Many have reported on the effectiveness of laser surgery therapy for perennial allergic rhinitis. However, the suppressive effects of laser irradiation on allergic rhinitis and its symptoms have not been reported in patients with pollinosis. This is because therapeutic effects on pollinosis are difficult to evaluate. The amount of pollen in the air varies during the year, and from year to year. Also, allergic symptoms develop due to exposure to the amount of pollen which is markedly influenced by the weather. In this study, the severity of allergic symptoms in the pollen season was compared between patients treated with early medication, non-treated patients and patients treated with preseasonal contact Nd: YAG laser surgery. Results suggests that laser surgery was effective in reducing the severity of symptoms in patients with cedar pollinosis. Symptoms were milder in the laser group than in the medication group and non-treated group for 3-4 weeks after the start of seasonal pollinosis, although no differences were noted in the early weeks. This may be explained by the fact that laser irradiation reduces the lamina propria of the nasal mucosa, the site of allergic reactions. This also suggests that allergic pollen can't penetrate the mucosal surface which shows squamous epithelization after laser irradiation.",Excluded
3226,Cord blood transplantation using minimum conditioning regimens for patients with hematologic malignancies complicated by severe infections. Patients with severe infections are thought to be ineligible for cord blood stem cell transplantation (CBT) because the conventional 5-6 day-conditioning regimens potentially makes them susceptible to fatal infections by the time neutrophil engraftment occurs. Two patients were treated with minimum conditioning regimens consisting of 30 mg/m2 fludarabin (Flu) and 2 g/m2 cyclophosphamide (CY) on day-1 and total body irradiation (TBI) of 2 or 4 Gy on day -1 or 0 followed by single unit CBT. The reasons for adopting such weak regimen were febrile neutropenia due to the rejection of the first cord blood (CB) graft given to a patient with follicular lymphoma resistant to chemotherapy and pulmonary aspergillosis in another patient with AML who relapsed after CBT. The AML patient received 40 mg/m2 of melphalan on day-2 to reduce the leukemia burden. Both patients achieved 100% donor chimerism by day 19 and day 20 after CBT without an apparent exacerbation of the infections and remained in remission at 23 and 18 months after the CBT. These findings suggest that the 1-2 day regimens excluding antihuman thymocyte globulin may be sufficiently potent to ensure engraftment of CB in immunocompromised patients and safely administered even when patients are complicated by active infections. © 2008 The Japanese Society of Hematology.,Excluded
799,"Implications of somatic mutations in the AML1 gene in radiation-associated and therapy-related myelodysplastic syndrome/acute myeloid leukemia. Somatically acquired point mutations of AML1/RUNX1 gene have been recently identified in rare cases of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS). Moreover, germ line mutations of AML1 were found in an autosomal dominant disease, familial platelet disorder with predisposition to AML (FPD/AML), suggesting that AML1 mutants, as well as AML1 chimeras, contribute to the transformation of hematopoietic progenitors. In this report, we showed that AML1 point mutations were found in 6 (46%) of 13 MDS patients among atomic bomb (A-bomb) survivors in Hiroshima. Unlike acute or chronic leukemia patients among A-bomb survivors, MDS patients exposed relatively low-dose radiation and developed the disease after a long latency period. AML1 mutations also were found in 5 (38%) of 13 therapy-related AML/MDS patients who were treated with alkylating agents with or without local radiation therapy. In contrast, frequency of AML1 mutation in sporadic MDS patients was 2.7% (2 of 74). Among AML1 mutations identified in this study, truncated-type mutants lost DNA binding potential and trans-activation activity. All missense mutations with one exception (Gly42Arg) lacked DNA binding ability and down-regulated the trans-activation potential of wild-type AML1 in a dominant-negative fashion. The Gly42Arg mutation that was shared by 2 patients bound DNA even more avidly than wild-type AML1 and enhanced the trans-activation potential of normal AML1. These results suggest that AML1 point mutations are related to low-dose radiation or alkylating agents and play a role distinct from that of leukemogenic chimeras as a result of chromosomal translocations caused by sublethal radiation or topoisomerase II inhibitors.",Excluded

2917,"Work history and radioprotection practices in relation to cancer incidence and mortality in US radiologic technologists performing nuclear medicine procedures. Introduction Technologists working in nuclear medicine (NM) are exposed to higher radiation doses than most other occupationally exposed populations. The aim of this study was to estimate the risk of cancer in NM technologists in relation to work history, procedures performed and radioprotection practices. Methods From the US Radiologic Technologists cohort study, 72 755 radiologic technologists who completed a 2003-2005 questionnaire were followed for cancer mortality through 31 December 2012 and for cancer incidence through completion of a questionnaire in 2012-2013. Multivariable-adjusted models were used to estimate HRs for total cancer incidence and mortality by history of ever performing NM procedures and frequency of performing specific diagnostic or therapeutic NM procedures and associated radiation protection measures by decade. Results During follow-up (mean=7.5 years), 960 incident cancers and 425 cancer deaths were reported among the 22 360 technologists who worked with NM procedures. We observed no increased risk of cancer incidence (HR 0.96, 95% CI 0.89 to 1.04) or death (HR 1.05, 95% CI 0.93 to 1.19) among workers who ever performed NM procedures. HRs for cancer incidence but not mortality were higher for technologists who began performing therapeutic procedures in 1960 and later compared with the 1950s. Frequency of performing diagnostic or therapeutic NM procedures and use of radioprotection measures were not consistently associated with cancer risk. No clear associations were observed for specific cancers, but results were based on small numbers. Conclusion Cancer incidence and mortality were not associated with NM work history practices, including greater frequency of procedures performed.Copyright © Article author(s) (or their employer(s) unless otherwise stated in the text of the article) 2018.

This study deals with 4971 implants (Branemark system) installed in 1315 patients, either fully or partially edentulous, and followed from implant installation up to the last control. A predominance of female patients (61%) and a nearly equal number of upper and lower jaws characterised the study group. Patients were scheduled each 6-12 months for recall. The observation time varied from 0.5 to 15 years (mean 5.1). The whole cohort was split up into compromised (n = 59) and non-compromised (n = 1256) patients. The former are defined as grafted (autologous bone) and patients irradiated in the head and neck area. In the compromised patients 24 out of 59 patients (40.6%) showed failures, in whom 59 out of 310 (19%) implants failed. In the non-compromised patients, implant failures were observed in 11.6% of the patients, which corresponds to 5.9% of the installed implants, excluding iatrogenic failures. Failures were further divided chronologically into early (up to 1 year after abutment connection) and late failures. There were early implant failures in 12.5% of the compromised patients and in 3.4% of the others. Late implant failures occurred in 7.4 and 2% of the two patients groups, respectively. While gender did not affect the failure rate, implant lengths, corresponding to the available bone height did, since a 21.5% failure rate for the 7-mm implants contrasts with 4.1 and 3.8% for 13- and 15-mm implants, respectively. Early as well as annual late failures are more frequently found in the maxilla. Implant fractures only occurred in the fixed (both partial and full) prosthesis group but never surpassed the 0.2% annual level. Marginal bone loss, exceeding the third screw thread occurred in 1.8% of the implants at the last control. It appears that this type of implant configuration offers a high long-term predictability. Failures occur before, at or during the first year after abutment connection and in very short implants. Marginal bone as a whole is very stable over the years.",Excluded

BACKGROUND: Nowadays, angiography systems with flat digital panel are used in cardiology and invasive radiology as the detector of irradiation. The so called universal systems with a magnified panel are becoming more common. In this study we tried to find out whether in practice the increased surface area of detectors may increase the absorption dose in a patient., MATERIAL AND METHODS: The study included 486 patients who underwent coronary angiography carried out by the same physicians. In 268 subjects the procedure was performed in cathlab A equipped with a cardiac angiography system, whereas in 218 subjects in cathlab B using universal angiography system. In the study the absorbed dose of irradiation by the patient was determined and its ratio to body mass, body mass index (BMI) and body surface area (BSA) was evaluated., RESULTS: The mean dose absorbed by the person under study did not differ between both catheterization laboratories. Similarly, there were no differences in the ratio of the absorbed dose and BMI. But the comparison of the ratio of the absorbed dose and the body mass showed significantly higher values in cathlab A, where. higher values of the ratio of the absorbed dose and BSA were also found (p < 0.01)., CONCLUSIONS: In the present study it was found that the use of universal angiography systems with a larger surface area of the detecting panel is not connected with the increase in the irradiation dose absorbed by the patent during coronary angiography as compared with classical cardiac angiography systems.",Excluded
3182,"Calcium pyrophosphate crystal deposition in a cohort of 52 patients with Gitelman Syndrome. Background: Gitelman syndrome (GS) is a rare recessively inherited tubulop-athy, caused by inactive mutations in SLC12A3 gene encoding the thiazide-sensi-tive-sodium-chloride transporter. It is characterized by an hypokalemic metabolic alkalosis with hypomagnesemia and hypocalciuria. Calcium pyrophosphate (CPP) crystal deposition is frequently described in GS case-reports but its prevalence and clinical phenotype are unknown. Objective(s): The aim is to describe clinical, biological and radiological features of CPP in a cohort of patients with genetically proven GS. Method(s): All patients (pts) with genetically proven GS in the French national reference center of rare diseases were proposed to have a consultation with a senior rheumatologist. Demographic data, history of joint pain and flare and biology disorders were recorded. Other causes of CPP disease were systematically ruled out. CPP crystal deposition was assessed by X-rays (all peripheral joints and cervical spine) and ultrasonography (US) (wrist, knee, ankle joints and symptomatic joints). Patients with history of cervical pain underwent computed tomography (CT) of the full cervical spine from occipital bone to C1-T1 disk, including temporomandibular joints. Result(s): Fifty-two GS pts (21 men, mean age 46.5+/- 12.2 years) have been examined by a rheumatologist. Almost all patients had an heterozygous mutation on SLC12A3 gene. Forty-four pts experienced joint pain (84.6%), 23 joint flares (44,2%) and 25 cervical pain (48.1%). X-rays were performed in 42 pts, US in 38 and CT in 23. CPP depositions were observed in 36 (85.7%), 27 (71.1%) and 15 pts (65.2%) by X-rays, US and CT, respectively. All techniques combined, chondrocalcinosis was discovered in 42 patients. Deposits occurred in knees (n=32), wrists (n=29), cervical spine (n=23), ankles and feet (n=22) and shoulders (n=16). CPP depositions were widespread involving at least 3 joints in 27 (55.1%) pts. In knees, CPP depositions involved menisci (n=24), hyaline cartilages (n=16) and ligament or joint capsule (n=15). Cervical spine CT demonstrated CPP deposition in vertebral discs (n=17), transverse ligament (n=13), other ligament (n=13), vertebral facets (n=3) and temporo-mandibular joints (n=5). Patients with CPP crystal deposition in more than 3 joints were significantly older (52.8+/-10.5 years) than patients with 2 or 3 affected joints (40.8+/-11.6 years, p=0.02) or patients without any affected joint (36.6+/-8.1 years, p=0.001). They were also more symptomatic with significantly more joint flares (p<0.0001). Mag-nesemia was inversely correlated with the number of affected joints: patients with >3 or 2-3 affected joints had a significantly lower magnesemia (0.57+/-0.1 and 0.59 +/-0.1 mM, respectively) than patients with only 1 affected joint (0.83+/-0.1 mM). CPP crystal deposition was not associated with potassium level. (Table Presented).",Excluded
1146,"Radiation-induced micro-RNA expression changes in peripheral blood cells of radiotherapy patients. Purpose: MicroRNAs (miRNAs), a class of noncoding small RNAs that regulate gene expression, are involved in numerous physiologic processes in normal and malignant cells. Our in vivo study measured miRNA and gene expression changes in human blood cells in response to ionizing radiation, to develop miRNA signatures that can be used as biomarkers for radiation exposure. Methods and Materials: Blood from 8 radiotherapy patients in complete remission 1 or 2 was collected immediately before and 4 hours after total body irradiation with 1.25 Gy x-rays. Both miRNA and gene expression changes were measured by means of quantitative polymerase chain reaction and microarray hybridization, respectively. Hierarchic clustering, multidimensional scaling, class prediction, and gene ontology analysis were performed to investigate the potential of miRNAs to serve as radiation biomarkers and to elucidate their likely physiologic roles in the radiation response. Result(s): The expression levels of 45 miRNAs were statistically significantly upregulated 4 hours after irradiation with 1.25 Gy x-rays, 27 of them in every patient. Nonirradiated and irradiated samples form separate clusters in hierarchic clustering and multidimensional scaling. Out of 223 differentially expressed genes, 37 were both downregulated and predicted targets of the upregulated miRNAs. Paired and unpaired miRNA-based classifiers that we developed can predict the class membership of a sample with unknown irradiation status, with accuracies of 100% when all 45 upregulated miRNAs are included. Both miRNA control of and gene involvement in biologic processes such as hemopoiesis and the immune response are increased after irradiation, whereas metabolic processes are underrepresented among all differentially expressed genes and the genes controlled by miRNAs. Conclusion(s): Exposure to ionizing radiation leads to the upregulation of the expression of a considerable proportion of the human miRNAome of peripheral blood cells. These miRNA expression signatures can be used as biomarkers of radiation exposure. © 2011 Elsevier Inc.",Excluded
2951,"Is lateral opening of the cup related to pelvic tilt on the surgical table?. Introduction: Surgical table and floor are the usual references for positioning the cup. This is correct if pelvis is perpendicular to them (tilt 0degree). But if shoulder girdle is wider than pelvic girdle, pelvis will be tilted towards the feet. And if shoulder girdle is narrower than pelvic girdle, pelvis will be tilted towards the head. Objective(s): To analyse pelvic tilt on surgical table ant its influence on lateral opening of the cup. Method(s): Prospective, blind, observational study. Fifty THA patients (26 female), 1 department, multiple surgeons. Lateral decubitus, horizontal surgical table, conventional anterior (pubic) and posterior (lumbar spine) supports. Preoperative measures: (with custom-made measuring device) width of shoulder and pelvic girdles, pelvic tilt (angle between horizontal surgical table and a line by both antero-superior iliac spines), pelvic tilt towards head or feet. Postero-lateral approach. Theoretical position of cup intended by surgeons: 45degree valgus. Post-surgical x-ray: measure of lateral opening of cup.

Radiographic lateral opening of the cup: 43 +/- 10degree. 3/50 (2 males): pelvic girdle width similar to shoulder girdle, pelvic tilt 7 +/- 2degree towards feet, theoretical risk of vertical cup. Radiographic valgus of cup: 43.8degree. 26/50 (18 males): shoulder girdle 23 mm wider than pelvis (male phenotype), pelvic tilt 1 +/- 5degree towards feet, theoretical risk of vertical cup. Radiographic valgus of cup: 45 +/- 9degree. No result is statistically significant. Conclusion(s): 1) Different widths of shoulder and pelvic girdles could theoretically influence pelvic tilt of patients in lateral decubitus on surgical table. 2) But actually most patients present a minor pelvic tilt. 3) The average radiographic valgus of cups is near 45degree, but the standard deviation is great and an important number is out of recommended range.",Excluded
1316,"Reducing computed tomography utilization in the evaluation of renal colic in the emergency department. Study Objective: Evaluation of suspected kidney stones make up more than 1 million visits to emergency departments (ED) annually. Renal colic is frequently evaluated with the use of computed tomography (CT), the use of which has greatly increased in recent years. CT for suspected kidney stone has not been shown to improve patient outcomes but is associated with increased exposure to radiation, increased cost and increased ED length of stay. Method(s): In this project, a two-hospital community-based emergency medicine group and the local Regional Collaborative Care Organization (RCCO) began a joint project with the intent to improve the delivery of care to all patients. The goal of our project was to reduce CT imaging in the evaluation of renal colic in the ED to reduce costs, reduce exposure to radiation, and make CT imaging more available for emergent conditions. An educational program was used to support providers in the ED in reduction of total use of CT in the evaluation of patients. This included ultrasound education along with understanding of the cost, radiation exposure and use model for evaluation of suspected renal colic. A monitoring and feedback system was implemented. A care pathway was developed to help with the decisionmaking process and to facilitate a more standardized approach to care. Result(s): All patients seen and evaluated at the two sites were included in the data set. A baseline in utilization was established for all patients from 7/1/14 to 12/31/14. Education and pathways were introduced in the first half of 2015. Data was collected in the same manner for 7/1/15 to 12/31/15. The data was reviewed for individual providers as well as a department as a whole. Data is reported as a number of studies performed per 1000 patients seen for all complaints. The baseline data demonstrated utilization at site #1 at 21.60 and site #2 at 16.45 per 1000 patients. The post implementation data for site #1 is 13.01 and site #2 is 10.40 per 1000 patients. This represents areductionof 40%atsite #1 and 37% at site #2. The combinedresult of the two sites was a reduction from 17.17 to 10.94 per 1000 patients seen or a reduction of 38%. The overall reduction in the six months of data collection was from 1208 total scans to 753 or a change of 455 scans for essentially the same volume of total patients seen in the ED (68,196 base versus 68,804 after). There was a 32% decrease in variability in practice looking at the individuals from baseline to post intervention. RCCO noted a decrease in their financial burden of their patients. In review of the RCCO supported patients comparing the full 2014 year to 2015 there was a reduction in exams for their patient population from 3493 to 2111 or a difference of 1382 (40% decrease). The cost savings to RCCO was $978,602 for that same period. Conclusion(s): The patients received more consistent goal-directed evaluation and care. Patients had a decrease in radiation. The financial burden was decreased. The facility was able to utilize the CT equipment for more timely care of critical patients. The physicians received education and support that will continue to assist in their delivery of care.",Excluded
1568,"Investigation of dosimetric variations of liver radiotherapy using deformable registration of planning CT and cone-beam CT. Many patients with technically unresectable or medically inoperable hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) had hepatic anatomy variations as a result of interfraction deformation during fractionated radiotherapy. We conducted this retrospective study to investigate interfractional normal liver dosimetric consequences via reconstructing weekly dose in HCC patients. Twenty-three patients with HCC received conventional fractionated three-dimensional conformal radiation therapy (3DCRT) were enrolled in this retrospective investigation. Among them, seven patients had been diagnosed of radiation-induced liver disease (RILD) and the other 16 patients had good prognosis after treatment course. The cone-beam CT (CBCT) scans were acquired once weekly for each patient throughout the treatment, deformable image registration (DIR) of planning CT (pCT) and CBCT was performed to acquire modified CBCT (mCBCT), and the structural contours were propagated by the DIR. The same plan was applied to mCBCT to perform dose calculation. Weekly dose distribution was displayed on the pCT dose space and compared using dose difference, target coverage, and dose volume histograms. Statistical analysis was performed to identify the significant dosimetric variations. Among the 23 patients, the three weekly normal liver D50 increased by 0.2 Gy, 4.2 Gy, and 4.7 Gy, respectively, for patients with RILD, and 1.0 Gy, 2.7 Gy, and 3.1 Gy, respectively, for patients without RILD. Mean dose to the normal liver (Dmean) increased by 0.5 Gy, 2.6 Gy, and 4.0 Gy, respectively, for patients with RILD, and 0.4 Gy, 3.1 Gy, and 3.4 Gy, respectively, for patients without RILD. Regarding patients with RILD, the average values of the third weekly D50 and Dmean were both over hepatic radiation tolerance, while the values of patients without RILD were below. The dosimetric consequence showed that the liver dose between patients with and without RILD were different relative to the planned dose, and the RILD patients suffered from liver dose over hepatic radiation tolerance. Evaluation of routinely acquired CBCT images during radiation therapy provides biological information on the organs at risk, and dose estimation based on mCBCT could potentially form the basis for personalized response adaptive therapy.

The present study reports the clinical outcomes of hypofractionated stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) for oligometastasis (OM) originating from various tumors. Between February 2012 and April 2017, 40 patients with unresectable OM were treated with SBRT. Of these patients, 92% showed a solitary nodal metastasis and the rest had up to three metas-tases. The dose prescription was 50 Gy in 10 fractions with three-dimensional conformal techniques or volumetric inten-sity-modulated arc therapy. Median follow-up was 14 months. Of the 40 patients, none showed local progression at the site of SBRT, but 20 patients showed tumor growth at distant sites during follow-up. The 2- and 3-year overall survival rates were 45.1 and 36.1%, respectively. The 2- and 3-year progression-free survival rates were 35.4 and 26.5%, respectively. The interval between diagnosis and detection of OM (<2 vs. >2 years) and primary tumor site (esophagus vs. others) emerged as significant variables affecting survival. Grade 3 subacute and grade 4 chronic toxicities were observed in 1 and 2 patients, respectively. SBRT of 50 Gy in 10 fractions for OM from various primary tumors was shown to lead to good clinical outcomes from the viewpoints of local control and toxicity frequency. However, additional studies are required to identify the patient groups likely to receive maximal benefits from such treatment.Copyright © 2020, Spandidos Publications. All rights reserved.",Excluded
33,"Interforaminal implant placement in oral cancer patients: during ablative surgery or delayed? A 5-year retrospective study. In a retrospective study, two mandibular prosthetic rehabilitation strategies supported by implants in oral cancer patients were evaluated: implants placed in the non-resected edentulous symphyseal area during ablative surgery (DAS implants); or at a later stage (postponed (P) implants). Medical files of patients from two head-neck oncology groups from 2000 to 2005 were screened for study inclusion. DAS protocol was used in one group and P protocol in the other. After a 5 year follow-up of 261 edentulous patients with oral cancer in the second group, P implants were placed in 27 patients to support an overdenture. Of the 249 edentulous patients in the first group, 82 patients were given an implant supported overdenture using the DAS implant protocol. Regarding implant loss, no statistically significant differences were seen between the DAS and P implants. In the DAS group, more patients benefited from an implant-supported lower overdenture (39 versus 11%, respectively), and they received their overdenture on average 20.0 months sooner (sd=11.01, p<0.001) after ablative surgery. 17.1% of DAS implants and 4.6% of P implants were never loaded due to tumour and patient related factors including unfavourable implant soft tissue, tumour recurrence near the implant, or radiotherapy induced trismus.

693,"Normal tissue complication models for clinically relevant acute esophagitis (>= grade 2) in patients treated with dose differentiated accelerated radiotherapy (DART-bid). BACKGROUND: One of the primary dose-limiting toxicities during thoracic irradiation is acute esophagitis (AE). The aim of this study is to investigate dosimetric and clinical predictors for AE grade >= 2 in patients treated with accelerated radiotherapy for locally advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC)., PATIENTS AND METHODS: 66 NSCLC patients were included in the present analysis: 4 stage II, 44 stage IIIA and 18 stage IIIB. All patients received induction chemotherapy followed by dose differentiated accelerated radiotherapy (DART-bid). Depending on size (mean of three perpendicular diameters) tumors were binned in four dose groups: <2.5 cm 73.8 Gy, 2.5-4.5 cm 79.2 Gy, 4.5-6 cm 84.6 Gy, >6 cm 90 Gy. Patients were treated in 3D target splitting technique. In order to estimate the normal tissue complication probability (NTCP), two Lyman models and the cutoff-logistic regression model were fitted to the data with AE >= grade 2 as statistical endpoint. Inter-model comparison was performed with the corrected Akaike information criterion (AICc), which calculates the model's quality of fit (likelihood value) in relation to its complexity (i.e. number of variables in the model) corrected by the number of patients in the dataset. Toxicity was documented prospectively according to RTOG., RESULTS: The median follow up was 686 days (range 84-2921 days), 23/66 patients (35 %) experienced AE >= grade 2. The actuarial local control rates were 72.6 % and 59.4 % at 2 and 3 years, regional control was 91 % at both time points. The Lyman-MED model (D50 = 32.8 Gy, m = 0.48) and the cutoff dose model (Dc = 38 Gy) provide the most efficient fit to the current dataset. On multivariate analysis V38 (volume of the esophagus that receives 38 Gy or above, 95 %-CI 28.2-57.3) was the most significant predictor of AE >= grade 2 (HR = 1.05, CI 1.01-1.09, p = 0.007)., CONCLUSION: Following high-dose accelerated radiotherapy the rate of AE >= grade 2 is slightly lower than reported for concomitant radio-chemotherapy with the additional benefit of markedly increased loco-regional tumor control. In the current patient cohort the most significant predictor of AE was found to be V38. A second clinically useful parameter in treatment planning may be MED (mean esophageal dose).",Excluded
2788,"Evaluation of automated lung nodule detection on low-dose computed tomography scans from a lung cancer screening program(1). RATIONALE AND OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the performance of a fully automated lung nodule detection method in a large database of low-dose computed tomography (CT) scans from a lung cancer screening program. Because nodules demonstrate a spectrum of radiologic appearances, the performance of the automated method was evaluated on the basis of nodule malignancy status, size, subtlety, and radiographic opacity., MATERIALS AND METHODS: A database of 393 thick-section (10 mm) low-dose CT scans was collected. Automated lung nodule detection proceeds in two phases: gray-level thresholding for the initial identification of nodule candidates, followed by the application of a rule-based classifier and linear discriminant analysis to distinguish between candidates that correspond to actual lung nodules and candidates that correspond to non-nodules. Free-response receiver operating characteristic analysis was used to evaluate the performance of the method based on a jackknife training/testing approach., RESULTS: An overall nodule detection sensitivity of 70% (330 of 470) was attained with an average of 1.6 false-positive detections per section. At the same false-positive rate, 83% (57 of 69) of the malignant lung nodules in the database were detected. When the method was trained specifically for malignant nodules, a sensitivity of 80% (55 of 69) was attained with 0.85 false-positives per section., CONCLUSION: We have evaluated an automated lung nodule detection method with a large number of low-dose CT scans from a lung cancer screening program. An overall sensitivity of 80% for malignant nodules was achieved with 0.85 false-positive detections per section. Such a computerized lung nodule detection method is expected to become an important part of CT-based lung cancer screening programs.",Excluded
2205,"A phase i study of nelfinavir concurrent with temozolomide and radiotherapy in patients with glioblastoma multiforme. We conducted a phase I trial to examine the maximally tolerated dose (MTD) of the oral protease inhibitor nelfinavir (NFV) in combination with temozolomide and concurrent radiotherapy in patients with glioblastoma and to gather preliminary data for response. The study was conducted in patients with newly diagnosed glioblastoma after surgical resection. Patients were treated with standard radiotherapy (6,000 cGy to the gross tumor volume), temozolomide (75 mg/m2 daily) together with daily oral NFV starting 7-10 days prior to chemoradiotherapy continuing for the duration of chemoradiation for 6 weeks. Temozolomide (150-200 mg/m2) was resumed 4 weeks after completion of chemoradiotherapy. Two dose levels of NFV were investigated: 625 mg twice daily (bid) and 1,250 mg bid in a cohort escalation design. A total of 21 patients were enrolled. At the maximum tolerated dose, 18 subjects were enrolled to further evaluate toxicity and for preliminary estimate of efficacy for further phase II study. No dose-limiting toxicity was noted at 625 mg bid. At 1,250 mg bid, 3 dose-limiting episodes of hepatotoxicity were noted and one dose-limiting episode of diarrhea. The MTD for this study was 1,250 mg bid. NFV (1,250 mg bid) concurrent with temozolomide and radiotherapy is tolerated in most patients with glioblastoma. At the 1,250 mg bid dose level, patients should be monitored for hepatotoxicity and GI side effects. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media New York.",Excluded
2728,"Preclinical evaluation of pions in vivo: experience at TRIUMF. This paper describes the results obtained from in vivo studies of the pion beam at the TRI University Meson Facility (TRIUMF). The studies encompass work (from 1978 to 1986), designed to evaluate the RBE for early and late effects and to assess the importance of X-ray dose rate and treatment volume on these values. Results with early responding tissues, i.e. mouse and pig skin and mouse intestine indicate a pion RBE of about 1.5 in the clinically relevant dose per fraction range of 2-3 Gy. At these doses, RBE appears to be independent of the reference X-ray dose rate. However, at high doses per fraction, the RBE values become increasingly X-ray dose rate dependent. The induction of late effects by pions has been assessed by monitoring the late dermal response of pig skin; late fibrosis was not assessed in this study. The values obtained using the chosen endpoint indicate that the RBE is not significantly higher than that seen in any of the early responding tissues for pion doses as low as 2-3 Gy per fraction. The effect of increasing the treatment volume for pion therapy has been assessed using mouse intestine. The results show that for a constant field size, RBE decreases with increasing peak width. However, if peak width is held constant and field size increased, there is evidence for an increased RBE.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",Excluded
3466,"CT urography in the urinary bladder: to compare excretory phase images using a low noise index and a high noise index with adaptive noise reduction filter. BACKGROUND: Although CT urography (CTU) is widely used for the evaluation of the entire urinary tract, the most important drawback is the radiation exposure., PURPOSE: To evaluate the effect of a noise reduction filter (NRF) using a phantom and to quantitatively and qualitatively compare excretory phase (EP) images using a low noise index (NI) with those using a high NI and postprocessing NRF (pNRF)., MATERIAL AND METHODS: Each NI value was defined for a slice thickness of 5 mm, and reconstructed images with a slice thickness of 1.25 mm were assessed. Sixty patients who were at high risk of developing bladder tumors (BT) were divided into two groups according to whether their EP images were obtained using an NI of 9.88 (29 patients; group A) or an NI of 20 and pNRF (31 patients; group B). The CT dose index volume (CTDI(vol)) and the contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR) of the bladder with respect to the anterior pelvic fat were compared in both groups. Qualitative assessment of the urinary bladder for image noise, sharpness, streak artifacts, homogeneity, and the conspicuity of polypoid or sessile-shaped BTs with a short-axis diameter greater than 10 mm was performed using a 3-point scale., RESULTS: The phantom study showed noise reduction of approximately 40% and 76% dose reduction between group A and group B. CTDI(vol) demonstrated a 73% reduction in group B (4.6 +/- 1.1 mGy) compared with group A (16.9 +/- 3.4 mGy). The CNR value was not significantly different (P = 0.60) between group A (16.1 +/- 5.1) and group B (16.6 +/- 7.6).

In his personal history there is also after low intensive trauma elbow and hip fracture in ages of 52 and 53. There are no other risk factor in personal and family history. DXA evaluation results: T-score total LS vertebrae -4.7 SD and T-score total -2.4 healthy hip. Laboratory tests: high rate of thyroid hormone and low rate of 25OH vitamin D. We started with treatment. Result(s): Osteoporosis is leading causes of morbidity and mortality in elderly. "" Silent disease"" progress without symptoms until a fractures occurred. Hip fracture is very serious complication. One fifth of it occurred in men but it rise about 10 years later than in woman. In 65-70 ages men loosing bone mass at the same rate as woman and the absorption of calcium decrease in both sex. For men before 65 years and high risk men recommendation is to begin periodic osteoporotic risk assessment and performing DXA. When we have diagnosis it is important to consider and exclude secondary causes of bone loss. It is almost certain lifestyle, diseases and medications. More than 40 % are primary or idiopathic osteoporosis in men. Careful history, physical examination and laboratory tests are enough component for making decision about treatment. Except medication men should be educated about adequate lifestyle measures as the prevention. Conclusion(s): Osteoporosis in men is an important and often overlooked problem. The consequences of it are underestimated and the condition is often unrecognised and untreated. There is no sufficient scientific based evidence for men osteoporosis.

The use of image techniques is becoming more popular to increase accuracy and safety. TAC-guided thoracic biopsy is the most commonly used method but thoracic ultrasound offers some advantages like: absence of ionizing radiations and bedside exploration. Our aim was to analyze effectiveness and safety of the ultrasound-guided pleural biopsies using a pocket size ultrasound device (PSUD). Method(s): A prospective, one-year study from January 2016 to January 2017 was carried out. We included all patients with pleural thickening greater than 3 mm. Pleural biopsy was performed with a 14G gauge automatic needle (Acecut. TSK). Biopsy was completely echo-guided. Result(s):The samples were tagged as adequate sample (AS) or non-adequate sample (NAS) depending on the presence of mesothelium evidenced by the pathologist. Adequate samples (AS) were also tagged as diagnostic samples (DAS) or non-diagnostic samples (NDAS). We enrolled 32 patients. 68.8% were males, mean age of 53 (ED: 31). Biopsy was performed without need of hospitalization in 50 % of the cases. We obtained 26 AS (84.4%). 96.4% of them were diagnostic (DAS). Only one case showed further evidence of pleural involvement in a negative biopsy (mediastinal pleura).

Purpose: To improve local disease control and survival with organ preservation, we conducted a phase II multi-institutional trial with a concomitant taxane-based chemotherapy and hyperfractionated radiation regimen. Patients and Methods: Sixty-four patients with locally advanced squamous cancers (stage IV, 98%; N2/3, 81%) were treated on an intensive regimen consisting of 5-day (120-hour) infusions of paclitaxel (20 mg/m2/d) and fluorouracil (600 mg/m2/d), oral hydroxyurea 500 mg every 12 hours for 11 doses, and radiation 1.5 Gy bid (T-FH2X). Chemoradiation was administered concomitantly on days 1 to 5 of each 14-day cycle. A full treatment course consisted of five cycles during a 10-week period to a total radiation dose of 72 to 75 Gy. Result(s): The median follow-up for the group is 34 months. At 3 years, progression-free survival is 63%, locoregional control is 86%, and systemic control is 79%; overall survival is 60%. Seventeen patients died of recurrent cancer, two died of second primary cancers, and four died of other causes. Side effects observed include anemia (22% required transfusion), leucopenia (34%, grade 3 to 4), and mucositis (84%, grade 3 to 4). Organ preservation principles were maintained. At 1 year posttreatment, 61% of patients had severe xerostomia and 47% had compromised swallowing. There was little disturbance of speech quality in 97% of patients at the same follow-up point. Conclusion(s): T-FH2X is a highly active and tolerable concomitant chemotherapy and hyperfractionated radiation regimen that induces sustained local tumor control and holds promise for improved survival with organ preservation in high-risk patients. Identification of less toxic therapy and improved distant disease control are needed. T-FH2X should be tested in a randomized trial and compared with a less intensive concomitant regimen that uses once-daily radiation fractionation. © 2001 by American Society of Clinical Oncology.",Excluded

OBJECTIVE: To assess the outcome of patients who are undergoing reconstruction of segmental lateral mandibular defects by using soft-tissue free flaps combined with mandibular reconstruction plates., DESIGN: Retrospective case series of 15 patients who were undergoing primary reconstruction of mandibular segments posterior to the mental foramen, resulting from treatment of head and neck cancer. All patients received either preoperative or postoperative radiation therapy., SETTING: Academic tertiary care referral center., INTERVENTIONS: Fourteen patients had mandibular continuity restored by using the titanium hollow screw reconstruction plate system, and 1 patient received a stainless steel mandibular reconstruction plate. Associated soft-tissue defects were repaired by using radial forearm (n = 11), rectus abdominis (n = 2), scapular and parascapular (n = 1), or lateral arm (n = 1) free flaps., MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Early and delayed complications., RESULTS: All 15 microvascular free tissue transfers were successful. Early complications were minor and occurred in 5 (33%) of 15 patients. One patient in whom the titanium hollow screw reconstruction plate system had been used experienced a fracture at 15 months after reconstruction. Three patients experienced delayed external plate exposure between 7 and 15 months after primary oromandibular reconstruction.

Purpose: The value of intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) for early-stage nasal NK/T-cell lymphoma has not been previously reported. The aim of the present study was to assess the dosimetric parameters, toxicity, and treatment outcomes of patients with nasal NK/T-cell lymphoma. Methods and Materials: Between 2003 and 2008, 42 patients with early-stage nasal NK/T-cell lymphoma underwent definitive high-dose and extended involved-field IMRT with or without combination chemotherapy. The median radiation dose to the primary tumor was 50 Gy. The dose-volume histograms of the target volume and critical normal structures were evaluated in all patients. The locoregional control, overall survival, and progression-free survival were calculated using the Kaplan-Meier method. Result(s): The average mean dose delivered to the planning target volume was 55.5 Gy. Only 1.3% and 2.5% of the planning target volume received <90% and 95% of the prescribed dose, respectively, indicating excellent planning target volume coverage. The mean dose and average dose to the parotid glands was 15 Gy and 14 Gy, respectively.

This study is to investigate the adverse health effects in MRI workers and also to assess the effect of exposure of MRI workers to static magnetic fields on their cognitive functions. In the first phase of this study a questionnaire was designed to collect information from 120 MRI personnel. The collection of data about the adverse health effects was based on self-reporting by the participants. In the second phase, 47 volunteer university students were asked to continuously move around a 1.5 T MRI scanner. Visual reaction time and working memory tests were performed on all participants before and after the experiment. Forward digit span and backward digit span were used for assessing the working memory. Furthermore, participants were asked to report the symptoms they had experienced during the movement. The first phase of our study showed increased frequencies of adverse health effects in MRI workers. In this study the rates of self-reported symptoms such as a headache, sleep problems, myalgia, palpitation, fatigue, concentration problems, attention problems, nervousness and backpain were possibly affected by static magnetic field. Furthermore we found that reaction time and working memory could be influenced by the movements of the body around a MRI scanner. It can be concluded that movement through a high magnetic field can also lead to some adverse cognitive effects in MRI staff.Copyright © 2018, Shiraz University of Medical Sciences.

1385,"Real-time cerebral angiography: Sensitivity of a new contrast-specific ultrasound technique. BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: To test a new contrast-specific sonography imaging method that offers visualization of the intracranial vasculature in a manner similar to that seen on angiography. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Thirty patients (35 sonography studies total) were included in the study after they provided written informed consent. The patients were scanned through the temporal bone window from both sides after intravenous injection of an ultrasound contrast agent (UCA; perflexane lipid microspheres [Imagent]). The goal was to visualize the intracranial arteries, including the middle (M1-M3), anterior (A1 and A2), and posterior (P1-P3) cerebral arteries, using an axial scanning plane. The studies were performed using a contrast-specific imaging mode, based on a phase inversion technique (transcranial ultrasound angiography [tUSA]). For sensitivity, the results were compared with x-ray angiography as the ""gold standard."" For interobserver reliability, 24 of 35 sonography studies were evaluated by 2 physicians with little training in transcranial sonography and by a seasoned sonographer. RESULT(S): The sensitivity of tUSA ranged between 0.778 (95% confidence interval [CI] of 0.577-0.914) and 0.963 (95% CI of 0.810-0.999). The sensitivities were similar among physicians with little training in transcranial sonography and the seasoned sonographer, indicating high inter-rater reliability. Overall, tUSA provided high anatomic resolution and vascular delineation even of small vessels in the millimeter range. At peak intensity, no UCA-related artifacts were observed. CONCLUSION(S): tUSA provides images of the intracranial arteries similar to those obtained at angiography with high anatomic resolution, reasonable sensitivity, and interobserver reliability.",Excluded
3428,"Late complications after high-dose-rate interstitial brachytherapy for tongue cancer. Objectives. To analyze the treatment results and late complications of high-dose-rate (HDR) interstitial brachytherapy (ISBT) for early (T1N0, T2N0) mobile tongue cancer using the microSelectron-HDR. Methods. From January 1993 through April 2001, a total of 72 patients with early squamous cell carcinomas of the mobile tongue were treated with microSelectron-HDR interstitial brachytherapy at the Department of Radiology, Osaka University Hospital. Of the patients, 18% were treated with a combination of prior external radiation and HDR-ISBT, and 82% were treated with HDR-ISBT alone. For HDR-ISBT alone, all cases were treated with a total dose of 54 Gy/9 fractions every 5 days or 60 Gy/10 fractions every 8 days. In combined therapy with an external dose of 30 to 40 Gy, HDR-ISBT was given at a total dose of 42-50 Gy. The Brinkman and alcohol indexes were used to analyze the incidence of late complications after HDR-ISBT. Results. The 2- and 5-year local control rates were 85% and 82%, respectively. Fifteen of 72 patients (21%) treated with HDR-ISBT had late complications. Ten of 15 patients (67%) with late complications had a Brinkman index exceeding 600. Conclusions. HDR-ISBT is useful and easily applied under local anesthesia to early or superficial lesions of the mobile tongue. However, we found an increase in late complications, such as soft-tissue ulcers and bone exposure, after irradiation of tongue cancer with 60 Gy HDR-ISBT in patients with a Brinkman index greater than 600. © Japanese Society for Oral and Maxillofacial Radiology Springer-Verlag Tokyo 2005.",Excluded
2786,"The diagnostic accuracy, image quality and radiation dose of 64-slice dual-source CT in daily practice: a single institution's experience. OBJECTIVE: We wanted to evaluate the image quality, diagnostic accuracy and radiation exposure of 64-slice dual-source CT (DSCT) coronary angiography according to the heart rate in symptomatic patients during daily clinical practice., MATERIALS AND METHODS: We performed a retrospective search for the DSCT coronary angiography reports of 729 consecutive symptomatic patients. For the 131 patients who underwent invasive coronary angiography, the image quality, the diagnostic performance (sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value [PPV] and negative predictive value [NPV] for detecting significant stenosis >= 50% diameter) and the radiation exposure were evaluated. These values were compared between the groups with differing heart rates (HR): mean HR < 65 or >= 65 and HR variability (HRV) < 15 or >= 15., RESULTS: Among the 729 patients, the CT reports showed no stenosis or insignificant coronary artery stenosis in 72%, significant stenosis in 26% and non-diagnostic in 2%. For the 131 patients who underwent invasive coronary angiography, 95% of the patients and 97% of the segments were evaluable, and the overall per-patient/per-segment sensitivity, the perpatient/per-segment specificity, the per-patient/per-segment PPV and the per-patient/per-segment NPV were 100%/90%, 71%/98%, 95%/88% and 100%/97%, respectively. The image quality was better in the HR < 65 group than in the HR >= 65 group (p = 0.001), but there was no difference in diagnostic performance between the two groups. The mean effective radiation doses were lower in the HR < 65 or HRV < 15 group (p < 0.0001): 5.5 versus 6.7 mSv for the mean HR groups and 5.3 versus 9.3 mSv for the HRV groups., CONCLUSION: Dual-source CT coronary angiography is a highly accurate modality in the clinical setting. Better image quality and a significant radiation reduction are being rendered in the lower HR group.",Excluded

3318,"Use of digital auscultation in patients with ARDS: a correlation study with CT imaging. Despite being the gold standard for evaluation of lung parenchyma in ARDS patients, chest CT scan may be complicated by requiring patient transportation out of the ICU and is burdened by high costs and significant radiation exposure. We aimed to correlate acoustic features from digital chest auscultation with CT findings to explore the potential role of quantitative lung sound analysis as surrogate of imaging in these patients. We enrolled 4 male and 2 female patients (age: 63y+/-21 ; BMI: 25,7+/-4,4) admitted to ICU for ARDS-related severe respiratory failure (SRF) who underwent chest CT scan while receiving controlled invasive mechanical ventilation. A thoracic radiologist scored twelve lung regions for the prevalent CT pattern - normal, interstitial thickening, ground glass opacity or consolidation - and for the presence of pleural effusion. Digital auscultation was performed within 24 hours from CT scan at corresponding regions. Average frequency of the acoustic signal was higher in lung regions with consolidation (n=32) as compared to those with other patterns (n=38) (difference -2.25 Htz, 95%CI -4-42; -0.7, p=0.043). Increasing signal frequency was significantly associated with evidence of consolidation on CT (OR 1.117, 95%CI 1.00-1.247, p=0.048). Digital auscultation and quantitative lung sound analysis may help assess alveolar ventilation in patients with SRF in a simple, non-invasive way. Further investigation in larger populations is warranted to assess the validity of acoustic features against quantitative CT imaging.",Excluded
3391,"Radiation exposure from computed tomography in blunt trauma patients. Methods. Using data from our hospital information system, we selected patients assigned a trauma code, according to the Korean Standard Classification of Diseases, and with three or more body lesions assessed by CT at the same time in the emergency department. Each CT conducted was categorized into 'CT related to the final diagnosis' or 'CT unrelated to final diagnosis'. The characteristics and estimated effective dose of CTs unrelated to the final diagnosis were analyzed. The factors affecting the estimated effective dose of CTs unrelated to final diagnosis were investigated., Results. More than half of all CT examinations were not associated with the final diagnosis. The additional estimated effective dose due to CTs being unrelated to the final diagnosis in each patient was a sufficient amount of radiation exposure to increase the possibility of fatal cancer., Introduction. Computed tomography (CT) has many diagnostic advantages, spurring growth in the number of CT examinations. As the use of CT increases, the potential for radiation-induced adverse effects has become an issue. The primary objective of this study was to assess the liberal use of CT induced radiation exposure in patients with multiple blunt traumas. The secondary objective was to investigate the factors affecting the estimated effective dose resulting from CTs unrelated to final diagnosis., Conclusion. A considerable number of CT scans were unrelated to the patient's final diagnosis, which exposes the patient to additional radiation exposure.Copyright ©, Pharmamed Mado Ltd.

1960,"Adjuvant versus neoadjuvant radiochemotherapy for locally advanced rectal cancer. Aim: The standard treatment for patients with clinically resectable rectal cancer is surgery. Postoperative radiochemotherapy is recommended for patients with advanced disease (pT3/4 or pN+). In recent years, encouraging results of preoperative radiotherapy have been reported. This prospective randomized phase-III trial (CAO/ARO/AIO-94) compares the efficacy of neoadjuvant radiochemotherapy to standard postoperative radiochemotherapy. We report on the design of the study and first results with regard to toxicity of radiochemotherapy and postoperative morbidity. Patients and Methods: Patients with locally advanced operable rectal cancer (uT3/4 or uN+, Mason CS III/IV) were randomly assigned to pre- or postoperative radiochemotherapy: A total dose of 50.4 Gy (single dose 1.8 Gy) was applied to the tumor and the pelvic lymph nodes. 5-FU (1,000 mg/m2/d) was administered concomitantly in the first and fifth week of radiation as 120-h continuous infusion. Four additional cycles of 5-FU chemotherapy (500 mg/m2/d, iv bolus) were applied. Radiochemotherapy was identical in both arms except for a small-volume boost of 5.4 Gy in the postoperative setting. Time interval between radiochemotherapy and surgery was 4-6 weeks in both arms. Techniques of surgery were standardized and included total mesorectal excision. In addition, stratification according to surgeons involved has been provided for. Primary endpoints of the study are 5-year overall-survival, local and distant control, secondary endpoints include rate of curative (R0) resections and sphincter saving procedures, toxicity of radiochemotherapy, surgical complications and quality of life. Result(s): As of 15th November 2000, 628 patients were randomized from 26 participating institutions: 310 patients were randomized to postoperative radiochemotherapy, 318 patients to preoperative radiochemotherapy. Acute toxicity (WHO) of radiochemotherapy was low, with less than 15% of patients experiencing Grade 3 or higher toxicity: The principal toxicity was diarrhea, with 12% in the postoperative radiochemotherapy arm and 10% in the preoperative radiochemotherapy arm having Grade-3, and 1% in either arm having Grade-4 diarrhea. Erythema, nausea and leukopenia were the next common toxicities, with less than 3% of patients in either arm suffering Grade 3 or greater leukopenia or nausea. Postoperative complication rates were similar in both arms, with 12% (postoperative radiochemotherapy) and 13% (preoperative radiochemotherapy) of patients, respectively, suffering from anastomotic leakage, 4% (postoperative radiochemotherapy) and 3% (preoperative radiochemotherapy) from postoperative bleeding, and 6% (postoperative radiochemotherapy) and 5% (preoperative radiochemotherapy) from delayed wound healing. Conclusion(s): The patient accrual of our trial is satisfactory, neoadjuvant radiochemotherapy is well tolerated and bears no higher risk for postoperative morbidity.",Excluded
929,"Prognostic factors and treatment outcomes of 100 cases of anaplastic thyroid carcinoma. Background: Anaplastic thyroid carcinoma (ATC) is a malignancy with one of the highest fatality rates. Here we report a retrospective study of the treatment and other factors associated with its outcomes. Material(s) and Method(s): The medical records of 100 patients diagnosed with ATC at Ito Hospital between 1993 and 2009 were reviewed and pertinent information was extracted and analyzed. Result(s): There were 80 women and 20 men, and their median age at diagnosis was 68 years (range, 41-90 years). Thirteen patients had a history of well-differentiated thyroid carcinoma. Six patients had a small ATC focus within a differentiated carcinoma. All cases were retrospectively staged according to the Union for International Cancer Control classification system, and the results were stage IVA in 11 cases, stage IVB in 31 cases, and stage IVC in 58 cases. Seventy patients underwent surgical treatment, and complete resection was performed in 24 of them. Seventy-eight patients received radiotherapy, and 58 of them received a total dose of >=40 Gy. Twenty-seven patients received chemotherapy. Only 15 patients received multimodal therapy (surgery, radiotherapy, and chemotherapy). The 1-year survival rates according to stage were as follows: stage IVA, 72.7%; stage IVB, 24.8%; and stage IVC, 8.2%. Multivariate analysis identified age >=70 years, white blood cell >=10,000 mm3, extrathyroidal invasion, and distant metastasis at the time of diagnosis as prognostic factors. Survival after complete resection was significantly better than after incomplete resection or no resection. The results also suggested that radiation doses of >=40 Gy were associated with significantly longer survival. Conclusion(s): Although the prognosis of most patients with ATC continues to be poor, surgery, radiotherapy, and a combination of both improved the survival of patients with ATC. © 2011, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.",Excluded
2455,"Outcome Prediction After Surgery and Chemoradiation of Squamous Cell Carcinoma in the Oral Cavity, Oropharynx, and Hypopharynx: Use of Baseline Perfusion CT Microcirculatory Parameters vs. Tumor Volume. Purpose: To assess whether pretreatment perfusion computed tomography (PCT) may predict outcome in chemoradiated patients with oral cavity, oropharynx, and hypopharynx squamous cell carcinoma (SCCA) after surgical excision. Material(s) and Method(s): Twenty-one patients with SCCA were examined before treatment. The primary site was oral cavity in 6, oropharynx in 7, and hypopharynx in 8 patients; there were 11 T2, 6 T3, and 4 T4 tumors. PCT was performed at the level of largest tumor diameter based on standard neck CT. The data were processed to obtain blood flow (BF), blood volume (BV), mean transit time (MTT), and permeability surface area product (PS). Regions of interest were free-hand positioned on the lesions to obtain PCT measurements. Tumor volume was also calculated. Follow-up was performed with positron emission tomography (PET)/CT and endoscopy. Pearson correlation coefficient was used for comparison between the subgroups. A regression model was constructed to predict recurrence based on the following predictors: age, gender, tumor (T) and nodal (N) stage, tumor volume, and PCT parameters. Result(s): BFmean, BFmax, BVmean, BVmax, MTTmean, PSmean, and PSmax were significantly different between patients with and without tumor recurrence (0.0001, p < 0.04). T stage, tumor volume, N stage, BFmax, BVmax, MTTmean, and radiation dose (p < 0.001) were independent predictors for recurrence. Cox proportional hazards model for tumor recurrence revealed significantly increased risk with high tumor volume (p = 0.00001, relative risk [RR] 7.4), low PSmean (p = 0.0001, RR 14.3), and low BFmax (p = 0.002, RR 5.9).

187,"XPA-deficiency in hairless mice causes a shift in skin tumor types and mutational target genes after exposure to low doses of U.V.B. Xeroderma pigmentosum (XP) patients with a defect in the nucleotide excision repair gene XPA, develop tumors with a high frequency on sun-exposed areas of the skin. Here we describe that hairless XPA-deficient mice also develop skin tumors with a short latency time and a 100% prevalence after daily exposure to low doses of U.V.B. Surprisingly and in contrast to U.V.B.-exposed repair proficient hairless mice who mainly develop squamous cell carcinomas, the XPA-deficient mice developed papillomas with a high frequency (31%) at a U.V. dose of 32 J/m2 daily. At the highest daily dose of 80 J/m2 mainly squamous cell carcinomas (56%) and only 10% of papillomas were found in XPA-deficient hairless mice. p53 gene mutations were examined in exons 5, 7 and 8 and were detected in only 3 out of 37 of these skin tumors, whereas in tumors of control U.V.B.-irradiated wild type littermates this frequency was higher (45%) and more in line with our previous data. Strikingly, a high incidence of activating ras gene mutations were observed in U.V.B.-induced papillomas (in 11 out of 14 tumors analysed). In only two out of 14 squamous cell carcinomas we found similar ras gene mutations. The observed shift from squamous cell carcinomas in wild type hairless mice to papillomas in XPA-deficient hairless mice, and a corresponding shift in mutated cancer genes in these tumors, provide new clues on the pathogenesis of chemically- versus U.V.B.-induced skin carcinogenesis.",Excluded
2012,"Synergic stimulation of the greater occipital nerve (GON) and sphenopalatine ganglion (SPG) for the control of cluster headaches (CH). Introduction: CH is a form of primary unilateral headache that features repeated attacks of excruciating severe pain. Frequently unresponsive to medical management, it has attracted the interest for its resolution by means of ablative surgical techniques and neuromodulation. We present two patients suff ering from CH refractory to conservative treatment, who were subjected to chronic synergic stimulation of the occipital nerve and SPG with a three year follow up. Material(s) and Method(s): Two patients suff ering from CH, a 48 y/o female, and a 23 y/o male, both refractory to medical treatment, underwent surgery on February and March, 2008, respectively. In both cases we proceeded to the simultaneous implantation of SPG and greater occipital nerve stimulators. They were followed up using the VAS, HDRS, HARS, and SF-36 questionnaire, previous to the procedure, 3, 6, 9 and 12 months after the procedure, and subsequently every 6 months. The stimulation schedule was as follows: four months of SPG stimulation, four months of GON stimulation, and simultaneous stimulation. Result(s): The first patient experienced and excellent initial pain relief, presenting a sudden loss of stimulation of the facial area 12 days after surgery, noting electrode displacement from the SPG in control X-ray (picture 1), which required its relocation, with the subsequent regaining of the initial benefit. Both patients obtained the greatest response (in terms of pain relief) during the simultaneous stimulation of SPG and GON, which was superior to that one obtained with the independent stimulation of each structure. The female patient obtained a complete control with total disappearance of the crisis. Surprisingly, 15 month after the intervention she did not required utilizing the stimulation, situation that remains unchanged to date. The male patient obtained a pain reduction of 86% during the first three months of synergic stimulation according to the VAS, but he remained at 66% pain reduction thereafter. Also, the number of crisis decreased in a significant manner. Discussion(s): Multiple percutaneous techniques have been proposed to control CH symptoms, including the utilization of radiofrequency on the Gasser ganglion, GON and SPG, among other structures (1). With the advent of neuromodulation, deep hypothalamic stimulation demonstrated a high efficacy in the treatment of this condition (2), even though with some risks inherent to the procedure, including death. Conclusion(s): Synergic stimulation of the greater occipital nerve and SPG has demonstrated greater effectiveness in the control of the frequency and magnitude of painful crisis of CH in relation to single stimulation of each one of these structures. We believe this is a useful therapeutic strategy before considering deep hypothalamic stimulation due to its greater frequency of complications.",Excluded

Purpose: To assess the usefulness of simple axial bi-dimensional diameters of pericardial fat tissues at low-dose chest CT, in correlation with metabolic parameters in predicting metabolic syndrome. Material(s) and Method(s): Subjects were 373 asymptomatic individuals who performed both low-dose chest CT and abdominal fat CT for medical check-up. Maximum bi-dimensional axial diameters of paracardial fats at right (RPF) and left (LPF) cardiophrenic angle portions, and epicardial fats around right (REF) and left (LEF) coronary arteries, and coronary sinus (SEF) were measured. Correlation between pericardial fat diameters and metabolic parameters were statistically analyzed. Result(s): RPF, LPF, REF, LEF, and SEF diameters were moderately correlated with abdominal visceral fat (AVF) area (R = 0.74, 0.70, 0.48, 0.41, and 0.53, respectively, p < 0.01) in Pearson's correlation analysis. In multiple linear regression analysis, coefficient of RPF for AVF showed highest value. Means of each PF and EF diameters in subjects with metabolic syndrome were significantly larger than those without metabolic syndrome (p < 0.001). All PF and EF diameters were well-discriminated for prediction of metabolic syndrome in ROC analysis (AUC values, from 0.696 to 0.795).

BACKGROUND: Stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) of the spine provides superior tumor control, but vertebral compression fractures are increased and the pathophysiological process underneath is not well understood. Data on histopathological changes, particularly after salvage SBRT (sSBRT) following conventional irradiation, are scarce., OBJECTIVE: To investigate surgical specimens after sSBRT and primary SBRT (pSBRT) regarding histopathological changes., METHODS: We assessed 704 patients treated with spine SBRT 2006 to 2012. Thirty patients underwent salvage surgery; 23 histopathological reports were available. Clinical and histopathological findings were analyzed for sSBRT (69.6%) and pSBRT (30.4%)., RESULTS: Mean time to surgery after sSBRT/pSBRT was 8.3/10.3 mo (P = .64). Reason for surgery included pain (sSBRT/pSBRT: 12.5%/71.4%, P = .25), fractures (sSBRT/pSBRT: 37.5%/28.6%, P = .68), and neurological symptoms (sSBRT/pSBRT: 68.8%/42.9%, P = .24). Radiological tumor progression after sSBRT/pSBRT was seen in 71.4%/42.9% (P = .2). Most specimens displayed viable/proliferative tumor (sSBRT/pSBRT: 62.5%/71.4%, P = .68 and 56.3%/57.1%, P = .97). Few specimens showed soft tissue necrosis (sSBRT/pSBRT: 20%/28.6%, P = .66), osteonecrosis (sSBRT/pSBRT: 14.3%/16.7%, P = .89), or bone marrow fibrosis (sSBRT/pSBRT: 42.9%/33.3%, P = .69). Tumor bed necrosis was more common after sSBRT (81.3%/42.9%, P = .066). Radiological tumor progression correlated with viable/proliferative tumor (P = .03/P = .006) and tumor bed necrosis (P = .03). Fractures were increased with bone marrow fibrosis (P = .07), but not with osteonecrosis (P = .53) or soft tissue necrosis (P = .19). Neurological symptoms were common with radiological tumor progression (P = .07), but not with fractures (P = .18)., CONCLUSION: For both, sSBRT and pSBRT, histopathological changes were similar. Neurological symptoms were attributable to tumor progression and pathological fractures were not associated with osteonecrosis or tumor progression.",Excluded

UNLABELLED: The study aim was to assess the safety, biodistribution, tissue kinetics, and tumor uptake of the (99m)Tc-labeled neurotensin (NT) analog NT-XI., METHODS: Four patients presenting ductal pancreatic adenocarcinoma were studied with (99m)Tc-NT-XI. Patients were followed by scintigraphy up to 4 h and by continued blood and urinary sampling until surgery 18-22 h after injection. Surgical tissue samples were analyzed for radioactivity uptake and NT receptor expression., RESULTS: No side effects were observed on injection of (99m)Tc-NT-XI. Blood biologic half-lives alpha and beta were 35 min (range, 17-62 min) and 230 min (range, 107-383 min), respectively. Repeated whole-body scintigraphy performed in 2 patients showed a single exponential decrease of whole-body activity with half-lives of 101 and 232 min. Tracer elimination was mainly renal, with 92% and 98% of activity counted in urine in the first 20 h. Kidney, liver, spleen, and bone marrow activity uptake was observed in all patients. Tumor was not visualized in the first 3 patients but could be localized by tomoscintigraphy in the pancreas head region of patient 4. In vitro tissue analysis showed high expression of NT receptor in the tumor of patient 4, correlated with the highest tumor radioactivity uptake and the highest tumor-to-fat radioactivity ratio. In vitro receptor expression was also positive in a second patient having a tumor characterized by very low cellularity; however, the remaining 2 tumors lacked NT receptor expression., CONCLUSION: Injection of (99m)Tc-NT-XI was well tolerated. The in vivo tumor uptake appeared specific as it was observed in the 1 patient with a pancreatic tumor that expressed high amounts of NT receptor. The results are compatible with preclinical animal results and in favor of further development of radiolabeled NT analogs for diagnosis or therapy of cancer.",Excluded
3161,"Hyperparathyroidism after thyroid surgery and autotransplantation of histologically normal parathyroid glands. BACKGROUND: Parathyroid autotransplantation is a well-established method to prevent hypoparathyroidism during parathyroid and thyroid operations. The reported success rate of parathyroid autotransplantation ranges from 75% to 100%. Recurrent hyperparathyroidism may develop after parathyroid autotransplantation, especially after the transplantation of hyperplastic or adenomatous parathyroid tissue. Hyperparathyroidism recurs most frequently after subtotal parathyroidectomy or total parathyroidectomy and autotransplantation, in patients with renal failure and secondary hyperparathyroidism, and in patients with familial primary hyperparathyroidism or MEN I or MEN II syndrome. We report three patients who experienced primary hyperparathyroidism after autotransplantation of normal parathyroid tissue during thyroid operations (two patients) or after a long period of hypoparathyroidism., STUDY DESIGN: We reviewed our records from 1983 to May 1998 and identified three patients in whom hyperparathyroidism developed after thyroid operations., RESULTS: One patient had a thyroidectomy with left modified radical neck dissection for papillary thyroid cancer, followed by radioiodine ablative therapy. Two patients had thyroid operations for benign thyroid disease. One of these patients had a history of radiation exposure for acne, and in the other one secondary hyperparathyroidism arose 6 years after a thyroidectomy for hyperthyroidism., CONCLUSIONS: Our study documents that hyperparathyroidism may develop after autotransplantation of histologically normal parathyroid tissue and after a period of hypoparathyroidism after thyroid operations. For this reason, it is important to mark the site of the parathyroid transplantation.",Excluded

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effectiveness of a virtual CT-guided navigation system (Sirio-MASMEC Biomed) in performing lung biopsies, with greater attention to lesions smaller than 1 cm, compared to the traditional procedure., METHODS: This study was approved by the Ethics Committee of our Institute. Two hundred patients were prospectively selected. Of these, 100 were subjected to percutaneous procedure with the use of Sirio and 100 to traditional CT-guided percutaneous procedure. The two methods were compared in terms of absorbed dose, procedure time, complications, and number of non-diagnostic specimens (diagnostic success)., RESULTS: Sirio has shown a significant reduction in the absorbed dose and procedure times (p < 0.05), with a lower incidence of complications compared to the traditional procedure. Sirio has also allowed to carry out biopsies of lesions' diameter <=10 mm, obtaining fewer non diagnostic specimens thus resulting more effective in terms of diagnostic success., CONCLUSIONS: The use of Sirio in sampling biopsy showed a statistically significant reduction in terms of performed scans and procedural time with lower incidence of post-procedural complications compared to the traditional percutaneous procedure, especially for lesions <=10 mm. The best diagnostic result, the reduction of the dose absorbed and procedural complications makes the procedures more reliable, safety and less invasive. In addition, the reduction of execution time will increase the number of daily interventional procedures improving clinical management.",Excluded
2103,"Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography and laparoscopic cholecystectomy during the same session: Feasibility and safety. Aim: To explore the feasibility and safety of endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography and laparoscopic cholecystectomy (LC) performed during the same session. Method(s): Between July 2010 and May 2013, 156 patients with gallstones and common bile duct (CBD) stones were enrolled in this retrospective study. According to the sequence of endoscopic procedures and LC, patients were classified into two groups: in group 1, patients underwent endoscopic stone extraction and LC during the same session, and in group 2, patients underwent LC at least 3 d after endoscopic stone extraction. Outcomes of the endoscopic procedures and LC were compared between the two groups, respectively. Result(s): There were 91 patients in group 1 and 65 patients in group 2. The characteristics of the two groups were similar. The mean duration of the endoscopic procedures was 34.9 min in group 1 and 35.3 min in group 2. There were no significant differences in the success rate of the endoscopic procedures (97.8% for group 1 vs 98.5% for group 2), the total rate of endoscopic complications (4.40% for group 1 vs 4.62% for group 2) and CBD stone clearance rate (96.7% for group 1 vs 96.9% for group 2). Duration of LC was 53.6 min in group 1 and 52.8 min in group 2. There were no significant differences in the overall LC-related morbidity and postoperative hospital stay. Conclusion(s): Endoscopic stone extraction and LC performed during the same session was feasible and safe in patients with gallstones and concomitant CBD stones. © 2013 Baishideng.

16,"Prognostic Factors Predict Oncological Outcome in Older Patients With Head and Neck Cancer Undergoing Chemoradiation Treatment. Purpose: Older patients with head and neck cancer (HNC) represent a challenging group, as frailty and comorbidities need to be considered. This study aimed to evaluate the efficacy and side effects of curative and palliative (chemo) radiation ([C]RT) with regard to basic geriatric screening in older patients. Method(s): This study included HNC patients aged >=70 years who were treated with curative or palliative (C)RT. Clinicopathological data including Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI), Karnofsky performance status (KPS), and treatment data were analyzed as predictors of overall survival (OS). Result(s): A total of 271 patients (median age, 74 years) were enrolled. The majority had UICC stage III/IV (90%) and underwent curative treatment (85.2%). A total of 144 (53.1%) patients received definitive and 87 (32.1%) had adjuvant (C)RT. Overall, 40 patients (14.8%) received palliative (C)RT. Median follow-up duration (curative setting) was 87 months, and the 2- and 5-year OS rates were 57.8 and 35.9%, respectively. Median OS was significantly different for age <=75 vs. >75 years, CCI <6 vs. >=6, KPS >=70 vs. <70%, Tx/T1/T2 vs. T3/T4, and adjuvant vs. definitive (C)RT, respectively. Age 70-75 years (p = 0.004), fewer comorbidities when CCI < 6 (p = 0.014), good KPS >= 70% (p = 0.001), and adjuvant (C)RT (p = 0.008) independently predicted longer survival. Palliative RT resulted in a median OS of 4 months. Conclusion(s): Older age, lower KPS, higher CCI, and definitive (C)RT are indicators of worse survival in older patients with HNC treated curatively. Without a comprehensive geriatric assessment in patients aged >75 years, the KPS and CCI can be useful tools to account for ""fitness, vulnerability or frailty"" to help in treatment decision-making.© Copyright © 2021 Stromberger, Yedikat, Coordes, Tinhofer, Kalinauskaite, Budach, Zschaeck, Raguse, Kofla, Heiland, Stsefanenka, Beck-Broichsitter, Dommerich, Senger and Beck.",Excluded
2087,"Can low-dose unenhanced chest CT be used for follow-up of lung nodules?. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study is to establish the difference in lung nodule volume between standard-dose contrast-enhanced and low-dose unenhanced CT., SUBJECTS AND METHODS: Twenty patients with known pulmonary metastases underwent three CT examinations on 1 day: two unenhanced low-dose (120 kVp and 30 mAs) and a standard-dose (120-140 kVp and 75-200 mAs) contrast-enhanced chest CT examinations. For nodules<1000 mm3, nodule volume was quantified using dedicated software from the CT manufacturer. Wilcoxon's signed rank tests were used for analysis of nodules<=200 mm3 and >200 mm3 (approximately diameter of 8 mm)., RESULTS: One hundred one nodules (n=69<=200 mm3) were analyzed in 15 of these subjects. Measured volume of nodules<=200 mm3 was systematically lower on both low-dose unenhanced CT examinations when compared with standard-dose contrast-enhanced CT (differences, 13.7% and 15.5%, respectively; p<0.0001), but nodule volume was not different between low-dose CT (median difference, 1.0%; p=0.10). Nodule volume was not systematically different between the protocols for nodules>200 mm3 (p>0.30)., CONCLUSION: For lung nodules<=200 mm3 (approximately 8 mm) the measured volume on low-dose unenhanced CT is significantly lower when compared with standard-dose contrast-enhanced CT. This effect is likely due to contrast administration rather than other imaging parameters, which should be taken into account in the follow-up of lung nodules because growth can remain undetected or doubling time underestimated.",Excluded
2203,"Frameless Stereotactic Radiosurgery for Treatment of Multiple Sclerosis-Related Trigeminal Neuralgia. Background Trigeminal neuralgia (TN) affects 7% of patients with multiple sclerosis (MS). In such patients, TN is difficult to manage either pharmacologically and surgically. Radiosurgical rhizotomy is an effective treatment option. The nonisocentric geometry of radiation beams of CyberKnife introduces new concepts in the treatment of TN. Its efficacy for MS-related TN has not yet been demonstrated. Methods Twenty-seven patients with refractory TN and MS were treated. A nonisocentric beams distribution was chosen; the maximal target dose was 72.5 Gy. The maximal dose to the brainstem was <12 Gy. Effects on pain, medications, sensory disturbance, rate, and time of pain recurrence were analyzed. Results Median follow-up was 37 (18-72) months. Barrow Neurological Institute pain scale score I-III was achieved in 23/27 patients (85%) within 45 days. Prescription isodose line (80%) accounting for a dose of 58 Gy incorporated an average of 4.85 mm (4-6 mm) of the nerve and mean nerve volume of 26.4 mm3 (range 20-38 mm3). Seven out of 27 patients (26%) had mild, not bothersome, facial numbness (Barrow Neurological Institute numbness score II). The rate of pain control decreased progressively after the first year, and only 44% of patients retained pain control 4 years later. Conclusions Frameless radiosurgery can be effectively used to perform retrogasserian rhizotomy. Pain relief was satisfactory and, with our dose/volume constraints, no sensory complications were recorded. Nonetheless, long-term pain control was possible in less than half of the patients. This is a limitation that CyberKnife radiosurgery shares with other techniques in MS patients.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Inc.",Excluded
1622,"The usefulness of radiation therapy for hepatocellular carcinoma. BACKGROUND/AIMS: The usefulness of radiation therapy (RT) for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is still controversial. To clarify whether RT has its role in the management of HCC as a single modality or in combination with other modalities, we analyzed the clinical features of the patients treated with RT retrospectively. METHODOLOGY: Twenty-two patients who underwent RT for intrahepatic lesions with total dose ranging from 58 to 68 Gy were studied. Regression rate for 21 of the irradiated lesions was calculated using the computed tomographic scans. RESULTS. After the size of the irradiated intrahepatic tumor initially decreased, it remained unchanged for a long period. Tumor size at the latest follow-up never exceeded pre-RT tumor size except in one patient who was treated by RT only. In 3 of 20 cancer deaths, the irradiated tumors were the direct cause of death. CONCLUSION(S): Local RT for HCC at potentially curative dose can be performed safely in patients with preserved liver function even if they have already been treated with other therapies. Radiation therapy has a role in strengthening the therapeutic efficacy when combined with other therapy.",Excluded

2958,"Toxoplasma gondii: effect of sublethal irradiation on host resistance in mice. The effect of sublethal whole-body irradiation (500 rad) on the resistance of C57BL/6 mice to infection with Toxoplasma gondii was studied. Mice irradiated 1 day before or 4 days after infection via the intraperitoneal or peroral route with cysts of the mildly virulent ME49 strain of T. gondii died sooner than did unirradiated controls. The time to death of irradiated mice was suggestive of impaired acquired immunity. Irradiated mice infected intraperitoneally with T. gondii cysts exhibited reduced levels of Thy-1+CD4-CD8- cells, less natural killer cell activity against YAC-1 targets, and lower levels of IFN-gamma than controls. Numbers of CD4+ and CD8+ cells were also lower in infected, irradiated mice. Irradiated mice immunized with a vaccine strain of T. gondii, and later challenged with a highly virulent strain, were less well protected than unirradiated controls. Irradiation appears to impair early, CD4(+)- and CD(8+)-independent resistance to T. gondii, as well as acquisition of immunity.",Excluded

OBJECTIVES: To assess toxicity and efficacy of intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) for anal cancer., METHODS: Records of 152 patients were reviewed retrospectively from multiple institutions. Data on disease control and toxicity were collected as well as patient and treatment characteristics. Acute (<6 mo) and late (>=6 mo) severe toxicity (grade >=3) were graded. Four patients were excluded due to the presence of metastatic disease or stage TX. Late toxicity data were available for 120 patients., RESULTS: Median cumulative IMRT dose was 51.25 Gy (median, 28 fractions). All but 2 patients received chemotherapy. With median follow-up of 26.8 months, local control at 3 years was 87%, worse for patients with T3-T4 than T1-T2 disease on univariate analysis (79% vs. 90%; P=0.04). Regional control, distant control, and overall survival were 97%, 91%, and 87%, respectively, at 3 years. Nodal status was associated with regional control, distant control, and overall survival (P<0.01 for each). Most common severe acute toxicity was hematologic (41%), skin (20%), and gastrointestinal tract (11%). Two grade 5 toxicities occurred (hematologic and gastrointestinal tract). Severe late toxicity affected skin (1%) and gastrointestinal tract (3%)., CONCLUSIONS: IMRT with chemotherapy resulted in excellent local control. Although T stage predicted worse local control, most T3-T4 disease was controlled with IMRT. Nodal status predicted regional and distant control and overall survival.

2089,"Vertebroplasty combined with anti-osteoporosis treatment reduces refracture rate. BACKGROUND: Currently, vertebral compression fractures are the most common osteoporotic fracture in postmenopausal women; however, incidence of refracture has aroused increasing attention due to a lack of standard treatment. OBJECTIVE(S): To evaluate whether vertebroplasty combined with anti-osteoporosis treatment can reduce refracture rate following osteoporotic vertebral compressive fractures. METHOD(S): Eighty-nine patients with osteoporotic vertebral compressive fractures undergoing vertebroplasty were divided into control group (n=38) and treatment group (n=51) after making an informed choice about treatment. Chest/lumbar X-ray and bone mineral density determinations were performed through outpatient or inpatient follow-up. The spinal stability, bone mineral density and refracture rate of patients in both groups were followed up. RESULTS AND CONCLUSION(S): Seventy-eight patients achieved complete follow-up (ranged from 6-39 months, average 26.73 months). There was no significant difference in the spinal stability between both groups (P > 0.05), while rare bone trabecula was found in the control group. There was a significant difference in bone mineral density between both groups at postoperative 12, 24, and 36 months (P < 0.05). The refracture rate in the treatment group was significantly lower than that in the control group (P < 0.05). Our results indicate that anti-osteoporosis treatment can effectively reduce the incidence of refracture after vertebroplasty in patients with osteoporotic vertebral compressive fractures, and this study found satisfactory short-and medium-term clinical outcomes.Copyright © 2016, Journal of Clinical Rehabilitative Tissue Engineering Research.

558,"Radiofrequency ablation is beneficial in simultaneous treatment of synchronous liver metastases and primary colorectal cancer. Background: In patients with resectable synchronous colorectal liver metastases (CRLM), either twostaged or simultaneous resections of the primary tumor and liver metastases are performed. Data on radiofrequency ablation (RFA) for the treatment of CRLM during a simultaneous procedure is lacking. The primary aim was to analyze short-term and long-term outcome of RFA in simultaneous treatment. A secondary aim was to compare simultaneous resection with the colorectal-first approach. Method(s): Retrospective analysis of 241 patients with colorectal cancer and synchronous CRLM between 2000-2016. Median follow-up was 36.1 months (IQR 18.2-58.8 months). A multivariable analysis was performed to analyze the postoperative morbidity, using the comprehensive complication index. A propensity matched analysis was performed to compare survival rates. Result(s): In multivariable analysis, the best predictor of lower complication severity was treatment with RFA (p = 0.040). Higher complication rates were encountered in patients who underwent an abdominoperineal resection (p = 0.027) or age > 60 years (p = 0.022). The matched analysis showed comparable overall survival in RFA treated patients versus patients undergoing a liver resection with a five year overall survival of 39.4% and 37.5%, respectively (p = 0.782). In a second matched analysis, 5-year overall survival rates in simultaneously treated patients (43.8%) was comparable to patients undergoing the colorectal first approach (43.0%, p = 0.223). Conclusion(s): RFA treatment of CRLM in simultaneous procedures is associated with a lower complication severity and non-inferior oncological outcome as compared to partial liver resection. RFA should be considered a useful alternative to liver resection.Copyright © 2018 Hof et al.

1538,"A decision support tool for early detection of knee OsteoArthritis using X-ray imaging and machine learning: Data from the OsteoArthritis Initiative. This paper presents a fully developed computer aided diagnosis (CAD) system for early knee OsteoArthritis (OA) detection using knee X-ray imaging and machine learning algorithms. The X-ray images are first preprocessed in the Fourier domain using a circular Fourier filter. Then, a novel normalization method based on predictive modeling using multivariate linear regression (MLR) is applied to the data in order to reduce the variability between OA and healthy subjects. At the feature selection/extraction stage, an independent component analysis (ICA) approach is used in order to reduce the dimensionality. Finally, Naive Bayes and random forest classifiers are used for the classification task. This novel image-based approach is applied on 1024 knee X-ray images from the public database OsteoArthritis Initiative (OAI). The results show that the proposed system has a good predictive classification rate for OA detection (82.98% for accuracy, 87.15% for sensitivity and up to 80.65% for specificity).

855,"The Relationship between Media Consumption and Health-Related Anxieties after the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Disaster. Background:The Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster caused a global panic by a release of harmful radionuclides. In a disaster setting, misusage of contemporary media sources available today can lead to disseminated incorrect information and panic. The study aims to build a scale which examines associations between media and individual anxieties, and to propose effective media usages for future disaster management. Method(s):The University of Tokyo collaborated with the Fukushima local government to conduct a radiation-health-seminar for a total of 1560 residents, at 12 different locations in Fukushima. A 13 item questionnaire collected once before and after a radiation-seminar was used on factor analysis to develop sub-scales for multiple regression models, to determine relationships between the sub-scales and media type consumed. A paired t-test was used to examine any changes in sub-scale of pre- and post-seminar scores. Result(s):Three sub-scales were revealed and were associated with different media types: was with rumors, while concern for the future was positively associated with regional-newspapers and negatively with national-newspapers. Anxiety about social-disruption was associated with radio. The seminar had a significant effect on anxiety reduction for all the three sub-scales. Conclusion(s):Different media types were associated with various heightened concerns, and that a radiation seminar was helpful to reduce anxieties in the post-disaster setting. By tailoring post-disaster messages via specific media types, i.e., radio, it may be possible to effectively convey important information, as well as to calm fears about particular elements of post-disaster recovery and to combat rumors. © 2013 Sugimoto et al.",Excluded
561,"Genetic variants in inflammation-related genes are associated with radiation-induced toxicity following treatment for non-small cell lung cancer. Treatment of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with radiotherapy or chemoradiotherapy is often accompanied by the development of esophagitis and pneumonitis. Identifying patients who might be at increased risk for normal tissue toxicity would help in determination of the optimal radiation dose to avoid these events. We profiled 59 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) from 37 inflammation-related genes in 173 NSCLC patients with stage IIIA/IIIB (dry) disease who were treated with definitive radiation or chemoradiation. For esophagitis risk, nine SNPs were associated with a 1.5- to 4-fold increase in risk, including three PTGS2 (COX2) variants: rs20417 (HR:1.93, 95% CI:1.10-3.39), rs5275 (HR:1.58, 95% CI:1.09-2.27), and rs689470 (HR:3.38, 95% CI:1.09-10.49). Significantly increased risk of pneumonitis was observed for patients with genetic variation in the proinflammatory genes IL1A, IL8, TNF, TNFRSF1B, and MIF. In contrast, NOS3:rs1799983 displayed a protective effect with a 45% reduction in pneumonitis risk (HR:0.55, 95% CI:0.31-0.96). Pneumonitis risk was also modulated by polymorphisms in anti-inflammatory genes, including genetic variation in IL13. rs20541 and rs180925 each resulted in increased risk (HR:2.95, 95% CI:1.14-7.63 and HR:3.23, 95% CI:1.03-10.18, respectively). The cumulative effect of these SNPs on risk was dose-dependent, as evidenced by a significantly increased risk of either toxicity with an increasing number of risk genotypes (P,0.001). These results suggest that genetic variations among inflammation pathway genes may modulate the development of radiation-induced toxicity and, ultimately, help in identifying patients who are at an increased likelihood for such events. 2010 Hildebrandt et al.",Excluded
2014,"Comparison of Postoperative Outcomes According to Compensatory Changes of the Thoracic Spine among Patients with a T1 Slope More Than 40degree. Study Design.Retrospective study of postoperative outcomes of adult spinal deformity (ASD) surgery.Objective.To clarify the differences in postoperative outcomes depending on the presence or absence of thoracic compensatory changes among patients with a T1 slope (TS) more than 40degree.Summary of Background Data.Loss correction after ASD surgery is more likely to occur when preoperative TS is more than 40degree. When preoperative TS is more than 40degree, some cases involve compensatory changes in the thoracic spine and decreased thoracic kyphosis (TK); others involve increased TK without compensatory changes.Methods.Seventy-nine patients with TS more than 40degree who underwent ASD surgery were enrolled and separated into compensated and noncompensated groups (group C: TK <40degree; group NC: TK >=40degree). Radiographic parameters obtained by whole-spine standing x-ray, the Oswestry Disability Index (ODI), and Scoliosis Research Society-22 (SRS-22) questionnaire were assessed.Results.There were 41 patients in group C and 38 patients in group NC. Preoperative significant differences in TS did not disappear after surgery (preoperative TS: group C and group NC=46degree and 55degree, P<0.001; just after surgery: group C and group NC=27degree and 40degree, P<0.001; 2 years later: group C and group NC=34degree and 47degree, P<0.001). There were no significant differences in ODI and all domains of the SRS-22 before surgery. However, 2 years after the surgery, ODI (38%), pain (3.5), self-image (3.0), and total (3.2) values of the SRS-22 for group NC were significantly worse than those (28%, 4.0, 3.4, and 3.5, respectively) for group C (P<0.05).Conclusion.Changes in the thoracic spine (TS and TK >40degree) result in poor postoperative outcomes. Extending the upper instrumented vertebra (UIV) to the upper thoracic spine must be considered. Even when TS is more than 40degree, TK less than 40degree, and upper instrumented vertebra set to the lower thoracic level result in good postoperative outcomes.

OBJECTIVES: To assess the feasibility of low-dose time-resolved imaging of contrast kinetics (TRICKS) magnetic resonance (MR) angiography of the pedal vasculature at 3.0 Tesla (T) using a head coil., MATERIALS AND METHODS: Eleven healthy volunteers were imaged using TRICKS MR angiography at 3.0 T with both feet positioned in a head coil. A dose of 7 mL was used for each of 3 acquisitions: images were obtained of each foot in the sagittal plane, and then both feet were imaged simultaneously in the transverse plane. The following parameters were used for acquisition: (TR/TE 4.7 milliseconds/ 1.3 milliseconds, field of view = 28 cm, Flip angle = 30 degrees, 384 x 256 matrix, section thickness = 1.6 mm, Bandwidth = 19.23). The dorsalis pedis, plantar arch, distal posterior tibial, lateral tarsal, and medial plantar arteries were graded for visualization, artifact, and overall image quality on a 4-point scale (1 = worst; 4 = best)., RESULTS: Superior visualization trended towards separate sagittal acquisitions when compared with that of bilateral transverse acquisitions for most of the individual vessels of the foot. Overall, separate sagittal acquisitions (average score = 2.9) were superior to bilateral transverse acquisitions (average score = 2.6). The average image quality score reflecting the amount of artifact was 2.6 for studies obtained using bilateral transverse acquisitions and 3.1 for studies obtained using separate sagittal acquisitions., CONCLUSION: Low-dose gadolinium multi-injection TRICKS and bolus-chase MR angiography at 3.0 T provides an effective and easily reproducible technique for imaging of the pedal vasculature in volunteers and has great potential for clinical application.",Excluded

Conclusion The devised ideal ureteral stent length guide for Malaysian adults is reliable, reduces procedural fluoroscopy time and curtails the incidence of post-procedural stent-related symptoms.",Excluded
978,"Optimizing radiation exposure in screening of body packing: image quality and diagnostic acceptability of an 80 kVp protocol with automated tube current modulation. The aim of this study was to evaluate the objective and subjective image quality of a novel computed tomography (CT) protocol with reduced radiation dose for body packing with 80 kVp and automated tube current modulation (ATCM) compared to a standard body packing CT protocol. 80 individuals who were examined between March 2012 and July 2015 in suspicion of ingested drug packets were retrospectively included in this study. Thirty-one CT examinations were performed using ATCM and a fixed tube voltage of 80 kVp (group A). Forty-nine CT examinations were performed using a standard protocol with a tube voltage of 120 kVp and a fixed tube current time product of 40 mAs (group B). Subjective and objective image quality and visibility of drug packets were assessed. Radiation exposure of both protocols was compared. Contrast-to-noise ratio (group A: 0.56 +/- 0.36; group B: 1.13 +/- 0.91) and Signal-to-noise ratio (group A: 3.69 +/- 0.98; group B: 7.08 +/- 2.67) were significantly lower for group A compared to group B (p < 0.001). Subjectively, image quality was decreased for group A compared to group B (2.5 +/- 0.8 vs. 1.2 +/- 0.4; p < 0.001). Attenuation of body packets was higher with the new protocol (group A: 362.2 +/- 70.3 Hounsfield Units (HU); group B: 210.6 +/- 60.2 HU; p = 0.005). Volumetric Computed Tomography Dose Index (CTDIvol) and Dose Length Product (DLP) were significantly lower in group A (CTDIvol 2.2 +/- 0.9 mGy, DLP 105.7 +/- 52.3 mGycm) as compared to group B (CTDIvol 2.7 +/- 0.1 mGy, DLP 126.0 +/- 9.7 mGycm, p = 0.002 and p = 0.01). The novel 80 kVp CT protocol with ATCM leads to a significant dose reduction compared to a standard CT body packing protocol. The novel protocol led to a diagnostic image quality and cocaine body packets were reliably detected due to the high attenuation.",Excluded

616,"Effectiveness of postoperative radiotherapy on atypical meningioma patients: A population-based study. Purpose: It is controversial whether atypical meningioma patients undergoing gross-total resection (GTR) can benefit from postoperative radiotherapy (PORT). This study aimed to investigate the effectiveness of PORT on atypical meningioma patients. Method(s): Patients diagnosed with atypical meningioma from 2008 to 2015 were extracted from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database. The Kaplan-Meier survival curves were generated, and the log-rank test was used to compare the differences among groups. Univariable and multivariable COX regressions were conducted for survival analyses. Result(s): A total of 1,014 patients were enrolled. The 5-years survival rate of the overall patients was 79.0%. PORT was performed in 315 (31.1%) patients. The utilization rates of PORT in patients undergoing GTR and undergoing subtotal resection (STR) were 26.7% and 42.2%, respectively. For patients undergoing STR, log-rank test showed that overall survival (OS) time was significantly longer in patients receiving PORT than those not (p = 0.026). For patients undergoing GTR, OS time did not show significant association with PORT (p = 0.339). In addition, patients undergoing STR with PORT had no significantly different OS time compared with those undergoing GTR with PORT (p = 0.398). Multivariable Cox regression analysis showed that receipt of PORT (p = 0.187) was not an independent predictor of OS after adjustment. Conclusion(s): PORT may not prolong the OS in atypical meningioma patients undergoing GTR. However, patients undergoing STR may benefit from PORT and achieve similar OS to those undergoing GTR.Copyright © 2019 Zeng, Shi and Guo.",Excluded
2764,"Gene alterations as predictors of radiation-induced toxicity in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma. Background: Optimizing the therapeutic ratio for radiation therapy (RT) in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) is uniquely challenging owing to high rates of early and late toxicity involving nearby organs at risk. These toxicities have a profound impact on treatment compliance and quality of life. Emerging evidence suggests that RT dose alone cannot fully account for the variable severity of RT-related adverse events (rtAEs) observed in HNSCC patients. Next-generation sequencing has become an increasingly valuable tool with widespread use in the oncology field and is being robustly explored for predicting rtAEs beyond dosimetric data. Method(s): Patients who had Foundation Medicine sequencing data and received RT for primary or locally recurrent HNSCC were selected for this study. Early and late toxicity data were collected and reported based on Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events version 5.0. Dosimetric parameters were collected for pertinent structures. Result(s): A total of HNSCC 37 patients were analyzed in this study. Genetic alterations in BRCA2, ERBB3, NOTCH1 and CCND1 were all associated with higher mean grade of toxicity with BRCA2 alteration implicated in all toxicity parameters evaluated including mucositis, early dysphagia, xerostomia and to a lesser extent, late dysphagia. Interestingly, patients who exhibited alterations in both BRCA2 and ERBB3 experienced a twofold or greater increase in early dysphagia, early xerostomia and late dysphagia compared to ERBB3 alteration alone. Furthermore, several gene alterations were associated with improved toxicity outcomes. Within an RT supersensitive patient subset, alterations were found in TNFAIP3, HNF1A, SPTA1 and CASP8. All of these alterations were not found in the RT insensitive patient subset. We found 17 gene alterations in the RT insensitive patient subset that were not found in the RT supersensitive patient subset. Conclusion(s): Despite consistent RT dosimetric parameters, patients with HNSCC experience heterogeneous patterns of rtAEs. Identifying factors associated with toxicity outcomes offers a new avenue for personalized precision RT therapy and prophylactic management. Here, next-generation sequencing in a population of HNSCC patients correlates several genetic alterations with severity of rtAEs. Further analysis is urgently needed to identify genetic patterns associated with rtAEs in order to reduce harmful outcomes in this challenging population.Copyright © 2021, The Author(s).",Excluded
1792,"Stereotactic body radiotherapy vs conventionally fractionated chemoradiation in locally advanced pancreatic cancer: A multicenter case-control study (PAULA-1). Conventionally fractionated chemoradiation (CRT) or chemotherapy (CHT) are considered as standard options in locally advanced pancreatic cancer (LAPC) while stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) is an emerging treatment in this setting. The aim of this study was to compare two cohorts of LAPC patients treated with SBRT +/- CHT vs CRT +/- CHT in terms of local control (LC), distant metastases-free survival (DMFS), progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS), and toxicity. Eighty patients were included. Patients in the two cohorts were matched according to: age <=/>65 years, tumor diameter (two cut-offs: =3.0 and =3.9 cm), clinical tumor stage and clinical nodal stage, neoadjuvant CHT, and adjuvant CHT. Median prescribed total dose was 30.0 Gy (range: 18.0-37.5) and 54.0 Gy (18.0-63.0) in SBRT and CRT cohorts, respectively. Toxicity was evaluated by CTCAE v4.0 scale. Survival curves were calculated by Kaplan-Meier method. For hypothesis testing an equivalence and a non-inferiority test was calculated. No statistically significant differences in terms of acute and late toxicity, DMFS, PFS, and OS were recorded among the two cohorts. Median, 1-, and 2-year LC was: 16.0 months, 53.1%, and 40.5% in the CRT cohort and 22.0 months, 80.4%, and 49.8% in the SBRT cohort, respectively (P:.017). A statistically non-inferiority significance was recorded in terms of OS between CRT and SBRT (P =.031). Patients treated with SBRT showed higher LC rate and similar OS compared to CRT. Therefore, the design of confirmatory randomized studies comparing SBRT and CRT seems justified.Copyright © 2020 The Authors. Cancer Medicine published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd",Excluded
1153,"Phosphorylation of Ser312 contributes to tumor suppression by p53 in vivo. The tumor suppressor p53 is a master sensor of stress, and posttranslational modifications are key in controlling its stability and transcriptional activities. p53 can be phosphorylated on at least 23 Ser/Thr residues, the majority of which are phosphorylated by stress-related kinases. An exception is Ser315 in human p53 (Ser312 in mouse), which is predominantly phosphorylated by cell cyclerelated kinases. To understand the biological importance of Ser312 phosphorylation in vivo, wegenerated p53Ser312Ala knock-in mice. We show here that, although Ser312 is not essential for mouse life span under normal physiological conditions, Ser312Ala mutation dampens p53's activity during embryonic development. This is evident from its partial rescue of embryonic lethality caused by Mdm4 deletion. In agreement with the notion that Ser312 mutation weakens p53 function, Ser312Ala mice are alsomore susceptible to tumorigenesis following a sublethal ionizing radiation dose. Importantly, in the cohort studied, Ser312 mutation predisposes mice to develop thymic lymphomas and liver tumors, partly due to p53Ser312Ala's inability to fully induce a set of p53 target genes including p21 and cyclin G1. Thus, we demonstrate that phosphorylation of Ser312 is required for p53 to function fully as a tumor suppressor in vivo.",Excluded

Background: Scant real-world data exist on the clinical outcomes associated with the use of bevacizumab-containing chemotherapy (B+CT) in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC). The primary objective of the GRETA cohort study was to compare the overall survival (OS) of patients with mCRC treated with first-line B+CT versus chemotherapy (CT) alone, in an Italian clinical practice setting. Material(s) and Method(s): Incident patients with mCRC were identified during the period 2010-2012 from five population-based cancer registries in Italy. Cases were linked to regional health care utilization databases to obtain the entire spectrum of health services provided to each patient. Patients starting a first-line treatment with B+CT or CT alone within 90 days from the diagnosis were included in the study cohort. A propensity score (PS) method was applied to account for residual confounding. Result(s): Of 480 patients with mCRC included in the study cohort, 21.0 received first-line B+CT, and 79.0% received CT. Patients receiving B+CT were younger (p <.001) and underwent surgery more frequently (p =.001). The median OS was 22.5 and 14.6 months for B+CT and CT, respectively (p =.011). The corresponding hazard ratios adjusted by multivariate modeling and PS matched analysis were 0.82 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.62-1.08) and 0.86 (95% CI, 0.56-1.33), respectively. Similar results were observed after subgrouping by age and surgery. Conclusion(s): In this Italian real-world setting of unselected mCRC, the OS of patients treated with B+CT was consistent with previous observational and patient-registry studies. However, definitive evidence of an improvement in OS cannot be drawn. Implications for Practice: Bevacizumab is a well-established first-line treatment for metastatic colorectal cancer. However, there is scarce evidence in the literature about its effectiveness in clinical practice. Evaluating this topic should be of interest for both clinicians and regulatory agencies. In this study, the median overall survival of the bevacizumab cohort was strikingly coherent with that reported in large observational series of unselected patients, thus suggesting a consistent and reproducible effect of the drug in clinical practice. Although consistent results were observed both in the overall population and in age and surgery subgroups, the present study did not offer definitive evidence of an improvement in OS.Copyright © AlphaMed Press 2018",Excluded
3229,"Massive introgression drives species radiation at the range limit of Anopheles gambiae. Impacts of introgressive hybridisation may range from genomic erosion and species collapse to rapid adaptation and speciation but opportunities to study these dynamics are rare. We investigated the extent, causes and consequences of a hybrid zone between Anopheles coluzzii and Anopheles gambiae in Guinea-Bissau, where high hybridisation rates appear to be stable at least since the 1990s. Anopheles gambiae was genetically partitioned into inland and coastal subpopulations, separated by a central region dominated by A. coluzzii. Surprisingly, whole genome sequencing revealed that the coastal region harbours a hybrid form characterised by an A. gambiae-like sex chromosome and massive introgression of A. coluzzii autosomal alleles. Local selection on chromosomal inversions may play a role in this process, suggesting potential for spatiotemporal stability of the coastal hybrid form and providing resilience against introgression of medically-important loci and traits, found to be more prevalent in inland A. gambiae.",Excluded
2530,"Hemi body irradiation: An economical way of palliation of pain in bone metastasis in advanced cancer. Background: The primary aim of this prospective non-randomized study was to evaluate the effect of hemi-body irradiation (HBI) on pain and quality of life in cancer patients with extensive bone metastases. The secondary aim was to evaluate side-effects and cost-effectiveness of the treatment. Material(s) and Method(s): Between March 2008 and December 2010, a total of 23 (male = 14, female = 9, median age = 60 years) diagnosed cases of metastatic cancer patients (prostate = 11, breast = 6, and lung = 6) received HBI, which was delivered as lower (n = 7) (dose = 8 Gy), upper (n = 8) (dose = 6 Gy), or sequential HBI (n = 8) with a Telecobalt unit (Theratron 780C). Among them, one lung cancer patient died at 2 months and one prostate cancer patient defaulted after the second follow-up. Thus, 21 patients (male = 13, female = 8, median age = 65 years) (prostatic cancer = 10, breast cancer = 6, and lung cancer = 5) were followed up for a minimum of 6 months. Evaluations were performed before and at 2, 4, 8, 16, and 24 weeks after treatment. Pain evaluation was done by Visual Analogue Scale (VAS), Verbal Rating Scale (VRS), Percentage of Pain Relief (PRR), and Global Pain Score (GPS). Toxicity was assessed by CTC v-3 toxicity scores in the medical record. Assessment of oral morphine consumption was done before and after radiation using paired t-test, and correlation analysis was also done with decrease of morphine consumption and reduction of pain score using statistical analysis. Result(s): Response (control of pain) was partial (PR) in 67% and complete (CR) in 22% of patients. For most patients, the pain control lasted throughout the follow-up period (6 months). From 66.66% patients requiring 13 or more Morphine (10 mg) tablets per day prior to HBI, none of the patients required to consume 13 or more Morphine (10 mg) tablets per day following HBI, which was correlated with significant reduction in various pain scores (P < 0.05). One way ANOVA with Dunnett's Multiple Comparison Test (P < 0.05) was significant in VAS score changes, VRS score changes, PPR score changes, and GPS score changes. Along with the decrease in morphine tablets, the Linear Correlation of various scales for pain reduction like VAS, VRS, PPR, and GPS were significant. As such, the quality of life was better due to decreased pain and also, a decrease in the dose of analgesics. Grade 1 and 2 hematological toxicity and grade 1 diarrhea were observed as common side-effects. The average total cost of treatment including hospital stay, medicines, and radiation charges was around INR 400.00. Conclusion(s): This study shows that hemibody irradiation is not only an effective modality for palliation of severe bone pain in advanced cancer cases but also economical, involves short hospital stay, with acceptable side-effects, utilizes the simple Telecobalt machine, and is less cumbersome in comparison to other currently available pain palliation methods like oral morphine and radiopharmaceuticals. © 2014.

INTRODUCTION: Smart glasses can be adapted to display radiographic images to allow clinician's gaze not to be directionally fixed or predetermined by computer monitor location. This study presents an analysis of eye lens dose during interventional fluoroscopy guided procedures, comparing fixed monitor positions against the use of smart glasses., METHODS: Using a head phantom (simulating the clinician), thermoluminescent dosimeters and lead shielded glasses, the dose to the eye was measured for different head 'rotations and tilts' for: gaze directed towards the main scattering source (patient/primary beam) to represent potential gaze direction if smart glasses are used; gaze directed to a range of potential computer monitor positions. An anthropomorphic pelvis phantom was utilised to simulate the patient. Accumulated dose rates (muGy s-1) from five 10-second exposures at 75 kV 25.2 mAs were recorded., RESULTS: An average DAP reading of 758.84 cGy cm2 was measured during each 10 second exposure. Whilst wearing lead shielded glasses a 6.10 - fold reduction in dose rate to the lens is possible (p < 0.05). Influence of the direction of gaze by the clinician demonstrated a wide range of dose rate reduction from 3.13% (p = 0.16) to 143.69% (p < 0.05) when the clinician's gaze was towards the main scattering source. Increased dose rate to the clinician's eyes was received despite wearing lead shielded glasses, as the angle of gaze moved 45degree and 90degree from 0degree., CONCLUSION: If the clinician's gaze is directed towards the main scattering source a potential exists for reducing eye lens dose compared with fixed location computer monitors. Introduction of lead lined smart glasses into interventional radiology may lead to improvements in patient care, reducing the need for the clinician to look away from the patient to observe a radiographic image.

Background: Cryoablation of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) close to major organs or viscus is challenging because it can cause complications. This retrospective study aimed to investigate the safety and efficacy of percutaneous argon-helium cryoablation of small HCC located adjacent to major organs or viscus. Material/Methods: Ninety-two patients who underwent percutaneous argon-helium cryoablation between February 2012 and December 2018 at the Fifth Medical Center of the Chinese People's Liberation Army General Hospital were included. Treatment efficacy was evaluated by magnetic resonance imaging or triphasic computed tomography scan within 1 week after each cryoablation procedure. Local tumor progression, distant recurrence, and overall survival were analyzed using the Kaplan-Meier method and log-rank test. Result(s): A total of 92 patients with small HCC located adjacent to major organs or viscus who underwent cryoablation were retrospectively reviewed. The number of patients with tumors adjacent to the gallbladder, portal or hepatic vein, diaphragm, stomach, heart, and intestine was 22, 1, 39, 6, 8, and 16, respectively. Cumulative local tumor progression rates at 1 and 2 years were 2.8% and 7.3%, respectively. Cumulative distant recurrence rates at 1, 2, and 3 years were 11.1%, 17.6%, and 20.7%, respectively. The overall survival rates at 1, 2, and 4 years were 100%, 93.6%, and 74.9%, respectively. Major complications were observed in 5 (5.4%) patients.

1177,"Assessment of periodontal changes in patients undergoing radiotherapy for head and neck malignancy: A hospital-based study. Background: Surgical resection, radio and chemotherapy, either used singly or in combination, are the three most common modalities used in head and neck cancer treatment. These modalities are effective in eradicating the tumor; they also negatively impact the normal head and neck structures surrounding the tumor. Direct damage to the oral structures (soft and hard tissue) frequently occurs from radio and chemotherapy, and indirect damage may also arise from systemic toxicity. Material(s) and Method(s): This prospective study was designed to analyze the effect of radiotherapy on periodontal parameters in oncology patients prior to irradiation in the head and neck area, compared with 6 months following treatment. The statistical analysis was done using SPSS. Result(s): The study sample consisted of total 29 patients of head and neck malignancy (M = 17, F = 12), of mean age 45.66 years. Only 22% of patients had various habits (smoking, tobacco chewing, and alcohol consumption) and majority (27.59% patients) had tongue malignancy.

However, there is little data about the reduction strategy of radiation hazard. Purpose(s):We intended to evaluate the feasibility and effectiveness of low dose radiation protocols compared to current conventional dose protocols in the patients during diagnostic coronary angiography. Method(s): From February 2015 to October 2015, one hundred three consecutive patients (66.2+/-12.3 years old, 46 women (44.7%) who undertook diagnostic coronary angiography using Artis zeeTM angiography system were enrolled. After randomization of low- or conventional radiation dose protocols (LDP versus CDP), The patient underwent coronary angiography according to the standard angiography method (AP-Caudal, RAO-caudal, RAO-cranial, and LAO-cranial views of each 30 degrees, and spider view of 50 degrees and 30 degrees). The LDP consists of 10 frame rate (FR) per second during fluoroscopy and 40% reduced dose of conventional dose during cineangiography. The radial approach was used in all the procedures. We analyzed and compared the dose-area product (DAP: muGy m2), air-kerma (AK: mGy), exposure time (seconds), and FR between the LDP and CDP group. Result(s): Firstly, there is no significant interference to evaluate the coronary artery status by eyeball estimation between both groups. There are no significant basic demographics between the groups including age, body mass index or waist circumferences. Body weight is well correlated with the level of DAP and AK (gamma=0.27, p=0.006 and gamma=0.29, p=0.008 respectively). Marvelously, there are markedly reduction of effective radiation dose in the LDP group compared to CDP group (DAP, 1087.8+/-612.5 vs. 2188.2+/-949.4 muGy m2; AK, 171.5+/-111.6 vs. 348.1+/-178.3 mGy, p<0.001) by Mann-Whitney test, while on the similar total radiation exposure time (50.7+/-21.1 vs. 52.0+/-19.6 sec, p=0.739), FR (662.2+/-197.0 vs. 685.6+/-211.1, p=0.695), and image counts (10.1+/-2.0 vs. 10.7+/-3.5 images) by student t-test.

2260,"Omission of predilation in balloon-expandable transcatheter aortic valve implantation: retrospective analysis in a large-volume centre. AIMS: We aimed to evaluate the effect of omitting predilation on feasibility, procedural results and safety in balloon-expandable TAVI., METHODS AND RESULTS: We performed an analysis of all 680 patients scheduled for a balloon-expandable TAVI prosthesis between January 2011 and August 2016. Patients treated with or without predilation were compared. Procedure times decreased from 85.6+/-42.9 to 56.7+/-26.1 minutes (p<0.001), fluoroscopy times from 9.5+/-5.7 to 6.2+/-3.9 minutes (p<0.001) and contrast volume from 131.9+/-60.8 to 85.4+/-37.4 ml (p<0.001) without predilation. Intraprocedural CPR was significantly more frequent in the predilation group (5.3% vs. 1.4%, p=0.01). Stroke rate was low at 1.5% and with no detectable difference. Applying VARC-2 definitions, the combined endpoints device success (88.3% vs. 92.4%, p=0.07) and clinical efficacy (88.7% vs. 92.4%, p=0.11) were comparable with or without prior valvuloplasty, while early safety was less frequent with predilation (85.2% vs. 90.2%, p=0.04). At 30 days, all-cause mortality and cardiovascular mortality were 6.8% with predilation vs. 2.9% without predilation (p=0.03) and 5.3% vs. 1.4% (p=0.01)., CONCLUSIONS: TAVI without prior valvuloplasty is feasible without apparent adverse impact in patients receiving a balloon-expandable TAVI prosthesis. The omission of predilation is associated with shorter procedure time, less radiation exposure and lower rates of intraprocedural resuscitation.",Excluded
3068,"Dosimetry and toxicity of Quadramet for bone marrow ablation in multiple myeloma and other haematological malignancies. Standard treatment regimens for haematological malignancies include myeloablative chemoradiotherapy and subsequent rescue by stem cell transplantation. However, these treatment regimens have significant associated mortality and morbidity, and disease recurrence remains a problem. One alternative approach is the targeted delivery of radiotherapy to the marrow using a bone-seeking agent labelled with an appropriate radioisotope, with the aim of delivering a potentially ablative radiation dose to marrow while minimising non-haematological toxicity. Pharmacokinetics and radiation dosimetry for a commercial preparation of samarium-153 ethylene diamine tetramethylene phosphonate (EDTMP; Quadramet) were evaluated in 43 tracer (average dose 740 MBq) studies of 42 patients with haematological malignancies. Measurements of 24-h retention were also available following infusion of 18-48 GBq in 15 patients. Quadramet cleared rapidly from the tissue, with a median biological half-life of 1.4 h. Activity taken up by the skeleton was firmly bound, with activity decreasing according to physical half-life at 24 h in 29 of the 43 cases. The percentage activity retained in the skeleton at 24 h with tracer doses was high (62%+/-13%), although this decreased to approximately 30% with therapy infusions. Because of this decrease in retention, the maximum feasible therapy activity for this formulation of Quadramet is 35 GBq. Median absorbed marrow radiation dose was 0.78 Gy/GBq in tracer studies: the decreased retention at high activities means that this corresponds to a median dose of 12 Gy for 35 GBq administered activity. It is possible to use 24-h retention as a rough guide to marrow dose in individual patients. In tracer studies, median bladder radiation dose was 0.22 Gy/GBq and radiation dose to the liver was very conservatively estimated at 0.2 Gy/GBq. After therapy infusions of up to 50 GBq in 37 patients, non-haematopoietic toxicity was not seen in any patient. In addition, myelosuppression was achieved without evidence of myelofibrosis. The residual dose rate to marrow fell to a level acceptable for stem cell re-infusion by 2 weeks after administration.",Excluded

Material(s) and Method(s): Blood samples from six donors were irradiated in vitro with doses ranging from 0.1 to 2 Gy 60Co gamma-rays. Compared were a conventional analysis for dicentrics, the conventional micronucleus (MN) assay, the centromere micronucleus assay using p82H and an alphaAllCen pancentromeric probe, and tricolour FISH with chromosome 2, 4 and 8 DNA probes for the scoring of translocations. Result(s): Agreement in the number of MN between Giemsa-and propidium iodine fluorescence-stained preparations was obtained. The control samples showed higher centromere positivity for the MN after FISH with the p82H probe compared with the alphaAllCen probe. The MN results with both probes showed a slight but systematic increase in the number of centromere-positive MN with dose, indicating that radiation, although principally clastogenic, also has aneuploidogenic properties. The values of the genomic translocation frequency (F(G)) derived from the observed translocation frequencies were systematically higher than the dicentric yields. Comparing the sensitivity of the different methods with restriction of the scoring time to 1 day for biomonitoring purposes, the centromere micronucleus assay had the lowest dose detection limit (0.1 to 0.2 Gy). Conclusion(s): This study shows that at present only the centromere micronucleus assay can combine high sensitivity with a reasonable scoring time for the biomonitoring of relatively large populations.",Excluded
3206,"Long-term outcome and toxicity after dose-intensified treatment with 131I-MIBG for advanced metastatic carcinoid tumors. UNLABELLED: Reported experience with systemic (131)I-metaiodobenzylguanidine ((131)I-MIBG) therapy of neuroendocrine tumors comprises different dosing schemes. The aim of this study was to assess the long-term outcome and toxicity of treatment with 11.1 GBq (300 mCi) of (131)I-MIBG per cycle., METHODS: We performed a retrospective review of 31 patients with advanced metastatic neuroendocrine tumors (20 with carcinoid tumors and 11 with other tumors) treated with (131)I-MIBG. Treatment outcome was analyzed for patients with carcinoid tumors (the most common tumors in this study), and toxicity was analyzed for the entire patient cohort (n = 31). Treatment comprised 11.1 GBq (300 mCi) per course and minimum intervals of 3 mo. The radiographic response was classified according to modified Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors. Toxicity was determined according to Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (version 3.0) for all laboratory data at regular follow-up visits and during outpatient care, including complete blood counts and hepatic and renal function tests. Survival analysis was performed with the Kaplan-Meier curve method (log rank test; P < 0.05)., RESULTS: The radiographic responses in patients with carcinoid tumors comprised a minor response in 2 patients (10%), stable disease in 16 patients (80%; median time to progression, 34 mo), and progressive disease in 2 patients (10%). The symptomatic responses in patients with functioning carcinoid tumors comprised complete resolution in 3 of the 11 evaluable symptomatic patients (27%), partial resolution in 6 patients (55%), and no significant change in 11 patients. The median overall survival in patients with carcinoid tumors was 47 mo (95% confidence interval, 32-62), and the median progression-free survival was 34 mo (95% confidence interval, 13-55). Relevant treatment toxicities were confined to transient myelosuppression of grade 3 or 4 in 15.3% (leukopenia) and 7.6% (thrombocytopenia) of applied cycles and a suspected late adverse event (3% of patients), myelodysplastic syndrome, after a cumulative administered activity of 66.6 GBq. The most frequent nonhematologic side effect was mild nausea (grade 1 or 2), which was observed in 28% of administered cycles. No hepatic or renal toxicities were noted., CONCLUSION: Dose-intensified treatment with (131)I-MIBG at a fixed dose of 11.1 GBq (300 mCi) per cycle is safe and offers effective palliation of symptoms and disease stabilization in patients with advanced carcinoid tumors. The favorable survival and limited toxicity suggest that high cycle activities are suitable and that this modality may be used for targeted carcinoid treatment--either as an alternative or as an adjunct to other existing therapeutic options.",Excluded
90,"Corticofugal modulation of the tactile response coherence of projecting neurons in the gracilis nucleus. Precise and reproducible spike timing is one of the alternatives of the sensory stimulus encoding. We test coherence (repeatability) of the response patterns elicited in projecting gracile neurons by tactile stimulation and its modulation provoked by electrical stimulation of the corticofugal feedback from the somatosensory (SI) cortex. To gain the temporal structure we adopt the wavelet-based approach for quantification of the functional stimulus-neural response coupling. We show that the spontaneous firing patterns (when they exist) are essentially random. Tactile stimulation of the neuron receptive field strongly increases the spectral power in the stimulus and 5- to 15-Hz frequency bands. However, the functional coupling (coherence) between the sensory stimulus and the neural response exhibits ultraslow oscillation (0.07 Hz). During this oscillation the stimulus coherence can temporarily fall below the statistically significant level, i.e., the functional stimulus-response coupling may be temporarily lost for a single neuron. We further demonstrate that electrical stimulation of the SI cortex increases the stimulus coherence for about 60% of cells. We find no significant correlation between the increment of the firing rate and the stimulus coherence, but we show that there is a positive correlation with the amplitude of the peristimulus time histogram. The latter argues that the observed facilitation of the neural response by the corticofugal pathway, at least in part, may be mediated through an appropriate ordering of the stimulus-evoked firing pattern, and the coherence enhancement is more relevant in gracilis nucleus than an increase of the number of spikes elicited by the tactile stimulus.",Excluded
1722,"Radiation exposure of extracranial organs at risk during stereotactic linac radiosurgery. BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Stereotactic radiosurgery of intracranial tumors and vascular malformations can be performed by either a linear accelerator (Linac) or gamma knife. The aim of this first study on patients was to determine the radiation exposure of organs at risk and assess the risk for late effects including secondary tumors and/or hereditary disorders after stereotactic Linac radiosurgery., MATERIAL AND METHODS: Thermoluminescent dosimetry (TLD) measurements were done on 21 consecutively admitted patients with various intracranial lesions scheduled for Linac radiosurgery. The TLD chips were placed on the eyelid, thyroid, breast and the regions of the ovary or testes., RESULTS: The mean doses in organs at risk were 276 +/- 200 mGy (eye lens), 155 +/- 83 mGy (thyroid), 47 +/- 22 mGy (breast), 20 +/- 12 mGy (ovary), and 9 +/- 3 mGy (testes). The doses decreased significantly with a larger distance from the isocenter., CONCLUSION: The absorbed doses to the extracranial organs at risk in patients undergoing Linac radiosurgery were very low, ranging from 0.025% (testes) to 0.76% (eye lens) of the mean maximum target dose (36 Gy). Nevertheless, while the majority of radiosurgery patients have benign tumors or arteriovenous malformations and their life expectancy is long, all doses should be kept as low as reasonably achievable. This could be accomplished by the use of modern irradiation techniques including conformal beams with micro-multileaf collimator and avoiding beams directed to the trunk.",Excluded
3110,"Carcinogenesis studies with benzoyl peroxide (Panoxyl gel 5%). Several groups of hairless mice were given UV radiation with and without pretreatment with 7,12-dimethylbenz(a)anthracene (DMBA), 5% benzoyl peroxide in a gel (Panoxyl), and gel alone, in various combinations, with appropriate control groups included, in order to see whether benzoyl peroxide, which is known to enhance chemical skin carcinogenesis after a single, small dose of DMBA, also enhances UV carcinogenesis. The mice were observed for skin tumors, and all skin lesions were histologically investigated. The percentage of tumor-bearing animals with time is called the tumor rate, the total number of tumors occurring is called the tumor yield. Continual treatment with 5% benzoyl peroxide in gel twice a week, with or without a short pretreatment period of UV radiation resulted in only 2 skin carcinomas, which is remarkable, but not significant. Both Panoxyl and gel alone enhanced tumorigenicity significantly in animals pretreated with a single dose of 51.2 micrograms DMBA. There was no difference between the enhancement caused by Panoxyl and the gel as regards the tumor rate, but when measured as final tumor yield, Panoxyl was slightly more tumor-enhancing than gel alone. However, both Panoxyl and gel protected significantly against UV tumorigenesis (all tumors). There was no difference between the protective effect of the 2 types of treatment. Neither Panoxyl nor gel alone influenced significantly UV skin carcinogenesis (malignant tumors). It is concluded that under these experimental conditions both Panoxyl and gel alone tend to protect against the tumorigenicity and do not enhance the carcinogenicity of UV radiation in hairless mice, whereas both gel and Panoxyl enhance chemical carcinogenesis. The carcinogenic mechanisms may be different for UV and chemical carcinogenesis, respectively.",Excluded
1269,"Experiences of xerostomia after radiotherapy in patients with head and neck cancer: A qualitative study. AIMS AND OBJECTIVES: To describe the experiences of radiation-induced xerostomia in patients with head and neck cancer., BACKGROUND: Xerostomia is the most commonly occurring complication during and following radiotherapy. It can persist for several months or years and can have a significant impact on patients' quality of life., DESIGN: This was a qualitative descriptive study., METHODS: Semi-structured interviews were conducted with a sample of 20 participants. Inductive content analysis was used to analyse the qualitative data., RESULTS: Analysis of the manifest content identified five categories: communication problems, physical problems, psychosocial problems, treatment problems and relief strategies. The latent content was formulated into a theme: due to lack of information from professionals, the patients had to find their own solutions for their problems., CONCLUSIONS: Xerostomia is not only a biophysical symptom but also has a profound effect on the emotional, intellectual and sociocultural dimensions of life. The majority of patients continued to suffer from xerostomia and its associated symptoms after radiotherapy, in part, because of a lack of professional support, including the inability of nurses to provide oral health care., RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE: Nurses need to be knowledgeable about the effects of radiotherapy on oral mucosa and about appropriate interventions. The healthcare system requires a symptom management platform for radiation-induced complications, to help patients, their families and healthcare professionals obtain information about self-care, treatments and relief strategies.

3321,"Olecranon fractures in adults: Factors influencing outcome. In a retrospective, non-randomized study, we reviewed our experience with the operative treatment of olecranon fractures to find out which factors correlate with subjective complaints and functional outcome. A total of 95 consecutive olecranon fractures were operatively treated in our level I trauma institution between 1 March 1992 and 1 March 2000. Medical records and X-rays of all patients were evaluated. Three patients died, 23 were lost to follow-up. Fifty-eight of 69 available patients (84.0%) were reviewed clinically and/or radiologically after a mean time of 36 months. Fracture type, fracture classification, associated lesions, technical correctness of osteosynthesis, age and comorbidity were analysed. Radiological end result (intraarticular steps, gaps, arthrosis), subjective complaints, mobility of the elbow joint and muscle strength were evaluated. Patients with an unstable elbow (Mayo classification Type III and Schatzker-Schmeling classification Type D) had a higher loss of elbow function than others. There was a correlation between fracture morphology (fractures Type C and Type D in the Schatzker-Schmeling classification) and arthrosis. There also was a correlation between suboptimal osteosynthesis and arthrosis. There was no correlation between suboptimal osteosynthesis, implant loosening and secondary procedures. Patients more often expressed subjective complaints and loss of function in activities of daily life before than after metal removal. Primary elbow instability and fracture morphology are prognostic factors for elbow function and development of arthrosis after operative treatment of olecranon fractures. We, therefore, recommend the classification systems of the Mayo-clinic or of Schatzker-Schmeling. As many patients have complaints related to the implants, we recommend metal removal after fracture healing. © 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",Excluded
2355,"Treatment of recurrent bronchial carcinoma: the role of high-dose-rate endoluminal brachytherapy. PURPOSE: This study's aim was to assess outcome and toxicity of high-dose-rate endoluminal brachytherapy (HDREB) for recurrent bronchial carcinoma., METHODS AND MATERIALS: From 1987 to 2005, 41 patients were treated with HDREB for symptomatic recurrent bronchial carcinoma. All patients had previously undergone external beam radiotherapy (EBRT) with a median dose of 56 Gy (range, 30-70 Gy). The median HDREB dose applied was 15 Gy (range, 5-29 Gy). The median time interval between primary EBRT and reirradiation was 9 months (range, 2-54 months)., RESULTS: After a median follow-up of 6.7 months, the 6-, 12-, and 24-month overall survival rates were 58%, 18%, and 7%, respectively. The median overall survival time was 6.7 months. Local remission was achieved in 73% of patients (n = 30). A total of 24% of patients (n = 10) showed no response or progressive disease within 8 weeks after treatment. In 1 patient, treatment response was not documented. The 6-, 12-, and 24-month local control rates were 38%, 17%, and 3%, respectively. The median local progression-free survival time was 4 months (range, 1-23 months). Prognostic factors were a total dose of >or=15 Gy of HDREB (p = 0.029) and a Karnofsky performance score of >or=80% (p = 0.0012). The cause of death was locoregional progression in 27% of patients (n = 11), distant metastases in 24% of patients (n = 10), fatal hemorrhage in 15% of patients (n = 6), and other causes in 29% of patients (n = 12). None of the patients with locally controlled disease showed grade 3 or 4 late effects., CONCLUSIONS: Palliative treatment of symptomatic, locally recurrent bronchial carcinoma with HDREB can effectively relieve symptoms in the majority of patients while causing only few complications. Still, time to progression is short. Copyright 2010 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.",Excluded
1022,"Radiation Exposure During Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement: Impact of Arterial Approach and Prosthesis Type. Background: The impact of novel alternative access and valve type on radiation exposure during transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) has not yet been evaluated. This study sought to determine the impact of a transarterial approach and prosthesis type on physician and patient exposure to radiation during TAVR. Method(s): This was a prospective study including 140 consecutive patients undergoing TAVR by transfemoral (n = 102) or transcarotid (TC) (n = 38) access at 2 centers. Implanted valves were the self-expanding Evolut R/PRO system (Medtronic, Minneapolis, MN; n = 38) and the balloon-expandable SAPIEN 3 valve (Edwards Lifesciences, Irvine, CA; n = 102). The primary endpoint was first operator radiation exposure. The secondary endpoint was patient radiation exposure. Result(s): First operator radiation exposure was 4-fold greater during TC TAVR (P < .001). The use of a self-expanding valve was associated with a longer x-ray time (P = .015) and a 2-fold greater first operator radiation dose (P = .018). Patient radiation dose was not significantly affected by arterial approach (P = .055) or valve type (P = .095). After adjustment for potential confounders, the TC approach remained associated with a 174.8% (95% confidence interval, 80.6-318.3, P < .001) increase in first operator radiation dose, whereas the use of a self-expanding valve no longer influenced the first operator dose (P = .630). Conclusion(s): TC access and the use of a self-expanding valve were associated with a 4- and 2-fold greater first operator radiation exposure during TAVR procedures, respectively. Unlike the arterial approach, the effect of bioprosthesis type on radiation exposure was mainly related to x-ray time and was no longer significant after adjustment.Copyright © 2021 The Society of Thoracic Surgeons",Excluded

702,"In vivo dosimetry during DSA of the carotid and renal arteries. Deriviation of local DRLs. The Euratom directive 97/43 recommends the use of patient dose surveys in diagnostic radiology and the establishment of diagnostic reference dose levels (DRLs). The aims of this study are to perform measurements of the entrance surface dose (ESD) during diagnostic digital subtraction angiography (DSA) of the renal and carotid arteries using thermoluminescence dosemeters (TLDs), extraction of local DRLs, and calculation of the effective dose. Dose measurement for the staff was also performed. Dose measurements were performed on 48 participating patients. The mean effective dose was calculated to be 15.9 mSv and 8.9 mSv, for the renal and carotid DSA, respectively. The effective dose of the radiologist was calculated to be 0.022 mSv and 0.023 mSv per procedure for renal and carotid DSA respectively, when wearing a protective apron and using a movable ceiling mounted shield. Radiation dose variation depends on the physical characteristics of the patient, on the procedure preferences by radiologists and on the difficulties in conducting the procedures. The lack of DRLs for the specific examinations lead the research team to choose the DRL for DSA of the renal arteries to be 169 mGy for ESD at the pelvic region and for DSA of the carotid arteries to be 313 mGy for ESD at the region of the aortic arc.",Excluded

OBJECTIVE: To determine whether the amount of tagged stool and fluid significantly affects the radiation exposure in low-dose screening CT colonography performed with an automatic tube-current modulation technique., METHODS: The study included 311 patients. The tagging agent was barium (n = 271) or iodine (n = 40). Correlation was measured between mean volume CT dose index (CTDI (vol)) and the estimated x-ray attenuation of the tagged stool and fluid (ATT). Multiple linear regression analyses were performed to determine the effect of ATT on CTDI (vol ) and the effect of ATT on image noise while adjusting for other variables including abdominal circumference., RESULTS: CTDI (vol) varied from 0.88 to 2.54 mGy. There was no significant correlation between CTDI (vol) and ATT (p = 0.61). ATT did not significantly affect CTDI (vol) (p = 0.93), while abdominal circumference was the only factor significantly affecting CTDI (vol) (p < 0.001). Image noise ranged from 59.5 to 64.1 HU.

BACKGROUND: Gadolinium-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (GdMRI) is routinely used in the evaluation and management of suspected retrocochlear pathology such as vestibular schwannoma. However, its value in the evaluation and diagnosis of cochlear pathology associated with sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL) has been less clear., STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective review of case histories and imaging studies of patients with SNHL and cochlear enhancement on GdMRI diagnosed between 1998 and 2000., RESULTS: Five patients with SNHL who required gadolinium administration to establish the diagnosis of endocochlear disease were identified. Diagnosed lesions included an intralabyrinthine schwannoma, intracochlear hemorrhage, radiation-induced ischemic change, autoimmune labyrinthitis, and meningogenic labyrinthitis. In these illustrative cases, the GdMRI demonstrated intrinsic high signal or contrast enhancement within the cochlea and labyrinth in the absence of a retrocochlear mass. In one patient with meningogenic labyrinthitis, cochlear enhancement on MRI led to prompt cochlear implantation before the potential development of cochlear ossification., CONCLUSION: Our experience suggests that GdMRI plays a crucial role in the diagnosis of cochlear pathology associated with sensorineural hearing loss and may directly impact patient management.",Excluded

Patients were randomly assigned to pilocarpine (5 mg, PILO, n=29) or placebo group (PLA, n=29). These drugs were taken 5 times daily during radiotherapy (first study phase) and 4 times daily for 5 weeks thereafter (second study phase). Saliva was collected and estimated for not stimulated and stimulated patients using the SAXON method., RESULTS: At the conclusion of the first phase, PILO patients reported a better global quality of life (P=.02) and less oral discomfort (P=.001) when compared to PLA. No significant difference was noted in the level of saliva, xerostomia, and other symptoms between patients in PILO and PLA.

3072,"The effects of exposure to microgravity and reconditioning of the lumbar multifidus and anterolateral abdominal muscles: implications for people with LBP. BACKGROUND CONTEXT: One of the primary changes in the neuromuscular system in response to microgravity is skeletal muscle atrophy, which occurs especially in muscles that maintain posture while being upright on Earth. Reduced size of paraspinal and abdominal muscles has been documented after spaceflight. Exercises are undertaken on the International Space Station (ISS) during and following space flight to remediate these effects. Understanding the adaptations which occur in trunk muscles in response to microgravity could inform the development of specific countermeasures, which may have applications for people with conditions on Earth such as low back pain (LBP). PURPOSE: The aim of this study was to examine the changes in muscle size and function of the lumbar multifidus (MF) and anterolateral abdominal muscles (1) in response to exposure to 6 months of microgravity on the ISS and (2) in response to a 15-day reconditioning program on Earth. DESIGN: Prospective longitudinal series. PATIENT SAMPLE: Data were collected from five astronauts who undertook seven long-duration missions on the ISS. OUTCOME MEASURES: For the MF muscle, measures included cross-sectional area (CSA) and linear measures to assess voluntary isometric contractions at vertebral levels L2 to L5. For the abdominal muscles, the thickness of the transversus abdominis (TrA), obliquus internus abdominis (IO) and obliquus externus abdominis (EO) muscles at rest and on contraction were measured. METHOD(S): Ultrasound imaging of trunk muscles was conducted at four timepoints (preflight, postflight, mid-reconditioning, and post reconditioning). Data were analyzed using multilevel linear models to estimate the change in muscle parameters of interest across three time periods. RESULT(S): Beta-coefficients (estimates of the expected change in the measure across the specified time period, adjusted for the baseline measurement) indicated that the CSA of the MF muscles decreased significantly at all lumbar vertebral levels (except L2) in response to exposure to microgravity (L3=12.6%; L4=6.1%, L5=10.3%; p<.001), and CSAs at L3-L5 vertebral levels increased in the reconditioning period (p<.001). The thickness of the TrA decreased by 34.1% (p<.017), IO decreased by 15.4% (p=.04), and the combination of anterolateral abdominal muscles decreased by 16.2% (p<.001) between pre- and postflight assessment and increased (TrA<0.008; combined p=.035) during the postreconditioning period. Results showed decreased contraction of the MF muscles at the L2 (from 12.8% to 3.4%; p=.007) and L3 (from 12.2% to 5%; p=.032) vertebral levels following exposure to microgravity which increased (L2, p=.046) after the postreconditioning period. Comparison with preflight measures indicated that there were no residual changes in muscle size and function after the postreconditioning period, apart from CSA of MF at L2, which remained 15.3% larger than preflight values (p<.001). CONCLUSION(S): In-flight exercise countermeasures mitigated, but did not completely prevent, changes in the size and function of the lumbar MF and anterolateral abdominal muscles. Many of the observed changes in size and control of the MF and abdominal muscles that occurred in response to prolonged exposure to microgravity paralleled those seen in people with LBP or exposed to prolonged bed rest on Earth. Daily individualized postflight reconditioning, which included both motor control training and weight-bearing exercises with an emphasis on retraining strength and endurance to re-establish normal postural alignment with respect to gravity, restored the decreased size and control of the MF (at the L3-L5 vertebral levels) and anterolateral abdominal muscles. Drawing parallels between changes which occur to the neuromuscular system in microgravity and which exercises best recover muscle size and function could help health professionals tailor improved interventions for terrestrial populations. Results suggested that the principles underpinning the exercises developed for astronauts following prolonged exposure to microg avity (emphasizing strength and endurance training to re-establish normal postural alignment and distribution of load with respect to gravity) can also be applied for people with chronic LBP, as the MF and anterolateral abdominal muscles were affected in similar ways in both populations. The results may also inform the development of new astronaut countermeasures targeting the MF and abdominal muscles.Copyright © 2020 Elsevier Inc.",Excluded

Objective(s): We report the effective radiation dose from index and downstream testing in low to intermediate risk symptomatic patients evaluated for chest pain in the ED with either CCTA or usual care to define various sources of patient radiation dose and quantify effective dose over a year and a half of follow-up. Patients and Methods: We evaluated radiation exposure from initial and downstream testing in a prospectively collected, matched cohort evaluated for CP in the emergency department (ED) with either CCTA compared with usual care over a median follow-up of 19.6 months. Effective radiation dose was calculated using published conversion factors. Result(s): Prospective, ECG-triggered acquisition using a 128-slice dual-source multidetector computed tomography (DSCT) scanner was performed in 92.9% of scans with a median effective dose from CCTA of 6.8 mSv (IQR 5.2, 9.1 mSv). CCTA cohort patients were more likely to undergo cardiac testing with exposure to radiation (P < 0.001); however, the median effective dose in patients exposed to radiation from cardiac testing was significantly lower in the CCTA cohort (7.1 mSv vs. 11.8 mSv, P < 0.001). Fewer patients in the CCTA cohort had additional non-cardiac thoracic imaging radiation exposure (40.8%) compared with usual care (92.8%). Total radiation exposure from any source was similar between the CCTA and usual care groups (100% vs 98.4%, P = 0.087), as was median total effective radiation dose (P = 0.105). Upfront CCTA was not associated with higher rates of incidental non-cardiac findings. Conclusion(s): Initial evaluation of acute chest pain in the ED with CCTA was not associated with an increase in total radiation exposure over a follow-up period of 19 months. CCTA offers a more comprehensive evaluation of multiple thoracic organ systems leading to reduced radiation exposure from non-cardiac thoracic testing and no increase in incidental imaging findings. This may represent an added benefit in this population of patients presenting acutely.Copyright © 2015, Iranian Society of Echocardiography.",Excluded
2660,"Comparison of the effectiveness of MRI perfusion and fluorine-18 FDG PET-CT for differentiating radiation injury from viable brain tumor: a preliminary retrospective analysis with pathologic correlation in all patients. OBJECTIVES: Differentiating radiation injury from viable tumor is important for optimizing patient care. Our aim was to directly compare the effectiveness of fluorine-18 fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) positron emission tomography-computed tomography (PET-CT) and dynamic susceptibility-weighted contrast-enhanced (DSC) magnetic resonance (MR) perfusion in differentiating radiation effects from tumor growth in patients with increased enhancement following radiotherapy for primary or secondary brain tumors., MATERIALS AND METHODS: We retrospectively identified 12 consecutive patients with primary and secondary brain tumors over a 1-year period that demonstrated indeterminate enhancing lesions after radiotherapy and that had undergone DSC MR perfusion, FDG PET-CT, and subsequent histopathologic diagnosis. The maximum standardized uptake value (SUV) of the lesion (SUVlesion max), SUVratio (SUVlesion max/SUVnormal brain), maximum relative cerebral blood volume, percentage of signal intensity recovery, and relative peak height were calculated from the positron emission tomography and MR perfusion studies. A prediction of tumor or radiation injury was made based on these variables while being blinded to the results of the surgical pathology., RESULTS: SUVratio had the highest predictive value (area under the curve=0.943) for tumor progression, although this was not statistically better than any MR perfusion metric (area under the curve=0.757-0.829)., CONCLUSIONS: This preliminary study suggests that FDG PET-CT and DSC MR perfusion may demonstrate similar effectiveness for distinguishing tumor growth from radiation injury. Assessment of the SUVratio may increase the sensitivity and specificity of FDG PET-CT for differentiating tumor and radiation injury. Further analysis is needed to help define which modality has greater predictive capabilities. Copyright © 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.",Excluded
2592,"Evaluation of arm function and quality of life after trimodality treatment for superior sulcus tumours. OBJECTIVESFollowing trimodality treatment for superior sulcus tumours (SSTs), the 5-year survival rate has significantly improved. Quality of life and potential negative effects of this strategy have become more important. The objective of this study was to investigate the quality of life and the arm and shoulder function after the resection of superior sulcus tumours following neoadjuvant chemoradiation.METHODSPatients were selected from a thoracic surgery database. Between January 2002 and December 2010, 72 patients received trimodality treatment of whom 39 were alive at the start of this study in 2010. The following arm function tests were used: nine-hole peg test, range of motion test and action research arm test. Quality of life was assessed using the Disability of the arm and shoulder and SF-36 questionnaires. Analyses of the arm function were conducted comparing the treated side with the untreated side. For quality of life, patients treated on their dominant side were compared with those treated on their non-dominant side.RESULTSIn total, 19 patients participated in this study (15 men and 4 women). The median age was 59 years (range 39-73), median radiation dose 50 Gy (range 39-66) and median follow-up 40 months (range 4-101). There was no statistically significant difference in arm and shoulder function between the treated and the untreated arm. However, statistically significantly less pain was found if patients were treated on their dominant side.CONCLUSIONSAfter the resection of SSTs following chemoradiotherapy, the arm and shoulder function on the affected side is comparable with the functions at the contralateral side. Patients treated for an SST on their dominant side are less affected in their quality of life regarding pain compared with those treated on their non-dominant side. © 2012 The Author.",Excluded
979,"Extramedullary plasmacytoma: Clinical and histopathologic study. Purpose: To review the histories of extramedullary plasmacytoma patients diagnosed in Slovenia between 1969 and 1999, to determine the relationship between radiotherapy (XRT) dose and local tumor control, and to clarify the role of elective nodal XRT and the prognostic value of Bartl's histologic grading criteria (originally devised for multiple myeloma [MM]). Methods and Materials: The database of the Cancer Registry of Slovenia was used for the identification of patients. The inclusion criteria were as follows: bone marrow biopsy showing less than 10% plasma cells, normal skeletal survey, and immunohistochemically determined tumor monoclonality. Simulation/portal films were reviewed to assess the extent of elective nodal XRT. Result(s): Twenty-six patients with 31 tumors fulfilled the inclusion criteria. In 4 patients, nine metachronously appearing solitary tumors were diagnosed. The head-and-neck region and other body sites were the sites of origin of primary tumors in 84% and 16% of patients, respectively, whereas in the two regions, regional disease was seen in 15% and 60% of patients, respectively. Therapy was as follows: XRT, 12 patients; surgery and postoperative XRT, 15 patients; and surgery, 4 patients. Ultimate local and regional control rates were 90% and 97%, respectively, and MM developed in 2 (8%) patients. The 10-year disease-specific and overall survival rates were 87% and 61%, respectively. The analysis of the dose-effect relationship showed that more conservative treatment is justified: for macroscopic disease, 40-50 Gy (2 Gy/day), adjusted to the bulk of disease; for microscopic disease, 36-40 Gy; after R0 surgery, no XRT is required, but close observation is needed. No attempts should be made to treat uninvolved nodal regions. Using Bartl's histologic grading criteria, trends were detected in patients with higher tumor grades: regional lymph node involvement (p = 0.04) and shorter disease-specific survival (p = 0.08). Conclusion(s): Extramedullary plasmacytoma is a highly curable disease when XRT is used with or without previous surgery. The rate of conversion to MM is low. Moderate-dose XRT using limited fields is recommended. The prognostic value of Bartl's grading system needs further evaluation. © 2002 Elsevier Science Inc.",Excluded
1456,"Clinical Spectrum and Outcomes of Ocular and Periocular Complications following External-Beam Radiotherapy for Inoperable Malignant Maxillary Sinus Tumors. Purpose: To highlight the clinical spectrum, management, and outcomes of ocular/periocular complications following high-dose external-beam radiotherapy (EBRT) for inoperable malignant maxillary sinus-involving tumors (MMST). Method(s): A retrospective, interventional case series. All patients who were diagnosed with inoperable MMST (with orbital involvement) and treated with high-dose fractionated EBRT (65 Gy in 30 fractions) at James Cook University Hospital, UK, were included. Result(s): Seven patients with advanced MMST (T4aN0M0-T4bN2cM0) were included and were followed up for 23.8 +/- 10.2 months. Severe lid margin disease, dry eye, and neurotrophic keratopathy were universally observed. Other complications included cicatricial conjunctivitis (71%), corneal perforation (57%), limbal stem cell deficiency (LSCD; 43%), glaucoma (29%), and superimposed candida keratitis (14%). Amniotic membrane transplant (AMT; 71%), tarsorrhaphy (43%), tectonic keratoplasty (29%), and evisceration (14%) were warranted. Intact corneal epithelium was observed in all patients and good corrected-distance visual acuity (>=20/60) was observed in 3 (43%) patients at final follow-up. Conclusion(s): High-dose EBRT for inoperable MMST can lead to a wide array of severe ocular/periocular complications. AMT serves as a potentially useful treatment modality to restore the ocular surface integrity after severe radiation keratopathy. We advocate active monitoring for any evolving ophthalmic complications during and after EBRT to enable timely intervention.Copyright © 2020 S. Karger AG, Basel.",Excluded
3083,"Prospective Randomized Comparison of Knee Stability and Proprioception for Posterior Cruciate Ligament Reconstruction With Autograft, Hybrid Graft, and gamma-Irradiated Allograft. PURPOSE: To evaluate posterior stability and proprioception after arthroscopic posterior cruciate ligament reconstruction with autograft, hybrid graft, and gamma-irradiated allograft., METHODS: This prospective, randomized controlled trial (with 5 years' follow-up) included 90 patients who underwent posterior cruciate ligament reconstruction with autograft (gracilis and semitendinosus tendons), hybrid graft (gamma-irradiated tibialis anterior tendon allograft and semitendinosus tendon autograft), or gamma-irradiated allograft (tibialis anterior tendons). All the gamma-irradiated allografts (tibialis anterior tendons) received an irradiation dose of 2.5 Mrad before distribution. Patients in this study had undergone a preoperative magnetic resonance imaging scan and physical examination. Patients were excluded from the study if they had a concomitant injury to other knee ligaments, previous surgery on the injured knee, or articular cartilage lesions greater than Outerbridge grade II. Clinical and proprioceptive evaluation results were collected preoperatively and at 3, 6, 12, 24, 36, and 60 months after surgery., RESULTS: The autograft, allograft, and hybrid graft groups were followed up for 5.5 +/- 0.2 months (range, 5 to 6 years), 5.7 +/- 0.3 months (range, 5 to 6 years), and 5.6 +/- 0.5 months (range, 5 to 6 years), respectively. No statistically significant differences were found among the 3 groups regarding preoperative demographic factors (P > .05). The differences in physical examination findings and subjective evaluations among the 3 groups were not significant (P > .05). However, a significant difference was detected in instrumented anteroposterior measurements, with more laxity shown in the gamma-irradiated allograft group than in the other 2 groups (P = .006)., CONCLUSIONS: The differences in proprioceptive and functional outcomes among the 3 groups were not significant. In contrast, a significant difference was detected in instrumented anteroposterior measurements, which showed more laxity in the gamma-irradiated allograft group than in the other 2 groups.

3269,"CT manifestations and bone marrow pathological features of pulmonary histoplasmosis. Objective: To observe the imaging and clinico-pathological manifestations of pulmonary histoplasmosis (HP). Method(s): Data of 14 patients with pathologically diagnosed lung HP and received antifungal therapy were analyzed. All patients underwent transbronchial lung biopsy (TBLB), bone marrow biopsy and bone marrow hematoxylin and eosin (HE) staining, periodic acid Schiff (PAS) staining, gomori methenamine silver (GMS) staining and immunohistochemical test, while 11 patients underwent broncho alveolar lavage (BAL) and broncho alveolar lavage fluid (BALF) bacteria culture. Ultrasonography results of abdominal and superficial lymph nodes were recorded. Result(s): Among 14 patients, 12 had influenza-like symptoms and 2 had no symptom. Chest CT showed that 1 case of nodular type and 13 cases of mixed type, with multiple pulmonary nodules, exudation and consolidation, some nodules with cavities and all nodules slightly enhanced. Enlarged lymph nodes were observed in 3 cases. Bronchial and alveolar inflammation were showed with TBLB examination, but results of BALF bacterial culture were all negative. HE staining of bone marrow showed histiocytic hyperplasia and granuloma formation. PAS staining all showed magenta mycelia and spores. GMS staining all showed dark brown mycelia and spores. Immunohistochemical CD68 expression (+) indicated macrophages swallowed histoplasmas. The effect of antifungal therapy in all patients was obvious, and intrapulmonary lesions were generally absorbed.

2905,"Optimization of radioembolic effect with extended-shelf-life yttrium-90 microspheres: results from a pilot study. PURPOSE: To evaluate the safety and efficacy of yttrium-90 ((90)Y) radioembolization with extended-shelf-life glass microspheres. We postulated that this approach, for the same planned tissue dose of 120 Gy, would increase the embolic load, improve distribution, and result in enhanced tumor response without causing additional adverse events., MATERIALS AND METHODS: Between June 2007 and September 2008, 50 patients with extensive tumor burden and/or markedly hypervascular tumors (13 hepatocellular carcinomas, and 37 liver metastases) underwent radioembolization with extended-shelf-life microspheres at a planned dose of 120 Gy. Baseline and follow-up imaging and laboratory data were obtained. Response in the target lesion was assessed with cross-sectional imaging by using World Health Organization (WHO) and European Association for the Study of the Liver (EASL) guidelines., RESULTS: The mean delivered radiation dose was 126 Gy. The mean increase in embolic load with this approach was 111%, corresponding to an increase from 3.6 to 7.3 million microspheres. Clinical toxicities included fatigue (28 patients, 56%), abdominal pain (19 patients, 38%), and nausea/vomiting (six patients, 12%). Grade 3-4 bilirubin toxicity was seen in one patient. Two gastroduodenal ulcers were observed. With cross-sectional imaging, response rates according to WHO and EASL guidelines were 51% and 69%, respectively., CONCLUSIONS: The results demonstrate the safety and efficacy of extended-shelf-life (90)Y glass microspheres. The increased embolic load and lowered activity per microsphere theoretically resulted in better tumor coverage and, hence, improved response rates. This standardizable treatment paradigm provides a minimally embolic therapy for liver tumors.",Excluded
2992,"Combined concomitant boost radiotherapy and chemotherapy in stage III-IV head and neck carcinomas: a comparison of toxicity and treatment results with those observed after radiotherapy alone. BACKGROUND: Alteration of radiation therapy (RT) fractionation and the combination of chemotherapy (CT) with RT represent two predominant fields of current research in the treatment of head and neck carcinomas. To assess the potential integration of these two fields, a retrospective comparison of toxicity and treatment outcome was carried out in stage III-IV patients treated with a concomitant boost RT schedule with or without CT., PATIENTS AND METHODS: Fifty-two patients were treated by RT alone and 35 by RT and CT. In the RT group, there were significantly fewer T3-4 tumors (56% vs. 88%, P = 0.002) and higher proportion of planned neck dissections (35% vs. 14%, P = 0.047). The planned total dose was 69.9 Gy delivered over 5.5 weeks. In 10 cases CT was given before RT and in 25 concomitantly with RT, either alone or with neoadjuvant and/ or adjuvant CT. All patients but two had cisplatin-based (CDDP, 100 mg/m2) CT, associated in 28 patients with 5-fluorouracil (5-FU, 1000 mg/m2/24 h x 5). The median follow-up for the surviving patients was 21 and 31 months for the RT and RT-CT groups respectively., RESULTS: Grade 3-4 acute toxicity (RTOG) was observed in 73% and 36% of patients, and grade 3 dysphagia in 31% and 57% (P = 0.02) respectively in the RT and RT-CT groups. The rates of grade 3-4 late complications were similar in the two groups (5% vs. 12%). At three years, actuarial loco-regional control (LRC) was 57% and 66% (P = 0.66) and overall survival was 56% and 47% (P = 0.99) in the RT and RT-CT groups respectively., CONCLUSIONS: While acute toxicity was higher compared with RT alone, this accelerated RT schedule was feasible in association with 5-FU/CDDP, even administered concomitantly. Despite the significant proportion of more advanced disease in the RT-CT group, LRC was similar to that obtained by RT alone. Combinations of concomitant boost RT and chemotherapy merit further investigation in prospective trials.",Excluded
3535,"Dosimetric coverage of the external anal sphincter by 3-dimensional conformal fields in rectal cancer patients receiving neoadjuvant chemoradiation: implications for the concept of sphincter-preserving radiation therapy. BACKGROUND: We evaluated the anatomic location of the external anal sphincter (EAS) to pelvic bony landmarks related to 3-dimensional conformal radiotherapy (3DRT) and studied the dosimetric coverage of the EAS in patients undergoing neoadjuvant chemoradiation for rectal cancer., METHODS: Sixty-four consecutive rectal cancer patients treated with neoadjuvant chemoradiation were included. All patients were treated in a prone position on a bellyboard by 3DRT. The inferior border of the RT fields was at least 3-5 cm inferior to the gross tumorous volume (GTV) or at the inferior border of the obturator foramen (IBOF), whichever was more inferior. The EAS was contoured and dose distributions were determined using dose-volume histograms., RESULTS: In 53 out of 64 cases (82.8%), the EAS was completely inferior to the IBOF. In the remaining 11 cases, the EAS was either overlapping the IBOF (10 cases; 15.6%) or completely superior to the IBOF (1 case; 1.7%). The average mean dose delivered to the EAS was 2795 cGy. Lower mean doses were delivered to the EAS when the center of the EAS was located more distant from the GTV., CONCLUSIONS: Meticulous planning to define the inferior border of the RT field is recommended to avoid irradiating the EAS.",Excluded
2525,"A phase I study of gefitinib with concurrent dose-escalated weekly docetaxel and conformal three-dimensional thoracic radiation followed by consolidative docetaxel and maintenance gefitinib for patients with stage III non-small cell lung cancer. BACKGROUND: Concurrent radiation and chemotherapy is the standard of care for good performance status patients with stage III non-small cell lung cancer. Locoregional control remains a significant factor relating to poor outcome. Preclinical and early clinical data suggest that docetaxel and gefitinib have radiosensitizing activity. This study sought to define the maximum tolerated dose of weekly docetaxel that could be given with daily gefitinib and concurrent thoracic radiation therapy., PATIENTS AND MATERIALS: Patients with histologically confirmed, inoperable stage III non-small cell lung cancer and good performance status (Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group 0-1) were eligible for this study. Patients received three-dimensional conformal thoracic radiation to a dose of 70 Gy concurrently with oral gefitinib at a dose of 250 mg daily and intravenous, weekly docetaxel at escalating doses from 15 to 30 mg/m2 in cohorts of patients. Patients were given a 2-week rest period after the concurrent therapy, during which they received only gefitinib. After the 2-week rest period, patients received consolidation chemotherapy with docetaxel 75 mg/m2 given every 21 days for two cycles. Maintenance gefitinib was continued until disease progression or study completion., RESULTS: Sixteen patients were enrolled on the study between December 2003 and April 2007 with the following characteristics: median age, 64 years (range 43-79 years); M/F: 9/7; and performance status 0/1, 1/15. Dose-limiting pulmonary toxicity and esophagitis were encountered at a weekly docetaxel dose of 25 mg/m2, resulting in a maximum tolerated dose of 20 mg/m2/wk. Overall, grade 3/4 hematologic toxicity was observed in 27% of patients. Grade 3/4 esophageal and pulmonary toxicities were reported in 27% and 20% of patients, respectively. The overall response rate was 46%, and the median survival for all patients was 21 months., CONCLUSIONS: Concurrent thoracic radiation with weekly docetaxel and daily gefitinib is feasible but results in moderate toxicity. For further studies, the recommended weekly docetaxel dose for this chemoradiation regimen is 20 mg/m2.",Excluded

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effect of 90Y-DOTATOC and 131I-MIBG in treatment of metastatic medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC). METHOD(S): Twelve histologically confirmed patients with metastatic MTC were included. All patients underwent both 111In-DTPA-octreotide imaging and 131I/ 123I-meta-iodobenzylguanidine (MIBG) imaging. According to the results of the combined imaging, positive patients were selected to be treated with 90Y-DOTA-D-Phe1-Tyr3-octreotide (90Y-DOTATOC) or 131I-MIBG, respectively. The therapeutic procedures of targeted internal radiation were performed with 3.33 GBq 90Y-DOTATOC at 6-week intervals, or 11.1 GBq 131I-MIBG with a minimum interval of three months. RESULT(S): The imaging procedure was positive in all 12 patients: 111In-DTPA-octreotide imaging in eight patients, 131I/ 123I-MIBG imaging in six patients. According to the results of combined imaging, we identified four patients to be treated with 90Y-DOTATOC, and five patients with 131 I-MIBG. After three to five sessions of treatment, three patients with partial remission and six with stable disease were observed. The effective rate was 3/9 (33.3%) and the overall tumor response rate was 9/9 (100%). No relevant toxicity was observed. CONCLUSION(S): The combined imaging technique can be used to identify patients for effective radionuclide treatment. The treatment with 90Y-DOTATOC or 131I-MIBG is well tolerated and may improve the fate of patients with metastatic MTC.",Excluded
1050,"Clinical and lung ultrasonographic features of transient tachypnea of newborn in a tertiary care hospital in Bangalore. Introduction: Transient tachypnea of the newborn (TTN) also called wet lung, occurs due to delayed clearance of lung fluid. The diagnosis of TTN was primarily based on medical history, clinical manifestations, arterial blood gas analysis, and chest radiography (CXR). It is estimated that over 70% of infants with TTN are clinically misdiagnosed with Respiratory distress syndrome (RDS). Lung ultrasound (LUS) is an emerging technique that could be used for early detection of TTN. This study aims to evaluate the value of lung ultrasound in the diagnosis of TTN in late-preterm and full-term neonates. Material(s) and Method(s): Sixty five late preterm and term neonates with signs of respiratory distress were included in this prospective observational study from January 2016 to June 2017. Lung ultrasound was done within the first 24 hours of birth and assessed according to the observation indices like A-line, B-line and Double lung point. Result(s): On lung ultrasound, 53 (81.5%) neonates showed the feature of double lung point (DLP) while 41 (63.1%) neonates showed A-line. The respiratory symptoms subsided in 38 (58.4%) babies at room air while only 2 (3.1%) babies required continuous positive airway pressure ventilation. The DLP feature on LUS was significantly more in babies born to primi mothers than multigravida (p value 0.02) and those delivered through LSCS when compared to babies delivered vaginally (p value-0.01). Conclusion(s): TTN is a self-limiting condition and treatment is mainly supportive. The results of this study further demonstrate that LUS can accurately and reliably diagnose TTN. Therefore, significantly reducing the need for chest X-rays and ultimately result in lower exposure of a neonate to ionizing radiation. This will aid in counselling the parents regarding its benign nature and conservative management. Copyright © 2019, Scientific Publishers of India. All rights reserved.",Excluded
2502,"Comparison of nodal irradiation dose using radiotherapy for patients with thoracic esophageal cancer. The present study aimed to compare incidental nodal irradiation (INI) doses using volume-modulated arc therapy (VMAT), 5-field intensity-modulated radiotherapy (5F-IMRT) and 3D-conformal radiotherapy (3D-CRT) treatment plans for patients with thoracic esophageal cancer (EC). A total of 15 patients with thoracic EC were selected for participation between October 2016 and July 2017 at the Hangzhou Cancer Hospital. Regional lymph nodal stations were contoured according to 3D CT-based images of the Japan Esophageal Society Guidelines. All patients were treated with 60 Gy using VMAT, 5F-IMRT and 3D-CRT plans. Dose-volume histograms of planning target volume (PTV), lung, heart, spinal cord and incidental nodal irradiation were compared between the three plans. 5F-IMRT was superior in PTV_V95% (the volume of the PTV receiving 95% of the prescription dose, P=0.003) and the VMAT plan was best in terms of conformal index (P=0.005). V20 and V30were reduced by 10.7-22.6% (P=0.002) and 12.8-21% (P=0.026), respectively, in normal lung tissue using the VMAT plan. 5F-IMRT demonstrated the lowest maximum dose (Dmax) for the spinal cord (P=0.037). For the INI, 3D-CRT exhibited the highest equivalent uniform dose (EUD) values for 106pre (P=0.014) and 106tb-L (P=0.03) in upper-thoracic EC. The mean EUD of all lymph nodal regions in middle-thoracic EC were >40 Gy in VMAT and 5F-IMRT plans; the VMAT plan had higher EUD values in lower-thoracic EC compared with 5F-IMRT, 3D-CRT plans for INI. VMAT were comparable to the 5F-IMRT plan with respect to dosimetric characteristics for planning and INI doses to thoracic nodal levels NO 105-112 are considerable for thoracic EC.Copyright © 2020 Spandidos Publications.

1113,"Improved local control for early T-stage nasopharyngeal carcinoma--a tale of two hospitals. PURPOSE: To study the efficacy of intracavitary brachytherapy (ICT) in early T-stage nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC)., METHODS AND MATERIALS: All early T-stage (T1 and T2 nasal cavity tumour) NPC treated with a curative intent up to 1996 were analyzed (n=743), 163 from the Prince of Wales Hospital (PWH) and 25 from Tuen Mun Hospital (TMH) were given ICT after radical external radiotherapy (ERT; group A). They were compared with 555 patients treated with ERT alone (group B). The radiotherapy techniques were identical between the two hospitals. The ERT delivered the tumoricidal dose (uncorrected biological equivalent dose (BED)-10, > or = 75 Gy) to the primary tumour, and this did not differ in technique or dosage between the two groups. The ICT delivered a dose of 18-24 Gy in three fractions over 15 days to a point 1 cm perpendicular to the midpoint of the plane of the sources., RESULTS: The local failure was significantly less (crude rates, 6.9 vs. 13.0%; 5-year actuarial rates, 5.8 vs. 11.7%) and the disease-specific mortality was significantly lower (crude rates, 13.8 vs. 18.9%; 5-year actuarial rates, 12.2 vs. 15.2%) in group A compared with group B. ICT was the only significant independent prognostic factor predictive of fewer local failures. When ICT was excluded from the Cox regression model, the total physical dose or the total BED-10 uncorrected for tumour repopulation became significant in predicting the ultimate local failure rate. The two groups were comparable in the rate of the chronic radiation complications. A significant dose-tumour-control relationship existed, plotting the local failure as a function of the total physical dose or the total BED., CONCLUSIONS: Supplementing ERT, which delivered the tumoricidal dose (uncorrected BED-10, > or = 75 Gy), with ICT significantly enhanced ultimate local control in early T-stage (T1/T2 nasal infiltration) NPC. A significant dose-tumour-control relationship exists above the conventional tumoricidal dose level.",Excluded
774,"The diagnosis of acute urethral trauma. Background: During trauma resuscitation, blind catheterization of an injured urethra may aggravate the injury by disrupting a partially torn urethra. In busy trauma centers, retrograde urethrograms (RUG) prior to catheterisation for all patients with unstable pelvic fractures presents a challenge during trauma resuscitation, and the procedure is not commonly practiced despite Advanced Trauma Life Support (ATLS) and World Health Organisation recommendations. The aim of this study was to determine the presenting clinical features of patients with urethral injuries and to predict major trauma patients needing further investigation to exclude this injury. Method(s): A retrospective review of adult major trauma patients diagnosed with urethral injuries during an 8-year period at a major trauma centre, was conducted. Result(s): There were 998 major trauma patients with fractures of the pelvis over the study period, of whom 223 had pubic symphysis disruption. There were 29 patients with urethral injuries. The sensitivity of any one of the traditional signs of urethral trauma was 66.7% (95% CI: 46.0-82.8). After exclusion of patients with penetrating trauma and iatrogenic injuries, pubic symphysis disruption on initial pelvis AP X-ray and/or the clinical signs of urethral injury had a sensitivity of 100% (95% CI: 84.4-100.0) for urethral trauma. Discussion(s): Reliance on clinical features alone to predict urethral injury results in a substantial proportion of missed injuries in major trauma patients. RUGs did not appear to be needed in patients with no disruption of the pubic symphysis on initial pelvis X-ray or where no signs of urethral injury are present. In the absence of clinical signs and pubic symphysis disruption, blind urethral catheterisation may be attempted. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.",Excluded
3345,"Validity of sentinel lymph node (SLN) detection following adjuvant radiochemotherapy (RCT) in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC). The effect of preoperative radio chemotherapy on lymphatic drainage and intraoperative gamma probe-guided sentinel lymph node detection has yet not been investigated. In this study, we study 13 patients with SCC. Sentinel lymph node (SLN) imaging of the patients was performed using SPECT-CT. Special care was taken to use identical injection sites for both studies. Imaging comprised planar and SPECT, iterative reconstruction and were viewed with the co-registered CT image. The results were validated by comparison with the histological results of intraoperative gamma probe detection and histology of the completed neck dissection. Identical SLNs were found in 6/13 patients. In 2/13 cases SLN biopsies were false-negative. In 4/13 patients preoperative SLN imaging identified more/additional nodes than the initial imaging, whereas fewer nodes were seen in 3/13 patients. Neither the primary tumor site nor the TNM stage was predictive for changes in the lymphatic drainage pattern. No constant effect of irradiation could be demonstrated. Preoperative radio chemotherapy has an unpredictable influence on the lymphatic drainage pattern in HNSCC.

Thus, we advise fused functional/anatomical imaging (SPECT-CT) before and after radiochemotherapy if the SLN concept is utilized in HNSCC.",Excluded
1481,"Influence of postoperative low-level laser therapy on the osseointegration of self-tapping implants in the posterior maxilla: A 6-week split-mouth clinical study. Background/Aim. Low-level laser therapy (LLLT) has been proven to stimulate bone repair, affecting cellular prolifera-tion, differentiation and adhesion, and has shown a potential to reduce the healing time following implant placement. The aim of this clinical study was to investigate the influence of postoperative LLLT osseointegration and early success of self-tapping implants placed into low-density bone. Meth-ods. Following the split-mouth design, self-tapping implants (n = 44) were inserted in the posterior maxilla of 12 patients. One jaw side randomly received LLLT (test group), while the other side was placebo (control group). For LLLT, a 637 nm gallium-aluminum-arsenide (GaAlAs) laser (Medicolaser 637, Technoline, Belgrade, Serbia) with an output power of 40 mW and continuous wave was used. Low-level laser treat-ment was performed immediately after the surgery and then repeated every day in the following 7 days. The total irradia-tion dose per treatment was 6.26 J/cm2 per implant. The study outcomes were: implant stability, alkaline-phosphatase (ALP) activity and early implant success rate. The follow-up took 6 weeks. Results. Irradiated implants achieved a higher stability compared with controls during the entire follow-up and the difference reached significance in the 5th postoperative week (paired t-test, p = 0.030). The difference in ALP activ-ity between the groups was insignificant in any observation point (paired t-test, p > 0.05). The early implant success rate was 100%, regardless of LLLT usage. Conclusion. LLLT applied daily during the first postoperative week expressed no significant influence on the osseointegration of self-tapping implants placed into low density bone of the poste-rior maxilla. Placement of self-tapping macro-designed im-plants into low density bone could be a predictable thera-peutic procedure with a high early success rate regardless of LLLT usage.Copyright © 2015, Institut za Vojnomedicinske Naucne Informacije/Documentaciju.

2962,"Clinical usefulness of the novel tag-less Pillcam patency capsule for the screening of patients with suspected small bowel strictures. BACKGROUND:Capsule endoscopy (CE) is a non-invasive diagnostic tool for the study of the small bowel. The main complication of CE is capsule retention, defined as a failure to excrete the capsule for 2 weeks or more requiring directed medical, endoscopic, or surgical intervention. Due to the risk of capsule retention, CE is contraindicated in patients with suspected small bowel strictures. The novel tag-less PillCam Patency Capsule (PPC) for preventing capsule retention which was marketed in 2012 in Japan has expanded the indication of small bowel disease for CE. OBJECTIVE(S):We investigated the safety and clinical usefulness of the novel tag-less PillCam Patency Capsule for preventing capsule retention in patients with suspected small bowel strictures. PATIENTS AND METHODS:Sixteen patients who suspected small bowel strictures were included (mean age: 66.2) in this retrospective study. If patients had already excreted the intact PPC in the stool at 30 h after ingestion of PPC, patency of the small bowel was confirmed. If the confirmation at 30 h was not successful, reconfirmation was performed by abdominal X-ray and/or computed tomography (CT) within 33 hours after the ingestion. If the intact PPC had reached to colon, we judged patency"". Except for the above-mentioned, we judged ""no patency"". If patency was established, then the patients underwent CE. RESULT(S):Male/Female (8/8). Clinical indications before the PPC were melena or hematochezia (6), abdominal pain (3), abdominal distension (2), abdominal mass (4) constipation (1), diarrhea (1), anemia (2), no abdominal symptom (4). A history of abdominal surgery +/- (4/12). A history of abdominal irradiation +/- (5/11). Fourteen cases (87.5%) had complete PPC examination followed by CE within 2 weeks. We judged 2 cases ""no patency"". Each of two cases showed the symptoms of ileus. One case needed ileus tube insertion and gastrografin enema showed stricture. In another case, gastric tube was inserted. In both cases, the ileus improved after conservative treatment. Fourteen patients underwent CE following the patency capsule examination. In 10 cases (71.4%) of them, the significant pathologic findings were found by CE. Although the confirmation of the patency by PPC was established, retention occurred in one case with asymptomatic. The patient had prior operation history of ileum-transverse colon bypass. CONCLUSION(S):Passage is a direct proof of the patency of small bowel. The tag-less PillCam Patency Capsule was useful to evaluate the patency of the small bowel to confirm the safer capsule endoscopy in patients with suspected small bowel strictures. However, the PPC itself may show the symptoms of ileus. The cases with abdominal surgical history could be a risk for capsule retention even though PillCam Patency Capsule confirmed the patency.""",Excluded
2809,"Evaluation of focal thyroid lesions incidentally detected in F- 18 fluorodeoxyglucose PET/CT images. AIM: Increased uptake in the thyroid gland (TG) is often identified as an incidental finding on whole-body F-18 Fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography/computed tomography (FDG-PET/CT) in the non-thyroid cancer (NTC) patients. Currently, there is no consensus on the appropriate approach for management of these cases. Thyroid ultrasound, scintigraphy and fine-needle aspiration biopsy (FNAB) are suggested to exclude malignant thyroid lesions. Our aim is to determine the importance of increased F-18 FDG uptake in TG on PET/CT in patients who are being screened for various NTC and to recommend a diagnostic strategy to identify patients with high risk of thyroid malignancy. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We evaluated 1086 cases undergoing whole-body PET/CT scan between April 2011 and April 2012. Images with incidental focal FDG uptake in TG were identified. Data of the age, sex, type of primary cancer, maximum standard uptake value (SUVmax), size of thyroid nodules and cervical lymph nodes (CLN) on F-18 FDG-PET/CT images, and if avalaible, FNAB results were evaluated. RESULT(S): 28 of 1086 patients (2.5%) showed a focal increased F-18 FDG uptake of lesions in TG (14 men, 14 women, mean age+/-SD, 60.29+/-13 years) and the SUVmax value ranged from 1.50 to 18.00 (average SUVmax: 4.19+/-3.41). Thyroid lesions ranged in diameter from 7.0 to 55.0 milimeter (mean+/-SD:16.47+/-11.80mm). The CLN were detected in 11/28 patients (39%). The average SUVmax in CLN was 4.04+/-1.80, the mean CLN diameter was 10.13+/-2.95mm. Twelve of 28 patients (43%) were done FNAB, and the final histopathological diagnosis was malign thyroid nodules in five patient (avarage SUVmax 6.84+/-6.37 and nodule diameter 31.26+/-22.11mm), benign thyroid disease in five patient (avarage SUVmax 3.95+/-1.48 and nodule diameter 9.60+/-2.30mm) and limited and unsufficient materials in two patients. Sixteen patients did not undergo any diagnostic test. CONCLUSION(S): Focal increased FDG uptake in TG incidentally identified on FDG-PET/CT occurred at a frequency of 2.5% and this finding may be associated with an increased risk of malignancy, but the clinical significance is unclear. More data are needed to elucidate the role of SUV in the differentiation of benign and malign thyroid lesions. Clinicians should take into consideration incidentally detected PET/CT findings. Thyroid scintigraphy and, if cold nodule is present, FNAB should be suggested to clinicians for definitive diagnosis.",Excluded
646,"What do we know about ALARA? Is our knowledge sufficient about radiation safety?. BACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to determine the knowledge of neurosurgeons and emergency physicians about ALARA (as low as reasonably achievable) and to gain awareness to them about this topic., METHODS: A multiple-choice survey comprising 17 questions was performed to 30 neurosurgeons and 70 emergency room doctors., RESULTS: Emergency medicine doctors, neurosurgeons, emergency medicine residents, neurosurgery residents and general practitioners participated in the survey. Sixty-six percent of participants stated that they examined more than 50 patient with headache, dizziness and head trauma in emergency service per diem and more than half of the participants stated that brain CT was performed in the event of patient's request, even if there was not an indication. 75% of the participants stated that they requested CT scan without neurological examination when the number of patients increased in the emergency room. Eighty-three percent of the participants did not think there was a safe dose limit in CT, 92% did not know the radiation dose received during brain CT, 96% did not know the meaning of the ALARA. Fifty-seven percent of the participants stated that if they informed about the criteria of ALARA, they will take into acount these criteria while requesting CT scan., CONCLUSIONS: In our country, doctors working in emergency services request brain CT needlessly because of taking into account the patient's wish and fear of malpractice. The knowledge of the neurosurgeons and emergency service doctors about ALARA is insufficient. It is necessary to educate our physicians about ALARA protocol, for taking these criteria into their consideration when requesting CT examination. For protecting the patients from the effects of ionizing radiation and reducing the economic loss of hospitals, it is necessary to increase awareness of the ALARA protocol and to increase the number of hospitals which protocol is applied.",Excluded
2806,"Kidney-sparing radiotherapy by multiple-field three-dimensional technique in the postoperative management of patients with gastric cancer: Comparison with standard two-field conformal technique. Aims and background: The opposed two-field technique is the standard approach for delivering adjuvant radiotherapy to patients with resected gastric cancer. Since a considerable radiation dose may reach both kidneys with this beam arrangement, with a potential risk of late effects, we investigated whether the CT-based multiple-field (M-F) approach was superior in terms of sparing critical organs at risk. Method(s): From March 2001 to March 2004, 19 patients with radically resected gastric cancer entered the study. They were treated with adjuvant chemoradiotherapy according to the INT 0116 protocol. For each patient dose-volume histograms were calculated and the volume values of both kidneys and liver receiving 25 Gy (V25), 30 Gy (V30) and 40 Gy (V40) individually estimated with the M-F and two-field techniques were compared in detail. Result(s): Right kidney median V25, V30 and V40 values for the two-field and M-F techniques were 1.50%, 0%, 0% and 0%, 0% and 0%, respectively (P <0.005, P <0.01, P <0.05). Left kidney median V25, V30 and V40 values for the M-F and two-field technique were 16%, 9.80%, 0.90% and 33.20%, 30.20%, 21.40% (P <0.001, P <0.0005, P <0.0005). Liver median V25, V30 and V40 values for the M-F and two-field techniques were 51.30%, 22.30%, 8.90% and 13.30%, 11.60%, 8.10%, respectively (P <0.0001, P <0.0005 and P = 0.18). Conclusion(s): Our comparison revealed that with the multiple-field technique the right kidney may be largely spared from irradiation; with respect to the two-field technique, the left kidney may receive a significantly reduced dose; however, the liver receives an increased dose that warrants careful long-term monitoring of hepatic function.",Excluded
1807,"Relation between clinical mature and immature lymphocyte cells in human peripheral blood and their spatial label free scattering patterns. A single living cell's light scattering pattern (LSP) in the horizontal plane, which has been denoted as the cell's ""2D fingerprint,"" may provide a powerful label-free detection tool in clinical applications. We have recently studied the LSP in spatial scattering planes, denoted as the cell's ""3D fingerprint,"" for mature and immature lymphocyte cells in human peripheral blood. The effects of membrane size, morphology, and the existence of the nucleus on the spatial LSP are discussed. In order to distinguish clinical label-free mature and immature lymphocytes, the special features of the spatial LSP are studied by statistical method in both the spatial and frequency domains. Spatial LSP provides rich information on the cell's morphology and contents, which can distinguish mature from immature lymphocyte cells and hence ultimately it may be a useful label-free technique for clinical leukemia diagnosis.",Excluded
1573,"Safety and feasibility of robotic percutaneous coronary intervention: PRECISE (percutaneous robotically-enhanced coronary intervention) study. Objectives: The aim of this study was to evaluate the safety as well as the clinical and technical effectiveness of robotic-assisted percutaneous coronary intervention. Background(s): Robotic systems have been suggested to enhance the performance of cardiovascular procedures, as well as to provide protection from the occupational hazards that are associated with interventional practice. Method(s): Patients with coronary artery disease and clinical indications for percutaneous intervention were enrolled. The coronary intervention was performed with the CorPath 200 robotic system, which consists of a remote interventional cockpit and a bedside disposable cassette that enables the operator to advance, retract, and rotate guidewires and catheters. The primary endpoints were clinical procedural success, defined as <30% residual stenosis at the completion of the robotic-assisted procedure without major adverse cardiovascular events within 30 days, and device technical success, defined as the successful manipulation of the intracoronary devices using the robotic system only. Result(s): A total of 164 patients were enrolled at 9 sites. Percutaneous coronary intervention was completed successfully without conversion to manual operation, and device technical success was achieved in 162 of 164 patients (98.8%). There were no device-related complications. Clinical procedural success was achieved in 160 of 164 patients (97.6%), whereas 4 (2.4%) had periprocedural non-Q-wave myocardial infarctions. No deaths, strokes, Q-wave myocardial infarctions, or revascularization occurred in the 30 days after the procedures. Radiation exposure for the primary operator was 95.2% lower than the levels found at the traditional table position. Conclusion(s): This pivotal multicenter study with a robotic-enhanced coronary intervention system demonstrated the safety and feasibility of the system. The robotic remote-control procedure met the expected technical and clinical performance, with significantly lower radiation exposure to the operator.

1296,"Selective internal radiation therapy for liver malignancies. BACKGROUND: Selective internal radiation therapy (SIRT) is a non-ablative technique for the treatment of liver primaries and metastases, with the intention of reducing tumour bulk. This study aimed to determine optimal patient selection, and elucidate its role as a downsizing modality., METHODS: Data were collected retrospectively on patients who underwent SIRT between 2011 and 2014. The procedure was performed percutaneously by an expert radiologist. Response was analysed in two categories, based on radiological (CT/MRI according to Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumours (RECIST)) and biological (alpha-fetoprotein, carcinoembryonic antigen, carbohydrate antigen 19-9, chromogranin A) parameters., RESULTS: Forty-four patients were included. Liver metastases from colorectal cancer (22 patients) and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) (9) were the most common pathologies. Radiological response data were collected from 31 patients. A reduction in sum of diameters (SOD) was observed in patients with HCC (median -24.1 (95 per cent c.i. -43.4 to -3.8) per cent) and neuroendocrine tumours (-30.0 (-45.6 to -7.7) per cent), whereas a slight increase in SOD was seen in patients with colorectal cancer (4.9 (-10.6 to 55.3) per cent). Biological response was assessed in 17 patients, with a reduction in 12, a mixed response in two and no improvement in three. Six- and 12-month overall survival rates were 71 and 41 per cent respectively. There was no difference in overall survival between the RECIST response groups (median survival 375, 290 and 214 days for patients with a partial response, stable disease and progressive disease respectively; P = 0.130), or according to primary pathology (P = 0.063). Seven patients underwent liver resection with variable responses after SIRT., CONCLUSION: SIRT may be used to downsize tumours and may be used as a bridge to surgery in patients with tumours deemed borderline for resection.

Purpose: Percutaneous nephrolithotomy is generally performed using fluoroscopy, which is associated with exposure to radiation. Another drawback of fluoroscopic guided percutaneous nephrolithotomy is the prone position, which is not suitable for all patients. In this study we evaluated the feasibility, safety and efficacy of ultrasound guided percutaneous nephrolithotomy with the patient in the flank position. Material(s) and Method(s): A total of 603 patients with a mean +/- SD age of 50.9 +/- 13 years were included in this study from December 2010 to July 2016. Access to the collecting system and tract dilation were performed under ultrasound guidance. Perioperative data on the stone-free rate, operative time, length of stay and complication rates were recorded. Result(s): Successful access was achieved in all but 1 patient. Mean operative time was 56.6 +/- 6.5 minutes. Complete stone clearance was achieved in 529 patients (87.7%) and Clavien-Dindo grade 3 complications were noted in 17 (2.8%). Blood transfusion was necessary in 43 patients (7.1%). However, bleeding was self-limited in all cases and did not require angioembolization. Conclusion(s): To our knowledge this is the largest series of ultrasound guided percutaneous nephrolithotomy with the patient in the flank position. Unlike in other studies we used this procedure in all patients irrespective of stone burden, renal anomaly and body habitus. Ultrasound guided percutaneous nephrolithotomy has outcomes comparable to those of conventional percutaneous nephrolithotomy and it is not associated with radiation exposure. Furthermore, anesthesia while in the flank position might be less harmful in some patients, including those with obesity or cardiopulmonary comorbidities.Copyright © 2018 American Urological Association Education and Research, Inc.",Excluded

Background: To assess inter-observer variability in delineating target volume and organs at risk in benign tumor adjacent to optic tract as a quality assurance exercise. Method(s): We quantitatively analyzed 21 plans made by 11 clinicians in seven CyberKnife centers. The clinicians were provided with a raw data set (pituitary adenoma and meningioma) including clinical information, and were asked to delineate the lesions and create a treatment plan. Their contouring and plans (10 adenoma and 11 meningioma plans), were then compared. In addition, we estimated the influence of differences in contouring by superimposing the respective contours onto a default plan. Result(s): The median planning target volume (PTV) and the ratio of the largest to the smallest contoured volume were 9.22 cm3 (range, 7.17 - 14.3 cm3) and 1.99 for pituitary adenoma, and 6.86 cm3 (range 6.05 - 14.6 cm3) and 2.41 for meningioma. PTV volume was 10.1 +/- 1.74 cm3 for group 1 with a margin of 1 -2 mm around the CTV (n = 3) and 9.28 +/- 1.8 cm3(p = 0.51) for group 2 with no margin (n = 7) in pituitary adenoma. In meningioma, group 1 showed larger PTV volume (10.1 +/- 3.26 cm3) than group 2 (6.91 +/- 0.7 cm3, p = 0.03). All submitted plan keep the irradiated dose to optic tract within the range of 50 Gy (equivalent total doses in 2 Gy fractionation). However, contours superimposed onto the dose distribution of the default plan indicated that an excessive dose 23.64 Gy (up to 268% of the default plan) in pituitary adenoma and 24.84 Gy (131% of the default plan) in meningioma to the optic nerve in the contours from different contouring.

The accumulating effects of exposure to electromagnetic radiation emitted by a conventional mobile phone (MP) on male sexual behaviour have not yet been analyzed. Therefore, we studied these effects in 18 male rabbits that were randomly divided into phone and control groups. Six female teasers were taken successively to the male's cage and the copulatory behavior was recorded. Serum total testosterone, dopamine and cortisol were evaluated. The animals of the phone group were exposed to MPs (800 MHz) in a standby position for 8 h daily for 12 weeks. At the end of the study, the copulatory behavior and hormonal assays were re-evaluated. Mounts without ejaculation were the main mounts in the phone group and its duration and frequency increased significantly compared with the controls, whereas the reverse was observed in its mounts with ejaculation. Ejaculation frequency dropped significantly, biting/grasping against teasers increased notably and mounting latency in accumulated means from the first to the fourth teasers were noted in the phone group. The hormonal assays did not show any significant differences between the study groups. Therefore, the pulsed radiofrequency emitted by a conventional MP, which was kept on a standby position, could affect the sexual behavior in the rabbit.",Excluded

Introduction: Posterior spinal fusion (PSF) and correction is the most frequently performed surgery in Scheuermann-associated hyperkyphosis. The aim of the study was to assess the extent of kyphosis correction, complications and clinical outcome after PSF. Material/Methods: Between 2014 and 2018, 73 patients with Scheuermann associated hyperkyphosis underwent surgery, were prospectively recorded and retrospectively analyzed. X-rays of the whole spine were analyzed pre- and postoperative as well as after 6, 12 and 24 months. Sagittal and coronary Cobb angles, pelvic parameters and sagittal profile were evaluated using a web-based analysis tool. Operation duration, complications, and blood loss were compared. Postoperatively, the clinical outcome was determined using standardized questionnaires (SRS22, EQ 5D) after 3, 12 and 24 months. Result(s): Thoracic structural kyphosis (UEV-LEV) was preoperatively measured with 75.11degree with a correction to 48.54degree (p<0.001). The Stagnara angles had an extent of 68.87degree with a correction to 38.68degree (p<0.001). Compensatory lumbar lordosis (LL) showed a correction from 68.24degree to 46.70degree (p<0.001). Using the highly negative pelvic incidence (PI) - LL mismatch (PI-LL pre-OP - 23.6 to PI-LL post-OP -1.3; p<0.001) we demonstrated significant compensatory hyperlordosis pre-OP with good spontaneous correction post-OP. The number of fused segments (11.2) correlated significantly with the degree of kyphosis (p<0.005) and kyphosis correction (p<0.001). The pelvic parameters (PI, pelvic tilt, sacral slope) were physiologically preoperatively and without changes in the follow-up X-rays. The most frequently uppermost and lowest instrumented vertebra was T2 (33 patients, 45.2%) and L3 (29 patients, 39.7%), respectively. Number of fused segments correlated significantly with surgery duration (mean 263.73 min, p=0.012) and blood loss (mean 750.56 ml, p=0.016). The initial degree of kyphosis showed significant correlation with the SRS mental health subscore(p=0.043). The degree of kyphosis had no influence on the other subscores and on the total SRS 22. Furthermore, the clinical outcome showed a gradual and significant improvement of SRS 22 and EQ 5D after 3 and 12 months. Postoperatively we recorded the following complications: neurological complication without neurological deficit (3.2%), implant-associated complication (6.3%) and wound healing issues (3.2%). Discussion(s): Using PSF we corrected the thoracic hyperkyphosis of M. Scheuermann from 75degree to 48degree and the lumbar hyperlordosis from 68degree to 47degree. We could achieve an almost physiological reconstruction of the sagittal alignment. The first clinical followup results were convincing with a significant improvement of SRS 22 and the EQ 5D already after 3 months. Complication rates were moderate (14.2%) and the risk of proximal junctional kyphosis with sufficiently long instrumentation after PSF alone is rare with 1.6% of cases.",Excluded
287,"Comparison of three dosimetric techniques to take in account lung tumor motion: Gating-like technique results lead to advice the use of gating device even in the cases of pre-operative irradiation. Purpose: Comparison of three dosimetric techniques of lung tumor delineation to integrate tumor motion during breathing. Patients and Methods: Nineteen patients with T1-3N0M0 malignant lung tumor were treated with definitive chemoradiotherapy (14 cases) or pre-surgery chemoradiation. Doses were, respectively, 66 and 46 Gy. CT-scan for delineation was performed during three phases of breathing: free breathing and deep breath-hold inspiration and expiration. GTV (gross tumor volume) was delineated on the three sequences. The classic technique included GTV from the free-breathing sequence plus a CTV (clinical target volume) margin of 5 to 8 mm plus a PTV (planning target volume) margin of 7 to 10 mm (including ITV [internal target volume] margin and set-up margin). The gating-like technique included GTV from the deep breath-hold inspiration sequence plus a CTV margin of 5 to 8 mm plus a PTV margin of 2 mm. The three-volume technique, included GTV as a result of the fusion of GTVs from the three sequences plus a CTV margin of 5 to 8 mm plus a PTV margin of 2 mm. Dosimetry was calculated for the three PTVs, if possible, with the same fields number and position. Dose constraints and rules were imposed to accept dosimetries: firstly spinal cord maximal dose less than 45 Gy, followed by V95 % for PTV greater than or equal to 95 %, and V20 GYGy for lung less than or equal to 30 %, V30 GYGy for lung less than or equal to 20 %. Result(s): GTVs were not statistically different between the three methods of delineation. PTVs were significantly lower with the gating-like technique. V95% of the PTV were not different between the three techniques. With the classic-, the gating-like- and the 3-volume techniques, dosimetry was considered as acceptable, respectively in 15, 18 and 15 cases. Comparisons of constraint values showed that the gating-like method gave the best results. In the case of pre-operative management, the gating-like method allowed the best results even for the V95% values. However, in the absence of gating device or without the possibility to use it, the 3-volume method allowed to take into account more precisely the organ motion than the classical technique. Conclusion(s): The 3-volume method can be done. It is a good method to take into account the organ motions. However, the gating-like method gives the best results leading to propose its use even for pre-operative patients with upper tumors. © 2009.",Excluded

To assess the diagnostic accuracy of prospective ECG-triggering 64-slice multidetector computed tomography (MDCT) coronary angiography for evaluation of coronary artery disease (CAD). Forty-two patients (31 males, 11 females, mean age 64 years) underwent cardiac CT and invasive coronary angiography (ICA). Patients with a heart rate of <65 beats/min with stable heart rhythm were included in the study sample. We used a prospective ECG-triggering protocol. Luminal narrowing over 50% was considered to be significant according to a modified 17-segment AHA model, using invasive coronary angiography (ICA) as the standard of reference. The mean radiation dose was 3.5 mSv +/- 0.3 (range, 3.3-4.2 mSv), and 542 of 549 segments (98.7%) in the 42 patients were diagnostic.

3479,"An essential role for Drosophila hus1 in somatic and meiotic DNA damage responses. The checkpoint proteins Rad9, Rad1 and Hus1 form a clamp-like complex which plays a central role in the DNA-damage-induced checkpoint response. Here we address the function of the 9-1-1 complex in Drosophila. We decided to focus our analysis on the meiotic and somatic requirements of hus1. For that purpose, we created a null allele of hus1 by imprecise excision of a P element found 2 kb from the 3' of the hus1 gene. We found that hus1 mutant flies are viable, but the females are sterile. We determined that hus1 mutant flies are sensitive to hydroxyurea and methyl methanesulfonate but not to X-rays, suggesting that hus1 is required for the activation of an S-phase checkpoint. We also found that hus1 is not required for the G2-M checkpoint and for post-irradiation induction of apoptosis. We subsequently studied the role of hus1 in activation of the meiotic checkpoint and found that the hus1 mutation suppresses the dorsal-ventral pattering defects caused by mutants in DNA repair enzymes. Interestingly, we found that the hus1 mutant exhibits similar oocyte nuclear defects as those produced by mutations in DNA repair enzymes. These results demonstrate that hus1 is essential for the activation of the meiotic checkpoint and that hus1 is also required for the organization of the oocyte DNA, a function that might be independent of the meiotic checkpoint.",Excluded

However, ypTNM stage, especially ypN stage does not predict patient survival after NCRT well. Whether tumor regression in lymph nodes (LRG) may improve the prediction has not been well studied. In total, 358 patients with rectal cancer who received NCRT followed by radical resection were recruited from 2004 to 2015, and the median follow-up time was 57.5 months. The main outcome measure was disease-free survival (DFS). In univariate analysis, factors associated with DFS were ypT stage, ypN stage, number of negative lymph nodes (NLN), lymph node ratio (LNR), tumor regression grade (TRG), M-TTRG (modified ypT stage by combining ypT stage and TRG), maximum LRG (LRGmax), sum score of LRG (LRGsum), LRG ratio (average value of LRGsum), and M-NLRG (modified ypN stage by combining LRGmax and LNR). In the multivariate Cox regression analysis, M-TTRG and M-NLRG (p < 0.001 and p = 0.030, respectively) were significantly associated with DFS. The estimated 5-year DFS rates were 86.6%, 60.3%, and 36.4% for patients with M-NLRG-0, M-NLRG-1, and M-NLRG-2, respectively (p < 0.001). A significant difference in survival was observed among patients with NCRT after incorporating TRG and LRG simultaneously into the current ypTNM staging system (p < 0.001). LRG was an important prognostic factor in rectal cancer patients treated with NCRT and could refine the ypTNM staging system. The modified ypTNM staging system in combination with LRGmax, LNR, and TRG could improve the DFS prediction in each subset of patients.Copyright © 2020 The Authors.

3546,"Dosimetric study of intensity modulated arc therapy for total marrow irradiation. Purpose/Objective(s): In recent years, helical tomotherapy has been used for total bone marrow irradiation for sparing of critical organs. In this study, we evaluated the efficacy of intensity-modulated arc therapy (IMAT) for total bone marrow irradiation. Materials/Methods: Three patients who received total marrow irradiation with helical tomotherapy, two females and one male, were selected for this dosimetric study. Each patient had one CT scan with normal breathing from the skull to the mid-thigh, and two CT scans at the end of the expiration and inspiration phases. Contours for target volumes and normal organs were drawn to take into account breathing effects. The target volumes included the bone volume from the skull to the mid-thigh, lymph nodes, and spleen. 12 Gy in 8 fractions was prescribed to the target volumes. Varian RapidArc IMAT plans were generated with the same target volumes as the helical tomotherapy plans. For each patient, 23 normal structures were included in plan optimization, including all the major organs in the body. In helical tomotherapy plans, 5 cm jaw width was used. For IMAT planning, eight arc fields were used for each patient to cover the entire target volumes, with the isocenters aligned along the superior-inferior axis. Both the helical tomotherapy and IMAT plans were normalized to cover 85% of the bone volume by 12 Gy. Result(s): The average values of themean doses to the normal organswere 6.0 Gy, 6.0 Gy, and 5.8Gy in helical tomotherapy plans for the three patients; they were 4.8 Gy, 5.4 Gy, and 5.2 Gy, respectively, in IMAT plans. Of the 63 organs that could be compared pairwise, 43 had lower means using IMATand 17 had lowermeans using tomotherapy.Of the 40 organ pairs whose mean doses differed bymore than 10%, 33 had lower means in IMAT plans.D10 (theminimumdose level covering 10%of the volume) for the bone volume were 13.5 Gy, 13.1 Gy, and 13.5 Gy in helical tomotherapy plans for the three patients, respectively; they were 13.7 Gy, 14.4Gy, and 14.3Gy in IMAT plans. Comparable dose coveragewas achieved by IMAT plans for other target volumes. The average beam-on timewas 19.4minutes for helical tomotherapy and approximately 16 minutes for IMAT. Planning time excluding contouring was approximately 4h for each method. The average monitor unit (MU) in helical tomotherapy plans was 17,207 MU; it was 4,916 MU in IMAT plans. Conclusion(s): Compared to helical tomotherapy plans, IMAT plans showed consistent improvement in sparing of normal organs while delivering a somewhat less homogeneous dose to the target volumes for total bone marrow irradiation. This study indicates that IMAT can be used effectively for total bone marrow irradiation. With either treatment lower extremities are most efficiently treated with conventional open fields.",Excluded
1492,"Environmental radioactivity and high incidence rates of stomach and esophagus cancer in the Van Lake Region: A causal relationship?. This study examined the incidence rates of cancer cases (averages for 2006-2010) and relationships with environmental radioactivity levels. Soil and water samples were collected from provincial and district centers of Van city and the outdoor gamma doses were determined using a portable gamma scintillation detector. Gross alpha and beta, (226)Ra, (232)Th, and (40)K activities were measured in both tap water and soil samples. Although high rates of stomach and esophagus cancers have been reported previously in Van the underlying reasons have not hitherto been defined. Incidences of cancers were highest in the Gurpinar (326.0) and Ozalp (377.1) counties (p<0.001). As to the results of the gross alpha and gross beta radioactivity measurements in the drinking water, these two counties also had high beta radionuclide levels: Gurpinar (140 mBq/dm3) and Ozalp (206 mBq/dm3). Even if within the normal range, a relation between the higher rate of the incidence of stomach and esophagus cancers with that of the higher rate of beta radionuclide activity was clear. On Spearman correlation analysis, the relation between higher beta radionuclide levels and cancer incidence was found to be statistically significant (p<0.01). According to the results of the analysis, Van residents receive an average 1.86 mSv/y annual dose from outdoor gamma radiation, ingestion of radionuclides in the drinking water, and indoor 222Rn activity. Moreover, gross alpha and beta activities were found to be extremely high in all of the lakes around the city of Van, Turkey. Further investigations with long-term detailed environmental radiation measurements are needed regarding the relationship between cancer cases and environmental radioactivity in the city of Van.",Excluded
3320,"Effects of parental radiation exposure on developmental instability in grasshoppers. Mutagenic and epigenetic effects of environmental stressors and their transgenerational consequences are of interest to evolutionary biologists because they can amplify natural genetic variation. We studied the effect of parental exposure to radioactive contamination on offspring development in lesser marsh grasshopper Chorthippus albomarginatus. We used a geometric morphometric approach to measure fluctuating asymmetry (FA), wing shape and wing size. We measured time to sexual maturity to check whether parental exposure to radiation influenced offspring developmental trajectory and tested effects of radiation on hatching success and parental fecundity. Wings were larger in early maturing individuals born to parents from high radiation sites compared to early maturing individuals from low radiation sites. As time to sexual maturity increased, wing size decreased but more sharply in individuals from high radiation sites. Radiation exposure did not significantly affect FA or shape in wings nor did it significantly affect hatching success and fecundity. Overall, parental radiation exposure can adversely affect offspring development and fitness depending on developmental trajectories although the cause of this effect remains unclear. We suggest more direct measures of fitness and the inclusion of replication in future studies to help further our understanding of the relationship between developmental instability, fitness and environmental stress.

1926,"Altered proliferation and differentiation of human epidermis in cases of skin fibrosis after radiotherapy. PURPOSE: To characterize, at the histopathologic and molecular levels, the irradiated epidermis in cases of human skin fibrosis induced by radiotherapy., METHODS AND MATERIALS: Surgical samples were obtained from 6 patients who had developed cutaneous fibronecrotic lesions from 7 months to 27 years after irradiation. The proliferation and differentiation status of the irradiated epidermis was characterized with specific markers using immunohistochemical methods., RESULTS: All samples presented with hyperplasia of the epidermis associated with local inflammation. The scar epidermis exhibited an increased expression of proliferating cell nuclear antigen, which revealed hyperproliferation of keratinocytes. Furthermore, an abnormal differentiation was found, characterized by the expression of K6 and K16, and by alterations in protein amounts and localization of cytokeratins, involucrin, and transforming growth factor-beta1., CONCLUSION: These results demonstrate that late damage of irradiated skin is not only characterized by fibrosis in the dermis but also by hyperplasia in the epidermis. This hyperplasia was due to both hyperproliferation and abnormal differentiation of keratinocytes.",Excluded
2232,"Breaking bad: Chromothripsis and malignancy in CNS tumors. Chromothripsis is a relatively novel form of genomic instability reported in a wide range of neoplasms [1, 2] and refers to shattering of a chromosome or part of a chromosome with subsequent segmental gene rearrangements in large numbers. It is currently thought to represent a single catastrophic breakage event leading to additional tumorigenesis. This is in contradistinction to the more well-delineated forms of genomic instability characterized by incremental changes. The mechanism by which chromothripsis occurs is not well understood; ionizing radiation, telomere dysfunction, abortive apoptosis, replication stress, and mitotic compaction of incompletely replicated chromosomes have been posited as potential triggers [2]. Generally, chromothripsis is linked to poorer prognosis [1]. With increased availability of advanced cytogenomic molecular assays, and growing recognition of the importance of molecular and genomic classification particularly of central nervous system neoplasms, an ever-increasing amount of molecular data becomes available. Here we report on a group of CNS neoplasms (primary and metastatic) in which cytogenomic analysis revealed chromothripsis. This cohort consists of 9 cases identified over a 7-month period. All cases were considered high-grade malignant neoplasms. Six of the cases (67%) represented primary CNS neoplasms consisting of glioblastoma (4), anaplastic pilocytic astrocytoma (1), and an atypical meningioma (1). The remaining cases (3) were metastases: melanoma, uterine sarcoma, and lung adenocarcinoma. The age range of patients affected was 27 to 80 years old with a median age of 57. Five of the nine patients (56%) were male, and 4 patients (44%) had passed away already at the time of this study, with a median survival of 4.5 months after surgery. Of note, all but one (89%) of the total patients had received radiation therapy prior to biopsy. From our institutional experience, chromothripsis is an indication of highgrade malignant neoplasms, both primary CNS tumors and metastases, with decreased survival.",Excluded
2556,"Acute phase response before treatment predicts radiation esophagitis in non-small cell lung cancer. BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Radiation esophagitis (RE) represents an inflammatory reaction to radiation therapy (RT). We hypothesized that aspects of the physiologic acute phase response (APR) predicts RE., MATERIAL AND METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed 285 patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) treated with definitive radiation. The primary analysis was the association of pretreatment lab values reflective of the APR with symptomatic (grade 2) RE. Univariate and multivariate odds ratios (ORs) were calculated to test associations of clinical and pretreatment lab values with RE. Optimal cutpoints and multivariable risk stratification groupings were determined via recursive partitioning analysis., RESULTS: Pretreatment platelet counts were higher and hemoglobin levels lower in patients who developed RE (P<0.05). Based on these two pre-treatment risk factors, an APR score was defined as 0 (no risk factors), 1 (either risk factor), or 2 (both risk factors). APR score was significantly associated with RE in both univariate (OR = 2.3 for each point, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.5-3.4, P = 0.001) and multivariate (OR = 2.1, 95% CI 1.3-3.4, P = 0.002) analyses., CONCLUSIONS: The APR score may represent a novel metric to predict RE. However, pending validation in an independent dataset, caution is advised when interpreting these results given their retrospective and thus exploratory nature. Copyright © 2014 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

2539,"Injectable bone graft for the repair of nonunion of midshaft clavicular fracture after internal fixation. BACKGROUND: Treatment of nonunion of clavicular fractures usually requires the insertion of bone material to facilitate bone healing. Injectable bone grafts have been successfully used in the treatment of limb fractures and lumbar fusion. However, there are few studies on its use in the treatment of nonunion. OBJECTIVE(S): To investigate the clinical effect of injection bone graft in the treatment of nonunion of clavicle fracture after internal fixation. METHOD(S): Totally 13 patients (9 males and 4 females aged 19-54 years old) with nonunion after internal fixation of clavicular fractures in the middle segment of the clavicle, who were treated in the No. 908 Hospital of Joint Logistic Support Force of Chinese PLA from January 2015 to December 2016, were selected. All of them were treated with ALLOMATRIX injection bone graft. Postoperative follow-up was conducted for 12 months. The fracture healing quality was evaluated by Lane-Sandhu X-ray score, and the shoulder joint function was evaluated by Constant score. This experiment was approved by the Ethics Committee of No. 908 Hospital of Joint Logistic Support Force of Chinese PLA. RESULTS AND CONCLUSION(S): (1) All the 13 patients received osseous healing, which lasted 8-16 weeks, and no complications such as infection, dislocation, or fixator loosening occurred. (2) The total Lane-Sandhu X-ray score of 13 patients at 3 months and the last follow-up was higher than that before the operation (P < 0. 05). (3) The total Constant score of shoulder joint function in 13 patients was higher than that before surgery at 3 months after surgery and at the last follow-up (P < 0. 05).

906,"Effective stepwise training and procedure standardization for young surgeons to perform laparoscopic left hepatectomy. Background: Laparoscopic hepatectomy remains one of the most difficult procedures for young surgeons to perform. We recently developed a new training method and standardization procedure for teaching young surgeons to perform laparoscopic left hepatectomy (Lap-LHx). The aim of this study was to assess the effectiveness of our method. Method(s): In 2004, we standardized a laparoscopic procedure for Lap-LHx, using a laparoscopy-assisted method as a stepping stone. The laparoscopic training method comprised the following three steps: (1) training in fundamental procedures using a dry box and checking by mentors; (2) detailed preoperative simulation using Vincent three-dimensional software for each patient; and (3) self-assessment including understanding of relevant anatomy and completion grade for each procedure using a check sheet and feedback by both mentors and a professor. Twenty-three Lap-LHx procedures performed during the study period were divided into two groups: those performed by young non-board-certified surgeons (n = 9) and those performed by senior board-certified surgeons (n = 14). Result(s): The blood loss and operative time were similar in the young surgeon (194 g and 336 min, respectively) and senior surgeon groups (208 g and 322 min, respectively). Conclusion(s): Our standardized Lap-LHx procedure and stepwise training to perform it enable young surgeons to perform Lap-LHx as confidently and safely as more experienced surgeons.Copyright © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media New York.",Excluded

Objectives: To compare single-energy (SECT) and dual-energy (DECT) abdominal CT examinations in matched patient cohorts regarding differences in radiation dose and image quality performed with second- and third-generation dual-source CT (DSCT). Method(s): We retrospectively analysed 200 patients (100 male, 100 female; mean age 61.2 +/- 13.5 years, mean body mass index 27.5 +/- 3.8 kg/m2) equally divided into four groups matched by gender and body mass index, who had undergone portal venous phase abdominal CT with second-generation (group A, 120-kV-SECT; group B, 80/140-kV-DECT) and third-generation DSCT (group C, 100-kV-SECT; group D, 90/150-kV-DECT). The radiation dose was normalised for 40-cm scan length. Dose-independent figure-of-merit (FOM) contrast-to-noise ratios (CNRs) were calculated for various organs and vessels. Subjective overall image quality and reader confidence were assessed. Result(s): The effective normalised radiation dose was significantly lower (P < 0.001) in groups C (6.2 +/- 2.0 mSv) and D (5.3 +/- 1.9 mSv, P = 0.103) compared to groups A (8.8 +/- 2.3 mSv) and B (9.7 +/- 2.4 mSv, P = 0.102). Dose-independent FOM-CNR peaked for liver, kidney, and portal vein measurements (all P <= 0.0285) in group D. Subjective image quality and reader confidence were consistently rated as excellent in all groups (all >=1.53 out of 5). Conclusion(s): With both DSCT generations, abdominal DECT can be routinely performed without radiation dose penalty compared to SECT, while third-generation DSCT shows improved dose efficiency. Key Points: * Dual-source CT (DSCT) allows for single- and dual-energy image acquisition. * Dual-energy acquisition does not increase the radiation dose in abdominal DSCT. * Third-generation DSCT shows improved dose efficiency compared to second-generation DSCT. * Dose-independent figure-of-merit image contrast was highest with third-generation dual-energy DSCT. * Third-generation DSCT shows improved dose efficiency for SECT and DECT.Copyright © 2016, European Society of Radiology.",Excluded

This study was designed to examine the feasibility of combining lymphoscintigraphy and intraoperative sentinel node identification in patients with head and neck melanoma by using a hybrid protein colloid that is both radioactive and fluorescent. Methods. Eleven patients scheduled for sentinel node biopsy in the head and neck region were studied. Approximately 5 h before surgery, the hybrid nanocolloid labeled with indocyanine green (ICG) and technetium-99m (99mTc) was injected intradermally in four deposits around the scar of the primary melanoma excision. Subsequent lymphoscintigraphy and single photon emission computed tomography with computed tomography (SPECT/CT) were performed to identify the sentinel nodes preoperatively. In the operating room, patent blue dye was injected in 7 of the 11 patients. Intraoperatively, sentinel nodes were acoustically localized with a gamma ray detection probe and visualized by using patent blue dye and/or fluorescencebased tracing with a dedicated near-infrared light camera. A portable gamma camera was used before and after sentinel node excision to confirm excision of all sentinel nodes. Results. A total of 27 sentinel nodes were preoperatively identified on the lymphoscintigraphy and SPECT/CT images. All sentinel nodes could be localized intraoperatively. In the seven patients in whom blue dye was used, 43% of the sentinel nodes stained blue, whereas all were fluorescent. The portable gamma camera identified additional sentinel nodes in two patients. Ex vivo, all radioactive lymph nodes were fluorescent and vice versa, indicating the stability of the hybrid tracer. Conclusions. ICG-99mTc- nanocolloid allows for preoperative sentinel node visualization and concomitant intraoperative radio- and fluorescence guidance to the same sentinel nodes in head and neck melanoma patients. © 2012 Society of Surgical Oncology.",Excluded
2154,"A phase i study on the combination of neoadjuvant radiotherapy plus pazopanib in patients with locally advanced soft tissue sarcoma of the extremities. Accumulating evidence suggests significant synergism combining radiotherapy (RT) with angiogenesis targeted therapies. This multicenter prospective phase I clinical trial established the safety profile and recommended dose for further studies of pazopanib concurrent with preoperative RT in patients with extremity soft tissue sarcomas (ESTS) in curative setting.Methods. Patients with deep seated intermediate and high grade sarcomas, >= 5 cm, received once daily pazopanib (dose-escalation cohorts 400 mg, 600 mg and 800 mg) for 6 weeks and 50 Gy preoperative RT starting Day 8. Surgery was performed 5-7 weeks later. Toxicity was scored according to CTC criteria 4.0. Dose limiting toxicities (DLT) were divided into two separate sets; DLT-I being toxicities occurring during the 6-week chemoradiotherapy period within the radiation portals until day of surgery (designated as DLT-I) and those occurring perioperatively until Day 21 after surgery (DLT-II).Results. A total of 12 patients were enrolled, 11 were evaluable (3 females and 8 males, median age 58 years, range 24-78 years, median tumor size 9 cm, range 5-15 cm). Ten underwent surgery. No increased toxicity inside the radiation fields was seen, but two of 10 patients (one each in the 400 mg and 600 mg cohorts) showed delayed wound healing after surgery. None of the patients showed significant volume reductions after RT. Evaluation of the resection specimen showed pathological (near) complete responses (>= 95% necrosis rate) in four of 10 cases. Unexpectedly, grade 3 + hepatotoxicity led to premature pazopanib interruption in three of 11 (27%) of cases.Conclusion. Apart from hepatotoxicity, neoadjuvant pazopanib 800 mg daily in combination with 50 Gy seems tolerable; the regimen appears to demonstrate promising activity in ESTS and is the recommended dose for further studies.Copyright © 2015 Informa Healthcare.",Excluded

Five-year-experiences have shown that a considerably intensified tolerance of the skin and an absorption equability of tissues and bones and muscles are obtained with the hard ray roentgen irradiator, RT 305, for half-value depths from 20 mm to 70 mm H-2O and half-value thickness to about 7 mm Cu. By means of a rod anode tube of 300 kV with a super-normal filtration to 3.5 mm Pb, a hard and nearly monochromatic radiation, which already possesses the above mentioned advantages of the ultra-hard ray therapy with an effective energy about 0.2 MeV, appears. The application of this hard ray therapy is given preferably for disease foci in the environment of bone tissues, i.e. in the head and throat, the vertebral column, the osseous pelvic ring and the extremities and as the conventional roentgen therapy ist not able to give it. The hard ray therapy seems to be particularly adapted for the postoperative irradiation of the cancer of the breast with the ribs lying in the region of the irradiation fields, with the sternum and the bones of the shoulder girdle.

PURPOSE: To evaluate functional results and corneal changes after femtosecond laser correction of presbyopia (INTRACOR, Technolas Perfect Vision GmbH) in emmetropes using a modified treatment pattern over a 12-month period., METHODS: Twenty eyes from 20 emmetropic patients were treated with a modified intrastromal INTRACOR pattern consisting of 5 central rings and 8 radial cuts in a prospective, nonrandomized, uncontrolled, open, single-center, clinical study. Refraction, visual acuity, endothelial cell density, corneal pachymetry, total corneal power, and stray light were evaluated preoperatively and 1 (except endothelial cell density and stray light), 3, 6, and 12 months postoperatively. Patients filled out a subjective questionnaire at 12 months postoperatively., RESULTS: Comparison of preoperative versus 12-month postoperative median values revealed a significant improvement in uncorrected near visual acuity (UNVA) from 0.60 (20/80) to 0.10 logMAR (20/25) (P<.0001) and a significant decrease in corrected distance visual acuity (CDVA) from -0.10 (20/16) to 0.00 logMAR (20/20), which equals a median loss of one line (P=.0005). Fifteen percent of patients lost two lines of CDVA in the treated eye. Subjective spherical equivalent refraction remained unchanged at 0.00 diopters (D) (P=.194).

3279,"[Intraoperative radiotherapy in abdominal-pelvic cancer surgery]. Intraoperative radiotherapy consists in the irradiation of the affected area, exposed using anesthesiological and laparotomic procedures, following the removal of a neoplasia using palliative or macroscopically radical surgical. This increases local tumour control and augments the selectivity of treatment between healthy and neoplastic tissues, thus obtaining a marked improvement in survival or palliation. The authors analyse the data reported in international literature regarding the possible use of intraoperative radiotherapy in patients undergoing abdomino-pelvic oncological surgery. The aim of the study was to evaluate this method for use in selected and combined treatment in which surgery represents an obligatory step. Studies were carried out in a few highly specialised centres given that special technical, logistic and professional skills were required. The populations studied were often very small with a marked prevalence of feasibility studies compared to random studies. In spite of this intraoperative radiotherapy is undoubtedly indicated in locally advanced gastric, rectal and vesical neoplasia, it represents a valid palliative solution in pancreatic neoplasia and in pelvic recidivation, and an effective alternative solution to mutilating surgery in the initial stages of vesical cancer. Positive results are obtained in prostate and uterine cancer, but they are reported by non-conclusive studies. Toxicity is acceptable and non-limiting within a given range of doses and irradiated volume. The ""repercussion"" in terms of knowledge, experience, scientific integration between oncological surgeons and radiotherapists is basic, with a marked improved in the management of cancer treatment.",Excluded
1821,"Flexible Modeling of the Association between Cumulative Exposure to Low-Dose Ionizing Radiation from Cardiac Procedures and Risk of Cancer in Adults with Congenital Heart Disease. Adults with congenital heart disease are increasingly being exposed to low-dose ionizing radiation (LDIR) from cardiac procedures. In a recent study, Cohen et al. (Circulation. 2018;137(13):1334-1345) reported an association between increased LDIR exposure and cancer incidence but did not explore temporal relationships. Yet, the impact of past exposures probably accumulates over years, and its strength may depend on the amount of time elapsed since exposure. Furthermore, LDIR procedures performed shortly before a cancer diagnosis may have been ordered because of early symptoms of cancer, raising concerns about reversal causality bias. To address these challenges, we combined flexible modeling of cumulative exposures with competing-risks methodology to estimate separate associations of time-varying LDIR exposure with cancer incidence and all-cause mortality. Among 24,833 patients from the Quebec Congenital Heart Disease Database, 602 had incident cancer and 500 died during a follow-up period of up to 15 years (1995-2010). Initial results suggested a strong association of cancer incidence with very recent LDIR exposures, likely reflecting reverse causality bias. When exposure was lagged by 2 years, an increased cumulative LDIR dose from the previous 2-6 years was associated with increased cancer incidence, with a stronger association for women. These results illustrate the importance of accurate modeling of temporal relationships between time-varying exposures and health outcomes.Copyright © 2019 The Author(s).

Background and objective: Radiation pneumonitis (RP) could be a lethal complication of lung cancer treatment. No reliable predictors of RP severity have been recognized. This prospective pilot study was performed to identify early predictors of high grade lung toxicity and to evaluate clinical, biological or dosimetric features associated with different grades of toxicity. Method(s): Sixteen patients with non-small cell lung cancer with indication of concurrent chemoradiotherapy using 60 Gy/2 Gy/fraction starting at cycle one of platinum based chemotherapy were included. Bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL), pulmonary function testing (PFT), and 18F-2-fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose positron-emission tomography was performed before radiotherapy (RT), after three weeks of treatment, and two months post-RT. For analysis, patients were grouped by grade (low [G1-G2] vs. high [G3-G5]). The two groups were compared to identify predictors of RP. Protein expression BAL and lung tissue metabolism was evaluated in two patients (RP-G1 vs. RP-G3). Categorical variables such as comorbidities, stages and locations were summarized as percentages. Radiation doses, pulmonary function values and time to RP were summarized by medians with ranges or as means with standard deviation. Longitudinal analysis PFT was performed by a T-test. Result(s): All 16 patients developed RP, as follows: G1 (5 pts; 31.3%); G2 (5 pts; 31.3%); G3 (5 pts; 31.3%); and G5 (1 pts; 6.1%). Patients with high grade RP presented significant decrease (p = 0.02) in diffusing lung capacity for carbon monoxide (DLCO) after three weeks of RT. No correlation between dosimetric values and RP grades was observed. BAL analysis of the selected patients showed that CXCL-1, CD154, IL-1ra, IL-23, MIF, PAI-1 and IFN-gamma were overexpressed in the lungs of the RP-G3 patient, even before treatment. The pre-RT SUVmax value in the RP-G3 patient was non-significantly higher than in the patient with RP-G1. Conclusion(s): RT induces some degree of RP. Our data suggest that decrease in DLCO% is the most sensitive parameter for the early detection of RP. Moreover, we detect biological differences between the two grades of pneumonitis, highlighting the potential value of some cytokines as a prognostic marker for developing high grade lung toxicity. Further multicenter studies with larger sample size are essential to validate these findings.Copyright © 2020, The Author(s).",Excluded

Although radiotherapy is a standard part of the treatment armamentarium for KS patients, a high incidence of radiotoxicity has been reported in epidemic AIDS-related cases. In order to determine whether this radiotoxicity is observed only in patients with the epidemic form of the disease, we have conducted a retrospective chart review of 30 patients with classical KS treated with radiation for whom follow-up information was available. Seven out of 30 (23%) were found to have unexpectedly high levels of radiotoxicity after tumor doses of 22-42 Gy. This toxicity consisted either of significantly increased edema or chronic skin breakdown and severe radiodermatitis, in some cases requiring multiple surgical corrective procedures. We suggest that the abnormal lymphaticovenous development and chronic lymphokine stimulation associated with KS of both epidemic and classical forms may be responsible in part for the observed radiotoxicity.",Excluded
1148,"Combining cisplatin and mitomycin with radiotherapy in anal carcinoma. PURPOSE: The European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) phase II study No. 22953 demonstrated the feasibility of reducing the overall treatment time of chemoradiation, delivering mitomycin C twice rather than once and fluorouracil during the whole treatment. We tested the feasibility of chemoradiation in anal carcinoma with mitomycin and cisplatin in a phase II study. METHOD(S): Twenty-one patients with locally advanced anal carcinoma (15 women, 6 men) were treated. The first sequence of radiotherapy consisted of 36 Gy over four weeks. After a gap interval of 16 days, a second sequence of radiotherapy was given, delivering 23.4 Gy over 2.5 weeks. Mitomycin C was delivered at 10 mg/m2 day 1 of each sequence and cisplatin was delivered at 25 mg/m2/week of each sequence. RESULT(S): The compliance rates for the first sequence with radiation, mitomycinm, and cispaltin (dose and timing) were 100 percent. The median duration gap was 16 days (14-30 days). The compliance rates for the second sequence with radiation, mitomycin, and cisplatin (dose and timing) were 100, 76.2, and 85.7 percent, respectively. Grade>=2 acute toxicities of 62, 29, 25, and 5 percent were observed for skin, diarrhea, hematologic, and renal toxicities, respectively. Nineteen patients were in complete response (90.5 percent). CONCLUSION(S): Combining radiation with mitomycin and cisplatin in patients with locally advanced anal cancer is feasible. The results are promising. The EORTC is currently comparing this combination with mitomycin and 5-fluorouracil in a large phase II-III trial. © 2006 The American Society of Colon and Rectal Surgeons.",Excluded
1268,"Computed tomography-guided percutaneous infiltrations for piriformis syndrome: A single-center retrospective study. Piriformis syndrome (PS), first described by Yeoman in 1928, is a general term referring to low back pain, sciatica, and instability. PS has a 6% incidence rate worldwide. In this study, we aim to retrospectively evaluate the effectiveness of computed tomography (CT)-guided percutaneous infiltration in a series of consecutive PS patients who have symptoms that are refractory to conservative therapies. An institutional database search identified 20 such consecutive patients who underwent infiltration with a mixture of long-acting corticosteroid and local anesthetic. Preoperational evaluation included physical examination and magnetic resonance imaging. The correct position of the 22-gauge spinal needle was verified with CT scan after contrast medium injection. Pain measured before the procedure and at 1 wk and 1, 6, and 12 mo after the procedure was compared by means of a numeric visual scale (NVS) questionnaire. The mean pain score before CT-guided percutaneous infiltration was 8.95 +/- 1.432 NVS units. This score was reduced to a mean value of 0.85 +/- 0.933 units at 1 wk, 0.90 +/- 0.852 at 1 mo, 1.10 +/- 1.165 at 6 mo, and 1.20 +/- 1.399 at 12 mo follow-up (p < 0.001). Two patients of 20 (10%) underwent a second infiltration that was performed at 7 and 10 d after the first, respectively. No complications were observed. CT-guided infiltration seems to be a feasible, efficacious, and safe approach for pain reduction and mobility improvement in patients with symptomatic PS.Copyright © 2020 by Begell House, Inc. www.begellhouse.com.",Excluded

We conducted a survey of doctors working in the cardiac catheterisation laboratories in Africa on their knowledge, attitude and practice with respect to radiation protection. Of seventy-two respondents contacted, 61 (84.7%) completed the questionnaire. Twenty-eight, (45.9%) were younger than 45 years. Thirty-seven, (60.6%) had less than 10 years of experience in the laboratory. Only 28 (45.9%) had undertaken radiation protection training. Fifty-eight, (95.1%) consistently used lead aprons. Forty-seven, (77%) reported consistently using thyroid shields. Ten (16.4%) consistently used radiation protection eyeglasses, whilst 36 (59%) never used them. Thermoluminescent Dosimeter badges were consistently used in 23 (37.7%). Forty-two, (68.9%) reported having ceiling mounted lead/acrylic shields. Level of radiation exposure in the most recent one year was <=2 mSv in 14, between 2 and 20 mSv in 8 and between 20 and 30 mSv in 2, whilst 33 did not know their dose readings. The use of basic radiation protection tools as well as the knowledge and measurement of radiation exposure among interventional cardiologists working in Africa is low. The unavailability of some of the protective tools and a knowledge gap in terms of radiation protection and monitoring of self-exposure were some of the reasons for suboptimal self-protection against ionising radiation among our respondents. We suggest that initiatives be taken by all stakeholders to train this group of medical professionals in basic radiation protection to avoid unnecessary exposure to themselves, co-workers and patients.",Excluded
1363,"Patterns of Care Study of radiation therapy for esophageal cancer in Japan: Influence of age on parameters of treatment. Background. In Japan, the elderly population is growing rapidly, and therefore, so is the number of cancer patients who are not good candidates for aggressive surgery or chemotherapy. Radiation therapy offers excellent potential for the treatment of such patients, with minimal invasion and functional preservation. A Patterns of Care Study (PCS) examined the parameters of treatments used for patients with esophageal cancer to determine nationwide variations by age. Methods. From July 1996 through February 1997, external nationwide PCS audits were performed for 29 institutions. Medical charts were reviewed for 455 patients with thoracic esophageal cancer treated between 1992 and 1994. The parameters of treatments used for these patients were compared between those aged >=75 years (elderly; n = 113) and those aged <75 years (younger; n = 342). Results. Surgery was used in 49% of the younger group and in 17% of the elderly group (P < 0.0001) while chemotherapy was used in 48% of the younger and 24% of the older group (P < 0.0001). The ratio of non-surgery group with radiation therapy increased significantly from 49% to 82% (P < 0.0001). Approximately 70% of the non- surgery patients received an external radiation dose of more than 60 Gy, even in the elderly (P = 0.3001). Preliminary results showed no significant difference in survival between the two age groups (P = 0.5559). Conclusions. The use of radiation therapy in elderly people with esophageal cancer has increased markedly. The PCS provided important information about variations in radiotherapy parameters in patients with esophageal cancer in relation to age. Such information should be useful for future prospective studies of the elderly.",Excluded
3154,"Timed barium swallow and its usefullness in achalasia and non-achalasia dysphagia. Introduction: Timed barium swallow (TBS) was initially described by researchers at the Cleveland Clinic (AJR 1997). This test was designed to assess esophageal emptying in patients (pts) with achalasia before and after therapy, i.e. pneumatic dilation/ surgical myotomy. Over time it became part of standard workup at our Swallowing Center in all dysphagia cases. It is simple to perform, radiation exposure is minimal and it gives details on both esophageal anatomy and emptying of liquids and tablet. Our aim was to determine the usefulness of TBS in pts with non-achalasia dysphagia in comparison to achalasia pts. Method(s): Retrospective review of medical records of 150 consecutive pts who underwent TBS evaluation between 04/2014 and 09/2015 at our Institution. Pts were separated into achalasia and non-achalasia groups. Diagnosis of achalasia established by high resolution manometry. Standard protocol was used for all TBS. After drinking 6-8 oz of low density barium in the standing position, lateral film obtained followed by two-on-one spot films at 1 and 5 min. to assess liquid emptying. The esophagus was rinsed with water followed by ingestion of a 13 mm tablet. Tablet passage evaluated after 5 minutes with an abnormal test being tablet retention. TBS for liquid barium considered normal if < 1 cm of barium retention after 1 min in distal esophagus. One radiologist (JF) interpreted all TBS. Result(s): 72 pts (49% females) with achalasia/ mean age 57 years (type 1: 12 pts (17%), type 2: 35 pts (49%), type 3: 7 pts (10%), achalasia type not specified 18 pts (24%)) and 78 pts (62% females) without achalasia/ mean age of 62.25 years. Table 1 defines final diagnoses in non-achalasia pts. Achalasia pts more frequently had abnormal TBS than non-achalasia pts (96% vs. 65%, p < 0.0001). Table 2: characteristics of TBS in both groups. Non-esophageal findings identified on TBS in 10% of achalasia and in 20% of non-achalasia pts including musculoskeletal lesions (20 pts), lung nodule (5 pts), hilar prominence or calcifications (4 pts) and cardiomegaly or aortic calcifications (4 pts). Lung cancer found in 1 non-achalasia patient. Conclusion(s): 1. TBS is a simple and useful test in separation of achalasia and non-achalasia dysphagia. 2. Pts with achalasia are more likely to have abnormal TBS for barium liquid and tablet than non -achalasia dysphagia pts. 3. Pts with non-achalasia dysphagia are more likely to have abnormal TBS either for liquid barium or tablet only than achalasia pts.",Excluded
3531,"Comparison of muscle area and strength between OA knees with and without structural progression - Data from the OA initiative. Purpose: Quadriceps strength was observed to protect against the onset of symptomatic knee OA, but whether it protects against structural progression of knee OA once it is established radiographically, is currently unclear. The objectives of this study were to determine whether baseline or two-year changes in anatomical muscle cross sectional areas (ACSAs) of the quadriceps (heads), hamstrings, and adductors, and/or muscle strength of the extensor and flexors differ between OA knees with structural progression (cartilage loss in MRI and joint space width loss in X-rays) compared with OA knees without structural progression. Method(s): A subcohort of the OA Initiative was used, for which baseline and one-year follow up (FU) quantitative MRI analysis on cartilage thickness was available in one knee (n=719). Of these, n=561 also had quantitative measurement of radiographic joint space width (JSW) at baseline and at one year follow-up, and central X-ray readings from fixed flexion radiographs (public-use data sets 0.E.1/3.E.1). From these, we identified those with structural progression in the medial femorotibial compartment according to both MRI and radiographic JSW, using the smallest detectable change method (n=46). Of those, we included 41 with KLG2 or 3, of which n=23 had axial T1-weighted SE images of the thigh at baseline and 2 year follow-up as well as muscle strength measurement (Isometric chair, Metitur Oy, Jyvaskyla, Finland). For 20 of these we were able to match controls with no progression in either MRI or JSW, with the same sex and KLG, with a body height within 3cm and a BMI within 5kg/m2, and with a WOMAC pain score within 5 (of 20) units. Public use MRI data (T1-weighted spin echo sequence/0.E.1/3.E.1) and custom software were used to determine the ACSAs and signal intensities of the quadriceps, hamstrings, and adductors in an axial image located at 33% of the femoral length (distal to proximal; location estimated based on body height). The four quadriceps heads were analyzed in an axial image slice located at 30% femoral length. Baseline and follow-up data were analyzed independently. A paired t-test was used to compare measurements in progressors vs. nonprogressors. Result(s): Cases with MRI and X-ray progression (age 63.1+/-7.8 y) and controls without progression (age 65.8+/-10.0 y) consisted of 12 women and 8 men, respectively. Progressors did not show significantly smaller baseline total quadriceps, specific quadriceps heads, flexor, or adductor ACSAs, or significantly smaller extensor and flexor strength than matched controls (Table 1). (Table presented) Further, no differences in the mean or SD signal intensity in any of the muscle regions were noted at baseline (data not shown). Changes in ACSAs over 2 years also did not significantly differ between progressor and non-progressor knees (Table 1). When stratifying comparisons for cases with little baseline pain (WOMAC score of 0-1; n=7) vs. those with a score of 5-8 (n=8), the findings were similar (data not shown). Conclusion(s): Progressor (case) and non-progressor (control) knees in this study were carefully selected from a large subsample, based on two independent measures of structural OA progression (MRI cartilage loss and JSW reduction in X-rays). Further, cases and controls were carefully matched for measures known to be associated with progression or with muscle area. The results of this exploratory study do not provide support that, once radiographic knee OA is established, baseline or longitudinal changes in thigh muscle ACSAs or strength predict (or are associated) with structural progression.",Excluded
1620,"Impact of the radiosurgery prescription dose on the local control of small (2 cm or smaller) brain metastases. OBJECTIVE The impact of the stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) prescription dose (PD) on local progression and radiation necrosis for small (<= 2 cm) brain metastases was evaluated. METHODS An institutional review board-approved retrospective review was performed on 896 patients with brain metastases <= 2 cm (3034 tumors) who were treated with 1229 SRS procedures between 2000 and 2012. Local progression and/or radiation necrosis were the primary end points. Each tumor was followed from the date of radiosurgery until one of the end points was reached or the last MRI follow-up. Various criteria were used to differentiate tumor progression and radiation necrosis, including the evaluation of serial MRIs, cerebral blood volume on perfusion MR, FDG-PET scans, and, in some cases, surgical pathology. The median radiographic follow-up per lesion was 6.2 months. RESULTS The median patient age was 56 years, and 56% of the patients were female. The most common primary pathology was non-small cell lung cancer (44%), followed by breast cancer (19%), renal cell carcinoma (14%), melanoma (11%), and small cell lung cancer (5%). The median tumor volume and median largest diameter were 0.16 cm3 and 0.8 cm, respectively. In total, 1018 lesions (34%) were larger than 1 cm in maximum diameter. The PD for 2410 tumors (80%) was 24 Gy, for 408 tumors (13%) it was 19 to 23 Gy, and for 216 tumors (7%) it was 15 to 18 Gy. In total, 87 patients (10%) had local progression of 104 tumors (3%), and 148 patients (17%) had at least radiographic evidence of radiation necrosis involving 199 tumors (7%; 4% were symptomatic). Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed for local progression and radiation necrosis. For local progression, tumors less than 1 cm (subhazard ratio [SHR] 2.32; p < 0.001), PD of 24 Gy (SHR 1.84; p = 0.01), and additional whole-brain radiation therapy (SHR 2.53; p = 0.001) were independently associated with better outcome. For the development of radiographic radiation necrosis, independent prognostic factors included size greater than 1 cm (SHR 2.13; p < 0.001), location in the corpus callosum (SHR 5.72; p < 0.001), and uncommon pathologies (SHR 1.65; p = 0.05). Size (SHR 4.78; p < 0.001) and location (SHR 7.62; p < 0.001)-but not uncommon pathologies-were independent prognostic factors for the subgroup with symptomatic radiation necrosis. CONCLUSIONS A PD of 24 Gy results in significantly better local control of metastases measuring < 2 cm than lower doses. In addition, tumor size is an independent prognostic factor for both local progression and radiation necrosis. Some tumor pathologies and locations may also contribute to an increased risk of radiation necrosis.",Excluded

2875,"The impact of lymphocyte isolation on induced DNA damage in human blood samples measured by the comet assay. The comet assay is frequently used in human biomonitoring for the detection of exposure to genotoxic agents. Peripheral blood samples are most frequently used and tested either as whole blood or after isolation of lymphocytes (i.e. peripheral blood mononuclear cells, PBMC). To investigate a potential impact of lymphocyte isolation on induced DNA damage in human blood samples, we exposed blood ex vivo to mutagens with different modes of genotoxic action. The comet assay was performed either directly with whole blood at the end of the exposure period or with lymphocytes isolated directly after exposure. In addition to the recommended standard protocol for lymphocyte isolation, a shortened protocol was established to optimise the isolation procedure. The results indicate that the effects of induced DNA strand breaks and alkali-labile sites induced by ionising radiation and alkylants, respectively, are significantly reduced in isolated lymphocytes. In contrast, oxidative DNA base damage (induced by potassium bromate) and stable bulky adducts (induced by benzo[a]pyrene-7,8-dihydrodiol-9,10-epoxide; BPDE) seem to be less affected. Our findings suggest that in vivo-induced DNA damage might also be reduced in isolated lymphocytes in comparison with the whole blood depending of the types of DNA damage induced. Because only small genotoxic effects can generally be expected in human biomonitoring studies with the comet assay after occupational and environmental exposure to genotoxic agents, any loss might be relevant and should be avoided. The possibility of such effects and their potential impact on variability of comet assay results in human biomonitoring should be considered when performing or evaluating such kind of studies.

970,"The impact of the effective dose to immune cells on lymphopenia and survival of esophageal cancer after chemoradiotherapy. Purpose: To test the hypothesis that effective dose to circulating immune cells (EDIC) impacts the severity of radiation-induced lymphopenia and clinical outcomes of esophageal cancer patients treated with concurrent chemoradiotherapy (CCRT). Material(s) and Method(s): 488 esophageal cancer patients treated with CCRT with and without surgery were analyzed. The EDIC model considers the exposure of circulating immune cells as the proportion of blood flow to lung, heart, liver, and the volume of the exposed area of the body, with the basis of mean lung dose (MLD), mean heart dose (MHD), mean liver dose (MlD), and integral dose (ITD) of the body region scanned, calculated as: EDIC=0.12*MLD+0.08*MHD+0.15*0.85*MlD*[Formula presented]1/2+0.45+0.35*0.85*[Formula presented]1/2*[Formula presented] Where n is the fraction number. Correlations of EDIC with overall survival (OS), progression free survival (PFS), distant metastasis free survival (DMFS), and locoregional control (LRC) rates were analyzed using both univariable and multivariable Cox models. Lymphopenia during CCRT was graded according to Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events version 4.0. Result(s): Grade 4 lymphopenia resulted in inferior clinical outcomes, including OS, PFS, and DMFS. The median EDIC was 3.6 Gy (range, 0.8-6.0 Gy). Higher EDIC was strongly associated with severe lymphopenia, particularly when EDIC was above 4 Gy. Patients with EDIC > 4.0 Gy had more G4 lymphopenia than those with EDIC <= 4.0 Gy (67.3% vs. 40.8%; P < 0.001). On multivariate analysis, increasing EDIC was independently and inversely associated with worse OS, PFS, and DMFS. Conclusion(s): EDIC can be recommended as a useful tool to predict lymphopenia and inferior clinical outcomes, and it should be minimized below 4 Gy.Copyright © 2020 Elsevier B.V.",Excluded
778,"Residual tumor after neoadjuvant chemoradiation outside the radiation therapy target volume: A new prognostic factor for survival in esophageal cancer. Purpose/Objective(s) The aim of this study was to analyze the accuracy of gross tumor volume (GTV) delineation and clinical target volume (CTV) margins for neoadjuvant chemoradiation therapy (neo-CRT) in esophageal carcinoma at pathologic examination and to determine the impact on survival. Methods and Materials The study population consisted of 63 esophageal cancer patients treated with neo-CRT. GTV and CTV borders were demarcated in situ during surgery on the esophagus, using anatomical reference points to provide accurate information regarding tumor location at pathologic evaluation. To identify prognostic factors for disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS), a Cox regression analysis was performed. Results After resection, macroscopic residual tumor was found outside the GTV in 7 patients (11%). Microscopic residual tumor was located outside the CTV in 9 patients (14%). The median follow-up was 15.6 months. With multivariate analysis, only microscopic tumor outside the CTV (hazard ratio [HR], 4.96; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.03-15.36), and perineural growth (HR, 5.77; 95% CI, 1.27-26.13) were identified as independent prognostic factors for OS. The 1-year OS was 20% for patients with tumor outside the CTV and 86% for those without (P<.01). For DFS, microscopic tumor outside the CTV (HR, 5.92; 95% CI, 1.89-18.54) and ypN+ (HR, 3.36; 95% CI, 1.33-8.48) were identified as independent adverse prognostic factors. The 1-year DFS was 23% versus 77% for patients with or without tumor outside the CTV (P<.01). Conclusions Microscopic tumor outside the CTV is associated with markedly worse OS after neo-CRT. This may either stress the importance of accurate tumor delineation or reflect aggressive tumor behavior requiring new adjuvant treatment modalities. © 2014 Elsevier Inc.

PURPOSE: To define the value of low-dose multislice CT in a clinical setting for early detection of pneumonia in neutropenic patients with fever of unknown origin., MATERIALS AND METHODS: Thirty-five neutropenic patients suffering from fever of unknown origin with normal chest X-ray underwent unenhanced low-dose CT of the chest (120 kV, 10 eff. mAs, collimation 4 x 1 mm) using a multislice CT scanner. Axial und frontal slices with a thickness of 5 mm were calculated. If no pneumonia was found, standard antibiotics were given and a repeated examination was performed if fever continued. In case of pneumonia, antimycotic therapy was added and a follow-up CT was performed within one week. Regression or progression of pneumonia at follow-up served as evidence of pneumonia; lowering of fever within 48 h or inconspicuous follow-up CT was regarded as absence of pneumonia., RESULTS: Ten of 35 patients had pneumonic infiltration, which decreased or increased on follow-up CT in 3 and 6 patients, respectively. One patient revealed leucemic infiltration by bronchoalveolar lavage. Twenty-five of 35 patients had no evidence of pneumonia. Twenty of these patients were free of fever within 48 h under antibiotics; one patient died due to his basic illness. Out of 4 patients with persisting fever, 3 patients had no pneumonia on repeated examination; one patient showed disseminated micronodular infiltration. Frontal reconstructions helped to differentiate infiltration from atelectasis in 4 patients.

PURPOSE: Treatment of locally advanced rectal cancer (T3-T4 or N+) is based on short-course radiotherapy (RT) or chemoradiotherapy (CRT) followed by surgery. It is estimated that 30-40 % of rectal cancer occurs in patients aged 75 years or more. Data on adherence to neoadjuvant CRT and its safety remain poor owing to the under-representation of older patients in randomized clinical trials and the discordance in the results from retrospective studies. The aim of this study was to assess adherence with preoperative CRT and tolerability in older patients with a stage II/III unresectable rectal cancer., METHODS: Patients aged 75 years or more with stage II/III rectal cancer treated with preoperative CRT at the University Hospital of Besancon from 1993 to 2011 were included. Feasibility, toxicities, overall survival, and local recurrence rates were studied., RESULTS: Fifty-six patients with a Charlson score from 2 to 6 were included. The mean age was 78 years. The compliance rates for RT and chemotherapy were 91 and 41.1 %, respectively. Two patients stopped CRT; one for hemostatic surgery, and one for severe sepsis. For CRT, the rate of grade >=3 toxicity was 14.29 %, mainly the digestive type. Fifty-two patients underwent tumor resection, including 76.79 % total mesorectal excision resection with 84.6 % complete resection, and a rate of postoperative complications of 39.6 %. At 2 years, the overall survival and local recurrences rates were 87.3 and 7.8 %, respectively., CONCLUSION: In older patients, selected preoperative CRT, with an adapted chemotherapy dose, is well tolerated. The main toxicity was gastrointestinal. Adherence to RT is comparable to that of younger patients.",Excluded
2368,"Comparative efficacy of repetitive nerve stimulation, exercise, and cold in differentiating myotonic disorders. The decremental response of the compound muscle action potential (CMAP) to provocative tests is not characterized in genetically verified myotonic disorders. We therefore studied the relationship between decremental responses and mutation type in 10 patients with recessive myotonia congenita (rMC), two with paramyotonia congenita (PMC), nine with myotonic dystrophy type 1 (DM1), four with DM2, and 14 healthy people. CMAPs were measured at rest, just after a short exercise test (SET), and during short, 5- and 10-HZ, repetitive nerve stimulation (RNS) trains at 32 degrees C and at 20 degrees C. The degree of decrement was not related to the severity of clinical myotonia. Controls and PMC patients had similar responses when warm, but with cooling PMC patients had a persistent decrement of CMAPs. In the rMC patients the decremental responses were related to the type of mutation of the CLCN1 gene, as a decrement was encountered in the T268M, R894X, IVS17+1 G>T, K248X, and 2149 del G, but not with the IVS1+3 A>T, F167L, or dominant A313T mutations. In DM1 patients there was no relationship between decrement and CTG repeats. The degree of partial inexcitability in myotonic muscle membrane therefore depends on the mutation type rather than degree of clinical myotonia. RNS at 10 HZ is more sensitive than SET for demonstrating abnormalities in rMC patients when warm; differences are less marked when cold, which is useful to diagnose PMC. Provocative tests are therefore useful in myotonias to demonstrate muscle inexcitability, which depends on the chloride or sodium channelopathy.",Excluded
2358,"Endonasal phototherapy significantly alleviates symptoms of allergic rhinitis, but has a limited impact on the nasal mucosal immune cells. The literature documents the fact that UV irradiation of cutaneous Langerhans cells (LC) in vivo prevents the development of contact allergy and produces long-lasting immunosuppression. However, not much is known about the effect of UV irradiation on the LC of the nasal mucosa and their connection with clinical scores. Local antigen presentation may be necessary for both primary and recall T cell responses to birch pollen in patients with hay fever. Endonasal phototherapy combination of UVB (5%), UVA (25%) and visible light (70%) utilises the immunosuppressive effects of UV irradiation.

The clinical effectiveness of this form of treatment is discussed. Nasal biopsies were obtained from ten birch pollen-sensitive patients with seasonal rhinitis before and after endonasal phototherapy. All patients showed a significant clinical benefit post-treatment as assessed by standardised instruments, including total nasal symptom score, nasal congestion score, nasal itching score, sneezing score, nasal secretion score and impairment-to-health score. However, we found no significant morphological changes, to, or quantitative differences in, the CD1a+, CD4, CD8 or CD31 cells before and 14 days after treatment.

PURPOSE: To characterize the relationship between radiation pneumonitis (RP) clinical symptoms and pulmonary metabolic activity on post-treatment [(18)F]-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET)., PATIENTS AND METHODS: We retrospectively studied 101 esophageal cancer patients who underwent restaging FDG-PET/computed tomography imaging 3-12 weeks after completing thoracic radiotherapy. The National Institutes of Health Common Toxicity Criteria, version 3, was used to score the RP clinical symptoms. Linear regression was applied to the FDG-PET/computed tomography images to determine the normalized FDG uptake vs. radiation dose. The pulmonary metabolic radiation response (PMRR) was quantified as this slope. Modeling was performed to determine the interaction of PMRR, mean lung dose (MLD), and the percentage of lung receiving >20 Gy with RP outcomes., RESULTS: Of the 101 patients, 25 had Grade 0, 10 had Grade 1, 60 had Grade 2, 5 had Grade 3, and 1 had Grade 5 RP symptoms. Logistic regression analysis demonstrated that increased values of both MLD and PMRR were associated with a greater probability of RP clinical symptoms (p = 0.032 and p = 0.033, respectively). Spearman's rank correlation found no association between the PMRR and the dosimetric parameters (planning target volume, MLD, percentage of lung receiving >5-30 Gy). Twofold cross-validation demonstrated that the combination of MLD and PMRR was superior to either alone for assessing the development of clinical RP symptoms. The combined MLD (or percentage of lung receiving >20 Gy) and PMRR had a greater sensitivity and accuracy (53.3% and 62.5%, respectively) than either alone., CONCLUSION: The results of this study have demonstrated a significant correlation between RP clinical symptoms and the PMRR measured by FDG-PET/computed tomography after thoracic radiotherapy.",Excluded
2696,"Radioimmunoguided-intraoperative radiation therapy in colorectal carcinoma: A new technique to precisely define the clinical target volume. Purpose: The clinical target volume (CTV) to be irradiated by intraoperative radiation therapy (IORT) after resection is generally based on the surgeon's estimation of close margins. We have developed a new technique, radioimmunoguided-intraoperative radiation therapy (RIG-IORT), that uses an intraoperative hand-held gamma-detecting probe to define areas of residual microscopic disease containing radiolabeled monoclonal antibodies to tumor associated antigen, to more precisely delineate the CTV for IORT. Methods and Materials: Patients were injected i.v. with 2 mCi 125I-radiolabeled CC49 antibody approximately 3 weeks before surgery. They then underwent radioimmunoguided surgery (RIGS) with maximal resection of tumor. A hand- held gamma-detecting probe (Neoprobe 1000) was used intraoperatively to detect and resect areas of high radioactivity, representing tumor. Areas with persistently high probe counts after resection were the areas of occult residual disease, and represented the CTV to be irradiated. The IORT was given with either 6-9 MeV electron beam from a dedicated linear accelerator, or with high-dose-rate brachytherapy from a remote afterloader. If all RIGS- positive tissue had been resected, or if widely disseminated disease remained, the patient was not considered for IORT. Result(s): This technique was used in 31 patients with colorectal adenocarcinoma recurrent into the pelvis (n = 23) or paraortic nodes (n = 8). The CTV for IORT was delineated by increased RIGS count in 13 of 19 patients (68%) with microscopic residual, and in 11 of 12 patients (92%) with gross residual. In the other 7 patients, the tumor area did not accumulate the radiolabeled antibody; therefore, these tumor beds were irradiated based on the surgeon's estimation of close margins. Hence, overall, the RIG-IORT technique was used to define the tumor bed for IORT in 24 of 31 patients (77%). This technical report focuses on the development of the RIG-IORT technique and does not address the outcome results of the treated patients. Conclusion(s): A new technique, RIG-IORT, which uses radiolabeled monoclonal antibodies to precisely determine the CTV for IORT, is described. Whether the use of this technique will lead to improved tumor control will only be known upon the outcome analysis of RIG-IORT- treated patients compared with those obtained using traditional IORT techniques.",Excluded
