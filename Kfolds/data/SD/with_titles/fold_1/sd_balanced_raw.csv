1713,"DW-MRI-guided dose escalation improves local control of locally advanced nasopharyngeal carcinoma treated with chemoradiotherapy Background: Nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) is one of the most highly radiosensitive malignancies; however, some locally advanced NPC patients experienced local recurrence even though they received aggressive treatment regimens. Defining the tumor volume precisely is important to escalate the total dose required for the primary tumor. In this study, we aimed to investigate the feasibility and efficacy of dose escalation guided by DW-MRI in patients with locally advanced NPC. Patients and Methods: A total of 230 patients with locally advanced NPC treated with intensive modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) at Sichuan Cancer Hospital between January 2010 and January 2015 were enrolled in this retrospective study. All the patients were treated with all-course of simultaneous integrated boost-IMRT. DW-MRI-guided dose escalation with 2.2-2.5 Gy/F, qd for 1-3daysor1.2-1.5 Gy/F, bid for 1-3 days were prescribed to 123 patients. Survival and complication of the patients were evaluated, and multivariate analysis was performed. Result(s): The median follow-up of patients in the DW-MRI-guided dose-escalation group and the conventional group was 48 months (range 8-88 months) and 52 months (range 6-90 months), respectively. The 5-year overall survival rate, distant metastasis-free survival rate, progression-free survival, and local recurrence-free survival (LRFS) of patients in the dose-escalation group and the conventional group were 88% vs 82.5% (p = 0.244), 86.1% vs 83.3% (p = 0.741), 82.2% vs 76.6% (p = 0.286), and 89.1% vs 80.1% (p = 0.029), respectively. Multivariate analysis showed that dose escalation was independent prognostic factor for LRFS (HR 0.386, 95% CI 0.163-0.909, p = 0.03). Conclusion(s): DW-MRI-guided dose escalation is a feasible strategy to improve local control of patients with locally advanced NPC. The treatment-related complications are tolerable.Copyright © 2020 Huang et al.",Excluded
2103,"Definitive radiotherapy with interstitial implant boost for squamous cell carcinoma of the tongue base BACKGROUND: The purpose of this study was to examine the long-term outcome of a cohort of patients with unresected base of tongue carcinoma who received interstitial brachytherapy after comprehensive external beam radiation therapy., METHODS: Between 1983 and 2000, 122 patients with primary or recurrent squamous cell carcinoma of the oropharynx or oral cavity received interstitial brachytherapy as part of their overall management. Forty patients had primary, unresected carcinoma of the base of tongue and are the subjects of this analysis. The median age was 54 years. Fifty-four percent had T3 or T4 disease, and 70% had clinical or radiographic lymphadenopathy. Twenty-four (60%) received two to three cycles of neoadjuvant chemotherapy. The oropharynx, bilateral neck, and supraclavicular fossae were comprehensively irradiated, and the tongue base received a median external beam dose of 61.2 Gy (50-72 Gy). The primary site was then boosted with an interstitial 192Iridium implant by use of a gold-button single-strand technique and three-dimensional treatment planning. The dose rate was prescribed at 0.4 to 0.5 Gy/hr. The median implant dose was 17.4 Gy (9.6-24 Gy) and adjusted to reach a total dose to the primary tumor of 80 Gy. N2 to 3 disease was managed by a planned neck dissection performed at the time of the implant., RESULTS: The median follow-up for all patients was 56 months, and the overall survival rates were 62% at 5 years and 27% at 10 years. The actuarial primary site control was 78% at 5 years and 70% at 10 years. The overall survival and primary site control were independent of T classification, N status, or overall stage. Systemic therapy was associated with an improvement in overall survival (p = .04) and a trend toward increased primary site control with greater clinical response. There were seven documented late effects, the most frequent being grade 3 osteonecrosis (n = 2), grade 2 swallowing dysfunction (n = 2), trismus (n = 2), and chronic throat pain (n = 1)., CONCLUSIONS: In an era of greatly improved dose distributions made possible by three-dimensional treatment planning and intensity-modulated radiation therapy, brachytherapy allows a highly conformal dose to be delivered in sites such as the oropharynx. If done properly, the procedure is safe and delivers a dose that is higher than what can be achieved by external beam radiation alone with the expected biologic advantages. The long-term data presented here support an approach of treating advanced tongue base lesions that includes interstitial brachytherapy as part of the overall management plan. This approach has led to a 78% rate of organ preservation at 5 years, with a 5% incidence of significant late morbidity (osteonecrosis) that has required medical management.

3486,"Three-dimensional anatomic analysis and navigation templates for C1 pedicle screw placement perpendicular to the coronal plane: a retrospective study OBJECTIVE: To explore the corridor for atlas pedicle screw placement perpendicular to the coronal plane and to develop patient-specific navigation templates for pedicle screw placement., METHODS: This study is a retrospective analysis. A total of 71 patients (41 males and 30 females) were involved in this study from June 2016 to June 2018, and they were divided into a template group (39 patients) and a conventional group (32 patients). The CT-based 3D reconstruction models were analyzed in the template group. From the perspective of the 3D atlas in a coronal view, the pedicle corridor was obtained. Taking the center of the tangential circle of the pedicle as the entry point, we simulated screw placement perpendicular to the coronal plane. Then, the individual navigation template was designed and used in surgery. In the conventional group, free-hand pedicle screw placement was performed perpendicular to the coronal plane. The diameter of the maximum tangential circle and screw length of the pedicle corridor were measured in the template group. The surgical time, radiation exposure time, screw grading criteria and so on were evaluated and compared between the two groups after surgery., RESULTS: ;The diameter of the maximum tangential circle and the distance between the entry point and posterior tubercle were significantly greater in males than in females. The operation was successfully completed in all patients, without aggravation of nerve injury, and the follow-up was 12-20 months, with an average of 15.6 months. A total of 78 screws were inserted in the template group, and 64 screws were inserted in the conventional group. The surgical times in the template group and conventional group were 76.47+/-24.44 min and 125.63+/-36.41 min, respectively. The radiation exposure times in the template group and conventional group were 3.51+/-1.77 and 10.15+/-4.95, respectively, and there was a significant difference between the two groups. In the template group, the deviation in the screw entry point and screw angle were 1.92+/-1.67 mm and 2.08+/-1.98degree, respectively. The medial angle deviation between the left and right sides was 2.71+/-1.88degree in the template group, which was significantly less than the deviation of 3.76+/-2.22degree in the conventional group., CONCLUSION: A pedicle screw trajectory perpendicular to the coronal plane can be quickly obtained based on the perspective of 3D models. The technique of screw placement perpendicular to the coronal plane assisted by navigation templates has a shorter operative time, lessintraoperative fluoroscopy and a higher safety of screw placement than traditional surgery.",Excluded
1911,"Wear of high-dose gamma-irradiated polyethylene in total hip replacements Between 1971 and 1978, 62 patients underwent total hip replacements (THRs) with high-dose (100 Mrad) gamma-irradiated polyethylene sockets. After a mean follow-up of 17.3 years (range, 6-23 years), 28 hips in 26 patients were available for radiographic wear measurement. Twenty-three THRs with non- irradiated sockets were used as controls, although all these hips had loosened within 13 years. The rate of linear wear in irradiated sockets was significantly lower throughout the follow-up period (less than 2 years. 0.16 and 0.38 mm/year; 2-6 years, 0.05 and 0.29 mm/year; more than 6 years, 0.05 and 0.28 mm/year, respectively; mean, P < 0.0001). This result has demonstrated that high-dose gamma- irradiated, cross-linked polyethylene is a promising articulating material for THRs.",Excluded
3645,"Feasibility study of single agent cisplatin and concurrent radiotherapy in Japanese patients with squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck: Preliminary results Background: Concurrent chemoradiotherapy with the single agent cisplatin (CDDP + RT) has been recognized worldwide as the standard treatment for unresectable locally advanced SCCHN. The objective of this study was to clarify the feasibility of CDDP + RT in Japanese patients. Patients and Methods: Patients with unresectable squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck were given single daily fractionated radiation (70 Gy at 2 Gy/day) and chemotherapy consisting of a 2 h infusion of CDDP 100 mg/m2 on days 1, 22 and 43. The primary endpoint was the rate of completion of CDDP + RT. Result(s): Between November 2005 and January 2007, 20 patients were enrolled, 19 males and one female with a median age of 61.5 years (range 50-74). One patient had recurrent unresectable disease after surgery and the remaining 19 had stage IV disease. No grade 4 hematologic toxicities were observed. The incidence of grade 3 mucositis was 55% and no treatment-related death occurred. Full-dose irradiation was performed in all patients, with a median duration of radiotherapy of 50 days (range 48-54). Although all patients received the first two administrations of CDDP, the third dose was administed in 17 patients (85%). The rate of completion of CDDP + RT was 85% and the dose intensity of CDDP was 28.9 mg/m2/week (relative dose intensity 89%). Overall complete response rate was 50% and the rate of primary complete response was 90%. Conclusion(s): Concurrent chemoradiation therapy with the standard dose ofCDDP is feasible in Japanese patients. Treatment modification based on racial differences is not necessary. © 2007 Foundation for Promotion of Cancer Research.",Excluded
2472,"Effects of M-current modulators on the excitability of immature rat spinal sensory and motor neurones M-currents have been shown to control neuronal excitability in a variety of central and peripheral neurones. Here we studied the effects of specific M-current modulators on the excitability of spinal neurones and their response to synaptic activation. Experiments were performed in vitro using the hemisected spinal cord from 7- to 11-day-old rats. Intracellular recordings were obtained from lumbar deep dorsal horn and motor neurones. Neuronal excitability was assessed by applying outward current pulses and synaptic responses were elicited by activation of a lumbar dorsal root. The M-current antagonist 10,10-bis(4-pyridinylmethyl)-9(10H)-anthracenone (XE-991) and the agonist retigabine were superfused at 10 microM. Retigabine produced hyperpolarization and a large decrease in the excitability of motor (7/7) and dorsal horn neurones (11/12). The effects of retigabine were fully reversed by XE-991. XE-991 induced depolarization of most neurones tested and a large increase in the excitability of motor neurones (7/7) but only a weak increase in the excitability of a proportion of dorsal horn neurones (4/10). The effects of XE-991 were partly reversed by retigabine. Consistent with their effects on neuronal excitability, retigabine showed a general depressant effect on synaptic transmission, whereas XE-991 showed the opposite tendency to potentiate responses to dorsal root stimulation, particularly in motor neurones. The results show that retigabine can depress spinal excitability and the transmission of nociceptive information. Results also indicate a post-synaptic expression of functional M-currents in most motor neurones and a considerable proportion of deep dorsal horn neurones.",Excluded
1938,"Present status and self-reported diseases of the Korean atomic bomb survivors: a mail questionnaire survey Many Koreans were forced to move to Japan while Korea was occupied by Japan. Consequently, when the atomic bombs were dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki an estimated 40,000 Koreans died and 30,000 survived. In 2004, 2,235 Koreans were registered as A-bomb survivors in South Korea. A mail questionnaire survey to evaluate the present status and self-reported diseases of the Korean survivors was conducted. In total, 1,256 questionnaires were returned and analysed. The most frequent chronic diseases reported by Korean survivors were hypertension (40.1 per cent), peptic ulcer disease (25.7 per cent), anaemia (23.3 per cent) and cataracts (23.1 per cent). The most frequent malignant diseases were stomach cancer (1.9 per cent), colon cancer (0.5 per cent) and leukaemia/multiple myeloma (0.4 per cent). This study suggests that further investigations are needed into the health concerns of the survivors and into health protection measures.",Excluded
2946,"Radon testing in rapid access lung clinics: an opportunity for secondary prevention Background: Radon is a naturally occurring radioactive gas and a level 1 carcinogen. It acts synergistically with cigarette smoke to cause lung cancer. In Ireland, radon is estimated to be associated with 13 % of all lung cancers. Rapid access lung cancer clinics (RALC's) were established in the UK and Ireland to improve lung cancer management outcomes. There has been no attempt to date to provide advice on household radon exposure assessments in this setting. Aim(s): We performed a prospective feasibility study of radon assessment in our RALC to test the hypothesis that patients would avail of this service and that it would provide an opportunity for secondary prevention in at risk persons. Method(s): We investigated household radon levels in consecutive patients who were newly referred with symptoms of lung cancer to the RALC in Galway University Hospital, Ireland over a 6-month period. Result(s): Of 50 patients enrolled, 42 returned valid results. Overall 21 % of patients had radon levels recorded above the national reference level. Only 5 % of patients were aware of the association between radon gas and lung cancer. Smokers were significantly less likely to engage fully in radon testing. Conclusion(s): The development of RALC's offers a novel opportunity to integrate the concepts of radon exposure, cigarette smoking and the development of lung cancer, and to reinforce this message in the minds of at risk patients.Copyright © 2016, Royal Academy of Medicine in Ireland.",Excluded

3561,"Augmented fluoroscopic bronchoscopy (AFB) versus percutaneous computed tomography-guided dye localization for thoracoscopic resection of small lung nodules: a propensity-matched study BACKGROUND: Dye localization is a useful method for the resection of unidentifiable small pulmonary lesions. This study compares the transbronchial route with augmented fluoroscopic bronchoscopy (AFB) and conventional transthoracic CT-guided methods for preoperative dye localization in thoracoscopic surgery., METHODS: Between April 2015 and March 2019, a total of 231 patients with small pulmonary lesions who received preoperative dye localization via AFB or percutaneous CT-guided technique were enrolled in the study. A propensity-matched analysis, incorporating preoperative variables, was used to compare localization and surgical outcomes between the two groups., RESULTS: After matching, a total of 90 patients in the AFB group (N = 30) and CT-guided group (N = 60) were selected for analysis. No significant difference was noted in the demographic data between both the groups. Dye localization was successfully performed in 29 patients (96.7%) and 57 patients (95%) with AFB and CT-guided method, respectively. The localization duration (24.1 +/- 8.3 vs. 21.4 +/- 12.5 min, p = 0.297) and equivalent dose of radiation exposure (3.1 +/- 1.5 vs. 2.5 +/- 2.0 mSv, p = 0.130) were comparable in both the groups. No major procedure-related complications occurred in either group; however, a higher rate of pneumothorax (0 vs. 16.7%, p = 0.029) and focal intrapulmonary hemorrhage (3.3 vs. 26.7%, p = 0.008) was noted in the CT-guided group., CONCLUSION: AFB dye marking is an effective alternative for the preoperative localization of small pulmonary lesions, with a lower risk of procedure-related complications than the conventional CT-guided method.",Excluded
781,"Cognitive and radiological effects of radiotherapy in patients with low-grade glioma: long-term follow-up BACKGROUND: Our previous study on cognitive functioning among 195 patients with low-grade glioma (LGG) a mean of 6 years after diagnosis suggested that the tumour itself, rather than the radiotherapy used to treat it, has the most deleterious effect on cognitive functioning; only high fraction dose radiotherapy (>2 Gy) resulted in significant added cognitive deterioration. The present study assesses the radiological and cognitive abnormalities in survivors of LGG at a mean of 12 years after first diagnosis., METHODS: Patients who have had stable disease since the first assessment were invited for follow-up cognitive assessment (letter-digit substitution test, concept shifting test, Stroop colour-word test, visual verbal learning test, memory comparison test, and categoric word fluency). Compound scores in six cognitive domains (attention, executive functioning, verbal memory, working memory, psychomotor functioning, and information processing speed) were calculated to detect differences between patients who had radiotherapy and patients who did not have radiotherapy. White-matter hyperintensities and global cortical atrophy were rated on MRI scans., FINDINGS: 65 patients completed neuropsychological follow-up at a mean of 12 years (range 6-28 years). 32 (49%) patients had received radiotherapy (three had fraction doses >2 Gy). The patients who had radiotherapy had more deficits that affected attentional functioning at the second follow-up, regardless of fraction dose, than those who did not have radiotherapy (-1.6 [SD 2.4] vs -0.1 [1.3], p=0.003; mean difference 1.4, 95% CI 0.5-2.4). The patients who had radiotherapy also did worse in measures of executive functioning (-2.0 [3.7] vs -0.5 [1.2], p=0.03; mean difference 1.5, 0.2-2.9) and information processing speed (-2.0 [3.7] vs -0.6 [1.5], p=0.05; mean difference 0.8, 0.009-1.6]) between the two assessments. Furthermore, attentional functioning deteriorated significantly between the first and second assessments in patients who had radiotherapy (p=0.25). In total, 17 (53%) patients who had radiotherapy developed cognitive disabilities deficits in at least five of 18 neuropsychological test parameters compared with four (27%) patients who were radiotherapy naive. White-matter hyperintensities and global cortical atrophy were associated with worse cognitive functioning in several domains., INTERPRETATION: Long-term survivors of LGG who did not have radiotherapy had stable radiological and cognitive status. By contrast, patients with low-grade glioma who received radiotherapy showed a progressive decline in attentional functioning, even those who received fraction doses that are regarded as safe (</=2 Gy). These cognitive deficits are associated with radiological abnormalities. Our results suggest that the risk of long-term cognitive and radiological compromise that is associated with radiotherapy should be considered when treatment is planned., FUNDING: Kaptein Fonds; Schering Plough.",Included
2580,"Multidetector row computed tomography of acute pancreatitis: Utility of single portal phase CT scan in short-term follow up Objective: The purpose of this study is to evaluate the question of whether nonenhanced CT or contrast enhanced portal phase CT can replace multiphasic pancreas protocol CT in short term monitoring in patients with acute pancreatitis. Material(s) and Method(s): This retrospective study was approved by the Institutional Review Board. From April 2006 to May 2010, a total of 52 patients having acute pancreatitis who underwent initial dual phase multidetector row CT (unenhanced, arterial, and portal phase) at admission and a short term (within 30 days) follow up dual phase CT (mean interval 10.3 days, range 3-28 days) were included. Two abdominal radiologists performed an independent review of three sets of follow up CT images (nonenhanced scan, single portal phase scan, and dual phase scan). Interpretation of each image set was done with at least 2-week interval. Radiologists evaluated severity of acute pancreatitis with regard to pancreatic inflammation, pancreatic necrosis, and extrapancreatic complication, based on the modified CT severity index. Scores of each image set were compared using a paired t-test and interobserver agreement was evaluated using intraclass correlation coefficient statistics. Result(s): Mean scores of sum of CT severity index on nonenhanced scan, portal phase scan, and dual phase scan were 5.7, 6.6, and 6.5 for radiologist 1, and 5.0, 5.6, and 5.8 for radiologist 2, respectively. In both radiologists, contrast enhanced scan (portal phase scan and dual phase scan) showed significantly higher severity score compared with that of unenhanced scan (P < 0.05), while portal phase and dual phase scan showed no significant difference each other. The trend was similar regarding pancreatic inflammation and extrapancreatic complications, in which contrast enhanced scans showed significantly higher score compared with those of unenhanced scan, while no significant difference was observed between portal phase scan and dual phase scan. In pancreatic necrosis analysis, there was no significant difference between the three image sets for both radiologists. However, when only the patients having pancreatic necrosis (n = 13) was separately analyzed, significant differences were observed between the unenhanced and portal phase scan (P = 0.04, for radiologist 1), or unenhanced and dual phase scan (P = 0.013, for radiologist 2). Conclusion(s): For short-term follow up imaging in assessment of patients with acute pancreatitis, single portal phase CT images without adding unenhanced or arterial phase images provide sufficient information, and thereby reduce radiation exposure. © 2011 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.",Excluded
1698,"Transradial and transulnar access for iliac artery interventions using sheathless guiding systems: A feasibility study Purpose: Our aim was to evaluate the acute success and complication rates of the transradial and transulnar access for iliac artery stenting using sheathless guiding systems. Method(s): Clinical and angiographic data from 156 consecutive patients with symptomatic iliac artery stenosis who were treated with transradial or transulnar access were evaluated. All patients underwent Duplex ultrasound before and after the intervention. The primary endpoints were the procedural success rate, major adverse events, and access site complication rates. The secondary endpoints were the angiographic result of the iliac artery intervention, fluoroscopy time, X-ray dose, procedure length, crossover rate to another puncture site and hospitalization duration. The impact of the learning curve was also investigated, along with right or left radial access. Result(s): The indication for the intervention was intermittent claudication in 109 patients (69.9%), critical limb ischemia in 44 (28.2%) subjects and acute limb ischemia in three individuals (1.9%). Technical success was achieved in 155 patients (99.4%), with a crossover rate of 3.8%. Radial and ulnar artery access was used in 151 (96.8%) and 7 (4.5%) patients, respectively. The Ankle-brachial index increased from 0.69 [0.65-0.72] to 0.91 [0.88-0.95] as a result of the procedures (P < 0.001). The cumulative incidence of major adverse events was 3.8% at the 2-month follow-up (0% in patients with intermittent claudication and 13.8% in patients with critical limb ischemia). Radial artery access site complications were encountered in eight patients (5.1%). We documented decreased X-ray doses (1742.0 [783.9-2701] vs. 1435 [991.1-1879] vs. 692.8 [275.3-1110] Gy cm-2 P < 0.05) over time; however, the fluoroscopy time, procedure time, and contrast consumption were not significantly different. Left hand access was not associated with significantly better results than right radial artery access. Conclusion(s): Iliac artery stenting can be safely and effectively performed using radial or ulnar artery access and sheathless guiding catheters, with acceptable complication rates and high levels of technical success. The physician learning curve plays an important role in decreasing the X-ray dose. © 2016 The Authors.

468,"The tumor-stroma ratio is an independent predictor for survival in nasopharyngeal cancer Background: The tumor-stroma ratio (TSR) has been identified as a new and practicable prognostic histological characteristic of solid tumors. The aim of this study was to evaluate the prognostic value of the TSR in nasopharyngeal cancer (NPC). Patients and Methods: A total of 93 patients who presented with NPC from 2004 to 2007 were studied. Radiotherapy with or without chemotherapy was administered according to their Union for International Cancer Control (UICC) stages. The TSR was assessed visually on hematoxylin and eosin-stained tissue sections of biopsy specimens by 2 independent observers. Result(s): The 5-year overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS) rates were 66.67% and 54.91%, respectively, in the stroma-poor group and 40.48% and 33.33%, respectively, in the stroma-rich group. Both the 5-year OS and DFS rates in the stroma-poor group were significantly better than those in the stroma-rich group (p < 0.05). In a multivariate analysis, the TSR was identified as a highly significant prognostic factor for the 5-year OS (hazard ratio (HR) 1.999; p = 0.030) and the 5-year DFS (HR 1.925; p = 0.042).

The first 10 patients with a minimum follow-up of 3 months were analyzed. All tumors were oropharyngeal. There were four females and six males, with a mean age of 50 years (range 39-66). Stages were I-II in eight and III-IV in two. CTV1 was microscopic disease and N0 neck (prescribed dose : 50 Gy) and CTV2 was macroscopic disease and the volume at risk (prescribed dose: 66-70 Gy). PTV were CTV + 5 mm. Patient's immobilization consisted of a five-point head neck shoulder thermoplastic mask. Set-up verifications were done by semi-automatically matching portal images and digitized reconstructed radiographs. IMRT used dynamic multileaf collimation. Five patients (group A) received 50 Gy IMRT (two post-operative and three with a brachytherapy boost with a mean dose: 27.5 Gy), and five patients (group B) received 66-70 Gy IMRT (four post-operative). Acute and late normal tissue effects were graded according to the RTOG-EORTC radiation morbidity scoring criteria., RESULTS: With a median follow-up of 7.4 months (range 3-18.5), no patient died or had loco-regional relapse. The displacements were <4 mm in 98% cases. CTV1 and 2 received 95% of the prescribed dose in 100% of the volume. On average the mean dose to the contralateral parotid was 25.5 Gy for group A vs. 31 Gy for group B (P = 0.09). Mean doses <26 Gy were obtained in three of five patients in group A vs. zero of five patients in group B (P = 0.04). Acute skin toxicities were grade 1 in five patients, grade 2 in four and grade 3 in one. Acute mucositis cases were grade 1 in three patients, grade 2 in five and localized grade 3 in two. At 3 months, 50% of the patients had a grade 0-1 late xerostomia., CONCLUSION: The 26 Gy dose limit constraint to the contralateral parotid was easier to satisfy when IMRT was prescribed at a maximum dose of 50 Gy. Acute toxicity is low. The displacements in the mask indicate that it is possible to define the PTV as CTV + 4 mm. This reduction should decrease the mean dose to the parotids. At 3 months, a 50% rate of grade 0-1 late xerostomia encourages the hope of a very low rate at 2 years.",Excluded
877,"Gamma radiation tolerance in different life stages of the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster PURPOSE: Insects are known to have higher levels of radiation tolerance than mammals. The fruit fly Drosophila provides opportunities for genetic analysis of radiation tolerance in insects. A knowledge of stage-specific sensitivity is required to understand the mechanisms and test the existing hypothesis of insect radiation tolerance., MATERIALS AND METHODS: Drosophila melanogaster were irradiated using gamma rays at different life stages. Irradiation doses were chosen to start from 100-2200 Gy with increments of 100 Gy, with a dose rate of 12.5 and 25 Gy/min. The threshold of mortality, LD50 and LD100 1 h post-irradiation was recorded for larvae and adults and 24 h post-irradiation for eggs and after 2-3 days for early and late pupae. Total antioxidant capacity for all the life stages was measured using the phosphomolybdenum method., RESULTS: Twenty-four hours post-irradiation, 100% mortality was recorded for eggs at 1000 Gy. One hour post irradiation 100% mortality was recorded at 1300 Gy for first instar larvae, 1700 Gy for second instar larvae, 1900 Gy for feeding third instar larvae and 2200 Gy for non-feeding third instar larvae. Post-irradiation complete failure of emergence (100% mortality) was observed at 130 Gy for early pupae and 1500 Gy for late pupae; 100% mortality was observed at 1500 Gy for adults. The values of LD50 were recorded as 452 Gy for eggs, 1049 Gy for first instar larvae, 1350 Gy for second instar larvae, 1265 Gy for feeding third instar larvae, 1590 Gy for non-feeding third instar larvae, 50 Gy for early pupae, 969 Gy for late pupae, 1228 Gy for adult males and 1250 Gy for adult females., CONCLUSIONS: Early pupae were found to be prone to radiation, whereas the non-feeding third instar larvae were most resistant among all stages. The chromosome number being constant and total antioxidant capacity being nearly constant in all stages, we suggest that high rate of cell division during early pupae makes this stage sensitive to radiation.",Included
3149,"Analysis by alkaline comet assay of cancer patients with severe reactions to radiotherapy: Defective rejoining of radioinduced DNA strand breaks in lymphocytes of breast cancer patients Therapeutic exposure to ionising radiation reveals inter-individual variations in normal tissue responses. To examine whether a defect in DNA repair capacity might be involved in such hypersensitive phenotypes, we analysed, using the alkaline comet assay, the response as a function of time to in vitro irradiation at 5 Gy of lymphocytes from 17 breast cancer and 9 Hodgkin's disease patients who developed severe reactions to radiotherapy in comparison with 22 patients with 'average' reactions and 24 healthy donors. A difference between breast cancer over-reactors and both patients with normal reactions and healthy donors was observed 30 and 60 min after exposure. A subgroup of breast cancer over-reactors (7/17) reproducibly demonstrated increased levels of residual damage. When the kinetic analyses were prolonged to 120 min, results were in favour of delayed kinetics of rejoining in these patients. Among Hodgkin's disease over-reactors, only one patient showed defective repair. Interestingly, all patients with the most severe complications (grade 4 RTOG/EORTC), i.e., 5 breast cancer and 1 Hodgkin's disease, showed impaired rejoining. Our results suggest that impairment in DNA strand break processing may be associated, in specific subgroups of breast cancer patients, with an individual risk of major toxicity of radiation therapy. Thus, the alkaline comet assay appears to be useful for documenting the DNA repair phenotype in cancer patients.",Included

489,"CT urography in the urinary bladder: to compare excretory phase images using a low noise index and a high noise index with adaptive noise reduction filter BACKGROUND: Although CT urography (CTU) is widely used for the evaluation of the entire urinary tract, the most important drawback is the radiation exposure., PURPOSE: To evaluate the effect of a noise reduction filter (NRF) using a phantom and to quantitatively and qualitatively compare excretory phase (EP) images using a low noise index (NI) with those using a high NI and postprocessing NRF (pNRF)., MATERIAL AND METHODS: Each NI value was defined for a slice thickness of 5 mm, and reconstructed images with a slice thickness of 1.25 mm were assessed. Sixty patients who were at high risk of developing bladder tumors (BT) were divided into two groups according to whether their EP images were obtained using an NI of 9.88 (29 patients; group A) or an NI of 20 and pNRF (31 patients; group B). The CT dose index volume (CTDI(vol)) and the contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR) of the bladder with respect to the anterior pelvic fat were compared in both groups. Qualitative assessment of the urinary bladder for image noise, sharpness, streak artifacts, homogeneity, and the conspicuity of polypoid or sessile-shaped BTs with a short-axis diameter greater than 10 mm was performed using a 3-point scale., RESULTS: The phantom study showed noise reduction of approximately 40% and 76% dose reduction between group A and group B. CTDI(vol) demonstrated a 73% reduction in group B (4.6 +/- 1.1 mGy) compared with group A (16.9 +/- 3.4 mGy). The CNR value was not significantly different (P = 0.60) between group A (16.1 +/- 5.1) and group B (16.6 +/- 7.6). Although group A was superior (P < 0.01) to group B with regard to image noise, other qualitative analyses did not show significant differences., CONCLUSION: EP images using a high NI and pNRF were quantitatively and qualitatively comparable to those using a low NI, except with regard to image noise.",Excluded
1764,"Image quality of iterative reconstruction in cranial CT imaging: comparison of model-based iterative reconstruction (MBIR) and adaptive statistical iterative reconstruction (ASiR) Objectives: The purpose of this study was to compare cranial CT (CCT) image quality (IQ) of the MBIR algorithm with standard iterative reconstruction (ASiR)., Methods: In this institutional review board (IRB)-approved study, raw data sets of 100 unenhanced CCT examinations (120 kV, 50-260 mAs, 20 mm collimation, 0.984 pitch) were reconstructed with both ASiR and MBIR. Signal-to-noise (SNR) and contrast-to-noise (CNR) were calculated from attenuation values measured in caudate nucleus, frontal white matter, anterior ventricle horn, fourth ventricle, and pons. Two radiologists, who were blinded to the reconstruction algorithms, evaluated anonymized multiplanar reformations of 2.5 mm with respect to depiction of different parenchymal structures and impact of artefacts on IQ with a five-point scale (0: unacceptable, 1: less than average, 2: average, 3: above average, 4: excellent)., Results: MBIR decreased artefacts more effectively than ASiR (p < 0.01). The median depiction score for MBIR was 3, whereas the median value for ASiR was 2 (p < 0.01). SNR and CNR were significantly higher in MBIR than ASiR (p < 0.01)., Conclusions: MBIR showed significant improvement of IQ parameters compared to ASiR. As CCT is an examination that is frequently required, the use of MBIR may allow for substantial reduction of radiation exposure caused by medical diagnostics.Copyright © 2014, European Society of Radiology.",Excluded
3255,"Evaluation of endogenous control gene(s) for gene expression studies in human blood exposed to 60Co gamma-rays ex vivo In gene expression studies, it is critical to normalize data using a stably expressed endogenous control gene in order to obtain accurate and reliable results. However, we currently do not have a universally applied endogenous control gene for normalization of data for gene expression studies, particularly those involving (60)Co gamma-ray-exposed human blood samples. In this study, a comparative assessment of the gene expression of six widely used housekeeping endogenous control genes, namely 18S, ACTB, B2M, GAPDH, MT-ATP6 and CDKN1A, was undertaken for a range of (60)Co gamma-ray doses (0.5, 1.0, 2.0 and 4.0 Gy) at 8.4 Gy min(-1) at 0 and 24 h post-irradiation time intervals. Using the NormFinder algorithm, real-time PCR data obtained from six individuals (three males and three females) were analyzed with respect to the threshold cycle (Ct) value and abundance, DELTACt pair-wise comparison, intra- and inter-group variability assessments, etc. GAPDH, either alone or in combination with 18S, was found to be the most suitable endogenous control gene and should be used in gene expression studies, especially those involving qPCR of gamma-ray-exposed human blood samples.

807,"Reanalysis of Hanford data: 1944-1986 deaths Reanalysis of Hanford data by a method, which is new only in the sense that it makes new uses of standard epidemiological procedures, has produced evidence of a cancer risk at low dose levels. By a conservative estimate, about three per cent of the pre-1987 cancer deaths of Hanford workers had occupational exposures to external radiation as the critical (induction) event. These radiogenic cancers were evenly distributed between five diagnostic groups, but as a result of there being much greater sensitivity to cancer induction by radiation"" after, rather than before, 50 years of age, they were concentrated among the cancers which proved fatal after 70 years of age. The reanalysis provides no support for the idea that radiation is more likely to cause leukemia than solid tumors, or the idea that there is reduced cancer effectiveness of radiation at low dose levels (dose rate effectiveness factor or DREF hypothesis), but the estimated proportion of radiogenic cancers was much higher for the 175 nonfatal cancers (which had other certified causes of death) than for the 1,732 fatal cases. Finally, according to the latest publication of the US Committee on Biological Effects of Ionizing Radiation (BEIR V), dose rate is more important than exposure age, and even a single exposure to 10 rem would only increase the normal cancer risk by four percent. Nevertheless, for all recorded exposures of Hanford workers, the estimated doubling dose was close to 26 rem; for exposures after 58 years, it was close to 5 rem, and for exposures after 62 years, it was less than 1 rem.""",Excluded

3015,"Image quality from high-resolution CT of the lung: comparison of axial scans and of sections reconstructed from volumetric data acquired using MDCT OBJECTIVE: Our objective was to compare the image quality of reconstructed thin sections obtained from a 16-MDCT scanner with that of axial high-resolution CT scans of the same patient. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: Fifty consecutive patients referred for CT of the chest underwent 16-MDCT and, subsequently, axial high-resolution CT. The volumetric raw data from the MDCT scans were reconstructed into slices 2-mm thick using a high-spatial-frequency reconstruction algorithm. Two blinded reviewers independently rated the images from both methods for subjective image-quality criteria. The results were tested for statistical significance using Wilcoxon's signed rank test, and p values of less than 0.05 were considered significant. The effective dose for axial high-resolution CT and volumetric MDCT was calculated. RESULT(S): Motion artifacts were significantly more common on high-resolution CT scans than on reconstructed thin-section images (p < 0.001). The two methods differed significantly in lung attenuation (p = 0.008), mainly because of the presence of ground-glass opacities. The assessment of ground-glass attenuation was superior on axial high-resolution CT. The effective doses were 3.8 mSv for MDCT and 0.9 mSv for high-resolution CT. CONCLUSION(S): Reconstructed high-resolution images generated from a single MDCT data acquisition are of comparable quality to images obtained using conventional axial high-resolution CT. However, contiguous MDCT is not recommended for diseases showing predominantly ground-glass patterns, because axial high-resolution CT delineates ground-glass attenuation significantly better.",Excluded
87,"The QUANTEC criteria for parotid gland dose and their efficacy to prevent moderate to severe patient-rated xerostomia Background. Recently, the Quantitative Analysis of Normal Tissue Effect in the Clinic (QUANTEC) Group defined dose-volume constraints for the parotid glands to avoid severe xerostomia. The aim of this study was to determine if application of these QUANTEC criteria also protected against moderate-to-severe patient-rated xerostomia. Material and methods. The study population consisted of 307 head and neck cancer patients treated with primary (chemo)radiotherapy, either with 3D-CRT (56%) or with IMRT (44%). All patients participated in a standard follow-up program in which radiation-induced toxicity and quality of life were prospectively assessed. Patients who met the QUANTEC criteria were classified as low risk and otherwise as high risk. Results. In total, 41% of the patients (treated with 3D-CRT and IMRT) were classified as low risk patients. In the group treated with 3D-CRT and IMRT, it was possible to meet the QUANTEC criteria in 47% and 32% of the patients, respectively. Sparing the parotid glands with IMRT was considerably more difficult in patients with lymph node metastases and in patients with nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal tumours. Low risk patients reported significantly less moderate-to-severe xerostomia than high risk patients. However, the predicted risk of elderly patients and patients with pre-existing minor patient-rated xerostomia at baseline was > 20%, even when the QUANTEC criteria were met. Conclusions. Significantly lower rates of radiation-induced patient-rated xerostomia were found among low risk patients treated according to the QUANTEC criteria, but these criteria do not completely protect against xerostomia. Particularly in elderly patients and patients already suffering from minor xerostomia at baseline, the QUANTEC criteria do not sufficiently protect against persistent, moderate-to-severe patient-rated xerostomia. © 2014 Informa Healthcare.",Excluded
2982,"Health profiles of 996 melanoma survivors: The M. D. Anderson experience Background: The incidence and survival of melanoma are increasing, but little is known about its long-term health effects in adult survivors. Method(s): A health survey was available from 996 melanoma survivors (577 treated with surgery alone, and 391 with combined treatments). Their medical/physiologic and psychosocial responses were analyzed and compared with those of the survivors from other cancers. Result(s): The melanoma survivors were 44.8 +/- 12.8 years of age at diagnosis (significantly younger than the survivors of other cancers) and 63.7 +/- 12.8 years at survey. Melanoma survivors were less likely to report that cancer had affected their health than survivors of other cancers (15.8% vs. 34.9%). The 577 individuals treated with surgery alone reported arthritis/osteoporosis, cataracts, and heart problems most frequently (less often than survivors of other cancers). The 391 individuals who had undergone combined treatments reported circulation problems and kidney problems generally as often as survivors of other cancers. Health problems were not associated with number of decades since diagnosis but with age at diagnosis, treatment modality, and family relationships. Conclusion(s): We present information from a large cohort of long-term survivors of melanoma. As a group, they were less likely to report that cancer had affected their overall health than survivors of other cancers; a number of disease related and psychosocial factors appear to influence their health profiles. © 2006 Stava et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",Excluded

Method(s): A total of 40 complete maxillary dentures wearers studied in this cross-sectional study. Dentures were then randomly divided into two groups. In first group as the control group no intervention was made. Dentures of the second group merely exposed to laser irradiation by the diode laser with wavelength of 940 nm with 100mW for 30 seconds on mucosal surface of dentures before delivery. Samples were collected from the mucosal surface of upper dentures on the determined days. All collected colonies were counted. Clinical outcome was evaluated regarding the colonization of Candida albicans reported by CFU. Difference of colony counts results between two groups was evaluated by Mann-Whitney test. Statistical significance was assumed if p<0.05. Result(s): The results showed laser irradiation was significantly effective in reducing candida colonization. The lower density of the colonies was seen in laser group in compare with control group on 15th and 60th days after denture delivery (P=0.002) & (P=0.003), respectively. Conclusion(s): generalization our data into the clinical setting, it can be proposed that a direct laser-based approach can significantly reduce the colonization of Candida albicans. It can also be concluded that laser light at specific wavelengths could be a possible promising novel strategy for prevention of denture stomatitis.Copyright © 2021 Lahore Medical And Dental College.

Material(s) and Method(s): Ninety newly diagnosed head and neck cancer patients (T1-3, N0-2c, M0) treated with intensity modulated radiotherapy on a prospective clinical trial were assessed for salivary toxicity at predefined intervals using dynamic salivary scintigraphy. The SMG function was measured using salivary excretion fraction (SEF) ratios at baseline and 6 monthly. Tolerance dose (TD) 50 for submandibular gland was estimated from dose response curves. Result(s): The mean SEF ratio of 180 SMGs decreased at 6 months with a nadir at 12 months after treatment (SEF ratio 15%) and progressively recovered over time reaching 38% over 24 months. There was significant inverse correlation between SEF ratio and mean SMG dose at 6 months (r = -0.18, p = 0.04); 12-months (r = -0.36, p < 0.001); 18-months (r = -0.48, p < 0.001); 24-months (r = -0.42, p < 0.001); and more than 24-months (r = -0.56, p < 0.001). The estimated TD 50 values at 1 year and 2 year post treatment were 36 Gy and 44 Gy respectively with SEF ratio of <=45% used to define severe xerostomia. For every 1 Gy reduction in mean dose below 54 Gy, there is 2-2.5% reduction in the probability of severe xerostomia. Conclusion(s): The submandibular gland function declines after radiotherapy with a nadir at 12 months and there is incomplete recovery over time with continued improvement over 24 months. The TD 50 at 1 year and 2 year was 36 Gy and 44 Gy with a 2-2.5% reduction in the probability of severe xerostomia for every 1 Gy reduction in mean dose.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier B.V.",Excluded
2949,"Biopsy of peripheral lung nodules utilizing cone beam computer tomography with and without trans bronchial access tool: A retrospective analysis Background: Currently there are several techniques for endoscopic diagnosis of parenchymal lung abnormalities. Electromagnetic navigation with or without endobronchial ultrasound for diagnosis of the above has been well described. Bronchoscopic Trans Bronchial Access Tool is a novel endoscopic technique that creates a virtual pathway to the lesion and is less limited by location of the airway. The CrossCountryTM Transbronchial Access Tool (CovidienTM, Plymouth, MN, USA) is a Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved off airway device that utilizes a catheter equipped guide sheath for a trans-parenchymal approach to a distal lesion. Cone beam computer tomography (CBCT) is a real-time onsite extrathoracic navigational modality used in the bronchoscopy suite that allows for an open working channel. All three of the above modalities can have reasonable diagnostic yields when used independently. While utilizing the above tools we frequently found ourselves in situations where one technique was not enough, prompting the use of a combination of modalities to obtain the most efficient and accurate diagnosis. We are reporting the feasibility and safety of utilizing these three modalities in conjunction with one another. Method(s): Patients with peripheral pulmonary nodules on chest computed tomography underwent a navigation bronchoscopy under general anesthesia. CBCT and radial ultrasound was used in every case to confirm navigation to the target lesion. Lesions without definitive airways leading to them were accessed with the transbronchial access tool (TBAT). Result(s): Electromagnetic bronchoscopy using CBCT and radial US was performed on 22 patients from April 2016 to September 2016. The TBAT tool was used in 7 patients. The overall diagnostic yield was 77.2% (17 of 22). Diagnostic yield of with use TBAT was 100% (7 of 7). There were no complications. Average case length was 79.95 (range, 50-124) minutes and average fluoroscopy time was 10.39 (1-21.7) minutes. Conclusion(s): TBAT is a useful and safe tool when accessing peripheral pulmonary nodules and is used in conjunctions with electromagnetic navigation and CBCT.Copyright © Journal of Thoracic Disease.

Thirty emergency physicians were enrolled in the study. Initial d2 test was applied in the evaluation of attention and concentration of all the physicians, who were randomly assigned into one of two groups. The control group members hold mobile phones in 'off' mode to their left ears for 15min. The members of the intervention group hold mobile phones in 'on' mode to their left ears for 15min, thus exposing them to 900-1800MHz EMW. The d2 test was re-applied to both groups after this procedure. Differences in attention and concentration levels between the groups were compared., RESULTS: Difference between initial and final d2 test in total performance (TN-E, p=0.319), in total number of figures marked (TN, p=0.177), in test performance percentile (PR, p=0.619) and in attention fluctuation (FR, p=0.083) were similar between the groups.

PURPOSE: GOG 205 safely increased clinical (cCR) and pathologic complete response (pCR) in locally-advanced vulvar cancer through dose escalation using three-dimensional radiotherapy (RT). The aim of this study is to assess the response of dose-escalated intensity modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) in locally-advanced vulvar cancer., METHODS: A retrospective review of patients treated with dose-escalated (>= 55Gy) IMRT from 2012 to 2018 for locally-advanced vulvar cancer was performed. Patients treated with preoperative or definitive intent were included. Rates of cCR and pCR were assessed, and predictors of disease-free survival (DFS) were analyzed using the Kaplan Meier method with log rank test between groups and a parsimonious multivariate Cox model., RESULTS: Median dose to the vulva was 66.0 Gy (Interquartile Range [IQR]: 66.0-68.0) for definitive and 59.4 Gy (IQR: 58.0-59.4) for preoperative IMRT. The overall rates of cCR and pCR were 76% and 70%, respectively. DFS at two years was 65% (95% Confidence Interval [CI] 50-80%) for all patients, 81% (95% CI 63% - 98%) for definitive IMRT, and 55% (95% CI 35% - 76%) for preoperative IMRT. On multivariate analysis, cCR predicted for disease-free survival (HR 0.21; 95% CI 0.06-0.76; p = 0.02), and pCR predicted for OS (HR 0.12; 95% CI 0.02-0.60; p = 0.01).

In this study we have evaluated the incidence of thyroid and parathyroid dysfunction in long term survivors of SCT attending a dedicated haematology/ endocrine follow-up clinic. All patients were transplanted for haematological malignancy and had total body irradiation (TBI) as part of their pre-transplant conditioning regimen. 76 patients (37 female) were investigated a median of 18 years post SCT (range 8-29). The median dose of TBI was 12Gy (range 10-14) given in conjunction with cyclophosphamide. 61 patients were treated for CML and 15 patients were treated for acute leukemia. 21 out of 76 patients (28%) developed hypothyroidism and there were no cases of hyperthyroidism. Among male patients the prevalence was 26% compared to <1% in normal populations. Among women the prevalence was 30% compared to a normal prevalence of 0.1-2%. The median time after SCT that hypothyroidism developed was 13 years but the range was wide at 4.5-24 years. None of our patients had laboratory evidence of hypoparathyroidism (low calcium with inappropriately non-elevated PTH). 16 patients had a raised PTH level. Of these, 12/16 had a calcium level in the lower end of the normal range (2.16-2.4 mmol/l) making primary hyperparathyroidism unlikely. The majority (11/12) of these patients had low vitamin D levels making secondary hyperparathyroidism the most likely diagnosis. Of four patients with elevated PTH and calcium levels >2.4 mmol/ l, none had convincing evidence of primary hyperparathyroidism. One patient had renal impairment and secondary/tertiary hyperparathyroidism; a second was taking bendrofluazide; a third was vitamin D deficient. A fourth patient was hypocalciuric with a 24 hour urinary calcium/creatinine ratio <0.01; this excludes primary hyperparathyroidism and makes the diagnosis of familial hypocalciuric hypercalcemia likely. In summary, there was a high prevalence of hypothyroidism (28%) among our patients. Conversely there were no cases of primary hyperparathyroidism or hypoparathyroidism but longer follow up will be necessary to clarify the effect of these doses of TBI on parathyroid function. Secondary hyperparathyroidism was frequent, particularly in association with low vitamin D levels. We conclude that indefinite surveillance is needed to identify thyroid dysfunction after SCT and vitamin D levels should be part of routine annual follow up investigations.",Excluded

All these employees are known to have been involved in dealing with the fire itself, or in the clean-up operation afterwards. The size of the study population is small, leading to predicted low power to reveal any effects, but the cohort is of interest because of the involvement of the workers in the accident. For 1957-97, using rates for England and Wales to calculate the expected numbers, the all causes standardised mortality ratio (SMR) is 100 (observed = 258, expected = 258.80), and the all malignant neoplasms SMR is 79 (observed = 58, expected = 73.12) which is not significantly different from 100. For 1971-91, the all malignant neoplasms standardised registration ratio (SRR) of 85 (observed = 59, expected = 69.23) is not significantly different from 100. Significant excesses of deaths from diseases of the circulatory system (SMR = 121) and from ischaemic heart disease (SMR = 128), and a significant deficit of deaths from cancer of the genito-urinary organs (SMR = 31), were found. There were no significant differences in mortality rates between workers who had received high recorded external doses during the fire and those who had received low doses, though the power of this comparison was low.

1080,"Enumeration of circulating microparticles in healthy medical workers occupationally exposed to low doses of ionizing radiation Background: Strong evidence suggests microparticles (MP) as a biomarker of vascular injury. It may also contribute to the initiation and the development of atherosclerosis. In fact, several biological mechanisms might be responsible of atherosclerosis caused by radiation exposure even at a low dose. Therefore, the measurement of MP might be of a great potential for providing new insight into low-dose radiation cardiovascular risk. Aim(s): We investigated the effect of long-term medical occupational exposure to low doses of ionizing radiation (LDIR) on MP populations levels. Method(s): The current study was conducted in accordance with the Helsinki Declaration on 38 healthy medical workers occupationally exposed to LDIR and 29 matched controls by gender, age, and smoking habits. The measured MP by flow cytometry were classified as positive or negative phosphatidylserine (PS+ or PS-), and phenotyped according to their cellular origin. Result(s): Total MP (PS-/PS+), regardless of phenotype, were significantly higher in workers occupationally exposed to LDIR than controls (p=0.0004). In medical exposed workers, PS- MP predominated (68%) and were approximately three times more common than PS+ MP. Concerning the measurement of MP according to their cellular origin, we found that MP derived from platelets (CD41a+ PMP), endothelial (CD146+ EMP), leucocytes (CD45+ LMP) and erythrocytes (CD235a+ RMP) are more abundant in exposed workers than those in controls (p< 0.0001). However, no significant difference was found in the proportion of the other blood elements in the peripheral circulation between the two groups. In addition, no association was observed between MP levels and the studied confounding factors. Conclusion(s): Our results suggest that elevated circulating MP populations levels represent an indicator of cellular damage caused by medical exposure to LDIR. By consequence, the quantification of MP seems to a useful biomarker for assessing the negative effects of occupational exposure to ionizing radiation. (Figure Presented) .",Included
1902,"Radiotherapy plus concomitant and adjuvant temozolomide for glioblastoma BACKGROUND: Glioblastoma, the most common primary brain tumor in adults, is usually rapidly fatal. The current standard of care for newly diagnosed glioblastoma is surgical resection to the extent feasible, followed by adjuvant radiotherapy. In this trial we compared radiotherapy alone with radiotherapy plus temozolomide, given concomitantly with and after radiotherapy, in terms of efficacy and safety. METHOD(S): Patients with newly diagnosed, histologically confirmed glioblastoma were randomly assigned to receive radiotherapy alone (fractionated focal irradiation in daily fractions of 2 Gy given 5 days per week for 6 weeks, for a total of 60 Gy) or radiotherapy plus continuous daily temozolomide (75 mg per square meter of body-surface area per day, 7 days per week from the first to the last day of radiotherapy), followed by six cycles of adjuvant temozolomide (150 to 200 mg per square meter for 5 days during each 28-day cycle). The primary end point was overall survival. RESULT(S): A total of 573 patients from 85 centers underwent randomization. The median age was 56 years, and 84 percent of patients had undergone debulking surgery. At a median follow-up of 28 months, the median survival was 14.6 months with radiotherapy plus temozolomide and 12.1 months with radiotherapy alone. The unadjusted hazard ratio for death in the radiotherapy-plus-temozolomide group was 0.63 (95 percent confidence interval, 0.52 to 0.75; P<0.001 by the log-rank test). The two-year survival rate was 26.5 percent with radiotherapy plus temozolomide and 10.4 percent with radiotherapy alone. Concomitant treatment with radiotherapy plus temozolomide resulted in grade 3 or 4 hematologie toxic effects in 7 percent of patients.

2016,"The interdependence between clinical features of rheumatoid arthritis, thyroid gland function, and the anti-hormonal antibodies Background: According to the common notions, rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is an immunopathological condition with complex autoimmune response, directed presumably to synovial tissue. Besides that, there are some organ involvements in RA, that can strongly affect the extent of the autoimmune reactions. One of this organs is thyroid gland, because changes of its function, either increase or decrease, modulate activity of immune cells and inflammation level on the whole. Production of antibodies, directed to T3 and T4, is a candidate mechanism of the thyroid involvement. Objective(s): The objectives of our study are detection of different thyroid conditions in RA including determination of lesion type and function assessment, as well as searching for interdependence between the clinical features of RA, type of thyroid involvement, and the level of the anti-hormonal antibodies. Method(s): The research was carried out in agreement with the principles of the World Medical Association Declaration of Helsinki (1997). Approval for the investigation was got from the Regional Medical Ethics Committee. We enrolled adult patients with RA, verified using ACR/EULAR criteria (2010). RA activity was determined by means of DAS28 index. Thyroid involvement was detected by clinical, ultrasound, and laboratory assessment, including TSH, free T3, free T4, and anti-TPO. Anti-T3 and anti-T4 antibodies were measured using ELISA and calculated in terms of optical density units (ODU). The positive cutoff values, 0.098 ODU for anti-T3 and 0.093 ODU for anti-T4, have been found using healthy controls (n=39). Results were expressed as means+/-standard errors, the differences were considered significant at p<0.05. Result(s): 75 patients with RA have been enrolled, including 61 (81.4%) women and 14 (18.6%) men, their age was from 25 to 78 years. Mean RA activity was 3.2+/-1.4 DAS28 points. Different visceral involvements were detected in 20 (26.7%) cases, and 5 (6.7%) of them had an overt clinical picture of thyroid lesions. The signs and symptoms for 4 of them were similar to Hashimoto's thyroiditis with hyperfunction, the remaining one was complied to the mixed toxic goiter. All these 5 patients had low TSH and quite high DAS28 score (4.8+/-1.9). However, the prevalence of subclinical thyroid disorders in RA was considerably higher. Virtually all the patients (n=73) have been revealed anti-T3 (0.128+/-0.047 ODU) and/or anti-T4 antibodies (0.152+/-0.050 ODU). There was no relationship between these antibodies and organ involvement, other than thyroid gland; RF titers also had no significant influence. We found some rather unexpected dependencies of these markers with X-ray RA stages, as well as with RA activity. There was a clear trend of elevation of mean anti-T4 concentration together with higher Steinbrocker stage (p=0.034, ANOVA), the inverse tendency have been observed for anti-T3 (p=0.047, ANOVA). Correlations of DAS28 score with anti-T4 (r=0.525, p=0.031) and anti-T3 (r=-0.391, p=0.040) were also opposite. There was another significant inverse correlation of DAS28 score and TSH concentration (r=-0.330, p=0.046). Conclusion(s): Our data suggest that though anti-T4 concentration is tended to be elevated, high RA activity can promote hyperthyroidism. This is probably due to either influence of these antibodies to T4 and T3 production, or immune disturbances caused by thyroid hyperfunction itself.",Excluded
3426,"[Low-dose CT in neutropenic patients with fever of unknown origin] PURPOSE: To define the value of low-dose multislice CT in a clinical setting for early detection of pneumonia in neutropenic patients with fever of unknown origin., MATERIALS AND METHODS: Thirty-five neutropenic patients suffering from fever of unknown origin with normal chest X-ray underwent unenhanced low-dose CT of the chest (120 kV, 10 eff. mAs, collimation 4 x 1 mm) using a multislice CT scanner. Axial und frontal slices with a thickness of 5 mm were calculated. If no pneumonia was found, standard antibiotics were given and a repeated examination was performed if fever continued. In case of pneumonia, antimycotic therapy was added and a follow-up CT was performed within one week. Regression or progression of pneumonia at follow-up served as evidence of pneumonia; lowering of fever within 48 h or inconspicuous follow-up CT was regarded as absence of pneumonia., RESULTS: Ten of 35 patients had pneumonic infiltration, which decreased or increased on follow-up CT in 3 and 6 patients, respectively. One patient revealed leucemic infiltration by bronchoalveolar lavage. Twenty-five of 35 patients had no evidence of pneumonia. Twenty of these patients were free of fever within 48 h under antibiotics; one patient died due to his basic illness. Out of 4 patients with persisting fever, 3 patients had no pneumonia on repeated examination; one patient showed disseminated micronodular infiltration. Frontal reconstructions helped to differentiate infiltration from atelectasis in 4 patients. Sensitivity and specificity for the detection of pneumonia at the first examination were 90 % and 96 %, negative predictive value was 96 %., CONCLUSION: Low-dose multislice CT should be performed in neutropenic patients having a fever of unknown origin and normal chest X-ray.",Excluded
3564,"Survival outcomes and patterns of failure after D2 dissection and adjuvant chemoradiotherapy for locally advanced gastric cancer: A retrospective study objective: The goal of the study was to analyze the incidence and patterns of failure in patients with gastric cancer who received D2 dissection and adjuvant chemoradiotherapy (CRT). Method(s): From January 2004 to October 2015, 324 patients with gastric cancer who underwent radical D2 resection followed by postoperative CRT were enrolled. Clinicopathological characteristics and patterns of failure were retrospectively reviewed to identify factors associated with survival and recurrence. Result(s): After a median follow-up of 30 months, the 3-year overall survival and 3-year disease-free survival rates of these patients were 60.3 and 51.1%, respectively. 117 patients had recurrence or metastasis, with peritoneal recurrence as the most frequent (20.7%), followed by distant metastasis (14.2%). The most commonly involved distant organs were the liver (5.9%) and bone (4.9%). Locoregional failure occurred in 39 patients (12.0%), with isolated regional failure occurring in only 23 (7.1%). Further multivariate Cox regression analysis revealed N stage to be an independent risk factor for distant failure-free survival (p = 0.012). Independent risk factors for peritoneal metastasis were tumor differentiation (p = 0.022), T stage (p =0.035) and vascular invasion (p = 0.016). conclusion: Postoperative CRT has a potential effect on optimizing locoregional control, resulting in only 12.0% of locoregional failure. In patients after D2 resection and adjuvant CRT, peritoneal metastasis was the leading pattern of failure, followed by distant metastasis.Copyright © 2018 British Institute of Radiology.

168,"Optimal adjuvant radiotherapy dose for stage I, II or III Merkel cell carcinoma: an analysis of the National Cancer Database BACKGROUND: We performed an analysis of the National Cancer Database to determine optimal doses of conventionally-fractionated adjuvant radiotherapy for patients with stage I/II or III Merkel cell carcinoma., METHODS: The cohort included 2735 patients with resected Merkel cell carcinoma of the head and neck, trunk or extremities receiving radiotherapy. Exclusion criteria included doses of radiotherapy <30 or >80 Gy, or dose per fraction >200 or <180 cGy. Recursive partitioning analysis and spline models were used to select dose thresholds. Multivariable Cox regression was performed to validate thresholds with respect to overall survival., RESULTS: Recursive partitioning analysis models defined a threshold of 57 Gy for stage I/II Merkel cell carcinoma, above which 3-year overall survival rate was decreased (P < 0.0001). The 3-year overall survival rate for patients receiving 50.0-57.0 Gy (81.2%) was greater compared to doses of 30.0-49.9 Gy (75.3%) or >57.0 Gy (70%, P < 0.0001). Doses > 57.0 Gy were associated with an increased hazard of death (1.31, confidence interval 1.07-1.60) with respect to doses of 50.0-57.0 Gy. Doses < 50.0 Gy for stage III Merkel cell carcinoma were associated with worsened 3-year overall survival (P < 0.0001) and increased hazard of death (2.01, confidence interval 1.43-2.82) with respect to doses between 50.0 and 57.0 Gy., CONCLUSIONS: Our results support doses of 50-57 Gy for most patients with stage I/II Merkel cell carcinoma receiving conventionally-fractionated adjuvant radiotherapy. In contrast to a prior National Cancer Database analysis, our results suggest doses >= 50 Gy should be strongly considered for patients with stage III Merkel cell carcinoma regardless of anatomic subsite.

27,"Can both cruciate ligaments be preserved in knee arthroplasty? Eight- to nine-year follow-up of a bicompartmental knee replacement Preservation of native knee anatomy may confer improved patient satisfaction, as suggested by patient satisfaction scores in unicondylar versus total knee replacement. Bicompartmental knee replacement (BKR) implants similarly promote native tissue preservation. We retrospectively reviewed 42 consecutive patients who underwent BKR from 2006 to 2007. Outcome measures were evaluated. At an average follow-up of 103 months (range 87-110), 34/42 (81%) of implants survived. Among the retained implants, the Knee Society Score (KSS) grade was excellent in 26/34 (76.5%), good in 5/34 (14.7%), fair in 3/34 (8.8%), and poor in 0/34 (0%) of cases. Midterm results of BKR demonstrated 81% survival and 76% with excellent KSS grading. Despite a 20% revision rate at the short-term follow-up, the retained implants functioned well at the midterm follow-up.Copyright © 2016 by Begell House, Inc.",Excluded
1689,"Response-driven imaging biomarkers for predicting radiation necrosis of the brain Radiation necrosis is an uncommon but severe adverse effect of brain radiation therapy (RT). Current predictive models based on radiation dose have limited accuracy. We aimed to identify early individual response biomarkers based upon diffusion tensor (DT) imaging and incorporated them into a response model for prediction of radiation necrosis. Twenty-nine patients with glioblastoma received six weeks of intensity modulated RT and concurrent temozolomide. Patients underwent DT-MRI scans before treatment, at three weeks during RT, and one, three, and six months after RT. Cases with radiation necrosis were classified based on generalized equivalent uniform dose (gEUD) of whole brain and DT index early changes in the corpus callosum and its substructures. Significant covariates were used to develop normal tissue complication probability models using binary logistic regression. Seven patients developed radiation necrosis. Percentage changes of radial diffusivity (RD) in the splenium at three weeks during RT and at six months after RT differed significantly between the patients with and without necrosis (p = 0.05 and p = 0.01). Percentage change of RD at three weeks during RT in the 30 Gy dose-volume of the splenium and brain gEUD combined yielded the best-fit logistic regression model. Our findings indicate that early individual response during the course of RT, assessed by radial diffusivity, has the potential to aid the prediction of delayed radiation necrosis, which could provide guidance in dose-escalation trials.",Excluded
855,"Physicochemical properties of calcific deposits isolated from porcine bioprosthetic heart valves removed from patients following 2-13 years function The purpose of this study was to characterize the physicochemical properties of calcific deposits that cause the failure of tissue-derived heart valve bioprostheses. This was done in an effort to understand the mechanism of pathologic biomineralization in the cardiovascular system and potentially prevent deterioration of bioprostheses. Calcific deposits taken from 10 failed bioprosthetic valves that had been implanted in patients for 2-13 years were characterized by chemical analysis, x-ray diffraction, FTIR spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy, polarized light microscopy, and solubility measurements. The combined results identified the biomineral as an apatitic calcium phosphate salt with substantial incorporation of sodium, magnesium and carbonate. The average Ca/PO4 ratio for this young"" pathologic biomineral was approximately 1.3, considerably lower than approximately 1.7 found in mature atherosclerotic plaque biomineral and mature skeletal biomineral, both of which approximate hydroxyapatite in composition. Deproteinated calcific deposits from bioprostheses had thermodynamic solubilities comparable to those of both atherosclerotic plaque, typical pathologic biomineral and hydrolyzed octacalcium phosphate (OCP, Ca4H(PO4)3 x 2.5 H2O), a proposed precursor phase to biomineral apatite. This later finding, together with chemical composition and structural details of the bioprosthetic deposits themselves, supports a mechanism of cardiovascular calcification in which OCP plays a crucial role in the formation of the final apatitic phase. This suggests an approach toward prevention of bioprosthetic tissue calcification through control of the formation of the kinetically favored OCP precursor and/or its transformation into bioapatite.""",Excluded
3147,"Inter-laboratory comparison of cytogenetic endpoints for the biomonitoring of radiological workers Purpose: The evaluation of different cytogenetic endpoints of radiation damage for the biomonitoring of contract workers temporarily employed at nuclear power plants. Material(s) and Method(s): Blood samples from six donors were irradiated in vitro with doses ranging from 0.1 to 2 Gy 60Co gamma-rays. Compared were a conventional analysis for dicentrics, the conventional micronucleus (MN) assay, the centromere micronucleus assay using p82H and an alphaAllCen pancentromeric probe, and tricolour FISH with chromosome 2, 4 and 8 DNA probes for the scoring of translocations. Result(s): Agreement in the number of MN between Giemsa-and propidium iodine fluorescence-stained preparations was obtained. The control samples showed higher centromere positivity for the MN after FISH with the p82H probe compared with the alphaAllCen probe. The MN results with both probes showed a slight but systematic increase in the number of centromere-positive MN with dose, indicating that radiation, although principally clastogenic, also has aneuploidogenic properties. The values of the genomic translocation frequency (F(G)) derived from the observed translocation frequencies were systematically higher than the dicentric yields. Comparing the sensitivity of the different methods with restriction of the scoring time to 1 day for biomonitoring purposes, the centromere micronucleus assay had the lowest dose detection limit (0.1 to 0.2 Gy). Conclusion(s): This study shows that at present only the centromere micronucleus assay can combine high sensitivity with a reasonable scoring time for the biomonitoring of relatively large populations.",Excluded
1929,"Volumetric mapping of bound and pore water as well as collagen protons in cortical bone using 3D ultrashort echo time cones MR imaging techniques Cortical bone assessment using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has recently received great attention in an effort to avoid the potential harm associated with ionizing radiation-based techniques. Ultrashort echo time MRI (UTE-MRI) techniques can acquire signal from major hydrogen proton pools in cortical bone, including bound and pore water, as well as from the collagen matrix. This study aimed to develop and evaluate the feasibility of a technique for mapping bound water, pore water, and collagen proton densities in human cortical bone ex vivo and in vivo using three-dimensional UTE Cones (3D-UTE-Cones) MRI. Eight human tibial cortical bone specimens (63+/-19years old) were scanned using 3D-UTE-Cones sequences on a clinical 3T MRI scanner and a micro-computed tomography (muCT) scanner. Total, bound, and pore water proton densities (TWPD, BWPD, and PWPD, respectively) were measured using UTE and inversion recovery UTE (IR-UTE) imaging techniques. Macromolecular proton density (MMPD), a collagen representation, was measured using TWPD and macromolecular fraction (MMF) obtained from two-pool UTE magnetization transfer (UTE-MT) modeling. The correlations between proton densities and muCT-based measures were investigated. The 3D-UTE-Cones techniques were further applied on ten young healthy (34+/-3years old) and five old (78+/-6years old) female volunteers to evaluate the techniques' feasibility for translational clinical applications. In the ex vivo study, PWPD showed the highest correlations with bone porosity and bone mineral density (BMD) (R=0.79 and -0.70, p<0.01). MMPD demonstrated moderate to strong correlations with bone porosity and BMD (R=-0.67 and 0.65, p<0.01). MMPD showed strong correlation with age in specimens from female donors (R=-0.91, p=0.03, n=5). The presented comprehensive 3D-UTE-Cones imaging protocol allows quantitative mapping of protons in major pools of cortical bone ex vivo and in vivo. PWPD and MMPD can serve as potential novel biomarkers to assess bone matrix and microstructure, as well as bone age- or injury-related variations. Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

Posttreatment tumor response was assessed by cross-sectional imaging using the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) and tumor-marker levels. Laboratory and clinical toxicities and clinical symptoms were monitored., RESULTS: The median activity delivered was 1.63 GBq (range 0.63-2.36). Imaging follow-up using RECIST at 3-month follow-up demonstrated partial response, stable disease, and progressive disease in 22.5, 75.0, and 2.5% of patients, respectively. In 97.5% of patients, the liver lesions appeared hypovascular or partially necrotic. The mean follow-up was 16.2 months with 40 patients (95.2%) remaining alive. The median decrease in tumor-marker levels at 3 months was 54.8% (chromogranin A) and 37.3% (serotonin), respectively. There were no acute or delayed toxicities greater than grade 2 according to Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events [CTCAE (v3.0)]. No radiation-induced liver disease was noted. Improvement of clinical symptoms 3 months after treatment was observed in 36 of 38 symptomatic patients., CONCLUSION: Radioembolization with (90)Y-microspheres is a safe and effective treatment option in patients with otherwise treatment-refractory NETLMs. Antitumoral effect is supported by good local tumor control, decreased tumor-marker levels, and improved clinical symptoms. Further investigation is warranted to define the role of radioembolization in the treatment paradigm for NETLMs.",Excluded

This study aimed to investigate the complications associated with mandibulotomy and analyze factors that could affect the risks of developing these complications. The hospital records of all patients who underwent a mandibulotomy as part of their tumour ablative surgery at two major centres in Malaysia were reviewed retrospectively. Demographic, clinical, and complications data were recorded and analyzed. Early postoperative complications occurred in 46.5% of the patients and post-radiation therapy complications in 16.1%. Wound dehiscence (27.9%) and inferior alveolar nerve injury (25.6%) were the common early postoperative complications. Dental injuries (9.7%) and plate exposure/infection (9.7%) were the common post-radiation therapy complications. Furthermore, inferior alveolar nerve injury and early abscess formation were significantly associated with the site of the mandibulotomy. The T-stage of a tumour but not the site of mandibulotomy was significantly associated with tumour margin clearance. Mandibulotomy does pose an added risk of complications for a patient undergoing tumour surgery. The benefits of mandibulotomy in terms of gaining margin clearance could not be proven in this study.

678,"An open-label, prospective pilot clinical study of denosumab for severe hyperparathyroidism in patients with low bone mass undergoing dialysis CONTEXT: Denosumab is widely used for bone diseases with increased bone resorption. Its effectiveness in patients with severe secondary hyperparathyroidism on dialysis is unclear.
OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of denosumab in patients with severe secondary hyperparathyroidism who are on dialysis.
DESIGN: This 6-month prospective, open-labeled study evaluated 12 patients (five women, seven men; mean age 53.5 ± 3.8 y). All had intact PTH (iPTH; > 1000 pg/mL), low bone mass (T-score < -1.0 SD), and bone pain and were poor surgical candidates. Serum calcium, phosphorus, alkaline phosphatase (AP), and iPTH levels were assessed at baseline and every month thereafter. Vertebral spine x-rays and bone mineral densities (BMDs) (lumbar spine and femoral neck) were assessed at the start and end of the study. All patients received denosumab (60 mg), calcitriol, phosphate binders, and dialysate calcium that were adjusted according to the biochemistry data.
RESULTS: The BMD increased in both the femoral neck (mean increase 23.7% ± 4.0%) and lumbar spine (17.1% ± 2.6%) after 6 months. In the first month, most patients had increased iPTH levels, which dramatically decreased from 1702.1 ± 181.9 to 518.8 ± 126.8 pg/mL by the end of the study after increasing the calcitriol dose. All patients had significant decreases in AP, calcium × phosphorus, and bone pain. Changes in femoral neck BMD correlated only with AP and iPTH levels.
CONCLUSIONS: Denosumab is effective in restoring bone mass and reducing bone pain in patients on dialysis with secondary hyperparathyroidism. It also allows for a more aggressive use of calcitriol to control hyperparathyroidism.",Excluded
120,"Individualizing cancer treatment: biological optimization models in treatment planning and delivery PURPOSE: During the last 30 years radiation therapy has developed from classical rectangular beams via conformation therapy with largely uniform dose delivery, but irregular field shapes, to fully intensity modulated dose delivery where the total dose distribution in the tumor can be fully controlled in three dimensions. This last step has been developed during the last 15-20 years and has opened up the possibilities for truly optimized radiation therapy., METHODS AND MATERIALS: Today it is not only possible to produce almost any desired dose distribution in the tumor volume. It is also possible to deliver the dose distribution, which has the highest probability to cure the patient without inducing severe complications in normal tissues. To fully exploit the advantages of intensity-modulated radiation therapy, quality of life or radiobiologic objectives have to be used, preferably combined with predictive assay of radiation sensitivity., RESULTS: This article will briefly discuss the biologic objective functions and the associated advantages in the treatment outcome using new approaches such as consideration of stochastic variations in sensitivity and optimization of the angle of incidence and fractionation schedule with intensity-modulated beams. Finally, different possibilities for realizing general three-dimensional intensity-modulated dose delivery will be discussed., CONCLUSIONS: Once accurate genetically and/or cell survival based predictive assays become available, radiation therapy will become an exact science allowing truly individual optimization considering also the panorama of side-effects that the patient is willing to accept.",Excluded
2088,"Total mesorectal excision (TME) with or without preoperative radiotherapy in the treatment of primary rectal cancer: Prospective randomised trial with standard operative and histopathological techniques Objective: To document local recurrence in primary rectal cancer when standardised techniques of surgery, radiotherapy, and pathology are used, and to investigate whether the local recurrence rate after total mesorectal excision permits the omission of adjuvant short term preoperative radiotherapy. Design(s): Prospective randomised study. Setting(s): Dutch (n = 80), English (n = 1), German (n = 1), Swedish (n = 9), and Swiss (n = 1) hospitals. Subjects: The first 500 randomised Dutch patients with primary rectal cancer. Main Outcome Measure(s): Local recurrence, survival, operation- related factors, specific pathological tumour characteristics, short and long term morbidity, and quality of life. Result(s): Between January 1996 and April 1998, 871 Dutch and 94 other patients were randomised. Our feasibility analysis shows that cooperation between and within the participating disciplines goes well. With regard to the surgical part, this can be confirmed by the large number of operations attended by consultant surgeons (58%). The number of abdominoperineal resections appeared to be low (30%), as did the percentage of lateral margins involved (13%). The rate of adverse effects of radiotherapy was acceptable. Apart from a larger operative blood loss and a higher infective complication rate in the irradiated group, no significant differences were found with regard to morbidity and mortality between the randomised groups. Conclusion(s): The accrual of our trial is going well and it is feasible; short term preoperative radiotherapy is safe even in combination with TME.",Excluded
3687,"Impact of chemical exposure on cancer mortality in a French cohort of uranium processing workers BACKGROUND: Nuclear workers may be exposed to a variety of chemical hazards, in addition to radiation. We examined the effect of chemical exposures on cancer mortality among French uranium processing workers at the AREVA NC Pierrelatte facility., METHODS: A cohort of 2,897 uranium processing workers employed for at least 6 months was followed from 1968 through 2006. Exposure to uranium and potentially carcinogenic chemicals was assessed with a plant-specific job-exposure matrix. Mortality hazard ratios (HRs) for cancers of the lung, lymphohematopoietic system, kidney and bladder, brain and central nervous system (BCNS), and prostate were estimated for each specific chemical exposure, with Cox regression models stratified for sex and calendar period and adjusted for socioeconomic status. Additional adjustments enabled us to examine the effect of co-exposure to uranium and other chemicals., RESULTS: Exposure to aromatic solvents was associated with increased risk of BCNS malignancies after adjustment for other chemicals (HR=6.53, 95% CI=1.14-37.41; n=6) and for other chemicals and uranium (HR=7.26, 95% CI=0.90-58.19) in the annual exposure status model. Selected groups of lymphohematopoietic cancers were found associated with solvent exposure. Inconclusive results were found regarding chromium (VI) exposure, since only 2 workers died from lung cancer among 109 exposed., CONCLUSION: Based on our pilot study, it seemed important to take into account chemical exposures in the analyses of cancer mortality among French uranium processing workers.

2718,"Evaluation of routine low dose CT chest imaging performed during whole body I-131 imaging post remnant ablation for thyroid cancer Background: Radioactive Iodine (I-131) forms part of conventional treatment for thyroid cancer after thyroid surgery. The lungs are one of the common site for metastatic disease for thyroid malignancy, which can have a very protracted course. Often at subsequent follow-up, incidental lung nodules are identified. The significance of these are often unclear, due to the lack of baseline imaging. The Introduction of SPECT/CT cameras, has allowed the acquisition of low dose CT Chest (ldCT) during normal nuclear medicine studies, with minimal additional discomfort or inconvenience to the patient. Our department added routine SPECT/CT of the neck and chest, with formal reconstructions of the CT chest, as standard practice during whole body imaging post I-131 ablative therapy. We aim to review the usefulness and radiation burden of this practice at our institution. Method(s): We respectively reviewed the imaging I-131imaging and dose records of all the patients who underwent radioactive ablation treatment for thyroid malignancy from Aug 2011 to Dec 2015. We also reviewed the reconstructed CT chest imaging and dose records performed as part of the SPECT/CT to determine its usefulness. Result(s): 256 patients underwent I-131 ablation at our institution. 196 patients who present for initial ablation had ldCT that encompassed the majority of the chest, and 26 with findings. Average therapy dose in initial I-131 therapy was 104mCi. On the assumption of no residual thyroid present, the estimated dose was 160mSv. The additional radiation exposure from the ldCT Chest is estimated at 1.08mSv. Conclusion(s): Based on our calculations routine ldCT chest performed as part of SPECT/CT post I-131 ablation has resulted in increased dose of approximately 1.1mSv (at worse about 1%). This minimal additional dose, provides baseline for follow-up at the expense of incidental findings. Longer term follow-up, will be required to determine to usefulness of these additional ldCT studies.",Excluded
2967,"Comparison of 3D confromal radiotherapy and intensity modulated radiotherapy with or without simultaneous integrated boost during concurrent chemoradiation for locally advanced head and neck cancers Objective: Radiotherapy techniques have evolved from 3D conformal radiotherapy (3D-CRT) to intensity modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) where boost fields are delivered either sequentially (IMRTseq) or with a simultaneous integrated boost (IMRT+SIB). Our goal was to compare the outcomes of patients treated with IMRT+SIB to traditional standards. Method(s): We analyzed the efficacy and toxicity of patients treated with concurrent chemoradiation using 3D-CRT, IMRTseq or IMRT+SIB. Between 1993 and 2012, 379 patients with non-metastatic Stage III-IV head and neck squamous cell cancer were treated with concurrent chemoradiation using 3D-CRT (n = 125), IMRTseq (n = 120) and IMRT+SIB (n = 134). Result(s): Patients treated with any technique had similar rates of 2y local control, 2y regional control, 2y progression free survival and 2y overall survival. Patients treated with IMRT +SIB had lower rates acute toxicity according to Grade 3 or greater mucositis (3D-CRT: 44.0% vs. IMRTseq: 36.7% vs. IMRT+SIB: 22.4%; P<.0001), dermatitis (3D-CRT: 44.0% vs. IMRTseq: 20.0% vs. IMRT+SIB: 7.5%; P<.0001) and feeding tube placement during radiotherapy (3D-CRT: 80.0% vs. IMRTseq: 50.8% vs. IMRT+SIB: 44.0%; P<.0001) as well as late toxicity as measured by feeding tube use (P<.0001) and tracheostomy use (P<.0001). On multivariate analysis, IMRT+SIB predicted for less mucositis, dermatitis and feeding tube use compared to 3D-CRT and for less dermatitis compared to IMRTseq. Conclusion(s): Compared to 3D-CRT and IMRTseq, IMRT+SIB provided similar outcomes and potentially less toxicity indicating it is a feasible technique for chemoradiation in locally advanced head and neck cancer. © 2014 Spiotto, Weichselbaum.",Excluded

Design(s): Cohort study. Setting(s): Population based. Participant(s): 3585 people aged >=55 years were selected from the Rotterdam Study, on the basis of the availability of radiographs of baseline and follow-up. Main Outcome Measure(s): Incidence of knee or hip osteoarthritis was defined as minimally grade 2 at follow-up and grade 0 or 1 at baseline. The progression of osteoarthritis was defined as a decrease in joint space width. Method(s): x Rays of the knee and hip at baseline and follow-up (mean follow-up of 6.6 years) were evaluated. BMI was measured at baseline. Result(s): A high BMI (>27 kg/m2) at baseline was associated with incident knee osteoarthritis (odds ratio (OR) 3.3), but not with incident hip osteoarthritis. A high BMI was also associated with progression of knee osteoarthritis (OR 3.2). For the hip, a significant association between progression of osteoarthritis and BMI was not found. Conclusion(s): On the basis of these results, we conclude that BMI is associated with the incidence and progression of knee osteoarthritis. Furthermore, it seems that BMI is not associated with the incidence and progression of hip osteoarthritis.",Excluded

840,"Concomitant radiochemotherapy for locally advanced oro- and hypopharyngeal cancer: tolerance and early results Combination of radio- and chemotherapy is one of the methods which may improve results of treatment in patients with locally advanced head and neck cancer. Currently, the most promising sequence of radio- and chemotherapy is concomitant. In Head and Neck Cancer Department of Cancer Center in Warsaw since 1995 is continued study estimated tolerance and effectiveness of the concomitant radiochemotherapy for patients with locally advanced oro- and hypopharyngeal cancer. Chemotherapy consist of cisplatinum and 5-fluorouracil in continuous infusion during first week of irradiation followed by 24-hours infusion of 5-fluorouracil one weekly until radiotherapy is finished. Radiotherapy is used with conventional fractionation 2 Gy per fraction, 5 fractions weekly to total dose 66 Gy. Between October 1995 and September 1998 fifty seven patients with oropharyngeal cancer were entered to study. Tolerance of treatment was acceptable. Complete regression of the tumor was obtained in 41/57 patients (72%). Five other patients after radiotherapy were referred for successful radical neck dissection. Including this group, local control was obtained in 81%. At this moment, 60% of patients are alive without evidence of disease. In 12 patients with hypopharyngeal cancer tolerance of treatment and early results were poor, so the study was stopped in this group.",Excluded

Commercial analytical reporting tools that use NHS administrative data can generate local reports from HES and may serve as a starting point for clinical audit. Aim To determine the prevalence, demographics, aetiology and outcomes of emergency readmissions following elective endoscopy. Methods From 1.4.08 to 31.3.09 emergency admissions within 6 days of a day-case upper or lower GI endoscopy (ERCP excluded) were identified from analyses of NHS administrative data at RLUH, AUH, SRH, and SMUH. Using a standard proforma, each readmission was audited using case notes, endoscopy database, and the hospital informatics systems. Two senior doctors determined the validity of the admission subdividing them into; unrelated, possible and definite with the latter two categories defining an endoscopy readmission. Results Of the 29 868 daycases, 235 admissions were identified, of which 147 were endoscopy readmissions. The following data all relates to endoscopy readmissions. Demographics Male: Female ratio=1:1; Mean age (SD): 65.1 years (17).Readmission rate overall was 0.49%(0.56% for upper and 0.42% for lower GI procedures) with highest rates for therapeutic uppers (1.75%) > therapeutic lowers (0.56%) > diagnostic upper (0.47%) > diagnostic lower (0.38%). Aetiology The most common reasons for admission were vascular events (26.5%) > Symptoms such as pain (17%), GI haemorrhage (17%), suspected/confirmed perforation (17% (confirmed 6.1%))> respiratory (10.2%) causes >bowel obstruction (4.8%): Investigations 71% required simple blood tests and/or x-rays and 26%, cross-sectional imaging. Treatment 84.4% required only observation, 4.8%; surgery, 2.7%; repeat endoscopy, and 7.5% IV antibiotics. Outcomes 24.5% were short-stays discharges from either AED, or medical/Surgical assessment units. Mean LOS was 8.2 (13) days and 30-day mortality was 6.8%. Conclusion Commercial analytical reporting tools combined with local interpretation and multicentre collaboration was essential for determining useful information regarding endoscopy readmissions. Readmission rates predictably varied with the procedure type (0.38-1.75%) with therapeutic procedures having the highest. While most patients required simple observation/supportive care, LOS was considerable and mortality rate among readmitted cases was significant.",Excluded

984,"Prognostic factors and prevention of radioembolization-induced liver disease UNLABELLED: Radioembolization (RE)-induced liver disease (REILD) has been defined as jaundice and ascites appearing 1 to 2 months after RE in the absence of tumor progression or bile duct occlusion. Our aims were to study the incidence of REILD in a large cohort of patients and the impact of a series of changes introduced in the processes of treatment design, activity calculation, and the routine use of ursodeoxycholic acid and low-dose steroids (modified protocol). Between 2003 and 2011, 260 patients with liver tumors treated by RE were studied (standard protocol: 75, modified protocol: 185). REILD appeared only in patients with cirrhosis or in noncirrhosis patients exposed to systemic chemotherapy prior to RE. Globally, the incidence of REILD was reduced in the modified protocol group from 22.7% to 5.4% and the incidence of severe REILD from 13.3% to 2.2% (P<0.0001). Treatment efficacy was not jeopardized since 3-month disease control rates were virtually identical in both groups (66.7% and 67.2%, P=0.93). Exposure to chemotherapy in the 2-month period following RE and being treated by the standard protocol were independent predictors of REILD among noncirrhosis patients. In cirrhosis, the presence of a small liver (total volume<1.5 L), an abnormal bilirubin (>1.2 mg/dL), and treatment in a selective fashion were independently associated with REILD., CONCLUSION: REILD is an uncommon but relevant complication that appears when liver tissue primed by cirrhosis or prior and subsequent chemotherapy is exposed to the radiation delivered by radioactive microspheres. We designed a comprehensive treatment protocol that reduces the frequency and the severity of REILD. Copyright © 2012 American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases.",Excluded

Method(s): Seventy-eight lesions of brain metastases in 49 lung cancer patients treated by stereotactic radiotherapy between September 2003 and December 2006 were analyzed. In the treatment planning, the planning target volume (PTV) was defined as an enhanced lesion plus 3 mm margin. A total dose of 39-42 Gy in three fractions was delivered to the isocenters of the PTV. Result(s): The median survival time after stereotactic radiotherapy was 17.4 months. The 1- and 2-year survival rates were 61% and 32%, respectively. The presence of extracranial tumors, the pre-treatment performance status, and the Radiation Therapy Oncology Group recursive partitioning analysis class were significant prognostic factors. The 1-and 2-year local recurrence rates were 14% and 17%, respectively, with no serious acute toxic effect. Injuries involving brain necrosis were observed in six patients. New brain metastases or meningeal carcinomatosis was seen in more than half of the patients following treatment with stereotactic radiotherapy.

This report includes a description of the automated preparation of 15O-butanol which allows repetitive activation studies, each 15 min apart. Dynamic rCBF studies were extended by prolonged measurements up to 15 min after injection over different organs such as brain, liver, kidneys and bladder. All measurements were done with a whole-body PET camera PC4096-15WB. Based on the pharmacokinetic data in 13 subjects the radiation doses to single organs were calculated according to MIRD pamphlet No. 11 and the effective dose defined by ICRP 60 as an indicator of radiation dose to the total body. The liver received the highest radiation dose of about 2.2 mGy per 1500 MBq of injected 15O-butanol, which is the typical amount of administered tracer in one rCBF measurement. The dose to the kidneys was 1.6 mGy, to the stomach 0.8 mGy, and to the brain 0.16 mGy.

3024,"Seven cases of radiation-induced cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma We report 7 cases of radiation-induced skin cancer. The diagnosis was based on the history of radiotherapy for benign skin diseases (5 cases) and of occupational exposures to medical doctors (2 cases). All cases were squamous cell carcinomas which arose from chronic radiodermatitis. The estimated latent period of these tumors ranged from 6 to 64 years, with an average of 29.9 years. After surgical treatments of the lesions, no local recurrences were observed in all cases. Benign skin diseases had sometimes been treated with low-energy radiation before the 1960s. Considering the estimated latent period, the peak time point of developing risk of radiation-induced skin cancer by such treatment has been already passed, however, the danger of it should not be ignored in future. In association with multiplicity of radiation usage, occupational exposure of radiation may develop the risk of occurrence of skin cancer in future. Therefore, we should recognize that radiation-induced skin cancer is not in the past. In the cases of chronic skin diseases showing warty keratotic growth, erosion and ulcer, we should include chronic radio-dermatitis in the differential diagnosis. It is necessary to recall all patients about the history of radiotherapy or radiation exposure.

1611,"Diagnostic accuracy of 1.5-t unenhanced whole-heart coronary MR Angiography Performed with 32-Channel Cardiac Coils: Initial single-center experience Purpose: To compare the imaging time and image quality obtained with whole-heart coronary magnetic resonance (MR) angiography performed with fi ve- and 32-channel coils in healthy subjects and determine the accuracy of MR angiography performed with 32-channel coils in the detection of obstructive coronary artery disease (CAD). Materials andMethods: The institutional review board approved the study protocol, and all participants provided written informed consent. The authors studied 10 healthy subjects and 67 patients suspected of having CAD who were scheduled for coronary angiography. Unenhanced 1.5-T coronary MR angiography was performed with fi ve- and 32-channel coils in healthy subjects and with 32-channel coils in patients. Clinicallysignifi cant CAD was defi ned as a diameter reduction of at least 50% at coronary angiography. The sensitivity and specifi city of coronary MR angiography were calculated. Result(s): The mean imaging time was substantially reduced from 2.3 minutes 6 4.2 (standard deviation) with fi ve-channel coils to 6.3 minutes 6 2.2 with 32-channel coils, with equivalent image quality scores. Acquisition of MR angiograms was completed in all 67 patients, with a mean imaging time of 6.2 minutes 6 2.8. The prevalence of CAD in he study population was 58% (39 of the 67 patients). The areas under the receiver operating characteristic curves determined at vessel- and patient-based analyses were 0.91 and 0.90, respectively; the sensitivity and specifi city at vessel-based analysis were 86% and 93%, respectively. Conclusion(s): Whole-heart coronary MR angiography performed at 1.5 T with 32-channel coils permits noninvasive detection of CAD with substantially reduced imaging time. This noninvasive approach can be an alternative to multidetector computed tomographic coronary angiography for ruling out obstructive CAD in patients who have a contraindication to contrast material and in young subjects who are at higher risk from ionizing radiation. © RSNA, 2011.",Excluded
3432,"The role of dose escalation with intracavitary brachytherapy in the treatment of localized CNS malignancies: Outcomes and toxicities of a prospective study Purpose: This single-institution prospective study was designed to investigate the feasibility and safety of dose escalation with GliaSite (Proxima Therapeutics Inc., Alpharetta, GA) brachytherapy for the treatment of patients with newly diagnosed and recurrent central nervous system (CNS) tumors after neurosurgical resection. We now report mature results of this trial, its outcomes, and a toxicity profile. Methods and Materials: Ten adult consecutive patients with recurrent and newly diagnosed CNS malignancies underwent GliaSite brachytherapy after maximally safe neurosurgical resection between 2004 and 2007. GliaSite balloon was placed intraoperatively, and the size was selected so as to conform to the surgical cavity. Low-dose-rate radiation was delivered with an aqueous solution of organically bound 125I (Iotrex: sodium 3-(125I)-iodo-4-hydroxybenzenesulfonate; Proxima Therapeutics Inc.), introduced into the balloon portion of the device via a subcutaneous port. Two to 3 weeks later, the device was filled with Iotrex for a median dwell time of 94.3 hours (range, 68.0-120.5 hours), after which the balloon was explanted. A commercial 3-D planning system was used for a detailed analysis of dosimetry. Median dose of 52.0 Gy (range, 45.0-60.0 Gy) was prescribed 0.5-1.0 cm from the balloon surface. Radiation Therapy Oncology Group (RTOG) criteria were used to assess acute and long-term toxicities associated with this technique. Followup was assessed with MRI scans and was available on all enrolled patients. Result(s): Median followup for surviving patients was 38 months (range, 18-57 months). Mean size of GliaSite balloon was 3.4 cm (range, 2.0-4.0 cm). Mean volume of filling was 19.0 cc (range, 4.0-35.0 cc). Median activity of Iotrex was 301.6 mCi (range, 95.0-515.4 mCi). Median survival was 14.0 months for the entire cohort after the treatment with the GliaSite device. Of our cohort, 6/10 (60%) patients sustained recurrence (20% local and 40% distant). Median time to recurrence after treatment with GliaSite was 8.0 months, and median time to death after recurrence was 7.5 months. There were no RTOG Grade 3 or 4 acute or late toxicities. Followup MRI imaging did not identify any evidence of radiation necrosis. Conclusion(s): Our data indicate that treatment with GliaSite balloon brachytherapy is feasible and safe, while rendering acceptable local control and minimal acute and long-term toxicities for newly diagnosed and recurrent CNS malignancies.

1746,"How far can the radiation dose be lowered in head CT with iterative reconstruction? Analysis of imaging quality and diagnostic accuracy Objective: To evaluate the imaging quality of head CT at lowered radiation dose by combining filtered back projection (FBP) and iterative reconstruction (IR) algorithms. Method(s): Experimental group A (n = 66) underwent CT with 43 % tube current reduction, and group B (n = 58) received an equivalent reduced dose by lowering the tube voltage. An age- and sex-matched control group (n = 72) receiving the conventional radiation dose was retrospectively collected. Imaging for the control group was reconstructed by FBP only, while images for groups A and B were reconstructed by FBP and IR. The signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs), contrast-to-noise ratios (CNRs), sharpness, number of infarcts and severity of subcortical arteriosclerotic encephalopathy (SAE) were compared to assess imaging quality and diagnostic accuracy. Result(s): There were no significant differences in SNRs and CNRs between group A and the control group. There were significantly decreased SNRs and increased CNRs in group B. Image sharpness decreased in both groups. Correlations between detected infarcts and severity of SAE across FBP and IR were high (r = 0.73-0.93). Head diameter was the only significant factor inversely correlated with infratentorial imaging quality. Conclusion(s): Head CT with 43 % reduced tube current reconstructed by IR provides diagnostic imaging quality for outpatient management. Key Points: * Cranial CT using iterative reconstruction provides diagnostic images with 43 % mAs reduction. * Blurring of infratentorial images becomes evident using low-radiation head CT. * Head diameter was inversely correlated with imaging quality in the infratentorium. * Lowering tube kilovoltage requires a higher radiation dose to maintain image quality. © 2013 European Society of Radiology.",Excluded

Using optical coherence tomography (OCT), we compared the morphologic characteristics of ISR between first and second generation DES. Methods and Results: OCT was performed in 66 DES-ISR, defined as >. 50% angiographic diameter stenosis within the stented segment. Patients with ISR of first generation sirolimus-eluting stents (SES), paclitaxel eluting stents (PES) and second generation zotarolimus-eluting stents (ZES), everolimus-eluting stents (EES) and biolimus-eluting stents (BES) were enrolled. Quantitative and qualitative ISR tissue analysis was performed at 1-mm intervals along the entire stent, and categorised as homogeneous, heterogeneous and neo-atherosclerosis. The presence of microvessels and peri-strut low intensity area (PSLIA) was determined in all ISR. Neoatherosclerosis was identified by lipid, calcium and thin-cap fibro-atheroma (TCFA) like lesions. We compared the two DES generations at both early (<. 1. year) and late (>. 1. year) follow-ups.In second generation DES a heterogeneous pattern was prevalent both before and after 1. year (57.1% and 58.6% respectively). Neo-atherosclerosis was more common in the early period in first generation DES (19.4% vs 11.7%, p. <. 0.01), but after one year was more prevalent in second generation DES (7.0% vs 19.3%, p. <. 0.01). Similar prevalence of TCFAs was observed in both groups in all comparisons. Conclusion(s): When ISR restenosis occurs in second generation DES, the current data suggest a different time course and different morphological characteristics from first generation.

In this retrospective study, 6 patients during the period from 2003 to 2010 who were diagnosed with movement disorder-induced cervical spondylosis by neurologists. Each patient received botulinum toxin injection with a total dosage of 500-600U in the sternocleidomastoid, trapezius, splenius capitis, levator scapulae one week prior to surgery. Patients' demographics, diagnoses, injected dosage of botulinum toxin, and operative methods are retrospectively collected. All patients had a repeat cervical spine X-ray to assess the fusion and integrity of the construct. The clinical outcomes were assessed by using modified Rankin scale (mRS). The duration of follow-up was measured from the date of operation to the date of the last clinic visit. The mean age of our patients was 47.2 years ranging from 31 to 64 years.

1590,"Hypothesis testing, statistical power, and confidence limits in the presence of epistemic uncertainty Hypothesis testing, statistical power, and confidence limits are concepts from classical statistics that require data from observations. In some important recent applications some of the data are not observational but are reconstructed by computer models. There is generally epistemic uncertainty in model formulations, as well as in parameter and input values. The resulting epistemic uncertainty of the reconstructed data is determined by an uncertainty analysis and is expressed by subjective probability distributions. Sometimes only the mean or median values of the distributions are used in the concepts mentioned above, which hides the uncertainty of the data thereby rendering misleading results. Misleading results are also obtained if the epistemic uncertainty of the data is combined incorrectly with the stochastic variability of the outcome of the actual random complex concerned. This paper argues that an uncertainty analysis of the application of classical statistical concepts is essentially the correct way of dealing with the epistemic uncertainty of the data.

939,"Construction of a radiation hybrid panel and the first yellowtail (Seriola quinqueradiata) radiation hybrid map using a nanofluidic dynamic array BACKGROUND: Yellowtail (Seriola quinqueradiata) are an economically important species in Japan. However, there are currently no methods for captive breeding and early rearing for yellowtail. Thus, the commercial cultivation of this species is reliant upon the capture of wild immature fish. Given this, there is a need to develop captive breeding techniques to reduce pressure on wild stocks and facilitate the sustainable development of yellowtail aquaculture. We constructed a whole genome radiation hybrid (RH) panel for yellowtail gene mapping and developed a framework physical map using a nanofluidic dynamic array to use SNPs (single nucleotide polymorphisms) in ESTs (expressed sequence tags) for the DNA-assisted breeding of yellowtail., RESULTS: Clonal RH cell lines were obtained after ionizing radiation; specifically, 78, 64, 129, 55, 42, and 53 clones were isolated after treatment with 3,000, 4,000, 5,000, 6,000, 8,000, or 10,000 rads, respectively. A total of 421 hybrid cell lines were obtained by fusion with mouse B78 cells. Ninety-four microsatellite markers used in the genetic linkage map were genotyped using the 421 hybrid cell lines. Based upon marker retention and genome coverage, we selected 93 hybrid cell lines to form an RH panel. Importantly, we performed the first genotyping of yellowtail markers in an RH panel using a nanofluidic dynamic array (Fluidigm, CA, USA). Then, 580 markers containing ESTs and SNPs were mapped in the first yellowtail RH map., CONCLUSIONS: We successfully developed a yellowtail RH panel to facilitate the localization of markers. Using this, a framework RH map was constructed with 580 markers. This high-density physical map will serve as a useful tool for the identification of genes related to important breeding traits using genetic structural information, such as conserved synteny. Moreover, in a comparison of 30 sequences in the RH group 1 (SQ1), yellowtail appeared to be evolutionarily closer to medaka and the green-spotted pufferfish than to zebrafish. We suggest that synteny analysis may be potentially useful as a tool to investigate chromosomal evolution by comparison with model fish.",Excluded
2766,"Angiographic and clinical outcomes at 8 months of cutting balloon angioplasty and beta-brachytherapy for native vessel in-stent restenosis (BETACUT): results from a stopped randomized controlled trial The objective of this study was to assess angiographic and clinical outcomes of cutting balloon (CB) angioplasty and concomitant Sr/Y-90 beta-brachytherapy as a treatment modality for patients with native vessel in-stent restenosis (ISR). Procedural advantages over the standard balloon (SB) have been claimed for the CB. Intracoronary brachytherapy preceded by SB angioplasty is regarded as the treatment of choice in patients with ISR. In an interim analysis of a prospective randomized trial designed for 652 patients, 100 consecutive patients with ISR were assigned to treatment with SB angioplasty (n = 51) or CB angioplasty (n = 49), followed in either case by Sr/Y-90 beta-brachytherapy. Quantitative coronary angiography at baseline, postintervention, and at 8 months was performed by an independent central laboratory. More than 90% of target lesions in the overall patient population were diffuse, with 14% of stents totally occluded. Procedural parameters and immediate angiographic outcomes were essentially the same in either study arm. At 8 months, no statistically significant differences were observed in recurrent angiographic restenosis (SB = 26.1%; CB = 29.5%; P = 0.82), target lesion revascularizations (SB = 13.7%; CB = 8.2%; P = 0.53), and major adverse cardiac events (SB = 15.7%; CB = 8.2%; P = 0.36). In this interim analysis, there was no indication of a beneficial effect of CB use over SB use in terms of angiographic or clinical outcomes at 8-month follow-up. CB angioplasty appears to be as safe and efficacious as SB angioplasty in beta-radiation treatment of patients with predominantly diffuse native vessel ISR. It was decided to discontinue the trial.

To investigate whether it is possible to obtain adequate images at uniform image noise levels and reduced radiation exposure with our automatic tube current modulation (ATCM) technique for 64-detector CT. The study population consisted of 64 patients with known or suspected lung or abdominal disease. We used a 64-detector CT scanner (LightSpeed VCT, GE Healthcare, Waukesha, WI, USA) and a combined angular and longitudinal tube current modulation technique (Smart mA, GE Healthcare, Waukesha, WI, USA) to examine 34 patients. The scanning parameters were identical; the minimum and maximum tube current thresholds were 50 and 800 mA, respectively. For study of the constant tube current technique, 30 additional patients were examined at 350 mA. The CT number and image noise (SD of the CT number) were measured in the 64 patients at six levels, i.e., the center of the left ventricle, the liver dome, the porta hepatis, the center of the spleen and the right and left renal pelvis.

1428,"Radiation pneumonitis: correlation of toxicity with pulmonary metabolic radiation response PURPOSE: To characterize the relationship between radiation pneumonitis (RP) clinical symptoms and pulmonary metabolic activity on post-treatment [(18)F]-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET)., PATIENTS AND METHODS: We retrospectively studied 101 esophageal cancer patients who underwent restaging FDG-PET/computed tomography imaging 3-12 weeks after completing thoracic radiotherapy. The National Institutes of Health Common Toxicity Criteria, version 3, was used to score the RP clinical symptoms. Linear regression was applied to the FDG-PET/computed tomography images to determine the normalized FDG uptake vs. radiation dose. The pulmonary metabolic radiation response (PMRR) was quantified as this slope. Modeling was performed to determine the interaction of PMRR, mean lung dose (MLD), and the percentage of lung receiving >20 Gy with RP outcomes., RESULTS: Of the 101 patients, 25 had Grade 0, 10 had Grade 1, 60 had Grade 2, 5 had Grade 3, and 1 had Grade 5 RP symptoms. Logistic regression analysis demonstrated that increased values of both MLD and PMRR were associated with a greater probability of RP clinical symptoms (p = 0.032 and p = 0.033, respectively). Spearman's rank correlation found no association between the PMRR and the dosimetric parameters (planning target volume, MLD, percentage of lung receiving >5-30 Gy). Twofold cross-validation demonstrated that the combination of MLD and PMRR was superior to either alone for assessing the development of clinical RP symptoms. The combined MLD (or percentage of lung receiving >20 Gy) and PMRR had a greater sensitivity and accuracy (53.3% and 62.5%, respectively) than either alone., CONCLUSION: The results of this study have demonstrated a significant correlation between RP clinical symptoms and the PMRR measured by FDG-PET/computed tomography after thoracic radiotherapy.",Excluded
2493,"A prospective, matched comparison of ultra-low and standard-dose computed tomography for assessment of renal colic OBJECTIVE: To determine the diagnostic accuracy of ultra-low-dose computed tomography (ULDCT) compared with standard-dose CT (SDCT) in the evaluation of patients with clinically suspected renal colic, in addition to secondary features (hydroureteronephrosis, perinephric stranding) and additional pathological entities (renal masses)., PATIENTS AND METHODS: A prospective, comparative cohort study was conducted amongst patients presenting to the emergency department with signs and symptoms suggestive of renal or ureteric colic. Patients underwent both SDCT and ULDCT. Single-blinded review of the image sets was performed independently by three board-certified radiologists., RESULTS: Among 21 patients, the effective radiation dose was lower for ULDCT [mean (SD) 1.02 (0.16) mSv] than SDCT [mean (SD) 4.97 (2.02) mSv]. Renal and/or ureteric calculi were detected in 57.1% (12/21) of patients. There were no significant differences in calculus detection and size estimation between ULDCT and SDCT. A higher concordance was observed for ureteric calculi (75%) than renal calculi (38%), mostly due to greater detection of calculi of <3 mm by SDCT. Clinically significant calculi (>=3 mm) were detected by ULDCT with high specificity (97.6%) and sensitivity (100%) compared to overall detection (specificity 91.2%, sensitivity 58.8%). ULDCT and SDCT were highly concordant for detection of secondary features, while ULDCT detected less renal cysts of <2 cm. Inter-observer agreement for the ureteric calculi detection was 93.9% for SDCT and 87.8% for ULDCT., CONCLUSION: ULDCT performed similarly to SDCT for calculus detection and size estimation with reduced radiation exposure. Based on this and other studies, ULDCT should be considered as the first-line modality for evaluation of renal colic in routine practice.

2223,"Optimization of 64-MDCT urography: Effect of dual-phase imaging with furosemide on collecting system opacification and radiation dose OBJECTIVE. The purpose of this study was to compare opacification of the urinary collecting system and radiation dose associated with three-phase 64-MDCT urographic protocols and those associated with a split-bolus dual-phase protocol including furosemide. MATERIALS AND METHODS. Images from 150 CT urographic examinations performed with three scanning protocols were retrospectively evaluated. Group A consisted of 50 sequentially registered patients who underwent a three-phase protocol with saline infusion. Group B consisted of 50 sequentially registered patients who underwent a reduced-radiation three-phase protocol with saline. Group C consisted of 50 sequentially registered patients who underwent a dual-phase split-bolus protocol that included a low-dose furosemide injection. Opacification of the urinary collecting system was evaluated with segmental binary scoring. Contrast artifacts were evaluated, and radiation doses were recorded. Results were compared by analysis of variance. RESULTS. A significant reduction in mean effective radiation dose was found between groups A and B (p < 0.001) and between groups B and C (p < 0.001), resulting in 65% reduction between groups A and C (p < 0.001). This reduction did not significantly affect opacification score in any of the 12 urinary segments (p = 0.079). In addition, dense contrast artifacts overlying the renal parenchyma observed with the three-phase protocols (groups A and B) were avoided with the dual-phase protocol (group C) (p < 0.001). CONCLUSION. A dual-phase protocol with furosemide injection is the preferable technique for CT urography. In comparison with commonly used three-phase protocols, the dualphase protocol significantly reduces radiation exposure dose without reduction in image quality. © American Roentgen Ray Society.",Excluded
912,"Radiotherapy for nodal recurrence after chemoradiotherapy for esophageal carcinoma Background. To evaluate the treatment outcome of radiotherapy for nodal recurrence after definitive chemoradiotherapy for esophageal carcinoma. Methods. Between 1996 and 2001, ten patients with isolated nodal recurrence after definitive chemoradiotherapy received radiotherapy with or without chemotherapy. The site of recurrence was the mediastinum in five patients, the celiac node in four patients, and the supraclavicular fossa in one patient. All sites of nodal recurrence were outside the previous irradiated area and without local recurrence or distant metastases. Radiotherapy was given with three-dimensional conformal technique, and an average total dose was 60 Gy. Eight patients received chemotherapy concurrently with radiotherapy. Chemotherapy consisted of two cycles of cisplatin and 5-FU. Results. The control rate of the irradiated region was eight of ten patients. The size of all controlled lesions was 3 cm or less in diameter. In five patients, distant metastases developed to other organs and caused death. Two patients survived without disease for 5 years and three patients survived 2 years or more. In four patients with an interval of 2 years or longer between the previous treatment and nodal recurrence, three patients survived without disease. Improvement of clinical symptoms such as dysphagia or hoarseness was obtained in five of six patients. Conclusions. Radiotherapy for isolated nodal recurrence of esophageal carcinoma after definitive chemoradiotherapy is suggested to be safe and effective.

1374,"Increases in central retinal artery blood flow in humans following carotid artery and stellate ganglion irradiation with 0.6 to 1.6 mum irradiation The authors applied near-infrared low-level laser irradiation (LLLI) directed to the stellate ganglion (SG) and to the common carotid artery (CCA), and compared the effects on central retinal artery blood flow using color pulse Doppler sonography. In 10 healthy volunteers, LLLI (0.92 W, 1 : 1 duty cycle, 10 min) to both the SG and CCA significantly increased peak systolic blood velocity in the ophthalmic artery (p<0.001, each) and central retinal artery (p<0.001, each) without changes in vessel resistance. Irradiation to the CCA produced a stronger effect than that to the SG in the ophthalmic artery (p=0.007) and central retinal artery (p=0.031). These data suggest that LLLI to the SG or to the CCA is a useful therapy for increasing the retrobulbar blood flow, with irradiation directed to the CCA being more effective than that directed to the SG in clinical settings.",Excluded

INTRODUCTION: For the induction therapy of non-small-cell lung cancer, we need to look for a regimen which produces a reliable high response rate with a low treatment related morbidity and mortality., METHODS: Patients in clinical stages IB, IIA and B, IIIA and B received a course of therapy with 20Gy of radiation in 2 weeks. This was followed by two courses of chemotherapy consisting of paclitaxel 180mg/m(2), cisplatin 45mg/m(2), and ifosfamide 1000mg/m(2). Two to 3 weeks after chemotherapy, the patients were re-evaluated and, if suitable, underwent surgical therapy., RESULTS: A total of 35 patients were entered into the study. The overall response rate was 82.86% (95% confidence interval, 66.35-94.5%). Complete response (CR) was 20% (95% confidence interval, 8.44-36.94%). Twenty-five patients had surgical resection. Subsequently 18 patients received completion radiotherapy of additional 45Gy. The median follow up is 30 months. In 12 patients with stages IB, IIA and B, the median survival was 61 months, and 5-year survival was 55%. In 23 patients with stages IIIA and B, the median survival was 26 months, and 5-year survival was 9.5%. There was 1 patient with Grade 4 and 13 patients with Grade 3 leukopenia, and half of them received granulocyte colony stimulating factor. By the completion radiotherapy, 6 out of 18 patients had less than Grade 2 esophagitis. Five patients had Grade 2 radiation pneumonitis and one Grade 5 (one mortality). There was no postoperative death. The survival results were comparable to those reported recently by others, however the regimen produced a high response rate with low treatment related morbidity/mortality., CONCLUSION: It is a suitable regimen for induction therapy to include earlier stage resectable non-small-cell lung cancers.",Excluded
216,"Astronaut Cardiovascular Health and Risk Modification (Astro-CHARM) Coronary Calcium Atherosclerotic Cardiovascular Disease Risk Calculator BACKGROUND: Coronary artery calcium (CAC) is a powerful novel risk indicator for atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD). Currently, there is no available ASCVD risk prediction tool that integrates traditional risk factors and CAC., METHODS: To develop a CAC ASCVD risk tool for younger individuals in the general population, subjects aged 40 to 65 without prior cardiovascular disease from 3 population-based cohorts were included. Cox proportional hazards models were developed incorporating age, sex, systolic blood pressure, total and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, smoking, diabetes mellitus, hypertension treatment, family history of myocardial infarction, high-sensitivity C-reactive protein, and CAC scores (Astro-CHARM model [Astronaut Cardiovascular Health and Risk Modification]) as dependent variables and ASCVD (nonfatal/fatal myocardial infarction or stroke) as the outcome. Model performance was assessed internally, and validated externally in a fourth cohort., RESULTS: The derivation study comprised 7382 individuals with a mean age 51 years, 45% women, and 55% nonwhite. The median CAC was 0 (25th, 75th [0,9]), and 304 ASCVD events occurred in a median 10.9 years of follow-up. The c-statistic was 0.784 for the risk factor model, and 0.817 for Astro-CHARM ( P<0.0001). In comparison with the risk factor model, the Astro-CHARM model resulted in integrated discrimination improvement (0.0252), and net reclassification improvement (0.121; P<0.0001), as well. The Astro-CHARM model demonstrated good discrimination (c=0.78) and calibration (Nam-D'Agostino chi2, 13.2; P=0.16) in the validation cohort (n=2057; 55 events). A mobile application and web-based tool were developed to facilitate clinical application of this tool ( www.AstroCHARM.org )., CONCLUSION: The Astro-CHARM tool is the first integrated ASCVD risk calculator to incorporate risk factors, including high-sensitivity C-reactive protein and family history, and CAC data. It improves risk prediction in comparison with traditional risk factor equations and could be useful in risk-based decision making for cardiovascular disease prevention in the middle-aged general population.",Excluded
795,"Baseline analysis of use of denosumab in osteoporotic patients: Indications, compliance, adverse effect and tolerability Background Denosumab is a fully human monoclonal antibody that inhibits osteoclast activity, reducing bone loss. In the UK, use of denosumab was approved by National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) from October 2010 (TA204) [1]. Denosumab was used in Rheumatology Department, Queen Elizabeth Hospital, London from October 2010. Objectives We audited the indications for use of denosumab in these patients. Drug compliance, adverse effect and tolerability of the drug were also analysed. Methods 81 patients (female 77, male 4, age range 52 to 92 years, mean age 72 years) who commenced denosumab between October 2010 and December 2011 were identified retrospectively. 97% (79/81) of the patients come from their own home and 3% (2/81) come from nursing home. Patients' demographics, risk factors, fracture history, bone mineral density (BMD), spine and hip T score and previous osteoporosis treatment were assessed. 58 patients had follow up data and renal function was monitored every six months. Side effects were documented. Results Pre-treatment Dual-emission X-ray Absorptiometry (DXA) was available on all patients (mean BMD spine and hip 0.686 gm/cm2 and 0.705 gm/cm2, mean T score spine and hip -3.025 and -1.776). 87% (75/81) had failed treatment with both oral and intravenous bisphosphonates. 11% (9/81) had breast cancer and were on aromatase inhibitors. 16% (13/81) had mild renal impairment and 7% (6/81) had moderate renal impairment at the base line. 35.8% (29/81) of patients were found to have vitamin D deficiency at baseline and were treated. 9% (7/81) were on denosumab treatment for primary prevention of osteoporosis (T score range -2.3 to -4.1). All of these had failed oral medication previously. Four patients swapped from intravenous Ibandronate due to poor venous access. Use of denosumab was indicated clinically despite lack of specific risk factors suggested by NICE. All patients treated with denosumab for secondary prevention of osteoporosis (91%,74/81) met NICE criteria by virtue of previous fracture and failure of other treatments. Four men were treated off-license. 44% (36/81) had completed six month treatment and 27% (22/81) had completed one year treatment. All these patients were compliant to the drug.

1389,"Quantification of the chromosomal radiation damage induced by labelling of leukocytes with [18F]FDG Introduction: The aim of our work is to quantify the radiation damage in lymphocytes after labelling with [18F]FDG. Comparison with gold standard [99mTc]HMPAO labelling is established. An approach to cellular dosimetry is proposed. Method(s): Mixed leukocytes were separated from fresh venous blood and labelled with [18F]FDG and [99mTc]HMPAO following published guidelines. Cytokinesis-block micronucleus (CBMN) assay was performed for both sets of experiments. Tests for quality control of labelling described in guidelines were followed. Cellular dosimetry was calculated according to MIRD. Result(s): MN scored after labelling with 37. MBq of [18F]FDG were 956 +/- 172 and 347 +/- 26 for [99mTc]HMPAO (p < 0.05). Absorbed dose in cell nucleus was of 0.23. Gy for [18F]FDG and 0.08. Gy for [99mTc]HMPAO labelling. The CBMN assay after labelling with ~ 290 MBq of [18F]FDG showed radiation induced inhibition of proliferation capacity of the lymphocytes, confirmed by proliferation study. Conclusion(s): [18F]FDG labelling of mixed leukocytes causes severe radiation damage to the cell, higher than with [99mTc]HMPAO in accordance with the absorbed dose. Labelling of mixed leukocytes for clinical purpose induces high cytotoxicity reflected in the loss of proliferation capacity in lymphocytes this statement allows us to consider a low oncogenic risk however the association between MN formation in the PBL and subsequent risk of cancer is not well established. Advances in knowledge: This is the first work about radiation damage with [18F]FDG labelled cells. We focused on [18F]FDG labelling of leukocytes due to the growing number of research and review articles about this technique. Implications for patient care: The possibility of an increased risk of lymphoid malignancies associated with the administration of radiolabelled lymphocytes is a very controversial subject. Studies on radiation damage on new labelling procedures as the one exposed in this work must be considered.Copyright © 2015 Elsevier Inc..",Excluded
3534,"Effects of a closed space environment on gene expression in hair follicles of astronauts in the International Space Station Adaptation to the space environment can sometimes pose physiological problems to International Space Station (ISS) astronauts after their return to earth. Therefore, it is important to develop healthcare technologies for astronauts. In this study, we examined the feasibility of using hair follicles, a readily obtained sample, to assess gene expression changes in response to spaceflight adaptation. In order to investigate the gene expression changes in human hair follicles during spaceflight, hair follicles of 10 astronauts were analyzed by microarray and real time qPCR analyses. We found that spaceflight alters human hair follicle gene expression. The degree of changes in gene expression was found to vary among individuals. In some astronauts, genes related to hair growth such as FGF18, ANGPTL7 and COMP were upregulated during flight, suggesting that spaceflight inhibits cell proliferation in hair follicles.Copyright © 2016 Terada et al.

3420,"Safety and feasibility of robotic percutaneous coronary intervention: PRECISE (percutaneous robotically-enhanced coronary intervention) study Objectives: The aim of this study was to evaluate the safety as well as the clinical and technical effectiveness of robotic-assisted percutaneous coronary intervention. Background(s): Robotic systems have been suggested to enhance the performance of cardiovascular procedures, as well as to provide protection from the occupational hazards that are associated with interventional practice. Method(s): Patients with coronary artery disease and clinical indications for percutaneous intervention were enrolled. The coronary intervention was performed with the CorPath 200 robotic system, which consists of a remote interventional cockpit and a bedside disposable cassette that enables the operator to advance, retract, and rotate guidewires and catheters. The primary endpoints were clinical procedural success, defined as <30% residual stenosis at the completion of the robotic-assisted procedure without major adverse cardiovascular events within 30 days, and device technical success, defined as the successful manipulation of the intracoronary devices using the robotic system only. Result(s): A total of 164 patients were enrolled at 9 sites. Percutaneous coronary intervention was completed successfully without conversion to manual operation, and device technical success was achieved in 162 of 164 patients (98.8%). There were no device-related complications. Clinical procedural success was achieved in 160 of 164 patients (97.6%), whereas 4 (2.4%) had periprocedural non-Q-wave myocardial infarctions. No deaths, strokes, Q-wave myocardial infarctions, or revascularization occurred in the 30 days after the procedures. Radiation exposure for the primary operator was 95.2% lower than the levels found at the traditional table position. Conclusion(s): This pivotal multicenter study with a robotic-enhanced coronary intervention system demonstrated the safety and feasibility of the system. The robotic remote-control procedure met the expected technical and clinical performance, with significantly lower radiation exposure to the operator.

2553,"Examination of the optimal temporal resolution required for computed tomography coronary angiography Sub-second multidetector-row computed tomography systems provide great potential for the further improvement of CT coronary angiography (CTCA). However, because the temporal resolution (TR) of such CT systems is insufficient, blurring and artifacts produced by fast cardiac motion remain as unresolved issues. Previous TR investigations of CTCA were based on the retrospective electrocardiogram-gated multisegment reconstruction technique. However, the results obtained may not necessarily be correct because the TR of multisegment reconstruction may not be substantial due to the insufficient periodicity of cardiac motion. The optimal TR required for better CTCA images was evaluated with use of a dual-source CT system, which has various substantial TR modes (83, 125, and 165 ms). CTCA images of 147 patients with heart rates (HRs) ranging from 36 to 117 beats/minute (bpm) were evaluated visually on a 4-point scale. Our results revealed not only that the 165-ms TR is sufficient for low HRs (<=60 bpm), but also that the 83- and 125-ms TRs are unnecessary for such HRs. The image quality with the 125-ms TR mode was acceptable for the left anterior descending artery, left circumflex artery, and right coronary artery at low to intermediate HRs (<=70 bpm). At high HRs (>70 bpm), the 83-ms TR mode resulted in an excellent image quality for all cases except those with very rapid RCA motion. Adequate TRs for a wide range of heart rates (52-106 bpm) are thus clarified. © 2013 Japanese Society of Radiological Technology and Japan Society of Medical Physics.",Excluded
1980,"Severity of radiation pneumonitis, from clinical, dosimetric and biological features: a pilot study Background and objective: Radiation pneumonitis (RP) could be a lethal complication of lung cancer treatment. No reliable predictors of RP severity have been recognized. This prospective pilot study was performed to identify early predictors of high grade lung toxicity and to evaluate clinical, biological or dosimetric features associated with different grades of toxicity. Method(s): Sixteen patients with non-small cell lung cancer with indication of concurrent chemoradiotherapy using 60 Gy/2 Gy/fraction starting at cycle one of platinum based chemotherapy were included. Bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL), pulmonary function testing (PFT), and 18F-2-fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose positron-emission tomography was performed before radiotherapy (RT), after three weeks of treatment, and two months post-RT. For analysis, patients were grouped by grade (low [G1-G2] vs. high [G3-G5]). The two groups were compared to identify predictors of RP. Protein expression BAL and lung tissue metabolism was evaluated in two patients (RP-G1 vs. RP-G3). Categorical variables such as comorbidities, stages and locations were summarized as percentages. Radiation doses, pulmonary function values and time to RP were summarized by medians with ranges or as means with standard deviation. Longitudinal analysis PFT was performed by a T-test. Result(s): All 16 patients developed RP, as follows: G1 (5 pts; 31.3%); G2 (5 pts; 31.3%); G3 (5 pts; 31.3%); and G5 (1 pts; 6.1%). Patients with high grade RP presented significant decrease (p = 0.02) in diffusing lung capacity for carbon monoxide (DLCO) after three weeks of RT. No correlation between dosimetric values and RP grades was observed. BAL analysis of the selected patients showed that CXCL-1, CD154, IL-1ra, IL-23, MIF, PAI-1 and IFN-gamma were overexpressed in the lungs of the RP-G3 patient, even before treatment. The pre-RT SUVmax value in the RP-G3 patient was non-significantly higher than in the patient with RP-G1. Conclusion(s): RT induces some degree of RP. Our data suggest that decrease in DLCO% is the most sensitive parameter for the early detection of RP. Moreover, we detect biological differences between the two grades of pneumonitis, highlighting the potential value of some cytokines as a prognostic marker for developing high grade lung toxicity. Further multicenter studies with larger sample size are essential to validate these findings.Copyright © 2020, The Author(s).",Excluded
2043,"A comparison of neuron response properties in areas A1 and CM of the marmoset monkey auditory cortex: tones and broadband noise The purpose of this study was to compare response properties of two adjacent areas of the marmoset monkey auditory cortex. Multiunit responses to 50 ms tones and broadband noise bursts (BBN) were recorded in the core area, A1, and the caudomedial belt area, CM, of ketamine-anesthetized animals. Neurons in A1 and CM exhibited robust low-threshold short-latency responses to BBN and tones, whereas neurons in adjoining lateral belt areas were poorly responsive or unresponsive to tones and noise. Except for a population of broadly tuned units in CM, the characteristic frequency (CF) could be determined for all recording sites in A1 and CM. Both areas were tonotopically organized and shared a high CF border. Whereas the tonotopic gradient in A1 was smooth and continuous across the field, the gradient in CM was discontinuous, and the intermediate CF range was underrepresented. For BBN stimuli, rate level functions were largely monotonic in A1 and CM. Response profiles were also similar in both areas. As a population, neurons in CM were distinguished from A1 by significantly shorter response latencies, lower thresholds, and broader tuning bandwidth at higher intensities. The results indicated that, while A1 and CM represent anatomically and physiologically distinct areas, their response profiles under anesthesia overlapped considerably compared with the lateral belt areas. Therefore refinements of current models of the primate auditory cortex may be needed to account for differences in organization among the auditory belt areas.",Excluded

Result(s): Twenty-six patients were included in the analysis (median age 65 years, range 42-87). Nineteen received adjuvant RT, 4 exclusive RT, and the remainder palliative RT. Intensity-modulated RT was used in 13 cases, a 3D conformal technique in 11 cases, and stereotactic RT in 2 cases. No major toxicities were recorded. The median relapse-free survival (RFS) after adjuvant RT was 20.5 months, while for unknown primary MCC, it was 23 months. In the adjuvant setting, median polyomavirus-positive RFS was 21.5 months (range 1-49) and median polyomavirus-negative RFS was only 14 months (range 4-45). Overall, RFS of polyomavirus-positive and polyomavirus-negative patients was 10.5 and 8 months, respectively. After adjuvant RT, only 1 out of 10 patients had a recurrence in the RT field.

2625,"The impact of tumor volume and radiotherapy dose on outcome in previously irradiated recurrent squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck treated with stereotactic body radiation therapy Purpose: To assess the effect of stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) dose and tumor volume on outcomes in patients with recurrent, previously irradiated squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck. Material(s) and Method(s): A total of 96 patients with recurrent, previously irradiated squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck were treated with SBRT using Cyberknife and Trilogy-intensity- modulated radiosurgery. Kaplan-Meier survival analyses were used to estimate locoregional control (LRC) and overall survival rates. Response was evaluated using positron emission tomography/computed tomography or computed tomography and detailed physical examination. Result(s): The median follow-up for all patients was 14 months (2-39 months). The median dose of prior radiation was 68.4 Gy (32-170 Gy). Patients were divided into 4 SBRT dose groups: I (15-28 Gy/n = 29), II (30-36 Gy/n = 22), III (40 Gy/n = 18), and IV (44-50 Gy/n = 27). The median gross tumor volume (GTV) was 24.3 cm3 (2.5-162 cm). For GTV <=25 cm3 (n = 50), complete response rates were 27.8%/30%/45.5%/45.5%, and for GTV >25 cm3 (n = 46), complete response rates were 20%/25%/42.8%/50% for SBRT groups I-IV, respectively. The 1-/2-/3-year LRC rates for doses 40 to 50 Gy were 69.4%/57.8%/41.1%, respectively, whereas for 15 to 36 Gy, they were 51.9%/31.7%/15.9%, respectively (P = 0.02). The overall 1- and 2-year overall survival rates were 58.9% and 28.4%, respectively. Treatment was well tolerated with no grade 4/5 toxicities. Conclusion(s): Dose escalation up to 50 Gy in 5 fractions is feasible with SBRT for recurrent head and neck squamous cell carcinoma. Higher SBRT doses were associated with significantly higher LRC rates. Large tumor volume required higher SBRT doses to achieve optimal response rates compared with smaller tumor volume.

2613,"Facial basal cell carcinomas in elderly frail patients treated with low total-dose radiotherapy Aim: A retrospective analysis was performed in our two Institutions in order to evaluate the feasibility and reliability of a hypofractionated-radiotherapy regimen in the treatment of frail elderly patients with facial basal cell carcinomas (BCCs). Patients and Methods: The records of elderly patients (age >75 years) with histologicallyconfirmed BCC, T1-2, treated to a total radiation dose of 25-30 Gy over 5-6 weeks, were retrospectively analyzed. Result(s): From February 2007-December 2010, 134 ambulatory patients with 159 BCCs were treated. Their median age was 82.5 years (range=75-103). Grade 1-2 skin acute toxicities were observed in 30.6% of patients (41/134). Complete responses were observed in 157 tumors in 132 patients. At the last follow-up, June 2014, no late toxicities had been noted; three patients had local recurrent disease.

243,"Hepatic irradiation augments engraftment of donor cells following hepatocyte transplantation Engraftment of donor hepatocytes is a critical step that determines the success of hepatocyte transplantation. Rapid and efficient integration of donor cells would enable prompt liver repopulation of these cells in response to selective proliferative stimuli offered by a preparative regimen. We have earlier demonstrated that hepatic irradiation (HIR) in combination with a variety of hepatotrophic growth signals, such as partial hepatectomy and hepatocyte growth factor, can be used as a preparative regimen for liver repopulation of transplanted hepatocytes. In this study, we investigated the effects of HIR on engraftment of transplanted dipeptidyl peptidase IV (DPPIV)-positive hepatocytes in congeneic DPPIV-deficient rats. HIR-induced apoptosis of hepatic sinusoidal endothelial cells (SEC) within 6 hours of HIR resulted in dehiscence of the SEC lining in 24 hours. Although there was no change of the number of Kupffer cells after HIR, colloidal carbon clearance decreased 24 hours post HIR, indicating a suppression of phagocytic function. DPPIV + donor cells were transplanted 24 hours after HIR (0-50 Gy). There was an HIR dose-dependent increase in the donor hepatocyte mass engrafted in the liver parenchyma. The number of viable transplanted hepatocytes present in hepatic sinusoids or integrated in the parenchyma was greater in the HIR-treated group at 3 and 7 days after transplantation compared with the sham controls. Finally, we validated these rodent studies in cynomolgus monkeys, demonstrating that a single 10-Gy dose of HIR was sufficient to enhance engraftment of donor porcine hepatocytes. These data indicate that transient disruption of the SEC barrier and inhibition of the phagocytic function of Kupffer cells by HIR enhances hepatocyte engraftment and the integrated donor cell mass. Thus, preparative HIR could be potentially useful to augment hepatocyte transplantation. Copyright © 2008 by the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases.",Excluded

Uneven distribution of the dosage is provided by using a grid diaphragm and conducting gamma-therapy only from one static field during the whole course of irradiation. This pattern of radiotherapy is shown to increase radioresistance of normal tissues and allows 1.5--4 times large focal dose to be applied to tumor compared with gamma-therapy via moving lead strips, thus rendering an enhanced antitumor effect of radiation. These data are confirmed by the results of clinical observations over 30 patients with locally spread inoperable tumors of the retroperitoneal space.",Excluded
696,"A noninvasive objective measure of sunscreen use and reapplication OBJECTIVES: To study whether a noninvasive swabbing technique can detect sunscreen use for up to 6 hours, and whether the technique can detect reapplication of sunscreen., METHODS: Thirty volunteer office workers were randomly assigned to have one of a variety of sunscreens applied using recommended application techniques, and half were randomly assigned to have sunscreen reapplied after 3 hours. Alcohol-based swabs were used to obtain a sample from participants' arm at 20 minutes, and hourly from 1 to 6 hours post-application. Absorption readings were analyzed using an UV-visible spectrophotometer., RESULTS: The swabbing technique was consistently able to distinguish the sunscreen from control swabs for up to 6 hours. The absorption readings between 20 minutes and 6 hours were significantly higher than control swabs. There were no differences between the group that had sunscreen reapplied and the group that did not., CONCLUSION: The sunscreen swabbing technique is an effective noninvasive method for detecting a variety of sunscreen products in adults over a 6-hour period. No differences in absorption readings were found with sunscreen reapplication. This procedure will be a useful adjunct to other objective measures of sun protection and UV radiation exposure, resulting in a more accurate picture of the sun protection habits of individuals.",Excluded

Thirty-one CT examinations were performed using ATCM and a fixed tube voltage of 80 kVp (group A). Forty-nine CT examinations were performed using a standard protocol with a tube voltage of 120 kVp and a fixed tube current time product of 40 mAs (group B). Subjective and objective image quality and visibility of drug packets were assessed. Radiation exposure of both protocols was compared. Contrast-to-noise ratio (group A: 0.56 +/- 0.36; group B: 1.13 +/- 0.91) and Signal-to-noise ratio (group A: 3.69 +/- 0.98; group B: 7.08 +/- 2.67) were significantly lower for group A compared to group B (p < 0.001). Subjectively, image quality was decreased for group A compared to group B (2.5 +/- 0.8 vs. 1.2 +/- 0.4; p < 0.001). Attenuation of body packets was higher with the new protocol (group A: 362.2 +/- 70.3 Hounsfield Units (HU); group B: 210.6 +/- 60.2 HU; p = 0.005).

The aim of this study was to compare the efficacy of NAC plus IMRT and concurrent chemoradiotherapy (CCRT) plus adjuvant chemotherapy (AC) on locoregionally advanced NPC. Method(s): Between January 2004 and December 2008, 240 cases of locoregionally advanced NPC confirmed by pathologic assessment in Sun Yat-sen University Cancer Center were reviewed. Of the 240 patients, 117 received NAC followed by IMRT, and 123 were treated with CCRT plus AC. The NAC + IMRT group received a regimen that included cisplatin and 5-fluorouracil (5-FU). The CCRT + AC group received cisplatin concurrently with radiotherapy, and subsequently received adjuvant cisplatin and 5-FU. The survival rates were assessed by Kaplan-Meier analysis, and the survival curves were compared using a log-rank test. Multivariate analysis was conducted using the Cox proportional hazard regression model. Result(s): The 5-year overall survival (OS), locoregional relapse-free survival (LRRFS), distant metastasis-free survival (DMFS), and disease-free survival (DFS) were 78.0, 87.9, 79.0, and 69.8%, respectively, for the NAC + IMRT group and 78.7, 84.8, 76.2, and 65.6%, respectively, for the CCRT + AC group. There were no significant differences in survival between the two groups. In multivariate analysis, age (<50 years vs. >=50 years) and overall stage (III vs. IV) were found to be independent predictors for OS and DFS; furthermore, the overall stage was a significant prognostic factor for DMFS. Compared with the CCRT + AC protocol, the NAC + IMRT protocol significantly reduced the occurrence rates of grade 3-4 nausea-vomiting (6.5 vs. 1.5%, P = 0.023) and leukopenia (9.7 vs. 0.8%, P = 0.006). Conclusion(s): The treatment outcomes of the NAC + IMRT and CCRT + AC groups were similar. Distant metastasis remained the predominant mode of treatment failure.Copyright © 2016 Qiu et al.",Excluded
287,"Expanded Characterization of a Hemi-Body Shielded Gottingen Minipig Model of Radiation-induced Gastrointestinal Injury Incorporating Oral Dosing Procedures In collaboration with the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA), the authors recently conducted a pilot study in a hemi-body shielded model of radiation-induced gastrointestinal (GI) injury in Gottingen minipigs following exposure to radiation dose levels between 8-16 Gy. Herein, the impact of oral dosing procedures is assessed, as well as the specific causes of death in animals exposed to radiation doses of 14 and 16 Gy (n = 64; 32 male, 32 female, between 6 and 8 mo of age). Oral dosing using a 2-tablet placebo system comprised of both immediate release and enteric-coated tablets starting 24 h post-irradiation resulted in inhibited gastric emptying of the enteric-coated tablets, which were found to be retained in the stomach and/or regurgitated. This finding appears to be species-specific, as similar findings have not been reported for other large animal species (e.g., non-human primates). Mortality was primarily dictated by decreased activity, body weight loss (>35%), and/or respiratory distress, despite shielding of the lung. The cause of respiratory distress in animals that were pre-terminally euthanized varied according to the timing of death, with interstitial inflammation and extensive fibrosis observed >20 days post-irradiation. Kidney damage was also identified in most animals after day 10. Changes in the GI tract were consistent with previous studies and included collagen deposition/fibrosis. Observations of inflammatory infiltrates and interstitial inflammation/fibrosis in both shielded and unshielded organs support a strong secondary inflammatory syndrome post-irradiation.",Included

2796,"Influence of previous radiation exposure on pathologic features and clinical outcome in patients with thyroid cancer Objective: To determine whether previous radiation exposure to the head and neck is related to less favorable pathologic and clinical outcome in patients after surgical management of thyroid cancer. Design(s): Retrospective chart review. Setting(s): Academic teaching hospital (referral center). Patient(s): All patients with diagnosed thyroid cancer who had been exposed to radiation before surgical treatment were retrospectively identified from the thyroid cancer database at our institution (1963-2007). One hundred twenty-five patients (95 women and 30 men) were included. Inclusion criteria included surgical treatment for thyroid cancer and a history of exposure to radiation at least 3 years before diagnosis of the disease. Main Outcome Measure(s): Pathologic features and data related to disease recurrence, distant metastasis, and survival. Result(s): Mean (range) age at first exposure to radiation was 19.4 (1-65) years, and mean lag time to diagnosis of disease was 28.7 (3-60) years. Patients were treated surgically with either total or near-total thyroidectomy (83%) or partial or subtotal thyroidectomy (17%). Pathologic diagnoses included 111 papillary carcinomas (89%). Sixty- three percent of patients had multifocal disease, 12% had lymphovascular tumor invasion, and 26% had direct ex- trathyroid extension of disease. Twenty-five percent of patients had metastases to cervical lymph nodes, and 9% had distant metastases. Sixteen percent of patients experienced local recurrence of disease. At last follow-up, 86% of patients were alive and free of disease, 8% were alive with disease, 4% had died of thyroid cancer, and 2% had died of an unrelated cause. Compared with other patients with thyroid cancer, this radiation-exposed cohort was more likely to undergo total thyroidectomy, multiple operative procedures, and external radiotherapy. A higher percentage had multifocal disease, extrathyroid extension, stage IV disease, and distant metastases. At follow-up, fewer patients were free of disease, and more patients had died of thyroid disease. Conclusion(s): Patients who have been exposed to radiation have more aggressive disease and worse clinical outcome than other patients with thyroid cancer. © 2009 American Medical Association.

1264,"The role of adjuvant radiotherapy in the local management of desmoplastic melanoma BACKGROUND In the current study, the authors sought to evaluate outcomes, specifically with respect to adjuvant radiotherapy (RT), for patients with desmoplastic melanoma. METHODS The records of 130 consecutive patients who presented between 1985 and 2009 with nonmetastatic desmoplastic melanoma and were treated curatively with either surgery alone (59 patients; 45%) or surgery and postoperative RT (71 patients; 55%) were retrospectively reviewed. Ages ranged from 21 years to 97 years (median age, 66 years). The location of the primary tumor was in the head and neck region in 62% of patients. Only 5 patients (4%) had lymph node involvement at the time of presentation. RESULTS The median follow-up was 6.6 years (range, 11 months-24 years). Overall survival rates at 5 years and 10 years were 69% and 53%, respectively. Disease-specific survival rates were 84% and 80%, respectively, at 5 years and 10 years. The actuarial rate of local recurrence was 17% at 5 years and beyond. Of the patients who underwent surgery without receiving postoperative RT, 14 (24%) experienced local recurrence. Of the 71 patients treated with surgery and postoperative RT, 5 (7%) experienced local recurrence. In a Cox multivariate regression model, improved local control was significantly associated with the receipt of postoperative RT (P = .009).

Occipitocervical fixation has undergone significant evolution due to advances in operative techniques and instrumentation techniques. Objective(s): This study was done to evaluate clinical picture, radiographic findings and results of occipitocervical fusion in 10 patients with craniocervical instabilities. Also to compare these results with other results reported in the literature. Method(s): This retrospective study reviewed 10 patients who underwent occipitocervical fixation for craniocervical instabilities between April 2007 and October 2010 in Alexandria hospitals. There were 7 males and 3 females and their ages ranged from 16 to 63. years with mean age of 42.1. years. As regards the clinical presentation, all patients had presented with neck pain before surgery, 8 patients (80%) with myelopathy, and 8 patients (80%) had presented with a neurological deficit either motor or sensory or both. The etiologies of occipitocervical instability in this study were trauma in three patients, rheumatoid arthritis in three patients, tumor in two patients and Down syndrome in two patients. All patients had preoperative craniocervical plain X-ray, CT and MRI examination. All patients underwent occipitocervical fixation surgery with various fixation systems and autologous bone grafts for fusion. Fusion was assessed by plain cervical X-ray films and CT scan, and the neurological outcome by Frankel grade. The mean follow-up period was 14.7. months (range, 4-24. months) including both clinical and radiological examinations. Result(s): There were no operative mortalities or vascular injuries in this series. Two patients showed transient neurological deterioration postoperatively that had resolved within three months. Two cases had superficial wound infection and one case had cerebrospinal fluid leak. The mean operation time was 207. min (range 130-320. min) and the mean volume of blood loss was 354. mL (range 120-750. mL). Neck pain improved in all patients and no new instability developed at adjacent levels. Regarding the Frankel grade, five patients had shown improvement (Three patients improved from Frankel grade C to grade D, one patient from grade A to grade B and one patient from grade D to grade E), while five patients remained stationary at the same grade. At the last follow-up examination period, a solid fusion was achieved in nine patients out of ten (90%). Conclusion(s): Occiptocervical fixation is indicated in the management of craniocervical instabilities resulting from trauma, rheumatoid arthritis, tumors and congenital anomalies of the craniocervical junction. Accurate imaging studies and proper patient selection are the keys to a successful outcome. Occipitocervical fusion procedures can be performed with low morbidity.

Methods and Materials: We retrospectively investigated treatment outcomes and adverse events in 121 patients with advanced esophageal cancer who underwent concurrent chemoradiotherapy with CF-RT (n = 83) or DCF-RT (n = 38). In the CF-RT group, patients were administered cisplatin (70 mg/m2) and 5-fluorouracil (700 mg/m2) for 5 days; in the DCF-RT group, patients were administered docetaxel (50 mg/m2), cisplatin (50 mg/m2), and 5-fluorouracil (500 mg/m2) for 5 days. The radiotherapy dose was 1.8-2 Gy per session, up to a total of 50-60 Gy. Result(s): The complete response (CR) rate was 37.8% in the CF-RT group and 52.6% in the DCF-RT group. Overall survival (OS) rates at 2 and 3 years were 45.0% and 37.5%, respectively, in the CF-RT group and 62.9% and 56.7%, respectively, in the DCF-RT group, with a significant intergroup difference (p = 0.032). Progression-free survival rates at 2 and 3 years were 44.1% and 36.9%, respectively, in the CF-RT group and 45.0% and 45.0%, respectively, in the DCF-RT group (p = 0.10). Local control rates at 2 and 3 years were 59.1% and 54.6%, respectively, in the CF-RT group and 71.8% and 71.8%, respectively, in the DCF-RT group (p = 0.12). The incidence of Grade 3/4 leukopenia was 55.4% (n = 46) in the CF-RT group and 78.9% (n = 30) in the DCF-RT group, with a significant intergroup difference (p = 0.022). The incidence of Grade 3/4 neutropenia was 47.0% (n = 39) in the CF-RT group and 65.8% (n = 25) in the DCF-RT group, with a notable albeit not statistically significant difference between the groups (p = 0.054). There were no significant intergroup differences in anemia, thrombocytopenia, radiation-induced dermatitis, radiation esophagitis, or late adverse events. Conclusion(s): Rates of OS and CR were improved after treatment with DCF-RT compared with CF-RT.

2109,"Effect of intraocular scattering in macular pigment optical density measurements Fundus reflectometry is a common in-vivo, noninvasive method to estimate the macular pigment optical density (MPOD). The measured density, however, can be affected by the individual's intraocular scattering. Scattering causes a reduction in the contrast of the fundus image, which in turn leads to an underestimation of the measured density. Intraocular scattering was measured optically in a group of seven young, healthy subjects using the method of optical integration and was subsequently used to correctly estimate the MPOD from fundus images. It was shown that when scattering is not considered, the measured optical density using fundus reflectometry can be underestimated by as high as 16% for our group of subjects.Copyright (2018) COPYRIGHT Society of Photo-Optical Instrumentation Engineers (SPIE).",Excluded

2607,"Interval between neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy and surgery for squamous cell carcinoma of the thoracic esophagus does delayed surgery have an impact on outcome? Objective: Aim of this study was to evaluate whether delayed surgery after neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy (CRT) affects postoperative outcomes in patients with locally advanced squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) of the thoracic esophagus. Background(s): Esophagectomy is usually recommended within 4 to 6 weeks after completion of neoadjuvant CRT. However, the optimal timing of surgery is not clearly defined. Method(s): A total of 129 consecutive patients with locally advanced esophageal cancer, treated between 1998 and 2007, were retrospectively analyzed using prospectively collected data. Patients were divided into 3 groups on the basis of timing to surgery: group 1, <=30 days (n = 17); group 2, 31 to 60 days (n = 83); and group 3, 61 to 90 days (n = 29). Subsequently, only 2-numerically more consistent-groups were studied, using the median value of timing intervals as a cutoff level: group A, <=46 days (n = 66); and group B, <46 days (n = 63). Result(s): Groups were comparable in terms of patient and tumor characteristics, type of neoadjuvant regimen, toxicity, postoperative morbidity and mortality rates, tumor downstaging, and pathologic complete responses. The overall 5-year actuarial survival rate was 0% in group 1, 43.1% in group 2, and 35.9% in group 3 (P = 0.13). After R0 resection (n = 106), the 5-year actuarial survival rate was 0%, 51%, and 47.3%, respectively (P = 0.18). Tumor recurrence after R0 resection seemed to be inversely related, even if not significantly (P = 0.17), to the time interval between chemoradiation and surgery: 50% in group 1, 40.6% in group 2, and 21.7% in group 3. When considering only 2 groups, the overall 5-year survival was 33.1% in group A and 42.7% in group B (P = 0.64); after R0 resection, the 5-year survival was 37.8% and 56.3%, respectively (P = 0.18). The rate of tumor recurrence was significantly lower in group B (25%) than in group A (48.3%) (P = 0.02). Conclusion(s): Delayed surgery after neoadjuvant chemoradiation does not compromise the outcomes of patients with locally advanced SCC of the esophagus. Delaying surgery up to 90 days offers relevant advantages in the clinical management of the patients, can reduce tumor recurrences, and may improve prognosis after complete R0 resection surgery.

573,"Safety of 14C-UBT for diagnosis of Helicobacter pylori infection in pregnancy QUESTION: A 29-year-old woman had a carbon 14 urea breath test for diagnosis of Helicobacter pylori infection. At time of consultation, it had been 6 weeks since her last menstrual period. Four weeks after her last menstrual period, the results of a urine pregnancy test were negative. On that day, she received an ionizing radiation dose of 74 KBq (2 microCi) carbon 14 urea, followed by the breath test 30 minutes thereafter. Four days later, when the urine pregnancy test results turned positive, she was concerned about the possible effect of her exposure to ionizing radiation on the developing fetus. ANSWER: The amount of radiation used in these tests is extremely low-much lower than the amount a pregnant woman is absorbing through natural sources. [References: 10]",Excluded
1065,"Suboptimal response to ferrous sulfate in iron-deficient patients taking omeprazole Iron deficiency anemia is commonly encountered in outpatient practice. Gastric acid is one of the important factors for optimum absorption of iron. Proton pump inhibitors are very commonly prescribed medications. One of the debated effects of proton pump inhibitors is on oral iron absorption. Their effect on absorption of oral iron supplementation in iron-deficient patients has not been studied. At the Cooper Hematology Outpatient office, we reviewed charts of iron-deficient anemic patients who were on omeprazole for the last 4 years. Fifty patients having no apparent ongoing blood loss, having other causes of anemia especially that of chronic diseases ruled out, and on omeprazole while starting ferrous sulfate therapy for iron deficiency were selected for chart review. The iron-study results at the start of oral ferrous sulfate therapy and at 3 months follow-up were compared to evaluate the response of ferrous sulfate. The mean hemoglobin change was 0.8 +/- 1.2 g/L. The mean change in ferrtin values was 10.2 +/- 7.8 mug/L. Only 16% of the patients had a normal response to hemoglobin levels (rise of >2 g/dL), and only 40% had a normal response to ferritin levels (rise of >20 mug/dL). The average age of patients having a suboptimal response to both hemoglobin and ferritin was significantly higher compared with that of the patients with an optimal response. Omeprazole and possibly all proton pump inhibitors decrease the absorption of oral iron supplementation. Iron-deficient patients taking proton pump inhibitors may have to be treated with high dose iron therapy for a longer duration or with intravenous iron therapy.",Excluded
2064,"Role of Low-Dose Computerized Tomography in Lung Cancer Screening among Never-Smokers INTRODUCTION: The incidence of lung cancer among never-smokers has been increasing rapidly. The U. S. National Lung Screening Trial and the NELSON trial showed that screening using low-dose computerized tomography (LDCT) effectively reduced lung cancer mortality among heavy smokers. However, its effectiveness in never-smokers has not been well investigated. This study investigated the role of LDCT in lung cancer screening among never-smokers., METHODS: The study was designed as a single-center, retrospective cohort study. We analyzed the data on patients who underwent LDCT screening between May 2003 and June 2016. Nodules detected by computerized tomography were classified according to the Lung Imaging Reporting and Data System criteria. The detection rate and lung cancer outcomes (type of cancer, staging of lung cancer, and mortality) according to smoking history were determined., RESULTS: Of the 28,807 enrolled patients, 12,176 were never-smokers; of these patients, 7744 (63.6%) were women and 1218 (10.0%) were found to have lung nodules. Overall, lung cancer was diagnosed in 55 never-smokers (0.45%). In contrast, lung cancer was diagnosed in 143 (0.86%) of the 16,631 ever-smokers. Of the never-smokers with lung cancer, 51 (92.7%) presented with stage I disease, and all patients had adenocarcinomas., CONCLUSIONS: In the never-smoker population, LDCT screening helped to detect a significant number of lung cancers. Most of these lung cancers were detected at a very early stage. The positive results of the National Lung Screening Trial in the United States and the NELSON trial may have established the value of LDCT screening for heavy smokers, but future research should consider the value of using LDCT screening in the never-smoker population.

2727,"Deciphering acute shoulder trauma with normal initial X-ray: Contributions of ultrasonography and MRI Introduction: Shoulder trauma with normal radiographs is a frequent emergency presentation. The predominance of pain makes clinical examination unreliable, and complementary imaging is often needed for diagnosis. The aim of the present study was to assess the contribution of ultrasonography (US) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in deciphering such trauma. The study hypothesis was that MRI can confirm most diagnoses and reveal occult lesions. Method(s): 48 patients with a median age of 33 years (IQR, 22-48.75), admitted to the Emergency Department between February and September 2016, were prospectively included. All had normal X-ray and underwent emergency and deferred emergency (D + 7-10) clinical examination, and US and MRI at D + 7-14. The same examinations were repeated to establish diagnosis and initiate treatment. MRI was considered as gold-standard for definite diagnosis. Result(s): Diagnoses comprised: 14 shoulder contusions; 13 rotator cuff tears; 8 acromioclavicular sprains; 6 fractures: 3 greater tuberosity, 2 humeral head, 1 lateral quarter of the clavicle; 3 subluxations or anterior dislocations with spontaneous reduction; 1 posterior dislocation with spontaneous reduction; 1 case of resorption of calcification in the pectoralis major tendon; 1 case of coracobrachialis strain; and 1 partial pectoralis major detachment. Concordance with final diagnosis was 42% (20/48) on initial clinical examination and 52% (25/48) on reassessment. On US, concordance was 71% (34/48), with 82% positive predictive value for cuff tear and 0% for instability. MRI was contributive in all cases, revealing 48 abnormal signals in 41 patients, thus establishing 48 diagnoses. Conclusion(s): Except in precise diagnostic situations such as rotator cuff tear, US is not a contributive examination, completely overlooking shoulder instability and bone contusion. MRI should play an increasing role in deciphering these traumas. Level of Evidence: II; prospective cohort study.Copyright © 2021 Elsevier Masson SAS",Excluded
3633,"Lung cancer and cigarette smoking in Europe: An update of risk estimates and an assessment of inter-country heterogeneity Ten case-control studies have been carried out in 6 European countries to investigate the major risk factors for lung cancer. Carcinogenic effect from cigarette smoke was the most relevant interest in our study, which has included 7,609 cases of lung cancer and 10,431 controls, mainly population based. The results indicate elevated odds ratios (ORs; 23.9 among men and 8.7 among women) with attributable risks exceeding 90% for men and close to 60% for women. A large, and statistically significant, variability of the results across countries was detected after adjusting for the most common confounding variables, and after controlling, at least in part, for the instability of the ORs due to the small number of non-smokers in some of the study subsets. This pattern of lung cancer risk associated with cigarettes smoke, across different European regions, reflects inherent characteristics of the studies as well as differences in smoking habits, particularly calender periods of starting, and it is likely to have been influenced by effect modifiers like indoor radon exposure, occupation, air pollution and dietary habits. © 2001 Wiley-Liss, Inc.",Excluded
960,"RadRAT: a radiation risk assessment tool for lifetime cancer risk projection Risk projection methods allow for timely assessment of the potential magnitude of radiation-related cancer risks following low-dose radiation exposures. The estimation of such risks directly through observational studies would generally require infeasibly large studies and long-term follow-up to achieve reasonable statistical power. We developed an online radiation risk assessment tool (RadRAT) which can be used to estimate the lifetime risk of radiation-related cancer with uncertainty intervals following a user-specified exposure history (https://irep.nci.nih.gov/radrat). The uncertainty intervals constitute a key component of the program because of the various assumptions that are involved in such calculations. The risk models used in RadRAT are broadly based on those developed by the BEIR VII committee for estimating lifetime risk following low-dose radiation exposure of the US population for eleven site-specific cancers. We developed new risk models for seven additional cancer sites, oral, oesophagus, gallbladder, pancreas, rectum, kidney and brain/central nervous system (CNS) cancers, using data from Japanese atomic bomb survivors. The lifetime risk estimates are slightly higher for RadRAT than for BEIR VII across all exposure ages mostly because the weighting of the excess relative risk and excess absolute risk models was conducted on an arithmetic rather than a logarithmic scale. The calculator can be used to estimate lifetime cancer risk from both uniform and non-uniform doses that are acute or chronic. It is most appropriate for low-LET radiation doses < 1 Gy, and for individuals with life-expectancy and cancer rates similar to the general population in the US.",Excluded

At presentation, males reported severe erectile dysfunction that was significantly associated with age. However, only in sexual desire was the difference between baseline and phase 3 significant. In females, an improvement was observed in all parameters of FSFI between phase 1 and 3. Females with stage III disease achieved lower scores in almost all parameters of FSFI than those with stage II. Finally, although a quarter of patients reported elevated depression scores, depression was not related to sexual function., CONCLUSION: A significant proportion of cancer patients experience intense levels of sexual dysfunction and depression throughout radiotherapy and the subsequent year.

2274,"Fractures of the sacrum after chemoradiation for rectal carcinoma: Incidence, risk factors, and radiographic evaluation Purpose: Sacral insufficiency fractures after adjuvant radiation for rectal carcinoma can present similarly to recurrent disease. As a complication associated with pelvic radiation, it is important to be aware of the incidence and risk factors associated with sacral fractures in the clinical assessment of these patients. Methods and Materials: Between 1998 and 2007, a total of 582 patients with locally advanced rectal carcinoma received adjuvant chemoradiation and surgical excision. Of these, 492 patients had imaging studies available for review. Hospital records and imaging studies from all 492 patients were retrospectively evaluated to identify risk factors associated with developing a sacral insufficiency fracture. Result(s): With a median follow-up time of 3.5 years, the incidence of sacral fractures was 7.1% (35/492). The 4-year sacral fracture free rate was 0.91. Univariate analysis showed that increasing age (>=60 vs. <60 years), female sex, and history of osteoporosis were significantly associated with shorter time to sacral fracture (P=.01, P=.004, P=.001, respectively). There was no significant difference in the time to sacral fracture for patients based on stage, radiotherapy dose, or chemotherapy regimen. Multivariate analysis showed increasing age (>=60 vs. <60 years, hazard ratio [HR] = 2.50, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.22-5.13, P=.01), female sex (HR = 2.64, CI = 1.29-5.38, P=.008), and history of osteoporosis (HR = 3.23, CI = 1.23-8.50, P=.02) were independent risk factors associated with sacral fracture. Conclusion(s): Sacral insufficiency fractures after pelvic radiation for rectal carcinoma occur more commonly than previously described. Independent risk factors associated with fracture were osteoporosis, female sex, and age greater than 60 years. © 2012 Elsevier Inc.",Excluded

192,"Apparent migration of implantable port devices: normal variations in consideration of BMI PURPOSE: To evaluate the extent of normal variation in implantable port devices between supine fluoroscopy and upright chest x-ray in relation to body mass index (BMI) based on three different measurement methods.
METHODS: Retrospectively, 80 patients with implanted central venous access port systems from 2012-01-01 until 2013-12-31 were analyzed. Three parameters (two quantitative and one semi-quantitative) were determined to assess port positions: projection of port capsule to anterior ribs (PCP) and intercostal spaces, ratio of extra- and intravascular catheter portions (EX/IV), normalized distance of catheter tip to carina (nCTCD). Changes were analyzed for males and females and normal-weight and overweight patients using analysis of variance with Bonferroni-corrected pairwise comparison.
RESULTS: PCP revealed significantly greater changes in chest x-rays in overweight women than in the other groups (p&lt;0.001, F-test). EX/IV showed a significantly higher increase in overweight women than normal-weight women and men and overweight men (p&lt;0.001). nCTCD showed a significantly greater increase in overweight women than overweight men (p = 0.0130). There were no significant differences between the other groups. Inter- and intra-observer reproducibility was high (Cronbach alpha of 0.923-1.0) and best for EX/IV.
CONCLUSIONS: Central venous port systems show wide normal variations in the projection of catheter tip and port capsule. In overweight women apparent catheter migration is significantly greater compared with normal-weight women and with men. The measurement of EX/IV and PCP are straightforward methods, quick to perform, and show higher reproducibility than measurement of catheter tip-to-carina distance.",Excluded

In this study, we investigated the prognosis of AA with radiologic necrosis which is the representative radiologic finding of glioblastoma. From 1995 to 2010, we operated on 26 patients who were confirmed to have AA. The male:female ratio was 13:13, and the median age was 47.23 years. The mean follow-up period was 3 years. We analyzed the prognostic significance of radiologic necrosis with age, sex, KPS, tumour location, radiologic findings, extent of removal and radiation therapy oncology group recursive partitioning analysis (RTOG-RPA) classification. The median progression-free survival (PFS) was 0.5 (+/-0.17) years and the median overall survival (OS) was 1.6 (+/-0.40) years. In univariate analysis, the clinical variables of younger age (p = 0.030) and RTOG-RPA class III (p = 0.043) correlated with longer PFS, and KPS (p = 0.038), radiologic necrosis (p = 0.013) and the extent of removal (p = 0.041) correlated with OS. The median OS was 1.0 (+/-0.21) year in AA with radiologic necrosis compared to AA without radiologic necrosis, which showed 2.1 (+/-0.29) years median OS.

Few reports demonstrated similar results retrospective with a single k-wire. The aim of the study is to describe our single k-wire technique and evaluate the related results. METHOD(S): This is a retrospective study of a continuous series of patients treated with a single intramedullary k-wire for FFMN. It includes 30 patients who met the criteria for surgery: a dorsal angulation of more than 30degree, malrotation, or both. The mean clinical follow-up period was 7+/-14.9 months. RESULT(S): The mean pre-operative angle was 50degree+/-11.35degree and the mean immediate post-operative angle was 4.86degree+/-2.8degree. The mean immediate correction was 47degree+/-9.3degree. The mean correction at last follow-up was 45.14degree+/-8.55degree. Healing was obtained in all patients and bone union was achieved at a mean of 5.6+/-1.2 weeks. The mean operative time was 8.5 min. The mean C-arm usage (number of clicks) was 7.2 times. The mean exposure radiation time was calculated at 3.6 s. The mean radiation dose was 0.08 mGy/mm2. The mean satisfaction score was 1.26+/-0.45. Quick-DASH and EQ-5D scores yielded excellent values.

3678,"Effectiveness of salvage radiation therapy following subtotal and gross total resection of atypical meningiomas Purpose/Objective(s): Postoperative management of WHO Grade II (atypical) meningioma remains controversial. Radiation therapy (RT) has been shown to improve local control in several retrospective studies, but outcomes of adjuvant versus salvage RT after a gross total resection (GTR) are not well understood.We reviewed the outcomes of patients treated with RT after GTR and subtotal resection (STR) at our institution, where radiation therapy (RT) has typically been reserved for salvage. Materials/Methods: Between 1997 and 2014, 76 patients with WHO Grade II meningiomas were treated at our institution. One patient with NF2 was excluded from this analysis. Of the 75 remaining patients, 62 underwent GTR (Simpson grade I e III) and 13 STR (Simpson IV-V). No patient with GTR received adjuvant RT. A total of 22 patients received RT: 10 as salvage of recurrence following GTR, 10 as salvage following STR, and 2 adjuvantly, each after biopsy only. Fractionated RT was employed in 18 patients, with doses ranging from 50.4-60 Gy (median 59.4 Gy) in 28-33 fractions, and stereotactic radiosurgery in 4 patients, with a single fraction of 15-18 Gy (median 17 Gy). Result(s): Extent of surgery was significantly predictive of progression-free survival (PFS). Following GTR and STR respectively, 2-year PFS was 75% versus 33%, and 4-year PFS 68% versus 17% (P = 0.0008). Despite a significant improvement in PFS after GTR, patients who recurred following GTR had a poor response to salvage RT, with 6 of the 10 patients continuing to progress despite RT. Conversely, none of the 12 patients who had undergone STR or biopsy experienced progression following RT. Respectively for GTR and STR, PFS following RT was 77% and 100% at 1 year, and 39% and 100% after 2 years (P = 0.04). Radiation dose was not significantly different between patients who progressed (median 56.7 Gy) and those who did not (median 60 Gy) following RT (P = 0.42). Likewise there was no difference in RT dose for those with GTR versus STR (median 60 Gy versus 59.4 Gy respectively, P = 0.94). Conclusion(s): In our patient cohort, salvage RT for recurrence following GTR was associated with a high rate of failure (61% at 2 years), whereas salvage or adjuvant RT following STR was effective, with no failures at 2 years. This data suggests that tumors recurring after GTR are biologically distinct from tumors that progress following STR. While extent of resection is predictive of PFS, the 4-year local failure following GTR alone was still 32%; therefore, adjuvant RT should be considered in this setting. Whether routine adjuvant RT following GTR of Grade II meningioma will significantly reduce subsequent failures remains to be determined. A randomized, prospective comparison of adjuvant RT after GTR is needed to resolve this question.",Excluded
3507,"Nicotinamide Phosphoribosyltransferase Upregulation by Phenylephrine Reduces Radiation Injury in Submandibular Gland PURPOSE: Radiation therapy for head and neck cancer commonly leads to radiation sialadenitis. Emerging evidence has indicated that phenylephrine pretreatment reduces radiosensitivity in the salivary gland; however, the underlying cytoprotective mechanism remains unclear. Nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase (NAMPT) is not only a key enzyme for the nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide salvage pathway, but also a cytokine participating in cell survival, metabolism, and longevity, with a broad effect on cellular functions in physiology and pathology. However, the regulatory events of NAMPT in response to the irradiated salivary gland are unknown., METHODS AND MATERIALS: The cell viability of primary cultured submandibular gland cells was determined using the PrestoBlue assay. NAMPT expression was measured using reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction and Western blotting in vitro and in vivo. Silent information regulator 1 (SIRT1) and phosphorylated Akt protein levels were examined by Western blotting. The cellular locations of NAMPT and SIRT1 were detected by immunohistochemistry. NAMPT promoter activity was assessed using the luciferase reporter gene assay., RESULTS: NAMPT was mainly distributed in the cytoplasm of granular convoluted tubule cells and ductal cells in normal submandibular glands. mRNA and protein expression of NAMPT was downregulated after radiation but upregulated with phenylephrine pretreatment both in vivo and in vitro. Moreover, the protein expression of phosphorylated Akt and SIRT1 was decreased in irradiated glands, and phenylephrine pretreatment restored the expression of both. SIRT1 was mainly located in the cell nucleus and cytoplasm in the normal submandibular gland. Phenylephrine dramatically enhanced the expression of SIRT1, which was significantly reduced by radiation. Furthermore, phenylephrine induced a marked increase of NAMPT promoter activity., CONCLUSIONS: These findings reveal the regulatory mechanisms of NAMPT expression, which help to understand the mechanism of the cytoprotective role of phenylephrine on irradiated tissues.

2034,"A preliminary experience of moderate-intensity stereotactic body radiation therapy for ultra-central lung tumor Purpose: Administration of stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) to ultra-central (UC) lung tumors, generally defined as those abutting the proximal bronchial trees, is difficult due to concerns about serious toxicities. Therefore, our institution has performed moderate-intensity SBRT. Patients and Methods: Patients with UC tumors underwent SBRT at a dose of 50-60 Gy in 10 fractions, with Dmax in the target volume not exceeding 110% of the prescribed dose. The primary outcomes were tumor response and overall survival (OS). Result(s): From January 2017 to September 2018, we treated eight patients who had been diagnosed with UC tumors. The median follow-up time was 8.6 months (range: 2.7-14.9). Five of the eight patients (62.5%) showed a complete response (CR), two (25%) had a partial response (PR), and one (12.5%) had stable disease (SD); the response and disease control rates were 87.5% and 100%, respectively. Seven patients were alive with no evidence of disease or with controlled disease until the last follow-ups, except for one patient who died due to a non-RT cause at 3 months after SBRT. One patient experienced grade 2 esophageal pain and another had grade 1 cough. No grade 3 or higher toxicities were reported. Conclusion(s): Moderate-intensity SBRT might aid in achieving good control of UC tumors without excessive toxicities. Future studies involving larger numbers of patients and longer follow-up times are warranted to confirm the efficacy and feasibility.© 2019, Copyright © 2019 Taylor & Francis Group LLC.",Excluded
1050,"Surgeon volume and adequacy of thyroidectomy for differentiated thyroid cancer Introduction. We aimed to determine influence of surgeon volume on (1) frequency of appropriate initial surgery for differentiated thyroid cancer (DTC) and (2) completeness of resection. Methods. We reviewed all initial thyroidectomies (Tx; lobectomy and total) performed in a health system during 2011; surgeons were grouped by number of Tx cases per year. For patients with histologic DTC >=1 cm, surgeon volume was correlated with initial extent of the operation, and markers of complete resection including uptake on I123 prescan, thyrotropin-stimulated thyroglobulin levels, and I131 dose administered. Results. Of 1,249 patients who underwent Tx by 42 surgeons, 29% had DTC >=1 cm without distant metastasis. At a threshold of >=30 Tx per year, surgeons were more likely to perform initial total Tx for DTC >=1 cm (P = .01), and initial resection was more complete as measured by all 3 quantitative markers. For patients with advanced stage disease, a threshold of >=50 Tx per year was needed before observing improvements in I123 uptake (P = .004). Conclusion. Surgeons who perform >=30 Tx a year are more likely to undertake the appropriate initial operation and have more complete initial resection for DTC patients. Surgeon volume is an essential consideration in optimizing outcomes for DTC patients, and even higher thresholds (>=50 Tx/year) may be necessary for patients with advanced disease.Copyright © 2014 Elsevier Inc.",Excluded

1744,"Sequence variants in cell cycle control pathway, X-ray exposure, and lung cancer risk: a multicenter case-control study in Central Europe Exposure to ionizing radiation (IR) results in various types of DNA damage and is a suspected cause of lung cancer. An essential cellular machinery against DNA damage is cell cycle control, which is regulated by several genes, including TP53, CCND1, and CDKN2A. Therefore, we hypothesized that the genetic variants in these three genes influence the predisposition of lung cancer (i.e., CCND1 G870A, CDKN2A Ala(148)Thr, TP53 Arg(72)Pro, and 16-bp repeat in intron 3) and that the effect of X-ray on lung cancer risk can be modified by the presence of these genetic variations. The study was conducted in 15 centers in 6 countries of Central Europe between 1998 and 2002. A total of 2,238 cases and 2,289 controls were recruited and provided DNA samples. Cases with positive family history were analyzed separately. The joint effect of X-ray and previous risk genotypes was assessed, and modification by sequence variants on X-ray dose-response relationship with lung cancer risk was evaluated. We found an overall effect of TP53 intron 3 16-bp repeats [odds ratio (OR), 1.99; 95% confidence interval (95% CI), 1.27-3.13], which was stronger among cases with family history of lung cancer (OR, 2.98; 95% CI, 1.29-6.87). In addition, our results suggested an interaction that was greater than multiplicativity between TP53 intron 3 16-bp repeats and multiple X-ray exposures (interaction OR, 5.69; 95% CI, 1.33-24.3). We did not observe a main effect of CCND1 G870A polymorphism; however, the dose-response relationship between lung cancer risk and X-ray exposures was modified by CCND1 genotype with no risk from X-ray exposures among subjects who carried G/G genotype, intermediate risk [trend OR for X-ray, 1.16; 95% CI, 1.05-1.27) among subjects with G/A genotype, and highest risk [trend OR for X-ray, 1.29; 95% CI, 1.12-1.49) among subjects with A/A genotype. Sequence variants in cell cycle control pathway may increase the risk of lung cancer and modify the risk conferred by multiple X-ray exposures. However, a definite conclusion can only be drawn on replication by different studies among individuals who are highly exposed to IR.",Included

3555,"Impact of 2.45 GHz Microwave Irradiation on the Fruit Fly, Drosophila melanogaster The physiological and behavioral influences of 2.45 GHz microwaves on Drosophila melanogaster were examined. Standing waves transitioned into heat energy effectively when passing through the insect body. On the contrary, travelling waves did not transit into heat energy in the insect body. This indicated that there was no concern regarding the thermal effects of microwave irradiation for levels of daily usage. However, we detected genotoxicity and behavioral alterations associated with travelling wave irradiation, which can be attributed to the non-thermal effects of the waves. Electron spin resonance (ESR) revealed that fruit flies possessed paramagnetic substances in the body such as Fe3+, Cu2+, Mn2+, and organic radicals. The temperature dependent intensities of these paramagnetic substances indicated that females possessed more of the components susceptible to electromagnetic waves than males, and the behavioral tests supported the differences between the sexes.",Excluded
1758,"Long-term functional and survival outcomes after induction chemotherapy and risk-based definitive therapy for locally advanced squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck Background The purpose of this study was to evaluate long-term outcomes after induction chemotherapy followed by ""risk-based"" local therapy for locally-advanced squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck (SCCHN). Methods Forty-seven patients (stage IV; >=N2b) were enrolled in a phase II trial. Baseline and 24-month functional measures included modified barium swallow (MBS) studies, oropharyngeal swallow efficiency (OPSE), and the MD Anderson Dysphagia Inventory (MDADI). Functional status was assessed at 5 years. Results Five-year overall survival (OS) was 89% (95% confidence interval [CI], 81% to 99%). A nonsignificant 13% average reduction in swallowing efficiency (OPSE) was observed at 24 months relative to baseline (p =.191). MDADI scores approximated baseline at 24 months. Among 42 long-term survivors (median, 5.9 years), 3 patients (7.1%) had chronic dysphagia. The rate of final gastrostomy dependence was 4.8% (2 of 42). Conclusion Sequential chemoradiotherapy achieved favorable outcomes among patients with locally advanced SCCHN, mainly of oropharyngeal origin. MBS and MDADI scores found modest swallowing deterioration at 2 years, and chronic aspiration was uncommon in long-term survivors. © 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",Excluded

The seeds were placed under computed tomography guidance in the region of the sciatic notch in 14 patients (78%); one patient had two implants performed. Unresectable disease in the presacral region was implanted at laparotomy in two patients. Mean dose delivered was 10,791 cGy (range, 4376 to 22,000 cGy) to an average volume of 29 cm3 (range, 5.1 to 84.77 cm3). Median length of follow-up after implant was four months; eight patients (44%) were monitored for three months or less, and five patients (28%) were monitored for at least six months. Stabilization/regression of disease and symptoms in the implanted volume was accomplished in 17 (94%) of 18 patients. At last follow-up, three patients (17%) had no evidence of disease and three patients had stable disease in the pelvis, totaling 34% local control of pelvic disease. A total of 12 patients (66%) had progression of pelvic disease. Morbidity, as a result of the procedure or radiation dose, was limited.

1674,"Measured anatomical distributions of solar UVR on strawberry production workers in Italy The exposure of outdoor workers to solar ultraviolet radiation (UVR) has been known for some time. Measurements of erythemally weighted UVR are usually related to days of exposure and to the anatomical distribution of UVR on the human body. The aim of this research is to describe the UVR exposure of workers during a strawberry production cycle in order to assess the UVR hazard and to identify the highest exposure in the anatomical distribution of UVR on the body during an entire agricultural production cycle. This research was carried out on the experimental farm (Azienda Agraria Didattico- Sperimentale) of Universita Politecnica delle Marche in Agugliano, Italy. A spectrometer was used to measure UVR, and electronic dosimeters were used to record UVR exposure. The measurements were carried out on all working days of the strawberry production cycle in 2012 during daily peak UVR levels. The daily UVR exposure geometric mean and the percentage ambient UVR in the strawberry production cycle were calculated and analyzed to assess the hazard for workers during the entire production cycle. The nape of the neck was the anatomical site most exposed to UVR. The mean daily UVR exposure on the nape of the neck was higher than 1.50 SED, the minimum value required to produce perceptible erythema in unacclimatized white skin, and a maximum value of 2.29 SED was measured. Real-time exposure data suggest that it may be useful to remind workers of the risks associated with UVR exposure. © 2014 ASABE ISSN 1074-7583.",Excluded

The goals of this study were to determine whether oropharyngeal rinsing and ingestion of misoprostol protect mucous membranes from the acute effects of irradiation, and to evaluate the quality-of-life (QOL) outcomes of patients receiving misoprostol. We report the results of the QOL outcomes of patients in this study., METHODS AND MATERIALS: A total of 33 patients with resected or intact cancer of the oral cavity, oropharynx, supraglottic larynx, or hypopharynx were registered to receive postoperative radiotherapy plus misoprostol or primary radiotherapy plus misoprostol. All patients were scheduled to receive 60-70 Gy at 2 Gy/d within 6-7 weeks. QOL and function were evaluated., RESULTS: A decrease in the QOL and function occurred in all areas covered by the questionnaire at the 6-week interval. This decrease was significant for eating, saliva, taste, and mucous. Of these significant factors, taste, saliva, and mucous consistency had not resolved by 12 weeks., CONCLUSION: Increased understanding of the impact of treatment on QOL and symptoms will formulate the rational design of toxicity interventions and enhance the multidisciplinary care of head-and-neck patients.",Excluded
2955,"Can the implementation of aerospace science in elementary school help girls maintain their confidence and engagement in science as they transition to middle school? There is a global crisis due to a lack of qualified applicants entering STEM careers, especially in science. Add the fact that women are greatly underrepresented in science, and the solution becomes obvious. Go to the source, and find out why girls as young as 12 years old are losing an interest in scientific endeavors that they once found to be captivating. This action research project sought to find out if the implementation of aerospace science, embedded both in the classroom and in an after school Space Club, could assist girls in maintaining their confidence and engagement in science overall as they transition to middle school. Furthermore, girls in fifth through seventh grade, who had previously been the teacher researcher's students, were included in the study in order to discover if their previous participation in a variety of authentic and ongoing aerospace activities had any impact upon their engagement in science as they entered the notable years of declined interest. The research took place at an international American school, Academia Cotopaxi, in Quito, Ecuador from September 2015 through April 2016. Data was collected through both qualitative and quantitative sources, and included attitude surveys, parent questionnaires, a writing prompt, photos, video, interviews and observations. Additionally, a control group was utilized in grades five to seven for purposes of comparison. Innovative activities included engaging and first-hand experiences with the Ecuadorian Civilian Space Agency (EXA), the National Aeronautics Space Administration (NASA), Space X and the Canadian Space Agency (CSA). Inquiry-based activities included, but were not limited to, experiences with: speaking live with both astronauts and cosmonauts on the International Space Station, robotics, rocketry, Skype chats with aerospace professionals, utilizing the Design Process, online resources and more. Findings suggested that embedding aerospace science in grade four, both during and after school hours, not only increased girls' interest and confidence in science, but also served to maintain and foster an interest in STEM as they transitioned to middle school.

3108,"Interactions between auditory 'what' and 'where' pathways revealed by enhanced near-threshold discrimination of frequency and position Partially segregated neuronal pathways (""what"" and ""where"" pathways, respectively) are thought to mediate sound recognition and localization. Less studied are interactions between these pathways. In two experiments, we investigated whether near-threshold pitch discrimination sensitivity (d') is altered by supra-threshold task-irrelevant position differences and likewise whether near-threshold position discrimination sensitivity is altered by supra-threshold task-irrelevant pitch differences. Each experiment followed a 2 x 2 within-subjects design regarding changes/no change in the task-relevant and task-irrelevant stimulus dimensions. In Experiment 1, subjects discriminated between 750 Hz and 752 Hz pure tones, and d' for this near-threshold pitch change significantly increased by a factor of 1.09 when accompanied by a task-irrelevant position change of 65 micros interaural time difference (ITD). No response bias was induced by the task-irrelevant position change. In Experiment 2, subjects discriminated between 385 micros and 431 micros ITDs, and d' for this near-threshold position change significantly increased by a factor of 0.73 when accompanied by task-irrelevant pitch changes (6 Hz). In contrast to Experiment 1, task-irrelevant pitch changes induced a response criterion bias toward responding that the two stimuli differed. The collective results are indicative of facilitative interactions between ""what"" and ""where"" pathways. By demonstrating how these pathways may cooperate under impoverished listening conditions, our results bear implications for possible neuro-rehabilitation strategies. We discuss our results in terms of the dual-pathway model of auditory processing.",Excluded
729,"A study of dentists' knowledge about dental radiology principles Background and Objective: The use of dental radiography is inevitable in order for disease diagnosis, assessment and monitoring. Radiogeraphy is potentially harmful due to the use of ionizing radiation. This study was conducted to evaluate dentists' knowledge about the principles of dental radiology. Method(s): This cross-sectional study was performed on 600 general dentists willing to cooperate with this study in Amol, Noor, Mahmoodabad and Sari cities located in Mazandaran province, Iran, in 2014. All the data were obtained by means of a questionnaire. The questionnaire included two parts; the first part surveyed demographic information, and the second part included 11 items about radiographic technique and equipments. Finding(s): 500 questionnaires were completed. Among the surveyed population, 335 (67%) and 165 (33%) dentists were male and female, respectively.

1887,"Identification of the most important features of knee osteoarthritis structural progressors using machine learning methods Objectives: The aim was to identify the most important features of structural knee osteoarthritis (OA) progressors and classification using machine learning methods. Method(s): Participants, features and outcomes were from the Osteoarthritis Initiative. Features were from baseline (1107), including articular knee tissues (135) assessed by quantitative magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). OA progressors were ascertained by four outcomes: cartilage volume loss in medial plateau at 48 and 96 months (Prop_CV_48M, 96M), Kellgren-Lawrence (KL) grade 2 and medial joint space narrowing (JSN) 1 at 48 months. Six feature selection models were used to identify the common features in each outcome. Six classification methods were applied to measure the accuracy of the selected features in classifying the subjects into progressors and non-progressors. Classification of the best features was done using an automatic machine learning interface and the area under the curve (AUC). To prioritize the top five features, sparse partial least square (sPLS) method was used. Result(s): For the classification of the best common features in each outcome, Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) achieved the highest AUC in Prop_CV_96M, KL and JSN (0.80, 0.88, 0.95), and Gradient Boosting Machine for Prop_CV_48M (0.70). sPLS showed the baseline top five features to predict knee OA progressors are the joint space width, mean cartilage thickness of the medial tibial plateau and sub-regions and JSN. Conclusion(s): In this comprehensive study using a large number of features (n = 1107) and MRI outcomes in addition to radiological outcomes, we identified the best features and classification methods for knee OA structural progressors. Data revealed baseline X-ray and MRI-based features could predict early OA knee progressors and that MLP is the best classification method.Copyright © The Author(s), 2020.",Excluded
1651,"Low dose radiotherapy is associated with local complications but not disease control in sacral chordoma BACKGROUND: We reviewed the disease control and complications of the treatment of sacrococcygeal chordoma from four tertiary cancer centers with emphasis on the effects of radiotherapy in surgically treated patients., METHODS: A total of 193 patients with primary sacrococcygeal chordoma from 1990 to 2015 were reviewed. There were 124 males, with a mean age of 59 +/- 15 years and a mean follow-up of 7 +/- 4 years. Eighty-nine patients received radiotherapy with a mean total dose of 61.8 +/- 10.9 Gy., RESULTS: The 10-year disease-free and disease-specific survival was 58% and 72%, respectively. Radiation was not associated with local recurrence (hazard ratio [HR], 1.13; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.59-2.17; P = 0.71), metastases (HR, 0.93; 95% CI, 0.45-1.91; P = 0.85) or disease-specific survival (HR, 0.96; 95% CI, 0.46-2.00; P = 0.91). Higher doses (>=70 Gy; HR, 0.52; 95% CI, 0.20-1.32; P = 0.17) may be associated with reduced local recurrence. Radiotherapy was associated with wound complications (HR, 2.76; 95% CI, 1.64-4.82;, P < 0.001) and sacral stress fractures (HR, 4.73; 95% CI, 1.88-14.38; P < 0.001)., CONCLUSIONS: In this multicenter review, radiotherapy was not associated with tumor outcome but associated with complications. The routine use of radiotherapy with en-bloc resection of sacrococcygeal chordomas should be reconsidered in favor of a selective, individualized approach with a radiation dose of >=70 Gy.

780,"The pattern and time course of somatosensory changes in the human UVB sunburn model reveal the presence of peripheral and central sensitization The ultraviolet B (UVB) sunburn model was characterized with a comprehensive battery of quantitative sensory testing (QST). Primary hyperalgesia in UVB-irradiated skin and secondary hyperalgesia in adjacent nonirradiated skin were studied in 22 healthy subjects 24h after irradiation with UVB at 3-fold minimal erythema dose of a skin area 5 cm in diameter at the thigh and compared to mirror-image contralateral control areas. The time course of hyperalgesia over 96 h was studied in a subgroup of 12 subjects. Within the sunburn area, cold hyperesthesia (P=.01), profound generalized hyperalgesia to heat (P<.001), cold (P<.05), pinprick and pressure (P<.001), and mild dynamic mechanical allodynia (P<.001) were present. The finding of cold hyperalgesia and cold hyperesthesia is new in this model. The sunburn was surrounded by large areas of pinprick hyperalgesia (mean+/-SEM, 218+/-32 cm(2)) and a small rim of dynamic mechanical allodynia but no other sensory changes. Although of smaller magnitude, secondary hyperalgesia and dynamic mechanical allodynia adjacent to the UVB-irradiated area were statistically highly significant. Primary and secondary hyperalgesia developed in parallel within hours, peaked after 24-32 h, and lasted for more than 96 h. These data reveal that the UVB sunburn model activates a broad spectrum of peripheral and central sensitization mechanisms and hence is a useful human surrogate model to be used as a screening tool for target engagement in phases 1 and 2a of drug development.

3060,"Ultraviolet-A1 phototherapy modulates Th1/Th2 and Tc1/Tc2 balance in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus Objective. Ultraviolet-A1 (UVA1) phototherapy is effective for a variety of dermatological diseases. We examined the effectiveness and reliability of low-dose UVA1 phototherapy (60kJ/m2/treatment) in patients suffering from systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). We studied the changes in immunological parameters. Methods. The patients received a 9-week course of phototherapy according to the following regimen: five times a week during the first 3 weeks, three times a week during the second 3 weeks and twice during the last 3 weeks. Among other things, we analysed the proportions of T helper 1 (Th1), Th2, T cytotoxic (Tc1) and Tc2 cell populations in the peripheral blood of patients by flow cytometric detection of intracytoplasmic interferongamma (IFN-gamma) and interleukin 4 (IL-4). Results. Our study showed the improvement of clinical symptoms determined by the subjective clinical disease activity scoring and the SLE Disease Activity Index (SLEDAI). By the end of UVA1 phototherapy, the mean value of SLEDAI had decreased from 7.2+/-5.6 to 0.9+/-1.8, which was significant (P = 0.005). Immunological investigations detected a decrease in the frequency of IFN-gamma-producing Th1 and Tc1 cells and a decrease in the Th1/Th2 and Tc1/Tc2 ratios after UVA1 therapy. Conclusion. According to the literature, IFN-gamma has a pathogenic role in the development of SLE. We observed a decreased proportion of IFN-gamma-secreting cells, which we think is presumably one of the beneficial effects of UVA1 therapy. On the basis of our study, UVA1 phototherapy does seem to be an effective adjuvant in the treatment of SLE patients. © The Author 2005.

2745,"A sensitive abeta oligomer assay discriminates Alzheimer's and aged control cerebrospinal fluid A hallmark of Alzheimer's disease (AD) brain is the amyloid beta (Abeta) plaque, which is comprised of Abeta peptides. Multiple lines of evidence suggest that Abeta oligomers are more toxic than other peptide forms. We sought to develop a robust assay to quantify oligomers from CSF. Antibody 19.3 was compared in one-site and competitive ELISAs for oligomer binding specificity. A two-site ELISA for oligomers was developed using 19.3 coupled to a sensitive, bead-based fluorescent platform able to detect single photons of emitted light. The two-site ELISA was >2500x selective for Abeta oligomers over Abeta monomers with a limit of detection ~ 0.09 pg/ml in human CSF. The lower limit of reliable quantification of the assay was 0.18 pg/ml and the antibody pairs recognized Abeta multimers comprised of either synthetic standards, or endogenous oligomers isolated from confirmed human AD and healthy control brain. Using the assay, a significant 3- to 5-fold increase in Abeta oligomers in human AD CSF compared with comparably aged controls was demonstrated. The increase was seen in three separate human cohorts, totaling 63 AD and 54 controls. CSF oligomers ranged between 0.1 and 10 pg/ml. Abeta oligomer levels did not strongly associate with age or gender, but had an inverse correlation with MMSE score. The C statistic for the Abeta oligomer ROC curve was 0.86, with 80% sensitivity and 88% specificity to detect AD, suggesting reasonable discriminatory power for the AD state and the potential for utility as a diagnostic marker.",Excluded

METHOD(S): Randomized double-blinded crossover study to evaluate the effect of topical oral application of 2 per thousand morphine solution in patients suffering from radiotherapy- and/or chemotherapy-induced OM. Participants assigned to either the morphine solution or a placebo mouthwash received one of the solutions days 1-3 and were then switched over to the other treatment for days 4-6. RESULT(S): Nine patients were randomized in both groups. All patients (mean age, 55.1 +/- 3.0) except one had head and neck cancers. Mean intensity of pain associated with mucosal injury (World Health Organization [WHO] mucositis > or =2) was on a 10-point visual analogue scale: 6.0 +/- 2.7). The analysis of variance (ANOVA) model that included morphine or placebo, day and time of mouthwash, and mouthwash effect shows that pain alleviation 1 hour after mouthwash was significantly influenced by the gesture of the mouthwash (p < 0.001 with either morphine or placebo) and almost by the efficiency of morphine (p = 0.020). Duration of pain relief was 123.7 (standard deviation [SD] +/- 98.2) minutes for morphine. Most other reported symptoms were present at the baseline and were probably associated with the main disease and not secondary to the morphine mouthwash. CONCLUSION(S): Our results suggest a possible analgesic effect of topical morphine in line with previous studies. However, more efforts must be made for the adjustment of systemic analgesics and the development of new alternatives to treat locally OM-associated pain.",Excluded

After photoactivation with far red light, MLu facilitates production of cytotoxic oxygen radicals that mediate apoptosis. We assessed the safety and tolerability of phototherapy (PT) with MLu in patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention with stent deployment., METHODS AND RESULTS: An open-label, phase I, drug and light dose-escalation clinical trial of MLu PT enrolled 80 patients undergoing de novo coronary stent deployment. MLu was administered to 79 patients by intravenous infusion 18 to 24 hours before procedure, and photoactivation was performed after balloon predilatation and before stent deployment. Clinical evaluation, serial quantitative angiography, and intravascular ultrasound were performed periprocedurally and at 6 months follow-up. MLu PT was well tolerated without serious dose-limiting toxicities, and side effects (paresthesia and rash) were minor. No adverse angiographic outcomes were attributed to phototherapy., CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates that coronary MLu PT seems safe, and the maximum well-tolerated MLu dose and range of tolerated light doses were identified. These data can be used in phase II efficacy trials of MLu PT for the treatment of coronary atherosclerosis or vulnerable plaque.",Excluded
1863,"Effectiveness of gene expression profiling for response prediction of rectal cancer to preoperative radiotherapy Background: Our aim was to determine whether the expression levels of specific genes could predict clinical radiosensitivity in human colorectal cancer. Method(s): Radioresistant colorectal cancer cell lines were established by repeated X-ray exposure (total, 100 Gy), and the gene expressions of the parent and radioresistant cell lines were compared in a microarray analysis. To verify the microarray data, we carried out a reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction analysis of identified genes in clinical samples from 30 irradiated rectal cancer patients. Result(s): A comparison of the intensity data for the parent and three radioresistant cell lines revealed 17 upregulated and 142 downregulated genes in all radioresistant cell lines. Next, we focused on two upregulated genes, PTMA (prothymosin alpha) and EIF5a2 (eukaryotic translation initiation factor 5A), in the radioresistant cell lines. In clinical samples, the expression of PTMA was significantly higher in the minor effect group than in the major effect group (P = 0.004), but there were no significant differences in EIF5a2 expression between the two groups. Conclusion(s): We identified radiation-related genes in colorectal cancer and demonstrated that PTMA may play an important role in radiosensitivity. Our findings suggest that PTMA may be a novel marker for predicting the effectiveness of radiotherapy in clinical cases. © Springer-Verlag Tokyo 2007.",Excluded
3524,"Noninvasive evaluation of radiation-enhanced glioma cells invasiveness by ultra-high-field (1)H-MRS in vitro INTRODUCTION: Glioma is the most common type of the primary CNS tumor. Radiotherapy is an important treatment measure after surgery. However, its highly invasive character is the main reason of postoperative recurrence. The aim of the study was to probe the correlation between the invasion ability and the metabolite characteristics of glioma cells at the cellular level after irradiation by using 14.7T high-resolution nuclear proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy ((1)H-MRS)., METHODS: To determine the matrix metalloproteinase-2 (MMP-2) activity and metabolite ratios of glioma cells after irradiation with different doses of X-rays, U87 and C6 glioma cells were exposed to X-ray irradiation of 0, 1, 5, 10, and 15Gy. After 20h, the perchloric acid (PCA) extraction method was used to evaluate water-soluble metabolites [choline (Cho), creatine (Cr), and N-acetylaspartate (NAA)], and (1)H-MRS patterns and changes in metabolite ratios were observed in vitro by 14.7T high resolution (1)H-MRS. Matrigel invasion assays and gelatin zymography were performed to test the invasion ability of U87 and C6 glioma cells., RESULTS: Good MR spectra were obtained from PCA method extracts of U87 and C6 glioma cells. Both radiation-induced MMP-2 activity and the Cho/Cr and Cho/NAA ratios increased after irradiation, and their increase occurred in a dose-dependent manner. The MMP-2 activity and the Cho/Cr and Cho/NAA ratios of glioma cells increased after irradiation up to 10Gy and decreased thereafter. In particular, the Cho/NAA ratio of U87 cells increased from 3.55+/-0.06 (0Gy) to 9.13+/-0.30 (10Gy) and then declined to 5.94+/-0.15 (15Gy). Furthermore, the invasion ability of glioma cells had a strong positive correlation with the Cho/Cr and Cho/NAA ratios. Both the Cho/Cr ratio and the Cho/NAA ratio of U87 glioma cells were highly positively correlated with the number of invading cells in the Matrigel invasion assay. The Pearson's correlation coefficient (r) values of U87 cells were 0.89 (Cho/Cr ratio versus invasion ability) and 0.91 (Cho/NAA ratio versus invasion ability) (P<0.01). C6 cells exhibited similar changes to those of U87 cells., CONCLUSIONS: In vitro high-resolution (1)H-MRS is useful for detecting glioma invasiveness at the cellular level. Copyright © 2016.

1647,"X-irradiation removes endogenous primordial germ cells (PGCs) and increases germline transmission of donor PGCs in chimeric chickens Primordial germ cells (PGCs) are embryonic precursors of germline cells with potential applications in genetic conservation, transgenic animal production and germline stem cell research. These lines of research would benefit from improved germline transmission of transplanted PGCs in chimeric chickens. We therefore evaluated the effects of pretransplant X-irradiation of recipient embryos on the efficacy of germline transmission of donor PGCs in chimeric chickens. Intact chicken eggs were exposed to X-ray doses of 3, 6 and 9 Gy (dose rate = 0.12 Gy/min) after 52 h of incubation. There was no significant difference in hatching rate between the 3-Gy-irradiated group and the nonirradiated control group (40.0 vs. 69.6%), but the hatching rate in the 6-Gy-irradiated group (28.6%) was significantly lower than in the control group (P<0.05). No embryos irradiated with 9 Gy of X-rays survived to hatching. X-irradiation significantly reduced the number of endogenous PGCs in the embryonic gonads at stage 27 in a dose-dependent manner compared with nonirradiated controls. The numbers of endogenous PGCs in the 3-, 6- and 9-Gy-irradiated groups were 21.0, 9.6 and 4.6% of the nonirradiated control numbers, respectively. Sets of 100 donor PGCs were subsequently transferred intravascularly into embryos irradiated with 3 Gy X-rays and nonirradiated control embryos. Genetic cross-test analysis revealed that the germline transmission rate in the 3-Gy-irradiated group was significantly higher than in the control group (27.5 vs. 5.6%; P<0.05). In conclusion, X-irradiation reduced the number of endogenous PGCs and increased the germline transmission of transferred PGCs in chimeric chickens.",Excluded

Here we report the failure patterns in stage II-IV thymoma after RT at two tertiary referral centers, classified according to the new International Thymic Malignancy Interest Group definitions. METHOD(S): We reviewed 156 stage II-IV patients with thymoma treated with definitive (n=24) or adjuvant (n=132) RT. All RT was delivered without elective nodal irradiation (median dose 5040 cGy). Intrathoracic failures were classified as (1) in-field failures (within 100% isodose line [IDL]), (2) marginal recurrences (<100% and >=50% IDL), and (3) out-of-field failures (outside the 50% IDL). RESULT(S): The median follow-up was 61 months. Surgical margins were positive in 39%. The median tumor size was 9 cm. The 5-year cumulative incidence of all intrathoracic failures was 24% (n=34). Failures occurred within the RT field (n=5), marginally (n=1), out-of-field (n=22), and synchronously in- and out-of-field (n=6). The 5-year cumulative incidence of in-field failures was 7%. These were associated with Masaoka stage and tumor size. Macroscopically positive margins were associated with more local failures. Intrathoracic failures occurred most commonly in the pleural space (n=29) and lymph nodes (n=9). Patients with more advanced stage, and those treated with intensity-modulated radiation therapy had more intrathoracic failures. RT dose and chemotherapy did not impact failure patterns. CONCLUSION(S): Although there were few in-field failures in patients who received RT for stage II-IV thymomas, a high rate of out-of-field intrathoracic failures still occurred. Further study is necessary to identify treatment approaches that prevent pleural recurrences. Copyright © 2014 by the International Association for the Study of Lung Cancer.",Excluded
2387,"The characteristics of the cerebral asthenia syndrome in persons who were victims of the accident at the Chernobyl Atomic Electric Power Station A total of 107 patients (81 males, 26 females), their age ranging between 34 to 45 years, diagnosed as having discirculatory encephalopathy with underlying cerebrasthenic syndrome, were examined. All the examinees took part in the elimination of the Chernobyl accident effects in 1986. It was found out, that cerebrasthenia which is present in the structure of all clinical variants of organic affection of the brain is the most mobile (functional) link of the morbid process when a disorder sets in rather than the failure of the organ to perform its function. It ranks among other asthenic syndromes reflecting a specific character of exogenous radiation effect on the organism, being a result of a characteristic interaction between the organism and a health hazard. Measures to dispel the asthenic component at the initial stages of development of the disorder will make for reduction or arrest of progression of organic symptomatology.",Included
357,"Dynamic change of optical quality in patients with dry eye disease PURPOSE: To evaluate the dynamic changes of optical quality in patients with dry eye disease (DED) by using a double-pass system., METHODS: Fifty-six patients with DED and 35 control subjects were included in this study. Each patient underwent an evaluation of the ocular surface, using the Ocular Surface Disease Index, tear film breakup time (TBUT), corneal and conjunctival staining (Oxford scale), and Schirmer I test. Using the tear film analysis program of the Optical Quality Analysis System, we recorded the objective scatter index (OSI) every 0.5 seconds within a 20-second period with the subjects asked to blink freely. Several parameters were established to evaluate the dynamic alterations of optical quality and the effects of blinks: OSI standard deviation (SD), DELTAOSI, DELTAOSI/time, blinking change (BC), blinking frequency (BF), and tolerant limitation (TL)., RESULTS: Patients with DED had significant alterations of optical quality compared to control subjects. The DELTAOSI, DELTAOSI/time, BC, and BF were significantly higher and TL was significantly lower in DED patients than controls. Furthermore, the DELTAOSI and DELTAOSI/time were also significantly higher in patients with severe DED than patients with mild disease. In univariate analysis, both TBUT and corneal staining were correlated with DELTAOSI, DELTAOSI/time, and BC. In multivariate analysis, DELTAOSI/time was correlated to the corneal staining score., CONCLUSIONS: The double-pass system allowed the monitoring of the dynamic changes of optical quality in patients with DED. Optical quality should be evaluated in patients with DED because these alterations cannot be determined from the classical DED clinical tests.",Excluded

3447,"Multivariable normal-tissue complication modeling of acute esophageal toxicity in advanced stage non-small cell lung cancer patients treated with intensity-modulated (chemo-)radiotherapy Background and purpose The majority of normal-tissue complication probability (NTCP) models for acute esophageal toxicity (AET) in advanced stage non-small cell lung cancer (AS-NSCLC) patients treated with (chemo-)radiotherapy are based on three-dimensional conformal radiotherapy (3D-CRT). Due to distinct dosimetric characteristics of intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT), 3D-CRT based models need revision. We established a multivariable NTCP model for AET in 149 AS-NSCLC patients undergoing IMRT. Materials and methods An established model selection procedure was used to develop an NTCP model for Grade >=2 AET (53 patients) including clinical and esophageal dose-volume histogram parameters. Results The NTCP model predicted an increased risk of Grade >=2 AET in case of: concurrent chemoradiotherapy (CCR) [adjusted odds ratio (OR) 14.08, 95% confidence interval (CI) 4.70-42.19; p < 0.001], increasing mean esophageal dose [Dmean; OR 1.12 per Gy increase, 95% CI 1.06-1.19; p < 0.001], female patients (OR 3.33, 95% CI 1.36-8.17; p = 0.008), and >=cT3 (OR 2.7, 95% CI 1.12-6.50; p = 0.026).

3684,"Predictors of the therapeutic effect of corticosteroids on radiation-induced optic neuropathy following nasopharyngeal carcinoma Radiation-induced optic neuropathy (RION) is a severe visual complication resulting from radiotherapy of the head and neck, which mostly occurs in patients with nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) in the southern part of China. The mechanism of RION is unclear. Therefore, identifying risk factors for RION is an important step towards enhancing our understanding. In the current study, we retrospectively reviewed patients with NPC who were admitted to Sun Yat-Sen Memorial Hospital for visual loss between 2006 and 2017. The study included 38 participants (68 eyes) in the corticosteroid-effective group and 35 participants (64 eyes) in the corticosteroids-ineffective group. We analyzed potential risk factors for RION and developed a prediction model for the therapeutic effect of corticosteroid effect based on a random forests method. The prediction model showed a high accuracy with an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.932 (95% confidence interval = 0.889-0.975). Our results revealed that blood urea nitrogen (BUN) was significantly associated with RION and that RION patients with higher BUN levels responded better to corticosteroid treatment. Altogether, these results suggest that a prediction model, based on clinical factors, could be applied to estimate the therapeutic effect of corticosteroids on RION. Further investigation, however, is needed to confirm the study conclusion.Copyright © 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.",Excluded
1704,"Physiological reconstruction of the spine using dorsal correction spondylodesis in Scheuermann's disease - A retrospective analysis of 73 prospectively recorded cases Introduction: Posterior spinal fusion (PSF) and correction is the most frequently performed surgery in Scheuermann-associated hyperkyphosis. The aim of the study was to assess the extent of kyphosis correction, complications and clinical outcome after PSF. Material/Methods: Between 2014 and 2018, 73 patients with Scheuermann associated hyperkyphosis underwent surgery, were prospectively recorded and retrospectively analyzed. X-rays of the whole spine were analyzed pre- and postoperative as well as after 6, 12 and 24 months. Sagittal and coronary Cobb angles, pelvic parameters and sagittal profile were evaluated using a web-based analysis tool. Operation duration, complications, and blood loss were compared. Postoperatively, the clinical outcome was determined using standardized questionnaires (SRS22, EQ 5D) after 3, 12 and 24 months. Result(s): Thoracic structural kyphosis (UEV-LEV) was preoperatively measured with 75.11degree with a correction to 48.54degree (p<0.001). The Stagnara angles had an extent of 68.87degree with a correction to 38.68degree (p<0.001). Compensatory lumbar lordosis (LL) showed a correction from 68.24degree to 46.70degree (p<0.001). Using the highly negative pelvic incidence (PI) - LL mismatch (PI-LL pre-OP - 23.6 to PI-LL post-OP -1.3; p<0.001) we demonstrated significant compensatory hyperlordosis pre-OP with good spontaneous correction post-OP. The number of fused segments (11.2) correlated significantly with the degree of kyphosis (p<0.005) and kyphosis correction (p<0.001). The pelvic parameters (PI, pelvic tilt, sacral slope) were physiologically preoperatively and without changes in the follow-up X-rays. The most frequently uppermost and lowest instrumented vertebra was T2 (33 patients, 45.2%) and L3 (29 patients, 39.7%), respectively. Number of fused segments correlated significantly with surgery duration (mean 263.73 min, p=0.012) and blood loss (mean 750.56 ml, p=0.016). The initial degree of kyphosis showed significant correlation with the SRS mental health subscore(p=0.043). The degree of kyphosis had no influence on the other subscores and on the total SRS 22. Furthermore, the clinical outcome showed a gradual and significant improvement of SRS 22 and EQ 5D after 3 and 12 months. Postoperatively we recorded the following complications: neurological complication without neurological deficit (3.2%), implant-associated complication (6.3%) and wound healing issues (3.2%). Discussion(s): Using PSF we corrected the thoracic hyperkyphosis of M. Scheuermann from 75degree to 48degree and the lumbar hyperlordosis from 68degree to 47degree. We could achieve an almost physiological reconstruction of the sagittal alignment. The first clinical followup results were convincing with a significant improvement of SRS 22 and the EQ 5D already after 3 months. Complication rates were moderate (14.2%) and the risk of proximal junctional kyphosis with sufficiently long instrumentation after PSF alone is rare with 1.6% of cases.",Excluded
1182,"Clinical and Spectrophotometric Evaluation of Skin Photoadaptation in Vitiligo Patients after a Short Cycle of NB-UVB Phototherapy BACKGROUND: The phenomenon of photoadaptation to narrow-band ultraviolet B (NB-UVB) radiation has been previously described in vitiligo and has usually been clinically measured by the assessment of the minimal erythema dose (MED) after phototesting., OBJECTIVES: To assess the photoadaptive response in vitiligo and healthy skin after NB-UVB phototherapy not only clinically, but also by spectrophotometry., MATERIALS AND METHODS: Fourteen patients affected by generalized vitiligo underwent NB-UVB phototherapy twice weekly for 12 weeks. Before and after phototherapy, a phototesting procedure was administered on vitiligo patches and adjacent healthy skin with a solar simulated radiation (SSR). Visual assessment of the MED took place after 24 h. A spectrophotometer was used to assess the a* value and the melanin index (MI*), as signs of skin erythema and pigmentation. The photoadaptation factor (MED-PF) and the a* photoadaptation factor (a*-PF) were calculated., RESULTS: After NB-UVB phototherapy, both vitiligo and healthy skin showed an increase in MED and MI* values and a reduction of skin erythema compared to baseline (p < 0.05). MED-PF data showed a photoadaptation in 10 (71.4%) vitiligo lesions and in 12 (85.7%) healthy skin areas. The assessment of the a*-PF showed a negative mean percentage value in all affected and unaffected skin areas., CONCLUSIONS: A short cycle of NB-UVB phototherapy can induce photoadaptation in vitiligo by increasing the MED and reducing skin erythema after stimulation with SSR. This is most likely due to the physical filter function induced by ultraviolet radiation. Copyright © 2019 S. Karger AG, Basel.",Excluded
753,"Postoperative chemoradiotherapy in gastric cancer-a phase I-II study of radiotherapy with dose escalation of weekly cisplatin and daily capecitabine chemotherapy Background: Postoperative chemoradiotherapy with concurrent 5-fluorouracil improves gastric cancer outcome. We previously demonstrated that chemoradiotherapy with a more intensified-and therefore potentially more effective-schedule with daily cisplatin and oral capecitabine is feasible. Because such an intensive schedule requires an extensive logistic infrastructure which is not available in every hospital, we additionally investigated the tolerability of this combined regimen with weekly instead of daily cisplatin in a dose-escalation study. Patients and Methods: After R0 or R1 resection, treatment initiated with capecitabine 1000 mg/m2 b.i.d. for 2 weeks and 1-week rest. Subsequently, patients received capecitabine (575-650 mg/m2 orally b.i.d., 5 days/week) and cisplatin (20-25 mg/m2 i.v., once weekly) according to a predefined dose-escalation schedule concurrent with radiation. Radiotherapy was given to a fixed total dose of 45 Gy in 25 fractions. Result(s): Thirty-one patients were eligible and started treatment. During chemoradiotherapy, seven patients developed 10 items of grade III and one episode of grade IV (mainly hematological) toxicity (National Cancer Institute-Common Toxicity Criteria version 3.0). The maximum tolerable dose was determined to be for cisplatin 20 mg/m2 i.v. weekly and for capecitabine 575 mg/m2 b.i.d. orally. Conclusion(s): This phase I-II study demonstrated that postoperative chemoradiotherapy with weekly cisplatin and daily capecitabine is feasible in gastric cancer at the defined dose level.

96,"Analysis of DNA repair gene polymorphisms in glioblastoma BACKGROUND: Glioblastoma is the most common and aggressive primary brain tumor in adults. Despite several factors such as ionizing radiation exposure or rare genetic syndromes have been associated with the development of glioblastoma, no underlying cause has been identified for the majority of cases. We thus aimed to investigate the role of DNA repair polymorphisms in modulating glioblastoma risk., METHODS: Genotypic and allelic frequencies of seven common polymorphisms in DNA repair genes involved in nucleotide excision repair (ERCC1 rs11615, ERCC2 rs13181, ERCC6 rs4253079), base excision repair (APEX1 rs1130409, XRCC1 rs25487), double-strand break repair (XRCC3 rs861539) and mismatch repair (MLH1 rs1800734) pathways were analyzed in 115 glioblastoma patients and 200 healthy controls. Haplotype analysis was also performed for ERCC1 rs11615 and ERCC2 rs13181 polymorphisms, located on the same chromosomal region (19q13.32)., RESULTS: Our results indicated that carriers of the ERCC2 Gln/Gln genotype were associated with a lower glioblastoma risk (OR=0.32, 95% CI 0.12-0.89; P=0.028), whereas carriers of the MLH1 AA genotype were associated with an increased risk of glioblastoma (OR=3.14, 95% CI 1.09-9.06; P=0.034). Furthermore, the haplotype containing the C allele of ERCC2 rs13181 polymorphism and the T allele of ERCC1 rs11615 polymorphism was significantly associated with a protective effect of developing glioblastoma (OR=0.34, 95% CI 0.16-0.71; P=0.004)., CONCLUSIONS: These results pointed out that MLH1 rs1800734 and ERCC2 rs13181 polymorphisms might constitute glioblastoma susceptibility factors, and also suggested that the chromosomal region 19q could be important in glioblastoma pathogenesis.

690,"Comparison of Machine Learning Optimal Classification Trees With the Pediatric Emergency Care Applied Research Network Head Trauma Decision Rules Importance: Computed tomographic (CT) scanning is the standard for the rapid diagnosis of intracranial injury, but it is costly and exposes patients to ionizing radiation. The Pediatric Emergency Care Applied Research Network (PECARN) rules for identifying children with minor head trauma who are at very low risk of clinically important traumatic brain injury (ciTBI) are widely used to triage CT imaging. Objective: To examine whether optimal classification trees (OCTs), which are novel machine-learning classifiers, improve on PECARN rules' predictive accuracy. Design, Setting, and Participants: A secondary analysis of prospective, publicly available data on emergency department visits for head trauma used by the PECARN group to develop their tool was conducted to derive OCT-based prediction rules for ciTBI in a development cohort and compare their predictive performance vs the PECARN rules in a validation cohort among children who were younger than 2 years and 2 years or older. Data on 42412 children with head trauma and without severely altered mental status who were examined between June 1, 2004, and September 30, 2006, were gathered from 25 emergency departments in North America participating in PECARN. Data analysis was conducted from September 15, 2016, to December 18, 2018. Main Outcomes and Measures: The outcome was ciTBI, with predictive performance measured by estimating the sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value, positive likelihood ratio, and negative likelihood ratio for the OCT and the PECARN rules. The OCT and PECARN rules' performance was compared by estimating ratios for each measure. Results: Of the 42412 children (15 996 [37.7%] girls) included in the analysis, 10718 were younger than 2 years (25.3%; mean [SD] age, 11.6 [0.6] months) and 31694 were 2 years or older (74.7%; age, 9.1 [4.9] years). Compared with PECARN rules, OCTs misclassified 0 vs 1 child with ciTBI in the younger and 10 vs 9 children with ciTBI in the older cohort, and correctly identified more children with very low risk of ciTBI in the younger (7605 vs 5701) and older (20 594 vs 18 134) cohorts. In the validation cohorts, compared with the PECARN rules, the OCTs had statistically significantly better specificity (in the younger cohort: 69.3%; 95% CI, 67.4%-71.2% vs 52.8%; 95% CI, 50.8%-54.9%; in the older cohort: 65.6%; 95% CI, 64.5%-66.8% vs 57.6%; 95% CI, 56.4%-58.8%), positive predictive value (odds ratios, 1.54; 95% CI, 1.36-1.74 and 1.23; 95% CI, 1.17-1.30, in younger and older children, respectively), and positive likelihood ratio (risk ratios, 1.54; 95% CI, 1.36-1.74 and 1.23; 95% CI, 1.17-1.30, in younger and older children, respectively). There were no statistically significant differences in the sensitivity, negative predictive value, and negative likelihood ratio between the 2 sets of rules. Conclusions and Relevance: If implemented, OCTs may help reduce the number of unnecessary CT scans, without missing more patients with ciTBI than the PECARN rules.",Excluded
1191,"Indwelling voice prosthesis insertion after total pharyngolaryngectomy with free jejunal reconstruction Objectives: Total pharyngolaryngectomy with free jejunal reconstruction is often performed in patients with hypopharyngeal carcinoma. However, postoperative speechlessness significantly decreases patient quality of life. We investigated whether Provox insertion could preserve speech after total pharyngolaryngectomy with free jejunal reconstruction. Study Design: Retrospective chart review. Method(s): A total of 130 cases of secondary Provox insertions after total pharyngolaryngectomy with free jejunal reconstruction were analyzed. Communication outcomes were compared using the Head and Neck Cancer Understandability of Speech Subscale. Outcomes and complications associated with insertion site (jejunal insertion vs. esophageal insertion) and adjuvant irradiation therapy were also evaluated. Result(s): Provox insertion had favorable communication outcomes in 102 cases (78.4%). Neither the insertion site nor irradiation affected the communication outcome. Complications were observed in 20 cases (15.4%). Local infection was the most common complication. Free jejunal insertion, in which the resection range was enlarged, had a lower complication rate than did esophageal insertion, and its complication rate was unaffected by previous irradiation. For all patients, the hospitalization duration and duration of speechlessness were 13.4 days and 14.6 months, respectively. Patients receiving jejunal insertions had a significantly shorter hospitalization duration than did those receiving esophageal insertions. Unlike Provox2, ProvoxVega significantly reduced the complication rate to zero. Conclusion(s): For jejunal inserson of a Provox prosthetic, a sufficient margin can be maintained during total pharyngolaryngectomy and irradiation can be performed, and satisfactory communication outcomes were observed. Provox insertion after total pharyngolaryngectomy with free jejunal reconstruction should be considered the standard therapy for voice restoration.

721,"Radiation-induced bystander effects in vivo are sex specific Ionizing radiation (IR) effects span beyond the area of direct exposure and can be observed in neighboring and distant naive cells and organs. This phenomenon is termed a 'bystander effect'. IR effects in directly exposed tissue in vivo are epigenetically mediated and distinct in males and females. Yet, IR-induced bystander effects have never been explored in a sex-specificity domain. We used an in vivo mouse model, whereby the bystander effects are studied in spleen of male and female animals subjected to head exposure when the rest of the body is protected by a medical-grade lead shield. We analyzed the induction of DNA damage and alterations in global DNA methylation. Molecular parameters were correlated with cellular proliferation and apoptosis levels. The changes observed in bystander organs are compared to the changes in unexposed animals and animals exposed to predicted and measured scatter doses. We have found the selective induction of DNA damage levels, global DNA methylation, cell proliferation and apoptosis in exposed and bystander spleen tissue of male and female mice. Sex differences were significantly diminished in animals subjected to a surgical removal of gonads. These data constitute the first evidence of sex differences in radiation-induced bystander effects in mouse spleen in vivo.

210,"Intracranial germ cell tumors: A singleinstitution experience BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Intracranial germ cell tumors (GCTs) are not a common disease. We reviewed the experience of a single institution to determine the variables that affect treatment outcome. DESIGN AND SETTING: A retrospective review of patients with the diagnosis of intracranial germ cell tumors treated in a single institution (KFSHRC) during the period from March 1985 to December 2007. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Fifty-seven patients with the diagnosis of intracranial GCT were recorded in the KFSHRC Tumor Registry during the period from 1985 to 2007. Seven patients with a pineal region tumor treated as germinomas in the earlier years without a tissue diagnosis were excluded. This retrospective study was restricted to the remaining 50 patients with a tissue or marker diagnosis: 31 germinomas and 19 non-germinomatous germ cell tumors (NGGCTs). RESULT(S): The 10-year overall survival (OS), event-free survival (EFS) and relapse-free survival (RFS) were 87%, 88% and 96% for patients with germinoma, with a median follow-up of 4.5 (range 2-17) years, compared with 26%, 29% and 46% for patients with NGGCT with a median follow-up of 3 (range 1.5-13) years. For NGGCT, variables favorably influencing OS were younger age (< 16 y vs >=16 y, P=.01), higher radiation dose (>50 Gy vs <=50 Gy; P=.03) and later year of diagnosis (>1990 vs <1990 P=.002). CONCLUSION(S): Tissue diagnosis of GCTs is mandatory prior to treatment except for patients with elevated markers. In germinoma, localized radiotherapy (RT) for M0 patients may be adequate. Long-term follow-up is needed to define the benefit of adding chemotherapy. For NGGCT, the use of combined modality treatment and RT dose >50 Gy are important factors that influence the outcome. Second-look surgery and resection of residual/ refractory tumors is always recommended.",Excluded

2142,"4DMRI-based investigation on the interplay effect for pencil beam scanning proton therapy of pancreatic cancer patients Background: Time-resolved volumetric magnetic resonance imaging (4DMRI) offers the potential to analyze 3D motion with high soft-tissue contrast without additional imaging dose. We use 4DMRI to investigate the interplay effect for pencil beam scanning (PBS) proton therapy of pancreatic cancer and to quantify the dependency of residual interplay effects on the number of treatment fractions. Method(s): Based on repeated 4DMRI datasets for nine pancreatic cancer patients, synthetic 4DCTs were generated by warping static 3DCTs with 4DMRI deformation vector fields. 4D dose calculations for scanned proton therapy were performed to quantify the interplay effect by CTV coverage (v95) and dose homogeneity (d5/d95) for incrementally up to 28 fractions. The interplay effect was further correlated to CTV motion characteristics. For quality assurance, volume and mass conservation were evaluated by Jacobian determinants and volume-density comparisons. Result(s): For the underlying patient cohort with CTV motion amplitudes < 15 mm, we observed significant correlations between CTV motion amplitudes and both the length of breathing cycles and the interplay effect. For individual fractions, tumor underdosage down to v95 = 70% was observed with pronounced dose heterogeneity (d5/d95 = 1.3). For full x 28 fractionated treatments, we observed a mitigation of the interplay effect with increasing fraction numbers. On average, after seven fractions, a CTV coverage with 95-107% of the prescribed dose was reached with sufficient dose homogeneity. For organs at risk, no significant differences were found between the static and accumulated dose plans for 28 fractions. Conclusion(s): Intrafractional organ motion exhibits a large interplay effect for PBS proton therapy of pancreatic cancer. The interplay effect correlates with CTV motion, but can be mitigated efficiently by fractionation, mainly due to different breathing starting phases in fractionated treatments. For hypofractionated treatments, a further restriction of motion may be required. Repeated 4DMRI measurements are a viable tool for pre- and post-treatment evaluations of the interplay effect.Copyright © 2019 The Author(s).",Excluded

The patients were divided into three groups: 51 patients had gross total resection and did not receive radiation therapy, 30 patients had subtotal resection and no radiation therapy, and 54 patients had subtotal resection followed by radiation therapy. The subtotal resection groups were similar in average age, male:female ratio, and tumor location, which allowed a valid comparison of the effects of irradiation. The recurrence rate in the total resection group was 4% (2 of 51 patients). Among patients in the subtotal resection groups, 60% of nonirradiated patients had a recurrence, compared with only 32% of the irradiated patients. The median time to recurrence was significantly longer in the irradiated group than in the nonirradiated group (125 vs. 66 months, P less than 0.05). There was no complication related to irradiation. These results provide convincing evidence that radiation therapy is beneficial in the treatment of partially resected meningiomas.",Included
3446,"Heterogeneity in the clastogenic response to X-rays in lymphocytes from ataxia-telangiectasia heterozygotes and controls A coded analysis of X-ray-induced chromatid aberrations in lymphocyte cultures from 45 control individuals and 19 ataxia-telangiectasia (A-T) heterozygotes was performed. The distribution of chromatid breaks induced in the late G2 portion of the cell cycle by 60 cGy of X-rays appeared bimodal in the study population. In six controls (13 percent) and in 12 of 19 (63 percent) A-T heterozygotes, the yields of X-ray-induced breaks observed were within the higher mode of the distribution. However, lymphocytes from A-T heterozygotes sensitive to the induction of chromatid breaks by 60 cGy did not contain increased numbers of aberrations following exposure to 20 cGy. The radio-resistant inhibition of DNA synthesis that occurs in A-T homozygotes was not observed in heterozygotes. Co-cultivation experiments showed an increased G2 delay in lymphocytes from an A-T heterozygote whose lymphocytes contained increased X-ray-induced chromatid breaks. The results show a significant association of A-T heterozygosity with G2 chromosomal sensitivity (P less than 0.001; Wilcoxon rank sum test). The measurement of X-ray-induced breaks, however, failed to identify 37 percent of A-T heterozygotes tested. The predicted prevalence of increased sensitivity to X-rays in controls is approximately three- to 30-fold greater than the estimated frequency of A-T heterozygotes in the general population. Therefore, although the increased sensitivity to X-ray-induced chromatid breaks appears to be associated with the A-T-gene, it is not a reliable indicator of A-T heterozygosity. Genetic or environmental factors other than the A-T gene also must be involved in the increased clastogenic response.",Included
114,"URINE COLLECTION AND MEASUREMENT ON SPACE SHUTTLE MISSION Emphasis in space medicine at this time is on understanding and controlling the physiological changes produced by exposure to weightlessness. Many physiological changes can be monitored by observing the changes in urine. However, the absence of gravity places special requirements on the method of collecting urine. For the Space Shuttle, a system was needed to measure the mass of individual urine voids and to collect a sample of each void. In addition, the system had to be compatable with male and female crewmembers. Finally, the system had to operate with minimal crew effort. A Urine Monitoring System (UMS) collects up to four 20 milliliter samples of each void and also records data for each void on magnetic tape. The samples and the tape are analyzed postflight.",Excluded

1023,"Allograft alone versus allograft with bone marrow concentrate for the healing of the instrumented posterolateral lumbar fusion Background context Spondylodesis in the operative management of lumbar spine diseases has been the subject of numerous studies over several decades. The posterolateral fusion (PLF) with pedicle screw fixation is a commonly used procedure. Purpose To determine whether the addition of bone marrow concentrate (BMC) to allograft bone increases fusion rate after instrumented posterior lumbar fusion. Study design The study was prospective, randomized, controlled, and blinded. Methods Eighty patients with degenerative disease of the lumbar spine underwent instrumented lumbar or lumbosacral PLF (22 men, 58 women; body mass index less than 35 for a good visualization of the PLF in the X-rays). In 40 cases, the PLF was done with spongious allograft chips alone (Group I, age 62.7 years in average, range 47-77 years, level of fusion 1-2). In another 40 cases, spongious allograft chips were mixed with BMC (Group II, age 58.5 years in average, range 42-80, level of fusion 1-3), including the mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs). Patients were scheduled for anteroposterior and lateral radiographs 12 and 24 months after the surgery and for computed tomography scanning 24 months after the surgery. Fusion status and the degree of mineralization of the fusion mass were evaluated separately by two radiologists blinded to patient group affiliation. The bony mass was judged as fused if there was uninterrupted bridging of well-mineralized bone between the transverse processes or sacrum, with trabeculation indicating bone maturation on least at one side of the spines. Results In Group I at 12 months, the bone graft mass was assessed in X-rays as fused in no cases (0%) and at 24 months in four cases (10%). In Group II, 6 cases (15%) achieved fusion at 12 months and 14 cases (35%) at 24 months. The statistically significant difference between both groups was proven for complete fusion at both 12 (p=.041) and 24 months (p=.011). Computed tomography scans showed that 16 cases (40%) in Group I and 32 cases (80%) in Group II had evidence of at least unilateral continuous bridging bone between neighboring vertebrae at 24 months (p<.05). Conclusions We have confirmed the hypothesis that the autologous BMC together with the allograft is a better alternative for PLF than the allograft alone. The use of autologous MSCs in form of BMC in combination with allograft is an effective option to enhance the PLF healing. © 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.",Excluded

All groups received a weekly dose for 4 weeks. Pain intensity was recorded using a 10-cm visual analogue scale; patients responded to the oral health impact profile (OHIP-14), xerostomia severity test and the hospital anxiety-depression scale (HAD). These assessments were performed at baseline, 2 and 4 weeks. LLLT decreased pain intensity and improved OHIP-14 scores significantly from baseline to 2 weeks in groups I and II compared with the placebo group. No statistically significant differences were found from 2 to 4 weeks. Overall improvements in visual analogue scale (VAS) scores from baseline to the end of treatment were as follows: Group I 15.7%; Group II 15.6%; Group III placebo 7.3%.

Flt3lg concentrations showed excellent dose discrimination at >= 1 Gy in the time window of 1 to 7 days after exposure except 1 Gy at day 7. Saa1 dose response was limited to the first two days after exposure. A multiplex assay with both proteins showed improved dose classification accuracy. Our magneto-nanosensor assay demonstrates the dose and time responses, low-dose sensitivity, small volume requirements, and rapid speed that have important advantages in radiation triage biodosimetry.",Included

The present results refer to cytogenetic assessments in a study cohort of the population of Dolon, a settlement located on the NE boundary of the nuclear weapon test site, which was exposed to elevated doses of ionising radiation primarily due to the first Soviet nuclear test in 1949. Conventional cytogenetic analyses were carried out on 21 blood samples from individuals (more than 50 years old) living in Dolon since the very beginning of nuclear testing. A matched control group included 20 individuals living in non-contaminated areas.

Continuous accelerated irradiation of 7-days per week is equal to accelerated fractionation with concomitant boost of 7 fractions in 5-days per week: Report on phase 3 clinical trial in head-and-neck cancer patients Purpose: To report long-term results of randomized trial comparing 2 accelerated fractionations of definitive radiation therapy assessing the need to irradiate during weekend in patients with head and neck squamous cell carcinoma. Methods and Materials: A total of 345 patients with SCC of the oral cavity, larynx, and oro- or hypo-pharynx, stage T2-4N0-1M0, were randomized to receive continuous accelerated irradiation (CAIR: once per day, 7 days per week) or concomitant accelerated boost (CB: once per day, 3 days per week, and twice per day, 2 days per week). Total dose ranged from 66.6-72 Gy, dose per fraction was 1.8 Gy, number of fractions ranged from 37-40 fractions, and overall treatment time ranged from 37-40 days. Result(s): No differences for all trial end-points were noted. At 5 and 10 years, the actuarial rates of local-regional control were 63% and 60% for CAIR vs 65% and 60% for CB, and the corresponding overall survival were 40% and 25% vs 44% and 25%, respectively. Confluent mucositis was the main acute toxicity, with an incidence of 89% in CAIR and 86% in CB patients. The 5-year rate of grade 3-4 late radiation morbidity was 6% for both regimens. Conclusion(s): Results of this trial indicate that the effects of accelerated fractionation can be achieve by delivering twice-per-day irradiation on weekday(s). This trial has also confirmed that an accelerated, 6-weeks schedule is a reasonable option for patients with intermediate-stage head-and-neck squamous cell carcinoma because of the associated high cure rate and minimal severe late toxicity. © 2013 Elsevier Inc.

213,"Clinicopathologic features as stronger prognostic factors than histology or grade in risk stratification of primary parotid malignancies BACKGROUND: The aim of this study, using a retrospective chart review as the primary study design, was to determine the relative contribution of clinicopathologic risk factors versus low- and high-risk grade histologic groups to assist management of primary parotid cancers.
METHODS: In all, 168 primary parotid malignancies were treated surgically at a tertiary care center from 1982 to 2005. Of these, 115 patients with complete follow-up information were further analyzed. Pathologic updating and reclassification in 28% of cases enabled comparison of tumor histology or grade with current consensus criteria. Clinical outcomes of high- and low-risk histology and grade were compared with the influence of traditional clinicopathologic risk factors.
RESULTS: Of 115 cases, the male:female ratio was equal and the median age was 63 years (range, 15 to 89 years). Mucoepidermoid carcinoma (n = 28) was the most common histology. The median follow-up was 44 months (range, 0–278 months). Of low-risk histology patients who underwent neck dissection 40% had pN+ disease. The median time to recurrence was not reached for low-risk tumors, compared with 29 months for high-risk tumors (p = .0001). Interestingly, extracapsular spread (ECS) and margin status were independent prognostic factors and conferred significantly greater prognostic value than histologic grade risk group. Disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS) at 5 years for the entire cohort were 51% and 57%, respectively. Risk group was a strong independent predictor of OS but not DFS.
CONCLUSIONS: Risk group defined by histology and grade was associated with DFS. ECS and margin status were independent predictors of DFS. Inclusion of ECS and margin status substantially improved the prediction of disease recurrence, supporting elective neck dissection and postoperative radiotherapy for high-grade tumors or low-risk histologies with positive margins or ECS.",Excluded
933,"Radiotherapy as therapeutic option for primary localised orbital lymphomas of low malignancy Purpose: The aim of this study was to assess the efficacy of radiotherapy as first line therapy for the treatment of primary localised orbital lymphomas of low malignancy (St IE) based on our cases.

1566,"Does tributyl phosphate influence the radiation risk of a highly proliferating system--the early mouse embryo in vitro? Two-cell mouse embryos were exposed in vitro to tributyl phosphate, x rays, or a combination of both. In-vitro development of the embryos was followed microscopically (cleavage to four- and eight-cell embryos, formation of morulae and blastocysts, and hatching of blastocysts). Effects on proliferation were estimated by counting the number of cells per embryo early (48 h p.c. = 48 hours post conceptionem) and late (144 h p.c.) in the preimplantation period. Cytogenetic damage was studied using micronucleus formation as the end point. Tributyl phosphate did not reveal toxic effects up to a concentration of about 5 microM after an exposure time of 18 h. At a concentration of about 15 microM, 50% of late preimplantation embryos showed effects on morphological development and on cell proliferation, and at about 40 microM, 90% of the embryos were affected. Tributyl phosphate did not induce micronuclei. Small effects by x irradiation were observed between 0.25 Gy and 0.5 Gy, depending on the end point measured in the late preimplantation stage. Fifty percent of the embryos were affected by a dose slightly higher than 1 Gy, and 90% after about 4 Gy.

Early (within 6 months) and late radiological injuries were evaluated according to Ikezoe and Koening, respectively. The correlation between CT findings and patient characteristics was evaluated., RESULTS: Radiographic injury in periods 1 and 2 was: (1) diffuse consolidation 3 and 27%, (2) patchy consolidation and ground-glass opacity (GGO) 13.2 and 33%, (3) diffuse GGO 13.2 and 21%, (4) patchy GGO 16.2 and 6%, and (5) no findings 54.4 and 21%, respectively. Late injury in periods 3 and 4 were: (1) modified conventional pattern (consolidation, volume loss, bronchiectasis) 54 and 44%, (2) mass-like 20 and 28%, (3) scar-like 14 and 16% and (4) no findings 20 and 12%, respectively. The proportion of emphysema grades 2-4 was significantly higher in patients who had no radiological findings 6 weeks after treatment (p=0.021). Both patchy consolidation and GGO patterns resulted more frequently in patients who were not administered steroids (p=0.035). No relationship was found with smoking, tumor dimension and radiation dose., CONCLUSIONS: The majority of patients had no evidence of radiographic lung injury 6 weeks after SBRT; the most prevalent findings were diffuse or patchy GGO. Patchy and diffuse consolidation develops 2-6 months after SBRT. Modified conventional pattern was the most prevalent in the late periods. Copyright 2009 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

1944,"Downregulation of MicroRNA-330 Correlates with the Radiation Sensitivity and Prognosis of Patients with Brain Metastasis from Lung Cancer BACKGROUND: The present study sought to explore the role of microRNA-330 (miR-330) in predicting the radiation response and prognosis of patients with brain metastasis (BM) from lung cancer (LC)., METHODS: Patients with BM from LC were identified and classified into radiation-sensitive and radiation-resistant groups according to the overall survival rate, local and distant recurrence rate after conventional whole-brain radiation therapy. Quantitative realtime polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) was used to detect miR-330 expression in serum. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were used to evaluate the prognostic value of miR-330 for the radiation sensitivity of brain metastasis from LC. Related clinical factors for radiation sensitivity were assessed by logistic regression analysis, and a survival analysis was conducted using COX regression and the Kaplan-Meier method., RESULTS: MiR-330 exhibited lower expression in the radiation-sensitive group than in the radiation-resistant group. The area under the ROC curve of miR-330 for predicting radiation sensitivity was 0.898 (optimal cut-off value, 0.815), with a sensitivity of 71.7% and a specificity of 90.1%. After radiation therapy, patients with low miR-330 expression, compared to patients with high miR-330 expression, displayed a lower survival rate and a median survival time. MiR-330 expression was correlated with extracranial metastasis, maximum BM diameter, tumor-node-metastasis (TNM) stage and node (N) stage. Logistic regression and COX regression analyses revealed that extracranial metastasis, TNM stage, N stage and miR-330 expression were factors that influenced both radiation sensitivity and individual prognostic factors in patients with BM from LC., CONCLUSIONS: These findings indicate that the downregulation of miR-330 correlates with radiation sensitivity and poor prognosis in patients with BM from LC.

2646,"Use of supero-temporal free conjunctivo-limbal autograft in the surgical management of pterygium: our technique and results A pterygium is a fibro-vascular, wing shaped encroachment of the conjunctiva on to the cornea. The prevalence rates ranges from 0.7 to 31% among different populations and also influenced by age, race, and exposure to solar radiations. Ultraviolet light-induced damage to the limbal stem cell barrier with subsequent conjunctivalisation of the cornea is the currently accepted aetiology of this condition. Indication of surgery include visual impairment, cosmetic disfigurement, motility restriction, recurrent inflammation and interference with contact lens wear. This Study was conducted to know the safety, efficacy and success with supero-temporal free conjunctivo-limbal auto graft transplantation in the surgical management of pterygium. Prospective case series where supero temporal free conjunctivo-limbal auto grafting was performed on 72 eyes of 72 patients with vascular progressive pterygia. Pterygium recurrence was considered a surgical failure. Recurrence was defined as fibro vascular tissue crossing the corneo-scleral limbus on to the clear cornea in the area of previous pterygium excision before 6 months. Recurrence of pterygium was noted in three out of 72 eyes (4.16%), after a minimum follow up of 12 months to maximum of 25 months (Mean 14.6 months). No major intra-operative or postoperative complications were encountered. Supero temporal free conjunctivo-limbal auto graft appears to be a safe and effective technique in the surgical management of pterygium. The inclusion of limbal tissue in the conjunctival auto graft following pterygium excision appears to be essential to ensure low recurrence rate.",Excluded

The dose delivered was 45 Gy (1.80 Gy per fraction) in IMRT technique. Concurrent 5-fluorouracil-based chemotherapy at 225 mg/m(2) was administered as a continuous intravenous infusion. Primary endpoints were acute gastrointestinal toxicity (CTC 4.0) and technical feasibility of IMRT in regard to dose planning and radiation delivery., RESULTS: Early acute events were defined as clinical and chemical adverse effects of IMRT and concurrent chemotherapy during treatment. By definition, 90 days after the end of IMRT has been evaluated as acute-phase toxicity. No patient had grade 4 or higher acute adverse events. Clinical grade 3 toxicity occurred in two patients (8%) with diarrhea and in one case (4%) with nausea. Hematological changes with grade 3 occurred in three cases (12%) with hemoglobin decrease, in five cases (25%) as leukopenia, and in one case (4%) with thrombocytopenia. The mean dose for liver was 16 Gy and the percentage volume exceeding 30 Gy (V30) was 21%. Mean dose for right and left kidney was 9 and 13 Gy, respectively, and V20 was 9% and 13%, respectively. Heart received a median dose of 15 Gy and V40 was 17%. The mean dose to the bowel was 11 Gy and V40 was 6%. Spinal cord had at maximum 33 Gy in median. Specifics of dose distribution, including the coverage, for the target region were as follows: minimum was 33 Gy, maximum 48.6 Gy, and mean dose 44.6 Gy. The prescribed dose (45 Gy) covered 99% and 95% of planning target volume (OTV) in 66% and 92% of cases, respectively. Median PTV was 15.77 ml (range, 805-3,604 ml)., CONCLUSIONS: The data support the practical feasibility of IMRT in adjuvant treatment in high-risk gastric cancer in the postoperative setting as a proof of principle. Acute toxicity has been tolerable.",Excluded
1467,"Chernobyl birds have smaller brains BACKGROUND: Animals living in areas contaminated by radioactive material from Chernobyl suffer from increased oxidative stress and low levels of antioxidants. Therefore, normal development of the nervous system is jeopardized as reflected by high frequencies of developmental errors, reduced brain size and impaired cognitive abilities in humans. Alternatively, associations between psychological effects and radiation have been attributed to post-traumatic stress in humans., METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDING: Here we used an extensive sample of 550 birds belonging to 48 species to test the prediction that even in the absence of post-traumatic stress, there is a negative association between relative brain size and level of background radiation. We found a negative association between brain size as reflected by external head volume and level of background radiation, independent of structural body size and body mass. The observed reduction in brain size in relation to background radiation amounted to 5% across the range of almost a factor 5,000 in radiation level. Species differed significantly in reduction in brain size with increasing background radiation, and brain size was the only morphological character that showed a negative relationship with radiation. Brain size was significantly smaller in yearlings than in older individuals., CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Low dose radiation can have significant effects on normal brain development as reflected by brain size and therefore potentially cognitive ability. The fact that brain size was smaller in yearlings than in older individuals implies that there was significant directional selection on brain size with individuals with larger brains experiencing a viability advantage.",Included

Confidence in medical evaluations with increasing levels of laboratory testing and imaging was rated on a 100-point visual analog scale. Knowledge of radiation exposure was ascertained when participants compared the radiation dose of one abdomen-pelvis CT with 2-view chest radiography. To assess cancer risk knowledge, participants rated their agreement with these factual statements: Approximately 2 to 3 abdominal CTs give the same radiation exposure as experienced by Hiroshima survivors"" and ""2 to 3 abdominal CTs over a person's lifetime can increase cancer risk."" Previous CT was also assessed., RESULTS: There were 1,168 participants, 67% women and mean age 40.7 years (SD 15.9 years). Median confidence in a medical evaluation without ancillary testing was 20 (95% confidence interval [CI] 16 to 25) compared with 90 (95% CI 88 to 91) when laboratory testing and CT were included. More than 70% of participants underestimated the radiation dose of CT relative to chest radiography, and cancer risk comprehension was poor. Median agreement with the Hiroshima statement was 13 (95% CI 10 to 16) and 45 (95% CI 40 to 45) with the increased lifetime cancer risk statement. Seven hundred ninety-five patients reported receiving a previous CT. Of 365 patients who reported no previous CT, 142 (39%) had one documented in our electronic medical record., CONCLUSION: Patients are more confident when CT imaging is part of their medical evaluation but have a poor understanding of the concomitant radiation exposure and risk and underestimate their previous imaging experience.

Its pathogenesis remains unclear even if the initial injury likely occurs in the endothelial cells of central veins. The aim of our study was to investigate liver morphological features in relation to alpha-isoform of smooth muscle actin expression in hepatic stellate cells in six patients treated by localized radiotherapy on the biliopancreatic area. Within the month after completion of treatment, an activation of hepatic stellate cells strictly confined to irradiated areas and coinciding with congestive changes was observed. At a later stage, collagen deposition gradually increased, replacing the congestive and destroyed areas. This new fibrotic tissue also contained numerous alpha-smooth muscle positive cells. Our data suggest that early hepatic stellate cells activation coinciding with congestive changes plays an important role in radiation liver injury and ensuing fibrosis.",Included

Forty-one patients with head and neck cancer were treated with surgery, irradiation, and free tissue transfer for reconstruction from 1977 to 1987. The age range was 38 to 78 years with a median age of 61. Patients were staged using the AJCC (1978) staging system. Eighty-four percent of the patients were in stage III or IV. The common sites of primary tumors were the oral cavity (22) and oropharynx (10). Forty patients had squamous cell carcinoma and 1 patient had basal cell carcinoma. Six patients had preoperative irradiation, and the rest had postoperative irradiation. The most common surgical procedures were partial glossectomy and neck dissection (17 patients) and wide excision of the primary and neck dissection (17 patients). The most common types of free tissue transfer were dorsalis pedis (13 patients) and scapular flaps (6 patients). The primary site was controlled in 22 patients (54%) and the neck in 36 patients (88%). Three patients (7.3%) had flap failure which required further surgical management. Eighteen patients are living with no evidence of disease with a median follow-up of 18 months (5-101 months), 10 patients are living with disease with a median follow-up of 9 months (3-40 months), 9 patients are dead of disease with a median survival of 13 months (6-54 months), and 4 patients are lost for follow-up.

These methods have permitted evaluation of the efficacy of protectors, such as sulforaphane from crucifers, that defend cells through induction of cytoprotective (phase 2) genes., METHODS: Spots on the back were precisely located by opaque, adhesive, vinyl templates provided with 16 circular, 2.0 cm diameter occludable windows. Doses (100-800 mJ/cm(2)) of narrow-band (311 nm) UVR were administered, and the erythema index (a(*)) was measured with a chromometer on treated and control areas, before and after radiation., RESULTS: Daily variations in basal a(*) values of each spot were much smaller than the differences of a(*) values among spots of one individual, or those of corresponding spots among different individuals. The increments in erythema responses to UVR (Delta a(*)) were similar despite large variations of basal a(*) of spots. The most appropriate measure of UVR-evoked erythema is therefore the Delta a(*) value for each spot, which is an independent observational entity. Delta a(*) was proportional to UVR dose, and independent of spot location. To evaluate effectiveness of protectors against UVR damage we paired horizontally adjacent spots for treatment and controls. Vertical or random spot pairing did not provide significantly higher consistency. Protective efficacy against UVR erythema is appropriately expressed as percent reduction in Delta a(*) values upon treatment with inducers., CONCLUSIONS: The protection of skin against UVR damage can be quantified precisely from changes in erythema index (Delta a(*)) obtained with a chromometer.",Excluded
225,"Changes in X-ray sensitivity of mouse eggs from fertilization to the early pronuclear stage, and their repair capacity To study the changes in radiosensitivity of male and female genomes from fertilization to the pronuclear stage, the frequency of induced chromosome aberrations was examined at the first-cleavage metaphase in eggs fertilized with X-irradiated sperm, in eggs X-irradiated at the mature oocyte stage immediately before fertilization, and in fertilized eggs exposed to X-rays at various stages before DNA synthesis (1-5 h after insemination). Gametic treatment, fertilization and embryo culture were carried out in vitro. Most of the induced chromosome aberrations were chromosome-type aberrations, the frequency of chromosome fragments being the highest, followed by chromosome exchanges in both sperm and oocytes. The induction of chromosome-type aberrations was much higher in oocytes than in sperm. Chromosome-type aberrations were the main type also in fertilized eggs irradiated at the pre-DNA-synthetic stage. The radiosensitivity increased gradually with pronuclear formation (1-4h after insemination), but little difference in radiosensitivity was observed between eggs irradiated at 4 h and 5 h, corresponding to the stage when pronuclear formation was complete. The drastic change with pronuclear formation was found not only in radiosensitivity but also in the frequency of chromosome aberrations. The frequency of chromosome-type exchanges decreased drastically 2 h after insemination, and exchanges were barely observed at 5 h. The difference in radiosensitivity between male and female genomes also markedly changed with pronuclear formation, the chromosome aberration induction in the female genome being much higher than that in the male genome before accomplishment of pronuclear formation. The analysis of potentiation effects of 3-aminobenzamide and caffeine on the yield of X-ray-induced chromosome aberrations demonstrated that the increase of radiosensitivity and the decrease of chromosome-type exchange induction with pronuclear formation, may be closely correlated with alterations in chromatin configuration in the pronuclei and in repair capacity of fertilized eggs at the pre-DNA-synthetic stage. No evidence based on repair efficiency was found for the marked difference in radiosensitivity between male and female genomes during pronuclear formation.",Excluded
879,"Radiation exposure in total ankle replacement BACKGROUND: Radiation exposure from diagnostic imaging procedures is associated with increased cancer risk. No published data currently exist regarding ionizing radiation exposure in total ankle replacement surgery. This study quantified intraoperative fluoroscopic dose and duration during ankle replacement surgery and examined patient and technical factors affecting the level of exposure., METHODS: Fifty-five patients underwent ankle replacement using STAR, Salto-Talaris, or INBONE total ankles. Intraoperative fluoroscopic dose and duration, patient demographics, implant design, and accompanying additional procedures were documented for each case. The relationship between each relevant variable and radiation dose and time was determined., RESULTS: The mean fluoroscopic dose and duration for all cases were 1.15 +/- 0.84 milliGray per case and 77 +/- 34 seconds per case, respectively. There was a positive correlation between the absorbed radiation dose and the duration of fluoroscopy (r = .50, P < .001). The mean fluoroscopic doses were 1.53 milliGray, 0.99 milliGray, and 0.88 milliGray for INBONE, STAR, and Salto-Talaris prostheses, respectively. Fluoroscopic dose was significantly influenced by implant design (P = .035), with implants using an intramedullary referencing guide associated with higher radiation doses. After excluding cases requiring additional procedures, the fluoroscopic time and radiation dose associated with intramedullary referencing guide implants continued to exceed those of the other implants, but the differences were no longer statistically significant (P = .22, P = .09, respectively)., CONCLUSION: The average patient radiation dose during total ankle replacement was approximately one-fifth the recommended maximum yearly radiation exposure. The radiation dose was positively associated with fluoroscopy duration. Among factors controllable by the surgeon, selection of an implant with an extramedullary alignment system and conscious effort to minimize duration of fluoroscopy can reduce harmful radiation exposure and decrease cancer risk in total ankle replacement patients and associated operating room personnel., LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Level III, comparative series.

Dreyfuss, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, 76: 5910-5913, 1979), the tumor incidence was increased following irradiation (150 rads, 5 times, at weekly intervals), from 22 to 93% in females and from 5 to 59% in males. Experiments here reported suggest that 2 consecutive total-body gamma-irradiations of 150 rads each are sufficient to induce in rats the development of tumors, some malignant; 18 of 19 females (94.7%) developed tumors at an average age of 11.4 mo, and seven of the 14 males in this group (50%) developed tumors at an average age of 10.4 mo. In the second group, which received 3 consecutive gamma-irradiations, 20 of 23 females (86.9%) and 5 of 13 males (38.4%) developed tumors at average ages of 9.1 and 7.5 mo, respectively. In the third group, among rats which received 4 consecutive gamma-irradiations, 17 of 19 females (89.4%) and 4 of 12 males (33.3%) developed tumors at average ages of 9.4 and 10.5 mo, respectively. The etiology of tumors either developing spontaneously or induced by irradiation in rats remains to be clarified. Our attempts to detect virus particles by electron microscopy in such tumors or lymphomas have not been successful. As a working hypothesis, we are tempted to theorize that tumors or lymphomas developing spontaneously or induced by gamma irradiation in rats are caused by latent viral agents which are integrated into the cell genome and are cell associated, i.e., not separable from the rat tumor cells by conventional methods thus far used.",Included

537,"Adjuvant radiotherapy for low-risk early breast cancer in elderly women: Evidence from randomized trials Breast cancer is the most common cancer pathology in women in the Western world. The median age at diagnosis is 60 years and in the coming decades it is estimated that the number of elderly women affected reaches an important percentage. This aging of the cancer population, associated with its inherent comorbidities and aggravated by the lack of consensus about the most appropriate treatment, make it difficult to administer an effective postoperative treatment in elderly women with a low-risk profile. An exhaustive geriatric evaluation is a sine qua non condition to opt for a specific type of treatment. To date, several options are available such as endocrine therapy (ET) alone, moderate/high hypofractionation and various accelerated partial breast irradiation (APBI) techniques.

Methods Of 48 consecutively treated patients with neoadjuvant CRT, we selected 20 EAC ypN0 patients (group 1). These patients were matched with 20 pN0 EAC patients who had surgery alone (group 2). Harvested (y)pN0 lymph nodes were examined immunohistochemically (anti-CK8/18 [CAM 5.2]) according to a validated sentinel node protocol. A 3rd group (n = 11) staged as ypN1 after neoadjuvant CRT was used as the control group. Results Upstaging to NMM+ occurred in 2 patients (10%) in group 1 and in 8 patients (40%) in group 2 (P =.028). Disease-free and overall survival rates in NMM+ patients in group 1 were worse compared with NMM- patients (P =.014 and P =.003, respectively) but comparable with ypN1 patients (n = 11). Conclusions A 30% reduction of NMM+ was obtained after neoadjuvant treatment in (y)pN0 patients. NMM+ after CRT had a negative impact on survival in ypN1 patients.

2592,"Physician decision making and trends in the use of cardiac stress testing in the United States: An analysis of repeated cross-sectional data Background: Cardiac stress testing, particularly with imaging, has been the focus of debates about rising health care costs, inappropriate use, and patient safety in the context of radiation exposure., Objective: To determine whether U.S. trends in cardiac stress test use may be attributable to population shifts in demographics, risk factors, and provider characteristics and evaluate whether racial/ ethnic disparities exist in physician decision making., Design: Analyses of repeated cross-sectional data., Setting: National Ambulatory Medical Care Survey and National Hospital Ambulatory Medical Care Survey (1993 to 2010)., Patients: Adults without coronary heart disease., Measurements: Cardiac stress test referrals and inappropriate use., Results: Between 1993 to 1995 and 2008 to 2010, the annual number of U.S. ambulatory visits in which a cardiac stress test was ordered or performed increased from 28 per 10 000 visits to 45 per 10 000 visits. No trend was found toward more frequent testing after adjustment for patient characteristics, risk factors, and provider characteristics (P-0.134). Cardiac stress tests with imaging comprised a growing portion of all tests, increasing from 59% in 1993 to 1995 to 87% in 2008 to 2010. At least 34.6% were probably inappropriate, with associated annual costs and harms of 501 million and 491 future cases of cancer.

1719,"Alternative means of estimating maximum permissible activity of I-131 administered to treat thyroid cancer Objectives Maximum permissible activity (MPA) of I-131 to be administered to treat thyroid cancer traditionally combines 2 dose components & requires 5 days of repeatedly measuring whole body gamma radiation with an Anger camera & blood processing. The objective of our study was to determine whether the 2 dose components are sufficiently well correlated to enable estimating total dose from blood work alone. Methods Data were examined retrospectively for all pts studied from 2004 - 2015. An uncollimated gamma camera measured anterior & posterior counts (corrected for background & decay & calibrated by I-131 standards) 6 times over 5 days after administration of 37-74 MBq I-131 to estimate dose to blood from gamma emissions (Dgamma). Blood was sampled within 10 min of each camera measurement, well counter counts of which estimated dose to blood from beta emissions (Dbeta). Adding these 2 estimates provided total dose (DT) to blood forming organs, adjusted for body habitus. Predicted total dose (DP) was obtained from Dbeta alone by linear regression. Conventional MPA was computed as 200 rad/DT & predicted MPA as 200 rad/DP. Results There were 62 pts (age = 61+/-12 yrs; 30 female; 32 male), of whom 2 were studied twice & 3 were studied 3 times, for a total of 68 measurements. DT was progressively larger for pts studied multiple times (rank correlation rho = 0.39, p = 0.004). DP was computed as = -0.005+1.473* Dbeta, & correlated strongly with DT (r = 0.98, p < 0.0001; intercept = 0.04+/-0.02, p = 0.09; slope = 0.95+/-0.02, p < 0.0001), with similar means (0.76+/-0.51 versus 0.76+/-0.52 rad/mCi, paired t-test p = 0.96). Predicted & conventional total doses were similar for pts studied once (0.69+/-0.41 versus 0.68+/-0.42 rad/mCi, p = 0.72), twice (1.06+/-0.69 versus 1.11+/-0.64 rad/mCi, p = 0.39), & 3 times (1.25+/-0.59 versus 1.26+/-0.62 rad/mCi, p = 0.87). Predicted MPA correlated strongly with actual MPA (r = 0.99, p < 0.0001), with similar means (385+/-230 versus 394+/-244 mCi, p = 0.11).

1836,"Effectiveness of Nd: YAG laser therapy on Japanese cedar pollinosis Many have reported on the effectiveness of laser surgery therapy for perennial allergic rhinitis. However, the suppressive effects of laser irradiation on allergic rhinitis and its symptoms have not been reported in patients with pollinosis. This is because therapeutic effects on pollinosis are difficult to evaluate. The amount of pollen in the air varies during the year, and from year to year. Also, allergic symptoms develop due to exposure to the amount of pollen which is markedly influenced by the weather. In this study, the severity of allergic symptoms in the pollen season was compared between patients treated with early medication, non-treated patients and patients treated with preseasonal contact Nd: YAG laser surgery. Results suggests that laser surgery was effective in reducing the severity of symptoms in patients with cedar pollinosis. Symptoms were milder in the laser group than in the medication group and non-treated group for 3-4 weeks after the start of seasonal pollinosis, although no differences were noted in the early weeks. This may be explained by the fact that laser irradiation reduces the lamina propria of the nasal mucosa, the site of allergic reactions. This also suggests that allergic pollen can't penetrate the mucosal surface which shows squamous epithelization after laser irradiation.",Excluded
3,"New radiosensitization treatment (KORTUC-SC) for chemo-resistant supra-clavicular lymph nodes metastasis Purpose/Objective: Linear accelerator-based radiotherapy has little effect on most of locally-advanced neoplasmas that have grown to several centimeters or more. Such tumors contain numerous hypoxic cancer cells and/or large amounts of anti-oxidative enzymes, and are therefore resistant to low linear energy transfer (LET) radiation such as X-rays and electrons from linear accelerators (Linac). We have developed a new radiosensitizer containing hydrogen peroxide & sodium hyaluronate for topical tumor injection for various types of tumors which are not superficially exposed, and the method was named 'KORTUC II'. Safety and effectiveness of the method have already been successfully performed by our clinical trials for patients with unresectable and/or recurrent neoplasms. This study aimed to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of KORTUC II specifically for patients with chemotherapy-resistant supra-clavicular lymph nodes metastasis, and the method was named as KORTUC-SC (KORTUC for supra-clavicular lymph nodes metastasis). For these lesions, curative resection is impossible because of the direct invasion of neoplasms to surrounding cervical great vessels. Therefore new strategies for better local control have been needed. Material(s) and Method(s): This study was performed at Kochi Medical School Hospital between September 2006 and March 2010. Twelve patients (2 men,10 women) with chemotherapy-resistant supraclavicular lymph node metastasis were enrolled into the study after providing fully informed written consent. All the patients underwent PET-CT examinations prior to and at 3 ~ 6 months after KORTUC-SC. We compared these two examination results. Patients were 58 to 77 years old (average age was 65).The radiotherapy regimen was 4 Gy/time, 3 times/week, for 4 weeks, and total dose was 48 Gy. The appropriate energy level of electron beams was selected for individual patients in terms of depth of the target lesion. The injection of 3 to 6 ml of the agent was started from the 5th session of radiotherapy, and was performed twice a week under ultrasonographic guidance. Result(s): The numbers of the patients were 12. Therapeutic effects were evaluated by the FDG-PET performed prior to and following the KORTUC-SC treatment. Treatment was well tolerated, with minimal adverse effects. Of the 12 patients, 6 (50%) showed complete response (CR), 1 (8.3%) showed partial response (PR), 3 (25%) showed stable disease(SD), and another 2 (16.6%) showed progressive disease (PD). Overall survival rate was 83% at 1 year (10/12 patients) and 75% at 2 years (9/12 patients). The mean duration of follow-up at the end of February 2011 was 35.1 months. Conclusion(s): Based on the findings of FDG-PET study, remarkable therapeutic effects of the KORTUC II treatment for chemotherapyresistant supra-clavicular lymph nodes metastasis (KORTUC-SC) were clearly identified. The treatment was well tolerated, with minimal adverse effects such as local pain at the injection site. The treatment outcomes were satisfactory and the adverse events were within the permissible range. This therapy is much less expensive than molecular-targeted therapies in current use, such as Cetuximab. Some well designed prospective randomized clinical trials are needed to confirm the therapeutic efficacy of KORTUC-SC.",Excluded
2325,"Patient-reported versus physiologic swallowing outcomes in patients with head and neck cancer after chemoradiation Objective: The primary objective of this project was to retrospectively investigate the relationship between patient-reported and physiologic swallowing measures after chemoradiation therapy for head neck cancer (HNC). Method(s): Adult patients who underwent chemoradiation therapy for HNC and presented for videofluoroscopic swallow study were reviewed retrospectively. Surgically treated patients were excluded. Patient perception of swallowing-related outcomes was assessed via the MD Anderson Dysphagia Inventory (MDADI) on the same day that physiologic measures of swallow function were obtained. Using vidoefluoroscopic data, the Dynamic Imaging Grade of Swallowing Toxicity (DIGEST) scale yielded measures of safety (DIGEST-S: penetration/aspiration) and efficiency (DIGEST-E: residue). Statistical analysis for correlation coefficients was performed. Result(s): Thirty patients met the inclusion criteria. The oropharynx was the most commonly affected site (70.0%), followed by the larynx (16.7%). The median radiation dose was 72 grays (Gy), and participants were assessed a mean of 4.6 (range 0-12) years following completion of treatment. There was no correlation between the MDADI and the DIGEST-E score (Pearson rho = -0.045, P = 0.812), DIGEST-S score (Pearson rho = 0.075, P = 0.695), or summary DIGEST grade (Pearson rho = 0.046, P = 0.810). MDADI scores did not change significantly with increasing time since radiation (P = 0.375), whereas the DIGEST-E scores, DIGEST-S score, and summary DIGEST grades worsened over time (P = 0.007, P = 0.002, and P = 0.0005, respectively). Conclusion(s): Assessment of swallowing physiology showed that function worsened after chemoradiation therapy, but this did not correlate with patient-reported quality-of-life measures. Reduced patient awareness of swallow dysfunction years after completion of chemoradiation has implications for management of dysphagia in the face of physiologic decline. Level of Evidence: 4.

579,"Selecting the best noninvasive imaging test to guide treatment after an inconclusive exercise test Opinion statement: The first step towards approaching a patient with an inconclusive stress test is to identify the initial reason why a stress test was ordered and examine what factors led to inconclusive test results. Next, it is important to ask whether the patient will benefit from further testing, as not all patients with inconclusive test results require additional testing. In patients who are at low-to-intermediate risk, it may be useful to perform coronary CT angiography (CTA) to exclude the presence of obstructive coronary atherosclerosis. Among individuals with no prior history of coronary artery disease, a possible advantage of CTA is that if subclinical atherosclerosis is identified, intensification of lifestyle interventions, and often pharmacotherapy, should be advocated. On the other hand, in high-risk patients or individuals that already have coronary artery disease, the primary objective is to quantify the presence and magnitude of ischemia in order to define the potential role of coronary revascularization procedures. This can be achieved by myocardial perfusion imaging using nuclear imaging or cardiac MRI. Alternatively, a functional evaluation to identify stress-induced wall motion abnormalities using stress echocardiography or MRI can be obtained. In selecting which test to obtain, it is important to understand the strengths and limitations of different imaging tests and to consider patient factors (e.g., body habitus) that may influence the accuracy of various tests. In addition, physicians should consider whether there are any other clinical questions that require imaging. For instance, cardiac MRI may be used to evaluate for infiltrative myocardial disease or pericardial disease whereas cardiac CT can evaluate for lung pathology or diseases of the aorta. Finally, any decision regarding what type of additional testing to obtain should also be based on knowing the local expertise and availability of various testing options. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.",Excluded
30,"Evaluation of a transparent perfluorodecalin-infused patch as an adjunct to laser-assisted tattoo removal: A pivotal trial BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Laser-assisted treatment of tattoos is well recognized to produce opaque epidermal whitening that prevents multiple sequential passes during a single treatment session. The amount of epidermal whitening produced in association with the procedure can be minimized by topical application of perfluorodecalin (PFD), which is an optical clearing agent. This pivotal trial assessed the ability of a transparent PFD-infused patch used in conjunction with a Q-switched nanosecond laser in the treatment of tattoos to permit multiple laser passes during a single 5 minute treatment session in comparison to the number of passes that could be completed using conventional treatment of the tattoo with the laser alone., STUDY DESIGN: Thirty subjects (mean age 37 years; 14 males) with predominantly dark blue or black tattoos were enrolled in a split-tattoo trial. One half of each tattoo was treated conventionally, whereas the other half was treated through the PFD patch. Treatments were performed using a nanosecond Q-switched 755-nm Alexandrite laser. The number of treatments performed in a 5-minute time period was quantified for each side of the tattoo (primary effectiveness outcome). Patient-reported pain scores and adverse events (AEs) were also evaluated., RESULTS: Significantly more laser passes could be made on average using the PFD patch compared with treatment using the laser alone (3.7 passes vs. 1.4 passes; P < 0.001). AEs were limited to those expected during laser removal of tattoos. The proportions of subjects with transient edema and erythema were lower in the PFD patch treatment group (36.7% vs. 63.3% and 33.3% vs. 70.0%, respectively); all AEs were transient and resolved quickly. No patient in either group exhibited dyschromia (hypo- or hyperpigmentation) in the treatment area at the 1-month post treatment visit. Additionally, when surveyed at the 1-month follow-up visit, all subjects (30/30) preferred to continue laser-assisted tattoo removal with the PFD patch., CONCLUSION: An average of 3.7 laser passes were made in a defined 5-minute treatment session when using the transparent PFD-infused patch, which is significantly more than was possible with the laser alone (average of 1.4 passes). Use of the PFD patch was associated with improved tolerability compared with conventional treatment, with subjects experiencing fewer and less severe AEs related to epidermal injury. Lasers Surg.

1860,"Genomic characterization of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) in radiation-exposed Chornobyl cleanup workers Background: Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) was the predominant leukemia in a recent study of Chornobyl cleanup workers from Ukraine exposed to radiation (UR-CLL). Radiation risks of CLL significantly increased with increasing bone marrow radiation doses. Current analysis aimed to clarify whether the increased risks were due to radiation or to genetic mutations in the Ukrainian population. Method(s): A detailed characterization of the genomic landscape was performed in a unique sample of 16 UR-CLL patients and age- and sex-matched unexposed general population Ukrainian-CLL (UN-CLL) and Western-CLL (W-CLL) patients (n = 28 and 100, respectively). Result(s): Mutations in telomere-maintenance pathway genes POT1 and ATM were more frequent in UR-CLL compared to UN-CLL and W-CLL (both p < 0.05). No significant enrichment in copy-number abnormalities at del13q14, del11q, del17p or trisomy12 was identified in UR-CLL compared to other groups. Type of work performed in the Chornobyl zone, age at exposure and at diagnosis, calendar time, and Rai stage were significant predictors of total genetic lesions (all p < 0.05). Tumor telomere length was significantly longer in UR-CLL than in UN-CLL (p = 0.009) and was associated with the POT1 mutation and survival. Conclusion(s): No significant enrichment in copy-number abnormalities at CLL-associated genes was identified in UR-CLL compared to other groups. The novel associations between radiation exposure, telomere maintenance and CLL prognosis identified in this unique case series provide suggestive, though limited data and merit further investigation.Copyright © 2018 The Author(s).",Excluded

Most experimental animal studies for assessing the biological effects of charged particles have involved acute dose delivery for single ions and/or fractionated exposure protocols. Here, we assessed the behavioral and cognitive performance of female and male C57BL/6J x DBA2/J F1 (B6D2F1) mice 2 months following rapidly delivered, sequential irradiation with protons (1 GeV, 60%), 16O (250 MeV/n, 20%), and 28Si (263 MeV/n, 20%) at 0, 25, 50, or 200 cGy at 4-6 months of age. Cortical BDNF, CD68, and MAP-2 levels were analyzed 3 months after irradiation or sham irradiation. During the dark period, male mice irradiated with 50 cGy showed higher activity levels in the home cage than sham-irradiated mice. Mice irradiated with 50 cGy also showed increased depressive behavior in the forced swim test. When cognitive performance was assessed, sham-irradiated mice of both sexes and mice irradiated with 25 cGy showed normal responses to object recognition and novel object exploration. However, object recognition was impaired in female and male mice irradiated with 50 or 200 cGy. For cortical levels of the neurotrophic factor BDNF and the marker of microglial activation CD68, there were sex x radiation interactions. In females, but not males, there were increased CD68 levels following irradiation. In males, but not females, there were reduced BDNF levels following irradiation. A significant positive correlation between BDNF and CD68 levels was observed, suggesting a role for activated microglia in the alterations in BDNF levels. Finally, sequential beam irradiation impacted the diversity and composition of the gut microbiome. These included dose-dependent impacts and alterations to the relative abundance of several gut genera, such as Butyricicoccus and Lachnospiraceae. Thus, exposure to rapidly delivered sequential proton, 16O ion, and 28Si ion irradiation significantly affects behavioral and cognitive performance, cortical levels of CD68 and BDNF in a sex-dependent fashion, and the gut microbiome.",Included
3330,"Neoadjuvant radiotherapy combined with capecitabine and sorafenib in patients with advanced KRAS-mutated rectal cancer: A phase I/II trial (SAKK 41/08) Background KRAS mutation occurs in ~40% of locally advanced rectal cancers (LARCs). The multitarget tyrosine kinase inhibitor sorafenib has radiosensitising effects and might improve outcomes for standard preoperative chemoradiotherapy in patients with KRAS-mutated LARC. Methods Adult patients with KRAS-mutated T3/4 and/or N1/2M0 LARC were included in this phase I/II study. The phase I dose-escalation study of capecitabine plus sorafenib and radiotherapy was followed by a phase II study assessing efficacy and safety. Primary end-points were to: establish the maximum tolerated dose of the regimen in phase I; determine the pathologic complete response (pCR) rate in phase II defined as Dworak regression grade 3 and 4. Results Fifty-four patients were treated at 18 centres in Switzerland and Hungary; 40 patients were included in the single-arm phase II study. Recommended doses from phase I comprised radiotherapy (45 Gy in 25 fractions over 5 weeks) with capecitabine 825 mg/m2 twice daily x 33 plus sorafenib 400 mg/d. Median daily dose intensity in phase II was radiotherapy 100%, capecitabine 98.6%, and sorafenib 100%. The pCR rate (Dworak 3/4) was 60% (95% CI, 43.3-75.1%) by central independent pathologic review. Sphincter preservation was achieved in 89.5%, R0 resection in 94.7%, and downstaging in 81.6%.

2511,"Impact of gamma radiation dose on sterility and quality parameters of Anastrepha fraterculus (Diptera: Tephritidae) Anastrepha fraterculus (Wiedemann, 1830) (Diptera: Tephritidae) is a major fruit pest, which is basicaly controlled using insecticides, which represents a risk to beneficial arthropods, human health and food contamination. The sterile insect technique (SIT) is a potential alternative tool for the management of this pest, however, only conflicting data is found regarding the optimal dose to achieve sterility. Thus, this study evaluated the effect of gamma radiation doses (0, 40, 50, 60 and 70 Gy) on male and female reproductive sterility, gonads morphometry, emergence, flight ability, and longevity under nutritional stress of A. fraterculus. Full female sterility was achieved at 50 Gy, while full male sterility was achieved at 70 Gy. Both ovarian and testicular sizes were affected by irradiation, while no influence was observed on the quality parameters evaluated. Our results suggest that 70 Gy applied 48 h before adult emergence can be used to sterilize A. fraterculus in a SIT programme.",Excluded
3681,"Guided Punctures with Ultrasound Volume Navigation in Percutaneous Transforaminal Endoscopic Discectomy: A Technical Note Objective: Ultrasound volume navigation (UVN) has been widely used for accurate guidance and decreased radiation exposure. However, few studies have focused on the clinical significance of UVN in guiding percutaneous puncture in percutaneous transforaminal endoscopic discectomy (PTED). We evaluated UVN to guide percutaneous puncture in PTED. Method(s): We retrospectively reviewed the medical records of 12 patients (8 men and 4 women), who had undergone PTED with the help of UVN or fluoroscopic guidance for lumbar disc herniation from November 2017 to December 2017. Result(s): The age of these 12 patients range was 26-71 years, and the body mass index range was 18.19-26.91 kg/m2. Of the 12 patients, 6 were in UVN group and 6 were in fluoroscopy group. The mean number of punctures was 1.00 in UVN group and 3.83 in fluoroscopy group. The mean exposure time was 3.60 and 13.80 seconds in UVN and fluoroscopy groups, respectively. The mean operation time was 48.17 minutes and 61.33 minutes in UVN and fluoroscopy groups, respectively. A positive relationship was found between operation time and exposure time (P < 0.05). All patients achieved excellent or good clinical outcomes. The Oswestry Disability Index and visual analog scales for leg pain and back pain all showed significant improvement after the procedure (P < 0.05). None of patients experienced a complication. Conclusion(s): UVN decreased the number of puncture attempts, radiation exposure, and operation time compared with fluoroscopic guidance in PTED. Therefore, UVN is a feasible and efficient method for guiding percutaneous puncture in PTED.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.",Excluded
3069,"The effects of radiofrequency hyperthermia on pain and function in patients with knee osteoarthritis: a preliminary report BACKGROUND: The clinical evidence of the efficacy of hyperthermia on osteoarthritis (OA) has not yet been clearly established. In addition, the application of a modality that can control the temperature inside the joints has not been reported. The purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of percutaneous radiofrequency hyperthermia, which could safely raise the temperature of the body core, in patients with OA knees., METHODS: Temperature changes inside the knee joint without OA were measured during exposure to radiofrequency. Radiofrequency hyperthermia was performed on 12 OA knees by exposure to 8 MHz and 200 W for 20 min, 3 times, at 1-week intervals. The clinical outcome was evaluated by use of the Lequesne index (LI) and the Japan Orthopaedic Association (JOA) scale. The osteoarthritis research society international (OARSI) responder criteria were also analyzed., RESULTS: Radiofrequency hyperthermia of 8 MHz and 200 W for 20 min increased the temperature inside the joint from 34.4 to 39.4degreeC. The LI decreased by 3.55 points from baseline during the 3 weeks. The JOA scale improved significantly during the period, reaching 86.25 points at the final examination from baseline of 67.5 points. 67% of patients had a response to the therapy according to OARSI criteria. No side effects were observed., CONCLUSIONS: Radiofrequency hyperthermia can safely increase the temperature inside the knee joint. Radiofrequency hyperthermia on OA knees provides a remarkable pain relief effect and can improve the patients' daily life. In the future, clinical studies should be performed with a protocol containing more cases, with appropriate control groups.",Excluded

The global and age-specific mortality rates appeared to be lower than those for the general population. The structure of mortality from external causes differed in some way from that of the general population: the percentage of accidents connected with transport and of murders was lower, whereas it was higher for suicides. The mortality rate from specific causes including suicides, however, was lower than in the general population. The level of radiation exposure did not influence the mortality rates from the studied causes.",Included

1809,"Study design for a case-control investigation of cellular telephones and other risk factors for brain tumours in adults The aetiology of brain tumours is poorly understood. Due, in part, to public concern about a postulated relationship between the use of cellular telephones or other increasingly prevalent environmental exposures and the incidence of brain cancer in adults, the National Cancer Institute is collaborating with three US hospitals in a comprehensive case-control study of malignant and benign brain tumours. Factors under consideration include use of cellular phones and other wireless communication devices, workplace exposures to chemical agents and electromagnetic fields, dietary factors, family history of tumours, genetic determinants of susceptibility, home appliance use, reproductive history and hormonal exposures, viruses, medical and dental exposure to ionising radiation, and other aspects of medical history. Approximately 800 newly diagnosed brain tumour cases and 800 controls were enrolled at hospitals in Boston, Phoenix and Pittsburgh from 1994 to 1998. Cases include all adults (age >= 18 y) newly diagnosed with a histologically confirmed intracranial glioma, histologically confirmed intracranial meningioma or acoustic neuroma. Controls are patients admitted to the same hospitals as the cases, and treated for any of a variety of non-malignant conditions. Key features of the study include its large size, the emphasis on rapid ascertainment of incident cases and interview of study subjects rather than surrogate respondents, the use of detailed, job-specific questions developed by industrial hygienists to ascertain occupational exposures, and the storage of blood samples for future evaluation of inherited susceptibility, biomarkers of exposure and gene-environment interactions.",Excluded
1662,"Improvement of image quality at low-radiation dose and low-contrast material dose abdominal CT in patients with cirrhosis: Intraindividual comparison of low tube voltage with iterative reconstruction algorithm and standard tube voltage OBJECTIVE: To intraindividually compare a low-tube voltage, low-contrast material dose computed tomography (CT) reconstructed with iterative reconstruction (IR) algorithm at standard tube voltage reconstructed with filtered back projection (FBP) and standard-contrast material dose during liver dynamic CT. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Twenty-five patients with liver cirrhosis underwent 64-section multidetector CT. One hundred twenty kilovolt (peak) (kV[p]) with standard contrast material dose of 600 mg of iodine per kilogram (protocol A) and 80 kV(p) with low-contrast material dose of 450 mg of iodine per kilogram (protocol B) CT image sets were reconstructed by using FBP algorithm and that of using IR algorithm with a 60%/40% blend of IR-FBP reconstruction at 80-kV(p) image set (protocol C). Scans obtained during 3 hepatic phases were subjected to quantitative and qualitative analysis. RESULT(S): The mean radiation dose and the contrast medium dose were significantly lower under protocols B and C than under protocol A. In all hepatic phases, all signal-to-noise and contrast-to-noise ratios were greater under protocol C than under other protocols at all anatomic sites. Qualitative analysis showed that image noise and diagnostic acceptability were significantly higher under protocol C. CONCLUSION(S): In all hepatic phases, a low-tube voltage, low-contrast material dose CT with IR algorithm yielded better contrast enhancement and image quality than a standard tube voltage, standard contrast material dose CT with FBP in thin adult patients.

1827,"Preoperative oxaliplatin, capecitabine, and external beam radiotherapy in patients with newly diagnosed, primary operable, cT3NxMo, low rectal cancer: A phase II study Purpose: In patients with locally advanced rectal cancer (LARC), preoperative chemoradiation is known to improve local control, and down-staging of the tumor serves as a surrogate for survival. Intensification of the systemic therapy may lead to higher down- staging rates and, thus, enhance survival. This phase II study investigated the efficacy and safety of preoperative capecitabine and oxaliplatin in combination with radiotherapy. Patients and Methods: Patients with LARC of the mid and lower rectum, T3NxM0 staged by MRI received radiotherapy (total dose 45 Gy) in combination with oral capecitabine (825 mg/m2 twice a day on radiotherapy days; weeks 1-4) and oxaliplatin 50 mg/m2 intravenously (days 1, 8, 15, and 22). Efficacy was evaluated as rate of tumor down-categorization at the T level. Result(s): A total of 59 patients were enrolled (19 women, 40 men; median age of 61 years) and all were evaluable for efficacy and toxicity. Down-categorization at the T level was observed in 53% with pathological complete response in 6 patients (10%). Actual total radiotherapy, oxaliplatin and capecitabine doses received were 97%, 90%, and 93% of the protocol-specified preplanned doses, respectively. Grade 3/4 toxicity was observed in 15 patients (25%). The most frequent was diarrhea (12%). Conclusion(s): Preoperative chemoradiation with capecitabine and oxaliplatin is feasible in patients with MRI-proven cT3 LARC. The only clinically relevant toxicity was diarrhea. Overall, efficacy of the multimodality treatment was good, but not markedly exceeding that of 5-FU- or capecitabine-based chemoradiation approaches. © Urban & Vogel.",Excluded
2166,"Sweat gland function as a measure of radiation change BACKGROUND: Radiotherapy may result in dryness of the skin even when no other change can be detected. We describe a system for recording the electrical conductance of skin as a measure of sweat gland function., PATIENTS AND METHODS: In 22 normal volunteers close agreement was obtained between measurements obtained from comparable sites on both sides of the chest. Measurements were subsequently made in 38 patients treated by radiotherapy to one side of the chest for tumours of the breast or lung using one of five different fractionation schedules. Simultaneous readings were obtained from both sides of the chest with the non irradiated side acting as a control., RESULTS: A dose response relationship was demonstrated: five patients who received the equivalent total dose of 15 Gy in 2-Gy fractions showed no change in conductance. Sixteen out of 23 who received an equivalent total dose of 42-46 Gy in 2-Gy fractions had a greater than 22% reduction in mean skin conductance compared with that of the control areas despite the skin appearing normal in the large majority. Marked changes in skin conductance were seen after higher total doses. In a prospective study 18 women receiving breast irradiation underwent weekly readings during treatment. A mean reduction of 40% in skin conductance was noted by the end of the second week of treatment prior to any clinical evidence of radiation change. Skin conductance returned to normal in 44% of patients by 6 months. In the remainder, those patients who showed the greatest reduction in skin conductance during treatment demonstrated the least recovery., CONCLUSIONS: Changes in sweat gland function can be detected and quantified in skin which may otherwise appear normal. Differences may so be demonstrated between areas treated using different fractionation schedules and the method may be applied to the detection during radiotherapy of unusually sensitive patient.",Excluded
1401,"Effects of low-dose and high-dose postoperative radioiodine therapy on the clinical outcome in patients with small differentiated thyroid cancer having microscopic extrathyroidal extension Background: It is unclear whether differentiated thyroid cancer (DTC) patients classified as intermediate risk based on the presence of microscopic extrathyroidal extension (ETE) should be treated with low or high doses of radioiodine (RAI) after surgery. We evaluated success rates and long-term clinical outcomes of patients with DTC of small tumor size, microscopic ETE, and no cervical lymph node (LN) metastasis treated either with a low (1.1GBq) or high RAI dose (5.5GBq). Method(s): This is a retrospective analysis of a historical cohort from 2000 to 2010 in a tertiary referral hospital. A total of 176 patients with small (<=2cm) DTC, microscopic ETE, and no cervical LN metastasis were included. Ninety-six patients were treated with 1.1GBq (LO group) and 80 patients with 5.5GBq (HI group). Successful RAI therapy was defined as (i) negative stimulated thyroglobulin (Tg) in the absence of Tg antibodies, and (ii) absence of remnant thyroid tissue and of abnormal cervical LNs on ultrasonography. Clinical recurrence was defined as the reappearance of disease after ablation, which was confirmed by cytologically or pathologically proven malignant tissue or of distant metastatic lesions. Result(s): There was no significant difference in the rate of successful RAI therapy between the LO and HI groups (p=0.75). In a subgroup analysis based on tumor size, success rates were not different between the LO group (34/35, 97%) and the HI group (50/56, 89%) in patients with a tumor size of 1-2cm (p=0.24). In patients with smaller tumor size (<=1cm), there was no significant difference in success rates between the LO (59/61, 97%) and HI groups (22/24, 92%; p=0.30). No patient had clinical recurrences in either group during the median 7.2 years of follow-up.

3072,"A prospective nonrandomized phase I/II study of carbon ion radiotherapy in a favorable subset of locally advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) BACKGROUND: Although concurrent chemoradiotherapy (CCRT) has become the standard approach for unresectable locally advanced non-small cell lung cancer (LA-NSCLC), most patients are not candidates for this treatment because of comorbidities. We evaluated the safety and efficacy of carbon ion radiotherapy (CIRT) in LA-NSCLC patients., METHODS: Patients with stage IIA to IIIA (UICC 7th edition) LA-NSCLC were enrolled in a sequential phase I/II trial. For a phase I dose escalation study, the total prescribed dose was increased by 4 Gray equivalents (GyE) in 2 steps, from 68 to 72 GyE and then to 76 GyE, using 16 fractions over 4 weeks. After determining the recommended dose, the phase II trial was started in an expanded cohort., RESULTS: Of the 36 patients treated in phase I, 2 grade 3 adverse events (radiation pneumonitis and tracheoesophageal fistula) were observed in the 76 GyE group. Accordingly, for phase II, the next consecutive 26 patients were treated with 72 GyE, with no grade 3 to 5 toxicities resulting. A total of 62 eligible patients were recruited. The majority of patients (49 of 62) were N0 or N1 patients, and the rest (13 of 62) were single-station N2 patients. The median follow-up period was 25.2 months. The 2-year local control rate (LCR) and overall survival (OS) for the entire cohort were 93.1% and 51.9%, respectively. In particular, patients with cT3-4N0 had an excellent prognosis; the 2-year OS and LCR were 69.3% and 100%, respectively., CONCLUSIONS: Short-course CIRT monotherapy shows promise as an effective nonsurgical treatment for inoperable LA-NSCLC.

33,"Olecranon fractures in adults: Factors influencing outcome In a retrospective, non-randomized study, we reviewed our experience with the operative treatment of olecranon fractures to find out which factors correlate with subjective complaints and functional outcome. A total of 95 consecutive olecranon fractures were operatively treated in our level I trauma institution between 1 March 1992 and 1 March 2000. Medical records and X-rays of all patients were evaluated. Three patients died, 23 were lost to follow-up. Fifty-eight of 69 available patients (84.0%) were reviewed clinically and/or radiologically after a mean time of 36 months. Fracture type, fracture classification, associated lesions, technical correctness of osteosynthesis, age and comorbidity were analysed. Radiological end result (intraarticular steps, gaps, arthrosis), subjective complaints, mobility of the elbow joint and muscle strength were evaluated. Patients with an unstable elbow (Mayo classification Type III and Schatzker-Schmeling classification Type D) had a higher loss of elbow function than others. There was a correlation between fracture morphology (fractures Type C and Type D in the Schatzker-Schmeling classification) and arthrosis. There also was a correlation between suboptimal osteosynthesis and arthrosis. There was no correlation between suboptimal osteosynthesis, implant loosening and secondary procedures. Patients more often expressed subjective complaints and loss of function in activities of daily life before than after metal removal. Primary elbow instability and fracture morphology are prognostic factors for elbow function and development of arthrosis after operative treatment of olecranon fractures. We, therefore, recommend the classification systems of the Mayo-clinic or of Schatzker-Schmeling. As many patients have complaints related to the implants, we recommend metal removal after fracture healing. © 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",Excluded
597,"Association between radiation dose and pathological complete response after preoperative radiochemotherapy in esophageal squamous cell cancer Aim: This study was undertaken to examine the impact of radiation dose on pathological complete response (pCR) rates following neoadjuvant radiochemotherapy (N-RCT) for squamous cell esophageal cancer (ESCC). Patients and Methods: From 1988 to 2011, 218 patients were treated with 30-30.6 Gy (1.8-2 Gy per fraction), 39.6-40 Gy (1.8-2 Gy per fraction) or 44-45 Gy (1.8-2 Gy per fraction) and concomitant cisplatin + 5-fluorouracil (5-FU), oxaliplatin + 5-FU or 5-FU alone. The most commonly used concomitant chemotherapy was continuous infusion of 5-FU-Alone with a dose of 300 mg/m2/day during the whole course of treatment (n=111). To eliminate the dispersing effect of potentially different efficacy levels of these drug regimens on pCR, we excluded patients with regimens other than 5-FU-Alone. Result(s): Histomorphological regression grade 1a (0% residual tumor), 1b (<10% residual tumor), 2 (10-50% residual tumor) and 3 (>50% residual tumor) was observed in 26 (23%), 24 (22%), 36 (32%) and 25 (23%) patients, respectively. pCR was observed in 9 out of 71 (13%) patients treated with 30 Gy-30.6 Gy, 13 of 34 (38%) patients treated with 39.6-40 Gy and 4 of 6 (67%) patients treated with 44-45 Gy (p=0.001). Median follow-up time from the start of N-RCT was 191 months (range=2-262 months). The estimated 5-year overall survival (OS) was 33% for the whole cohort. OS at 5 years was 58% for patients with pCR compared to 25% for patients with less favorable response to N-RCT (p=0.009), respectively. Conclusion(s): The dose of radiation correlates significantly with the likelihood of achieving a pCR in stage II/III squamous cell esophageal cancer patients. Prospective randomized trials are required to definitively evaluate the impact of application of higher radiation doses on efficacy and safety/tolerability in the context of N-RCT on the clinical outcomes.",Excluded
204,"Treatment efficiency of combining photodynamic therapy and ionizing radiation for Bowen's disease BACKGROUND: Topical 5-aminolevulinic acid photodynamic therapy (ALA-PDT) is widely used for treating Bowen's disease (BD), but recurrence and tumour cell persistence after ALA-PDT is sometimes problematic. Radiation therapy (RT) is also effective for BD, but is limited by its side-effects, such as refractory ulcers., OBJECTIVE: The objective of the study was to observe a synergic effect of combination therapy with ALA-PDT and RT for BD cases that did not respond effectively to prior ALA-PDT., METHODS: Subjects were BD patients whose lesion did not show complete remission or showed recurrence after prior ALA-PDT. A total of four cases involving four lesions were studied (three male and one female, mean age 69.5). ALA ointment (20%) was applied to the lesions. After 4 to 6h, subjects received combination therapy consisting of excimer-pumped dye laser radiation at 630nm (50J/cm(2) ) followed by electron-beam radiation (3Gy). The combination therapy was repeated every 2 to 3days for a total of four treatments. The lesions were evaluated clinically or histologically after the final combination therapy session., RESULTS: Following combination therapy, all of the lesions disappeared. Recurrence was not detected during the observations periods, which averaged 14.0months in duration., CONCLUSION: Our results indicate that the cure rate of BD could be improved by combination therapy with ALA-PDT and RT. Compared with conventional RT, the synergetic effect of this therapy might reduce the dose of radiation required, thereby also reducing skin side-effects such as refractory ulcers.

Background: Our aim was to investigate if patients with suspected myocardial infarction (MI) and a new or presumed new left bundle branch block (nLBBB) were treated according to the ESC reperfusion guidelines and to compare them with patients having a previously known LBBB (oLBBB). Furthermore, we investigated the prevalence of ST-segment concordance in this population. Method(s): Retrospective data was collected from the Swedeheart registry for patients admitted to the cardiac care unit at Orebro University Hospital with LBBB and suspected MI during 2009 and 2010. The patients were divided in two age groups; <80 or >=80 years and analysed for LBBB chronicity (nLBBB or oLBBB), MI, and reperfusion treatment. We also compared our data with the national Swedeheart database for 2009. Result(s): A total of 99 patients fulfilled the inclusion criteria. A diagnosis of MI was significantly more common in the group >=80 years compared to the group <80 years (53.8 vs. 25%, p=0.007). The rate of MI was similar in the groups with nLBBB and oLBBB (33 and 37% respectively, p=0.912). Of the 36 patients with a final diagnosis of MI, only eight (22%) had nLBBB. Reperfusion treatment, defined as an acute coronary angiography with or without intervention, was significantly more often performed in patients with nLBBB compared to patients with oLBBB (42 vs. 8%, p<0.001). The rate of MI and reperfusion treatment did not differ between our institution and the Swedish national data. ST-concordance was present in only two cases, one of which did not suffer an MI. Conclusion(s): The proportion of patients receiving reperfusion treatment was low, but higher in nLBBB, reflecting a partial adherence to the guidelines. We found no correlation between LBBB chronicity and MI. Furthermore, only a minority of the MIs occurred in patients with nLBBB. ST-concordance was found in only one of 36 MI cases, indicating lack of sensitivity for this test. © The European Society of Cardiology 2013.",Excluded

However, small or not peripheral nodules can be invisible or impalpable during toracoscopy, so difficult to localized. Many techniques have been developed to solve such problem. Herein we report our 13-years experience with Radio-guided One. Material(s) and Method(s): Patients with pulmonary nodules smaller than 1cm and/or deeper, below the visceral pleura, underwent CT-guided injection, into the nodule a solution composed by 0,2 ml 99Tc- labelled human serum albumin microsphers and 0,1 ml non-ionic contrast. Then, during the toracoscopic procedure, a 11 mm diameter-collimated probe connected to a gamma ray detector is introduced to scan the lung surface. The area of major radioactivity is resected. Result(s): From 1997 to 2009, 450 patients underwent toracoscopic resection of a small pulmonary nodules, 155 with the radio-guided technique. The patients were men and women, with average age of 60,6 (range: 12-83). Mean duration of surgical procedure was 43 min (range: 20 -100). The procedure was successful in 150/155 cases.

Patients with extrathyroideal extension of primary tumor and nodal metastases or M1 were not enrolled. 99 patients received 60 mCi, and 125--100 mCi of radioiodine as the first ablative dose. RESULT(S): The effectiveness of thyroid ablation was evaluated after one year, during endogenous TSH (thyroid stimulating hormone) stimulation, and after two years during Lthyroxine therapy. Whole body scintigraphy (WBS) was performed under thyroxine withdrawal and thyroglobulin serum level was assessed. Distant micrometastases were detected in 9.8% of patients by post-therapy WBS, 11 patients in group A treated with 60 mCi and 11 in group B treated with 100 mCi. In other patients no symptoms of persistent disease were detected. At one year follow up full remission was diagnosed in 176 patients: 76 in group A and 100 in group B. The remaining ones, 13.3% and 11.2% respectively, received the second course of (131)I for remnant ablation. There were no statistically significant differences in Tg (thyroglobulin) serum level either 12 or 24 months after 131I treatment. CONCLUSION(S): Our evaluation of early efficacy of adjuvant radioiodine treatment in low risk DTC patients shows no differences between two radioiodine activities - 60 and 100 mCi in relation to thyroid ablation. Thus, the activity of 60 mCi is recommended.",Excluded
3387,"Primary Tumour Resection Could Improve the Survival of Unresectable Metastatic Colorectal Cancer Patients Receiving Bevacizumab-Containing Chemotherapy BACKGROUND: The effect of primary tumour resection (PTR) among metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) patients remains controversial. Combination chemotherapy with bevacizumab could improve the clinical outcomes of these patients, which might change the importance of PTR in the multi-disciplinary treatment pattern., METHODS: We performed a non-randomized prospective controlled study of mCRC pts whose performance status (PS) scored <=2 and who received bevacizumab combination chemotherapy (FOLFOX/XELOX/FOLFIRI) as a first-line therapy. These patients were classified into the PTR group and the IPT (intact primary tumour) group according to whether they underwent PTR before receiving the systemic therapy. The progression free survival (PFS) time and overall survival (OS) time, which were recorded from the start of the primary diagnosis until disease progression and death or last follow-up, were analysed. We also compared severe clinical events (such as emergency surgery, radiation therapy, and stent plantation) between the two groups., RESULTS: One hundred and nighty-one mCRC pts (108 male patients and 93 female patients) were entered in this prospective observational study. The median age was 57.5 years old. The clinical characteristics (age, gender, performance status, primary tumour site, RAS status, and the number of metastatic organs) did not significantly differ between the two groups. The median PFS and OS times of the PTR group were superior than those of the IPT group (10.0 vs 7.8 months, p < 0.01 and 22.5 vs 17.8 months, p < 0.01, respectively). The incidences of adverse events associated with systemic therapy were similar between the two groups. Specifically, sixteen patients (21.9%, 16/73) with IPT developed significant primary tumour-related complications, such as bleeding, obstruction or even perforation. Among these patients, five underwent emergency surgery, three patients received a stent, and eight patients underwent radiation therapy., CONCLUSIONS: The mCRC patients who received PTR and bevacizumab combination chemotherapy had better clinical outcomes than patients who did not receive PTR. PTR also decreased the incidence of severe clinical events and improved quality of life. Copyright © 2016 The Author(s) Published by S. Karger AG, Basel.",Excluded
522,"Correlation between fracture healing status and euroqol score (EQ-5D) during conservative therapy for osteoporotic vertebral compression fractures INTRODUCTION: EQ-5D is a standardized instrument utilized as a measure of health related quality of life outcome. There are few reports investigating the relationship between fracture healing status and EQ-5D after conservative treatment for painful vertebral compression fractures (VCFs). METHOD(S): Forty consecutive patients (5 male, 35 female, average age: 78) had fresh VCFs due to primary osteoporosis diagnosed by MRI. They were treated in hospital for 2 to 3 weeks by conservative therapy consisting of medication (NSAIDs, Alendronate, Calcitonin) and brace. EQ-5D and questionnaires were collected at pre-fracture (retrospective) and post-fracture at first visit, at discharge and after 12-week conservative therapy. Radiographic evaluation was conducted by flexion-extension X-ray and CT. Pseudoarthrosis was diagnosed when the intervertebral cleft was seen in both X-ray and CT, and there was a motion more than 3-degrees in flexion-extension X-rays. Correlations among fracture healing status, brace compliance, and EuroQOL score were investigated. Final follow-up rate was 85% (34/40). RESULT(S): There were 30 patients who could move by themselves (Group A), and other 10 patients who could not even turn over due to severe pain (Group B). EQ-5D at pre-fracture, post-fracture, discharge, and after conservative therapy were 0.9067, 0.5030, 0.7538, and 0.7688 in Group A, 0.7359, -0.0179, 0.5546, and 0.7948 in Group B, respectively. Post-fracture EQ-5D in Group B was significantly lower (p<0.0001). Pseudoarthrosis was found in 6 cases (18%), while the intervertebral cleft was observed in 41 at 12-weeks. All these 6 cases answered as the brace compliance, almost all day"". Average EQ-5D in these 6 cases was 0.2657 at first visit and 0.689 after 12-week therapy, which was significantly lower than that of other fracture healed cases(0.8029, p=0.0001). DISCUSSION: Successful fracture healing rate in this conservative therapy was 82%. Eighteen percent of pseudoarthrosis patients with lower EQ-5D could be candidates for the interventional therapy.""",Excluded
654,"Is computed tomography cystography indicated in children with pelvic fractures? Purpose: Pelvic fracture evaluation with abdominopelvic computed tomography (CT) and formal CT cystography for rule out of urine bladder injury have been commonly employed in pediatric trauma patients. The additional delayed imaging required to obtain optimal CT cystography is, however, associated with increased doses of ionizing radiation to pelvic organs and represent a significant risk in the pediatric population for future carcinogenic risk. We hypothesized that avoidance of routine CT cystography among pediatric pelvic fracture victims would not result in an appreciable rate of missed bladder injuries and would aid in mitigating the radiation exposure risk associated with these additional images. Method(s): A retrospective cohort study involving blunt trauma pelvic fractures among pediatric trauma patients (age<14) between the years 1997 and 2016 was conducted utilizing the Israeli National Trauma Registry. Statistical analysis was performed using SAS statistical software version 9.4 via the tests of Chi-square test and two-sided Fisher's exact test. A p value of less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Result(s): A total of 1072 children were identified from the registry for inclusion. Mean age of patients was 7.7 years (range 0-14) and 713 (66.5%) were male. Overall mortality in this population was 4.1% (44/1072). Only 2.1% (23) of pediatric patients with pelvic fractures had bladder injury identified, with just 9 children having intraperitoneal bladder rupture (0.8% of all the patients). Conclusion(s): The vast majority of blunt pediatric trauma victims with pelvic fractures do not have urine bladder injuries. Based on our study results we do not recommend the routine utilization of CT cystography in this unique population. Copyright © 2019 Chinese Medical Association",Excluded
3366,"Monitoring of Tritium Internal Exposure Doses of Heavy-Water Reactor Workers in Third Qinshan Nuclear Power Plant To analyze the tritium internal exposure dose of workers in the Third Qinshan Nuclear Power Plant over the past 15 years. Urine samples provided by workers are tested directly to analyze the tritium concentrations and estimate internal exposure dose. Since 2004, an average of approximately 1600 workers have been monitored annually, with an average annual monitoring frequency of approximately 11 000. Since 2004, the average annual collective dose of tritium internal exposure was 149.62 person.mSv, accounting for 19.07% of the total annual collective dose. A total of 18 workers' annual individual internal tritium radiation doses exceeded 2 mSv, of which 5 workers' internal tritium radiation doses in a single intake exceeded 2 mSv. The occupational population with the largest total internal tritium radiation doses consists of maintenance personnel, fuel operators, and radiation protection personnel, whose collective doses of internal exposure account for 75.51% of the total collective doses within the plant. Over 15 years of operation, the internal tritium radiation doses of workers in the Third Qinshan Nuclear Power Plant have been strictly controlled within the national regulatory limit and power plant management target, ensuring the health and safety of the workers.Copyright © The Author(s) 2019.",Excluded
3171,"Comparison of safety and effectiveness between the right and left radial artery approach in percutaneous coronary intervention Introduction and objectives: There is a paucity of data comparing the left radial approach (LRA) and right radial approach (RRA) for percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) in all-comers populations and performed by operators with different experience levels. Thus, we sought to compare the safety and clinical outcomes of the RRA and LRA during PCI in ""real-world"" patients with either stable angina or acute coronary syndrome (ACS). Method(s): To overcome the possible impact of the nonrandomized design, a propensity score was calculated to compare the 2 radial approaches. The study group comprised 18 716 matched pairs with stable angina and 46 241 with ACS treated with PCI and stent implantation between 2014 and 2017 in 151 tertiary invasive cardiology centers in Poland (the ORPKI Polish National Registry). Result(s): The rates of death and periprocedural complications were similar for the RRA and LRA in stable angina patients. A higher radiation dose was observed with PCI via the LRA in both clinical presentations (stable angina: 1067.0 +/- 947.1 mGy vs 1007.4 +/- 983.5 mGy, P = .001; ACS: 1212.7 +/- 1005.5 mGy vs 1053.5 +/- 1029.7 mGy, P = .001). More contrast was used in LRA procedures but only in ACS patients (174.2 +/- 75.4 mL vs 167.2 +/- 72.1 mL, P = .001). Furthermore, periprocedural complications such as coronary artery dissection (0.16% vs 0.09%, P = .008), no-reflow phenomenon (0.65% vs 0.49%, P = .005), and puncture site bleeding (0.09% vs 0.05%, P = .04) were more frequently observed with the LRA in ACS patients. There was no difference in mortality between the 2 groups (P = .90). Conclusion(s): Our finding of poorer outcomes with the LRA may be related to lower operator experience with this approach. While both the LRA and RRA are safe in the setting of stable angina, the LRA was associated with a higher rate of periprocedural complications during PCI in ACS patients.

1380,"Acute and late toxicity of bilateral orbital irradiation in the management of primary intraocular lymphoma Purpose/Objective(s): Primary intraocular lymphoma (PIOL) is a rare malignancy with poor outcomes. Data suggest that a combination of chemotherapy and orbital radiation therapy (RT) results in better ocular disease control and improved survival, compared to treatment with either modality alone. However, some clinicians withhold RT out of concern for toxicity, particularly vision-threatening retinopathy. We aimed to quantify the ocular toxicity of RT in PIOL patients treated uniformly with chemoimmunotherapy and RT. We hypothesized that vision-threatening complications would be rare. Materials/Methods: Eleven patients were identified who received sequential R-MPV (rituximab, methotrexate, procarbazine, and vincristine), RT, and high-dose cytarabine. Clinical information was collected from the electronic medical record. Result(s): The median age was 66 years (range 48-72). Two patients had diabetes; 1 had unilateral grade 1 diabetic retinopathy at presentation. RT targeted the bilateral orbits to a median dose of 36 Gy (range 30.6-39.6 Gy) with opposed tangential 6 MV photon beams (18%), intensity modulated RT (27%), or appositional 12-16 MeV electron beams with custom skin collimation (55%). A multidisciplinary team, including an ocular oncologist, followed patients for a median of 42 months after RT (range 8-94). Common adverse events included dermatitis (100%), conjunctivitis (82%), exophthalmia (64%), and keratopathy (45%). All phakic eyes developed cataracts (100%); cases that underwent subsequent cataract extraction maintained good visual acuity. New, visually significant retinopathy was observed in only 1 eye (<5%) and affected the only patient with pre-existing diabetic retinopathy. There was no case of radiationinduced optic neuropathy. At diagnosis, visual acuity was 20/40 or better in 15/22 eyes (68%). In the patients who did not experience an intraocular disease relapse, visual acuity at last follow-up was 20/40 or better in 9/16 eyes (56%); of note, poor vision at last follow-up was attributed to uncorrected cataracts in 4 eyes and therefore was considered correctable. Conclusion(s): This report suggests that severe, vision-threatening complications are uncommon following orbital RT and chemo-immunotherapy for PIOL. In the absence of comorbidities, orbital RT should not be withheld due to fear of vision-threatening toxicity. The risk of toxicity may be augmented by comorbidities, so an individualized approach is recommended.",Excluded
1731,"Stereotactic radiosurgery for essential tremor: Retrospective analysis of a 19-year experience Background: Essential Tremor (ET) is a common movement disorder that can be disabling. Initial treatment is in the form of medical therapies. Patients with medically refractory ET seek surgical intervention which include radiofrequency thalamotomy, deep brain stimulation, and radiosurgical thalamotomy. Radiosurgical thalamotomy is a minimally invasive surgical option which is especially valuable for elderly and high surgical risk patients. Objective(s): The purpose of this study was to retrospectively analyze the outcomes of stereotactic radiosurgery for patients suffering from medically refractory essential tremor. Method(s): During a 19-year period (1996-2015), 73 patients underwent gamma knife thalamotomy for intractable essential tremor. A median central dose of 140 Gy (range, 130-150) was delivered to the nucleus ventralis intermedius through a single 4-mm isocenter. We used the Fahn-Tolosa-Marin clinical tremor rating scale to score tremor, handwriting, drawing, and ability to drink fluids. The median time to last follow-up was 28 months (range, 6-152). Result(s): After gamma knife thalamotomy, 93.2% improved in tremor. Forty-four patients (60.3%) experienced tremor arrest or barely perceptible tremor. Eighteen patients (24.7%) noted tremor arrest and complete restoration of motor function. Tremor improvement was sustained at last follow-up in 96% of patients who experience tremor relief. Mean tremor score improved from 3.19 before to 1.27 after gamma knife thalamotomy (P < 0.0001). Mean handwriting score improved from 2.97 to 1.25 (P < 0.0001). Mean drawing score improved from 3.16 to 1.26 (P < 0.0001). Mean drinking score improved from 3.14 to 1.56 (P < 0.0001). Imaging follow-up showed three types of lesions: enhancing lesion, streaking along internal capsule on fluid-attenuated inversion recovery, and significant reactive changes. Three patients (4%) experienced temporary adverse radiation effects. Conclusion(s): Radiosurgery is a safe and valuable treatment option for medically refractory essential tremor, especially for the elderly or those with high surgical risk for DBS or radiofrequency thalamotomy. © 2017 International Parkinson and Movement Disorder Society.",Excluded
84,"Late complications after high-dose-rate interstitial brachytherapy for tongue cancer Objectives. To analyze the treatment results and late complications of high-dose-rate (HDR) interstitial brachytherapy (ISBT) for early (T1N0, T2N0) mobile tongue cancer using the microSelectron-HDR. Methods. From January 1993 through April 2001, a total of 72 patients with early squamous cell carcinomas of the mobile tongue were treated with microSelectron-HDR interstitial brachytherapy at the Department of Radiology, Osaka University Hospital. Of the patients, 18% were treated with a combination of prior external radiation and HDR-ISBT, and 82% were treated with HDR-ISBT alone. For HDR-ISBT alone, all cases were treated with a total dose of 54 Gy/9 fractions every 5 days or 60 Gy/10 fractions every 8 days. In combined therapy with an external dose of 30 to 40 Gy, HDR-ISBT was given at a total dose of 42-50 Gy. The Brinkman and alcohol indexes were used to analyze the incidence of late complications after HDR-ISBT. Results. The 2- and 5-year local control rates were 85% and 82%, respectively. Fifteen of 72 patients (21%) treated with HDR-ISBT had late complications. Ten of 15 patients (67%) with late complications had a Brinkman index exceeding 600. Conclusions. HDR-ISBT is useful and easily applied under local anesthesia to early or superficial lesions of the mobile tongue. However, we found an increase in late complications, such as soft-tissue ulcers and bone exposure, after irradiation of tongue cancer with 60 Gy HDR-ISBT in patients with a Brinkman index greater than 600. © Japanese Society for Oral and Maxillofacial Radiology Springer-Verlag Tokyo 2005.",Excluded

We investigated the clinical features of GI toxicity after CRT in patients with LAPC and examined the effect of GI hemorrhage on survival. Method(s): Patients enrolled in this study had received CRT for pathologically proven LAPC. Their medical records were retrospectively reviewed. Result(s): A total of 156 patients with LAPC (median age, 65 years; range, 39 to 90 years) who received treatment between August 2005 and March 2009 were included in this study. The most common GI toxicities were ulcer formation (25.6%) and hemorrhage (25.6%), and the most common grade 3 to grade 5 GI toxicity was hemorrhage (65%). The origins of GI hemorrhage were gastric ulcer (37.5%), duodenal ulcer (37.5%), and radiation gastritis (15.0%). The independent risk factor for GI hemorrhage was tumor location in the pancreatic body. The median overall survival of the patients with a GI hemorrhage was 13.8 months (range, 2.8 to 50.8 months) and was not significantly different from that of patients without GI hemorrhage. Conclusion(s): GI hemorrhage was common in patients with LAPC after CRT. Although GI hemorrhage was controlled with endoscopic hemostasis, preventive measures should be investigated to reduce needless suffering.",Excluded
195,"A system for in vivo measurement of bone calcium by local neutron activation of the hand A 252Cf neutron-irradiation facility designed specifically for clinical in vivo measurement of calcium in the hand is described. Results of preliminary measurements are presented. Hand phantoms were exposed to the neutron beam for 10 min and the induced 49Ca activities were counted for 10 min after an elapsed time of 2 min. The results indicate that with a 2 X 100 micrograms 252Cf neutron source and two 20.3 X 12.7 cm NaI crystals, the counts per gram of bone mineral mass changes by about 4% for each 100 cm3 change in the overall volume (soft tissue plus bone) of the hand. For hands of equal volumes the counts per gram are expected to be almost independent of the bone volume. With an absorbed dose equivalent of 150 mSv (15 rem), the sensitivity is about 200 counts per 10 min per gram Ca.

831,"Computer-Assisted Distal Radius Osteotomy Purpose: To establish the accuracy, precision, and clinical feasibility of a novel technique of computer-assisted distal radius osteotomy for the correction of symptomatic distal radius malunion. Method(s): Six patients underwent a computer-assisted distal radius osteotomy and were followed-up for an average of 25 months. Objective radiographic measurements and functional outcomes, as measured by clinical examination including grip strength and range of motion, and Disability of the Arm, Shoulder and Hand (DASH) questionnaires, were used. Result(s): The mean radiographic parameters included an increase of radial inclination to 21degree from 12degree (normal, 23degree). Dorsal and volar tilt (malunion) were corrected to 9degree from -30degree and 21degree, respectively (normal, 10degree). Ulnar variance was corrected to 1.9 mm from 7.5 mm (normal, +1.5 mm). Normal is defined as the average of the contralateral limb radiographs. The mean clinical outcome measures at an average of 25 months included a DASH global score of 14, a DASH individual item average score of 1.6, and an average affected side grip strength of 79% when compared with the unaffected side. Conclusion(s): The results of the computer-assisted technique were comparable with published results of traditional non-computer-assisted opening wedge osteotomy techniques. This technique allows a surgeon to accurately and precisely recognize and correct 3-dimensional deformities of the distal radius including axial malalignment (supination). The technique has the added benefit of reducing radiation exposure to the patient and surgical team because fluoroscopy is not used during the procedure. Additional benefits of the computer-assisted technique include the ability to perform multiple surgical simulations to optimize the alignment plan, and it serves as an excellent teaching tool for less-experienced surgeons.

1596,"Unusual presentation of gouty arthrittis Case Presentation: Gout is a crystalline arthropathy characterized by the deposition of urate crystals in joints. Typically, it involves the first metatarsophalangeal joint (podagra), ankle, or knee joint, although other joints may be affected. Gout presents as an acute mono- or oligoarticular arthritis with warm, tense, dusky red overlying skin. Increased serum uric acid may be seen in 70% cases of acute gout. Gout occurs in men and postmenopausal women, and risk factors include diabetes, hypertension, chronic kidney disease, increased purine intake, alcohol, diuretic therapy, land ow-dose aspirin. Definitive diagnosis is made through arthrocentesis with polarized microscopic examination of the synovial fluid showing intracellular or extracellular needle-shaped, negatively birefringent crystals. Discussion(s): A 61-year-old postmenopausal female with a history of moderate L4-L5 central spinal canal stenosis and hypertension, presented with 3 weeks of severe right lower-extremity pain, felt over the right hip, radiating to the right leg, and worsened on weight bearing. Multiple prior evaluations in the emergency room for these symptoms revealed unremarkable x-rays of the back, hips, and pelvis. Treatment with opiates and NSAIDs was ineffective. The patient was able to recall an isolated episode of possible podagra more than 10 years prior to her current events. On examination, flexion and extension of the right hip elicited slight tenderness, and point tenderness was noted over the right sacroiliac joint. A right knee effusion was detected. Laboratory examination was remarkable for a normal CBC and CMP, and her ESR (55 mm/Hg) and CRP (39 mg/L) were elevated along with a high serum uric acid level (10 mg/dL). On further investigation, MRI imaging revealed right-sided sacroiliitis along with edema in the iliopsoas region. CT-guided joint aspiration revealed large amounts of intra- and extracellular, negatively birefringent monosodium urate crystals along with prominent tophaceous formations. Infection was excluded. Diagnosis of chronic tophaceous gout with acute gouty sacroiliitis and a possible component of crystalline iliopsoas tendonitis was made. Patient refused intra-articular steroid injection and was treated with systemic glucocorticoids. Uric acid-lowering therapy with allopurinol was started on outpatient follow-up. Conclusion(s): Characteristically, gout affects peripheral joints, and axial involvement is considered infrequent. Literature on axial gout is limited to case reports and case series. Reports suggest that axial radiographic involvement in gout is frequently underrecognized, as it may remain subclinical. Patients with acute gouty sacroiliitis may present with pain referred to the thigh, hip, or back, and crystalline iliopsoas tendonitis may further restrict hip movement, as seen in our case. Acute gouty arthritis should be considered in patients presenting with sacroiliac joint pain, particularly if they have a history of gout or risk factors for this form of rheumatism.",Excluded

282,"Isolation of Chlamydia trachomatis by use of 5-iodo-2-deoxyuridine-treated cells Irradiated McCoy cells have provided a useful technique for the isolation of Chlamydia trachomatis strains, among which are found the etiological agents of trachoma, inclusion conjunctivitis, and lymphogranuloma venereum. Because irradiation is not always readily available, 5-iodo-2-deoxyuridine (IUDR) treatment of cells was investigated as a substitute procedure. IUDR-treated cells were found to be as sensitive to C. trachomatis infection as were irradiated McCoy cells. Stock chlamydial strains gave similar titers of iodine-stained inclusions in either system. When cells treated with IUDR were compared with irradiated cells for the isolation of C. trachomatis from clinical specimens, 5 of 138 specimens yielded isolates in IUDR-treated cells not found in irradiated ones, and one isolate was obtained from irradiated but not from IUDR-treated cells. In those 56 cases where inclusions were seen in both systems, there were significantly more inclusions in IUDR-treated than in irradiated cells. Although this series of cultures is too small to determine whether IUDR-treated cells are superior to irradiated ones for the isolation of C. trachomatis, the data indicate that IUDR treatment is at least equally effective.",Excluded

We examined the association between citrus consumption and subsequent incident malignant melanoma among participants in the Nurses' Health Study (1984-2010) and the Health Professionals Follow-up Study (1986-2010). Among 105,437 participants over 2 million person-years of follow-up, we documented 1857 incident melanomas. The pooled multivariate-adjusted hazard ratio for melanoma comparing the extreme total citrus consumption categories (1.5 or more serving per day vs. less than twice per week) was 1.30 (95 confidence interval [CI], 1.08 to 1.57) (P=0.003 for trend). Grapefruit and orange juice were two individual citrus products that showed significant associations with risk of melanoma. The pooled multivariate-adjusted hazard ratios for melanoma were 1.41 (95% CI, 1.09 to 1.82) comparing the extreme consumption categories of grapefruit (three times or more per week vs. never, P=0.004 for trend) and 1.26 (95% CI, 1.02 to 1.56) comparing the extreme consumption categories of orange juice (once or more per day vs. never, P=0.001 for trend). Significant positive associations between citrus consumption and risk of melanoma were also observed for invasive melanoma and melanoma that occurred on the head, neck and extremities, and among participants who spent more time in direct sunlight since high school and resided in areas with higher solar ultraviolet radiation in the US. In conclusion, we found that consumption of grapefruit and orange juice was positively associated with risk of malignant melanoma among US women and men.",Excluded
306,"Diagnostic accuracy of 320-row computed tomography as compared with invasive coronary angiography in unselected, consecutive patients with suspected coronary artery disease Noninvasive coronary angiography with multislice computed tomography (CT) scanners is feasible with high sensitivity and negative predictive value. The radiation exposure associated with this technique, however, is high and concerns in the widespread use of CT have arisen. We evaluated the diagnostic accuracy of coronary angiography using 320-row CT, which avoids exposure-intensive overscanning and overranging. We prospectively studied 118 unselected consecutive patients with suspected coronary artery disease (CAD) referred for invasive coronary angiography (ICA). All patients had 320-row CT within 1 week of ICA, which, together with quantitative analysis, served as the reference standard. Of the 65 out of 118 patients who were diagnosed as having CAD by ICA, 64 (98 %) were correctly identified at 320-row CT. Noteworthy, 320-row CT correctly detected CAD in 3 patients with atrial fibrillation and ruled out the disease in the other 8 patients. From 151 significant coronary stenoses detected on ICA, 137 (91 %) were correctly identified with 320-row CT. In the per-patient analysis, sensitivity and specificity of 320-row CT were 98 and 91 %, respectively. In the per-vessel analysis, sensitivity and specificity of 320-row CT were 93 and 95 %, respectively. In the per segment analysis, sensitivity and specificity of 320-row CT were 91 and 99 %, respectively. Diameter stenosis determined with the use of CT showed good correlation with ICA (P < 0.001, R = 0.81) without significant underestimation or overestimation (-3.1 +/- 24.4 %; P = 0.08). Comparison of CT with ICA revealed a significantly smaller effective radiation dose (3.1 +/- 2.3 vs. 6.5 +/- 4.2 mSv; P < 0.05) and amount of contrast agent required (99 +/- 51 vs. 65 +/- 42 ml, P < 0.05) for 320 row CT. The present study in an unselected population including patients with atrial fibrillation demonstrates that 320-row CT may significantly reduce the radiation dose and amount of contrast agent required compared with ICA while maintaining a very high diagnostic accuracy.",Excluded

Method(s): Seventy-three patients of 70 years old or above treated at our institution between January 1995 and December 2008 for locoregionally advanced NPC (stage III-IVA) were reviewed and analyzed. All patients were treated in a uniform fashion using our institutional protocol with using conformal radiation therapy alone. Measured outcomes included 4-year overall survival (OS), tumor-specific survival (TSS), disease-free survival (DFS), local control (LC), regional relapse-free survival (RRFS), distant metastasis free survival (DMFS), as well as late toxicity. Result(s): The median follow-up for all 73 patients at the time of this analysis was 45 months (range, 5-152 months). The 4-year OS, TSS, DFS, LC, RRFS, and DMFS were 51.0, 64.5, 54.7, 83.7, 80.6, and 63.5, respectively. Radiation therapy was well tolerated in this group of patients. Multivariate analyses revealed that clinical stage (P = 0.006) and comorbidities (P = 0.018) were significant prognosticators for OS, both N classification (P = 0.023) and comorbidities (P = 0.032) were significant prognosticators for DFS, N classification was the only independent prognostic factor for both TSS (P = 0.002) and DMFS (P = 0.004); and residual disease in the primary site was the only independent predictive factor for LC (P = 0.026). Conclusion(s): Radiation therapy alone can achieve a reasonable local and regional control in NPC patients with advanced age; however, distant metastasis remained the dominant failure pattern of our series. The presence of comorbidities was an important negative prognostic factor for treatment outcome. © 2012 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.",Excluded
2523,"Value of intra-tumor heterogeneity evaluated by diffusion-weighted MRI for predicting pathological stages and therapeutic responses to chemoradiotherapy in lower rectal cancer Aim: Diffusion-weighted MRI (DWI) has the potential to reveal intra-tumor structural heterogeneity consisting of stroma through an evaluation of uniformity on DWI. In present study, we examined the diagnostic value of intra-tumor heterogeneity evaluated by DWI in lower rectal cancer (LRC). Patients and Methods: A total of 172 LRC patients underwent radical surgery between 2009 and 2017. T1 tumors and cases without pre-operative MRI were excluded. Twenty-nine primary resection cases (PR) and 37 pre-operative chemoradiotherapy followed by radical surgery cases (pCRT) were targeted. Intra-tumor heterogeneity on DWI was quantified using a specific formula (HSD). Structural heterogeneity was objectively quantified by an image analysis of resected specimens using a digital microscope (HSP). The relationships between HSD and HSP, pathological factors, and tumor regression grades (TRG) of pCRT were evaluated. Result(s): The relationship between HSD and HSP was analyzed by a linear regression model in PR cases, revealing a positive correlation (R2=0.43). PR cases were divided into HSD-high and HSD-low according to the median. There were more pT3 or N(+) cases in HSD-high (p=0.038, 0.095). HSD before pCRT correlated with TRG (grade 1 versus 2/3) in pCRT cases (p=0.001). The diagnostic accuracy of HSD for predicting T and N stages and therapeutic grades was evaluated by cut-off values calculated using a ROC curve and revealed that each factor may be accurately diagnosed. Conclusion(s): Intra-tumor heterogeneity on DWI corresponded with stromal pathological heterogeneity. It is useful for predicting T3 or deeper tumor invasion, pathological N(+), and the therapeutic effects of pCRT.Copyright © The author(s).",Excluded
1776,"Low-dose multidetector-row CT-angiography of abdominal aortic aneurysm after endovascular repair PURPOSE: To investigate the possibility of reducing radiation dose exposure while maintaining image quality using multidetector computed tomography angiography (MDCTA) with high-concentration contrast media in patients undergoing follow-up after endovascular aortic repair (EVAR) to treat abdominal aortic aneurysm., MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this prospective, single center, intra-individual study, patients underwent two consecutive MDCTA scans 6 months apart, one with a standard acquisition protocol (130 mAs/120 kV) and 120 mL of iomeprol 300, and one using a low dose protocol (100 mAs/80 kV) and 90 mL of iomeprol 400. Images acquired during the arterial phase of contrast enhancement were evaluated both qualitatively and quantitatively for image noise and intraluminal contrast enhancement., RESULTS: Thirty adult patients were prospectively enrolled. Statistically significantly higher attenuation values were measured in the low-dose acquisition protocol compared to the standard protocol, from the suprarenal abdominal aorta to the common femoral artery (p<0.0001; all vascular segments). Qualitatively, image quality was judged significantly (p=0.0002) better with the standard protocol than with the low-dose protocol. However, no significant differences were found between the two protocols in terms of contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR) (13.63+/-6.97 vs. 11.48+/-8.13; p=0.1058). An overall dose reduction of up to 74% was observed for the low-dose protocol compared with the standard protocol., CONCLUSION: In repeat follow-up examinations of patients undergoing EVAR for abdominal aortic aneurysm, a low-dose radiation exposure acquisition protocol provides substantially reduced radiation exposure while maintaining a constant CNR and good image quality.

1785,"Clinical results of intraarticular calcaneal fractures in long-term follow-up Introduction: Clinical results of Calcaneal fractures are often poor because of unsatisfactory reduction, and other problems. In this study, we assessed long-term outcomes after ORIF of intraarticular calcaneal fractures, as well as outcomes of salvage surgery performed for patients with poor outcomes. Method(s): The subjects were 11 patients who were treated with ORIF and followed up for at least 5 years after surgery and 56 patients with poor outcomes, after initial surgery performed at another hospital. Salvage procedures performed for these patients were the lift-up of joint surface (36 feet), arthrodesis (17 feet), and observation without intervention (3 feet). Clinical assessment was based on Maxfield's criteria, and imaging assessment was based on X-ray findings. The mean postoperative follow-up periods were 6. 4 years in ORIF group and 4. 2 years in the lift-up or arthrodesis group. Result(s): ORIF group were excellent for 4 feet, good: 6, fair: 0, poor:1, and osteoarthritic (OA) changes were observed in 2. Lift-up of joint group were excellent: 26, good:7, fair:3, poor:none, OA:3. Arthrodesis group were excellent:11, good:3, fair:3, poor:none. Conclusion(s): If ORIF under the satisfactory reduction is performed, long-term outcomes would be good or excellent without any OA changes. When outcomes of initial surgery are poor, they may complain of pain soon after the initial surgery and require additional salvage surgery within 3 years. Long-term outcomes for calcaneal fractures are greatly affected by satisfactory or unsatisfactory reduction.",Excluded

2739,"The association between cumulative radiation dose and the incidence of severe oral mucositis in head and neck cancers during radiotherapy Background: Quality of life can be influenced by oral mucositis (OM), and it is necessary to implement OM management strategies before the initiation of radiotherapy (RT) in patients with head and neck cancer (HNC). Aim(s): To examine the association between the cumulative radiation dose and the incidence of severe OM in HNC patients receiving RT. Methods and Results: A retrospective observational cohort study was conducted in a Showa University Fujigaoka Hospital, in Japan. We retrospectively analyzed 94 patients with HNC who developed OM during RT. We defined OM as a more than grade 2 OM. The cumulative incidence of OM curves of the two categories was estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method and compared using the log-rank test. We estimated the hazard ratio (HR) for OM after the adjustment of factors for covariates using Cox's regression analysis. Patients with smoking history had a significantly later development of OM than those with no smoking history (20 Gy-incidence OM 68.7% vs 39.7%, P =.003). In contrast, patients undergoing concurrent chemotherapy had an earlier development of OM than those undergoing RT alone (20 Gy-incidence OM 24.2% vs 55.7%, P <.001). Multivariate analysis revealed that no smoking history and concurrent chemotherapy were independent predictive factors, with a HR of 0.526 (P =.025) and 2.690 (P <.001), respectively. Conclusion(s): We demonstrated that no smoking history and concurrent chemotherapy may be predictive of OM in HNC patients.Copyright © 2020 The Authors.

Primary parotid gland carcinoma patients (n = 23) treated with 125I brachytherapy alone between 1 October 2005 and 31 July 2013 at Peking University Stomatology Hospital were enrolled in this retrospective study. All had clinical stage IV disease. The prescribed dose was 60-160 Gy. The local control rate, survival rate, and predictors of the prognosis were evaluated. Adverse events related to treatment were also noted. The average follow-up time was 29 months (range 9-74 months). Among the 23 patients, six had local failure and 11 died during the follow-up period. The 1-, 3-, and 5-year overall survival rates were 87.0%, 55.4%, and 47.5%, respectively. The 1-, 3-, and 5-year progression-free survival rates were 73.9%, 47.0%, and 39.2%, respectively. The 1-, 3-, and 5-year local control rates were 82.1%, 73.9%, and 73.9%, respectively. Age and distant metastasis were independent predictors of survival, while the preoperative duration of the disease was an independent predictor of local control. The use of 125I seed brachytherapy alone for the treatment of primary parotid gland carcinoma can provide good short-term results without causing any severe side effects.Copyright © 2017",Excluded
942,"Assessing the Association Between Electrical Stimulation Dose, Subsequent Cognitive Function and Depression Severity in Patients Receiving Bilateral Electroconvulsive Therapy for Major Depressive Disorder OBJECTIVE: To assess the relationship between electrical stimulation administered to patients undergoing bilateral electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) and subsequent measures of cognitive function and depression severity., METHODS: Stimulus dose titrated patients receiving bilateral ECT were assessed with the Cambridge Neuropsychological Test Automated Battery (CANTAB) Spatial Recognition Memory test and Montgomery Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) at baseline, after 4 ECT treatments and on course completion. Changes in CANTAB and MADRS scores were assessed in relation to electrical dosage, initial stimulus dose, and demographic variables using linear mixed models., RESULTS: Data pertained to 143 patients (mean age, 56.85 [SD, 14.94], 43% male). Median change in CANTAB score was -10% (-20% to 5%) after 4 ECT treatments and -10% (-20% to 5%) at course completion. Median change in MADRS score was -22 (-33 to -13) after 4 ECT treatments and -14 (-25 to -7) at course completion. Electrical dosage had no effect on CANTAB or MADRS change scores either after 4 treatments or course completion. Improvement in CANTAB score at end of course was associated with female sex (P < 0.05), higher intelligence quotient (P = 0.01), and age. After 4 treatments, improvement in CANTAB score was associated with younger age (P < 0.001) and higher intelligence quotient (P < 0.01). Improved MADRS score at course completion was associated with older age (P < 0.001 at end of course and after 4 treatments)., CONCLUSIONS: Electroconvulsive therapy has significant antidepressant and cognitive effects which are not associated with the total electrical dose administered. Other, unalterable variables, such as age and sex, have an influence on these effects.",Excluded
1653,"Malignant melanoma in Connecticut and Denmark The rising incidence of malignant melanoma of the skin was reviewed using data from the Connecticut Tumor Registry (1935-1974) (Eisenberg et al., 1967) and the Danish Cancer Registry (1943-1972) (Clemmesen, 1965, 1974, 1977). A total of 7,530 cases were analyzed according to age, sex and anatomic site. The total age-adjusted incidence rates were similar for these two areas, despite geographic and demographic differences. However, the most rapid changes in melanoma incidence were observed in females from Denmark and males from Connecticut. In addition, the largest increases occurred for lower-extremity lesions in Danish middle-aged women and trunk-neck melanomas in Connecticut middle-aged men. Melanoma of the face was resistant to changing incidence and occurred in an older age group than melanoma of other skin sites. In general, birth cohort analysis confirmed that changing incidence began for persons born around 1900, but the rising incidence for lower-extremity melanomas in women and trunk-neck melanomas in males began earlier. In comparing incidence for anatomic sites by correcting for surface area and melanocyte density, higher than expected rates were seen for melanoma of the face in both sexes and trunk-neck melanomas in males. The data presented supported the concept that a cumulative exposure to solar radiation may be important in the etiology of melanoma of the face, but short, intense sun exposure is probably related to melanoma in other sun-exposed areas, and that melanoma in areas other than the face is responsible for the rising incidence of this disease.",Excluded

From January 2001 to June 2004, 101 patients with the same diagnoses underwent either hyperfractionated radiotherapy, with 74.4-79.2 Gy delivered in 6.2-7 weeks (1.2 Gy per fraction twice a day), or accelerated fractionation with concomitant boost, which delivered 68.7-72 Gy in 6 weeks (1.8 Gy per fraction a day and 1.5 Gy per fraction a day to a boost filed as a second daily treatment for the last 11-12 treatment days). Locoregional relapse and overall survival were recorded., RESULTS: Complete response to treatment was obtained in 31 of 51 patients treated with conventional fractionation, 33 of 50 patients treated with hyperfractionation, and 36 of 51 patients treated with accelerated fractionation. No significant differences were observed among the patients treated with conventional, hyperfractionated, or accelerated radiotherapy modalities either in locoregional control rate (41% vs 35% vs 49%, respectively; P=0.690) or overall survival rate (50% vs 40% vs 51%, respectively; P=0.760).

The payload, to be integrated inside the Space Shuttle middeck during transportation and inside the Express Rack in the ISS during experiment execution, was designed to function autonomously for more than 3 months and to involve crew only for maintenance activities. In its first mission, three wild type (Wt) and three transgenic male mice over-expressing pleiotrophin under the control of a bone-specific promoter (PTN-Tg) were housed in the MDS. At the time of launch, animals were 2-months old. MDS reached the ISS on board of Shuttle Discovery Flight 17A/STS-128 on August 28(th), 2009. MDS returned to Earth on November 27(th), 2009 with Shuttle Atlantis Flight ULF3/STS-129 after 91 days, performing the longest permanence of mice in space. Unfortunately, during the MDS mission, one PTN-Tg and two Wt mice died due to health status or payload-related reasons. The remaining mice showed a normal behavior throughout the experiment and appeared in excellent health conditions at landing. During the experiment, the mice health conditions and their water and food consumption were daily checked. Upon landing mice were sacrificed, blood parameters measured and tissues dissected for subsequent analysis. To obtain as much information as possible on microgravity-induced tissue modifications, we organized a Tissue Sharing Program: 20 research groups from 6 countries participated.

3474,"Radiation dose considerations in the palliative treatment of locally advanced adenocarcinoma of the pancreas Treatment of locally advanced pancreatic cancer with high-dose radiotherapy has not been curative, and can be difficult to tolerate. We decided to compare retrospectively the outcomes of patients treated concurrently with 5-fluorouracil and either 30 Gy or more than 30 Gy of radiation. From December 1993 through May 2001, 107 patients with locally advanced adenocarcinoma of the pancreas had been treated with palliative chemoradiation. Eighty-six patients had received a prescribed dose of 30 Gy and 50.4 Gy had been prescribed in 18 patients. Two of these patients were unable to complete the full dose of radiotherapy due to toxicity, and 3 received intraoperative radiotherapy boost (20 Gy). Three additional patients received a prescribed dose of 33 Gy, 36 Gy, and 52.2 Gy, respectively. These patients were grouped together (n = 21, median 50.4 Gy). All patients had received concurrent protracted venous infusions of 5-fluorouracil (300 mg/m Monday through Friday). The median survival time was not affected significantly by a higher radiotherapy dose (8 months for the 30 Gy group versus 9 months for the group receiving higher doses; P = 0.64). The 6-month actuarial progression rates were 45% versus 50% (P = 0.90) for local disease progression, and 54% versus 50% (P = 0.94) for distant metastasis for the 30 Gy and the higher dose groups, respectively. Ten of the 86 patients (12%) who had received 30 Gy were hospitalized for treatment-related gastrointestinal toxicity (grade 3) versus 6 of the 21 (29%) patients given higher doses (P = 0.05). Compared with higher doses given over 5 to 6 weeks, chemoradiation (30 Gy in 10 fractions in 2 weeks with concurrent infusional 5-FU) results in a similar median survival, and local disease progression rates in patients with locally advanced pancreatic cancer apparently do not substantially improve local disease control or median survival time. Because higher doses of radiotherapy can lead to increased acute treatment-related morbidity, we recommend using 30 Gy in 10 fractions unless the patient is part of a prospective study evaluating novel biologic or cytotoxic radiosensitizers.",Excluded
1179,"Radical chemoradiotherapy for elderly patients with bladder carcinoma invading muscle BACKGROUND: Chemoradiotherapy is becoming an alternative to radical cystectomy among patients with bladder carcinoma invading muscle. In 1988, the authors began a protocol with methotrexate, vinblastine, doxorubicin, and cisplatin (M-VAC regimen) and radiotherapy for these patients. Traditionally, age has been considered a determinant factor thereby excluding the older patients from the oncologic protocols that are considered to be more aggressive. The authors analyzed 20 patients (age > 70 years) who were treated during this period with the same protocol as the authors' other patients., METHODS: The study included 20 patients (age range, 70-78 years; median age, 74 years) including 4 patients with T2 disease, 9 with T3 disease, and 7 with T4 disease. All patients had a Karnofsky performance status of > 60. Treatment protocol included cytoreductive transurethral resection, 2 cycles of M-VAC chemotherapy, and radiotherapy (45 grays [Gy] on pelvic volume) with concurrent cisplatin (20 mg/m2 on Days 1-5. Response was determined by cystoscopic evaluation. If there was a complete response, radiotherapy continued until a total dose of 65 Gy; if there was not a complete response, cystectomy was performed., RESULTS: Tumor response after a dose of 45 Gy included 11 complete responses (55%), 5 partial responses (25%), and 4 nonresponses (20%). Overall survival was 75%, 34%, and 27% in the 2nd, 3rd, and 5th years of follow-up, respectively. Cause specific survival was 79%, 54%, and 38%, respectively. Survival for patients with complete response was 100%, 60%, and 48%, respectively. Severe toxicity was uncommon, with the most frequent toxicities being leukopenia and cystitis. No treatment-related death occurred with either treatment protocol., CONCLUSIONS: The age of the individual must not become a strict exclusion criterion for the radical treatment of old patients with invasive bladder carcinoma.",Excluded

While MTG16 loss renders mice sensitive to chemicalcolitis, the role of MTG16 in the small intestine is unknown. Histologicalexamination revealed that Mtg16-/- mice have increasedenterocyte proliferation and goblet cell deficiency. After exposure toradiation, Mtg16-/- mice exhibited increased crypt viability anddecreased apoptosis compared with wild-type (WT) mice. Flow cytometricand immunofluorescence analysis of intestinal epithelial cellsfor phospho-histone H2A.X also indicated decreased DNA damageand apoptosis in Mtg16-/- intestines. To determine if Mtg16 deletionaffected epithelial cells in a cell-autonomous fashion, intestinal cryptswere isolated from Mtg16-/- mice. Mtg16-/-and WT intestinalcrypts showed similar enterosphere forming efficiencies when culturedin the presence of EGF, Noggin, and R-spondin. However, whenMtg16-/- crypts were cultured in the presence of Wnt3a, theydemonstrated higher enterosphere forming efficiencies and delayedprogression to mature enteroids. Mtg16-/- intestinal crypts isolatedfrom irradiated mice exhibited increased survival compared with WTintestinal crypts. Interestingly, Mtg16 expression was reduced in astem cell-enriched population at the time of crypt regeneration. Thisis consistent with MTG16 negatively regulating regeneration in vivo.Taken together, our data demonstrate that MTG16 loss promotesradioresistance and impacts intestinal stem cell function, possibly dueto shifting cellular response away from DNA damage-induced apoptosisand towards DNA repair after injury.Copyright © 2015 the American Physiological Society.",Included
1164,"A Novel Targeted Foraminoplasty Device Improves the Efficacy and Safety of Foraminoplasty in Percutaneous Endoscopic Lumbar Discectomy: Preliminary Clinical Application of 70 Cases Objective: Percutaneous endoscopic lumbar discectomy (PELD) has become a mature and mainstream surgical technique for treating lumbar disc herniation (LDH); however, there is a steep learning curve with PELD, especially for puncture and foraminoplasty. In this study, we assessed the outcome and safety of a novel quantificational and targeted foraminoplasty device named ZESSYS for LDH. Method(s): From September to December of 2016, 70 patients with symptomatic LDH were enrolled in the study. The patients were assigned randomly to either the ZESSYS group or the conventional TESSYS group. We recorded the cannula introduction time, decompression time, radiation exposure time, intraoperative pain feeling score, visual analog scale, Oswestry Disability Index, and Macnab criteria score of the 2 groups. The mean follow-up period was 14 months. Result(s): The average cannula introduction time (16.50 +/- 3.29 minutes) and the radiation exposure time (40.71 +/- 6.23 seconds) in the ZESSYS group were significantly reduced compared with the TESSYS group (cannula introduction time, 20.06 +/- 3.37 minutes, P = 0.000; radiation exposure time, 49.20 +/- 7.84 seconds, P = 0.000). Intraoperative pain feeling score in the ZESSYS group was significantly improved compared with the TESSYS group (P = 0.021). There were no significant differences between the 2 groups for decompression time (P = 0.617), Macnab criteria (P = 0.769), or visual analog scale and Oswestry Disability Index scores at the same time point (P > 0.05). No serious complication was observed in any patients in either group. Conclusion(s): The novel targeted foraminoplasty technique with the specially designed double-cannulas is an effective and safe treatment for lumbar intervertebral disc herniation.

We hypothesized that the isotropic 0.5-mm CAC reconstruction outperforms the conventional 3.0-mm reconstruction in detecting and quantifying coronary calcium, and we proposed to compare them by validating against spatially registered intravascular ultrasound with radiofrequency backscatter-virtual histology (IVUS-VH)., MATERIALS AND METHODS: Twenty-seven patients were enrolled, and 5976 mm of coronary arteries were analyzed. A semiautomatic software was developed to coregister CAC and IVUS-VH on a detailed slice-by-slice basis. Calcium detection and calcium volume quantification were evaluated and compared using varying calcium attenuation thresholds. Algorithms for deriving individualized optimal threshold and comparable Agatston score on the 0.5-mm reconstruction were developed., RESULTS: The isotropic 0.5-mm reconstruction achieved significantly higher area under receiver-operating curve than the conventional 3.0-mm reconstruction (0.9 vs. 0.74, P < .001). Using the optimal threshold, the 0.5-mm reconstruction had higher sensitivity (0.79 vs. 0.65), specificity (0.85 vs. 0.77), positive predictive value (0.42 vs. 0.29), and negative predictive value (0.97 vs. 0.94) than the 3.0 mm. Individualized optimal threshold was significantly correlated with the image noise (r = 0.66, P < .001) in the 0.5-mm reconstruction., CONCLUSIONS: By optimizing the calcium threshold, the 0.5-mm reconstruction is superior to the conventional 3.0-mm in detecting and quantifying calcium, which may improve the clinical value of CAC without additional radiation.

Elevation in earliest reported BMI, BMI reported closest to colon cancer diagnosis, and time-varying BMI were associated with an elevated risk of colon cancer [relative risk (RR) per 5 kg/m(2) increase in BMI = 1.14, 95 % CI 1.03-1.26; RR = 1.16, 95 % CI 1.05-1.27; and RR = 1.15, 95 % CI 1.04-1.27, respectively]. Height was not significantly related to colon cancer risk. Inclusion of anthropometric variables in models had little impact on radiation risk estimates, and there was no evidence that sensitivity to the effect of radiation on colon cancer risk depended on BMI., CONCLUSIONS: Radiation exposure and BMI are both risk factors for colon cancer. BMI at various times after exposure to the atomic bombings does not significantly influence the relationship between radiation dose and colon cancer risk, suggesting that BMI and radiation impact colon cancer risk independently of each other.",Included

561,"Treatment outcomes of radiotherapy for tonsillar carcinoma in the era of intensity-modulated radiotherapy Background: We performed this study to analyze treatment outcomes and to evaluate prognostic factors in patients with tonsillar carcinoma who were treated with radiotherapy (RT). Material(s) and Method(s): We retrospectively reviewed 164 patients with tonsillar carcinoma treated with RT between January 1979 and September 2009. Of the 164 patients, 91 were treated with 2-dimensional RT (2D-RT), 46 were treated with 3-dimensional conformal RT (3D-CRT), and 27 were treated with intensity-modulated RT (IMRT). When patients were treated with IMRT, simultaneous integrated boost was used. Thirty patients were treated with RT alone, 40 patients were treated with chemotherapy and RT (CRT), 66 patients were treated with surgery and RT and/or chemotherapy (SRT), and 28 patients were treated with concurrent chemoradiotherapy (CCRT). Bilateral neck irradiation was delivered to 141 patients, and ipsilateral neck irradiation to 23 patients. In definitive RT, median dose was 70 Gy (range, 51-71), 70 Gy (54-74), and 67.5 Gy for 2D-RT, 3D-CRT, and IMRT, respectively. In postoperative RT, median dose was 64.8 Gy (range, 54-70.2), 66 Gy (54-70), and 63 Gy (60-67.5) for 2D-RT, 3D-CRT, and IMRT, respectively. Acute and late toxicity were graded according to the Radiation Therapy Oncology Group radiation morbidity scoring criteria. Result(s): The median follow-up time was 42 months (range, 2-288). The 5-year locoregional progression-free survival (LRPFS), distant metastasisfree survival (DMFS), disease-free survival (DFS), and overall survival (OS) rates were 86%, 94%, 82%, and 80%, respectively. In the univariate analysis, 5-year DFS rate was associated with the RT technique (2DRT, 77%; 3D-CRT, 82%; IMRT, 100%, p = 0.035), T stage (T1-2, 87%; T3-4, 74%, p = 0.036), and treatment modality (RT alone, 55%; CRT, 78%; SRT, 92%; CCRT, 92%, p < 0.0001). In the multivariate analysis, advanced T stage and treatment modality were statistically significant prognostic factors in DFS rate. None of the patients who were treated with ipsilateral neck irradiation experienced relapse in contralateral neck nodes. After the completion of RT, patients who were treated with 2D-RT, 3D-CRT, IMRT, ipsilateral neck irradiation, and bilateral neck irradiation experienced grade >=2 xerostomia 91%, 58%, 59%, 35%, and 78%, respectively. At least 6 months of follow-up, patients who were treated with 2D-RT, 3D-CRT, IMRT, ipsilateral neck irradiation, and bilateral neck irradiation experienced grade <=1 xerostomia 52%, 76%, 78%, 98%, and 63%, respectively. Conclusion(s): In selected patients with well lateralized tonsillar carcinoma, ipsilateral neck irradiation can be an alternative to bilateral neck irradiation, regarding DFS rate and complications. There was no failure when patients were treated with IMRT, but long-term follow-up is needed to evaluate the 72.0 Gy in 42 fractions/6 weeks). The primary endpoint was the treatment completion rate of patients who completed >= 70% of the cetuximab planned dose administration (in terms of the relative dose intensity of cetuximab) and the full dose of radiotherapy >= 2 weeks over the planned schedule (in terms of radiotherapy duration >=8 weeks). Result(s): From Mar 2009 until Jan 2010, 27 pts were screened. Of them, 22 pts were enrolled and treated (ITT population). Patients characteristics of ITT population: median age (years), 67.0 (range, 53 to 81); male/female, 21/1 pts; oropharynx/hypopharynx/larynx, 6/8/8 pts; stage III/IV, 12/10 pts. The median duration of cetuximab treatment was 7.9 weeks (range, 7 to 9), and that of RT was 44.0 days (range, 40 to 52). All 22 pts completed the treatment, and the completion rate was 100% (95% CI: 84.6%, 100.0%). The response rate (CR+PR) post RT was 81.8% (assessed by the independent committee). All pts experienced AEs. Most common AEs with grade 3/4 were mucosal inflammation (16pts, 72.7%), dermatitis (6pts, 27.3%), infection, radiation skin injury and stomatitis (each in 5 pts, 22.7%). Conclusion(s): The completion rate (100%) and the response rate (81.8%) are comparable to those of the cetuximab + RT group in the multinational randomized phase III study (Bonner et al. 2006). AEs were consistent with the underlying disease, administration of RT or cetuximab. The study results demonstrate that cetuximab + RT is well-tolerated, a feasible and efficacious treatment in Japanese pts. superiority of IMRT. Our results were not able to confirm which treatment regimen is most optimal. So, further study is needed to confirm the optimal therapeutic regimen.",Excluded
3117,"Association between trunk and leg fat and incidence of diabetes Background: General obesity defined by body mass index (BMI) is a major risk factor of diabetes mellitus (DM). Although body fat distribution is also considered to be a predictor of DM, only a few longitudinal studies have examined the association between DM risk and body composition, estimated directly using such methods as DEXA, in particular with reference to Asian populations who have a higher prevalence of DM at lower BMI levels compared with CaucAsians. Objective(s): To determine whether fat distribution is associated with DM incidence, independently of BMI, in an elderly Japanese population. Method(s): We analyzed 1,550 subjects without DM (472 men and 1,078 women, average age of 65.3 years) in the Adult Health Study, consisting of atomic bomb survivors and their controls, whose body composition was measured using DEXA during the period 1994-96. Fat-mass percentages for the trunk and legs were calculated by dividing each of the specific body partTMs fat mass by total soft tissue mass. DM was defined as glucose 126mg/dl fasting or 200mg/dl nonfasting, or physician-diagnosed DM, or the use of medication for DM. We followed-up through the end of 2011. Result(s): During a mean follow-up period of 11.4 years, 85 men and 110 women developed DM. Almost 20% of men and 28% of women were overweight/obese (BMI25kg/m2) at baseline. After multivariate analysis with adjustment made for age, metabolic syndrome risk factors other than central obesity, radiation dose, and smoking and alcohol consumption status, only overweight/obese women had a significant association with DM incidence compared with non-obese women (relative risk [RR] 1.52; 95% CI 1.01-2.27). Percentages of trunk fat and leg fat were associated with incidence of DM, independently of each other, after adjustment for age, BMI, and other risk factors. Increased percentage of trunk fat was a significant risk factor for incidence of DM; the RR for 1% increase in trunk fat were 1.13 (95% CI 1.06-1.20) in men and 1.08 (95% CI 1.02-1.14) in women, whereas, leg fat had protective effects regarding incidence of DM (men RR 0.83; 95% CI 0.71-0.96, women RR 0.87; 95% CI 0.79-0.95, for 1% increase in leg fat). These significant associations were observed for non-obese subjects. Conclusion(s): Trunk and leg fat were associated with incidence of DM, independently of each other. In addition to evaluation of general and abdominal obesity, the assessment of body fat distribution might also be useful in the prevention of DM.",Included
1026,"Osteoradionecrosis of the mandible after radiotherapy for head and neck cancer: risk factors and dose-volume correlations Background: The project aimed at determining the incidence of mandibular osteoradionecrosis (ORN) after radiotherapy, possible risk factors, and mandibular dose-volume effects in a large cohort of head and neck cancer patients (HNC). Methods: The cohort consisted of 1224 HNC patients treated with 66-68 Gy in 2007-2015 predominantly with IMRT. ORN cases were defined from clinical observations at follow-up and through hospital code diagnostics after oral-maxillofacial surgery and cross-checked with the national Danish Head and Neck Cancer database. In a nested case-control study, patients with ORN cases were matched with two controls (1:2) and pre-RT dental procedures including surgery to the mandible were documented. Multivariable Cox regression analysis was applied using demographic and treatment variables including dental procedures, smoking and tumor characteristics, and combined with dosimetric data. Mean mandibular dose (Dmean) was pre-selected for the multivariable model. Results: ORN was recorded in 56 cases (4.6%) with a median time to event of 10.9 months (range 1.8-89.7) after RT, 90% occurred within 37.4 months. Median follow-up time was 22 months (0.3-95). Average Dmean was significantly higher in the ORN event cohort and significant dose-volume differences were observed for population mean DVH doses between 30 Gy and 60 Gy. In univariable analysis, smoking (HR = 1.69; CI 1.14-2.5), pre-RT surgery/tooth extraction (HR = 2.76; 1.48-5.14), and several dosimetric parameters including Dmean (HR = 1.05, 1.02-1.08) were all significantly associated with ORN. Dmean and surgery/tooth extraction remained significant predictors of ORN in multivariable analysis, HR = 1.04 (CI 1.01-1.07) and HR = 2.09 (CI 1.1-3.98), respectively, while smoking only retained its significance in an interaction analysis with pre-RT dental procedures. Conclusion: The onset of ORN of the mandible was early (median 10.8 months) and the incidence low (4.6%) after IMRT in HNC cancer patients. Surgery to the mandible and pre-RT tooth extraction, tobacco smoking, and treatment dose were associated with the development of ORN.",Excluded
3081,"A review of forty-five years study of Hiroshima and Nagasaki atomic bomb survivors. Thyroid cancer: reports up to date and a review Evidence to date from a number of studies, indicates that there is an increased incidence of thyroid cancer among A-bomb survivors, and that the incidence rises with increase of dose and is especially predominant in females exposed at younger ages. Although 45 years have elapsed since A-bomb exposure, there are still some questions about the development of thyroid cancer: 1) Is the incidence now decreasing? 2) What factors, other than radiation exposure, are involved? 3) What is the incidence of multiple cancer, including thyroid cancer? With these questions in mind, it is apparent that studies in this field must continue for some time to come.",Included
2787,"Automatic, three-segment, MR-based attenuation correction for whole-body PET/MR data PURPOSE: The combination of positron emission tomography (PET) and magnetic resonance (MR) tomography in a single device is anticipated to be the next step following PET/CT for future molecular imaging application. Compared to CT, the main advantages of MR are versatile soft tissue contrast and its capability to acquire functional information without ionizing radiation. However, MR is not capable of measuring a physical quantity that would allow a direct derivation of the attenuation values for high-energy photons., METHODS: To overcome this problem, we propose a fully automated approach that uses a dedicated T1-weighted MR sequence in combination with a customized image processing technique to derive attenuation maps for whole-body PET. The algorithm automatically identifies the outer contour of the body and the lungs using region-growing techniques in combination with an intensity analysis for automatic threshold estimation. No user interaction is required to generate the attenuation map., RESULTS: The accuracy of the proposed MR-based attenuation correction (AC) approach was evaluated in a clinical study using whole-body PET/CT and MR images of the same patients (n = 15). The segmentation of the body and lung contour (L-R directions) was evaluated via a four-point scale in comparison to the original MR image (mean values >3.8). PET images were reconstructed using elastically registered MR-based and CT-based (segmented and non-segmented) attenuation maps. The MR-based AC showed similar behaviour as CT-based AC and similar accuracy as offered by segmented CT-based AC. Standardized uptake value (SUV) comparisons with reference to CT-based AC using predefined attenuation coefficients showed the largest difference for bone lesions (mean value +/- standard variation of SUV(max): -3.0% +/- 3.9% for MR; -6.5% +/- 4.1% for segmented CT). A blind comparison of PET images corrected with segmented MR-based, CT-based and segmented CT-based AC afforded identical lesion detectability, but slight differences in image quality were found., CONCLUSION: Our MR-based attenuation correction method offers similar correction accuracy as offered by segmented CT. According to the specialists involved in the blind study, these differences do not affect the diagnostic value of the PET images.",Excluded
2811,"Dose-dependent expression of CLIP2 in post-Chernobyl papillary thyroid carcinomas A previous study on papillary thyroid carcinomas (PTC) in young patients who were exposed to 131iodine from the Chernobyl fallout revealed an exclusive gain of chromosomal band 7q11.23 in exposed cases compared to an age-matched control cohort. CLIP2, a gene located within band 7q11.23 was shown to be differentially expressed between exposed and non-exposed cases at messenger RNA and protein level. Therefore, a standardized procedure for CLIP2 typing of PTCs has been developed in a follow-up study. Here we used CLIP2 typing data on 117 post-Chernobyl PTCs from two cohorts of exposed patients with individual dose estimates and 24 non-exposed controls to investigate a possible quantitative dose-response relationship of the CLIP2 marker. The 'Genrisk-T' cohort consisted of 45 PTCs and the 'UkrAm' cohort of 72 PTCs. Both cohorts differed in mean dose (0.59 Gy Genrisk-T, 1.2 Gy UkrAm) and mean age at exposure (AaE) (2 years Genrisk-T, 8 years UkrAm), whilst the median latency (16 years Genrisk-T, 18 years UkrAm) was comparable. We analyzed the association between the binary CLIP2 typing and continuous thyroid dose with logistic regression. A clear positive dose-response relationship was found for young PTC cases [age at operation (AaO) < 20 years, AaE < 5 years]. In the elder age group a higher proportion of sporadic tumors is assumed due to a negligible dose response, suggesting different molecular mechanisms in sporadic and radiation-induced cases. This is further supported by the association of elder patients (AaO > 20 years) with positivity for BRAF V600E mutation.Copyright © The Author 2015. Published by Oxford University Press.

117,"Risk Factors for Keratinocyte Carcinoma in Recipients of Allogeneic Hematopoietic Cell Transplants Importance: Allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplant (alloHCT) is known to increase the risk for keratinocyte carcinoma. The extent to which host characteristics, including pigmentary phenotype and UV radiation exposure, contribute is unknown., Objective: To identify and validate independent risk factors for keratinocyte carcinoma after alloHCT, including those associated with the transplant and the host., Design, Setting, and Participants: This retrospective cohort study analyzed a consecutive sample of alloHCT recipients from January 1, 2000, to December 31, 2014, at the Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota (n = 872) and University Hospitals Cleveland Medical Center, Cleveland, Ohio (n = 147). Participants from the Mayo Clinic were randomly allocated (2:1) into discovery (n = 581) and validation (n = 291) cohorts. Time to first keratinocyte carcinoma and information about transplant- and host-associated risk factors were extracted. A multivariate keratinocyte carcinoma risk model was created using a stepwise Cox proportional hazards regression model with P <= .05 for entry that incorporated all covariates that were individually statistically significant at alpha = 0.05 in the discovery cohort. The risk model was first internally validated using the Mayo Clinic validation cohort and then externally validated using the independent cohort of alloHCT recipients at University Hospitals Cleveland Medical Center. Data were analyzed from March 13, 2018, to June 12, 2019., Exposures: Allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplant., Main Outcomes and Measures: The primary outcome was time to development of the first cutaneous keratinocyte carcinoma after alloHCT; secondary outcome, time to development of the first individual basal and/or squamous cell carcinoma after alloHCT., Results: Of the 872 alloHCT recipients identified in the Mayo Clinic cohort (520 men [59.6%]; mean [SD] age, 48.3 [12.6] years), 95 (10.9%) developed keratinocyte carcinoma after alloHCT during 5349 person-years of follow-up. Of the 147 alloHCT recipients in the exernal validation cohort (86 men [58.5%]; mean [SD] age, 47.9 [17.5] years), 18 (12.2%) developed keratinocyte carcinoma after alloHCT in 880 person-years of follow up. Risk factors independently associated with keratinocyte carcinoma after alloHCT included age (hazard ratio [HR] per 10 years, 1.72; 95% CI, 1.21-2.42), chronic lymphocytic leukemia (HR, 2.47; 95% CI, 1.20-5.09), clinically photodamaged skin (HR, 3.47; 95% CI, 1.87-6.41), and history of cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (HR, 2.60; 95% CI, 1.41-5.91). Harrell concordance statistics were 0.81 (95% CI, 0.72-0.90) and 0.86 (95% CI, 0.74-0.98) for internal and external validation of the keratinocyte carcinoma risk model, respectively., Conclusions and Relevance: This study found validated independent risk factors for keratinocyte carcinoma after alloHCT that are enriched with host- compared with transplant-associated risk factors. These findings highlight the importance of assessing host-associated risk factors for keratinocyte carcinoma in patients eligible for alloHCT. Future studies should examine whether keratinocyte carcinoma risk stratification before alloHCT may inform long-term surveillance strategies.",Excluded
3099,"Acute phase response before treatment predicts radiation esophagitis in non-small cell lung cancer BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Radiation esophagitis (RE) represents an inflammatory reaction to radiation therapy (RT). We hypothesized that aspects of the physiologic acute phase response (APR) predicts RE., MATERIAL AND METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed 285 patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) treated with definitive radiation. The primary analysis was the association of pretreatment lab values reflective of the APR with symptomatic (grade 2) RE. Univariate and multivariate odds ratios (ORs) were calculated to test associations of clinical and pretreatment lab values with RE. Optimal cutpoints and multivariable risk stratification groupings were determined via recursive partitioning analysis., RESULTS: Pretreatment platelet counts were higher and hemoglobin levels lower in patients who developed RE (P<0.05). Based on these two pre-treatment risk factors, an APR score was defined as 0 (no risk factors), 1 (either risk factor), or 2 (both risk factors). APR score was significantly associated with RE in both univariate (OR = 2.3 for each point, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.5-3.4, P = 0.001) and multivariate (OR = 2.1, 95% CI 1.3-3.4, P = 0.002) analyses., CONCLUSIONS: The APR score may represent a novel metric to predict RE. However, pending validation in an independent dataset, caution is advised when interpreting these results given their retrospective and thus exploratory nature. Copyright © 2014 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

3453,"Phase II trial of induction gemcitabine and carboplatin followed by conformal thoracic radiation to 74 Gy with weekly paclitaxel and carboplatin in unresectable stage III non-small cell lung cancer Introduction: The survival for patients with locally advanced, unresectable non-small cell lung cancer receiving standard of care concomitant chemoradiation remains disappointingly low. A reduction in both local and distant recurrence is needed to improve patients' outcome. Performing molecular studies on serially collected tumor specimens may result in a better selection of therapeutic options. Method(s): We conducted a phase II single-institution trial of two cycles of induction chemotherapy with gemcitabine and carboplatin followed by high-dose conformal radiation concomitant with weekly paclitaxel and carboplatin in 39 patients. The trial required a dedicated tumor biopsy before treatment initiation. In addition, tumor biopsies were requested, if safely feasible, before initiation of chemoradiation and 2 months after completion all therapy. Result(s): Induction chemotherapy was well tolerated, and 38 patients proceeded with chemoradiation. The mean delivered radiation dose was 70.2 Gy, 23 patients received the full dose of 74 Gy, and 19 patients completed all treatment on schedule without dose reductions or delays. Median overall and progression-free survivals were 22.7 and 14.3 months, respectively. A total of 82 procedures, including 46 transthoracic core needle biopsies, were performed. Thirteen patients had all three serial tumor biopsies. Three of these procedures resulted in complications that required an intervention; all for the treatment of a biopsy-induced pneumothorax. Conclusion(s): We conclude that induction gemcitabine/carboplatin followed by concurrent paclitaxel/carboplatin with conformal radiation to 74 Gy is safe and tolerable with promising efficacy. We demonstrated that dedicated and serial tumor collections are safe, feasible, and acceptable for patients with non-small cell lung cancer.

1575,"Outcomes of surgical management of peptic ulcer perforation using the falciform ligament: A cross-sectional study at a single centre in Vietnam Introduction: Peptic ulcer perforation (PUP) is one of the most common critical surgical emergencies. The omentum flap is commonly used to cover a PUP. However, the omentum cannot be used in cases of severe peritonitis or previous surgical removal. This is the first study conducted in Vietnam that was designed to analyse the outcomes of patients with PUPs who were treated using the falciform ligament. Method(s): In this study, we retrospectively identified 40 consecutive patients who were treated for PUP at a single high-volume centre in Vietnam from February 2018 to February 2021. Peptic ulcer perforation was measured during diagnostic evaluation based on preoperative imaging, such as X-ray, and CT scan. Patients who had malignancy, laparoscopic surgery, omentopexy and nonoperative treatment were excluded from this research. Result(s): Forty patients were included; the mean age of the patients was 66.3 years (range 33-99 years), and some patients had comorbid disease (57.5%), hypertension (30%), diabetes (10%), cirrhosis (7.5%), and chronic renal failure (7.5%). The PUPs were located in the duodenum (80%), or the pyloric (15%) and prepyloric (5%) regions. The procedures used to treat the patients included duodenostomy (32.5%), gastrojejunostomy (37.5%), and antrum resection (2.5%). The average operative time was 88.6 min (45-180 min), hospital stay was 9.6 days (2-35 days), and oral intake was started at 4.1 days (3-8 days); additionally, the 30-day mortality (17.5%) and incidences of pneumonia (25%), multiorgan failure (15%), acute liver failure (5%), wound infection (7.5%), and ulcer peptic fistula (0%) were assessed. Univariate tests showed that an ASA >= III and comorbidities, such as pulmonary complications, liver failure and multiorgan failure, were associated with mortality. The multivariate test showed that multiorgan failure was the only factor related to mortality. Conclusion(s): The falciform ligament can be efficiently used for the closure of a PUP. Although there were no instances of complication with a reperforated peptic ulcer, the mortality rate was slightly highly related to severe comorbidities and postoperative multiorgan failure.Copyright © 2021",Excluded

Despite decades of epidemiologic study, the known and suspected risk factors for leukemia are insufficient to explain more than a small fraction of the observed variation in the occurrence of the leukemias. Important contributions to the literature in 1993 included studies further clarifying the role of known risk factors (ionizing radiation, certain chemotherapeutic agents, and specific occupational chemical exposures) and suspected risk factors (infectious agents, electromagnetic fields, cigarette smoking, other chemotherapeutic agents, and additional occupational chemical exposures) in leukemogenesis.",Excluded

1953,"The thermal effects of therapeutic lasers with 810 and 904 nm wavelengths on human skin OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effect of therapeutic infrared class 3B laser irradiation on skin temperature in healthy participants of differing skin color, age, and gender., BACKGROUND: Little is known about the potential thermal effects of Low Level Laser Therapy (LLLT) irradiation on human skin., METHODS: Skin temperature was measured in 40 healthy volunteers with a thermographic camera at laser irradiated and control (non-irradiated) areas on the skin. Six irradiation doses (2-12 J) were delivered from a 200 mW, 810 nm laser and a 60 mW, 904 nm laser, respectively., RESULTS: Thermal effects of therapeutic LLLT using doses recommended in the World Association for Laser Therapy (WALT) guidelines were insignificant; below 1.5degreeC in light, medium, and dark skin. When higher irradiation doses were used, the 60 mW, 904 nm laser produced significantly (p < 0.01) higher temperatures in dark skin (5.7, SD +/- 1.8degreeC at 12 J) than in light skin, although no participants requested termination of LLLT. However, irradiation with a 200 mW, 810 nm laser induced three to six times more heat in dark skin than in the other skin color groups. Eight of 13 participants with dark skin asked for LLLT to be stopped because of uncomfortable heating. The maximal increase in skin temperature was 22.3degreeC., CONCLUSIONS: The thermal effects of LLLT at doses recommended by WALT-guidelines for musculoskeletal and inflammatory conditions are negligible (<1.5degreeC) in light, medium, and dark skin. However, higher LLLT doses delivered with a strong 3B laser (200 mW) are capable of increasing skin temperature significantly and these photothermal effects may exceed the thermal pain threshold for humans with dark skin color.",Excluded
3489,"Design of a motion simulation system to assist respiratory gating for radiation therapy Stereotactic ablative radiotherapy (SABR) aims to deliver high doses of radiation to kill cancer cells and shrink tumors in less than or equal to 6 fractions. However, organ motion during treatment is a challenging issue for this kind of technique. We develop a control system via Bluetooth technology to simulate and correct body motion during SABR. Method(s): Radiation doses were analyzed, and the radiation damage protection capability was checked by external beam therapy 3 (EBT3) films irradiated by a linear accelerator. A wireless signal test was also performed. A validation was performed with 8 previously treated patient respiratory pattern records and 8 healthy volunteers. Result(s): The homemade simulation system consisted of 2 linear actuators, one movable stage with a maximal moving distance of 6.5 cm x 12.5 cm x 5 cm to simulate the respiratory pattern of 8 patients precisely with a median error of 0.36 mm and a maximal motion difference of 1.17 mm, and 3.17 and chipset transited signals to display them as a waveform. From the test with 8 volunteers, the chip could detect deep respiratory movement up to 3 cm. The effect of the chip on a radiation dose of 400 monitor units (MUs) by 6 MV photons and 200 MUs by 10 MV photons showed high penetration rates of 98.8% and 98.6%, respectively. Conclusion(s): We invented a tubeless and wireless respiratory gating detection chip. The chip has minimal interference with the treatment angles, good noise immunity and the capability to easily penetrate a variety of materials. The simulation system consisting of linear actuators also successfully simulates the respiratory pattern of real patients.Copyright © 2021 American Association of Medical Dosimetrists",Excluded
2726,"Occupational ionising radiation and risk of basal cell carcinoma in US radiologic technologists (1983-2005) OBJECTIVE: To determine risk for incident basal cell carcinoma from cumulative low-dose ionising radiation in the US radiologic technologist cohort., METHODS: We analysed 65,719 Caucasian technologists who were cancer-free at baseline (1983-1989 or 1994-1998) and answered a follow-up questionnaire (2003-2005). Absorbed radiation dose to the skin in mGy for estimated cumulative occupational radiation exposure was reconstructed for each technologist based on badge dose measurements, questionnaire-derived work history and protection practices, and literature information. Radiation-associated risk was assessed using Poisson regression and included adjustment for several demographic, lifestyle, host and sun exposure factors., RESULTS: Cumulative mean absorbed skin dose (to head/neck/arms) was 55.8 mGy (range 0-1735 mGy). For lifetime cumulative dose, we did not observe an excess radiation-related risk (excess relative risk/Gy=-0.01 (95% CI -0.43 to 0.52). However, we observed that basal cell carcinoma risk was increased for radiation dose received before age 30 (excess relative risk/Gy=0.59, 95% CI -0.11 to 1.42) and before 1960 (excess relative risk/Gy=2.92, 95% CI 1.39 to 4.45)., CONCLUSIONS: Basal cell carcinoma risk was unrelated to low-dose radiation exposure among radiologic technologists. Because of uncertainties in dosimetry and sensitivity to model specifications, both our null results and our findings of excess risk for dose received before age 30 and exposure before 1960 should be interpreted with caution.

2340,"Development of radiation exposure in patients undergoing pulmonary vein isolation in Germany between 2007 and 2014: great potential to minimize radiation dosage AIM: The aim of this study was to analyze the radiation usage in patients undergoing pulmonary vein isolation (PVI) in Germany and to evaluate the possibility to reduce radiation dose., METHODS AND RESULTS: A total of 6617 patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) from the German ablation registry and the FREEZEplus registry (control group), who underwent first PVI between 2007 and 2014, were analyzed. In the second step, the effect of optimized conventional fluoroscopy and optimized 3D mapping use was evaluated in 526 consecutive patients with AF who underwent first PVI at the Klinikum Ludwigshafen (optimized group) between 2007 and 2014. In the control group, the median dose area product (DAP) for PVI was 34 Gy cm(2), and the median DAP rate was 1.3 Gy cm(2)/min. The DAP decreased from 37 to 28 Gy cm(2), whereas the DAP rate increased from 1.3 to 1.6 Gy cm(2)/min between 2007 and 2014. In the optimized group, optimized radiation application and use of 3D mapping resulted in a continuous decrease in the DAP from 67 to 2 Gy cm(2) and DAP rate from 1.0 to 0.2 Gy cm(2)/min., CONCLUSION: Currently, the median radiation exposure during PVI in Germany is 28 Gy cm(2). Optimized fluoroscopy by simple means can safely reduce the radiation dose to about 2 Gy cm(2) or even lower when using 3D mapping. Before introducing novel expensive technologies for radiation reduction optimizing of the conventional fluoroscopy is mandatory.",Excluded
2044,"Radiation- and Age-Associated Changes in Peripheral Blood Dendritic Cell Populations among Aging Atomic Bomb Survivors in Japan Previous immunological studies in atomic bomb survivors have suggested that radiation exposure leads to long-lasting changes, similar to immunological aging observed in T-cell-adaptive immunity. However, to our knowledge, late effects of radiation on dendritic cells (DCs), the key coordinators for activation and differentiation of T cells, have not yet been investigated in humans. In the current study, we hypothesized that numerical and functional decreases would be observed in relationship to radiation dose in circulating conventional DCs (cDCs) and plasmacytoid DCs (pDCs) among 229 Japanese A-bomb survivors. Overall, the evidence did not support this hypothesis, with no overall changes in DCs or functional changes observed with radiation dose. Multivariable regression analysis for radiation dose, age and gender effects revealed that total DC counts as well as subpopulation counts decreased in relationship to increasing age. Further analyses revealed that in women, absolute numbers of pDCs showed significant decreases with radiation dose. A hierarchical clustering analysis of gene expression profiles in DCs after Toll-like receptor stimulation in vitro identified two clusters of participants that differed in age-associated expression levels of genes involved in antigen presentation and cytokine/chemokine production in cDCs. These results suggest that DC counts decrease and expression levels of gene clusters change with age. More than 60 years after radiation exposure, we also observed changes in pDC counts associated with radiation, but only among women.",Included

3132,"Why to start the concomitant boost in accelerated radiotherapy for advanced laryngeal cancer in week 3 PURPOSE: We analyzed toxicity and the local control rates for advanced laryngeal cancer, treated with two accelerated fractionation schedules. The main difference between the schedules was the onset of the concomitant boost, in Week 3 or Week 4. Overall treatment time and total dose were equivalent., METHODS AND MATERIALS: In a prospective, nonrandomized study of T3, T4, and advanced T2 laryngeal cancer, concomitant boost schedules were used in 100 patients. Thirty patients received a schedule of twice daily 1.2 Gy in Weeks 1-3, followed by twice daily 1.7 Gy in Weeks 4 and 5; total dose was 70 Gy (the hyperfractionated accelerated schedule [HAS] regimen). Seventy patients were treated with 5 times 2 Gy in Weeks 1 and 2, followed by daily 1.8 Gy and 1.5 Gy (boost) in Weeks 3-5; total dose 69.5 Gy (the accelerated schedule only [ASO] regimen). Distribution of T stage was 47%, 40%, and 12% for T2, T3, and T4, respectively. In 24% of the patients, lymph nodes were positive. Pretreatment tracheotomy or stridor or both occurred in 8 patients. The distribution of prognostic factors was not significantly different between the two fractionation schedules. Acute and late toxicity was assessed. Results were estimated by the use of actuarial methods. For late toxicity and local control univariate and multivariate analyses were performed. Tumor control probability analysis was used to model cure rate differences., RESULTS: Overall acute mucositis score was equal for both schedules. Acute mucositis started and decreased significantly earlier in the HAS regimen. In all patients acute mucositis healed completely. The treatment was completed within 38 days in all patients. The regional control rate was 100% for clinical N0, and 75% for the clinical N+ patients. The 3-year local control rate was 59% and 78% for the HAS and ASO regimens, respectively (p = 0.05); the ultimate local control was 80% and 94%, respectively. In multivariate analysis, besides the fractionation schedule (relative risk [RR], 2.6 for HAS vs. ASO), pretreatment tracheotomy/stridor (RR 4.3, yes vs. no), and local tumor response 3-6 weeks after radiotherapy (RR 5.1, no vs. yes) were independent factors for local control. Tumor control probability analysis indicated that the onset of repopulation may be about 4-6 days earlier for the HAS regimen. The onset of repopulation in the HAS regimen is probably at the end of the second week or at the beginning of the third week. Severe late toxicity was observed in the HAS group and ASO group in, respectively, 11% and 16%. In multivariate analysis this toxicity related significantly to the field size and pretreatment tracheotomy/stridor., CONCLUSIONS: In our study the timing of the boost in accelerated radiotherapy for advanced laryngeal cancer was an independent factor for local control, favoring the use of a concomitant boost in Week 3. This finding may indicate that accelerated repopulation of tumor cells starts early in the treatment phase.",Excluded

660,"A little to a lot or a lot to a little? An analysis of pneumonitis risk from dose-volume histogram parameters of the lung in patients with lung cancer treated with 3-D conformal radiotherapy PURPOSE: To determine whether a little dose to a large normal lung volume or a high dose to a small lung volume is more critical for induction of clinical pneumonitis. The second question is if dose-volume histogram (DVH) parameters are more reliable, if the lungs are analyzed as separate organs or as a whole organ., PATIENTS AND METHODS: We analyzed the clinical and DVH data from 49 patients treated for a thoracic malignancy using 3-D conformal treatment plans. 18 patients had developed a clinical pneumonitis (CTC II or III). The majority of patients (n = 48) received radiochemotherapy for non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with a combination of paclitaxel and carboplatin. Patients were generally treated 5 fx/week, single dose 2 Gy, using a two-series approach (shrinking field) up to a total dose of 60-70 Gy. For every individual patient, the overall dose distribution was recalculated in the Helax-TMS by means of adding dose plans according to the total dose applied in each series. The lungs were defined both as separate organs and as a whole organ. Low-dose volume ( 10-40 Gy, Vmod) and high-dose volume (> 40 Gy, Vhigh), as well as V10-V40 and mean lung dose (MLD) were defined from the cumulative DVH. Dose-effect relationships were fitted with a logistic regression model., RESULTS: Manifestation of clinical pneumonitis was within 3 months from termination of irradiation in all cases. For the ipsilateral lung, the incidence of pneumonitis was closely correlated to Vhigh. The pneumonitis rate increased from 13% up to 60%. By contrast, with increasing Vlow the pneumonitis rate dropped to < 10%. A similar but less pronounced effect was seen for the total lung. The lung volumes Vlow, Vmod and Vhigh of the ipsilateral, contralateral and whole lung were significantly correlated to the corresponding MLD. The incidence of pneumonitis increased with increasing MLD for the ipsilateral lung with a D50 of 32 Gy and a gamma 50 of 0.98. For the whole lung, the observed increase was less steep. MLD showed a close correlation to NTCP calculated by the Kutcher model. However, NTCP calculation overestimated the pneumonitis risk for the ipsilateral lung and underestimated the risk for the whole lung due to the steeper gradient. The logistic regression curve for the DVH parameters V10-V40 showed an increase of steepness toward higher doses. From the logistic regression curves, a DVH template indicating critical borders of V10-V40 was generated for the ipsilateral as well as for the total lung., CONCLUSION: Our data indicate that it is reasonable to disperse the dose outside the target volume over large areas in order to reduce the volumes of lung receiving > 40 Gy. Reducing the high-dose volume reduces the pneumonitis rate more than a corresponding reduction in the low-dose regions of the DVH. Landmarks for DVH optimization as defined in this analysis may serve as a basis for DVH contrains in IMRT planning. Separate organ analysis produced more reliable results and should be preferred to whole-organ analysis, if techniques mainly involving one side of the lung are applied. Further validation of these constraints is necessary prior to general recommendation.",Excluded
3242,"Cardiac and Renal Delayed Effects of Acute Radiation Exposure: Organ Differences in Vasculopathy, Inflammation, Senescence and Oxidative Balance We have previously shown significant pathology in the heart and kidney of murine hematopoietic-acute radiation syndrome (H-ARS) survivors of 8.7-9.0 Gy total-body irradiation (TBI). The goal of this study was to determine temporal relationships in the development of vasculopathy and the progression of renal and cardiovascular delayed effects of acute radiation exposure (DEARE) at TBI doses less than 9 Gy and to elucidate the potential roles of senescence, inflammation and oxidative stress. Our results show significant loss of endothelial cells in coronary arteries by 4 months post-TBI (8.53 or 8.72 Gy of gamma radiation). This loss precedes renal dysfunction and interstitial fibrosis and progresses to abnormalities in the arterial media and adventitia and loss of coronary arterioles. Major differences in radiation-induced pathobiology exist between the heart and kidney in terms of vasculopathy progression and also in indices of inflammation, senescence and oxidative imbalance. The results of this work suggest a need for different medical countermeasures for multiple targets in different organs and at various times after acute radiation injury to prevent the progression of DEARE.",Included
1683,"The impact of margin reduction on outcome and toxicity in head and neck cancer patients treated with image-guided volumetric modulated arc therapy (VMAT) Background and purpose: In recent decades, outcomes of patients with head and neck cancer (HNC) have improved as a result of implementing several strategies, such as chemoradiation. However, these improvements were achieved at the cost of increased toxicity. One way to reduce radiation-related toxicity is by reducing the margins. Material(s) and Method(s): Between 2013 and 2016, 206 consecutive patients were treated with CTV-PTV margin of 5 mm and subsequently 208 patients with 3 mm margin. This study evaluates the impact of reducing clinical target volume (CTV) to planning target volume (PTV) margin on outcome and toxicity. Result(s): All patients were treated with volumetric modulated arc therapy (VMAT) with daily-image guidance using cone-beam CT (CBCT). Overall acute grade 3 toxicity was significantly lower in 3 mm-group, compared to 5 mm-group (53.8% vs. 65%, respectively, p = 0.032). The same was true for acute grade 3 mucositis (30.8% vs. 42.2%, p = 0.008) and for acute grade 3 dysphagia (feeding tube-dependence) (22.1% vs. 33.5%, p = 0.026). The incidence of ongoing feeding tube-dependence after 3 months of radiotherapy was 11.1% and 20.4%, respectively (p = 0.012). The 2-year incidence of late grade >=2 xerostomia was 15.8% and 19.4% (p = 0.8). The 2-year loco-regional control rates of patients treated in 3 mm and 5 mm-groups were 79.9% and 79.2% (p = 1.0). The figures for disease-free survival were 71.5% and 72.7 (p = 0.6) and for overall survival were 75.2% and 75.1% (p = 0.9).

1824,"Gluteus maximus turnover flap for sacral osteomyelitis after radiation therapy Developments in radiation therapy modalities offer alternative treatments for un-resectable malignant tumors in the pelvis and trunk. However, poor vascularity as a result of radiation therapy makes the treated lesion susceptible to infection, and there are no established treatments for pelvic osteomyelitis with a large dead space after radiation therapy. The authors report 2 cases of sacral osteomyelitis after radiation therapy that were treated successfully with a gluteus maximus turnover flap. To create the flap, the distal portion of the lower third of the muscle was detached from the trochanter. The distal edge of the flap was turned toward the sacral defect and sewn to the remnant of the sacrum, which filled the dead space with the muscle bulk. A 68-year-old man with a recurrent sacral chordoma was treated with carbon ion radiation therapy; however, a sacral infection developed 5 months later. De-bridement and a course of antibiotics could not control the infection and did not induce sufficient formation of granulation tissue in the large and deep dead space. The turnover flap with both gluteus maximus muscles cured the deep-seated infec-tion and closed the wound. A 58-year-old woman had sacral osteoradionecrosis with infection. A turnover flap created with the left gluteus maximus muscle controlled the infection and closed the wound after the first operation, a V-Y flap, failed. This study showed that a gluteus maximus muscle turnover flap effectively controlled infectious lesions with large and deep dead space around the sacrum.Copyright © SLACK Incorporated.",Excluded

The maximum eye lens dose of 1492 mGy was measured at LOC region for an AVM case, followed by 907 mGy for an aneurysm case and 665 mGy for a diagnostic angiography procedure. Strong correlations (shown as R(2)) were observed between kerma-area-product and measured eye doses (LOC: 0.78, LE: 0.68). Lateral and frontal air-kerma showed strong correlations with measured dose at LOC (AKL: 0.93, AKF: 0.78) and a weak correlation with measured dose at LE. A moderate correlation was observed between fluoroscopic time and dose measured at LE and LOC regions., CONCLUSIONS: The MOSkin dose-monitoring system represents a new tool enabling real-time monitoring of eye lens dose during neuro-interventional procedures. This system can provide interventionalists with information needed to adjust the clinical procedure to control the patient's dose., KEY POINTS: Real-time patient dose monitoring helps interventionalists to monitor doses.

2373,"Parasympathetic stimulation improves epithelial organ regeneration Parasympathetic nerves are a vital component of the progenitor cell niche during development, maintaining a pool of progenitors for organogenesis. Injured adult organs do not regenerate after parasympathectomy, and there are few treatments to improve organ regeneration, particularly after damage by therapeutic irradiation. Here we show that restoring parasympathetic function with the neurotrophic factor neurturin increases epithelial organ regeneration after damage. We use mouse salivary gland explant culture containing fluorescently labelled progenitors, and injure the tissue with irradiation. The progenitors survive, parasympathetic function is diminished and epithelial apoptosis reduces the expression of neurturin, which increases neuronal apoptosis. Treatment with neurturin reduces neuronal apoptosis, restores parasympathetic function and increases epithelial regeneration. Furthermore, adult human salivary glands damaged by irradiation also have reduced parasympathetic innervation. We propose that neurturin will protect the parasympathetic nerves from damage and improve organ regeneration. This concept may be applicable for other organs where parasympathetic innervation influences their function.",Excluded

Toxicities were evaluated using Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events v 3.0. Result(s): The median follow-up was 19.6 months (range: 4.0-128.8 months). Median local failure free survival was 19.6 months (95% confidence interval [CI]: 14.4-28.8 months); and median overall survival was 21.2 months (95% CI: 14.9-29.3 months). Analysis of competing risks showed that at 5 years, the probability of local failure as the first detected event was 22.1% (95% CI: 12.8%-32.9%); the probability of distal failure as the first detected event was 14.5% (95% CI: 7.3%-24.0%); and the probability of death without recording a failure was 48.6% (95% CI: 36.1%-60.1%). Radiation-related toxicity of grade 3 or greater was seen in 3 patients and there were no treatment-related deaths. Conclusion(s): Hypofractionated radiotherapy is an effective, safe treatment for older patients with stage I non-small-cell lung cancer. Copyright © 2011 by Lippincott Williams & Wilkins.",Excluded
576,"Cervical lymph node involvement in carcinomas of the mobile tongue in Tunisia. Retrospective study of 135 cases OBJECTIVE: To report the profile of histologic cervical nodes involvement associated with mobile tongue squamous cell carcinoma. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Our retrospective study concerned patients treated from 1978 to 1998 by cervical neck dissection for mobile tongue carcinoma. RESULT(S): A population of 135 patients (90 M/45 F, sex-ratio 2) with a 53.5 mean age (19 to 75) is analyzed. Clinical palpable nodes were present in 68 cases (50%) mainly submental-submaxillar (54). Histologic examination showed a node involvement in 54 cases without (32 cases) or with capsular rupture (22 cases) mainly in the jugulo-carotidian chain (46/54). Among the 67 clinically N0 patients collected after 1990, 22 patients (33%) exhibited an histological involvement vs 32/68 (47%) for the group presenting palpable cervical nodes for the whole period. Histologic node involvement seemed to be linked to the clinical status, node size and TNM stage. CONCLUSION(S): Cervical lymph node treatment needs to be systematic in mobile tongue carcinoma. The probability of histologic involvement is linked to the loco-regional extent of disease and influences the prognosis. In N0 patients, neck dissection is required because of the frequency of histological involvement, particularly when loss to follow-up may be expected.",Excluded
3663,"TWO FACTORS INFLUENCING DOSE RECONSTRUCTION IN LOW DOSE RANGE: THE VARIABILITY OF BKG INTENSITY ON ONE INDIVIDUAL AND WATER CONTENT A fast and accurate retrospective dosimetry method for the triage is very important in radiation accidents. Electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) fingernail dosimetry is a promising way to estimate radiation dose. This article presents two factors influencing dose reconstruction in low dose range: the variability of background signal (BKG) intensity on one individual and water content. Comparing the EPR spectrum of dried and humidified fingernail samples, it is necessary to add a procedure of dehydration before EPR measurements, so as to eliminate the deviation caused by water content. Besides, the BKGs of different fingers' nails are not the same as researchers thought previously, and the difference between maximum and minimum BKG intensities of one individual can reach 55.89 %. Meanwhile, the variability of the BKG intensity among individuals is large enough to impact precise dose reconstruction. Water within fingernails and instability of BKG are two reasons that cause the inaccuracy of radiation dose reconstruction in low-dosage level.Copyright © The Author 2015.

2400,"Feasibility of wall stress analysis of abdominal aortic aneurysms using three-dimensional ultrasound OBJECTIVE: Abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAAs) are local dilations that can lead to a fatal hemorrhage when ruptured. Wall stress analysis of AAAs is a novel tool that has proven high potential to improve risk stratification. Currently, wall stress analysis of AAAs is based on computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging; however, three-dimensional (3D) ultrasound (US) has great advantages over CT and magnetic resonance imaging in terms of costs, speed, and lack of radiation. In this study, the feasibility of 3D US as input for wall stress analysis is investigated. Second, 3D US-based wall stress analysis was compared with CT-based results., METHODS: The 3D US and CT data were acquired in 12 patients (diameter, 35-90 mm). US data were segmented manually and compared with automatically acquired CT geometries by calculating the similarity index and Hausdorff distance. Wall stresses were simulated at P = 140 mm Hg and compared between both modalities., RESULTS: The similarity index of US vs CT was 0.75 to 0.91 (n = 12), with a median Hausdorff distance ranging from 4.8 to 13.9 mm, with the higher values found at the proximal and distal sides of the AAA. Wall stresses were in accordance with literature, and a good agreement was found between US- and CT-based median stresses and interquartile stresses, which was confirmed by Bland-Altman and regression analysis (n = 8). Wall stresses based on US were typically higher (+23%), caused by geometric irregularities due to the registration of several 3D volumes and manual segmentation. In future work, an automated US registration and segmentation approach is the essential point of improvement before pursuing large-scale patient studies., CONCLUSIONS: This study is a first step toward US-based wall stress analysis, which would be the modality of choice to monitor wall stress development over time because no ionizing radiation and contrast material are involved.

711,"Detectability of radiation-induced changes in magnetic resonance biomarkers following stereotactic radiosurgery: A pilot study Our objective was to investigate direct voxel-wise relationship between dose and early MR biomarker changes both within and in the high-dose region surrounding brain metastases following stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS). Specifically, we examined the apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) from diffusion-weighted imaging and the contrast transfer coefficient (Ktrans) and volume of extracellular extravascular space (ve) derived from dynamic contrast-enhanced (DCE) MRI data. We investigated 29 brain metastases in 18 patients using 3 T MRI to collect imaging data at day 0, day 3 and day 20 following SRS. The ADC maps were generated by the scanner and Ktrans and ve maps were generated using in-house software for dynamic tracer-kinetic analysis. To enable spatially-correlated voxel-wise analysis, we developed a registration pipeline to register all ADC, Ktrans and ve maps to the planning MRI scan. To interrogate longitudinal changes, we computed absolute DELTAADC, DELTAKtrans and DELTAve for day 3 and 20 post-SRS relative to day 0. We performed a Kruskall-Wallice test on each biomarker between time points and investigated dose correlations within the gross tumour volume (GTV) and surrounding high dose region > 12 Gy via Spearman's rho. Only ve exhibited significant differences between day 0 and 20 (p < 0.005) and day 3 and 20 (p < 0.05) within the GTV following SRS. Strongest dose correlations were observed for ADC within the GTV (rho = 0.17 to 0.20) and weak correlations were observed for ADC and Ktrans in the surrounding > 12 Gy region. Both DELTAKtrans and DELTAve showed a trend with dose at day 20 within the GTV and > 12 Gy region (rho = -0.04 to -0.16). Weak dose-related decreases in Ktrans and ve within the GTV and high dose region at day 20 most likely reflect underlying vascular responses to radiation. Our study also provides a voxel-wise analysis schema for future MR biomarker studies with the goal of elucidating surrogates for radionecrosis.",Excluded
123,"Multivariate logistic regression analysis of the prognostic factors for 840 patients with nasopharyngeal carcinoma Objective: To investigate the prognostic factors for patients with nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) who received radiotherapy (RT) and to provide information about improvement in NPC RT techniques. Method(s): We retrospectively analyzed the data from 840 cases of NPC that received RT from January 1996 to December 2001 in our hospital. The Kaplan-Meier method was used to calculate the control rate of nasopharynx, the tumor-free survival rate and overall survival. Log-rank test was conducted to determine significance. The Cox proportional hazards regression model was used to confirm the significance of prognostic factors. Result(s): 1) The total control rates of nasopharynx for 3, 5 and 10 years were 70.6%, 56.7% and 36.6%, respectively. The tumor-free survival rates for 3, 5, and 10 years were 66.8%, 51.8% and 32.0%, respectively. The overall survival rates for 3, 5, and 10 years were 73.8%, 58.6% and 39.4%, respectively. 2) Univariate logistic regression analysis showed that gender, age, clinical stage, T stage, N stage, skull base invasion, cranial nerve invasion, nasal cavity invasion, cervical node metastasis, unilateral/bilateral neck node metastasis, cervical node metastasis position, intracavity brachytherapy of nasopharynx, external beam radiotherapy method and chemotherapy were significantly associated with the control rate of nasopharynx, tumor-free survival, and overall survival (P<0.05). The irradiation dose of nasopharynx was significantly associated with the nasopharynx control rate and overall survival (P<0.05). The tumor-free survival of the patients with carotid sheath involvement was lower than that of the patients without carotid sheath involvement (P<0.05). 3) Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that gender, age, clinical stage, T stage, unilateral/bilateral cervical node metastasis, and intracavity brachytherapy of nasopharynx were independent influential factors of the control rate of nasopharynx, tumor-free survival and overall survival. 4) The stratified analysis showed that T2 and T3 patients who received adjuvant high dose intracavity brachytherapy of nasopharynx presented with a higher control rate of nasopharynx, tumor-free survival and overall survival (P<0.05). Conclusion(s): Male NPC patients with advanced clinical stage (especially T stage) and bilateral cervical node metastasis have a poorer prognosis. Adjuvant intracavity brachytherapy of nasopharynx can improve the prognosis of T2 and T3 patients.",Excluded
1914,"Radiation-induced comet-formation in human skin fibroblasts from radiotherapy patients with different normal tissue reactions Background: In clinical radiotherapy most patients tolerate the applied dosage with no or moderate side effects. However, 5 to 10% of all individuals show increased acute and/or late reactions. In-vitro test systems are investigated for their suitability for predictive purposes. This paper attempts a correlation between the induction and repair of DNA damage measured in the comet assay and the clinical observed reaction in order to evaluate the suitability of the comet assay for prediction of radiation sensitivity. Patients and Methods: Skin fibroblasts of 30 patients with average tissue reactions or acute and/or late increased side effects and cell lines of 4 individuals carrying the heritable disease ataxia telangiectasia (AT) were irradiated in vitro. The induction and repair of DNA damage was measured at different time points after irradiation in the comet assay (single cell gel electrophoresis). These results were compared to the acute and late clinical reactions classified according to the RTOG grading system. Result(s): The radiation induced DNA damage decreased over time reflecting DNA repair. Cells of the AT individuals showed an elevated damage induction and a reduced repair capacity compared to patients with average tissue reactions. Fibroblasts of patients with increased acute and late side effects exhibited slower DNA repair. In addition to the known lack of cell cycle control, our results indicate that AT cells show reduced DNA repair capacity. Conclusion(s): The comet assay seems to be able to detect some types of increased individual radiation sensitivity. In contrast to other predictive in-vitro tests, the comet assay needs less time and fewer cells, which would be useful in a clinical setting.",Included
1383,"Multiple sclerosis, brain radiotherapy, and risk of neurotoxicity: The Mayo Clinic experience Purpose: The aim of this study was a retrospective assessment of neurotoxicity in patients with multiple sclerosis (MS) receiving external beam radiotherapy (EBRT) to the brain. Methods and Materials: We studied 15 consecutively treated patients with MS who received brain EBRT. Neurologic toxicity was assessed with the Common Toxicity Criteria v.3.0. Result(s): Median follow-up for the 5 living patients was 6.0 years (range, 3.3-27.4 years). No exacerbation of MS occurred in any patient during EBRT. Five patients had Grade 4 neurologic toxicity and 1 had possible Grade 5 toxicity. Kaplan-Meier estimated risk of neurotoxicity greater than Grade 4 at 5 years was 57% (95% confidence interval, 27%-82%). Toxicity occurred at 37.5 to 54.0 Gy at a median of 1.0 year (range, 0.2-4.3 years) after EBRT. Univariate analysis showed an association between opposed-field irradiation of the temporal lobes, central white matter, and brainstem and increased risk of neurotoxicity (p < 0.04). Three of 6 cases of toxicity occurred in patients treated before 1986. Conclusion(s): External beam radiotherapy of the brain in patients with MS may be associated with an increased risk of neurotoxicity compared with patients without demyelinating illnesses. However, this risk is associated with treatment techniques that may not be comparable to modern, conformal radiotherapy. © 2006 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.",Excluded
3585,"Salvage stereotactic radiosurgery with adjuvant use of bevacizumab for heavily treated recurrent brain metastases: a preliminary report It is not uncommon for brain metastasis (BM) treated with stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) to demonstrate radiographic enlargement, with the patient developing neurological deficits attributable to a lesion at the site of SRS. The management of both local recurrence and radiation-induced necrosis (RN) poses a significant therapeutic dilemma, if surgical resection is not feasible, and effective therapies have yet to be established. This preliminary study introduces our initial experience with salvage SRS using adjuvant bevacizumab for this refractory entity. We retrospectively reviewed five patients who had received salvage SRS using adjuvant bevacizumab for recurrent BM complicated by RN. The diagnosis was based on clinical features, serial imaging studies and/or histopathological findings. Patients underwent salvage SRS followed by the first cycle of bevacizumab (7.5-10 mg/kg intravenous). Bevacizumab was repeated every 3-4 weeks until tumor progression or significant toxic events. The number of bevacizumab doses ranged from 2 to 16 (median 4). Follow-up MR imaging demonstrated a clear radiographic response in all lesions. Neurological symptoms improved in three patients and stabilized in two. In two patients, bevacizumab treatment was discontinued due to anemia and gastrointestinal bleeding, respectively. At the time of data analysis, four patients had died and the other was still alive. The causes of death were neurological decline and systemic disease progression in two patients each. Salvage SRS with adjuvant bevacizumab use appeared to provide an adequate radiographic response as well as neurological palliation for selected patients with heavily treated recurrent BM complicated by RN.Copyright © 2015, Springer Science+Business Media New York.",Excluded
2820,"Human brain imaging and radiation dosimetry of 11C-N-desmethyl-loperamide, a PET radiotracer to measure the function of P-glycoprotein UNLABELLED: P-glycoprotein (P-gp) is a membrane-bound efflux pump that limits the distribution of drugs to several organs of the body. At the blood-brain barrier, P-gp blocks the entry of both loperamide and its metabolite, N-desmethyl-loperamide (N-dLop), and thereby prevents central opiate effects. Animal studies have shown that (11)C-dLop, compared with (11)C-loperamide, is an especially promising radiotracer because it generates negligible radiometabolites that enter the brain. The purposes of this study were to determine whether (11)C-dLop is a substrate for P-gp at the blood-brain barrier in humans and to measure the distribution of radioactivity in the entire body to estimate radiation exposure., METHODS: Brain PET scans were acquired in 4 healthy subjects for 90 min and included concurrent measurements of the plasma concentration of unchanged radiotracer. Time-activity data from the whole brain were quantified using a 1-tissue-compartment model to estimate the rate of entry (K(1)) of radiotracer into the brain. Whole-body PET scans were acquired in 8 healthy subjects for 120 min., RESULTS: For brain imaging, after the injection of (11)C-dLop the concentration of radioactivity in the brain was low (standardized uptake value, approximately 15%) and stable after approximately 20 min. In contrast, uptake of radioactivity in the pituitary was about 50-fold higher than that in the brain. The plasma concentration of (11)C-dLop declined rapidly, but the percentage composition of plasma was unusually stable, with the parent radiotracer constituting 85% of total radioactivity after approximately 5 min. The rate of brain entry was low (K(1) = 0.009 +/- 0.002 mL.cm(-3). min(-1); n = 4). For whole-body imaging, as a measure of radiation exposure to the entire body the effective dose of (11)C-dLop was 7.8 +/- 0.6 muSv/MBq (n = 8)., CONCLUSION: The low brain uptake of radioactivity is consistent with (11)C-dLop being a substrate for P-gp in humans and confirms that this radiotracer generates negligible quantities of brain-penetrant radiometabolites. In addition, the low rate of K(1) is consistent with P-gp rapidly effluxing substrates while they transit through the lipid bilayer. The radiation exposure of (11)C-dLop is similar to that of many other (11)C-radiotracers. Thus, (11)C-dLop is a promising radiotracer to study the function of P-gp at the blood-brain barrier, at which impaired function would allow increased uptake into the brain.",Excluded

2394,"Dose-volume relationship for laryngeal substructures and aspiration in patients with locally advanced head-and-neck cancer Background: Literature has shown a significant relationship between radiation dose to the larynx and swallowing disorders. We prospectively studied the dose-volume relationship for larynx substructures and aspiration. Method(s): Forty nine patients with stage III/IV head-and-neck (H&N) squamous cell carcinoma were prospectively enrolled in this IRB-approved, federally funded study. All patients received IMRT-based chemoradiation therapy (CRT) and were scheduled for videofluorography (VFG) prior to CRT and at 3, 6, 9, 12, and 24 months post-CRT. Twelve laryngeal substructures were contoured in each patient: thyroid cartilage, cricoid cartilage, total epiglottis, suprahyoid epiglottis, infrahyoid epiglottis, total larynx, supraglottic larynx, subglottic larynx, glottic larynx, arytenoids, aryepiglottic (AE) folds, and glossoepiglottic fold. After exclusions, 29 patients were included in the final analysis. Incidence of aspiration at 1 year following CRT was correlated with dose-volume data to laryngeal substructures using logistic regression. Result(s): The median age was 54 years with 79% being non-smokers. Tumor sites included oropharynx (22), unknown primary (6), and hypopharynx (1). One year following CRT, 10/29 (34%) showed aspiration on VFG. Dose to the AE folds showed the highest correlation with aspiration at 12 months and was significant on multivariate analysis (p = 0.025). A mean dose cutpoint of 6500 cGy or higher to the AE folds was associated with an increased risk of aspiration at 1 year [positive likelihood ratio (+LR) 2.81, positive predictive value (PPV) 60%, negative predictive value (NPV) 92.9%, relative risk (RR) 8.4]. Conclusion(s): In this analysis, mean dose to the AE folds was associated with an increased risk of aspiration at 1 year.

1848,"Carcinogenesis studies with benzoyl peroxide (Panoxyl gel 5%) Several groups of hairless mice were given UV radiation with and without pretreatment with 7,12-dimethylbenz(a)anthracene (DMBA), 5% benzoyl peroxide in a gel (Panoxyl), and gel alone, in various combinations, with appropriate control groups included, in order to see whether benzoyl peroxide, which is known to enhance chemical skin carcinogenesis after a single, small dose of DMBA, also enhances UV carcinogenesis. The mice were observed for skin tumors, and all skin lesions were histologically investigated. The percentage of tumor-bearing animals with time is called the tumor rate, the total number of tumors occurring is called the tumor yield. Continual treatment with 5% benzoyl peroxide in gel twice a week, with or without a short pretreatment period of UV radiation resulted in only 2 skin carcinomas, which is remarkable, but not significant. Both Panoxyl and gel alone enhanced tumorigenicity significantly in animals pretreated with a single dose of 51.2 micrograms DMBA. There was no difference between the enhancement caused by Panoxyl and the gel as regards the tumor rate, but when measured as final tumor yield, Panoxyl was slightly more tumor-enhancing than gel alone. However, both Panoxyl and gel protected significantly against UV tumorigenesis (all tumors). There was no difference between the protective effect of the 2 types of treatment. Neither Panoxyl nor gel alone influenced significantly UV skin carcinogenesis (malignant tumors). It is concluded that under these experimental conditions both Panoxyl and gel alone tend to protect against the tumorigenicity and do not enhance the carcinogenicity of UV radiation in hairless mice, whereas both gel and Panoxyl enhance chemical carcinogenesis. The carcinogenic mechanisms may be different for UV and chemical carcinogenesis, respectively.",Excluded

2406,"Iterative image reconstruction techniques: Applications for cardiac CT Traditional limitations of cardiac CT are related to image noise, blooming artifacts from calcifications and stents, and radiation exposure. We evaluated whether these limitations can be ameliorated by the use of iterative reconstruction in image space (IRIS) instead of traditional filtered back projection (FBP) image reconstruction techniques. We compared image reconstruction with the use of IRIS with traditional FBP for their effect on image quality, noise, volume of heavy coronary artery calcifications, and stents as a measure of ""blooming"" artifacts, and radiation dose at cardiac CT. The radiation dose comparison was performed as a matched pair analysis, whereas all other comparisons were performed within the same group of patients. The subjective image quality of IRIS reconstructions was rated higher than FBP reconstructions. Image noise was lower with IRIS than with FBP. The volume of stents and heavy coronary artery calcifications measured lower in IRIS reconstructed series compared with FBP. Similar levels of image noise were achieved with 80/100 kVp of tube voltage with IRIS compared with 120 kVp and FBP, resulting in a 62% reduction in effective dose. Our preliminary experiences suggest that IRIS incrementally improves the CT evaluation of coronary arteries, especially in challenging scenarios. Substantial radiation reduction seems feasible without associated increases in image noise. Copyright © 2011 Society of Cardiovascular Computed Tomography. Published by Elsevier Inc.

2301,"Feasibility and efficiency of double-agent versus single-agent concurrent chemoradiotherapy in patients with nasopharyngeal carcinoma Purpose: Concurrent chemoradiotherapy (CCRT) is the mainstay of treatment for nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) patients. It remains unclear whether double-agent CCRT (d-CCRT) is more effective than single-agent CCRT (s-CCRT). In this study, we compared the treatment efficiency and toxicity of d-CCRT with s-CCRT in NPC patients. Methods and materials: Patients with stage II-IV NPC treated with d-CCRT or s-CCRT were retrospectively reviewed. The d-CCRT group patients were compared with s-CCRT group patients for overall survival (OS), locoregional relapse-free survival (LRRFS), disease-free survival (DFS), distant metastasis-free survival (DMFS) and toxicity. Differences in baseline characteristics were adjusted using the pair-matching method. Result(s): In this study, 933 patients who received CCRT for NPC between 2011 and 2014 were pair-matched at a 1:2 ratio (n = 311 for d-CCRT; n = 622 for s-CCRT). The d-CCRT treated patients showed no significant advantages in terms of 4-year OS (87.2% vs. 85.5%), DFS (84.1% vs. 79.5%), LRRFS (94.6% vs. 91.8%), DMFS (87.5% vs. 85.5%) compared with s-CCRT treated patients (P = 0.450, 0.106, 0.203, 0.366, respectively). Multivariate analysis showed that CCRT regimen had no significant effects on survival. In the d-CCRT group, the incidence of grade 3-4 hematological toxicities was significantly higher. Conclusion(s): The d-CCRT regimen did not confer significant survival benefits compared with the s-CCRT regimen in the treatment of stage II-IV NPC patients. Furthermore, patients treated with the d-CCRT regimen experienced greater hematological toxicity.Copyright © 2020 Elsevier Ltd",Excluded
1557,"Mortality and cancer incidence following occupational radiation exposure: third analysis of the National Registry for Radiation Workers Mortality and cancer incidence were studied in the National Registry for Radiation Workers in, relative to earlier analyses, an enlarged cohort of 174 541 persons, with longer follow-up (to 2001) and, for the first time, cancer registration data. SMRs for all causes and all malignant neoplasms were 81 and 84 respectively, demonstrating a 'healthy worker effect'. Within the cohort, mortality and incidence from both leukaemia excluding CLL and the grouping of all malignant neoplasms excluding leukaemia increased to a statistically significant extent with increasing radiation dose. Estimates of the trend in risk with dose were similar to those for the Japanese A-bomb survivors, with 90% confidence intervals that excluded both risks more than 2-3 times greater than the A-bomb values and no raised risk. Some evidence of an increasing trend with dose in mortality from all circulatory diseases may, at least partly, be due to confounding by smoking. This analysis provides the most precise estimates to date of mortality and cancer risks following occupational radiation exposure and strengthens the evidence for raised risks from these exposures. The cancer risk estimates are consistent with values used to set radiation protection standards.",Included

3493,"Identification of ERp29 as a biomarker for predicting nasopharyngeal carcinoma response to radiotherapy Radioresistance continues to be a major problem in the treatment of nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC). This study aimed to identify novel proteins associated with NPC radio-resistance. We used a mass spectrometry driven-proteomic strategy to identify novel proteins associated with NPC radio-resistance, and differential proteins were subsequently processed by bio-informatic analysis. As a result, twelve proteins were identified with aberrant expression in radioresistant (RR) NPC tissues compare to radiosensitive (RS) NPC tissues. Among these proteins, ERp29, Mn-SOD, HSP27 and GST omega1 were found to be significantly up-regulated in RR NPC tissues, and ERp29 was selected for further validation. Immunohistochemistry analysis confirmed that ERp29 was overexpressed in RR NPC tissues compared with RS NPC tissues. To prove the role of ERp29 in the induction of NPC radioresistance, ERp29 was down-regulated in the ERp29 enriched NPC cells CNE-1 and 6-10B by specific shRNA. Radiosensitivity was measured using cell proliferation assay and clonogenic survival assay, and cell apoptosis was measured using flow cytometric analysis. We found that ERp29 knockdown attenuated CNE-1 and 6-10B cell radioresistance and enhanced cell apoptosis. These results suggest that ERp29 associates with radioresistance in NPC, and ERp29 could be a potential biomarker for predicting NPC response to radiotherapy.",Included
2751,"Intrinsic Functional Boundaries of Lateral Frontal Cortex in the Common Marmoset Monkey The common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus) is a small New World primate species that has been recently targeted as a potentially powerful preclinical model of human prefrontal cortex dysfunction. Although the structural boundaries of frontal cortex were described in marmosets at the start of the 20th century (Brodmann, 1909) and refined more recently (Paxinos et al., 2012), the broad functional boundaries of marmoset frontal cortex have yet to be established. In this study, we sought to functionally derive boundaries of the marmoset lateral frontal cortex (LFC) using ultra-high field (9.4 T) resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (RS-fMRI). We collected RS-fMRI data in seven (four females, three males) lightly anesthetized marmosets and used a data-driven hierarchical clustering approach to derive subdivisions of the LFC based on intrinsic functional connectivity. We then conducted seed-based analyses to assess the functional connectivity between these clusters and the rest of the brain. The results demonstrated seven distinct functional clusters within the LFC. The functional connectivity patterns of these clusters with the rest of the brain were also found to be distinct and organized along a rostrocaudal gradient, consonant with those found in humans and macaques. Overall, these results support the view that marmosets are a promising preclinical modeling species for studying LFC dysfunction related to neuropsychiatric or neurodegenerative human brain diseases. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT The common marmoset is a New World primate that has garnered recent attention as a powerful complement to canonical Old World primate (e.g., macaques) and rodent models (e.g., rats, mice) for preclinical modeling of the human brain in healthy and diseased states. A critical step in the development of marmosets for such models is to characterize functional network topologies of frontal cortex in healthy, normally functioning marmosets, that is, how these circuitries are functionally divided and how those topologies compare to human circuitry. To our knowledge, this is the first study to demonstrate functional boundaries of the lateral frontal cortex and the corresponding network topologies in marmoset monkeys.

1998,"Reliability of appendicular muscle mass assessment by bioelectrical impedance analysis vs. dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry in hemodialysis patients Background: Loss of skeletal muscle mass(MM) increases the risk for morbidity and mortality in hemodialysis (HD) patients. Dual energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) is a valid tool for assessing skeletal MM but limited by cost and radiation exposure. In contrast, bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA) is cheap and has no radiation exposure risk. Aim of this study was to assess the concordance between MM measured by BIA and DXA in HD patients. Method(s): We enrolled 55 clinically stable HD patients. Body composition, including appendicular lean muscle mass (ALM), was evaluated by BIA (Inbody S10) and whole body DXA (HOLOGIC). Hand grip strength (HGS) was performed to evaluate muscle performance. Agreement between tools was assessed by means of the Bland Altman method. Multiple linear regression was used to develop an ALM value by BIA closed to that by DXA. Result(s): The mean age was 63.4+/-11.29 years (range 39 to 88 years) and 65.5% were men. The prevalence of diabetes and hypertension was 54.5% and 94.5%, respectively. There was a significant association between muscle mass index which determined via DXA and BIA. The mean value of ALM divided by the height2 (AMMI) was found to be 5.98+/-0.90 kg/m2 and 7.90 +/-1.39 kg/m2 by DXA and by BIA, respectively, indicating overestimation of ALM in BIA method. BIA overestimated total body lean mass in 98% of participants. Bland-Altman plots for differences in AMMI between BIA and DXA showed large bias (Mean= 1.92kg/m2), with significant mean differences ([0.29, 3.55], P<0.001). After adjusting for sex, age and BMI, AMMI by BIA was significantly correlated with those measure by DXA (R2=0.643, P<0.001). Using the formula, we can estimate the AMMI by DXA with AMMI by BIA (DXA=0.859+0.452BIA+0.068BMI, R2=0.709, P<0.001). Mean HGS was 24.6+/-7.90 kg and AMMI showed no correlation with the HGS. Conclusion(s): Our results showed that AMMI measured by BIA is reliable but overestimated in HD patients. Further reinfinement of adaptation formula for use BIA is needed to obtain accurate measurement of AMMI close to that measured by DXA.",Excluded

1437,"Cancers after renal transplantation in Tunisia: Multicenter experience Introduction: Renal transplant recipients are at higher risk of certain tumors such as lymphomas and skin cancers than the general and dialysis populations. Method(s): We retrospectively studied the prevalence of tumors in adult renal transplant recipients in five Tunisian centers of transplantation in Tunis, Monastir, sousse and Sfax from January 1986 to January 2008. Result(s): The study included 52 patients; 32 men and 20 women with a mean age of 36 years (range from 18-54 years). The mean time since dialysis to transplantation was 46 months (20-236 months). Induction therapy was based on thymoglobulin in 100 % and administered in a mean course of 12.4 days in 82,2 % of the patients. Maintenance therapy was based on calcineurin inhibitors (CNI) in 91,2 % of cases, on antimetabolites and corticosteroids in 100 % of cases. Acute rejection occurred in 36 of these cases and was treated with polyclonal or monoclonal antibodies on 40 % of cases. Incidence of cancer among our population was 6,6 % and occurred after a mean period of 55,4 months of transplantation for solid tumors and 99 months for skin tumors. Eighty three percent of the tumors were solid, and the rest were in the skin. Kaposi sarcoma formed 58.6 % and non-Hodgkin or Hodgkin lymphoma 21.7 % of the solid tumors, while spinocellular carcinoma formed 83% and basocellular carcinoma 17% of the skin tumors. Switching CNI to sirolimus in 8.3% cases was associated with a favorable outcome. Mortality was the outcome in 28.3% of the patients with cancer, while partial or complete regression of cancers was observed in 54.7% cases after decreasing the doses of the immunosuppressive medications. Conclusion(s): We conclude that post renal transplant cancer is mainly characterized by the predominance of Kaposi sarcoma favored by solar exposure and excessive Induction and maintenance immunosuppression. Careful follow-up may results in early intervention and decrease mortality.",Excluded
813,"Seventy-Peak Kilovoltage High-Pitch Thoracic Aortic CT Angiography without ECG Gating: Evaluation of Image Quality and Radiation Dose RATIONALE AND OBJECTIVES: To assess the feasibility of 70-kVp high-pitch non-ECG-gated thoracic aortic computed tomography angiography (CTA) with 40-mL contrast agent compared to 100-kVp standard-pitch CTA with 60-mL contrast agent., MATERIALS AND METHODS: Sixty-seven patients (51 men and 16 women; mean age, 55 +/- 14 years) received non-ECG-gated aortic CTA at 70 kVp, high pitch of 3.4, and 40-mL contrast agent (group A, n = 31) or CTA at 100-kVp, pitch of 1.2, and 60-mL contrast agent (group B, n = 36). Iterative reconstruction was used in all patients. For image quality assessment, CTA images were evaluated on a three-point scale and signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR) were calculated and compared. Furthermore, computed tomography (CT) dose index was recorded., RESULTS: Mean CT values and noise levels were higher in group A compared to group B (all P < .001), whereas SNR and CNR were lower than those in group B (all P < .001). Furthermore, the image quality of the aorta at the level of the diaphragm was lower in group A than that in group B (P < .05). However, image quality was graded as diagnostic in all patients, and motion artifacts of the aortic arch were significantly decreased in group A (P <.05). Interreader agreement was good or excellent for image quality assessment (k = 0.625-0.835). The 70-kVp CTA protocol, which allows dose reduction of 85%, was considered diagnostic in all instances by two readers., CONCLUSIONS: Our proposed thoracic aortic CTA protocol provides diagnostic information with substantial reduction of both radiation and contrast agent doses compared to standard-pitch CTA at 100 kVp.

3054,"The impact of PET/CT on radiotherapy of anal cancer Purpose: To compare Transanal endoscopic Ultrasound (TAUS) and abdominal Ultrasound (US) with PET/CT in detecting regional lymph noDe metastases in patients with anal cancer. The impact of the PET/CT on the treatment plan was evaluated. Materials: Ninety-five (95) patients referred to our clinic between July 1st 2005 and December 31 2009 were retrospectively reviewed. All patients had biopsy-proven primary squamous cell cancer of the anal canal. There were 65 females (68%) and 30 males (32%), and the median age was 58 (age range 35-88 years). All patients were staged during anaesthesia with 3- Dimensional Transanal Endoscopic Ultrasound (TAUS) and US of the inguinal regions. Seventy-seven (77) patients were furthermore examined with US of the abdomen. All 95 patients underwent whole-body FDG-PET/CT as part of radiotherapy planning. The detection of suspicious perirectal, internal iliac and inguinal lymph nodes by TAUS/US and PET/CT, respectively, was evaluated. Suspicious perirectal and internal iliac lymph noDe were not biopsied. Suspicious inguinal lymph nodes were biopsied with few exceptions. Result(s): Twenty-eight patients were diagnosed with suspicious perirectal noDe metastases. TAUS identified 24 of the patients. PET/CT identified 15, nine of which had not been seen on TAUS. Eleven patients were diagnosed with suspicious internal iliac noDe metastases, all of which were detected on PET/CT. One of these patients had not been examined with abdominal US. US diagnosed suspicious internal iliac nodes in one patient.Inguinal nodes suspicious of malignancy were visualized on either US or PET/CT in 41 patients. Seventeen (17) of these had confirmed malignant disease on biopsy, and 15 had confirmed benign disease. All 17 patients (100%) with malignant inguinal nodes were diagnosed by PET/CT, whereas US identified 16 of the 17 patients (94%). PET/CT detected suspicious inguinal nodes in 10 patients, which had not been seen on US. On biopsies one of these was proven malignant, three were benign and six did not have any biopsy. Five patients had their treatment changed from radiotherapy alone to concomitant chemoradiotherapy due to the finding of lymph noDe metastases on the PET/CT. Two of these patients had suspicious perirectal nodes, one patient had internal iliac nodes, and the final two patients had inguinal lymph noDe metastasis, of which one was proven malignant on biopsy, and in the other case no biopsy was performed.Six patients were radiated on either one or both inguinal regions as a consequence of additional inguinal noDe metastases detected on the PET/CT. (Table presented) Conclusion(s): Compared to TAUS/US,PET/CT seems important for especially the N2/3-stage in anal cancer and resulted in additional inguinal irradiation of either one or both sides in six patients. The detection of additional lymph noDe metastases on PET/CT resulted in five patients receiving concomitant chemoradiotherapy instead of radiotherapy alone. It is a limitation of this study that not all suspicious lymph nodes were biopsied. However, the true sensitivity and specificity of any staging technique cannot be determined unless the patients undergo a full lymph noDe exairesis. Finally, a minor part of the patients had not been examined with US of the abdomen which makes it impossible to compare PET/CT and US regarding the detection of internal iliac metastases in these cases.",Excluded
633,"Case-control study of lung cancer risk from residential radon exposure in Worcester county, Massachusetts A study of lung cancer risk from residential radon exposure and its radioactive progeny was performed with 200 cases (58% male, 42% female) and 397 controls matched on age and sex, all from the same health maintenance organization. Emphasis was placed on accurate and extensive year-long dosimetry with etch-track detectors in conjunction with careful questioning about historic patterns of in-home mobility. Conditional logistic regression was used to model the outcome of cancer on radon exposure, while controlling for years of residency, smoking, education, income, and years of job exposure to known or potential carcinogens. Smoking was accounted for by nine categories: never smokers, four categories of current smokers, and four categories of former smokers. Radon exposure was divided into six categories (model 1) with break points at 25, 50, 75, 150, and 250 Bq m, the lowest being the reference. Surprisingly, the adjusted odds ratios (AORs) were, in order, 1.00, 0.53, 0.31, 0.47, 0.22, and 2.50 with the third category significantly below 1.0 (p < 0.05), and the second, fourth, and fifth categories approaching statistical significance (p < 0.1). An alternate analysis (model 2) using natural cubic splines allowed calculating AORs as a continuous function of radon exposure. That analysis produces AORs that are substantially less than 1.0 with borderline statistical significance (0.048 < or = p < or = 0.05) between approximately 85 and 123 Bq m. College-educated subjects in comparison to high-school dropouts have a significant reduction in cancer risk after controlling for smoking, years of residency, and job exposures with AOR = 0.30 (95% CI: 0.13, 0.69), p = 0.005 (model 1).",Included
3156,"Postsurgical treatment of early-stage breast cancer with electronic brachytherapy: Outcomes and health-related quality of life at 1 year OBJECTIVES:: This multicenter registry followed up patients with early-stage breast cancer treated with breast-conserving surgery and electronic brachytherapy (EBT). This report provides 1- and 2-year updates to the initial publication. METHOD(S):: Patients were of age 50 years or more with invasive carcinoma or ductal carcinoma in situ, tumor size <=3 cm, and negative surgical margins. After lumpectomy, patients received EBT in 10 fractions over 5 days (34 Gy total). RESULT(S):: Of the 69 patients enrolled, 62 were evaluated at 1 year and 20 patients at 2 years after treatment. At 1 year, 28 (45.2%) patients reported adverse events that were possibly, probably, or definitely related to treatment. Most (90%) were grade 1: manageable and typical of radiation therapy. Four events were grade 2: induration/firmness (2), field contracture (1), and seroma (1). One event was grade 3: a draining fistula at the lumpectomy site due to residual effects of a breast infection at 1 month. No recurrences have been reported. Cosmetic ratings were excellent or good in 93.4% of patients at 1 year. Most patients (69%) were energetic most or all of the time. Most patients (69% to 98%) were not affected by individual symptoms of breast disease at 1 year. Generally patients who had an adverse event did not report the corresponding symptom on the quality-of-life questionnaire.

3369,"Tissue flap transferring for wound repair of the clavicle OBJECTIVE: To investigate the result of tissue flap transferring for wound repair of the clavicle. METHOD(S): From 1994 to 2000, 3 patients (1 with clavicle osteosynthesis, 1 with chronic clavicle osteomyelitis, and 1 with radioactive ulcer in clavicular region accompanied by chronic osteomyelitis of clavicle) were reconstructed with turnover adipofascial flap, myocutaneous flap of pectoris, and myocutaneous flap of latissimus dorsal respectively. The outcome was observed. The operation principles of tissue flaps transferring for wound repair of the clavicle were summarized. RESULT(S): Follow-ups were done for 2 months to 7 years. All tissue flaps survived well and the wounds in clavicular region were healed well. There was no recurrence of chronic clavicle osteomyelitis. CONCLUSION(S): Turnover adipofascial flap, myocutaneous flap of pectoris and latissimus dorsal are often used for wound repair of the clavicle. Most of the wounds of the clavicle can be repaired by turnover adipofascial flap. Myocutaneous flap of pectoris and latissimus dorsal are more suitable for wound repair with chronic clavicle osteomyelitis.

2475,"Magnetic navigation in left-sided AV reentrant tachycardias: Preliminary results of a retrograde approach Introduction: A novel magnetic navigation system allows remote guidance of floppy radiofrequency (RF) ablation catheters. We evaluated the feasibility of mapping and ablation of left-sided accessory pathways (APs) using the retrograde transaortic approach with this system. This might open the gate to retrograde ablation of left atrial arrhythmias. Methods and Results: Twenty consecutive patients were included. A Helios II was used in five and in 15 a Celsius RMT RF catheter with higher magnetic mass and different flexibility was used. Mapping and ablation were attempted. The learning curve was analyzed. Ablation was acutely successful in 60% of the patients using the Helios II and in 80% using the Celsius RMT. Median procedure time was 158 minutes, with median patient and physician fluoroscopy times of 26 and 4 minutes. In the last 10 patients, procedure times became significantly shorter (median 122 minutes, only Celsius RMT catheters) and standard catheters had to be used only twice. No complications occurred. Conclusion(s): Remote retrograde transaortic RF ablation of left-sided APs is feasible, safe, and reduces the physician's fluoroscopy exposure. There is a very steep initial learning curve, with the success rate increasing from 50% in the first 10 cases to 80% in the last 10 cases.

3324,"A single-institution phase I feasibility study of dose-escalated IMRT for non-operative locally advanced esophageal carcinoma Background and purpose: Radiation dose escalation to improve poor outcomes with chemoradiation in locally advanced esophageal carcinoma is limited in part by increased toxicity. This Phase I study investigates the use of IMRT to improve tolerability of dose escalation. Material(s) and Method(s): A single-institution, prospective study was conducted between 2007 and 2013 for individuals with inoperable esophageal carcinoma. Gross disease received 60 Gy in 30 fractions and at-risk sites received 54 Gy with simultaneous integrated boost. Concurrent chemotherapy primarily consisted of cisplatin/5-FU. The primary objective was to assess feasibility (<15% rate of grade 4-5 toxicity). Secondary objectives included assessment of overall survival (OS), progression free survival (PFS), and locoregional (LRR) and distant recurrence. Result(s): Twenty-six patients were enrolled with median follow up of 17.6 months (range 0.1 to 152.0). The majority were AJCC 7th edition Stage III (54%), distal esophagus primary (81%), and adenocarcinoma histology (85%). Twenty-one patients (81%) completed their course of radiation therapy, while only 55% received 2 cycles of concurrent cisplatin/5-FU. One grade 5 and one grade 4 cardiac event occurred, both during chemoradiation and before receiving 50 Gy. The 3-year OS was 48.6% (95% CI: 32.5 to 72.2%) and PFS was 28.5% (95% CI: 14.6 to 55.5%). Half developed distant failure with LRR occurring in 10 patients (38%), isolated in 5 patients. Conclusion(s): While feasibility was demonstrated, toxicity and compliance remained limiting factors with outcomes similar to historical controls.

3183,"Chromosomal principle of radiation-induced F1 sterility in Ephestia kuehniella (Lepidoptera: Pyralidae) A dose-response analysis of chromosomal aberrations was performed in male progeny of gamma-irradiated males in the flour moth, Ephestia kuehniella. For comparison, several female progeny from each dose level were examined. Aberrations were detected on microspread preparations of pachytene nuclei in the electron microscope and classified according to pairing configurations of synaptonemal complexes (SCs). Fragmentation and various translocations were the most numerous aberrations, whereas interstitial deletion and inversion were rare. At 100 Gy, relatively simple multiple translocations were found. Multiple translocations showing complicated configurations occurred at 150 and 200 Gy, and their number increased with the dose. In males, the mean number of chromosomal breaks resulting in aberrations linearly increased with the dose from 8.4 to 16.2 per nucleus. In females, this value achieved a maximum of 11.2 breaks/nucleus at 200 Gy. Three factors were suggested to contribute to the reported higher level of F1 sterility in males than females: (i) survival of males with high numbers of breaks, (ii) crossing-over in spermatogenesis but not in the achiasmatic oogenesis, and (iii) a higher impact of induced changes on the fertility of males than females. It was concluded that translocations are most responsible for the production of unbalanced gametes resulting in sterility of F1 moths. However, F1 sterility predicted according to the observed frequency of aberrations was much higher than the actual sterility reported earlier. This suggests a regulation factor which corrects the predicted unbalanced state towards balanced segregation of translocated chromosomes.",Excluded

In group A, 317 patients who underwent CT with only ATCM and a fixed body mass index-adjusted tube voltage (120 kV or 100 kV) were enrolled. In group B, both ATCM and ATVS were used. Image attenuation and noise were measured in different anatomic regions., RESULTS: The mean contrast-to-noise ratio and the signal-to-noise ratio of abdomen and chest CT was higher in group B compared with group A (p < 0.0001). In total, the effective radiation doses for abdomen and chest CT examinations were significantly reduced in group B by 18% compared with group A (p < 0.0001). When only examining those who benefited from the ATVS tool, a dose reduction of 35% for chest CT and 42% for abdomen CT could be achieved (p < 0.0001 for each)., CONCLUSION: The simultaneous use of ATVS and ATCM enables significant radiation dose reduction in abdominal and thoracic contrast-enhanced CT examinations compared with the use of ATCM alone.",Excluded
867,"18F-fluorocholine versus 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose for PET/CT imaging in patients with suspected relapsing or progressive multiple myeloma: a pilot study Purpose: Hybrid positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) has now become available, as well as whole-body, low-dose multidetector row computed tomography (MDCT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). The radioactive glucose analogue 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) is the most widely used tracer but has a relatively low sensitivity in detecting multiple myeloma (MM). We compared FDG with a more recent metabolic tracer, 18F-fluorocholine (FCH), for the detection of MM lesions at time of disease relapse or progression. Method(s): We analyzed the results of FDG and FCH imaging in 21 MM patients undergoing PET/CT for suspected relapsing or progressive MM. For each patient and each tracer, an on-site reader and a masked reader independently determined the number of intraosseous and extraosseous foci of tracer and the intensity of uptake as measured by their SUVmax and the corresponding target/non-target ratio (T/NT). Result(s): In the skeleton of 21 patients, no foci were found for two cases, uncountable foci were observed in four patients, including some mismatched FCH/FDG foci. In the 15 patients with countable bone foci, the on-site reader detected 72 FDG foci vs. 127 FCH foci (+76 %), whereas the masked reader detected 69 FDG foci vs. 121 FCH foci (+75 %), both differences being significant. Interobserver agreement on the total number of bone foci was very high, with a kappa coefficient of 0.81 for FDG and 0.89 for FCH. Measurement of uptake in the matched foci that took up both tracers revealed a significantly higher median SUVmax and T/NT for FCH vs. FDG. Almost all unmatched foci were FCH-positive FDG-negative (57/59 = 97 % on-site and 56/60 = 93 % on masked reading); they were more frequently observed than matched foci in the head and neck region. Conclusion(s): These findings suggest that PET/CT performed for suspected relapsing or progressive MM would reveal more lesions when using FCH rather than FDG.Copyright © 2016, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.",Excluded
3699,"Patient-Centered Outcomes Related to Imaging Testing in US Primary Care Background: Imaging tests are one of the most sophisticated types of diagnostic tools used in health care, yet there are concerns that imaging is overused. Currently, tests are typically evaluated and implemented based on their accuracy, and there is limited knowledge about the range of patient-centered outcomes (PCOs) that imaging tests may lead to. This study explores patients' experiences and subsequent outcomes of imaging tests most notable to patients. Method(s): Adult patients from four primary care clinics who had an x-ray, CT, MRI, or ultrasound in the 12 months before recruitment participated in a single semistructured interview to recount their imaging experience. Interview transcripts were analyzed thematically. Result(s): Four themes related to PCOs were identified from 45 interviews. Participants' mean age was 53 years (25-83 years), 30 had undergone a diagnostic imaging test, and 15 underwent imaging for screening or monitoring. Themes included knowledge gained from the imaging test, its contribution to their overall health care journey, physical experiences during the test procedure, and impacts of the testing process on emotions. Conclusion(s): Patients identified various imaging test outcomes that were important to them. Measurement and reporting these outcomes should be considered more often in diagnostic research. Tools for providers and patients to discuss and utilize these outcomes may help promote shared decision making around the use and impact of imaging tests.Copyright © 2018",Excluded
2934,"Radical radiation treatment of invasive and locally advanced bladder carcinoma in elderly patients A total of 146 patients with invasive or locally advanced carcinoma of the bladder (T2-T4) underwent radiation treatment. A significantly higher complete response rate was observed with doses equal to or above 55 Gy and with doses corresponding to cumulative radiation effect (CRE) values of 1700 radiation effect units (reu) or more. In multivariate analysis, decreasing time from the first diagnosis of bladder carcinoma to radiation treatment and 1 or more transurethral resections was associated with a significant increase in survival; increases in T category and sedimentation rate were negative prognostic factors. Although both radiation dose and CRE levels had a significant effect on survival in univariate analysis, an increase in CRE levels alone was associated with a significant increase in survival in multivariate analysis. However, the most important predictor of survival was whether the patient showed a complete local response or not. This study emphasises the importance of treating patients with an adequate radiation dose over a short period of time in order to achieve the maximum radiobiological effect and thereby increase the possibility of cure.",Excluded
3210,"Radiation exposure associated with dedicated renal mass computed tomography protocol: impact of patient characteristics BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Renal mass protocol CT (RMP-CT) using multiphase abdomen and pelvis CT imaging is the mainstay for diagnosis, characterization, and follow-up for renal masses; however, it is associated with ionizing radiation to the patient. We sought to quantify the effective dose associated with RMP-CT and to determine how patient factors affect radiation exposure., MATERIAL AND METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed the records of 247 patients undergoing management of a small renal mass (cT1a) between 2005 and 2011 at our institution. Body mass index (BMI) was categorized as normal weight, overweight, obese, and morbidly obese (<=25, 25.1-30, 30.1-35 and >35, respectively). Effective dose of RMP-CT was calculated through the dose-length-product multiplied by a factor coefficient (0.015). Effective doses in milliSieverts (mSv) were correlated to patient characteristics., RESULTS: Patients' median age was 61 years, and median BMI was 28.7 kg/m(2); 72% were Caucasian and 56% were male. Median effective dose was 26.1 mSv (interquartile range 20.6-35.3). When stratified by BMI, the median effective doses were 18.9, 25.2, 27.7, and 36.2mSv for normal weight, overweight, obese, and morbidly obese patients, respectively. On multivariable analyses, BMI and male sex were significantly associated with increased radiation dose., CONCLUSIONS: In this series, the median effective dose for RMP-CT was 26.1 mSv. Obesity was independently associated with markedly increased radiation exposure, with morbidly obese patients being exposed to almost twice the amount of radiation compared with normal weight persons. These findings should be considered when devising management strategies in patients with a renal mass and strategies should be developed to reduce medical ionizing radiation exposure.",Excluded

IMRT is the standard RT treatment and has been widely adopted in Western countries to treat HNCs. However, its uptake in clinical practice among NPC patients has never been studied., METHODS: We investigated the use of IMRT for NPC using data from a nationwide cancer registry to describe the use of IMRT among NPC patients in Japan. We analyzed the data of patients with HNC, including NPC, who underwent IMRT between 2012 and 2014, as recorded in the hospital-based cancer registries linked with insurance claims. We calculated the proportion of patients with NPC who underwent IMRT at each hospital. To evaluate the use of IMRT for NPC, the IMRT use for NPC was compared with the proportion of patients with prostate cancer who underwent IMRT., RESULTS: Among 508 patients with NPC who underwent RT at one of 87 hospitals, 348 (69%) underwent IMRT. This proportion gradually increased between 2012 and 2014 (62%, 64% and 77%). Meanwhile, 4790 patients with prostate cancer (90%) underwent IMRT. Although some hospitals where IMRT was performed treated many patients with NPC, the proportion of patients with NPC who were treated with IMRT was low., CONCLUSIONS: IMRT has not been widely adopted in Japan for treating NPC. Barriers for adopting its use should be identified to close the gap between the standard and actual medical practice in Japan. Copyright © The Author(s) 2019. Published by Oxford University Press.

We developed a protocol of vaccine therapy employing ECP technique to collect large quantity of mononuclear cells from metastatic end stage patients and incubate overnight the collected cells after UVA irradiation in presence of autologous tumor lysate (Transimmunization-TI).The aim of the study was to establish the safety and feasibility of TI and to demonstrate the transformation of the collected monocytes into DCs loaded with tumor antigens.ECP procedures were performed with the ""French method"" employing the Spectra Cobe cell separator.Irradiation in presence of 8-MOP was carried out by Vilbert Lourmat-Macogenic device. Finally the collected cells were transferred into a gas permeable bag fit to platelet storage, incubated at room temperature in presence of autologous tumor lysate and reinfused to the patient after 24 hours.Microbial tests were performed at time of collection and reinfusion..All 10 pts (5 males and 5 females) enrolled, after informed consent and approval of ethical committee, suffered of various metastatic tumors except 1 affected with resistant T cell lymphoma.No relevant side effects were registered also in very compromised patients. Microbial tests were always negative. After a mean follow up of 14 months, 5 patients died for disease progression after a mean treatment time of 5 months, 4 pts are alive with a slow disease progression and 1 patient (T cell cutaneous lymphoma) is alive and well..After overnight incubation, a very high cell viability and MNC purity (mean 82 and 92% respectively) were documented together with a high monocytecontent (on average 2.3x10e9).Moreover, we observed the possibility to generate a higher % of DCs from the monocytes of patient treated with T.I. compared with normal donors and previously chemo-treated pts In conclusion TI appears to be a safe and feasible procedure with the potential to be a short-term ""ex-vivo""large scale DCs generation system that may prime an efficient network of immune stimulation in tumor patients.",Excluded
858,"The effect of anatomical modeling on space radiation dose estimates: A comparison of doses for NASA phantoms and the 5th, 50th, and 95th percentile male and female astronauts The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) performs organ dosimetry and risk assessment for astronauts using model-normalized measurements of the radiation fields encountered in space. To determine the radiation fields in an organ or tissue of interest, particle transport calculations are performed using self-shielding distributions generated with the computer program CAMERA to represent the human body. CAMERA mathematically traces linear rays (or path lengths) through the computerized anatomical man (CAM) phantom, a computational stylized model developed in the early 1970s with organ and body profiles modeled using solid shapes and scaled to represent the body morphometry of the 1950 50th percentile (PCTL) Air Force male. With the increasing use of voxel phantoms in medical and health physics, a conversion from a mathematical-based to a voxel-based ray-tracing algorithm is warranted. In this study, the voxel-based ray tracer (VoBRaT) is introduced to ray trace voxel phantoms using a modified version of the algorithm first proposed by Siddon (1985 Med. Phys. 12 252-5). After validation, VoBRAT is used to evaluate variations in body self-shielding distributions for NASA phantoms and six University of Florida (UF) hybrid phantoms, scaled to represent the 5th, 50th, and 95th PCTL male and female astronaut body morphometries, which have changed considerably since the inception of CAM. These body self-shielding distributions are used to generate organ dose equivalents and effective doses for five commonly evaluated space radiation environments. It is found that dosimetric differences among the phantoms are greatest for soft radiation spectra and light vehicular shielding. 2011 Institute of Physics and Engineering in Medicine.",Excluded

477,"Infrastructure of radiotherapy in the Netherlands: Evaluation of prognoses and introduction of a new model for determining the needs Background and purpose: In the Netherlands, the radiotherapy infrastructure is regulated by a Governmental license system. This requires timely and realistic prognostication of the needs for radiotherapy. In the present study, the latest prognoses (1993) and the realized changes in infrastructure are evaluated and a new prognosis for the period until 2010, which has been calculated using a new model, is presented. Material(s) and Method(s): Data on cancer incidence and use of radiotherapy were obtained from various published national reports and from a survey of all radiotherapy departments. Result(s): The cancer incidence over the period 1993-1997 was about 10% higher than predicted. In 1996 and 1997, the percentage of new cancer patients treated with radiotherapy was 45.6 and 48.2%, respectively. The absolute number of newly irradiated patients was about 10% higher than foreseen in the prognosis. The needs for radiotherapy infrastructure not only depend on epidemiological data and changes in indications for radiotherapy, but also on changes in types of treatment with different workloads. A new model, which uses four categories for teletherapy and four categories for brachytherapy is described and a new prognosis for the required number of linear accelerators and staff up to the year 2010 is presented. Conclusion(s): The original prognosis on cancer incidence and radiotherapy patients underestimated the actual figures considerably. The new prognosis, based on a model, which not only accounts for an increase in number of patients, but also for changes in treatment techniques, is expected to more accurately predict and acquire the required radiotherapy capacity. © 2003 Elsevier Science Ireland Ltd.

1734,"Three-dimensional conformal reirradiation for locoregionally recurrent lung cancer previously treated with radiation therapy Background: To evaluate the efficacy and toxicity of reirradiation using three-dimensional conformal radiotherapy (3D-CRT) in symptomatic patients with locoregionally recurrent lung cancer. Method(s): Between 2005 and 2012, 15 patients with locoregionally recurrent lung cancer were retreated with 3D-CRT after previously receiving thoracic radiotherapy. The median interval between the initial irradiation and reirradiation was 12 months (range, five to 41 months). The median initial radiotherapy dose was 63Gy (range, 45-70 Gy), and reirradiation doses ranged from 25.2 to 45.2Gy (median, 36Gy), with daily fractions of 1.8-4Gy (median, 2Gy). Result(s): After reirradiation, 80% of the patients experienced resolved or diminished symptoms for one or more of their symptoms, with an 83% improvement in a total of 24 symptoms. The overall tumor response rate to reirradiation was 46.7%, with progressive disease occurring in only one patient. The median overall survival (OS) time was 11 months (range, one to 27 months), and the one-year OS rate was 47%. The progression-free survival time ranged from one to 10 months (median, five months). In univariate analysis, the use of combined chemotherapy and a higher reirradiation dose showed a trend toward improved survival after reirradiation. Treatment-induced toxicity included grade 2 radiation pneumonitis in only one patient, and there were no other complications, such as radiation esophagitis or myelopathy. Conclusion(s): Reirradiation using 3D-CRT with moderate doses for locoregionally recurrent lung cancer can provide palliative benefits without severe complications to the majority of selected patients with symptoms as a result of a regrowing tumor. © 2014 Tianjin Lung Cancer Institute and Wiley Publishing Asia Pty Ltd.",Excluded
1578,"Effects of motion segment level, Pfirrmann intervertebral disc degeneration grade and gender on lumbar spine kinematics MRI allows non-invasive assessment of intervertebral disc degeneration with the added clinical benefit of using non-ionizing radiation. What has remained unclear is the relationship between assessed disc degeneration and lumbar spine kinematics. Kinematic outcomes of 54 multi-segment (L1-Sacrum) lumbar spine specimens were calculated to discover if such an underlying relationship exists with degeneration assessed using the Pfirrmann grading system. Further analyses were also conducted to determine if kinematic outcomes were affected by motion segment level, gender or applied compressive preload. Range of motion, hysteresis, high flexibility zone size and rotational stiffness in flexion-extension, lateral bending and axial rotation were the kinematic outcomes. Caudal intervertebral discs in our study sample were more degenerative than cranial discs. L5-S1 discs had the largest flexion-extension range of motion (p<0.005) and L1-L2 discs the lowest flexion high flexibility zone size (p<0.013). No other strict cranial-caudal differences in kinematic outcomes were found. Low flexibility zone rotational stiffness increased with disc degeneration grade in extension, lateral bending and axial rotation (p<0.001). Trends towards higher hysteresis and lower range of motion with increased degeneration were observed in flexion-extension and lateral bending. Applied compressive preload increased flexion-extension hysteresis and augmented the effect of degeneration on hysteresis (p<0.0005). Female specimens had about one degree larger range of motion in all rotational modes, and higher flexion extension hysteresis (p=0.016). These results suggest that gender differences exist in lumbar spine kinematics. Additionally high disc loads, applied compressive preload or applied moment, are needed to kinematically distinguish discs with different levels of degeneration.Copyright © 2016 Orthopaedic Research Society.

1920,"Occupational health hazards of working in the interventional laboratory: a multisite case control study of physicians and allied staff BACKGROUND: The occupational hazards of working in the interventional laboratory have been inadequately studied for physicians and remain unaddressed for nonphysician personnel., OBJECTIVES: This study sought to determine whether the prevalence of work-related musculoskeletal pain, cancer, and other medical conditions is higher among physicians and allied staff who work in interventional laboratories compared with employees who do not., METHODS: Mayo Clinic employees who work in affiliated hospitals with interventional cardiology or interventional radiology laboratories took an electronic survey. Results were stratified on the basis of self-reported occupational exposure to procedures that involve radiation., RESULTS: There were 1,543 employees (mean age 43 +/- 11.3 years, 33% male) who responded to the survey (response rate of 57%), and 1,042 (67.5%) reported being involved with procedures utilizing radiation. These employees reported experiencing work-related pain more often than the control group before (54.7% vs. 44.7%; p < 0.001) and after adjustment for age, sex, body mass index, pre-existing musculoskeletal conditions, years in profession, and job description (odds ratio: 1.67; 95% confidence interval: 1.32 to 2.11; p < 0.001). Musculoskeletal pain varied significantly by job description, with the highest incidence reported by technicians (62%) and nurses (60%) followed by attending physicians (44%) and trainees (19%; p < 0.001). There was no difference in cancer prevalence between groups (9% vs. 9%; p = 0.96)., CONCLUSIONS: Musculoskeletal pain is more common among healthcare workers who participate in interventional procedures and is highest in nonphysician employees. The diagnosis of cancer in employees who participate in procedures that utilize radiation was not elevated when compared to controls within the same departments, although any conclusion regarding causality is limited by the cross-sectional nature of the study, as well as the low overall prevalence of malignancy in our study group.

Light and transmission electron microscopy were performed on six corneal specimens., RESULTS: Clinical criteria for the diagnosis included a central, horizontally oval, corneal stromal haze with a ground glass appearance, a uniform or lamellar pattern, greater extent anteriorly and involvement of 50% to 100% of stromal thickness. It occurred bilaterally but sometimes asymmetrically. Density varied from mild to moderate and seldom decreased visual acuity. Sixteen (28%) of 58 corneas had additional degenerative lesions (spheroidal degeneration, mild calcific band keratopathy, and Salzmann's nodular degeneration). Refractile stromal lines or posterior white dots were present in six (10%) of 58 eyes. Videokeratography in 11 (29%) of 38 eyes demonstrated flat areas that overlay the stromal haze. Pathologic analysis demonstrated focal intracellular and extracellular deposits of excess proteoglycans. One specimen showed amyloid. We postulate that climatic factors play a pathogenic role because the disorder occurs in individuals who were exposed to the sunny, dry, dusty environment of the Middle East and because other corneal degenerative disorders were present concomitantly., CONCLUSIONS: Climatic proteoglycan stromal keratopathy is a corneal degeneration that appears as an oval, central, gray, ground-glass haze associated with central corneal flattening on videokeratography and as excess proteoglycans on histologic examination.

The most common dosage was 64 Gy in 2-Gy fractions 5 times a week, although a subgroup (of ca. bladder patients) were treated with 30-36 Gy in once-a-week 6 Gy fractions. Each patients completed a comprehensive acute toxicity scoring questionnaire concentrating on bowel and bladder problems, tiredness and nausea, before the start of treatment, weekly during and for 3 weeks after the end of treatment and then monthly for a further 2 months. compliance was excellent., RESULTS: There were no differences between the patients in the two arms with respect to age, gender, tumour type (52% prostate, 41% bladder, 5% rectum, 2% other) fractionation/dosage, anterior field size, weight, or baseline symptoms. Substantial differences in normal-tissue volumes (rectum, bladder, etc.) were achieved: median high-dose volume (HDV) of 689 cm3 for the conformal technique versus 792 cm3 for the conventional. A clear pattern of an increase in symptoms during RT, followed by a decrease after RT, was observed for the patient group as a whole. However, a very extensive analysis has not revealed any (statistically) significant differences between the two arms in level of symptoms, nor in medication prescribed. The disparity between our findings and those of other, non-randomized studies is discussed., CONCLUSIONS: The data on late effects must be collected and analyzed before any definite conclusions can be drawn on the benefits of conformal therapy in the pelvis.",Excluded

The outcomes of SABR for previously untreated solitary HCC unfit for ablation and surgical resection were evaluated. Method(s): Untreated solitary HCC patients treated with SABR were retrospectively studied. Between 2005 and 2012, 221 HCC patients underwent SABR. Among them, patients with untreated solitary HCC, treated with only SABR or SABR preceded by transarterial chemoembolization, were eligible. Based on baseline liver function and liver volume receiving >=20Gy, 35-40Gy in five fractions was prescribed to the planning target volume surface. Result(s): Sixty-three patients were eligible, with a median follow-up duration of 31.1 (range 12.0-88.1) months. No patients were lost to follow-up. Twenty patients were treated with only SABR. In 43 patients treated with SABR preceded by transarterial chemoembolization, accumulation of lipiodol in the tumor remained complete in five, a partial defect in 38 on pre-SABR computed tomography. The 1-, 2-, and 3-year local control rates were 100%, 95%, and 92%, respectively; the intrahepatic recurrence-free rates were 76%, 55%, and 36%, respectively; and the overall survival rates were 100%, 87%, and 73%, respectively.

Aim of the present study was to evaluate the feasibility of craniospinal irradiation with and without intrathecal chemotherapy and its efficacy with regard to symptom palliation and survival Patients and Methods: 16 patients (mean age 46 years; nine breast cancers, five lung cancers, one renal cell cancer, one tumor of unknown primary site) with leptomeningeal carcinomatosis occurring after a median interval from primary tumor diagnosis of 5 months (0-300 months) received craniospinal irradiation between October 1995 and May 2000. The median total dose was 36 Gy (a 1.6-2.0 Gy). Ten patients were additionally treated with intrathecal methotrexate (15 mg per cycle, 2-8 cycles). Result(s): Median survival was 12 weeks, 8 weeks after radiotherapy alone, 16 weeks after combined modality treatment. 14 patients died from disease. Eleven patients (68%) experienced regression of their neurological symptoms during or soon after completion of radiotherapy. Seven patients regained their ability to walk, six had pain reduction, three regression of bladder and bowel incontinence. In three patients symptom progression and in two patients no change occurred.

2244,"Impact of low dose myocardial perfusion imaging on patient radiation effective dose and imaging time in real world clinical practice Objectives To demonstrate proof of concept/practicality of reducing medical radiation exposure from myocardial perfusion imaging (MPI) by adopting low dose protocols in real world clinical practice. Methods A cohort of 100 consecutive patients who were referred for MPI to our nuclear medicine service was imaged with a low dose rest-stress MPI protocol. Traditionally used doses of 10 millicuries (mCi) or 370 megabecquerel (MBq) at rest and 30 mCi (1110 MBq) at stress were decreased to half for the low dose protocol, 5 mCi (185 MBq) at rest and 15 mCi (555MBq) at stress. This decision was based on the principle of lowering the injected dose as much as practically feasible while obtaining good diagnostic quality images with similar 1 million count threshold for image acquisition in a reasonable, patient comfortable imaging time [1]. All imaging was performed using an ultrafast, high resolution, dedicated cardiac camera (D-SPECT, Spectrum Dynamics) [2] in upright position for rest and stress. An additional supine stress image was additionally acquired [3]. The low dose patient cohort was retrospectively compared to a cohort of 100 consecutive patients referred to our service for MPI who were imaged using the traditional dose protocol immediately preceding the adoption of the low dose protocol. Comparison between the two groups in different protocols was made using the average values of administered doses in mCi, radiation effective dose in millisieverts (mSv) and the imaging time in minutes: seconds for each rest, stress and total MPI. All patients were imaged using a single day, rest-stress protocol with technetium99m-sestamibi using either exercise or pharmacological stress as determined clinically by the cardiology team. Results A total of 200 patients with 100 patients in each cohort were evaluated. Traditional dose patients had an average age of 69.8 years (y), male: female ratio of 59:41, weight of 85 kilograms (kg), received a dose of 10.4 mCi (385 MBq) at rest, 31.1 mCi (1151 MBq) at stress. Low dose patients had an average age of 66.6 y, male: female ratio of 52:48, weighed 83.3 kg, and received a dose of 5.28 mCi (195 MBq) at rest, 16.0 mCi (592 MBq) at stress. High dose imaging time in minutes: seconds was 8:17 (rest), 1:46 (stress) and 10:03 (total). Low dose imaging time was 14:36 (rest), 3:24 (stress) and 18:00 (total). As compared to traditional dose protocols, low dose protocols demonstrated significant reduction in average radiation effective dose of 49.1% in rest, 48.5% in stress and 48.7% in total rest-stress MPI. As expected, an increase in imaging time was noted in the low dose protocol, with an average increase of 07:20 min in rest, 03:14 min in stress and 10:34 min in total imaging time, which did not significantly impact patient throughput. No patient complaints were encountered with regards to imaging time by the imaging team. All images were of diagnostic quality, acquired by identical parameters of 1 million count threshold for image acquisition and deemed clinically interpretable by a team of board certified clinical nuclear medicine providers. Conclusions MPI contributes significantly to medical radiation exposure [4]. Low dose MPI can be easily implemented clinically using newer high resolution cardiac specific cameras to achieve markedly lower radiation effective doses to the patient population without significantly impacting patient throughput or diagnostic quality of images. Low dose MPI leads to decreasing medical radiation exposure to the patients, their caregivers, medical staff [5] and to the community as a whole.",Excluded
774,"Epidemiology and environmental risk in hairy cell leukemia Hairy cell leukaemia (HCL) is an orphan subtype of leukaemia which constitutes less than 2% of all leukaemia's, with an incidence of less than 1 per 100,000 persons per annum. Median age at presentation is 55 years and it is 3-4 times more frequent in males. It is also more frequently encountered in whites and less in Asians, Africans and Arabs. The epidemiologic data are multi-factorial and influenced by ethnicity and geographical factors. Other reported associations relate to some environmental exposures and possible occupational factors. Smoking appears to have an inverse correlation with the development of hairy cell leukaemia, while farming and exposure to pesticides, petroleum products, diesel and ionizing radiation have also been reported to be associated with an increased risk. National and international collaborative efforts are needed in order to undertake more extensive studies involving larger patient cohorts, aiming to determine the role of occupational and environmental risk factors in the development of this rare form of chronic leukaemia.Copyright © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

277,"Intestinal and colonic motor alterations associated with irradiation-induced diarrhoea in rats Localized application of ionizing radiation to the gastrointestinal tract frequently elicits responses, which include diarrhoea. The origin of this symptom is not clear but has been attributed to loss of epithelial integrity, together with alterations in motility and increased secretion. The purpose of this study was to examine whether a 10 Gy abdominal gamma irradiation leads to an inflammatory reaction, and to compare intestinal and colonic motility in controls and abdominally irradiated rats 1, 3 and 7 days after irradiation, using an electromyographic technique. The motility parameters analysed were the frequency and velocity of propagation of migrating myoelectric complexes (MMC) in the jejunum and colonic spike activity (long spike bursts; LSB) per 10 min in fasted rats. The MMC frequency was significantly reduced on days 1 and 7 after irradiation and the MMC pattern was markedly disrupted on day 3. The frequency of colonic LSB was significantly reduced on days 1, 3 and 7. Mouth to anus transit was significantly accelerated on day 3 only and diarrhoea was observed at this time. Myeloperoxidase activity in the jejunum and colon was also increased on this day only. It is concluded that irradiation-induced diarrhoea occurs contemporaneously with disruption of MMC in the small intestine.",Included

1296,"Validation of the cytokinesis-block micronucleus (CBMN) assay for use as a triage biological dosimetry tool Traditionally, the dicentric chromosome assay (DCA) has been used to derive biological dose estimates for unknown radiological exposures. While sensitive, this assay requires highly trained evaluators and is extremely time consuming. The cytokinesis-block micronucleus (CBMN) assay has been suggested as an alternative to the DCA, as it is much faster to evaluate samples and requires less technical expertise. In order to validate this assay for triage biodosimetry, dose-response curves were generated for six donors at eight doses of gamma-radiation (0-4.0 Gy). Each sample was evaluated by 12 individuals, among three different laboratories and the incidence of micronuclei was determined after counting 50-500 binucleated cells. This study demonstrated that the CBMN assay was capable of detecting radiation doses >or=1 Gy after scoring only 200 binucleated cells. As such, the CBMN assay may provide a sensitive and reliable technique for deployment as an initial screening tool in a large-scale radiological emergency where large numbers of biological dose estimates are required.",Included

We sought to determine whether the efficacy of chemotherapy could be improved by administering fluorouracil by protracted infusion throughout the duration of radiation therapy and whether the omission of semustine would reduce the toxicity and delayed complications of chemotherapy without decreasing its antitumor efficacy., METHODS: Six hundred sixty patients with TNM stage II or III rectal cancer received intermittent bolus injections or protracted venous infusions of fluorouracil during postoperative radiation to the pelvis. They also received systemic chemotherapy with semustine plus fluorouracil or with fluorouracil alone in a higher dose, administered before and after the pelvic irradiation., RESULTS: With a median follow-up of 46 months among surviving patients, patients who received a protracted infusion of fluorouracil had a significantly increased time to relapse (P = 0.01) and improved survival (P = 0.005). There was no evidence of a beneficial effect in the patients who received semustine plus fluorouracil., CONCLUSIONS: A protracted infusion of fluorouracil during pelvic irradiation improved the effect of combined-treatment postoperative adjuvant therapy in patients with high-risk rectal cancer. Semustine plus fluorouracil was not more effective than a higher dose of systemic fluorouracil given alone.",Excluded

These results suggest that GnRH agonist treatment given to azoospermic men after cytotoxic therapy for cancer may stimulate the recovery of spermatogenesis and fertility.",Excluded
319,"miRNA-95 mediates radioresistance in tumors by targeting the sphingolipid phosphatase SGPP1 Radiation resistance poses a major clinical challenge in cancer treatment, but little is known about how microRNA (miR) may regulate this phenomenon. In this study, we used next-generation sequencing to perform an unbiased comparison of miR expression in PC3 prostate cancer cells rendered resistant to fractionated radiation treatment. One miR candidate found to be upregulated by ionizing radiation was miR-95, the enforced expression of which promoted radiation resistance in a variety of cancer cells. miR-95 overexpression recapitulated an aggressive phenotype including increased cellular proliferation, deregulated G2-M checkpoint following ionizing radiation, and increased invasive potential. Using combined in silico prediction and microarray expression analyses, we identified and validated the sphingolipid phosphatase SGPP1, an antagonist of sphingosine-1-phosphate signaling, as a target of miR-95 that promotes radiation resistance. Consistent with this finding, cell treatment with FTY720, a clinically approved small molecule inhibitor of S1P signaling, sensitized miR-95 overexpressing cells to radiation treatment. In vivo assays extended the significance of these results, showing that miR-95 overexpression increased tumor growth and resistance to radiation treatment in tumor xenografts. Furthermore, reduced tumor necrosis and increased cellular proliferation were seen after radiation treatment of miR-95 overexpressing tumors compared with control tumors. Finally, miR-95 expression was increased in human prostate and breast cancer specimens compared with normal tissue. Together, our work reveals miR-95 expression as a critical determinant of radiation resistance in cancer cells.",Included
2910,"Infratentorial craniospinal irradiation for von Hippel-Lindau: A retrospective study supporting a new treatment for patients with CNS hemangioblastomas Patients with von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) syndrome with diffuse CNS hemangioblastomas have morbidity related to their disease and require a lifetime of surgical resections. Ninety-seven percent of tumors progress, and 5-year surgery rates are 20%-60%. Stereotactic radiosurgery and fractionated radiotherapy have had limited success. For the first time, we have used infratentorial craniospinal radiation therapy (ICSRT) for VHL patients with CNS hemangioblastomas. Consecutive VHL patients treated at the National Institutes of Health with radiographic evidence of hemangioblastomas were included if they received ICSRT. Patients underwent neurologic examinations and imaging at 3- to 12-month intervals. Seven patients with 84 hemangioblastomas met eligibility criteria. ICSRT was commonly administered to 43.2 Gy in 24 fractions. Mean pre-ICSRT tumor volume was 5.48 cm3. At a mean follow-up of 73.8 months, mean post-ICSRT tumor volume was 6.87 cm3, and 91 tumors were identified. Complete radiographic resolution was achieved in 17.9% of lesions. Although many patients were no longer optimal surgical candidates, only 4 surgeries were needed for symptomatic lesions after ICSRT, compared with 33 prior. Acute toxicity was mild and no patient developed grade >=1 late spinal cord toxicity according to the criteria of the Radiation Therapy Oncology Group/European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer, despite the high dose that the entire spinal cord received. Clinical and radiographic stability or resolution was demonstrated in the majority of tumors. Tumor growth rate in this study was less than reported in natural history studies, and the rate of surgical intervention was reduced. ICSRT was well tolerated, can decrease hemangioblastoma growth rate, and is a potential therapeutic option for VHL patients that warrants further investigation. © 2011 The Author(s).",Excluded
3168,"Tolerance of half-body irradiation as systemic therapy for patients with locally advanced breast cancer Background. Locally advanced breast cancer (LABC) is one of the main causes of cancer death among women in Bulgaria. In 1988, when this study started, there was still controversy about the role of chemotherapy in controlling systemic disease. There were encouraging results from the Radiation Therapy Oncology Group (RTOG) 82-06 study suggesting that half-body irradiation (HBI) should be used earlier in the disease course to prevent the development of metastases. There were many patients with LABC requiring treatment, but there was a problem with obtaining the drugs needed; they were expensive and not consistently available. Procedure. Taking into account the medical contraindications to chemotherapy treatment, its toxicity, and the possibility of chemoresistance, we initiated this study to look at the effects of HBI given as two fractions of 4 Gy to the upper and then lower parts of the body, after surgery and before local radiotherapy. Results. The acute tolerance of this regimen in 36 patients with LABC was as good as it was in 4 additional LABC patients with M1 disease, and hematologic recovery was satisfactory. Conclusions. We conclude that systemic treatment with HBI is tolerable. It therefore may be a convenient and cost-effective treatment for LABC, although better treatments are still needed.",Excluded
2619,"Tumour size in cancer of the cervix In a randomized trial comprising 204 patients with operable cervical carcinomas stages I and II, two low-dose rates in gynaecological brachytherapy were compared. Treatment consisted of Cs-137 uterovaginal application followed by surgery (either immediate or delayed). The results for the two dose rates have been published previously. The present paper concerns the correlation between outcome and tumour size. Tumour size was carefully estimated in two ways: by clinical examination under general anaesthesia and by measurements on the customized vaginal mould used for the brachytherapy. Ninety-one patients (45%) were classified as stage I, and 113 were classified as stage II proximal. The mean tumour size was 39 mm (range 15-64 mm). Cox's multivariate analysis indicated that the factors with a poor prognostic value were for survival: node involvement (N +) (p < 0.001), large tumour size (T +) (p < 0.001) and involvement of the endocervix (E +) (p <0.01); for event-free survival: N + (p <0.001), T + (p < 0.001); for local control; N + (p = 0.0001); for metastasis and regional relapse: N + (p < 0.001) and T + (p < 0.001). Stage was not a prognostic factor over the present range in either univariate or multivariate analysis. In this series tumour size is a powerful independent prognostic factor. It is therefore suggested that for the classification of cervical cancer and the indications for surgical staging and adjuvant treatment, tumour size should be taken into account.",Excluded
1002,"Radiation exposure of patients during 68Ga-DOTATOC PET/CT examinations Aim: Investigation of the biodistribution and calculation of dosimetry of Ga-68-DOTATOC- for patients imaged in the routine clinical setting for diagnosis or exclusion of neuroendocrine tumours. Patients, methods: Dynamic PET/CT-imaging (Biograph 16) was performed over 20 min in 14 patients (8 men, 6 women) after injection of (112 +/- 22) MBq 68Ga-DOTATOC followed by whole body 3D-acquisition (8 bed positions, 3 or 4 min each) 30 min p.i. and 120 min p.i.. Urinary tracer elimination was measured and blood activity was derived non-invasively from the blood pool of the heart. The relevant organs for dosimetry were spleen, kidneys, liver, adrenals, urinary bladder and pituitary gland. Dosimetry was performed using OLINDA/EXM 1.0 software and specific organ uptake was expressed as standardized uptake values (SUVs). Result(s): Rapid physiological uptake of the radiotracer could be demonstrated in liver, spleen and kidneys, adrenals and pituitary gland (mean SUVs were 6, 20, 16, 10, and 4, respectively). Radiotracer elimination was exclusively via urine (16% of injected dose within 2h); no redistribution could be observed. The spleen and the kidneys received the highest radiation exposure (0.24 mSv/MBq, 0.22 mSv/MBq resp.), mean effective dose yielded 0.023 mSv/MBq. Conclusion(s): 68Ga-DOTATOC is used extensively for diagnosis of somatostatin receptor positive tumours because it has several advantages over the 111In-labelled ligand. The derived dosimetric values are lower than first approximations from the biological data of OctreoScan. The use of CT for transmission correction of the PET data delivers radiation exposure up to 1 mSv (low dose). © Schattauer 2009.",Excluded
285,"Sonographic assessment of acute changes in plaque size and echogenicity and in intima-media thickness of carotid arteries after neck radiation therapy Ultrasonic assessment of acute changes in carotid artery walls before and after neck radiation therapy (RT). Fifty cancer patients scheduled for curative neck irradiation were included and underwent sonographic examination of carotid arteries, with assessment of intima-media thickness (IMT) and plaque size and echogenicity before and immediately after completion of RT. IMT was linearly correlated with age and before RT (r = 0.267, p = 0.007) and increased after RT (0.68 +/- 0.11 versus 0.87 +/- 0.16, p < 0.001), without correlation with total RT dose and protocol. New plaques (six hypoechoic, one hyperechoic, and one calcified) were found in eight patients after RT, while 17 of the 44 plaques that were present before RT increased in size, and 8 soft and 1 dense plaques in nine patients became calcified. Radiation in the acute phase not only increases the IMT but also causes new plaque formation and changes in plaque size and echogenicity. Copyright © 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",Excluded
1308,"Detection of pulmonary embolism with combined ventilation-perfusion SPECT and low-dose CT: head-to-head comparison with multidetector CT angiography UNLABELLED: The diagnosis of pulmonary embolism (PE) is usually established by a combination of clinical assessment, D-dimer testing, and imaging with either pulmonary ventilation-perfusion (V/Q) scintigraphy or pulmonary multidetector CT (MDCT) angiography. Both V/Q SPECT and MDCT angiography seem to have high diagnostic accuracy. However, only limited data directly comparing these 2 modalities are available. Hybrid gamma-camera/MDCT systems have been introduced and allow simultaneous 3-dimensional lung V/Q SPECT and MDCT angiography, suitable for diagnosing PE. The aim of our study was to compare, in a prospective design, the diagnostic ability of V/Q SPECT, V/Q SPECT combined with low-dose CT, and pulmonary MDCT angiography obtained simultaneously using a combined SPECT/MDCT scanner in patients suspected of having PE., METHODS: Consecutive patients from June 2006 to February 2008 suspected of having acute PE were referred to the Department of Nuclear Medicine at Rigshospitalet or Frederiksberg Hospital, Denmark, for V/Q SPECT as a first-line imaging procedure. The number of eligible patients was 196. Patients with positive D-dimer results (>0.5 mmol/mL) or a clinical assessment with a Wells score greater than 2 were included and underwent V/Q SPECT, low-dose CT, and pulmonary MDCT angiography in a single session. Patient follow-up was 6 mo., RESULTS: A total of 81 simultaneous studies were available for analysis, of which 38% were from patients with PE. V/Q SPECT had a sensitivity of 97% and a specificity of 88%. When low-dose CT was added, the sensitivity was still 97% and the specificity increased to 100%. Perfusion SPECT with low-dose CT had a sensitivity of 93% and a specificity of 51%. MDCT angiography alone had a sensitivity of 68% and a specificity of 100%., CONCLUSION: We conclude that V/Q SPECT in combination with low-dose CT without contrast enhancement has an excellent diagnostic performance and should therefore probably be considered first-line imaging in the work-up of PE in most cases.",Excluded
1797,"Radioprotective effects of exogenous glutathione against whole-body gamma-ray irradiation: age- and gender-related changes in malondialdehyde levels, superoxide dismutase and catalase activities in rat liver Age- and gender-related changes in malondialdehyde (MDA) levels, superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase (CAT) activities in rat livers exposed to different doses of whole-body gamma-ray radiation were determined. In addition, the effects of exogenous glutathione (GSH) against radiation injury in rat livers were investigated. We found that MDA levels have an age-associated increment and an increasing radiation dose-related elevation, although they decrease slightly in the 4 Gy group. The MDA levels in old rats were lower in males than in females, while those of young rats did not change. There were no observed age-related changes in SOD activities, although male rats had higher SOD activity than females. Female rats had the highest CAT activities in the 4 Gy group, while male rats had the highest CAT activities in the 6 Gy group. CAT activities in the 8 Gy group were lower than those of the 2 Gy group for each gender and age. While MDA levels were decreased and CAT activities increased by GSH, SOD activities remained unchanged. The results indicate that gamma-ray radiation affects gender- and age-dependent MDA levels, SOD and CAT activities. Administration of GSH appears to be a useful approach to reduce radiation injury by reducing MDA levels and increasing CAT activities.",Included
3709,"Online exhaled gas measurements for radiotherapy patients by proton transfer reaction mass spectrometry The present study assessed whether exhaled breath analysis using proton transfer reaction mass spectrometry (PTR-MS) could screen for radiation exposure. As the intensity of proton transfer reaction reagent ion H3(16)O(+) can be calculated with the intensity of H3(18)O(+), the intensity of H3(18)O(+) was monitored to observe the stability of the PTR-MS instrument during the experiment. The PTR-MS was applied for detecting the volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in the exhaled breath from 42 radiotherapy patients and other 61 patients who had not received radiotherapy. All patients were enrolled in the local cancer hospital. In the experiment, the subjects breathe slowly to the PTR-MS through a direct inlet system without any sampling bag or tube. The breath mass spectrometric data was statistically analyzed using Mann-Whitney U test and stepwise discriminant analysis to find the characteristic ions of radiation exposure. Receiver operating characteristics (ROC) analysis was applied for a combination of the characteristic ions. The PTR-MS instrument was stable as the intensity of reaction ion H3(16)O(+) was maintained in 1.1%. Through statistically analysis, we found 6 kinds of characteristic ions of radiation exposure, specifically mass-to-charge ratio (m/z) 93, m/z 41, m/z 102, m/z 79, m/z 131, and m/z 143.

837,"Radiation metabolomics. 5. Identification of urinary biomarkers of ionizing radiation exposure in nonhuman primates by mass spectrometry-based metabolomics Mass spectrometry-based metabolomics has previously demonstrated utility for identifying biomarkers of ionizing radiation exposure in cellular, mouse and rat in vivo radiation models. To provide a valuable link from small laboratory rodents to humans, gamma-radiation-induced urinary biomarkers were investigated using a nonhuman primate total-body-irradiation model. Mass spectrometry-based metabolomics approaches were applied to determine whether biomarkers could be identified, as well as the previously discovered rodent biomarkers of gamma radiation. Ultra-performance liquid chromatography-electrospray ionization quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry analysis was carried out on a time course of clean-catch urine samples collected from nonhuman primates (n = 6 per cohort) exposed to sham, 1.0, 3.5, 6.5 or 8.5 Gy doses of (60)Co gamma ray (~0.55 Gy/min) ionizing radiation. By multivariate data analysis, 13 biomarkers of radiation were discovered: N-acetyltaurine, isethionic acid, taurine, xanthine, hypoxanthine, uric acid, creatine, creatinine, tyrosol sulfate, 3-hydroxytyrosol sulfate, tyramine sulfate, N-acetylserotonin sulfate, and adipic acid. N-Acetyltaurine, isethionic acid, and taurine had previously been identified in rats, and taurine and xanthine in mice after ionizing radiation exposure. Mass spectrometry-based metabolomics has thus successfully revealed and verified urinary biomarkers of ionizing radiation exposure in the nonhuman primate for the first time, which indicates possible mechanisms for ionizing radiation injury.",Included

The sensitivity of the method was compared with chest radiography for detecting radiation-induced changes in the lung, regional alterations within (irradiated region) and outside (shielded region) the treatment ports, effect of irradiated lung volume, and dependence on time after radiotherapy., METHODS: Serial DTPA lung clearance studies were performed before the first radiation treatment (baseline), then weekly during a 5- to 7-wk course, and up to 12 times post-therapy over periods of 56-574 days. The total activity deposited in the lungs for each study was approximately 150 microCi (approximately 5.6 MBq). DTPA clearance, expressed in terms of the biological half-time, t 1/2, was computed from the slopes of the least-squares fit regression lines of the time-activity curves for the first 10 min for irradiated and shielded lung regions., RESULTS: Major findings include: (a) significant and early DTPA t 1/2 changes were observed in all patients during and after radiotherapy; (b) changes in DTPA t 1/2 values were observed in both irradiated and shielded lung regions in all patients suggesting a radiation-induced systemic reaction; (c) changes in DTPA t 1/2 values were correlated (p < 0.05) with the irradiated lung volumes; (d) significantly reduced DTPA t 1/2 values were observed in three patients who subsequently presented with clinical symptoms and/or radiographic changes consistent with radiation pneumonitis (t1/2 felt to 19% +/- 6% of baseline values, compared with 64% +/- 17% in the remaining patients [p < 0.01]); (e) the onset of decreased DTPA t 1/2 values in these three patients occurred 35-84 days before clinical symptoms and/or radiographic changes; and (f) DTPA t 1/2 tended to approach baseline values with time after radiotherapy, suggesting a long-term recovery in lung injury., CONCLUSION: These observations show significant and early alterations in DTPA lung clearance during and after radiotherapy that may provide a sensitive assay to monitor changes in radiation-induced lung injury and may facilitate early therapeutic intervention.",Included

Robotic radiosurgery was given with CyberKnife (Accuray Inc., Sunnyvale, CAl. There were 9 male and 8 female patients. Primary site was maxillary sinus in 6 patients, ethmoid sinus in 5 patients, nasal cavity in 3 patients and sphenoid sinus in 1 patient. Histopatholigal diagnosis was mostly squamous cell cancer (7 cases), as other pathologies were soft tissue sarcoma (4 cases), malignant melanoma (3 cases), adenocarcinoma (1 case), and adenoid cystic carcinoma (2 cases). RRS was given as re-Irradiation in 4 patients with recurrent disease, whereas it was primary treatment modality in 13 patients (RRS alone in 7 cases with 28.5-37.5 Gy in 3-5 fractions, and boost dose after EBRT in 6 cases with 1535 Gy in 35 fractions). The median prescription isodose was 81% (range, 75-85%). Seven patients received chemotherapy either prior to RRS (3 patients), or concurrent with EBRT (3 patients), or adjuvant (1 patient). Two cases with T4 tumors received elective neck EBRT. Result(s): Median follow-up time was 21 months (7-32 months). Complete response, partial response and stabile response was obtained in 7, 3 and 2 patients respectively. Overall response rate was 59% (Complete and partial response). Progression at primary site was observed in 3 cases, as one of them died of disease and two of them died of distant metastasis. RRS was generally well tolerated. There were no grade III-IV acute RTOG toxicity. Osteoradionecrosis was detected in 2 patients (one case receiving re-irradiat ion, other case receiving 30 Gy RRS alone in 3 fractions).

3414,"Host and tumor immunity: Local and systemic opportunities to enhance tumor curability by radiotherapy Success of radiation treatment depends on intrinsic properties of tumor cells, involvement of the host immune system and the crosstalk between tumor and host cells in primary and secondary (metastatic) sites. During the last decade our laboratory has investigated the role of these interactions in the ability of radiotherapy to eradicate primary tumors and metastatic disease. In the current presentation we will focus on host factors which interact with ionizing radiation (IR). The results of our studies using genetic models and specific immunological probes have identified CD8+ cytotoxic T cells, professional antigen presenting cells (CD11c+ dendritic cells), local production of TNFalpha by tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs), and host Type I Interferons (IFNs) as required for successful treatment by radiation 1,2. Transformation of the tumor microenvironment into an ""immunological hub"" to suppress local and distant disease is a tantalizing goal for which radiotherapy might be well suited, especially in combination with immunotherapy. , Our group has recently demonstrated that the combination of radiotherapy and anti-PD-L1 antibodies decrease accumulation and function of myeloid derived suppressor cells(CD11b,Gr1+) through enhanced local production of TNFalpha by tumor infiltrating lymphocytes ( TILs). in experimental systems3,4 The capacity of local radiotherapy to augment the activation TILs and drive cytokine production is, in part, due to the ability to increase tumor antigen cross-presentation by professional antigen presenting cells in the tumor stroma. Our group demonstrated host type I IFNs are essential for enhanced tumor antigen cross-presentation following radiotherapy. The critical role of type I IFNs in the host immune response to radiotherapy positions them as central components in the crosstalk between tumor cells and the host that can exert positive or negative influences depending on the context. In particular, the interaction of tumor cells with the host leads to the selection of clones resistant to the cytotoxic effects of IFNs and radiotherapy. Using transcriptomic approaches we identified a set of Interferon Stimulated Genes (ISGs) associated with tumor radioresistance.5 This gene set was identified in different types of primary tumors (lung, prostate, breast and glioblastoma) and termed the Interferon Related DNA Damage Signature (IRDS). Statistical training of this gene set detected a 7 gene signature which predicted response to adjuvant radio/chemotherapy for some woman with breast cancer 6. The IRDS is prognostic for patients with subsets of glioma and prostate cancer. We propose that these data indicate the presence of pro-survival genes in the IFN/Jak/Stat axis, which has been confirmed recently through a genomics approach The Jak-Stat pathway is currently under investigation as a potential therapeutic target for radio-chemosensitization in different tumor types. Our current approaches are directed towards identification of tumor ISGs with pro-survival/radioprotective functions. These results demonstrate the requirement to investigate both tumor and the host to improve the therapeutic ratio in radiotherapy.",Excluded

Methods Between January 2007 and August 2010, a cohort of consecutive EO patients who underwent coronary angiography was identified in our center's registry of angiography and percutaneous coronary intervention procedures. Of 21,103 procedures, 564 (2.7%) were performed in unique EO patients: 203 (36%) via the transradial approach; and 361 (64%) via the transfemoral approach.Results The primary outcome, a combined endpoint of major bleeding, access site complications, and nonaccess site complications, occurred in 7.5% of the transfemoral group and 2.0% of the transradial group (odds ratio [OR]: 0.30, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.10 to 0.88, p = 0.029), an endpoint driven by reductions in major bleeding (3.3% vs. 0.0%, OR: 0.12, 95% CI: 0 to 0.71, p = 0.015), as well as access site injuries (4.7% vs. 0.0%, OR: 0.08, 95% CI: 0 to 0.48, p = 0.002). There were no differences in nonaccess site complications (1.7% vs. 2.0%, OR: 1.50, 95% CI: 0.41 to 5.55), but transradial access procedures were associated with an increase in procedure time and patient radiation dose (p < 0.05).Conclusions Transfemoral access for coronary angiography and percutaneous coronary intervention was associated with more bleeding and access site complications when compared with a transradial approach.

2076,"Mouse spleen lymphocyte bactericidal and peroxidase activities: enhancement by whole body x-irradiation A 20,000 g pellet obtained from the homogenate of CD1 mouse spleen cells has measurable peroxidase and bactericidal activities. Whole body x-irradiation stimulates the in vitro peroxidative and bactericidal activities of the spleen cells. These cells do not phagocytize. However, addition of polystyrene latex particles to spleen cells from non- or x-irradiated mice, increases glucose oxidation. The extent of this stimulation (three- to fourfold) is less than that of PMN (six- to tenfold). Interaction between particles and lymphocyte surface may be the cause of this stimulation. The increased bactericidal activity due to x-ray is attributed mainly to an increase in the peroxidase activity of the lymphocytes. Surface (membrane) action rather than phagocytosis may be involved in the bactericidal process. The spleen lymphocyte peroxidase is distinct from myeloperoxidase in several respects.",Included

Uranium concentrations in drinking water varied from < 1 to 845 ppb. This nonin-vasive study relied on the measurement of a combination of urinary indicators of kidney function and markers for cell toxicity. In all, 54 individuals (12-73 years old) participated in the study. Correlation of uranium excreted in urine with bio-indicators at p <=.05 indicated interference with the kidney's reabsorptive function. Because of the community's concerns regarding cancer incidence, the authors also calculated cumulative radiation doses using uranium intake in drinking water over the preceding 15-year period. The highest total uranium intake over this period was 1,761 mg. The risk of cancer from the highest dose, 2.1 mSv, is 13 in 100,000, which would be difficult to detect in the community studied (population size = 1,480).

Two 3-day sperm broods were sampled for the former and two 4-day broods for the latter to detect damage induced in the most radiosensitive cells. F1 nondysgenic males derived from M female to M male crosses (controls) were treated identically. X-Y chromosome translocations induced by P element mobility alone declined sharply with a decrease in temperature (18 versus 21 degrees C) and they were significantly reduced with aging of hybrid males from brood 2, 4-8 days of age, to brood 3, 7-11 days of age. No significant increase in translocations was observed when X irradiation and P-M dysgenesis were combined, showing no interaction between damages induced by the two mutator systems. In contrast, interaction was observed in transmission ratio distortion which was significantly increased by X irradiation of hybrid males derived from both reciprocal M X P and P x M crosses. The preferential elimination of P element-bearing autosomes occurred when either spermatocytes or spermatids were irradiated.

Non-referred cases: nine out of 13 patients were women; median age at diagnosis 84 years. Eleven of the 13 patients died within 1 month of diagnosis. Referred cases: 42 out of 62 patients were women; median age 72 years; median survival 5.1 months; 1-year survival 19%. Forty-eight patients presented with tumours that extended through the thyroid capsule, 10 presented with distant metastases. Four patients had a total thyroidectomy, nine a partial thyroidectomy, and 49 a biopsy only. Fifty-seven patients received radiotherapy, nine of these had concurrent chemotherapy: Thirty-three patients received less than 40 Gy and 24 patients received 40 Gy or more. Median survival was longer (9 vs 3 months) in patients receiving 40 Gy or more; this group included four patients who had prolonged survival. Conclusion(s): Long-term, disease-free survival was achieved in a few patients who were able to receive high-dose radiotherapy, preferably after adequate surgery. © 2005 The Royal College of Radiologists.

1392,"Low-dose helical chest CT in asbestos-exposed workers in the Veneto Region: preliminary results PURPOSE: To evaluate the preliminary results of low-dose helical chest CT in a group of individuals with an occupational exposure to asbestos., MATERIALS AND METHODS: Between October 2000 and May 2004, 1,512 asymptomatic subjects, selected by Occupational Health physicians of the Veneto Region among those with a significant exposure to asbestos, underwent low-dose helical chest CT without contrast media administration. According to their features, all pulmonary nodules identified underwent pathology, further CT evaluation or follow-up with low-dose CT., RESULTS: Apart from benign pleural findings (in 40% of subjects), 590 pulmonary nodules were identified. Eleven nodules underwent pathologic examination, which detected 5 malignant lesions, and 51 were evaluated with other CT techniques, in all cases demonstrating benign features. In follow-up low-dose CT scans, performed in the remaining 528 nodules, a minimal increase in size occurred in 4 cases only., CONCLUSIONS: Screening for clinically relevant pulmonary lesions in asymptomatic people with occupational exposure to asbestos may be useful if rigorous enrollment criteria are adopted. The management of abnormal findings is cost-effective if it is based on the morphological features of each finding.",Excluded
2211,"Phase i dose-escalation study of stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) for poor surgical candidates with localized renal cell carcinoma Purpose To evaluate the tolerability of escalating doses of stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) for primary treatment of localized renal cell carcinoma (RCC) in poor surgical candidates. Patients and methods Eligible patients included those with clinically staged radiographic and or pathologically confirmed RCC who had not undergone previous abdominal or pelvic radiotherapy. All patients had comorbid medical conditions which precluded surgery. Median (range) patient age was 77.6 years (range 59-89) years and all patients had Karnofsky Performance Status of >=60. Median tumor volume was 57.9 cm3 (range 13.8-174.7 cm3). Dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) was defined as grade 3 or worse gastrointestinal/genitourinary toxicity by Common Terminology Criteria of Adverse Events (version 4). Tumor response was assessed by imaging results using Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors (RECIST) measurement and percutaneous biopsy. Results A total of 19 patients (13 men and 6 women) were treated on protocol from June 2006 through August 2011. Groups of 3-6 patients received 24, 32, 40, and 48 Gy in 4 fractions. Median (range) follow-up was 13. 7 months (5.9-34.7 months). For possibly treatment-related acute toxicities, one patient developed grade 2 fatigue and one developed grade 4 duodenal ulcer. For possibly treatment-related late toxicities, 2 patients experienced grade 3 renal toxicity (worsening chronic kidney disease), one reported grade 2 urinary incontinence and one developed grade 4 duodenal ulcer. Among the 15 patients with evaluable response, 3 and 12 had partial response and stable disease, respectively, utilizing RECIST criteria. Among the 11 patients who had post-SBRT biopsy, only one (9%) was negative on first biopsy and an additional one (9%) turned negative without further therapy on second biopsy. Conclusions Dose escalation to 48 Gy in 4 fractions has been achieved successfully without dose-limiting toxicities. A planned extension of this phase I trial is currently underway treating patients to 60 Gy in 3 fractions to further evaluate this experimental therapy.Copyright © 2015 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

1842,"Finger joint cartilage evaluated by ultrasound and X-ray in rheumatoid arthritis and control joints Background: Joint destruction in RA includes both bone and cartilage lesions. By X-ray examination, cartilage destruction is evaluated as a joint space narrowing (JSN). However, joint space narrowing is not a direct evaluation of cartilage. Objective(s): The aim of the study was to examine the finger joint cartilage by ultrasound (US) imaging and to compare it with JSN score in relation to clinical relevance. Method(s): We enrolled 27 RA patients in low disease activity or clinical remission (DAS28-CRP <2.7) and 21 healthy controls in this study. The cartilage thickness (CT) of metacarpophalangeal (MCP) and proximal interphalangeal (PIP) joints of 2nd to 5th fingers was bilaterally visualized and measured from a dorsal view, with approximately 90 degrees flexion. In addition, JSN of finger were scored by van der Heijde- modified Sharp method. Result(s): In patients with RA, CT in MCP joints ranged from 0.0 to 0.8 mm (median 0.4 mm), and CT in PIP ranged from 0.0 to 0.4mm (median 0.2mm), respectively. The sum of total CT from 8 fingers ranged from 2.7 to 6.8 mm (median 4.7 mm), and there was a significant difference in CT, but not in JSN score, between male and female patients (5.6 versus 4.6, respectively, p=0.005). Healthy controls had the sum of total CT significantly thicker as compared with RA (p<=0.001). Importantly, CT was well correlated with JSN (r=-0.696, p<0.001). Although CT was not correlated with age, disease duration, DAS28-CRP, functional disability score, positivity of rheumatoid factor and anti-CCP-antibody, CT was reduced in RA patients with elevated serum matrix metalloproteinase-3 (MMP-3) values compared with those with normal MMP-3 (3.9 versus 5.0, p=0.015). Conclusion(s): The US method of direct visualization and quantification of cartilage in MCP and PIP joints can be valid and useful in RA, and our results may support the importance of MMP-3 in the pathophysiology of cartilage destruction.",Excluded
1710,"Monte Carlo based estimation of organ and effective doses to patients undergoing hysterosalpingography and retrograde urethrography fluoroscopy procedures Contrast investigations of hysterosalpingography (HSG) and retrograde urethrography (RUG) fluoroscopy procedures remain the dominant diagnostic tools for the investigation of infertility in females and urethral strictures in males, respectively, owing to the scarcity and high cost of services of alternative diagnostic technologies. In light of the radiological risks associated with contrast based investigations of the genitourinary tract systems, there is a need to assess the magnitude of radiation burden imparted to patients undergoing HSG and RUG fluoroscopy procedures in Tanzania. The air kerma area product (KAP), fluoroscopy time, number of images, organ dose and effective dose to patients undergoing HSG and RUG procedures were obtained from four hospitals. The KAP was measured using a flat transmission ionization chamber, while the organ and effective doses were estimated using the knowledge of the patient characteristics, patient related exposure parameters, geometry of examination, KAP and Monte Carlo calculations (PCXMC). The median values of KAP for the HSG and RUG were 2.2 Gy cm2 and 3.3 Gy cm2, respectively. The median organ doses in the present study for the ovaries, urinary bladder and uterus for the HSG procedures, were 1.0 mGy, 4.0 mGy and 1.6 mGy, respectively, while for urinary bladder and testes of the RUG were 3.4 mGy and 5.9 mGy, respectively. The median values of effective doses for the HSG and RUG procedures were 0.65 mSv and 0.59 mSv, respectively. The median values of effective dose per hospital for the HSG and RUG procedures had a range of 1.6-2.8 mSv and 1.9-5.6 mSv, respectively, while the overall differences between individual effective doses across the four hospitals varied by factors of up to 22.0 and 46.7, respectively for the HSG and RUG procedures. The proposed diagnostic reference levels (DRLs) for the HSG and RUG were for KAP 2.8 Gy cm2 and 3.9 Gy cm2, for fluoroscopy time 0.8 min and 0.9 min, and for number of images 5 and 4, respectively. The suggested DRLs for the HSG and RUG procedures may be used by the radiology departments in Tanzania for management of attained dose levels until the national DRLs are established.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Ltd",Excluded
2463,"Radioresistant laryngeal cancers upregulate type 1 IGF receptor and exhibit increased cellular dependence on IGF and EGF signalling Objectives: Patients failing radiotherapy for laryngeal squamous cell carcinoma (LSCC) often require salvage total laryngectomy which has major functional consequences, highlighting a need for biomarkers of radiotherapy resistance. In other tumour types, radioresistance has been linked to epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and type 1 insulin-like growth factor receptor (IGF-1R). Here, we evaluated IGF-1R and EGFR as predictors and mediators of LSCC radioresistance. Design(s): We compared IGF-1R and EGFR immunohistochemical scores in patients with LSCC achieving long-term remission post-radiotherapy (n = 23), patients treated with primary laryngectomy (n = 22) or salvage laryngectomy following radiotherapy recurrence (n = 18). To model radioresistance in vitro, two LSCC cell lines underwent clinically relevant irradiation to 55 Gy in 2.75 Gy fractions. Result(s): Type 1 insulin-like growth factor receptor expression was higher in pre-treatment biopsies of radiotherapy failures compared with those in long-term remission and was upregulated post-radiotherapy. Patients undergoing primary laryngectomy had more advanced T/N stage and greater tumour IGF-1R content than those achieving long-term remission. Pre-treatment EGFR did not associate with radiotherapy outcomes but showed a trend to upregulation post-irradiation. In vitro, radiosensitivity was enhanced by inhibition of EGFR but not IGF. Repeated irradiation upregulated IGF-1R in BICR18 and SQ20B cells and EGFR in SQ20B, and enhanced SQ20B radioresistance. Repeatedly irradiated SQ20B_55 cells were not radiosensitised by inhibition of IGF and/or EGFR, but IGF-1R:EGFR co-inhibition suppressed baseline cell survival more effectively than blockade of either pathway alone, and more effectively than in parental cells. Conclusion(s): Radiation upregulates IGF-1R and may enhance IGF/EGFR dependence, suggesting that IGF/EGFR blockade may have activity in LSCCs that recur post-radiotherapy.Copyright © 2019 John Wiley & Sons Ltd",Excluded
2679,"Impact of radiation schedule and chemotherapy duration in definitive chemoradiotherapy regimen for esophageal cancer Impact of radiotherapy (RT) schedule on local response and duration of the 5-fluorouracil/cisplatin (5 FU/CDDP) chemotherapy (CT) on mare still questioning in chemoradiotherapy (CRT) regimen in esophageal carcinoma. Aim - Evaluate two RT schedules and two different CT durations by a retrospective comparison of the CRT regimens used by two centres between 1 994 and 2000. Methods - In centre I (regimen I), patients received 2 CT concomitantly to a continuous RT (50 Gy/25 fractions/5 weeks). In centre II (regimen II), patients received 6 CT, 3 were concomitant to a split course RT (20 Gy/10 fractions x 3 courses) and 3 CT were delivered after CRT. Results - A total of 129 patients were included, 74 in centre I and 55 in centre II respectively. Main patient characteristics were similar between the two groups. Clinical complete response to CRT was significantly more frequent in regimen I (83.8% vs 65.4%; P = 0.02). The median overall survival (OS) was 20 months in regimen I and 22 months in regimen II (NS). During follow-up, responder patients to CRT in regimen II experienced significant fewer metastasis (51.6% vs 27.8%; P = 0.03) with a trend to an increased 5-year survival (19.4% vs 11.3%) and OS (26.5 vs 21.0 months) (NS). Grade 3-4 toxicities were not different. Conclusion - Clinical complete response to CRT was significantly more frequent with a continuous RT whereas additional CT after CRT significantly reduced metastasis occurrence. CRT regimen in esophageal carcinoma may be more effective using a continuous RT schedule and additional CT courses after CRT completion. © Masson, 2006.",Excluded
2778,"Noninvasive Determination of Epidermal and Stratum Corneum Thickness in vivo Using Two-Photon Microscopy and Optical Coherence Tomography: Impact of Body Area, Age, and Gender Background: High-resolution images of the epidermis are important to understand the transdermal penetration and changes in epidermal components. Both ex vivo and in vivo technologies are available to picture the epidermal thickness (ET). So far, the illustration of the stratum corneum (SC) has not been possible without artifacts. Objective(s): Precision in vivo measurement of the ET and SC, duly considering the impact of location on the body, age, and gender. Method(s): In this pilot study on 20 skin-healthy subjects aged 18-66 years, the ET was imaged by two-photon microscopy (2PM) and optical coherence tomography (OCT), and the SC by using 2PM at five different body sites. Result(s): On solar-exposed body areas, both the epidermis and SC are thicker compared to solar-protected areas (p < 0.05), the epidermis at the gluteal region being the thickest (p < 0.05). The ET decreases with age (p < 0.05). Males show a thicker epidermis than females (p < 0.05). Conclusion(s): 2PM provides a noninvasive method for imaging the epidermis and especially the SC in vivo and is optimally suited for the application of histological criteria.Copyright © 2019 S.

330,"Experienced Mindfulness Meditators Exhibit Higher Parietal-Occipital EEG Gamma Activity during NREM Sleep Over the past several years meditation practice has gained increasing attention as a non-pharmacological intervention to provide health related benefits, from promoting general wellness to alleviating the symptoms of a variety of medical conditions. However, the effects of meditation training on brain activity still need to be fully characterized. Sleep provides a unique approach to explore the meditation-related plastic changes in brain function. In this study we performed sleep high-density electroencephalographic (hdEEG) recordings in long-term meditators (LTM) of Buddhist meditation practices (approximately 8700 mean hours of life practice) and meditation naive individuals. We found that LTM had increased parietal-occipital EEG gamma power during NREM sleep. This increase was specific for the gamma range (25-40 Hz), was not related to the level of spontaneous arousal during NREM and was positively correlated with the length of lifetime daily meditation practice. Altogether, these findings indicate that meditation practice produces measurable changes in spontaneous brain activity, and suggest that EEG gamma activity during sleep represents a sensitive measure of the long-lasting, plastic effects of meditative training on brain function. © 2013 Ferrarelli et al.",Excluded

2781,"The prostate cancer risk locus at 10q11 is associated with DNA repair capacity Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified several single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that mildly predict prostate cancer risk. These SNPs are local tagging markers for causal gene alterations. Consideration of candidate genes in the tagged regions would be facilitated by additional information on the particular pathomechanisms which contribute to the observed risk increase. In this study we test for an association of prostate cancer tagging SNPs with alterations in DNA repair capacity, a phenotype that is frequently involved in cancer predisposition. DNA repair capacity was assessed on blood lymphocytes from 128 healthy probands after ionizing irradiation. We used the micronucleus (MN) assay to determine the cellular DNA double-strand break repair capacity and flow cytometry to measure damage induced mitotic delay (MD). Probands were genotyped for a panel of 14 SNPs, each representing an independent prostate cancer risk locus previously identified by GWAS. Associations between germline variants and DNA repair capacity were found for the SNPs rs1512268 (8p21), rs6983267 (8q24) and rs10993994 (10q11). The most significant finding was an association of homozygous rs10993994 T-allele carriers with a lower MN frequency (. p=. 0.0003) and also a decreased MD index (. p=. 0.0353). Cells with prostate cancer risk alleles at rs10993994 seem to cope more efficiently with DNA double strand breaks (less MN) in a shorter time (decreased MD index). This intriguing finding imposes concern about the accuracy of repair, with respect to the cancer risk that is mediated by T genotypes. To date, . MSMB (microseminoprotein beta) is favored as the causal gene at the 10q11 risk locus, since it was the first candidate gene known to be expressionally altered by rs10993994. Based on the present observation, candidate genes from the contexts of DNA repair and apoptosis may be more promising targets for expression studies with respect to the rs10993994 genotype. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.",Excluded
1263,"The features of bone metabolism in patients with periodontal diseases Background The aim of this study is to investigate the relationship between bone metabolic disturbances and periodontal diseases Objectives Several studies discuss the relationship between systemic bone mineral density (BMD) and periodontal diseases. Osteoporosis or low systemic BMD should be considered as the risk factor for periodontal disease progression. The purpose of this study was to determine the impact of bone metabolism on the periodontal status in the patients. Methods The study included 89 patients (38 men and 51 women, mean age - 43.5+/-5.1 years) with the healthy periodontal status (HPS) and 231 patients (108 men and 123 women, mean age - 45.6+/-5.2 years) with generalized periodontitis (GP). Clinical conditions of periodontal tissue and radiographic determinations (panoramic X-Ray) were evaluated. Skeletal systemic BMD was measured by DXA. Metabolic processes of bone tissue were evaluated by bone turnover markers: bone tissue formation - osteocalcin (OC), bone-specific alkaline phosphatase (BAP) in serum and bone tissue resorption marker - deoxypiridinoline (DPD) in urine. Results Comparative analysis of structural and functional state of bone tissue in patients showed a mineral density reduction in GP group compared to HPS, but these changes were not statistically significant. Disorders of bone tissue metabolism and dissociation in the processes of bone tissue remodeling were determined in patients with GP. The OC level in the patients with GP (18.89+/-0.87 ng/ml in men and 20.39+/-1.14 ng/ml in women) was statistically significantly (p<0.01) lower compared to the HPS group (24.14+/-1.04 ng/ml in men and 27.56+/-1.12 ng/ml in women). BAP show significant differences between groups. The level of DPD in the GP group (5.78+/-0.79 mmol in men, 8.34+/-0.56 mmol in women) was significantly higher (p<0.01) compared to HPS group (3.57+/-1.12 mmol in men, 4.47+/-0.76 mmol in women).

Cases were those diagnosed with lung cancer over 6 years of follow-up (n = 108). Two controls, matched on age and sex, were selected for each case by incidence density sampling. Of the three polymorphisms, only the XRCC1 Arg280His allele was associated with increased lung cancer risk (odds ratio, 1.8; 95% confidence interval, 1.0-3.4) after adjustment for radon and tobacco exposure. In addition, individuals with the variant Arg280His allele who were alcohol drinkers seemed to be at higher risk for lung cancer compared with those with the homozygous wild-type genotype. Conversely, individuals with the variant Arg194Trp allele who were alcohol drinkers seemed to be at lower risk for lung cancer compared with those with the homozygous wild-type genotype.

1680,"Stereotactic body radiation therapy for lung metastases from soft tissue sarcoma Purpose: To appraise the role of stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) in patients with lung metastasis from primary soft tissue sarcoma. Method(s): Twenty-eight patients (51 lesions) were analysed. All patients were in good performance status (1-2 eastern cooperative oncology group (ECOG)), unsuitable for surgical resection, with controlled primary tumour and the number of lung metastases was <=4. In a risk adaptive scheme, the dose prescription was: 30 Gy/1 fr, 60 Gy/3 fr, 60 Gy/8 fr and 48 Gy/4 fr. Treatments were performed with Volumetric Modulated Arc Therapy. Clinical outcome was evaluated by thoracic and abdominal computed tomography (CT) scan before SBRT and than every 3 months. Toxicity was evaluated with Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) scale version 4.0. Result(s): Leiomyosarcoma (36%) and synovial sarcoma (25%) were the most common histologies. Five patients (18%) initially presented with pulmonary metastasis, whereas 23 (82%) developed them at a median time of 51 months (range 11-311 months) from the initial diagnosis. The median follow-up time from initial diagnosis was 65 months (5-139 months) and from SBRT was 21 months (2-80 months). No severe toxicity (grades III-IV) was recorded and no patients required hospitalisation. The actuarial 5-years local control rate (from SBRT treatment) was 96%. Overall survival at 2 and 5 years was 96.2% and 60.5%, respectively. At last follow-up 15 patients (54%) were alive. All other died because of distant progression. Conclusion(s): SBRT provides excellent local control of pulmonary metastasis from soft tissue sarcoma (STS) and may improve survival in selected patients.

963,"High incidence of mosaic mutations induced by irradiating paternal germ cells of the medaka fish, Oryzias latipes Delayed-type mutations induced by radiation have recently been demonstrated in various somatic-cell systems. Such mutations are thought to result from the transmission of genetic instability through many cell divisions subsequent to a single exposure to ionizing radiation. Here, we have examined whether 'transgenerational' delayed-type mutations can arise during embryonic development of the medaka fish as a result of exposing the sperm and spermatids of live fish to 137 Cs gamma-radiation. To do this, we made use of a sensitive specific-locus test (SLT) for the medaka that we have recently developed. Because the medaka has a transparent egg membrane and embryo body, both visible mosaics and whole-body mutations can be detected during development at an early-expressed pigmentation locus. When wild-type +/+ males were gamma-irradiated and then mated with wl/wl females, the frequency of F1 embryos with both wild-type orange leucophores (wl/+) and mutant-type white leucophores (wl/wl*) (mosaic mutants) was about 5.7 x 10-3/Gy. The frequency of embryos with only white leucophores (whole-body mutants) was about 1.3 x 10-3/Gy. These results suggest that delayed mutations frequently arise in medaka fish embryos that have been fertilized with irradiated sperm. Some possible mechanisms involved in the generation of these delayed mutational events (including genomic instability in the early embryos) are discussed. © 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.",Excluded

We evaluate the efficacy and safety of CyberKnife treatment in the management of metastatic cancer to the pituitary grand. PATIENTS 13 pituitary metastases (male 6, female 7). Age 47y-69y (median 53y). KPS 70. No previous irradiation. METHOD(S): Treatment system: CyberKnife (G3 or G4), Planning system: On target, Multiplan (Accuray), Calculation model: Ray tracing, Inverse algorithm, Immobilaization: thermoplastic mask, Image: CECT 1mm in thickness + MRI Gd T1WI 1-3mm in thickness, PTV = CTV = GTV, Verification: TLS (Target locating system), 6 axis correction. TREATMENT PROTOCOL: Marginal dose: D95PTV 95%, iso-dose line 80% (goal), Fractions: tumor size, adjacent to OAR (organs at risk), Tolerable dose of optic appratus: 12Gy (SRS), 21Gy (3fr.), 25Gy (5fr.), 28Gy (7fr.).

This study assessed the utility of dual-energy pulmonary CT angiography (CTA) for noninvasive assessment of regional pulmonary perfusion in patients with chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension (CTEPH). Regional perfusion abnormalities were correlated with hemodynamic parameters and structural abnormalities on pulmonary CTA. SUBJECTS and methods. Twenty patients with CTEPH (11 men and nine women; mean age, 61.5 years) underwent pulmonary CTA with a dual-energy technique. Right heart catheterization data were available in 15 cases. Scan parameters were as follows: tube A, 140 kV (75 mA); tube B, 80 kV (300 mA); gantry rotation, 500 milliseconds; pitch, 0.5; and collimation, 14 x 1.2 mm. An iodine map was generated via three-material- decomposition and was scored for extent of hypoperfusion. Correlation was made with mosaic attenuation pattern, extent of vascular obstruction, and right heart hemodynamics. Iodine attenuation values were analyzed within completely occluded, partially occluded, and disease-free lobes. Results . A strong correlation existed between dual-energy CT-derived perfusion and mosaic attenuation pattern when both lobar (r > 0.6; n = 20; p < 0.006) and whole-lung scores were assessed (r = 0.77; n = 20; p < 0.001). There was no statistically significant correlation between dual-energy CT perfusion and vascular obstructive index, mean pulmonary artery pressure, or pulmonary vascular resistance (p > 0.08). Of 42 completely occluded lobes, 27 (64%) had demonstrable residual perfusion (mismatching), suggesting that blood supply was maintained via systemic collaterals. Conclusion. Dual-energy CT can offer a ""one-stop"" assessment of anatomy and perfusion in CTEPH.

1421,"Single-nucleotide polymorphisms in the p53 pathway A cell culture assay has been developed that detects and validates single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in genes that populate the p53 pathway. One hundred thirteen EBV-transformed human B-lymphocyte cell lines obtained from a diverse population were employed to measure the apoptotic response to gamma radiation. Each cell line undergoes a reproducible, characteristic frequency of apoptosis, and the response of the population forms a normal distribution around a median of 35.5% apoptosis with a range from 12% to 58% apoptosis. Polymorphisms in the AKT1 and Perp genes significantly affect the frequency of apoptosis. The assay can detect both racial and sexual dimorphisms in these genes and has the ability to demonstrate epistatic relationships within the p53 pathway.

1446,"A study on radiation dose received by patients during extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy Background: Extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy (ESWL) is considered as the method of choice for treatment of most stone diseases. The present study aims to evaluate radiation dose received by patients undergoing ESWL. Method(s): In total, 46 patients from both genders were referred to the Shohadaye Ashayer hospital of Khorramabad, Iran and were included in the present study. Patients were positioned in anteroposterior (AP) projection and along 30degree anterior oblique (AO) projection upon the X-ray fluoroscopy table and exposures were conducted. Thermoluminescent dosimeters (TLDs) were used for radiation dose measurements. To evaluate the entrance surface dose (ESD), each TLD chip was taped on back of patient at the entrance surfaces of the X-ray beam. Result(s): The mean number of stones in each patient was 1.4. The stone sizes ranged from 7 to 29 mm, and a mean of 3200 pulses were need for each patient. The mean ESD in the postero-anterior (PA) and oblique X-ray beam entrance were obtained at 12.04 and 68.84 mGy, respectively. There was linear correlation between patient dose with fluoroscopy time, tube current (mA), tube potential (kVp) and patient position (P < 0.001); however, we found no strong correlation between patient dose with patient body mass (P = 0.837), number of shock wave pulses (P = 0.089), stone size (P = 0.773) and locations (P = 0.463). Conclusion(s): The data obtained in the current study are comparable with information available in the literature. They emphasized that ESWL exposes patients to much more radiation compared to those from conventional radiography and is in the range of computed tomography (CT) procedures. Therefore, following safety guidelines is recommended.Copyright © 2018 The Author(s).",Excluded
2367,"Tumor heterogeneity determined with a gammaH2AX foci assay: A study in human head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (hHNSCC) models Purpose This study aimed to analyze the intra-tumoral heterogeneity of gammaH2AX foci in tumor specimens following ex vivo radiation to evaluate the potential of gammaH2AX foci as predictors for radiosensitivity. Material and methods gammaH2AX foci were quantified in tumor specimens of 3 hHNSCC tumor models with known differences in radiosensitivity after reoxygenation in culture medium (10 h, 24 h), single dose exposure (0 Gy, 4 Gy), and fixation 24 h post-irradiation. Multiple, equally treated samples of the same tumor were analyzed for foci, normalized and fitted in a linear mixed-effects model. Results The ex vivo reoxygenation time had no significant effect on gammaH2AX foci counts. A significant intra model heterogeneity could be shown for FaDu (p = 0.033) but not for SKX (p = 0.167) and UT-SCC-5 (p = 0.082) tumors, respectively. All tumor models showed a significant intra-tumoral heterogeneity between specimens of the same tumor (p < 0.01) or among microscopic fields of a particular tumor specimen (p < 0.0001). Conclusion Similar results for ex vivo gammaH2AX foci between 10 h and 24 h reoxygenation time support the applicability of the assay in a clinical setting. The high intra-tumoral heterogeneity underlines the necessity of multiple analyzable samples per patient and therewith the need for an automated foci analysis.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",Excluded
2850,"Noonan syndrome and glioneuronal tumors: A central nervous system cancer predisposition association? BACKGROUND: Noonan syndrome (NS) is associated with germline Ras signaling pathway mutations, RAS overactivation and increased tumorigenesis risk. Rosette-forming glioneuronal tumors (RFGT) are rare indolent tumors. We report the molecular profiling of two patients with NS and RFGT. PATIENT 1: A 22-year-old male with NS was diagnosed with RFGT after partial tumor resection followed by focal irradiation. He was enrolled on a comprehensive genomic profiling study involving paired tumor-normal whole exome sequencing and RNA sequencing of the disease-involved tissue, revealing a germline PTPN11 alteration (p.Gly60Ala) consistent with NS, and a somatic deletion (p.Ile442-Thr454del) in PIK3R1 and a somatic variant (p.Lys656Glu) in FGFR1 with concomitant increased expression of PIK3R1 and FGFR1 by RNA-sequencing. The patient remains without tumor progression now nine months since irradiation. PATIENT 2: A 19-year-old male with persistent headaches, underwent a brain MRI demonstrated multiple abnormal signals in the pineal region and midbrain. He had a stereotactic biopsy revealing RFGT. He was enrolled on the genomic study revealing a germline PTPN11 alteration (p.Asn308Asp) resulting in a new diagnosis of NS. Several family members were subsequently identified with clinical features of NS, including his mother and two siblings, enabling appropriate counseling. Two somatic variants were found in trans in PIK3R1 (p.Thr454-Phe456del and p.Glu451-Asn453delinsAsp), and a somatic variant (p.Val695Met) in FGFR1, with resultant overexpression of PIK3R1. The patient is monitored with surveillance imaging. CONCLUSION(S): We report the molecular profiling of two patients with NS and RFGT; strongly suggesting their connection to RASopathies through the overactivation of the MAPK and PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathways.",Excluded

1386,"Impact of Endovascular Technique on Fluoroscopy Usage: Stent-Assisted Coiling versus Flow Diversion for Paraclinoid Internal Carotid Artery Aneurysms Flow diversion is increasingly being utilized for the treatment of internal carotid artery (ICA) aneurysms. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the impact of endovascular technique--flow diversion versus stent-assisted coiling (SAC) on fluoroscopy time in patients treated for wide-neck paraclinoid ICA aneurysms. A retrospective review identified the 20 most recent consecutive patients treated for wide-neck paraclinoid ICA aneurysms by flow diversion and SAC respectively. Fluoroscopy time, cumulative dose area-product (DAP), contrast usage, intra-procedural complications, and total procedure time were collected and compared between the two treatment techniques. Treatment groups were comparable in terms of demographics, contrast usage, and clinical and angiographic outcomes. Flow diversion was associated with a significant reduction in fluoroscopy time (52.0 minutes versus 77.4 minutes), and demonstrated a strong trend towards shorter total procedure time (172 minutes versus 202 minutes). Average patient radiation exposure as measured by DAP was lower in the flow diversion group, 13225 mGy(x)cm(2) versus 15124 mGy(x)cm(2), although this finding was not statistically significant. There was no significant difference in contrast usage between the two groups, 152 ml and 159 (flow diversion and SAC respectively). The rate of complete aneurysm occlusion was higher in the flow diversion group (80% versus 60%). Endovascular treatment of paraclinoid ICA aneurysms with flow diversion is associated with shorter fluoroscopy times compared to stent-assisted coiling. There is also a likely reduction in overall procedure time. These results should be considered when recommending a treatment course for patients with such lesions.",Excluded

We randomized 50 patients with primary knee osteoarthritis into 2 groups. We used CT scan axial images to measure the PCA. In the first group we followed the CT scan plan (group 1), but in the second we did not follow the plan and adjusted rotation to the standard three degrees (group 2). The mean age of the included patients was 63 years. The radiological data of the included patients showed 5 patients with valgus deformity and 45 patients with varus deformity with the mean coronal alignment of 7.5 degrees. CT scan showed the mean PCA of 3.7 degrees (1.3 degrees). The axial knee postoperative X-ray showed the mean patellar tilt angle of 2.1 degrees (0.5 degrees) and 1.9 degrees (0.5 degrees) in groups 1 and 2, respectively. The congruence angle was 4 degrees (2.6 degrees) in group 1 and 5.5 degrees (3.2 degrees) in group 2. The median Knee Society functional score in group 1 was 85 (12), while it was 84 (7.5) in group 2. The median postoperative Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Arthritis Index score in group 1 was 84 (18.6) whereas 80.2 (13.6) in group 2.

93,"Cervical lymphatic metastases from occult primary tumor. A nation-wide 20-year study from the Danish society of head and neck oncology INTRODUCTION: The management of patients with cervical lymph node metastases from unknown primary tumours is a major challenge in oncology. This study presents data collected from all five oncology centres in Denmark. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Of the 352 consecutive patients with squamous cell or undifferentiated tumours seen from 1975 to 1995, a total of 277 (79%) were treated with radical intent. Most patients received radiotherapy to both sides of the neck as well as elective irradiation of the mucosal sites in nasopharynx, oropharynx, hypopharynx and larynx (81%). Irradiation of the ipsilateral neck only was done in 26 patients (10%). Radical surgery was the only treatment in 23 N1-N2 patients (9%). RESULT(S): The five-year estimates of neck control, disease-specific survival and overall survival for radically treated patients were 51%, 48% and 36%, respectively. The emergence of the occult primary was observed in 66 patients (19%). About half of the emerging primaries were within the head and neck region with oropharynx, hypopharynx and oral cavity being the most common sites. Emerging primaries outside the head and neck region were primarily located in the lung (19 patients) and oesophagus (five patients). The most important factor for neck control was nodal stage (5-year estimates 69% [N1], 58% [N2] and 30% [N3]). Other important parameters for neck control and disease-specific survival included haemoglobin, gender and overall treatment time. Patients treated with ipsilateral radiotherapy had a relative risk of recurrence in the head and neck region of 1.9 compared to patients treated at both neck and mucosa. At five years, the estimated control rates were 27% (ipsilateral) and 51% (bilateral; p = 0.05). The 5-year disease-specific survival estimates were 28% and 45%, respectively (p = 0.10). DISCUSSION: Extensive irradiation to both sides of the neck and the mucosa in the entire pharyngeal axis and larynx resulted in significantly fewer loco-regional failures compared to patients treated with ipsilateral techniques, but only a trend towards better survival. Determination of the optimal strategy in terms of loco-regional control, survival and morbidity requires a prospective randomized trial.",Excluded
3363,"Single-balloon versus double-balloon bipedicular kyphoplasty for osteoporotic vertebral compression fractures Twenty-eight patients with osteoporotic vertebral compression fractures (OVCF) were treated with single-balloon bipedicular kyphoplasty (Group A), and 40 patients were treated with double-balloon bipedicular kyphoplasty (Group B). Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) score, vertebral height, and kyphotic angle (KA) were evaluated pre-operatively, post-operatively (3 days after surgery) and at final follow-up. Operative time, X-ray exposure frequency and costs were recorded. The mean operative time and X-ray exposure frequency in Group A were greater than in Group B (p < 0.05). Significant improvement of the VAS score was noted in each group, and remained unchanged at final follow-up. Mean increases of anterior and middle height of the fractured vertebral body were 5.14 mm and 4.14 mm in Group A, respectively, and 6.22 mm and 5.06 mm in Group B, respectively, and the differences between the groups were statistically significant (p < 0.05). Mean reduction of KA was 6.9degree in Group A and 8.8degree in Group B, which was statistically significant (p < 0.05). No statistically significant difference was observed in terms of cement leakage between groups. The mean cost of Group A (US$4202) was significantly less than that of Group B (US$6220) (p < 0.001). Single-balloon bipedicular kyphoplasty is a safe and cost-effective surgical method for the treatment of OVCF. It can achieve pain relief comparable with double-balloon bipedicular kyphoplasty. However, double-balloon bipedicular kyphoplasty is more efficacious in terms of the restoration of vertebral height and reduction of KA, and the operative time and X-ray exposure frequency are lower.Copyright © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

3284,"Effects of gamma irradiation on mechanical properties of defatted trabecular bone allografts assessed by speed-of-sound measurement New sterilization methods for human bone allografts may lead to alterations in bone mechanical properties, which strongly influence short- and medium-term outcomes. In many sterilization procedures, bone allografts are subjected to gamma irradiation, usually with 25 KGy, after treatment and packaging. We used speed-of-sound (SOS) measurements to evaluate the effects of gamma irradiation on bone. All bone specimens were subjected to the same microbial inactivation procedure. They were then separated into three groups, of which one was treated and not irradiated and two were exposed to 10 and 25 KGy of gamma radiation, respectively. SOS was measured using high- and low-frequency ultrasound beams in each orthogonal direction. SOS and Young modulus were altered significantly in the three groups, compared to native untreated bone. Exposure to 10 or 25 KGy had no noticeable effect on the study variables. The impact of irradiation was small compared to the effects of physical or chemical defatting. Reducing the radiation dose used in everyday practice failed to improve graft mechanical properties in this study. © Springer Science+Business Media, Inc. 2006.",Included
2127,"Dynamic visual acuity during walking after long-duration spacefl ight Introduction: Astronauts experience alterations in gaze control as a result of adaptive changes in eye-head coordination produced by microgravity exposure. This may lead to potential changes in postfl ight visual acuity during head and body motion. Method(s): We gathered dynamic visual acuity (DVA) data from 14 astronauts and cosmonauts after longduration (~6 mo) stays in space. Walking was used to induce self-motion and visual acuity was determined by sequentially presenting Landolt ring optotypes on a computer display placed 4 m in front of subjects. Acuity assessments were made while seated (static condition) and walking (dynamic condition) at 6.4 km . h-1 on a motorized treadmill. In each condition, a psychophysical threshold detection algorithm minimized the required number of optotype presentations by maximizing the amount displayed around the subject's acuity threshold. The difference between static and dynamic acuity measures provided a metric of change in the subjects' ability to maintain gaze fi xation on the visual target while walking. Result(s): A decrement in postfl ight visual acuity during walking was found. A mean dynamic acuity decrement of approximately 0.75 eye-chart lines was observed 1 d after returning from space. The population mean showed a consistent improvement in DVA performance during the fi rst postfl ight week. Discussion(s): The recovery curves for individual subjects did not necessarily follow a pattern of continuous improvement with each passing day. When adjusted for previous long-duration fl ight experience, the population mean showed an unexpected DVA reduction in the re-adaptation curve that is similar to recovery patterns observed in prism adaptation studies.",Excluded
705,"Assessment of radiation-induced liver injury with computed tomography OBJECTIVE: To review the appearance of radiation-induced liver injury on computer tomography for quantitative assessment of dosimetric changes in different radiological reactions and the influence of time-effect. METHOD(S): The focal liver reactions of 35 patients treated with three-dimensional conformal radiation therapy (3-D CRT) for liver malignancies were evaluated, with the applied doses of 36-65 Gy in 4-28 fractions completed in 8-41 days. All patients received nonenhanced CT scan and arterial-dominant phase contrast-enhanced CT scan 1-6 months after therapy. The liver tissue density in irradiated and nonirradiated liver was compared, and the reaction type and the threshold dose determined radiologically. RESULT(S): On at least one follow-up examination, 51.4% of patients were found to have a focal radiation reaction in the liver. The radiation reaction was hypodense in 43.75% of the follow-up nonenhanced CT examinations and in 19.23% of arterial-dominant phase contrast-enhanced CT scans. It was hyperdense in 42.31% of arterial-dominant phase contrast-enhanced CT scans. The median threshold dose inducing a radiation reaction was 30.8 Gy (range 18-42.8 Gy). The detected threshold dose was positively correlated with the time of detection of the reaction (P=0.041), with a correlation coefficient of -0.473. On arterial-dominant phase contrast-enhanced CT scans, the threshold dose was significantly higher for hyperdense than for hypodense changes (P=0.017). In additional follow-up, the reaction volume decreased and the reaction types changed on arterial-dominant phase contrast-enhanced CT scans. CONCLUSION(S): The threshold dose can be different in different radiological reaction types on multiphase CT scans. The detected threshold dose is inversely correlated with the time of detection of the early reaction. Multiphase contrast-enhanced CT is helpful to distinguish radiation reactions from recurrent tumors.",Excluded

Most of the patients could be omitted for abdominal computed tomography (CT). Despite high sensitivity and specificity of abdominal CT, in addition to high medical cost, there are risks from radiation exposure and adverse reaction from use of contrast media. Objective(s): To evaluate the prevalence of KUB injury on abdominal CT in case of hemodynamically stable blunt abdominal injury with microscopic hematuria. Material(s) and Method(s): Forty-one studies of abdominal CT performed during 1 January 2010 and 30 June 2012 were retrospectively reviewed for KUB injury (categorized by AAST organ injury scale) by consensus of two experienced radiologists. Result(s): KUB injury was found in 36.6% from all selected CT studies. Almost all cases could be managed conservatively. The cutoff point of microscopic hematuria at 20 cells/hpf has sensitivity 80% and specificity 46.15%. Conclusion(s): One-third of the patients have KUB injury but almost all of them could be conservatively managed. We proposed that the cutoff point of hematuria be equivalent to or greater than 20 cells/hpf to be one of the indicators for predicting KUB injury that needs radiological evaluation; but it should be carefully considered along with clinical information.Copyright © 2015 Medical Association of Thailand.

1071,"Urolithiasis and Frequent CT Scans: Does Chronic Pain Play a Role? INTRODUCTION: Urolithiasis is among the top 10 causes of Emergency Department (ED) visits in the United States. Approximately 50% of these patients undergo abdominopelvic CT scan, many more than once. We hypothesized that chronic pain conditions may contribute to frequent CT scans in patients who are evaluated in ED for urolithiasis., METHODS: A retrospective review of patients presenting to our tertiary care and the associated satellite EDs for urolithiasis, during the period 12/2012-05/2013, was performed. Patients with multiple ED visits and two or more abdominopelvic CT scans in any 6-month period were labeled as the frequent CT group. Control group consisted of similar patients who had no more than one CT scan in any 6-month period. Background information, number of CT scans for urolithiasis and other reasons, and the presence of chronic pain (established pain clinic visits, chronic pain medication, known chronic pain syndromes) were captured from charts. Wilcoxon rank-sum test and Fisher's exact test were used to compare variables. Multivariable logistic regression was performed to identify predictors associated with frequent CT scans., RESULTS: We identified 185 patients with frequent CTs and 139 patients in the control arm. Frequent CT scans were independently associated with chronic pain (odds ratio [OR]: 2.67, confidence interval [95% CI]: 1.55, 4.50), age (OR: 0.73, 95% CI: 0.60, 0.89), history of prior urolithiasis (OR: 2.15, 95% CI: 1.11, 4.15), and Medicaid insurance status (OR: 3.94, 95% CI: 1.66, 9.35)., CONCLUSION: Chronic pain is a significant contributing factor to frequent CT scans among patients presenting to ED with urolithiasis, leading to increased radiation exposure and healthcare costs.",Excluded

1,"Modifying Effect of Chronic Atrophic Gastritis on Radiation Risk for Noncardia Gastric Cancer According to Histological Type The findings from previously published studies have suggested that radiation exposure is associated with increased mortality and incidence of gastric cancer. However, few cohort studies have incorporated risk factors such as Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) infection or chronic atrophic gastritis (CAG). The current study is aimed at evaluating the modifying effect of CAG on radiation risk of noncardia gastric cancer by histological type, by reanalyzing data from a nested case-control study conducted within the longitudinal clinical cohort of atomic bomb survivors. The analysis was restricted to 297 intestinal- or diffuse-type noncardia cases and 873 controls rematched to the cases on gender, age, city, and time and type of serum storage, and countermatched on radiation dose. Multivariable-adjusted relative risks [95% confidence interval (CI)] of noncardia gastric cancer were 3.9 (2.1-7.2) for H. pylori IgG seropositivity with cytotoxin-associated gene A (CagA) IgG low titer, 2.6 (1.9-3.6) for CAG, 1.9 (1.3-2.8) for current smoking, and 1.4 (1.1-1.9) for 1 Gy irradiation. Among subjects without CAG, the relative risk (95% CI) of noncardia gastric cancer at 1 Gy was 2.3 (1.4-3.7), whereas relative risk (95% CI) at 1 Gy was 1.1 (0.8-1.5) among subjects with CAG (for the overall interaction, P = 0.012). By histological type, the risk at 1 Gy was high for diffuse type without CAG, with adjusted relative risk (95% CI) of 3.8 (2.0-7.6), but was not high for diffuse type with CAG or for intestinal-type irrespective of CAG status. The results indicate that radiation exposure is associated with increased risk of diffuse-type noncardia gastric cancer without CAG, and this association exists despite adjustment for H. pylori infection and smoking habit.

2610,"DNA damage and repair of head and neck cancer cells after radio- and chemotherapy DNA repair is critical for successful chemo- and radiotherapy of human tumours, because their genotoxic sensitivity may vary in different types of cancer cells. In this study we have compared DNA damage and the efficiency of its repair after genotoxic treatment with hydrogen peroxide, cisplatin and gamma-radiation of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC). Lymphocytes and tissue cells from biopsies of 37 cancer patients and 35 healthy donors as well as the HTB-43 larynx cancer cell line were employed. The cell sensitivity to genotoxic treatment was estimated by the MTT survival assay. The extent of DNA damage and efficiency of its repair was examined by the alkaline comet assay. Among the examined treatments, we found that HNSCC cells were the most sensitive to gamma-radiation and displayed impaired DNA repair. In particular, DNA damage was repaired less effectively in cells from HNSCC metastasis than healthy controls. In conclusion, our results suggest that the different genotoxic sensitivity of HNSCC cells may depend on their DNA repair capacity what in turn may be connected with the effectiveness of head and neck cancer therapy. © 2009 Verlag der Zeitschrift fur Naturforschung, Tubingen.",Included

2451,"Dopaminergic Modulation of Sensory Attenuation in Parkinson's Disease: Is There an Underlying Modulation of Beta Power? Background and Aims: Pathological high amplitude of beta oscillations is thought as the underlying mechanism of motor symptoms in Parkinson's disease (PD), in particular with regard to bradykinesia. In addition, abnormality in a neurophysiological phenomenon labeled sensory attenuation has been found in patients with PD. The current study explored the hypothesis that the abnormal sensory attenuation has a causal link with the typical abnormality in beta oscillations in PD. Method(s): The study tested sixteen right-handed patients with a diagnosis of PD and 22 healthy participants, which were matched by age and gender. Somatosensory evoked potentials were elicited through electrical stimulation of the median nerve at the wrist. Electrical activity was recorded at the scalp using a 128 channels EEG. Somatosensory evoked potentials were recorded in 2 conditions: at rest and at the onset of a voluntary movement, which was a self-paced abduction movement of the right thumb. Result(s): Healthy participants showed a reduction of the N20-P25 amplitude at the onset of the right thumb abduction compared to the rest condition (P < 0.05). When patients were OFF medication, they showed mild reduction of the N20-P25 component at movement onset (P < 0.05). On the contrary, they did show greater attenuation of the N20-P25 component at the onset of movement compared to the rest condition when ON medication (P < 0.05). There was no significant evidence of a link between the degree of sensory attenuation and the change in beta oscillations in our cohort of patients. Conclusion(s): These results confirmed a significant link between dopaminergic modulation and sensory attenuation. However, the sensory attenuation and beta oscillations were found as two independent phenomena.© Copyright © 2019 Macerollo, Limousin, Korlipara, Foltynie, Edwards and Kilner.",Excluded

Patients who died within 2 years of treatment with the primary site continuously disease-free were excluded from the local control analysis; all patients were included in the analysis of complications and survival. Irradiation resulted in control of the primary lesion in 1 of 2 patients who presented with T1 lesions, in 4 of the 12 patients with T2 lesions, and 3 of 17 patients who presented with T3 lesions. One patient with a T3 lesion that recurred locally was successfully salvaged by an operation. The 5-year absolute survival rates by stage were as follows: no patients with stage I lesions survived; of 11 stage II patients, one survived; and of 16 stage III patients, three survived. Interestingly, all four of the 5-year survivors were women.",Excluded

1425,"Comparisons of postoperative complications and nutritional status after proximal laparoscopic gastrectomy with esophagogastrostomy and double-tract reconstruction Background The purpose of this study was to compare postoperative complications and nutritional status between esophagogastrostomy and double-tract reconstruction in patients who underwent laparoscopic proximal gastrectomy, and assess the advantages of both surgical procedures. Methods Between 2010 and 2018, 47 cases underwent proximal gastrectomy with esophagogastrostomy (n = 23) or double-tract reconstruction (n = 24) at our institu-tion for the treatment of clinical T1N0 adenocarcinoma located in the upper third of the stomach. Patient clinical characteristics, short-term outcomes, nutrition status, and skeletal muscle index were compared among the two groups. Results There was no significant difference between esophagogastrostomy and double-tract reconstruction in terms of operation time, blood loss, and length of postoperative hospital stay. Reflux symptoms and anastomotic stenosis were significantly higher in the esophagogastrostomy group compared with the double-tract reconstruction group (P < 0.001 and P = 0.004, respectively). There was no significant difference in anastomotic leakage, surgical site infection, and pancre-atic fistula. For the nutritional status, the decrease rate of cholinesterase was significantly higher in the esopha-gogastrostomy group compared with the double-tract reconstruction group at 6 months (P = 0.008) There was no significant difference in the decrease rate of skeletal muscle mass index at 1 year after surgery. Conclusion Compared with esophagogastrostomy, double-tract reconstruction tends to have better short-term nutritional status and postoperative outcomes in terms of preventing the occurrence of gastroesophageal reflux and anastomosis stenosis. These findings suggest that double-tract reconstruction may be a useful method in laparoscopic proximal gastrectomy.Copyright © 2020 Tottori University Medical Press.",Excluded
1692,"Renal involvement in primary Sjogren's syndrome: a prospective cohort study The objective of the study is to prospectively evaluate the spectrum of clinical and subclinical renal involvement in patients with primary Sjogren's syndrome (pSS). Of the 174 patients screened, seventy patients with pSS underwent renal function tests, urine examination, renal ultrasound, arterial blood gases, urine pH followed by urine acidification test and renal biopsy (if indicated). Renal tubular acidosis (RTA) was treated with alkali replacement and moderate-severe tubulointerstitial nephritis (TIN) was treated with oral prednisolone. Sixty-two patients completed 1-year follow-up. A comparison was made between patients with and without renal involvement. Thirty-five (50%) patients had renal involvement. They had a lower baseline eGFR (71.85 +/- 18.04 vs. 83.8 +/- 17, p = 0.005). Twenty-nine patients had RTA (25 complete and 4 incomplete). Eleven patients had urinary abnormalities. Patients with RTA (n = 29) were younger (34.9 +/- 9 vs. 42 +/- 11.3, p = 0.006), had fewer articular (34% vs. 78%, p = 0.001) and ocular sicca (62% vs. 88%, P = 0.01) than those without RTA (n = 41) and commonly presented with hypokalemic paralysis. On biopsy, TIN (9/17) and IgA nephropathy (3/17) were most common. On follow-up, there was no clinically significant change in eGFR; however, one patient with renal calculi and incomplete distal renal tubular acidosis (dRTA) progressed to complete dRTA. Two patients treated with steroids had marginal improvement in eGFR. Renal involvement in pSS is under-recognized with the most common manifestation being RTA presenting with hypokalemic paralysis. These patients are younger with less articular and sicca symptoms. Subclinical RTA may progress to complete RTA. Renal biopsy should be considered in all patients with renal involvement.Copyright © 2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.",Excluded

1514,"Differential recovery of neural stem cells in the subventricular zone and dentate gyrus after ionizing radiation Radiation therapy is a widely used treatment for malignant central nervous system tumors. Mature neurons are terminally differentiated, whereas stem and progenitor cells have a prominent proliferative capacity and are therefore highly vulnerable to irradiation. Our aim was to investigate how cranial radiation in young rats would affect stem/progenitor cells in the two niches of adult neurogenesis, the subventricular zone (SVZ) and the dentate gyrus of the hippocampal formation. Nine weeks after irradiation we found that in irradiated animals, hippocampal neurogenesis was reduced to 5% of control levels. Similarly, the numbers of actively proliferating cells and radial glia-like stem cells (nestin+/glial fibrillary acidic protein [GFAP]+) in the dentate gyrus were reduced to 10% and 15% of control levels, respectively. In the irradiated olfactory bulb, neurogenesis was reduced to 40% of control levels, and the number of actively proliferating cells in the SVZ was reduced to 53% of control levels. However, the number of nestin+/GFAP+ cells in the SVZ was unchanged compared with controls. To evaluate the immediate response to the radiation injury, we quantified the amount of proliferation in the SVZ and dentate gyrus 1 day after irradiation. We found an equal reduction in proliferating cells both in dentate gyrus and SVZ. In summary, we show an initial response to radiation injury that is similar in both brain stem cell niches. However, the long-term effects on stem cells and neurogenesis in these two areas differ significantly: the dentate gyrus is severely affected long-term, whereas the SVZ appears to recover with time.",Included

Materials/Methods: From January 2006 to December 2010, a total of 1,208 patients with NPC treated with IMRT according to our institutional protocol were collected in the current study. The CTV-N was contoured according to DAHANCA, EORTC, GORTEC, NCIC, and RTOG consensus guidelines but the level I, the retrostyloid space, and the medial retropharyngeal nodes below the cranial edge of the second cervical vertebra (C2) were spared. Patients with locoregionally advanced disease were also prescribed cisplatin-based chemotherapy. Result(s): With a median follow-up of 57 months (range, 2-102 months), 33 patients had developed regional failure, of which, 22 patients encountered recurrence in the irradiation field and only 11 patients (1%) experienced relapse outside the irradiation field. The 5-year overall survival, distant metastasis-free survival, regional relapse-free survival, and local relapsefree survival were 80.8%, 82.6%, 96.8%, and 93.2% respectively. Multivariate analyses revealed that the N-classification was the only significant prognostic factor for predicting regional relapse-free survival.

363,"XRCC3 Thr241Met gene polymorphism and risk of colorectal cancer in Kashmir: a case control study XRCC (X-ray cross-complementing group) genes contribute to important DNA repair mechanisms that play roles in the repair of single strand breaks (SSBs) induced by a variety of external and internal factors, including ionizing radiation, alkylating agents and reactive oxygen species. These repair genes have a pivotal role in maintaining genomic stability through different pathways of base excision repair (BER). The aim of this study was to investigate the XRCC3 Thr241Met gene polymorphism in colorectal cancer (CRC) in Kashmir. We investigated the genotype distribution of XRCC3 gene in 120 CRC cases in comparison with 150 healthy subjects and found a significant association between XRCC3 genotypes and CRC (p<=0.05). Both heterozygous genotype (Thr/Met) as well as homozygous variant genotype (Met/Met) were moderately associated with elevated risk of CRC [OR=2.53; OR=2.29 respectively]. Also, Thr/Met and Met/Met genotypes demonstrated a significant association with the risk of CRC (p=0.003).

3384,"Swallowing functional outcomes and nutritional status in head and neck cancer radiotherapy: longitudinal study OBJECTIVE: To explore the relationships between swallowing functional outcomes and nutritional status in patients with head and neck cancer undergoing radiotherapy (RT). METHOD(S): This longitudinal study included 122 patients. Data were collected at three time points: baseline (T1), the third week of RT (T2) and the completion of RT (T3). The Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events was used to assess the symptom of dysphagia and other toxicities; the MD Anderson Dysphagia Inventory (MDADI) was used to assess the patient-perceived swallowing functional outcomes; the nutritional status was evaluated by the weight ratio and the Patient-Generated Subjective Global Assessment (PG-SGA). The generalised estimating equation (GEE) was used to measure the correlation of MDADI with the weight ratio or PG-SGA and also to analyse the influential factors of swallowing functional outcomes. RESULT(S): The participants' acute dysphagia rates were 5.7% at T1, 69.7% at T2 and 77.9% at T3. The swallowing functional outcomes worsen over RT (p<0.001) and were associated with weight ratio (beta=0.032, p=0.008) and PG-SGA (beta=-0.115, p<0.001). GEE models showed that patients with cancer of the pharynx region, advanced stage, chemoradiotherapy and high RT dose perceived worse swallowing functional outcomes. Oral mucositis, pharynx mucositis and salivary gland inflammation were positively correlated with swallowing functional outcomes, and the pharynx mucositis presented the highest absolute value of beta. CONCLUSION(S): The swallowing functional outcomes were negatively correlated with nutritional status. Healthcare professionals should identify early on the population at higher risk and focus on multiple toxicities, especially the management of pharynx mucositis, to improve nutritional status.Copyright © Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2020.

918,"Concomitant infusional paclitaxel and fluorouracil, oral hydroxyurea, and hyperfractionated radiation for locally advanced squamous head and neck cancer Purpose: To improve local disease control and survival with organ preservation, we conducted a phase II multi-institutional trial with a concomitant taxane-based chemotherapy and hyperfractionated radiation regimen. Patients and Methods: Sixty-four patients with locally advanced squamous cancers (stage IV, 98%; N2/3, 81%) were treated on an intensive regimen consisting of 5-day (120-hour) infusions of paclitaxel (20 mg/m2/d) and fluorouracil (600 mg/m2/d), oral hydroxyurea 500 mg every 12 hours for 11 doses, and radiation 1.5 Gy bid (T-FH2X). Chemoradiation was administered concomitantly on days 1 to 5 of each 14-day cycle. A full treatment course consisted of five cycles during a 10-week period to a total radiation dose of 72 to 75 Gy. Result(s): The median follow-up for the group is 34 months. At 3 years, progression-free survival is 63%, locoregional control is 86%, and systemic control is 79%; overall survival is 60%. Seventeen patients died of recurrent cancer, two died of second primary cancers, and four died of other causes. Side effects observed include anemia (22% required transfusion), leucopenia (34%, grade 3 to 4), and mucositis (84%, grade 3 to 4). Organ preservation principles were maintained. At 1 year posttreatment, 61% of patients had severe xerostomia and 47% had compromised swallowing. There was little disturbance of speech quality in 97% of patients at the same follow-up point. Conclusion(s): T-FH2X is a highly active and tolerable concomitant chemotherapy and hyperfractionated radiation regimen that induces sustained local tumor control and holds promise for improved survival with organ preservation in high-risk patients. Identification of less toxic therapy and improved distant disease control are needed. T-FH2X should be tested in a randomized trial and compared with a less intensive concomitant regimen that uses once-daily radiation fractionation. © 2001 by American Society of Clinical Oncology.",Excluded

1420,"Suppression of experimental corneal angiogenesis by focal X-ray irradiation PURPOSE: To investigate the effect of focal X-ray irradiation on experimental corneal angiogenesis in the rabbit., METHODS: A gelatin hydrogel sheet impregnated with basic fibroblast growth factor was implanted into the corneal stroma of rabbits; this induced corneal angiogenesis. After the first sign of corneal angiogenesis was noted, the corneal region was irradiated with a dose of 10 Gy or 20 Gy. The control rabbits received no irradiation. The eyes were examined by slitlamp biomicroscopy and photographed, over a period of 28 days. The maximum length and total surface area of corneal angiogenesis were quantified by computerized image analysis., RESULTS: Corneal angiogenesis was noted on day 3 following implantation of the hydrogel sheet. In the rabbits irradiated with 10 Gy, the maximum length and total surface area of corneal angiogenesis were both significantly lower on day 4 and 7 following irradiation, compared to the respective measurement in the controls. In the rabbits irradiated with 20 Gy, the maximum length and total surface area of corneal angiogenesis were significantly lower between days 4 and 21, and between days 4 and 14, respectively, compared to the respective measurement in the controls., CONCLUSIONS: Focal X-ray irradiation to the corneal region suppressed corneal angiogenesis in a dose-dependent manner.

294,"Radiation-induced apoptosis varies among individuals and is modified by sex and age Purpose: Although there are considerable data on mechanisms of radiation-induced apoptosis in vitro and in animal models, little is known about functional variation in these pathways in humans. We sought to develop a tractable system to evaluate this. Material(s) and Method(s): Peripheral blood mononuclear cells were isolated from 90 healthy volunteers, divided into two aliquots, one irradiated with a 5 Gy dose and the other sham-treated (0 Gy), and assessed for damage-induced apoptosis after 24 hours. To investigate reproducibility, 10 individuals spanning the entire radiation-induced apoptotic range were tested three times each, with 3-6 months between replicates. Result(s): We observed surprising heterogeneity in apoptosis among individuals, ranging from 21-62%. Biological replicates from a single individual, however, were completely concordant, suggesting the variability observed across individuals is not the result of stochastic or short-term effects. We found significantly higher radiation-induced apoptosis in males than in females (Mean: 41.0% vs. 30.7%; p < 3.5 x 10<sup>-7</sup>). Moreover, advancing age was associated with decreasing radiation-induced apoptosis in males (p = 0.01) but not females (p = 0.82). Conclusion(s): Our results provide evidence that the function of cellular pathways crucial for stress-induced apoptosis varies by sex and could decline with age in humans.

We present our experience in the treatment on robotic system <>, UK. Material(s) and Method(s): Since 2010 this method therapy is applied for treating patients with brain tumors in Khabarovsk Clinical Oncology Centre. During the period of May 2010 - December 2012, 43 patients were treated using SRT. 30 patients with meningioma; 4 - with recurrent astrocytoma; 3 - with metastasis; 3 - with hemispheric cavernous malformation; 2 case of intracanalicular vestibular schwannoma; 1 patient with adenoma. Patients' age from 23 to 71 years old (mean, 52 Y). 10 men and 33 women. Formation of conformal dose distribution was obtained by multileaf (40-pair) collimator with a 0.25 mm accuracy of positioning. Frame fixation was standard. Dose distribution was calculated via XiO system. Patient positioning inaccuracy was measured by X-ray Volume Imaging (XVIm). The correction of patient's position was preformed automatically with HexaPod system, resulting in 0.1 mm accuracy by linear coordinates and 0.1degree by angular coordinates. Result(s): In the 6-months of postradiation period the stabilization of tumor and regression of symptoms was found in all patients. At the 12 months follow-up period tumor shrinking was found in 3 patients, in other cases the stabilization of tumor was observed. There were no severe adverse events. Conclusion(s): Our moderate experience of SRT of patients with brain tumors shows an effectiveness of the method. Moreover, in cases of tumor localization in eloquent areas and in patients with high operative risk, SRT implementation presents as the only accessible type of treatment.

Previously, we have shown the efficacy of individualized dose escalation based on normal tissue constraints in sequential chemo-radiation (van Baardwijk et al, J Clin Oncol 2010). Here, we report the mature results of a Phase II trial (NCT00572325) on individualized radiation dose-escalation in concurrent chemo-radiation. Materials/Methods: Stage III NSCLC patients fit for concurrent chemo-radiation (PS 0-2; FEV1 and DLCO >30%) were included. An individualized prescribed total tumor dose (TTD) based on normal tissue dose constraints was applied: mean lung dose (MLD) 19 Gy, spinal cord dose 54 Gy and brachial plexus dose 66 Gy. RT planning was 4D-PET-CT based. ATTD between 51 and 69 Gy was delivered in 1.5 Gy fractions twice daily up to 45 Gy, followed by once daily fractions of 2 Gy. Radiotherapy (RT) was started at the second course of chemotherapy. OS and Progression Free Survival (PFS) were calculated from date of diagnosis (Kaplan-Meier). Toxicity was scored according to CTCAE v 3.0. Result(s): One hundred fifty patients (97 men and 53 women, median age 63.2 years) were included from April 2006 until December 2009. Stage: IIB 0.7%, IIIA 34.7%, IIIB 64.6%, including 7 patients (9.7%) with recurrent disease. Median total GTV (+/- SD, range): 73.9 +/- 91.3 cc (3.7-518.9 cc). Median TTD was 65.0 +/- 5.9 Gy (51-69.0 Gy) given in an OTTof 35 days (equals a scheme of 74 Gy in 37 fractions QD in 7.4 weeks). The median MLD was 16.3 +/- 3.7 Gy (4.4-21.0 Gy). Six patients (4.0%) did not complete radiotherapy (3 due to toxicity, 3 patient's wish). Severe acute toxicity (>=Grade 3, n = 51, 34.0%) consisted mainly of Grade 3 dysphagia during RT (24.0%) and 1 month after RT (6.0%). Pulmonary complaints were less frequent: Grade 3 and 4 dyspnea resp. 2.7% and 0.7% and 8.7% Grade 3 cough.With regard to late toxicity: 4% Grade 3 dysphagia (e.g., stenosis/ulcus), 2% thoracic empyema or fistula and 1 patient died of a radiation pneumonitis (0.7%). Five patients (3.3%) died within 3 months after start of RT (pulmonary causes n = 2; sepsis n = 1; cardiomyopathy n = 1; unknown cause n = 1).With a median FU of 29.4 months (95% CI 26.1-32.6 months), the median OS was 24.2 months (95% CI 18.9-29.6 months; 2year OS 51.5%) and the median PFS 16.5 months (95% CI 11.9-21.1 months). Eighty-six patients (57.6%) showed recurrent disease: 13.4% local and/or regional recurrence, 26.7% distant metastasis and 17.3% a combination of both as first event.

Different cage designs may cause different extent of X-ray exposure to visualize the cage positon intraoperatively. In this study, we retrospectively evaluated the X-ray exposure and clinical outcomes of the direction-changeable cage in transforaminal lumbar interbody fusion (TLIF). The patients were divided into the direction-changeable cage group (group A, n=79) and non-direction-changeable cage group (group B, n=84). Intraoperative implantation duration, cage position adjustment times, implantation fluoroscopy times, fluoroscopy exposure time of cage implantation, Oswestry Disability Index (ODI) and visual analogue scale (VAS) scores were recorded before and after operation at the last follow-up. CT scanning was performed to evaluate lumbar fusion. All the patients underwent single-level TLIF and were followed up for 12 to 18 months. In the group A, intraoperative implantation duration, cage position adjustment times, implantation fluoroscopy times, and fluoroscopy exposure time of cage implantation were 6.7 +/- 3.6 min, 1.2 +/- 0.4 times, 2.5 +/- 0.6 times, 7.84 +/- 1.83 s, retrospectively. In the group B, these parameters were 11.5 +/- 5.9 min, 2.6 +/- 1.3 times, 5.8 +/- 1.7 times, and 15.31 +/- 5.16 s retrospectively, which were higher than those in the non-direction-changeable cage group with statistical significance (P<0.05). In terms of ODI and VAS scores, there was no statistical difference between the two groups before or after operation at the last follow-up (P>0.05). Regarding to the complications, there were 4 cases (4.49%) in the group A, with 3 cases of non-union and 1 case of dural laceration. Eight cases (10.53%) showed complications in the group B, with 7 cases of non-union and 1 case of infection. There was a significant difference between the groups in terms of the complication rate (P<0.05). In conclusion, the direction-changeable cage has merits like lower radiation exposure and fewer complications compared to the non-direction-changeable cage in treating isthmic lumbar spondylolisthesis. Both cages could yield equal clinical outcomes.Copyright © 2019, E-Century Publishing Corporation. All rights reserved.",Excluded

Images were assessed by two experienced urogenital radiologists in consensus for image quality, diagnostic certainty of stone detection, obstruction, parenchymal lesions and morphological distinctive features. Imaging diagnoses of MDCT and IVP were compared with the final clinical diagnoses. In case of failure to detect an relevant pathology, the final clinical diagnosis was established after a mean follow-up period of 18 +/- 6 months (10 months to 2 years). Costs and radiation exposure of IVP and MDCT were compared., RESULTS: MDCT scan performed better than IVP in terms of image quality for all regarded variables. Image quality of MDCT was rated in all parameters as very good or good; the image quality of IVP differed in a wide range. MDCT and IVP reached a sensitivity of 100 % and 50 % for stone detection (n = 14, p = 0.008), respectively. Two bladder stones were not detected by IVU but correctly seen with MDCT. MDCT and IVP were unsatisfactory for detecting transitional cell carcinomas (n = 4, 2 of 4 detected with MDCT, 0 of 4 detected with IVU). One false positive transitional cell carcinoma was detected with IVP, none with MDCT. Additional relevant pathological changes (one teratoma, one abdominal aortic aneurysma and one abscess) were detected using MDCT but missed with IVP. In 38 of 59 patients (64 %) imaging and clinical follow-up over up to 24 months did not reveal any pathology to explain the microhematuria. The costs of the IVP (283 Euro) were lower compared with non-enhanced MDCT (380 Euro) or combined non-enhanced and contrast-enhanced MDCT (560 Euro). The radiation exposure was 23 - 27 mSv for MDCT and 2.3 mSv for IVP., CONCLUSION: MDCT performed better regarding image quality, subjective diagnostic certainty and diagnostic results with respect to stone detection. Since urolithiasis is a frequent cause of painless microhematuria MDCT is recommended as the initial imaging modality rather than IVU.",Excluded
3456,"Management of oropharyngeal cancer: a cross-sectional review of institutional practice at a large Canadian referral centre BACKGROUND: Over the years, the treatment of oropharyngeal cancer has changed; in the past, first-line treatment consisted of surgery followed by adjuvant radiotherapy, today however, primary treatment typically involves concomitant chemoradiation, and reserves surgery for salvage. While chemoradiation is the modality of choice for primary management of oropharyngeal cancer, disease characteristics, institutional bias, and patient preferences influence treatment choice. This has lead to variation in the treatment of OPC, and has generated some uncertainly regarding the ideal therapeutic approach. The objective of this study was to describe the treatment of OPC a large Canadian referral center, highlighting trends in treatment choice and outcome., METHODS: This is a cross-sectional retrospective review of clinical practice at Sunnybrook Health Science Centre (Toronto, ON). This investigation documents type of first-line treatment, rates of treatment failure, rates of surgical salvage, and 5-year disease-free survival. This study also asses the therapeutic impact of free-flap reconstruction on the use of a postoperative tracheostomy and/or percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy tube., RESULTS: The majority of oropharyngeal cancer patients presented with regionally metastatic disease (stage III-IV) and underwent concomitant chemoradiation as first-line treatment. Just over half of patients who failed chemoradiation were eligible for salvage surgery. Forty-six percent of salvage patients recurred at approximately 6 months, and died approximately 12 months following the first sign of disease recurrence. Five-year survival for salvage patients stage II, III, IVA, and IVB was 100%, 54.5%, 53.8%, and 50%, respectively. The incidence of percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy tubes and tracheostomies was comparable between patients who underwent free-flap reconstruction and patients who did not., CONCLUSION: The modality of choice for first-line treatment of oropharyngeal cancer is concomitant chemoradiation. The moderate failure rate following chemoradiation and the modest survival rate following salvage surgery could indicate that selected patients may benefit from undergoing surgery as first-line treatment.

978,"Management of mandibular osteoradionecrosis corresponding to the severity of osteoradionecrosis and the method of radiotherapy PURPOSE: : To demonstrate appropriate treatment methods for mandibular osteoradionecrosis (ORN) by evaluating previous results., METHODS: : The relationship between the time interval after radiation therapy (RT) and the severity of ORN was examined. Eighty-seven patients were classified according to the extent of the lesion (grades), and the cure rates were calculated according to the RT modality, the grade, and the treatment method for ORN., RESULTS: : The later ORN developed and the higher the dose of irradiation, particularly among the patients who received external RT, the more it progressed. The initial cure rates for conservative management, marginal, and segmental mandibulectomy were 39.7%, 50%, and 86.7%, respectively., CONCLUSIONS: : Conservative management should be limited to early-onset ORN after brachytherapy with or without a low dose of external irradiation. Marginal mandibulectomy is appropriate for the late-onset ORN after brachytherapy with or without low-dose external irradiation. Segmental mandibulectomy is required for late-onset ORN after a high dose of external irradiation. Copyright 2003 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. Head Neck 25: 181-186, 2003",Excluded
3408,"Predicting late effects of pelvic radiotherapy: is there a better approach? PURPOSE: Significant chronic symptoms following pelvic radiotherapy occur more frequently than commonly realized. Predictive factors for the development of late symptoms are poorly defined. Moderate sustained acute (cumulative) toxicity might predict severe late effects better than peak reaction., METHODS AND MATERIALS: To determine prospectively whether peak or cumulative gastrointestinal (GI) acute symptoms better predict late symptoms in patients receiving pelvic radiotherapy. Symptom scores were measured weekly from the start of radiotherapy, and at 1 year using the Modified Inflammatory Bowel Disease Questionnaire-Bowel subset. The possible prognostic impact of patient-related factors was explored., RESULTS: Three hundred and eight patients were recruited. 100 were excluded due to lack of follow-up data at one year resulting from death, too ill, stoma, relapsed, non-response or withdrawal. A further 15 were excluded for incomplete data, leaving 193 patients with evaluable data. Of these, 28 had GI, 101 urological, and 64 gynecological cancers. Patients' median age was 65 years (range, 23-82), and they were treated with median 60 Gy dose for a median of 6 weeks. Univariate analysis revealed a significant association between cumulative acute symptom scores and scores at 1 year (p < 0.001), which was dose-independent (p < 0.001). Acute peak and 1-year scores were not associated (p = 0.431). The correlation coefficient between cumulative acute symptoms and symptoms at 1 year was 0.367 and for peak acute symptoms was weaker at 0.057. Patients with an abnormal body mass index and current smokers were more likely to experience worse symptoms at 1 year., CONCLUSION: Cumulative acute symptoms are more predictive of late symptoms than peak acute changes in score. This association is independent of the radiotherapy dose delivered and is suggestive of a consequential late effect. Copyright © 2010 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.",Excluded
1536,"Effect of the radioprotective drugs MEA, DMSO, and WR-2721 on tumor control and skin tolerance in the rat Mercaptoethylamine (MEA), dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO), and S-2-(3-aminopropylamino)ethylphosphorothioate (WR-2721) were tested for their protective effects against single and fractionated doses of 250 kv X-rays. Acute and late skin reactions and control of the BA-1112 rhabdomyosarcoma were examined in protected and unprotected WAG/Rij rats. All drugs protected skin in both single and fractionated treatment regimens, with MEA giving the most protection and DMSO the least. DMSO and WR-2721 protected tumors against single doses of radiation, and all three drugs tested protected tumors against fractionated irradiation. As a result, only single-fraction treatments of MEA-protected animals showed therapeutically favorable differential protection.",Excluded

A subset was imaged prospectively using a high-resolution Fourier-domain optical coherence tomography., RESULTS: Among 94 eyes treated, 33 eyes (32 subjects) had >= 2-year follow-up information (mean follow-up, 6.2 years; range, 2-10 years). Final visual acuity ranged from 20/50 to no light perception. Final macular findings included central geographic atrophy (49%), disciform scar (30%), and active choroidal neovascular membrane (9%). Fourier-domain optical coherence tomography images of three eyes with geographic atrophy revealed photoreceptor layer loss within areas of geographic atrophy with intact retinal morphology in areas of radiation exposure outside geographic atrophy. Radiation retinopathy was suspected in 18% and confirmed by fluorescein angiography in 15%, ranging from mild to neovascular glaucoma/phthisis bulbi (2 eyes). Mean time from stereotactic fractionated external beam radiation to development of radiation retinopathy was 5.4 years (range, 1-10 years)., CONCLUSION: A moderate rate of delayed radiation retinopathy was noted in eyes with neovascular age-related macular degeneration treated with stereotactic fractionated external beam radiation.

1030,"Cancer incidence among Australian nuclear industry workers To assess whether workers at Lucas Heights Science and Technology Centre (LHSTC) had different levels of cancer incidence from the New South Wales (NSW) population in Australia. A retrospective cohort study was undertaken at LHSTC. Data on 7,076 workers employed between 1957-98 were abstracted from personnel, dosimetry, and medical files. An inception cohort was defined which included 4,523 workers in employment between 1972-96 to examine cancer incidence. Cancer registrations in the inception cohort were identified to 1996 through electronic linkage of records with the NSW and the Australian national registers of cancer incidence. All-cancer incidence in workers at LHSTC was 15% below the NSW rates [SIR=0.85; 95% CI=(0.75, 0.95)]. Of 37 specific cancers and groups of cancers examined, statistically significant excesses relative to NSW rates were observed only for pleural cancer incidence [SIR=17.71; 95%=(7.96, 39.43)], and for incidence of cancer of the small intestine [SIR=4.34; 95% CI=(1.40, 13.46)]. This study gives little evidence of an increased risk of cancers associated with radiation exposure in a cohort of nuclear workers in Australia. The observed increase in the risk of cancer of the pleura was probably due to unmeasured exposures, given the lack of an established association with radiation exposure, and the strong link to asbestos exposure. Findings for cancers of the small intestine were based on small numbers and were likely to be due to chance.",Included
1041,"Effect of gamma radiation on the biology of the flesh fly, Parasarcophaga argyrostoma. I. Following larval exposure One and seven days old larvae of the flesh fly, Parasarcophaga argyrostoma were exposed to doses ranging from 1-90 Gy. Lower doses ranging from 1-9 Gy applied to young larvae accelerate larval development whereas old larvae responded to doses from 10-90 Gy by a remarkable retardation of the larval and pupal development. Reduction in percentage pupation and adult emergence were noticed with increment in the radiation doses applied. This reduction was higher for irradiated seven days old larvae than the one day old larvae at all doses applied, indicating that young larvae were more susceptible to gamma radiation than the older one. At higher doses (30-70 Gy) the pupae could not continue their development and died within 17 days after pupation. The longevity of adults resulted from irradiated larvae was decreased by increasing the radiation dosage and it was found that adults emerging from irradiated young larvae lived shorter than those from irradiated young ones, the fecundity of adults resulted from irradiated larvae was also decreased by gamma irradiation exposures. The percentage reduction of larviposition was 100% for irradiated females with 8 Gy while that of irradiated males was 97.5% indicating that females were more sensitive to radiation than males.",Excluded
2871,"Ocular surface squamous neoplasia (Squamous Cell Carcinoma) of the socket: Management of extensive tumors with interferon PURPOSE:: To describe the clinical features and management of extensive ocular surface squamous neoplasia (OSSN) (squamous cell carcinoma) of the socket. METHOD(S):: Retrospective interventional case series. Interferon alpha 2b (IFNa2b) eye drops (1 million units/cc) 4 times daily and IFNa2b sublesional injection (5 million units/0.5cc to 8 million units/0.8 cc) were delivered for tumor control. Participants were 3 patients with ocular prosthesis who developed extensive socket OSSN. Tumor control was graded as complete regression, partial regression, or no regression. RESULT(S):: OSSN was detected in the socket at age 60, 43, and 20 years in patients who had worn ophthalmic prostheses for 54, 26, and 13 years, respectively. The patients had chronic discharge and irritation (n = 3) managed with intermittent topical corticosteroids (n = 2). There were no predisposing factors of cigarette exposure, radiation exposure, eczema, systemic immune suppression, or organ transplantation. The prosthesis fit well with nonirritative edges. At presentation, OSSN was subtle (n = 3), vascular (n = 3), and multifocal (n = 3), with largest lesions or confluence of lesions measuring 20, 25, and 20 mm, respectively. The tumors involved the tarsal (n = 3), bulbar (n = 2), and forniceal (n = 2) surfaces. All patients were treated with topical and injection IFNa2b, with complete regression achieved in 2 cases (at 1 months and 20 months) and partial regression in one case (at 9 months). All patients continue on chronic maintenance IFNa2b topically. There were no recurrences, and IFNa2b injection side effects of nausea and chills were minor, lasting 1 day. No patient required surgical removal of tumors from the socket and no patient required exenteration. CONCLUSION(S):: Patients wearing ophthalmic prosthesis over a socket should be monitored for the development of OSSN. Combined topical and injection IFNa2b could represent a potentially effective therapy for this condition. © 2011 The American Society of Ophthalmic Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery, Inc.",Excluded
2793,"Radiation dose among different cardiac and vascular invasive procedures: The RODEO study Background Interventional radiology and cardiology procedures contribute significantly to the collective dose of radiation exposure from medical interventions. Recent and dedicated studies comparing directly these procedures in term of patient radiation exposure are lacking. Our aim was to compare radiation exposure among different interventional procedures performed under fluoroscopic guidance. Methods The RODEO study (NCT: 02972736) is an international observational retrospective multicenter study enrolling all patients undergoing diagnostic or interventional procedures performed by different interventional operators (i.e. radiologists, interventional cardiologists or electrophysiologists) in 6 centers, without exclusion criteria. The primary end-point of the study was the comparison of dose area product (DAP) among interventional cardiology, electrophysiology or interventional radiology procedures. Results A total of 17,711 procedures were included in the study: 13,522 interventional cardiology, 2352 electrophysiology and 1864 interventional radiology procedures. The highest DAP values were observed for interventional radiology procedures (74 Gy * cm2 [Interquartile range 27-178 Gy * cm2]), followed by interventional cardiology (40 Gy * cm2 [22-78 Gy * cm2]) and electrophysiology procedures (13 Gy * cm2 [4-44 Gy * cm2], p < 0.0001). In term of specific procedures, the highest DAP values were observed in structural or valvular cardiac procedures (134 Gy * cm2 [51-260 Gy * cm2]) whereas the lowest DAP values in pacemaker insertion (11 Gy * cm2 [4-28 Gy * cm2]). Conclusion In this large multicenter study, the highest radiation exposure was observed in procedures performed by interventional radiologists. However, among specific procedures, structural or valvular cardiac procedures were associated with the highest radiation exposure.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",Excluded
2250,"Management of mediastinal relapse after treatment with stereotactic body radiotherapy or accelerated hypofractionated radiotherapy for stage I/II non-small-cell lung cancer Purpose/Objective(s): Regional failures occur in up to 15% of patients treated with stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) for stage I/II lung cancer. This report focuses on the management of the unique scenario of isolated regional failures. Method(s): Patients treated initially with SBRT or accelerated hypofractionated radiotherapy were screened for curative intent treatment of isolated mediastinal failures (IMFs). Local control, regional control, progression-free survival, and distant control were estimated from the date of salvage treatment using the Kaplan-Meier method. Result(s): Among 160 patients treated from 2002 to 2012, 12 suffered IMF and were amenable to salvage treatment. The median interval between treatments was 16 months (2-57 mo). Median salvage dose was 66 Gy (60-70 Gy). With a median follow-up of 10 months, the median overall survival was 15 months (95% confidence interval, 5.8-37 mo). When estimated from original treatment, the median overall survival was 38 months (95% confidence interval, 17-71 mo). No subsequent regional failures occurred. Distant failure was the predominant mode of relapse following salvage for IMF with a 2-year distant control rate of 38%. At the time of this analysis, three patients have died without recurrence while four are alive and no evidence of disease. High-grade toxicity was uncommon. Conclusion(s): To our knowledge, this is first analysis of salvage mediastinal radiation after SBRT or accelerated hypofractionated radiotherapy in lung cancer. Outcomes appear similar to stage III disease at presentation. Distant failures were common, suggesting a role for concurrent or sequential chemotherapy. A standard full course of external beam radiotherapy is advisable in this unique clinical scenario.© Copyright 2015 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc. All rights reserved.",Excluded
650,"Gender difference in the development of ischemic heart disease in emergency workers of the Chernobyl accident Objectives: Since women accounted for only 8.7% of the total number of Chernobyl emergency workers (EW), the radiation effect on cardiovascular system was previously studied mainly in men. So the goal of current investigation was to determine the development of ischemic heart disease (IHD) in men and women exposed to ionizing radiation. Method(s): The study included 598 EW of 1986 year (472 men and 126 women) who had no signs of cardiac pathology during they took part in elimination of consequences caused by the Chernobyl accident. For that time women's age was 41+/-6.9 years, but men 37.8+/-8.5 years (p=0.011). The female group was also significantly older than the male at the time of the examination (69.1+/-7.2 versus 63.7+/-10.4, p=0). Patients of both groups in 2012-2016 after admission in our hospital had cardiologist examination, electrocardiography, daily monitoring of electrocardiogram, echocardiography. Result(s): At the time of examination IHD in women was more often combined with arterial hypertension (94.4% compared to 87.7% in men, p=0.001), diabetes mellitus (27.0% vs. 23.9% in men, p=0.828), alimentary obesity (57.1% vs. 39.2%, p=0) and hypercholesterolemia (66.7% versus 60.4%, p=0.239). In both groups, the portion of patients with stroke was practically equal (9.5% and 9.7%) as well as with blockade (2.4% and 2.3%), atrial fibrillation (16.7% and 16.5%), and ventricular extrasystoles (7.9% and 7%). Men were more likely to have supraventricular arrhythmias (13.3% and 1.6%, p=0.042) and higher number of smokers (40.9% and 1.6%, p=0). It was shown that 25% of all male EW developed IHD in 11.7+/-0.5 years after irradiation, while the same number of EW-women after 15.5+/-1.3 years. Exactly half of male group had the diagnosis of IHD after 18.7+/-0.8 years while women after 21.6+/-0.7 years. After 24.7+/-0.4 and 26.8+/-0.5 years, IHD developed in 75% of men and women, respectively. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis showed high reliability of differences in the development of IHD in two examined groups (logrank test: chi<sup>2</sup> = 10.001, p=0,001). The median survival rate fell on the age of 57+/-0.6 years for men and 61.4+/-0.9 years of women. Conclusion(s): The gender specific features of IHD development in EW consisted in its earlier term of onset after irradiation in men than in women. Men developed IHD at younger age than women despite the presence of a greater number of people with risk factors such as hypertension, diabetes mellitus, hypercholesterolemia and obesity.",Included
3537,"UV irradiation-induced DNA hypomethylation around WNT1 gene: Implications for solar lentigines Wnt/beta-catenin signalling promotes melanogenesis in melanocytes and also induces melanocytogenesis from melanocyte stem cells (McSCs). Previous study reported that WNT1, a ligand which activates Wnt/beta-catenin signalling pathway, was more highly expressed in the epidermis at SLs than in normal skin areas, suggesting that WNT1 causes hyperpigmentation. To elucidate the mechanism by which WNT1 expression is increased in SLs, we examined the methylation of 5-carbon of cytosine (5mC), that is 5-methylcytosine (5mC) level, in a region within the WNT1 promoter; the methylation of the region was known to negatively regulate WNT1 gene expression. We used an immortalized cell line of human interfollicular epidermal stem cells to analyse the effect of UVB irradiation on DNA methylation level of WNT1 promoter and found that UVB irradiation caused demethylation of WNT1 promoter and promoted WNT1 mRNA expression. It was also found that UVB irradiation reduced the expression of DNA methyltransferase 1 (DNMT1), an enzyme responsible for maintaining methylation patterns during cell division. Pathological analysis of SLs and non-SL regions in the human skin revealed that both DNMT1 expression and 5mC level were decreased at SLs compared to non-SL skins. Furthermore, bisulphite sequencing showed that the methylated CpG level in WNT1 promoter was also lower at SLs than in non-SL skins. Thus, in the skin exposed to a high amount of UV rays, excessive expression of WNT1 is thought to be caused by the demethylation of WNT1 promoter, and the upregulated WNT1 promotes melanocytogenesis and melanogenesis, then resulting in SL formation.

Expression of Epstein-Barr virus gene products will affect the radiosensitivity of the cancer cells. Here, the association between EBV BamH1-A rightward transcript 7 microRNA (ebv-miR-BART7) and the effects on irradiation sensitivity was explored. Methods Tissue ebv-miR-BART7 expression level was quantified using real-time quantitative PCR. The radiosensitivity of nasopharyngeal carcinoma cells with ebv-miR-BART7 expression was evaluated by colony formation assay, cell proliferation assay, apoptosis assay, H2AX phosphorylation staining and acridine orange staining. In addition, xenograft model was developed using zebrafish embryo to validate the in vivo radiation sensitivity of the ebv-miR-BART7-expressing NPC. Results Primary NPC tissues and recurrent NPC tissues had a significant higher ebv-miR-BART7 level in comparison with the corresponding normal counterparts. ebv-miR-BART7-expressing NPC cells had higher sensitivity to irradiation treatment. Conclusion Our results suggested that NPC patients have an elevated ebv-miR-BART expression in the primary NPC and recurrent NPC tissue. High ebv-miR-BART increases the sensitivity of NPC cells to irradiation treatment. Further investigation on the clinical value of ebv-miR-BART7 to the therapeutic response is warranted to evaluate the potential use of ebv-miR-BART7 as molecular biomarker in monitoring NPC patients.",Included
816,"Impact of age on the selection of nuclear cardiology stress protocols: The INCAPS (IAEA nuclear cardiology protocols) study BACKGROUND: There is growing concern about radiation exposure from nuclear myocardial perfusion imaging (MPI), particularly among younger patients who are more prone to develop untoward effects of ionizing radiation, and hence US and European professional society guidelines recommend age as a consideration in weighing radiation risk from MPI. We aimed to determine how patient radiation doses from MPI vary across age groups in a large contemporary international cohort. METHODS: Data were collected as part of a global cross-sectional study of centers performing MPI coordinated by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). Sites provided information on each MPI study completed during a single week in March-April 2013. We compared across age groups laboratory adherence to pre-specified radiation-related best practices, radiation effective dose (ED; a whole-body measure reflecting the amount of radiation to each organ and its relative sensitivity to radiation's deleterious effects), and the proportion of patients with ED<=9mSv, a target level specified in guidelines. RESULTS: Among 7911 patients undergoing MPI in 308 laboratories in 65 countries, mean ED was 10.0+/-4.5mSv with slightly higher exposure among younger age groups (trend p value<0.001). There was no difference in the proportion of patients with ED<=9mSv across age groups, or in adherence to best practices based on the median age of patients in a laboratory. CONCLUSIONS: In contemporary nuclear cardiology practice, the age of the patient appears not to impact protocol selection and radiation dose, contrary to professional society guidelines.",Excluded

Topics included perceptions of PPI adverse effects (AEs) and effectiveness for upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB) prevention, changes in prescribing, and management recommendations for patients using PPIs for gastroesophageal reflux disease or UGIB prevention. We used logistic regression to identify factors associated with appropriate PPI continuation in the scenario of a patient at high risk for UGIB., RESULTS: Among 437 respondents (55% response rate), 10% were trainees and 72% specialized in general medicine, 70% were somewhat/very concerned about PPI AEs, and 76% had somewhat/very much changed their prescribing. A majority believed PPIs increase the risk for 6 of 12 AEs queried. Fifty-two percent perceived PPIs to be somewhat/very effective for UGIB prevention. In a gastroesophageal reflux disease scenario in which PPI can be safely discontinued, 86% appropriately recommended PPI discontinuation. However, in a high-risk UGIB prevention scenario in which long-term PPI use is recommended, 79% inappropriately recommended discontinuation. In this latter scenario, perceived effectiveness for bleeding prevention was strongly associated with continuing PPI (odds ratio 7.68, P < 0.001 for moderately; odds ratio 17.3, P < 0.001 for very effective). Other covariates, including concern about PPI AEs, had no significant association., DISCUSSION: Most internists believe PPIs cause multiple AEs and recommend discontinuation even in patients at high risk for UGIB. Future interventions should focus on ensuring that PPIs are prescribed appropriately according to individual risks and benefits.",Excluded

2252,"Differential radio-adaptive responses in BALB/c and C57BL/6 mice: pivotal role of calcium and nitric oxide signalling Purpose: Our earlier studies demonstrated that transient radio-adaptive responses (RAR) in BALB/c mice were due to MAPK hyperactivation. The objective of this study was to determine the time duration of this low dose induced MAPK activation in BALB/c mice and to find out if similar adaptive responses are observed in C57BL/6 mice. Materials and methods: Mice were irradiated with 0.1 Gy priming dose (PD), 2 Gy challenge dose (CD) with an interval of 4 h (P + CD) and radiation induced immunosuppression in splenic lymphocytes was monitored as the endpoint for RAR. Results: Time kinetics following 0.1 Gy demonstrated persistence of MAPK hyperactivation till 48 h. Similar experiments in C57BL/6 mice indicated absence of RAR at 24 h following CD, in spite of MAPK activation which was also confirmed by time kinetics. Therefore, upstream activators of MAPK, viz., reactive oxygen and nitrogen species (ROS, RNS) and calcium levels were estimated. There was increased intracellular calcium (Ca2+) and nitric oxide (NO) in BALB/c and an increase in intracellular ROS in C57BL/6 mice 24 h after PD. Inhibition of NO and calcium chelation abrogated RAR in BALB/c mice. In vitro treatment of spleen cells with combination of NO donor and Ca2+ ionophore mimicked the effect of PD and induced adaptive response after 2 Gy not only in BALB/c but also in C57BL/6 mice confirming their crucial role in RAR. Conclusions: These results suggest that low dose induced differential induction of Ca2+ and NO signaling along with MAPK was responsible for contrasting RAR with respect to immune system of BALB/c and C57BL/6 mice.

1338,"Magnetic resonance spectroscopic study of radiogenic changes after radiosurgery of cerebral arteriovenous malformations with implications for the differential diagnosis of radionecrosis Background: The incidence of radionecrosis after radiosurgery is 5-20%. That radionecrosis after radiosurgery may be confused with a malignant tumor is a known phenomenon and problem. Method(s): Three similarly treated patients with cAVM, 1 patient with symptomatic radionecrosis and 2 patients with normal post-radiation MRI changes, were selected and studied in detail with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), magnetic resonance angiography (MRA), and magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS). 2 cAVM were located in eloquent locations and were classified as Spetzler-Martin grade (SM) III such that interdisciplinary radiosurgery was recommended; a third patient with a left frontal SM II cAVM refused surgery. 1 patient was male, and 2 were female. The patient's ages ranged from 38 to 62 years (median, 39 years). The nidus volume (= planning target volume = PTV) ranged from 2.75 to 6.89 ccm (median, 6.41 ccm). The single dose was 20 Gy at the isocenter of the PTV encompassing the 80 - 90% isodose. The median follow-up period was 20 months (range, 16 - 84 months). Toxicities were evaluated with the Common Terminology Criteria (CTC) for adverse events version 3.0. Result(s): No patient suffered a bleeding from cAVM during the study period. A complete nidus occlusion was shown in all patients with time-resolved MRA. All patients showed radiogenic MRI changes, 1 patient showed excessive radionecrosis. This patient was oligosymptomatic and under temporary corticoid therapy symptoms resolved completely.Following patterns associated with radionecrosis in the MRS studies were identified in our collective:. * 2D spectroscopic imaging (2D-SI) revealed much lower concentrations of metabolites in the lesion as compared to contralateral healthy tissue in all patients.* Whereas regions with regular post-radiosurgery effects showed almost normal levels of Cho and a Cho/Cr ratio < 2.0, regions with radionecrosis were characterized by increased lipid levels and a Cho/Cr ratio > 2.0 in conjunction with decreased absolute levels of all metabolites, especially of Cr and NAA. Conclusion(s): MRS is an increasingly valuable tool for the differential diagnosis of radiation reactions. Specific patterns of MRS spectra in radionecrosis were identified; in synopsis with clinical parameters, these changes have to be taken into account to avoid misdiagnosis. © 2013 Bostrom et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",Excluded

Material(s) and Method(s): A retrospective chart review of vitreous biopsy proven patients was performed. The data analysis included demographics, systemic lymphoma status, ocular symptoms, clinical and immunocytological findings, treatment methods, and response (intravitreal methotrexate 300 mug/0.05 mL, 1000 mug/0.1 mL of rituximab and EBRT 36-45 Gy) and ocular and systemic lymphoma outcomes at last follow-up. Result(s): Twelve eyes of 8 patients had intraocular B-cell lymphoma (median age, 61 years; range, 50-83). Central nervous system non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (CNS-NHL) was present in 7 of 8 patients. Most common ocular symptoms were diminution of vision in 4 and floaters in 3 patients. Iritis and uveitis were fournd in 6 eyes and vitritis in 11 eyes. Retinal infiltrates were present in 8 eyes. Immunocytology revealed elevated levels of interleukin (IL)-10 (12,783.5 pg/mL), IL-6 (26.7 pg/mL), and IgH gene rearrangement. Three patients were treated with EBRT, 6 eyes with intravitreal methotrexate (median, 9.5; range, 2-15), and 2 eyes with intravitreal rituximab injections (median, 4; range, 2-6). Two patients developed marked keratitis because of methotrexate toxicity. At median follow-up of 33.5 months (range, 4-96), VRL had resolved in 7 eyes and persistent in 5 eyes.

528,"Field response of the twig beetle, Pityophthorus pubescens, to the aggregation pheromone, (E)-(+)-pityol, is not inhibited by (E)-(-)-pityol, and evidence of monogyny Field studies were conducted to determine the flight response of the twig beetle Pityophthorus pubescens (Marsham) (Coleoptera: Curculionidae: Scolytinae) to the potential aggregation pheromone component, (E)-(+)-pityol, and its racemic form, (E)-(+/-)-pityol, in different Pinus spp. L. (Pinales: Pinaceae) stands in the Basque Country (Northern Spain). Both (E)-(+)-pityol and (E)-(+/-)-pityol equally attracted more males than females, and they were all significantly different from the blank controls. Data about P. pubescens gallery systems in naturally infested P. radiata D. Don branches are also provided. The presence of one male and one female was the most common gallery habitation found in debarked twigs. Current results suggest that P. pubescens may be monogynous and females might mediate the aggregation of mating partners.",Excluded
2085,"Proctitis 1 week after stereotactic body radiation therapy for prostate cancer: Implications for clinical trial design Background: Proctitis following prostate cancer radiation therapy is a primary determinant of quality of life (QOL). While previous studies have assessed acute rectal morbidity at 1 month after stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT), little data exist on the prevalence and severity of rectal morbidity within the first week following treatment. This study reports the acute bowel morbidity 1 week following prostate SBRT. Material(s) and Method(s): Between May 2013 and August 2014, 103 patients with clinically localized prostate cancer were treated with 35-36.25 Gy in five fractions using robotic SBRT delivered on a prospective clinical trial. Bowel toxicity was graded using the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events version 4.0 (CTCAEv.4). Bowel QOL was assessed using the EPIC-26 questionnaire bowel domain at baseline, 1 week, 1 month, and 3 months. Time-dependent changes in bowel symptoms were statistically compared using the Wilcoxon signed-rank test. Clinically significant change was assessed by the minimally important difference (MID) in EPIC score. This was defined as a change of 1/2 standard deviation (SD) from the baseline score. Result(s): One-hundred and three patients with a minimum of 3 months of follow-up were analyzed. The cumulative incidence of acute grade 2 gastrointestinal (GI) toxicity was 23%. There were no acute >= grade 3 bowel toxicities. EPIC bowel summary scores maximally declined at 1 week after SBRT (-13.9, p < 0.0001) before returning to baseline at 3 months after SBRT (+0.03, p = 0.94). Prior to treatment, 4.9% of men reported that their bowel bother was a moderate to big problem. This increased to 28.4% (p < 0.0001) 1 week after SBRT and returned to baseline at 3 months after SBRT (0.0%, p = 0.66). Only the bowel summary and bowel bother score declines at 1 week met the MID threshold for clinically significant change. Conclusion(s): The rate and severity of acute proctitis following prostate SBRT peaked at 1 week after treatment and returned to baseline by 3 months. Toxicity assessment at 1 week can therefore minimize recall bias and should aid in the design of future clinical trials focused on accurately capturing and minimizing acute morbidity following SBRT.Copyright © 2016 Paydar, Cyr, Yung, Lei, Collins, Chen, Suy, Dritschilo, Lynch and Collins.",Excluded
590,"Upregulation of VEGF and FGF2 in normal rat brain after experimental intraoperative radiation therapy The expression of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and fibroblast growth factor (FGF)2 in the irradiated brain was examined to test how a single high dose radiation, similar to that used for intraoperative radiation therapy given to the normal cerebrum, can affect the vascular endothelium. After a burr hole trephination in the rat skull, the cerebral hemisphere was exposed to a single 10 Gy dose of gamma rays, and the radiation effect was assessed at 1, 2, 4, 6, and 8 weeks after irradiation. Histological changes, such as reactive gliosis, inflammation, vascular proliferation and necrosis, were correlated with the duration after irradiation. Significant VEGF and FGF2 expression in the 2- and 8-week were detected by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay quantification in the radiation group. Immunohistochemical study for VEGF was done and the number of positive cells gradually increased over time, compared with the sham operation group. In conclusion, the radiation injuries consisted of radiation necrosis associated with the expression of VEGF and FGF2. These findings indicate that VEGF and FGF2 may play a role in the radiation injuries after intraoperative single high-dose irradiation.",Included
411,"Parkinson's disease: a test of the multifactorial etiologic hypothesis We studied the relative etiologic importance upon the development of Parkinson's disease (PD) of occupational exposure to herbicides and other compounds, ionizing radiation exposure, family history of PD and essential tremor, smoking, and history of various viral and other medical conditions. We identified patients (n = 130) with neurologist-confirmed idiopathic PD through contacts with Calgary general hospitals, long-term care facilities, neurologists, the Movement Disorder Clinic, and the Parkinson's Society of Southern Alberta, and selected two matched (by sex and age +/- 2.5 years) community controls for each case by random digit dialing. We obtained lifetime work, chemical, radiation, medical, and smoking exposure histories and family histories of PD and essential tremor by personal interviews, and analyzed the data using conditional logistic regression for matched sets. After controlling for potential confounding and interaction between the exposure variables, using multivariate statistical methods, having a family history of PD was the strongest predictor of PD risk, followed by head trauma and then occupational herbicide use. Cases and controls did not differ in their previous exposures to smoking or ionizing radiation; family history of essential tremor; work-related contact with aluminum, carbon monoxide, cyanide, manganese, mercury, or mineral oils; or history of arteriosclerosis, chicken pox, encephalitis, hypertension, hypotension, measles, mumps, rubella, or Spanish flu. These results support the hypothesis of a multifactorial etiology for PD, probably involving genetic, environmental, trauma, and possibly other factors.",Excluded

Method(s): A total of 52 patients (24 male, 28 female; mean age: 55.1+/-14.3; age range: 21-82 years) who had PET/CT in our department due to histologically proven metastasis or had a high clinical suspicion for malignancy were included in the study. The results of 18F-FDG PET/CT and clinical follow-up data were reviewed retrospectively. Histologically analysis and/or clinical follow-up data were accepted gold standard in the confirmation 18F-FDG PET/CT results. Patients were evaluated in two groups as 29 patients with histologically proven metastasis (group 1) and 23 patients with clinical suspicion of malignancy (group 2). Result(s): Primary site of malignancy was discovered in 16 of 52 patients (30.7%) histologically. Twelve of 16 patients (75%) was in group 1 and 4 patients was in group 2. In the remaining patients (36/52; 69.3%) primary tumor sites were not found by PET/CT. The findings for group 1 and 2 were TN in 15 and 18 patients, respectively. In 3 patients, 18F-FDG PET/CT findings were discordant with gold standard and all of them had FP findings. Primary tumor site could not be determined in none of patients with negative PET/CT. Regarding the whole patient population, a sensitivity and specificity of 18F-FDG PET/CT for detecting primary site were calculated 100% and 91% respectively. Regarding the patients groups, the sensitivity and specificity of 18F-FDG PET/CT for group 1 and group 2 were calculated 100% and 88%; 100% and 94% respectively.

3504,"Outcomes of subintimal plaque modification in chronic total occlusion percutaneous coronary intervention Background: When crossing into the distal true lumen fails during chronic total occlusion (CTO) percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), subintimal plaque modification (SPM) is often performed to restore antegrade flow and facilitate subsequent lesion recanalization. Method(s): Between January 2012 and May 4, 2019, 4,659 CTO PCIs were included in the PROGRESS-CTO registry, of which 935 (20%) had a prior unsuccessful attempt. Of those 935 patients, 119 (13%) had prior SPM. We analyzed the outcomes of the 58 SPM procedures for which data were available, as well as the outcomes of the 60 subsequent CTO PCI attempts. Result(s): Mean patient age was 67 +/- 9 years and 86% were men. Patients had high prevalence of cardiovascular risk factors such as dyslipidemia (91%), hypertension (93%) diabetes (48%), prior PCI (61%), and prior coronary artery bypass graft surgery (47%). The target CTO lesions often had proximal cap ambiguity (54%), moderate/severe calcification (73%), moderate/severe tortuosity (63%), and high J-CTO score (mean 3.2 +/- 1.1). The technical and procedural success of subsequent CTO PCI were high (83% for both) with an acceptable rate of in-hospital major adverse cardiovascular events (3.3%). Technical and procedural success were higher for repeat attempts that were performed >=60 days after the index CTO PCI (94% vs. 69%, p =.015). Median (interquartile range) subsequent procedure time was 147 (100, 215) min, contrast volume was 185 (150, 260) ml, and air kerma radiation dose was 2.5 (1.4, 4.2) Gray.

1176,"Are navigation techniques risk-benefit effective for vertebral transpedicular instrumentation? A prospective comparative study BACKGROUND CONTEXT: Pedicle screw malposition is very common and may cause neurological, vascular and visceral injuries and compromise mechanical stability. Image-guided surgical techniques have reduced the risk of serious complications and have improved the mechanical stability of pedicle screws. PURPOSE: The purpose of this study is to compare the malposition rate between intraoperative navigation and free-hand fluoroscopy-guided techniques for placement of pedicle screw instrumentation. STUDY DESIGN/SETTING: Prospective observational study. PATIENT SAMPLE: All consecutive patients with degenerative disease (degenerative disc disease, listhesis, scoliosis, lumbar stenosis), with instrumentation between T10 and S1, who underwent surgical procedures using the free-hand or intraoperative navigation technique for placement of transpedicular instrumentation were included in the study. METHOD(S): Radiological analysis of the position of the transpedicular screws was performed usisng a 1-mm spinal CT scan. Evaluation of axial slices as well as sagittal and coronal reconstructions were carried out. Analysis of screw position was assessed using the Heary classification. Breach severity was defined according to the Gertzbein classification. Radiation doses were evaluated usisng thermoluminiscent dosimeter (TLD) and estimates of effective dose and organ dose were made based on the scan technical parameters. RESULT(S): A total of 114 patients were included; 58 were operated on using assisted surgery and 56 using free-hand fluoroscopy-guided surgery. A total of 625 screws were implanted (575 below L3 and 50 between T10 and L2): 52% in the navigation-assisted surgery group and 48% in the free-hand surgery group. The total number of malpositioned screws was: 11 (3.6%) in the navigated surgery group (right side: n=7, left side: n=4) and 33 (10.3%) in the free-hand group (right side: n=23, left side: n=10) (p<.001). Screw position according to the Heary scale was: grade II (4 navigated surgery, 6 fluoroscopy guided), grade III (3 navigated surgery, 11 fluoroscopy guided), grade IV (4 navigated surgery, 15 fluoroscopy guided) and grade V (1 fluoroscopy guided). There was only one symptomatic case in the fluoroscopy guided group. Breach severity was as follows: 7 grade A and 4 grade B in the navigated surgery group and 8 grade A, 24 grade B and 1 breach >4 mm grade C in free-hand fluoroscopy-guided group. The radiation received per patient was 5.8 mSv (4.8-7.3). The mean dose received by patients in the free-hand fluoroscopy group was 1 mGy (0.8-1.1). There was no detectable radiation level in the navigation-assisted surgery group whereas the effective dose was 10microGy in the free-hand fluoroscopy-guided surgery group. CONCLUSION(S): The malposition rate, both, symptomatic and asymptomatic, in spinal surgery is reduced when using navigation assisted transpedicular intrumentation compared to placement under fluoroscopic guidance, with radiation values within the safety limits for health. Larger studies, specially in levels above L1, which are the ones that may benefit most from navigated surgery are needed to determine risk-benefit in these patients.",Excluded
2748,"The results of hypofractionated radiotherapy in 31 patients with high-grade gliomas In this prospective study, we investigated the effects of hypofractionated radiotherapy for patients with high-grade gliomas. About 31 patients with glioblastoma multiforme or anaplastic astrocytoma were studied between October 2003 and December 2004. Hypofractionated radiotherapy (3 Gy/fraction/day) was delivered to a total dose of 45 Gy in 15 fractions in 10 patients (32%) who had total excision before radiotherapy and to a total dose of 54 Gy in 18 fractions in 21 patients (68%) who had subtotal excision or biopsy alone. Sex, age, type of surgery, tumor grade, Karnofsky performance status, time between surgery and initiation of radiotherapy, and total radiotherapy dose were analyzed as potential prognostic factors for survival using the univariate log-rank method. The median follow-up was 15 months (4-16 months). A total of 15 patients (48%) died of their illness; 16 patients (52%) were still alive at the last follow-up. The median survival time was 8 months. Actuarial 1-year overall survival was 40%. Type of surgery, timing of radiotherapy after surgery, and initial Karnofsky performance status were significant prognostic factors for survival. No grade 3-4 acute or late neurotoxicity was observed. The tolerance of patients to hypofractionated RT was not different from that for conventional radiotherapy. This treatment schedule can be used for patients with high-grade gliomas.

1240,"Rapid detection of radiation-induced chromosomal aberrations in lymphocytes and hematopoietic progenitor cells by mFISH Structural chromosome aberrations (SCAs) are sensitive indicators of a preceding exposure of the hematopoietic system to ionizing radiation. Cytogenetic investigations have therefore become routine tools for an assessment of absorbed radiation doses and their biological effects after occupational exposure or radiation accidents.Due to its speed and ease of use, fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) with whole chromosome painting (WCP) probes has become a method of choice to visualize SCAs. Until recently, this technique was limited to a rather small number of chromosomes, which could be tested simultaneously. As a result, only a fraction of the structural aberrations present in a sample could be detected and the overall dose effect had to be calculated by extrapolation. The recent introduction of two genome-wide screening techniques in tumor research, i.e., Spectral Karyotyping (SKY) and multicolor FISH (mFISH) now allows the detection of translocations involving any two non-homologous chromosomes.The present study was prompted by our desire to bring the power of mFISH to bear for the rapid identification of radiation-induced SCAs. We chose two model systems to investigate the utility of mFISH: lymphocytes that were exposed in vitro to 3 Gy photons and single hematopoietic progenitor cell colonies isolated from a Chernobyl victim 9 years after in vivo exposure to 5.4 Sv.In lymphocytes, we found up to 15 different chromosomes involved in rearrangements indicating complex radiation effects. Stable aberrations detected in hematopoietic cell colonies, on the other hand, showed involvement of up to three different chromosomes. These results demonstrated that mFISH is a rapid and powerful approach to detect and characterize radiation-induced SCAs in the hemopoietic system. The application of mFISH is expected to result in a more detailed and, thus, more informative picture of radiation effects. Eventually, this technique will allow researchers to rapidly delineate chromosomal breakpoints and facilitate the identification of the genes involved in radiation tumorigenesis.

1722,"Three-dimensional analysis of recurrence patterns in rectal cancer: The cranial border in hypofractionated preoperative radiotherapy can be lowered Purpose: The aim of this study was to determine whether and where the radiotherapy (RT) clinical target volume (CTV) could be reduced in short-course preoperative treatment of rectal cancer patients. Methods and Materials: Patients treated in the Dutch total mesorectal excision trial, with a local recurrence were analyzed. For 94 (25 who underwent radiation therapy 69 who did not) of 114 patients with a local recurrence, the location of the recurrence was placed in a three-dimensionalthree (3D) model. The data in the 3D model were correlated to the clinical trial data to distinguish a group of patients eligible for CTV reduction. Effects of CTV reduction on dose to the small bowel was tested retrospectively in a dataset of 8 patients with three-field conformal plans and intensity-modulated RT (IMRT). Result(s): The use of preoperative RT mainly reduces anastomotic, lateral, and perineal recurrences. In patients without primary nodal involvement, no recurrences were found cranially of the S2-S3 interspace, irrespective of the delivery of RT. In patients without primary nodal involvement and a negative circumferential resection margin (CRM), only one recurrence was found cranial to the S2-S3 interspace. With a cranially reduced CTV to the S2-S3 interspace, over 60% reduction in absolute small bowel exposure at dose levels from 15 to 35 Gy could be achieved with three-field conventional RT, increasing to 80% when IMRT is also added. Conclusion(s): The cranial border of the CTV can safely be lowered for patients without expected nodal or CRM involvement, yielding a significant reduction of dose to the small bowel. Therefore, a significant reduction of acute and late toxicity can be expected. © 2011 Elsevier Inc.",Excluded
2805,"Radiation Dose-Dependent Hippocampal Atrophy Detected With Longitudinal Volumetric Magnetic Resonance Imaging PURPOSE: After radiation therapy (RT) to the brain, patients often experience memory impairment, which may be partially mediated by damage to the hippocampus. Hippocampal sparing in RT planning is the subject of recent and ongoing clinical trials. Calculating appropriate hippocampal dose constraints would be improved by efficient in vivo measurements of hippocampal damage. In this study we sought to determine whether brain RT was associated with dose-dependent hippocampal atrophy., METHODS AND MATERIALS: Hippocampal volume was measured with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in 52 patients who underwent fractionated, partial brain RT for primary brain tumors. Study patients had high-resolution, 3-dimensional volumetric MRI before and 1 year after RT. Images were processed using software with clearance from the US Food and Drug Administration and Conformite Europeene marking for automated measurement of hippocampal volume. Automated results were inspected visually for accuracy. Tumor and surgical changes were censored. Mean hippocampal dose was tested for correlation with hippocampal atrophy 1 year after RT. Average hippocampal volume change was also calculated for hippocampi receiving high (>40 Gy) or low (<10 Gy) mean RT dose. A multivariate analysis was conducted with linear mixed-effects modeling to evaluate other potential predictors of hippocampal volume change, including patient (random effect), age, hemisphere, sex, seizure history, and baseline volume. Statistical significance was evaluated at alpha = 0.05., RESULTS: Mean hippocampal dose was significantly correlated with hippocampal volume loss (r=-0.24, P=.03). Mean hippocampal volume was significantly reduced 1 year after high-dose RT (mean -6%, P=.009) but not after low-dose RT. In multivariate analysis, both RT dose and patient age were significant predictors of hippocampal atrophy (P<.01)., CONCLUSIONS: The hippocampus demonstrates radiation dose-dependent atrophy after treatment for brain tumors. Quantitative MRI is a noninvasive imaging technique capable of measuring radiation effects on intracranial structures. This technique could be investigated as a potential biomarker for development of reliable dose constraints for improved cognitive outcomes. Copyright © 2016 Elsevier Inc.

1235,"Altered mechanical behavior of demineralized bone following therapeutic radiation Post-radiotherapy (RTx) bone fragility fractures are a late-onset complication occurring in bone within or underlying the radiation field. These fractures are difficult to predict, as patients do not present with local osteopenia. Using a murine hindlimb RTx model, we previously documented decreased mineralized bone strength and fracture toughness, but alterations in material properties of the organic bone matrix are largely unknown. In this study, 4 days of fractionated hindlimb irradiation (4 x 5 Gy) or Sham irradiation was administered in a mouse model (BALB/cJ, end points: 0, 4, 8, and 12 weeks, n = 15/group/end point). Following demineralization, the viscoelastic stress relaxation, and monotonic tensile mechanical properties of tibiae were determined. Irradiated tibiae demonstrated an immediate (day after last radiation fraction) and sustained (4, 8, 12 weeks) increase in stress relaxation compared to the Sham group, with a 4.4% decrease in equilibrium stress (p <.017). While tensile strength was not different between groups, irradiated tibiae had a lower elastic modulus (-5%, p =.027) and energy to failure (-12.2%, p =.012) with monotonic loading. Gel electrophoresis showed that therapeutic irradiation (4 x 5 Gy) does not result in collagen fragmentation, while irradiation at a common sterilization dose (25 kGy) extensively fragmented collagen. These results suggest that altered collagen mechanical behavior has a role in postirradiation bone fragility, but this can occur without detectable collagen fragmentation. Statement of Clinical Significance: Therapeutic irradiation alters bone organic matrix mechanics and which contribute to diminished fatigue strength, but this does not occur via collagen fragmentation.Copyright © 2020 Orthopaedic Research Society.

Method(s): Between 1980 and 1988 at Varese University Hospital, 60 consecutive patients with T2N0 glottic carcinoma received exclusive radiotherapy consisting of 1.5 Gy/fraction twice a day. Treatment gaps during the radiotherapy course were allowed according to individual tolerance. This policy resulted in a wide range of elapsed treatment time: median, 5.7 weeks; range, 3.7-8.9. Median follow-up is 9.8 years. Result(s): As a result of dose/time distribution, 16, 20 and 24 patients received an average weekly dose rate of <10 Gy/week, equal to 10 Gy/week or >10 Gy/week, respectively. Mean total dose for each group was 62.8 Gy, 63.7 Gy and 63.8 Gy, respectively. Five-year local-regional control was 69 +/- 6% (95% CI); ultimate local-regional control, including salvage surgery, was 78 +/- 5%. All failures were at the primary site, and no patient developed neck recurrence as first site of failure. The actuarial incidence of grade 2-3 late reactions at 5 years was 42 +/- 6%. Most late toxicity events were grade 2: only 2 patients developed grade 3 reactions and none grade 4. None of the several clinical and treatment-related variables showed any statistically significant impact on local-regional control or late toxicity at univariate and multivariate analysis. In particular, 3-year local-regional control rates were 73 +/- 11%, 84 +/- 8% and 69 +/- 10% for an average weekly dose rate of <10 Gy/week, equal to 10 Gy/week and >10 Gy/week, respectively (not significantly different).

However, it remains unclear whether low-field MRI results in sufficient image quality with limited metal artefacts. Therefore, this feasibility study explored the diagnostic value of low-field MRI concerning pathologies associated with problematic TKA's' by comparing low-field MRI findings with CT and surgical findings. Secondly, differences in patellofemoral parameters between supine and weight-bearing low-field MRI were evaluated. Method(s): Eight patients with a problematic TKA were scanned using low-field MRI in weight-bearing and supine conditions. Six of these patients underwent revision surgery. Scans were analysed by a radiologist for pathologies associated with a problematic TKA. Additional patellofemoral and alignment parameters were measured by an imaging expert. MRI observations were compared to those obtained with CT, the diagnosis based on the clinical work-up, and findings during revision surgery. Result(s): MRI observations of rotational malalignment, component loosening and patellofemoral arthrosis were comparable with the clinical diagnosis (six out of eight) and were confirmed during surgery (four out of six). All MRI observations were in line with CT findings (seven out of seven). Clinical diagnosis and surgical findings of collateral excessive laxity could not be confirmed with MRI (two out of eight).

498,"Estimation of the displacement of cardiac substructures and the motion of the coronary arteries using electrocardiographic gating Purpose: The aim of this study was to quantify the displacement of cardiac substructures, including the anterior myocardial territory (AMT), left ventricle, and coronary arteries during a normal cardiac cycle. Material(s) and Method(s): Computed tomography (CT) images with retrospective electrocardiographic gating of 17 eligible patients were obtained. All images were reconstructed automatically for the end-diastolic and end-systolic phases. CT scanning without contrast at a random phase and a selected vertebral body were used as references to measure three-dimensionaldisplacements of the cardiac substructures. Result(s): The displacement between the end-diastolic and end-systolic phases (Dd-s) was greater than that between the end-systolic and random phases and between the end-diastolic and random cardiac phases. The largest displacements for the heart were in the left, posterior, and inferior directions with an average Dd-s of approximately 4-6 mm. The average Dd-s for the AMT and left ventricle was 1.2-2.7 mm in the anterior and right directions, 4.3-7.8 mm in left and posterior directions, and 4.9-6.3 mm in superior and inferior directions. For the coronary arteries, the average Dd-s was 2.8-5.9 mm in the anterior-posterior direction, 3.5-6.6 mm in left-right direction, and 3.8-5.3 mm in the superior-inferior direction. Inter-observer agreement was excellent for the heart, AMT, and left ventricle (kappa coefficient, >0.75 for all) and good for most coronary arteries in three dimensions (kappa coefficient, 0.511-0.687). The Dd-s did not differ significantly between men and women. Conclusion(s): Most average displacements of the cardiac substructures and coronary arteries were 3-8 mm in three dimensions. These findings will be useful to accurately estimate the radiation dose to cardiac substructures during thoracic radiation and to evaluate the risk of radiation-related heart disease. © 2013 Tan et al.

3480,"Radioiodide (131I) therapy for the treatment of canine thyroid carcinoma OBJECTIVE: To assess the efficacy of radioactive iodine treatment (131I) for canine thyroid carcinoma, as both the sole therapeutic modality and as an adjunct to surgery. DESIGN: Retrospective analysis of case records from the Gladesville Veterinary Hospital Nuclear Medicine Service, Sydney, between August 1988 and December 2001. CASE DETAILS: The records of 65 dogs with thyroid carcinoma were analysed according to therapy and outcome. Forty-three dogs received radioiodide therapy, either as the sole therapeutic modality (32) or as an adjunct to surgery (11). Radioisotope therapy consisted of one to three doses of 131I with a dose range of 555 to 1850 MBq. For analysis, dogs were divided into groups according to therapy: no treatment, surgery alone, surgery with radioiodide therapy or radioiodide therapy alone. Mode of therapy, dosage of 131I, clinical staging and age were all independently analysed according to survival to compare efficacy or predictive value respectively. RESULT(S): When radioiodide therapy was used as an adjunct to surgery, median survival was 34 months. Censored median survival time for dogs that received radioiodide alone was 30 months. Dogs that did not receive treatment had a median survival of only 3 months. Log rank statistical analysis indicated that mode of therapy was significantly correlated with survival but that clinical stage of disease was not. CONCLUSION(S): The authors conclude that 131I therapy is effective at extending survival time, both as a sole therapeutic modality and as an adjunct to surgery, in dogs with invasive canine thyroid carcinoma. Incomplete surgical resection may not prolong survival in dogs also receiving 131I therapy, however surgical resection with curative intent should be recommended as the first line of therapy for mobile thyroid carcinomas. Radioisotope therapy can be recommended for cases where surgery alone is considered unlikely to be curative because of metastatic disease or local invasion, or for cases where surgery has been attempted but complete surgical removal has not been achieved.",Excluded

3315,"Clustered Ca2+ Channels Are Blocked by Synaptic Vesicle Proton Release at Mammalian Auditory Ribbon Synapses A Ca2+ current transient block (ICaTB) by protons occurs at some ribbon-type synapses after exocytosis, but this has not been observed at mammalian hair cells. Here we show that a robust ICaTB occurs at post-hearing mouse and gerbil inner hair cell (IHC) synapses, but not in immature IHC synapses, which contain non-compact active zones, where Ca2+ channels are loosely coupled to the release sites. Unlike ICaTB at other ribbon synapses, ICaTB in mammalian IHCs displays a surprising multi-peak structure that mirrors the EPSCs seen in paired recordings. Desynchronizing vesicular release with intracellular BAPTA or by deleting otoferlin, the Ca2+ sensor for exocytosis, greatly reduces ICaTB, whereas enhancing release synchronization by raising Ca2+ influx or temperature increases ICaTB. This suggests that ICaTB is produced by fast multivesicular proton-release events. We propose that ICaTB may function as a submillisecond feedback mechanism contributing to the auditory nerve's fast spike adaptation during sound stimulation., Mature inner hair cells in the cochlea contain compact active zones where clustered Ca2+ channels are tightly coupled to the sites of vesicle fusion. Vincent et al. show that vesicle exocytosis leads to the release of protons into the synaptic cleft, which transiently blocks a subset of Ca2+ channels.Copyright © 2018",Excluded
2742,"Estimates of Environmental Exposure to Radiofrequency Electromagnetic Fields and Risk of Lymphoma Subtypes We investigated the association between environmental exposure to radiofrequency electromagnetic fields (RF-EMF) and risk of lymphoma subtypes in a case-control study comprised of 322 patients and 444 individuals serving as controls in Sardinia, Italy in 1998-2004. Questionnaire information included the self-reported distance of the three longest held residential addresses from fixed radio-television transmitters and mobile phone base stations. We georeferenced the residential addresses of all study subjects and obtained the spatial coordinates of mobile phone base stations. For each address within a 500-meter radius from a mobile phone base station, we estimated the RF-EMF intensity using predictions from spatial models, and we performed RF-EMF measurements at the door in the subset of the longest held addresses within a 250-meter radius. We calculated risk of lymphoma and its major subtypes associated with the RF-EMF exposure metrics with unconditional logistic regression, adjusting by age, gender and years of education. In the analysis of self-reported data, risk associated with residence in proximity (within 50 meters) to fixed radio-television transmitters was likewise elevated for lymphoma overall [odds ratio = 2.7, 95% confidence interval = 1.5-4.6], and for the major lymphoma subtypes. With reference to mobile phone base stations, we did not observe an association with either the self-reported, or the geocoded distance from mobile phone base stations. RF-EMF measurements did not vary by case-control status. By comparing the self-reports to the geocoded data, we discovered that the cases tended to underestimate the distance from mobile phone base stations differentially from the controls (P = 0.073). The interpretation of our findings is compromised by the limited study size, particularly in the analysis of the individual lymphoma subtypes, and the unavailability of the spatial coordinates of radio-television transmitters. Nonetheless, our results do not support the hypothesis of a link between environmental exposure to RF-EMF from mobile phone base stations and risk of lymphoma subtypes.Copyright © 2018 by Radiation Research Society.",Excluded
2469,"Nasal cytological changes as late effects of radiotherapy for nasopharyngeal cancer Background: Radiation therapy is a cornerstone in nasopharyngeal cancer treatment. However, it can induce acute and long-term adverse effects, such as acute mucositis and late submucosal fibrosis. Late toxicities could not only affect submucosa but also mucosal cells, determining long-term cytological changes. Objective(s): Evaluation of delayed nasal cytological alterations in patients who underwent radiation therapy for nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC). Method(s): In this case-control study, we analyzed 30 healthy subjects and 30 patients treated with chemotherapy and radiotherapy for NPC between 2003 and 2011, with a median follow-up of 59 months. All subjects underwent symptoms anamnestic evaluation (rhinorrea, nasal obstruction), endoscopic fiber optic nasal examination, skin-prick tests, and nasal scraping for cytological exam. Result(s): A higher percentage of rhinorrhea, nasal obstruction, mucosal hyperemia, and presence of nasopharyngeal secretions at fiber optic endoscopic exam was found in radiated subjects (p < 0.05). Nasal cytology analysis demonstrated a higher percentage of neutrophilic inflammation and squamous cell metaplasia and mucous cell metaplasia in treated patients (p < 0.05). No cytological atypia was seen. No statistically significant correlation between nasal cytological changes and objective findings, patients' age, tobacco smoking, and gastroesophageal reflux has been found in the radiotherapy group (p > 0.05). Conclusion(s): Radiation therapy induces late nasal mucosal changes, which may be related to clinical consequences, such as abundant mucus production and its consequent endonasal stagnation. In the future, detailed knowledge of cytological changes in patients' nasal mucosa could represent a key prerequisite for the choice of effective interventions for late radiation-induced rhinitis.Copyright © 2015, OceanSide Publications, Inc., U.S.A.",Excluded
3582,"Optic radiation tractography and visual field deficits in laser interstitial thermal therapy for amygdalohippocampectomy in patients with mesial temporal lobe epilepsy Background/Aims: Laser interstitial thermal therapy (LITT) has become an alternative to open-resective surgery for refractory mesial temporal lobe epilepsy (MTLE). Occurrence of visual field defects (VFDs) following open surgery for MTLE is reported at 52-100%. We examined the rate of VFDs following LITT for amygdalohippocampectomy (AHE) and correlated the occurrence of VFDs with damage to the optic radiations, assessed by diffusion tensor tractography (DTI). Method(s): We performed a retrospective analysis of 5 patients who underwent LITT-AHE for medically refractory MTLE. We examined the association between VFDs and optic radiation damage by correlating postprocedural visual field testing with qualitative assessment of optic radiation fiber tracts. Result(s): Postoperative assessments showed that 4 patients had normal visual field testing, and 1 had a right superior quadrantanopsia (20%). We performed 3-dimensional reconstruction of the optic radiation, laser probe trajectory, and ablation volume. Damage to Meyer's loop was determined consistent with the VFD. Conclusion(s): Short-term follow-up in our series suggests that laser ablation AHE may be associated with a lower rate of VFD than has been reported for open AHE. Our results suggest that incorporating optic radiation mapping through DTI may preoperatively help to minimize the risk of VFD following laser ablation AHE.Copyright © 2017 S.

1047,"Thermophysiological consequences of whole body resonant RF exposure (100 MHz) in human volunteers Thermophysiological responses of heat production and heat loss were measured in seven adult volunteers (six males and one female, aged 31-74 years) during 45 min dorsal exposures of the whole body to 100 MHz continuous wave (CW) radio frequency (RF) energy. Three power densities (PD) (average PD = 4, 6, and 8 mW/cm(2); whole body specific absorption rate [SAR] = 0.068 [W/kg]/[mW/cm(2)]) were tested in each of three ambient temperatures (T(a) = 24, 28, and 31 degrees C), as well as in T(a) controls (no RF). A standardized protocol (30 min baseline, 45 min RF or sham exposure, 10 min baseline) was used. Measured responses included esophageal and seven skin temperatures, metabolic heat production, local sweat rate, and local skin blood flow. No changes in metabolic heat production occurred under any test condition. Unlike published results of similar exposures at 450 and 2450 MHz, local skin temperatures, even those on the back that were irradiated directly, changed little or not at all during 100 MHz exposures. The sole exception was the temperature of the ankle skin, which increased by 3-4 degrees C in some subjects at PD = 8 mW/cm(2). During the 45 min RF exposure, esophageal temperature showed modest changes (range = -0.15 to 0.13 degrees C) and never exceeded 37.2 degrees C. Thermoregulation was principally controlled by appropriate increases in evaporative heat loss (sweating) and, to a lesser extent, by changes in skin blood flow. Because of the deep penetration of RF energy at this frequency, effectively bypassing the skin, these changes must have been stimulated by thermal receptors deep in the body rather than those located in the skin.

663,"Staff radiation dose and estimated risk in an interventional radiology department In interventional radiology attendant staff can be exposed to significant doses from the radiation scattered from the patient, giving rise to heterogeneous energy distribution, exposure occurring over extended periods of time. Protection of staff is a prime concern, also including reducing the risk of carcinogenesis. With only limited published studies available, as in for instance in regard to lens opacifications, further evaluation of staff exposures and assessment of radiation protection techniques and measures are crucial. Present study has sought to evaluate staff radiation exposure in a radiology department that performs interventional procedures. Annual occupational exposures were obtained for 32 personnel (6 females and 26 males) in a radiology department at a tertiary hospital. Personal dose equivalent Hp (d) was measured in terms of Hp (0.07) (shallow dose) and Hp (10) (deep dose). The measurements were made over a period of two consecutive years, 2017 and 2018, use being made of TLD-100 thermoluminescent dosimeters. In units of mSv, the corresponding average annual dose equivalent and range for Hp (10) and Hp (0.07) were 4.6 +/- 7.0 (0.1-25.5) and 5.1 +/- 7.3 (0.1-25.5). Notably, 16% of staff received doses that were greater than the annual dose limit. Since Hp (10) offers a conservative evaluation of effective dose, evaluation of the working environment is necessary in seeking to ensure dose values remain below annual dose limits.Copyright © 2020 Elsevier Ltd",Excluded

QoL was evaluated with the validated version of Spanish AKQoL questionnaire. Skin self-examination, sun-exposure, habits and attitudes towards AK's treatment were recorded using different questionnaires. The adherence was assessed by means of the Morisky-Green test. Among other variables, QoL and adherence to treatment were compared by using Pearson's chi2 test and one-way ANOVA tests. Inferential analysis regarding such factors and length of treatment were also performed., RESULTS: A total of 1240 patients (73.6 [10.5] years old) were recruited. Overall, patients that showed higher levels of concern were also showed a higher impairment on QoL. AK had greater effects on women's QoL and those who performed skin self-examination, think that AK is a disease and/or believe that moisturizers can prevent skin aging (P<.05). Adherence and length of treatment were strongly related, since patients with treatments intended for <1week were more likely to show good adherence and complete remission of AK (Odds Ratio [95%CI]: 6.25 [4.55-8.33] and 2.63 [1.96-3.45]), respectively)., CONCLUSIONS: Concerns due to AK are mainly related to sex and to the consideration of AK as a disease. More concerned patients tend to have lower QoL and good adherence to treatment. Short length of treatment was associated with better adherence and complete remission of AK lesions.

1287,"Effects of a static magnetic field on audiogenic seizures in black Swiss mice Effects of a static magnetic field (SMF) with strong gradient components were studied in black Swiss mice. Exposure to SMF (100-220 mT, 15-40 T/m for 1h) did not affect the threshold for detecting auditory brainstem responses. Serial seizures elevated the hearing threshold at some frequencies, but there was no difference between SMF-exposed and unexposed control mice. EEG changes were recorded during audiogenic seizures. Pretreatment with SMF prolonged seizure latency in response to stimulation with white noise of increasing intensity from 74 to 102 dBA (1 min interval between 2 and 4 dBA increments) without significant effects on seizure severity. Gender-related differences were not statistically significant. Stimulation with 10 min sound steps revealed prolongation of latency and reduction of seizure severity in SMF-exposed, but not unexposed, mice. Pretreatment with phenytoin (5 mg/kg) in combination with SMF had significantly greater effects on seizure latency and severity than either pretreatment alone. These findings indicate that the SMF studied here under different conditions elevated seizure threshold and had anticonvulsant properties in Black Swiss mice and increased the efficacy of a conventional anticonvulsant drug.",Excluded
2943,"Statistical shape modeling predicts patellar bone geometry to enable stereo-radiographic kinematic tracking Complications in the patellofemoral (PF) joint of patients with total knee replacements include patellar subluxation and dislocation, and remain a cause for revision. Kinematic measurements to assess these complications and evaluate implant designs require the accuracy of dynamic stereo-radiographic systems with 3D-2D registration techniques. While tibiofemoral kinematics are typically derived by tracking metallic implants, PF kinematic measurements are difficult as the patellar implant is radiotransparent and a representation of the resected patella bone requires either pre-surgical imaging and precise implant placement or post-surgical imaging. Statistical shape models (SSMs), used to characterize anatomic variation, provide an alternative means to obtain the representation of the resected patella for use in kinematic tracking. Using a virtual platform of a stereo-radiographic system, the objectives of this study were to evaluate the ability of an SSM to predict subject-specific 3D implanted patellar geometries from simulated 2D image profiles, and to formulate an effective data collection methodology for PF kinematics by considering accuracy for a variety of patient pose scenarios. An SSM of the patella was developed for 50 subjects and a leave-one-out approach compared SSM-predicted and actual geometries; average 3D errors were 0.45 +/- 0.07 mm (mean +/- standard deviation), which is comparable to the accuracy of traditional segmentation. Further, initial imaging of the patella in five unique stereo radiographic perspectives yielded the most accurate representation. The ability to predict the remaining patellar geometry of the implanted PF joint with radiographic images and SSM, instead of CT, can reduce radiation exposure and streamline in vivo kinematic evaluations.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Ltd",Excluded

2139,"Complete histopathological regression in rectal cancer after neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy and sphincter preserving surgical treatment Background/Aim. Multimodal approach to locally advanced rectal cancer treatment results in better disease outcome. Preoperative chemoradiotherapy improves disease local control, reduces risk of local recurrence and in the majority of patients with complete or substantial regression of the tumors significantly improves survival rates. According to the literature data, approximately 20% of patients had achieved complete histopathological response (pCR) after neoadjuvant chemoradiation therapy. The aim of this study was to evaluate overall survival in rectal cancer patients treated with preoperative chemoradiotherapy and sphincter preserving surgery. Methods. This retrospective study included 191 patients. Patients received preoperative radiation therapy and chemotherapy-chemoradiation therapy (CRT) followed by operation that favorized sphincter preservation with total mesorectal excision (TME) from June 2000 until December 2010. Diagnosis was established according to the following algorithm: patient history, digital rectal examiantion, colonoscopy with biopsy and histopathology verification, and preoperative clinical staging. Patients with tumors located below promontorium were included in the study and patients with metastatic disease and local recurrence were excluded from the study. For tumors located below the promontorium preoperative radiotherapy was used with total dose of 50.4 Gy, divided into daily doses of 1.8 Gy, during 28 days. Chemotherapy followed radiotherapy with 5- fluorouracil and folic acid (Leucovorin) on days 1, 2, 10, 11, 20 and 21. Six to ten weeks after neoadjuvant therapy, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to restage tumors and operation were performed. Results. Of all patients that received preopertive chemoradiation, 163 had radical sphincter preservig surgery and 28 patients had paliative operations. Histopathological examination of the specimens showed that the complete histopathological regression was achieved in 21.4% of the patients, downstaged was found in 63.2% of them and unchanged stage was found in 15.3% of the patients. The five-year survival rate was 63.3% and 50.5 % in the patients with pCR and patients with incomplete histopathological regression, respectively. Survival rates between two groups were not statistically significant (p > 0.05). Conclusion. The preoperative chemoradiotherapy is very important in achieving optimal clinical care for patients with locally advanced rectal cancer.Copyright © 2018, Inst. Sci. inf., Univ. Defence in Belgrade.

2847,"Outcomes and prognostic stratification of patients with recurrent glioblastoma treated with salvage stereotactic radiosurgery OBJECTIVE Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most malignant form of astrocytoma. The average survival is 6-10 months in patients with recurrent GBM (rGBM). In this study, the authors evaluated the role of stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) in patients with rGBMs. METHODS The authors performed a retrospective review of their brain tumor database (1997-2016). Overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) after salvage SRS were the primary endpoints evaluated. Response to SRS was assessed using volumetric MR images. RESULTS Fifty-three patients with rGBM underwent salvage SRS targeting 75 lesions. The median tumor diameter and volume were 2.55 cm and 3.80 cm3, respectively. The median prescription dose was 18 Gy (range 12-24 Gy) and the homogeneity index was 1.90 (range 1.11-2.02). The median OS after salvage SRS was estimated to be 11.0 months (95% CI 7.1-12.2) and the median PFS after salvage SRS was 4.4 months (95% CI 3.7-5.0). A Karnofsky Performance Scale score >= 80 was independently associated with longer OS, while small tumor volume (< 15 cm3) and less homogeneous treatment plans (homogeneity index > 1.75) were both independently associated with longer OS (p = 0.007 and 0.03) and PFS (p = 0.01 and 0.002, respectively). Based on these factors, 2 prognostic groups were identified for PFS (5.4 vs 3.2 months), while 3 were identified for OS (median OS of 15.2 vs 10.5 vs 5.2 months). CONCLUSIONS SRS is associated with longer OS and/or PFS in patients with good performance status, small-volume tumor recurrences, and heterogeneous treatment plans. The authors propose a prognostic model to identify a cohort of rGBM patients who may benefit from SRS.Copyright ©AANS 2019",Excluded
207,"Effects of curcumin based PDT on the viability and the organization of actin in melanotic (A375) and amelanotic melanoma (C32) - in vitro studies Curcumin is a turmeric, antioxidative compound, well-known of its anti-cancer properties. Nowadays more and more effort is made in the field of enhancing the efficiency of the anticancer therapies. Combining the photoactive properties of curcumin with the superficial localization of melanoma and photodynamic therapy (PDT) seems to be a promising treatment method. The research focused on the evaluation of the curcumin effectiveness as an anticancer therapeutic agent in the in vitro treatment of melanotic (A375) and amelanotic (C32) melanoma cell lines. Keratinocytes (HaCat) and fibroblasts (HGF) were used to assess the impact of the therapy on the skin tissue. The aim of the study was to investigate the cell death after exposure to light irradiation after preincubation with curcumin. Additionaly the authors analized the interactions between curcumin and the actin cytoskeleton. The cytotoxic effect initiated by curcumin and increased by irradiation confirm the usefulness of the flavonoid in the PDT approach. Depending on curcumin concentration and incubation time, melanoma cells survival rate ranged from: 93.68 % (C32 cell line, 10 muM, 24 h) and 83.47 % (A375 cell line, 10 muM, 24 h) to 8.98 % (C32 cell line, 50 muM, 48 h) and 12.42 % (A375 cell line, 50 muM, 48 h). Moreover, photodynamic therapy with curcumin increased the number of apoptotic and necrotic cells in comparison to incubation with curcumin without irradiation. The study demonstrated that PDT induced caspase-3 overexpression and DNA cleavage in the studied cell lines. The cells revealed decreased proliferation after the therapy due to the actin cytoskeleton rearrangement. Although effective, the therapy remains not selective towards melanoma cells.

However, the additional radiation exposure is a cause of concern and dose saving strategies should be applied, if possible. To estimate effective dose of retrospective gated and prospective ECG-triggered triple-rule-out computed tomography angiography (TRO-CTA). An Alderson-Rando-phantom equipped with thermoluminescent dosimeters was used for dose measurements. Exposure was performed on a 128-slice single source scanner. The following scan parameters were used (retrospective ECG-gated): 120 kV, 190 mAs/rot., collimation 128x0.6 mm, rotation time 0.3 s. Protocols with a simulated heart rate (HR) of 60 and 100 bpm were performed using the standard ECG-pulsing as well as MinDose. Additionally, a prospective triggered TRO-CTA was acquired (HR 60 bpm). The estimated effective dose of retrospective ECG-gated TRO-CTA ranged from 7.4-13.4 mSv and from 10.1-17.5 mSv for men and women, respectively. Due to radiosensitive breast tissue, women received a significant increased effective dose of up to 64.7% +/- 0.03% (p = 0.028) compared to men. MinDose reduces radiation exposure of up to 33.0% +/- 6.5% in comparison to standard ECG-pulsing (p < 0.001). The effective dose increased significantly with lower heart rates (p < 0.001). Prospective ECG-triggered TRO-CTA showed an effective dose of 5.9 mSv and 8.2 mSv for men and women, respectively. Compared to retrospective ECG-gated TRO-CTA a significant dose reduction was observed (p < 0.001).

1857,"Can we achieve a radionuclide radiation dose equal to or less than that of 99mTc-hydroxymethane diphosphonate bone scintigraphy with a low-dose 18F-sodium fluoride time-of-flight PET of diagnostic quality? PURPOSE: F-Sodium fluoride is a bone tracer with a high signal-to-noise ratio, but its dosimetry is higher than that of Tc-labeled phosphonates at the recommended activities. The study's purpose was to determine whether the reduction by half of F-sodium fluoride-injected activity, mimicked by a short-timed reconstruction image, simulating a total dose less than or equal to that of Tc-hydroxymethane diphosphonate scintigraphy, had an impact on the accuracy of PET semiquantitative measurements and image quality. METHOD(S): Whole-body time-of-flight F-sodium fluoride PET/computed tomography (CT) images were acquired prospectively from 40 adult patients for detection of bone metastases. F-Sodium fluoride was administered according to the European Association of Nuclear Medicine (EANM) and Society of Nuclear Medicine (SNM) practice guidelines. From the acquired 1 min/bed position list-mode data, 30-s reconstructions were extracted. Measurements of maximum standard uptake value were recorded with a region of interest applied to the same location on the 1-min and 30-s images, which were displayed side by side, and were analyzed using Bland-Altman plots. A masked reading was performed by two senior nuclear medicine physicians who counted the foci of visually increased uptake. RESULT(S): Bland-Altman plots showed an excellent agreement between the maximum standard uptake value measurements of the 60- and 30-s images. The paired Wilcoxon test results between the corresponding 60- and 30-s images read by masked readers A and B were not significant (P=0.15 and 0.19, respectively). CONCLUSION(S): Reducing acquisition duration by half or injecting half of the activity recommended by the EANM and SNM practice guidelines can lead to F-sodium fluoride time-of-flight PET images of diagnostic quality, achieving a radiation dose less than or equal to that of Tc-labeled phosphonates.

1579,"Decline of natural killer cell activity in sublethally irradiated mice Spleen cells of (C57BL/6 X C3H/He)F1 mice were assayed for natural killer (NK) cell activity against YAC-1 and FBL-3 lymphoma targets at several intervals after total-body exposure to a high sublethal dose of 137Cs or 60Co gamma-rays. NK cell activity did not decline for the first 12 days but decreased sharply thereafter and remained low until day 24. The recovery of splenic NK cell activity was delayed. Beginning on day 28, the activity was slowly increased, reaching near-normal levels (80% of controls) 41-59 days after irradiation. Suppressor cells detectable during the period of lowest NK cell activity, i.e., on days 17 and 19, may have been responsible for the delayed and slow recovery. These studies indicated that a) mature effectors of natural cytotoxicity are relatively radioresistant renewable cells with a lifespan of about 2 weeks whose progenitors are radiosensitive cells b) the kinetics of decline and especially of recovery of NK cell activity may be influenced by suppressor cells. Should NK cell activity confer resistance to autochthonous lymphomas in vivo, it may be a significant consideration for strategies of tumor therapy by cytotoxic agents that reconstitution of the NK cell pool is a slow process and that suppressor cell function must be overcome for full recovery.",Included
2100,"Squamous cell and basal cell carcinoma of the skin in relation to radiation therapy and potential modification of risk by sun exposure BACKGROUND: Epidemiologic studies consistently find enhanced risk of basal cell carcinoma of the skin among individuals exposed to ionizing radiation, but it is unclear whether the radiation effect occurs for squamous cell carcinoma. It is also not known whether subgroups of individuals are at greater risk, eg, those with radiation sensitivity or high ultraviolet radiation exposure., METHODS: We analyzed data from a case-control study of keratinocyte cancers in New Hampshire. Incident cases diagnosed in 1993-1995 and 1997-2000 were identified through a state-wide skin cancer surveillance system, and controls were identified through the Department of Transportation and Center for Medicare and Medicaid Service Files (n = 1121 basal cell carcinoma cases, 854 squamous cell carcinoma cases, and 1049 controls)., RESULTS: We found an association between history of radiation treatment and basal cell carcinoma. The association was especially strong for basal cell carcinomas arising within the radiation treatment field (odds ratio = 2.6; 95% confidence interval = 1.5-4.3), and among those treated with radiation therapy before age 20 (3.4; 1.8-6.4), those whose basal cell carcinomas occurred 40 or more years after radiation treatment (3.2; 1.8-5.8), and those treated with radiation for acne (11; 2.7-49). Similar age and time patterns of risk were observed for squamous cell carcinoma, although generally with smaller odds ratios. For basal cell carcinoma, early exposure to radiation treatment was a risk factor largely among those without a history of severe sunburns, whereas for squamous cell carcinoma, radiation treatment was a risk factor primarily among those with a sun-sensitive skin type (ie, a tendency to sunburn)., CONCLUSIONS: Radiation treatment, particularly if experienced before age 20, seems to increase the long-term risk of both basal and squamous cell carcinomas of the skin.

As reference, 390 participants with regular heart rates <=65 bpm were used. All participants underwent prospectively electrocardiographically(ECG)-triggered imaging of the coronary arteries using dual source CT at 120kVp, 80 ref mAs using both high-pitch spiral mode and sequential mode. Radiation dose, Agatston score, number of positive scores, as well as median absolute difference of the Agatston score were determined and participants were stratified into CVD risk categories., RESULTS: A similar percentage of participants with low heart rates and high heart rates had a positive CAC score in data sets acquired in high-pitch spiral (low heart rate: 57.7%, high heart rate: 55.8%) and sequential mode (58.0%, 54.7%, p=n.s.). The median absolute difference in Agatston scores between acquisition modes was 14.2% and 9.2%, for the high and low heart rate groups, respectively. Excellent agreement for risk categorization between the two data acquisition modes was found for the high (kappa=0.927) and low (kappa=0.946) heart rate groups. Radiation dose was 48% lower for high-pitch spiral versus sequential acquisitions., CONCLUSION: Radiation dose for the quantification of coronary calcium can be reduced by 48% when using the high-pitch spiral acquisition mode compared to the sequential mode in participants with a regular high heart rate.

2617,"Time sequence of cancer occurrence. Implications in low level radiation risk assessment A total of 8 229 C57 Black mice of both sexes were randomly assigned to various groups. In some groups, mice aged 33 +/- 3 days were submitted to either sham, neutron or cobalt external radiation at 32, 45, 63, 88 and 123 mGy or at 18, 25, 36 and 51 cGy dose levels, respectively. In other groups, mice either at birth or weaning, were injected with tritiated thymidine or tritiated water, or were given tritiated water as drinking water for the entire lifespan. The main purpose of the experiment was to investigate the low dose-response relationship of cancer induction, especially leukemogenesis and to evaluate the excess risk, using actuarial age-specific rates. Following neutron or cobalt exposure, the phenotypic occurrence of lymphocytic lymphomas was earlier in appearance and higher in yield during the first decades of lifespan in irradiated groups versus matching controls, whereas such occurrence was markedly lower in yield at a later age. Under parallel experimental conditions, induction of reticulum cell lymphomas, however, was uniformly enhanced throughout the entire lifespan. Induction rates of all tumors (reticular and solid) pooled were significantly increased, and more so following cobalt than neutron irradiation. In mice injected with tritiated thymidine, the overall tumor incidence was increased monotonically throughout the lifespan. In mice exposed to tritiated water, the incidence of lymphocytic lymphomas was markedly increased throughout the lifespan, whereas no such effect was observed for reticulum cell tumors. In the light of tumor data analysis, it appears that selection of a particular type of tumor as a dependent variable for dose-response assessment cannot disregard the primary modulation of the whole tumor spectrum. In C57 Black murine leukemogenesis, the shape and structure of the dose-response regression curve over the entire lifespan does not fit the linear-quadratic model. It is, however, theorized that our data are consistent with the two-mutation clonal expansion model, assuming creation of initiated cells which are added to the pool of spontaneously occurring initiated cells and implying that the excess risk is initially high at early age and then decreases with increasing age following exposure. It is concluded that murine radiocarcinogenesis investigation may contribute to improving the assessment as well as understanding the underlying mechanisms of low level radiation hazards.

The 3- and 5-year survival rates were 51% (95% confidence interval [CI], 36-65%) and 32% (95% CI, 17-47%), respectively. By multivariate analysis, age (<60 vs. >=60 years) was the only statistically significant prognostic factor; the WBRT dose, sex, and number of tumors were not significant prognostic factors in this study. Myelosuppression was the most frequent side effect, 60% of patients experienced grade 3-4 leukopenia. Late neurotoxicity as a result of treatment was observed in 14 of 43 patients (34%) and higher age (>60) was associated with a high risk of neurotoxicity. Conclusion. The intra-arterial administration of ACNU combined with radiation therapy yielded a high response rate at acceptable toxicity levels in younger patients with PCNSL. However, late neurotoxicity was a serious complication in patients above 60 years of age. © 2007 Springer-Verlag.",Excluded
2859,"Intensity-modulated radiotherapy versus three-dimensional conformal radiotherapy for stage I-II natural killer/T-cell lymphoma nasal type: Dosimetric and clinical results Background: This study was to compare radiotherapy treatment planning and treatment outcomes following three-dimensional conformal radiotherapy (3DCRT) and intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) in stage I-II natural killer (NK)/T-cell lymphoma. Method(s): The cases of 94 patients with stage I-II NK/T-cell lymphoma, nasal type in the upper aerodigestive tract who treated between May 2005 and Dec 2008 were reviewed. These patients received radiotherapy with or without induction chemotherapy. Definitive radiotherapy was conducted using 3DCRT in 47 patients and IMRT in the other 47 patients with a regional field and a total dose of 50 Gy. Dosimetric pmeters of radiation treatment plans, local control probability (LCP), overall survival (OS), and toxicities were analyzed and compared between 3DCRT and IMRT. Result(s): From the dosimetric analysis, IMRT demonstrated significantly better dose coverage and homogeneity than 3DCRT. However, after a median follow-up of 46 months, IMRT was not associated with improvements in 4y-OS (80.9% for 3DCRT vs. 82.7% for IMRT, p=0.87) or 4y-LCP (86.3% for 3DCRT vs. 88.9% for IMR p=0.85). Of the 18 patients who received cervical lymph node irradiation, those in the IMRT group received a lower mean parotid dose. Furthermore, at-risk organs were strictly kept within the safe dose range in both groups, and no severe late toxicity was observed. Conclusion(s): IMRT provided better dose coverage than 3DCRT, although it failed to provide LCP and OS benefits. Definitive radiotherapy with a regional field and a total dose of 50 Gy is efficient and safe for NK/T-cell lymphoma using either IMRT or 3DCRT. However, IMRT may have the potential to reduce parotid gland hypofunction following cervical irradiation. © 2013 Shen et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",Excluded
288,"Patient effective radiation dose and associated risk from transmission scans using 153Gd line sources in cardiac SPECT studies The aim of the present study was to determine the contribution of transmission measurements acquisition to total patient effective dose from cardiac SPECT studies. A dual-head L-shaped gamma camera equipped with a transmission scan acquisition system based on two 153Gd line sources was used to simulate transmission measurements acquisition exposure on an anthropomorphic phantom. Thermoluminescence dosimeters were used to directly monitor the dose to 550 measuring points in the phantom. The effective dose and associated risk from transmission scans acquisition were estimated and compared to those associated to the radiopharmaceutical injected. The maximum effective dose from a typical transmission measurements acquisition was 1.3 muSv and 1.9 muSv for male and female patients, respectively. The contribution of the typical transmission scans acquisition to total patient radiation risk from a cardiac SPECT study is less than 10-3. Thus, radiation exposure may not be considered as a limiting factor for the clinical application of attenuation correction methods based on transmission measurements in cardiac SPECT.",Excluded
1866,"The effect of electromagnetic field emitted by a mobile phone on the inhibitory control of saccades OBJECTIVE: To investigate whether exposure to a pulsed high-frequency electromagnetic field (pulsed EMF) emitted by a mobile phone has short-term effects on the inhibitory control of saccades., METHODS: A double-blind, counterbalanced crossover study design was employed. We assessed the performance of 10 normal subjects on antisaccade (AS) and cued saccade (CUED) tasks as well as two types of overlap saccade (OL1, OL2) task before and after 30 min of exposure to EMF emitted by a mobile phone or sham exposure., RESULTS: After EMF or sham exposure, we observed a slight but significant shortening of latency in the CUED and OL2 tasks. AS amplitude decreased as well as the saccade velocities in the AS, CUED, and OL1 tasks after exposure. These changes occurred regardless of whether exposure was real or sham. The frequencies of pro-saccades in the AS task, saccades to cue in the CUED task, and prematurely initiated saccades in the overlap (OL2) task did not change significantly after real or sham EMF exposure., CONCLUSIONS: Thirty minutes of mobile phone exposure has no significant short-term effect on the inhibitory control of saccades., SIGNIFICANCE: The cortical processing responsible for saccade inhibition is not affected by exposure to EMF emitted by a mobile phone.

1362,"Comparative stochastic effects of inhaled alpha- and beta-particle- emitting radionuclides in beagle dogs The stochastic effects of inhaled, insoluble particles of alpha- or beta- particle-emitting radionuclides were compared in dogs. Male and female beagle dogs were exposed briefly by nasal inhalation to relatively insoluble aerosols of 239PuO2 or 144Ce in fused aluminosilicate particles (FAP) and observed for cancer for their lifetimes. The initial lung burden and retention of each radionuclide was determined by whole-body counting of the emissions from 144Ce-144Pr- or 169Yb-labeled 239PuO2. Lung doses were calculated for each dog from these data. The lung doses ranged from 0.21 to 1200 Gy for 144Ce FAP and 1.6 to 58 Gy for 239PuO2. Dogs with doses to the lung of about 60 Gy or greater from 144Ce or about 2 Gy or greater from 239PuO2 had an increased incidence of lung carcinomas. In dogs exposed to 144Ce FAP, three organs were targets for neoplasia: lung, tracheobronchial lymph nodes, and heart. The insoluble FAP carried to the lymph nodes draining the lung delivered high radiation doses to the nodes and adjacent heart, resulting in hemangiosarcomas of these organs. In the lung, high radiation doses induced hemangiosarcomas and carcinosarcomas. At lower doses, carcinomas of various histological patterns were induced in the lung. In dogs exposed to 239PuO2, the lung was the sole target organ for neoplasia. Nearly all of these neoplasms were carcinomas of various histological patterns. These results indicated that relatively low doses of alpha-particle radiation can induce pulmonary cancers, but relatively large doses of beta-particle radiation are required. In addition, inhaled beta-particle emitters can also induce cancers in lung-associated lymph nodes and heart at these larger absorbed radiation doses.",Included
557,"[Influence of Professional Contact with Plutonium-239 on Indicators of the Immune Status of the Personnel at Siberian Chemical Plant] The results of the examination and monitoring of the personnel at the Siberian Chemical Plant (SChP) and adult population of Seversk are presented. The results of primary examination of the personnel who professionally contact the ionizing radiation (IR) from external sources and incorporated 239Pu showed that clinical symptoms of dysfunction of the immune system manifested themselves with a frequency of 75.30%. Infectious-inflammatory diseases (46.95%) and the combined pathology of infectious and allergic character (20.12%) were the most widespread. The allergic diseases (AD) without manifestations of an infectious component were observed not often (7.62%). The monitoring which was carried out for 10 years revealed a decrease in a percentage of persons with clinical signs of disorders of the immune system up to 60.68% among the personnel at the Chemical-Steel Plant and even more among the whole group of the studied personnel at SChP--49.68% (389 : 783). Among the population their frequency made up 51.78%. Features of clinical manifestations of dysfunction ofthe immune system depending on accumulation of 239Pu in the organism are established. Similar dynamics of infectious and infectious and allergic syndromes is revealed when the activity of 239Pu is 40 nCi. AD frequency reliably increased .when the activity of 239Pu is 20 nCi, but if accumulation is higher than 20-40 nCi it decreases and again increases when the activity is over 40 nCi. Pathologies of infectious and allergic genesis are most often observed when the content of 239Pu in an organism is over 40 nCi. Indicators of the immune status (IS) of the personnel at SChP with incorporated 239Pu are analyzed. 59 people--carriers of 239Pu and 408 people without 239Pu accumulated in an organism are examined. In comparison with the control, IS indicators characteristic for all dose loading groups are revealed: increase of lymphocytes, existence of dissociation in indicators of relative and absolute values of the T-cellular link, CD16+56+(-) NK-cells and B-lymphocytes with increase of absolute values, decrease in markers of activation of HLA-DR+ and CD95+, increase of B-lymphocytes and low level of serum IgM. Features of IS in comparison with the group of the personnel with the absence of 239Pu in an organism and indicators of IS which depend on the activity of 239Pu are established. Among them are a decrease in the percentage of persons with increased number of lymphocytes with increased beam loading; increase of NK-T-cells when the activity of 239Pu is 10-20 nCi and the highest value at doses over40 nCi; the dynamics of CD16+56(+)-lymphocytes with the increase of the contents and a percentage of persons with the increase of the activity above 40 nCi; the highest frequenc of a regulatory imbalance with high frequency decrease of CD8(+)-T-lymphocytes at the content of 239Pu > 0-10 nCi; decrease in indicators of B-lymphocytes and serum IgA with an increase in the activity of 239Pu with the lowest values under internal radiation over 40 nCi; decrease in the percentage of persons with a weakening expression of HLA-DR+ with the increase in dose loading.",Included
2481,"Concentrated adipose tissue infusion for the treatment of knee osteoarthritis: clinical and histological observations Purpose: Osteoarthritis (OA) is characterized by articular cartilage degeneration and subchondral bone sclerosis. OA can benefit of non-surgical treatments with collagenase-isolated stromal vascular fraction (SVF) or cultured-expanded mesenchymal stem cells (ASCs). To avoid high manipulation of the lipoaspirate needed to obtain ASCs and SVF, we investigated whether articular infusions of autologous concentrated adipose tissue are an effective treatment for knee OA patients. Method(s): The knee of 20 OA patients was intra-articularly injected with autologous concentrated adipose tissue, obtained after centrifugation of lipoaspirate. Patients' articular functionality and pain were evaluated by VAS and WOMAC scores at three, six and 18 months from infusion. The osteogenic and chondrogenic ability of ASCs contained in the injected adipose tissue was studied in in vitro primary osteoblast and chondrocyte cell cultures, also plated on 3D-bone scaffold. Knee articular biopsies of patients previously treated with adipose tissue were analyzed. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) were performed to detect cell differentiation and tissue regeneration. Result(s): The treatment resulted safe, and all patients reported an improvement in terms of pain reduction and increase of function. According to the osteogenic or chondrogenic stimulation, ASCs expressed alkaline phosphatase or aggrecan, respectively. The presence of a layer of newly formed tissue was visualized by IHC staining and SEM. The biopsy of previously treated knee joints showed new tissue formation, starting from the bone side of the osteochondral lesion. Conclusion(s): Overall our data indicate that adipose tissue infusion stimulates tissue regeneration and might be considered a safe treatment for knee OA.Copyright © 2018, SICOT aisbl.",Excluded

2310,"Toxicities Following Stereotactic Ablative Radiotherapy Treatment of Locally-Recurrent and Previously Irradiated Head and Neck Squamous Cell Carcinoma Stereotactic ablative radiotherapy (SABR) with concomitant cetuximab is an effective treatment option for previously irradiated, locally recurrent squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck. Its local control and overall survival are similar to those of other available treatment options. Each retreatment depends heavily on the prior treatment and every patient is a special case. Based on the experience of our institution and previously published studies, for patients who receive concomitant cetuximab with a median prior radiation therapy dose of 70Gy, we recommend a total dose of 40-44Gy delivered in 5 fractions on alternating days over 1-2 weeks. However, Grade 2 or 3 toxicities are not uncommon. Therefore, in this review, we also report a pilot study that applies a normal tissue complication probability dose-response model to estimate the probability of toxicities in locally recurrent squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck reirradiated with SABR. Although this dose-response model includes concurrent targeted therapy and no comparable model yet exists for SABR without it, complication rates without concurrent biological therapy or chemotherapy should be no higher than those described here.

We used low frequency repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) to study the cognitive and neural systems involved in the control of smooth pursuit eye movements. Eighteen participants were tested on two separate occasions. On each occasion we measured smooth pursuit eye tracking before and after 6 min of 1 Hz rTMS delivered at 90% of motor threshold. Low frequency rTMS over the posterior parietal cortex led to a significant reduction in smooth pursuit velocity gain, whereas rTMS over the motor cortex had no effect on gain. We conclude that low frequency offline rTMS is a potentially useful tool with which to explore the cortical systems involved in oculomotor control.",Excluded

We then tested such system on bedside CXRs of an independent group of 110 patients (74 COVID-19, 36 non-COVID-19) from one of the two hospitals. A retrospective reading was performed by two radiologists in the absence of any clinical information, with the aim to differentiate COVID-19 from non-COVID-19 patients. Real-time polymerase chain reaction served as the reference standard., RESULTS: At 10-fold cross-validation, our deep learning model classified COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 patients with 0.78 sensitivity (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.74-0.81), 0.82 specificity (95% CI 0.78-0.85), and 0.89 area under the curve (AUC) (95% CI 0.86-0.91). For the independent dataset, deep learning showed 0.80 sensitivity (95% CI 0.72-0.86) (59/74), 0.81 specificity (29/36) (95% CI 0.73-0.87), and 0.81 AUC (95% CI 0.73-0.87).

438,"Hippocampal avoidance with volumetric modulated arc therapy in melanoma brain metastases - the first Australian experience PURPOSE: Volumetric modulated arc therapy (VMAT) can deliver intensity modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) like dose distributions in a short time; this allows the expansion of IMRT treatments to palliative situations like brain metastases (BMs). VMAT can deliver whole brain radiotherapy (WBRT) with hippocampal avoidance and a simultaneous integrated boost (SIB) to achieve stereotactic radiotherapy (SRT) for BMs. This study is an audit of our experience in the treatment of brain metastases with VMAT in our institution., METHODS AND MATERIALS: Metastases were volumetrically contoured on fused diagnostic gadolinium enhanced T1 weighted MRI/planning CT images. Risk organs included hippocampus, optic nerve, optic chiasm, eye, and brain stem. The hippocampi were contoured manually as one paired organ with assistance from a neuroradiologist. WBRT and SIB were integrated into a single plan., RESULTS: Thirty patients with 73 BMs were treated between March 2010 and February 2012 with VMAT. Mean follow up time was 3.5 months. For 26 patients, BMs arose from primary melanoma and for the remaining four patients from non-small cell lung cancer (n= 2), primary breast cancer, and sarcoma. Mean age was 60 years. The male to female ratio was 2:1. Five patients were treated without hippocampal avoidance (HA) intent. The median WBRT dose was 31 Gy with a median SIB dose for BMs of 50 Gy, given over a median of 15 fractions. Mean values for BMs were as follows: GTV = 6.9 cc, PTV = 13.3 cc, conformity index = 8.6, homogeneity index = 1.06. Mean and maximum hippocampus dose was 20.4 Gy, and 32.4 Gy, respectively, in patients treated with HA intent. Mean VMAT treatment time from beam on to beam off for one fraction was 3.43 minutes, which compared to WBRT time of 1.3 minutes. Twenty out of 25 assessable lesions at the time of analysis were controlled. Treatment was well tolerated; grade 4 toxicity was reported in one patient. The median overall survival was 9.40 months, CONCLUSIONS: VMAT for BMs is feasible, safe and associated with a similar survival times and toxicities to conventional SRT+/-WBRT. The advantage of VMAT is that WBRT and SRT can be delivered at the same time on one machine.",Excluded
2901,"[Intraoperative radiotherapy in abdominal-pelvic cancer surgery] Intraoperative radiotherapy consists in the irradiation of the affected area, exposed using anesthesiological and laparotomic procedures, following the removal of a neoplasia using palliative or macroscopically radical surgical. This increases local tumour control and augments the selectivity of treatment between healthy and neoplastic tissues, thus obtaining a marked improvement in survival or palliation. The authors analyse the data reported in international literature regarding the possible use of intraoperative radiotherapy in patients undergoing abdomino-pelvic oncological surgery. The aim of the study was to evaluate this method for use in selected and combined treatment in which surgery represents an obligatory step. Studies were carried out in a few highly specialised centres given that special technical, logistic and professional skills were required. The populations studied were often very small with a marked prevalence of feasibility studies compared to random studies. In spite of this intraoperative radiotherapy is undoubtedly indicated in locally advanced gastric, rectal and vesical neoplasia, it represents a valid palliative solution in pancreatic neoplasia and in pelvic recidivation, and an effective alternative solution to mutilating surgery in the initial stages of vesical cancer. Positive results are obtained in prostate and uterine cancer, but they are reported by non-conclusive studies. Toxicity is acceptable and non-limiting within a given range of doses and irradiated volume. The ""repercussion"" in terms of knowledge, experience, scientific integration between oncological surgeons and radiotherapists is basic, with a marked improved in the management of cancer treatment.",Excluded
1209,"Definitive Management of Presumed Synchronous Early Stage Non-Small Cell Lung Cancers: Outcomes and Utility of Stereotactic Ablative Radiation Therapy Purpose: Management of synchronous early-stage non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) remains controversial because resection is not always feasible. This study evaluates efficacy and patterns of failure after SABR for synchronous early-stage NSCLC. Methods and Materials: From 2005 to 2015, patients presenting with >=2 synchronous NSCLC tumors (T1a-T2b) and receiving SABR to >=1 lesion were reviewed. The most common prescriptions were 50 Gy in 4 or 70 Gy in 10 fractions. Patients underwent multidisciplinary management with workup including chest computed tomography and positron emission tomography/computed tomography, plus brain imaging and endoscopic bronchial ultrasound for most patients to rule out mediastinal and distant disease. Synchronous lesions were defined as multiple ipsilateral or contralateral intrapulmonary lesions diagnosed within 6 months. Result(s): Of 912 patients treated with SABR for early-stage NSCLC at our institution, 82 (9%) presented with synchronous disease, with a total of 169 lesions. SABR was delivered to 142 lesions (84%), with 57 patients (69.5%) receiving SABR for all sites. Median overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) were 5.1 and 2.7 years, respectively. At a median follow-up of 58 months, OS was 67% and 52% at 3 and 5 years, and corresponding PFS was 47% and 29%. Thirty-nine patients (48%) had progression, with 21 (26%) experiencing distant failure, and intralobar recurrence was among the first failure for 15 patients (18%). Of the 142 SABR-treated sites, these included 6 in-field (4%) and 4 marginal (3%) recurrences. There were no grade >=3 adverse events. Among patients receiving SABR for all sites, there were no differences in OS (P = .946), PFS (P = .980), local control (P = .683), regional and distant control (P = .656), or toxicity (P = .791). On multivariable analysis, ipsilateral synchronous disease was associated with greater regional and distant failure (hazard ratio, 2.691; P = .025). Conclusion(s): Synchronous NSCLC can be managed with definitive local therapy. With high control rates and favorable outcomes, SABR is an effective and feasible treatment for synchronous early-stage NSCLC.Copyright © 2020 Elsevier Inc.",Excluded

We investigated their use as potential biomarkers to identify individuals exposed to ionizing radiation. We collected exfoliated oral epithelial cell samples from 100 healthy individuals undergoing routine dental radiographic examination (2.34 cGy) both before and after the radiograph using a non-invasive technique. The expression levels of pChk2 and gamma-H2AX in oral cells were assessed by immunohistochemical assay. Both biomarkers showed statistically significant increases in levels of expression after the radiation exposure (P < 0.001). This suggests that pChk2 and gamma-H2AX may serve as sensitive indicators of low-dose radiation exposure.",Included
630,"Exposure of patients to low doses of X-radiation during neuro-interventional imaging and procedures: Dose estimation and analysis of gamma-H2AX foci and gene expression in blood lymphocytes Radiation has widespread applications in medicine. However, despite the benefits of medical radiation exposures, adverse long-term health effects are cause for concern. Protein and gene biomarkers are early indicators of cellular response after low-dose exposure. We examined DNA damage by quantifying gamma-H2AX foci and expression of twelve candidate genes in the blood lymphocytes of patients exposed to low doses of X-radiation during neuro-interventional procedures. Entrance surface dose (ESD; 10.92-1062.55 mGy) was measured by thermoluminescence dosimetry (TLD). Absorbed dose was estimated using gamma-H2AX focus frequency and gene expression, with in vitro dose-response curves generated for the same biomarkers. gamma-H2AX foci in post-exposure samples were significantly higher than in pre-exposure samples. Among the genes analysed, FDXR, ATM, BCL2, MDM2, TNFSF9, and PCNA showed increased expression; CDKN1A, DDB2, SESN1, BAX, and TNFRSF10B showed unchanged or decreased expression. Absorbed dose, estimated based on gamma-H2AX focus frequency and gene expression changes, did not show any correlation with measured ESD. Patients undergoing interventional procedures receive considerable radiation doses, resulting in DNA damage and altered gene expression. Medical procedures should be carried out using the lowest radiation doses possible without compromising treatment. Copyright © 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",Excluded
1749,"Growth factor treatment prior to low-dose total body irradiation increases donor cell engraftment after bone marrow transplantation in mice Low-toxicity conditioning regimens prior to bone marrow transplantation (BMT) are widely explored. We developed a new protocol using hematopoietic growth factors prior to low-dose total body irradiation (TBI) in recipients of autologous transplants to establish high levels of long-term donor cell engraftment. We hypothesized that treatment of recipient mice with growth factors would selectively deplete stem cells, resulting in successful long-term donor cell engraftment after transplantation. Recipient mice were treated for 1 or 7 days with growth factors (stem cell factor [SCF] plus interleukin 11 [IL-11], SCF plus Flt-3 ligand [FL], or granulocyte colony-stimulating factor [G-CSF]) prior to low-dose TBI (4 Gy). Donor cell chimerism was measured after transplantation of congenic bone marrow cells. High levels of donor cell engraftment were observed in recipients pretreated for 7 days with SCF plus IL-11 or SCF plus FL. Although 1-day pretreatments with these cytokines initially resulted in reduced donor cell engraftment, a continuous increase in time was observed, finally resulting in highly significantly increased levels of donor cell contribution. In contrast, G-CSF treatment showed no beneficial effects on long-term engraftment. In vitro stem cell assays demonstrated the effect of cytokine treatment on stem cell numbers. Donor cell engraftment and number of remaining recipient stem cells after TBI were strongly inversely correlated, except for groups treated for 1 day with SCF plus IL-11 or SCF plus FL. We conclude that long-term donor cell engraftment can be strongly augmented by treatment of recipient mice prior to low-dose TBI with hematopoietic growth factors that act on primitive cells.",Excluded

NTCP mean values for RTOG grade 01 and 23 were respectively 4% (95% CI 25.9%) and 37% (95% CI 11.662.3%). Univariate analysis, performed with t-Student test, showed a statistically significant difference between MLD2 values in the two groups (t = 5.93 and p <= 0.001). Logistic regression analysis showed a good correlation between MLD2 and toxicity scores 23 (p = 0.008, odds ratio 1.5). From logistic regression relationship between the observed rates of grade 23 and MLD2, a D50=19.8 Gy and a 50=2.2 were obtained. From the sigmoid-shaped dose-response relationship between NTCP and MLD2, a D50=22.4 Gy and 50=2.2 were derived. Discussion. MLD2 is strongly associated to the risk of lung injury. Higher NTCP values are associated with a higher risk, but when comparing the expected to the observed toxicity rate, NTCP seems to underestimate the risk.",Excluded
2328,"A rare complication after shoulder arthroplasty, Radial Nerve Palsy: A case report INTRODUCTION: Shoulder arthroplasty modernized by Neer and al for proximal humerus fracture has shown excellent outcome.1 Despite its clinical success, complications do occur. Neurological injury is a rare complication with an estimated incidence 1% to 4%.2 Here we would like to report an uncommon complication of radial nerve palsy hence to discuss the possible causes and preventive measures. CASE REPORT: Mr X, a 50 year old gentleman, right hand dominant who works an office clerk, presented with a 4 parts fracture of proximal right humerus with anterior shoulder following a motor-vehicle accident (Figure 1). He underwent a shoulder hemiarthroplasty 2 weeks post-trauma. Procedure was performed under interscalene regional block with a standard delto-pectoral approach. The displaced humeral head button hole into pectoralis major muscle was removed carefully under direct visualization. No complication occurred intra-operatively. Shoulder x-ray showed a well-placed, cemented humeral stem arthroplasty (Figure 2). On post-operative evaluation, patient had clinical evidence of complete radial nerve palsy; where else other peripheral nerves were intact. This initially attributed to the residual effects of interscalene block. However on discharge post-operative day 5, there was no improvement. DISCUSSION: Complications related to shoulder implant arthroplasty are well documented. Incidence of complications approached 14%.3 These include instability, rotator cuff tear, ectopic ossification, glenoid loosening, intraoperative fracture, nerve injury, infection and humeral loosening. No vascular injury was reported. Most cases of nerve injury are neuropraxia involving the axillary nerve, musculocutaneous nerve, median and ulnar nerves.3 Age, sex, height, weight, preoperative diagnosis, and coexistant rotator cuff disease were not statistically significant risk factors.2 We believe that tractional injury on the brachial plexus during surgery is likely mechanism of injury. Placing the shoulder in excessive abduction, extension and external rotation for prolonged period of time especially during removal of the humeral head from the pectoralis major muscle may have caused tractional injury to the posterior cord. (Figure Parsented) CONCLUSION(S): Although neurovascular injury after shoulder replacement surgery is rare, its occurrence could lead to significant impairment. Knowledge of shoulder anatomy, meticulous surgical technique and proper positioning and traction can decrease the chance of occurrence of this injury. Patient education regarding this injury should be advocated.",Excluded
2682,"Transanal minimally-invasive surgery for treating patients with regressed rectal cancer after preoperative chemoradiotherapy Purpose: Although the standard treatment for patients with locally advanced rectal cancer managed by preoperative chemoradiotherapy (CRT) is a radical resection, local excisions are used in highly-selective cases. Recently, transanal minimally-invasive surgery (TAMIS) has emerged as a feasible technique for local excision of midrectal lesions. We assess the feasibility of using TAMIS to treat patients with locally advanced rectal cancer who showed good response to CRT. Method(s): From October 2010 to June 2013, 35 consecutive patients with rectal cancer managed by using preoperative CRT underwent TAMIS. After a single-incision laparoscopic surgery port had been introduced into the anal canal, a fullthickness local excision with conventional laparoscopic instruments was performed. We retrospectively reviewed a prospectively collected database of these cases. Result(s): Of the 35 patients analyzed, 18 showed pathologic complete responses and 17 had residual lesions (2 ypTis, 4 ypT1, 9 ypT2, and 2 ypT3); 34 (97.1%) showed clear deep, lateral margins. The median distance of lesions from the anal verge was 5 cm. All procedures were completed laparoscopically, and the median operating time was 84 minutes. No intraoperative events or morbidities were seen in any of the patients, except one with wound dehiscence, who was treated conservatively. The median postoperative hospital stay and follow-up period were 4 days and 36 months, respectively. During the study period, no patients died, but 5 (14.3%) experienced recurrence, including one recurrence at the TAMIS site. Conclusion(s): TAMIS seems to be a feasible, safe modality for treating patients with locally advanced rectal cancer who show good response to preoperative CRT.Copyright © 2017 The Korean Society of Coloproctology.",Excluded
3075,"Mortality Analysis of the Life Span Study (LSS) Cohort Taking into Account Multiple Causes of Death Indicated in Death Certificates Mortality analyses have been performed using underlying causes of death as reported on death certificates; these are uniquely determined for a deceased person according to the World Health Organization coding system. Comorbidities, the disease conditions other than the underlying cause of death from death certificates recording multiple causes of death, have rarely been explored in Life Span Study subjects. The purpose of this study was to clarify associations between atomic bomb radiation exposure and mortality from combinations of the underlying cause of death and comorbidities. The focused follow-up period was 1977-2003, prior to which death certificate accuracy was unreliable. The study cohort was comprised of 10,017 people for whom the category ""all circulatory disease"" was listed as the underlying cause of death, of which heart disease (rheumatic, hypertensive and ischemic heart disease) and stroke were major subtypes. Comorbidities considered were pneumonia, renal disease, diabetes mellitus, cancer and the major circulatory disease subtypes listed above. Poisson regression models were used for analyses. Excess relative risks (ERRs) for mortality at 1 Gy were significantly increased when cancer was comorbid with all circulatory disease, heart disease, ischemic heart disease or stroke, ranging from 0.61 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.13, 1.41; N = 177 for all circulatory diseases to 1.60 (CI: 0.07, 4.86; N = 42) for ischemic heart disease. Among the other comorbidities, only diabetes comorbid with heart disease had a significant radiation dose response (ERR at 1 Gy of 0.62, CI: 0.10, 1.46; N = 128). It remains uncertain if the high ERRs with comorbid cancers were anomalous due to the small number of cases or some dissimilarity in statistical methodologies, or if this might suggest some pathogenetic basis for increased fatality. For this reason, further investigation is required.Copyright © 2017 by Radiation Research Society.",Excluded

2913,"Lhermitte's sign following head and neck radiotherapy Lhermitte's sign is an uncommon sequel of radiotherapy to the cervical spinal cord. Although the exact mechanism underlying its occurrence remains unclear; it is felt to be the result of a temporary interference with the turnover and synthesis of myelin, leading to focal demyelination. We have undertaken a detailed analysis of the radiation delivered to four patients who developed the sign after irradiation for malignancies of the head and neck. Our data support the view that radiation dose is crucial to its development, but calculations using the linear-quadratic radiobiological model raise interesting questions regarding the dose-response relationship. In particular, we find that calculations of biologically effective doses are predictive of a late rather than an early normal tissue response. The onset of symptoms after irradiation was apparent in all four patients within 4 months, with resolution in all being complete within a further 6 months: The recognition of this benign transient form of radiation-induced paraesthesia and its differentiation from the later onset, progressive and unremitting symptoms associated with radiation myelopathy is essential in reassuring patients undergoing head and neck irradiation.",Excluded

1563,"[Reliability of the diagnostic results obtained with confined quantities of the contrast medium in endolymphatic radionuclide therapy (ELRT) of the inferior limbs (author's transl)] Endolymphatic radionuclide therapy (ELRT) produces not only a radiotherapeutic effect on the lymph nodes but makes possible also to judge of the lymph nodes being stained with labelled lipiodol UF. With the purpose of avoiding an eventual radiation exposure of the lung, or at least of confining it to a minimum, only limited quantities not exceeding 3.5 ml (5 mCi of 32P; 0.5 mCi of 131I) of the oily contrast medium for unilateral, or twice 3.5 ml (together 4 mCi of 32P; 0.5 mCi of 131I) for bilateral application. A retrospective analysis of 245 patients of the study group for endolymphatic radionuclide therapy, who suffered from malignant melanomas of the inferior limbs, revealed 77.5% of correct diagnoses. Most of the false-positive findings (44/70) seem to be due to the knowledge of the primary disease, as 77% of these cases had been described as ""suspicious"". False-negative findings turned out in 5% only. The findings which had been characterized as ""surely positive"" proved reliable in 90%.

2544,"Dynamic magnetic resonance of pelvic floor in the diagnosis of pelvic floor dysfunctions Aim: Dynamic magnetic resonance imaging of the pelvic floor (DMRPF) is a complementary diagnostic tool allowing dynamic and/or static assessment of all compartments of the pelvis (anterior, middle and posterior) in a single study. Method(s): We present a prospective and consecutive series of 288 patients evaluated between April 2005 and November 2013 undergoing DMRPF. Of the total patient number, 10 (3.47%) were male. Result(s): Due to the coexistence of pathology in different parts of the pelvic floor - more often in women - diagnostic confirmation is necessary so that the appropriate treatments can be accomplished in one single surgical approach. Outlet obstruction syndrome (OOS) was present in 262 patients. In 239 (82.4%) patients, an anterior rectocele was confirmed. In 55 (23%) of these cases, an anterior retrocele was the only finding. In 207 patients, other abdomino-pelvic anatomical dislocations were found that had not been clinically suspected or detected during physical examination. Conclusion(s): DMRPF is a study that does not expose patients to ionizing radiation providing dynamic interactive anatomical and functional data at rest and during provocative manoeuvers. Multi-plane imaging provides a clear view of the organs in the pelvis and the pelvic floor muscles which is not always accurately detected on physical examination. Currently, DMRPF is the recommended study designed to evaluate pelvic floor dysfunction as it can be used to confirm presumptive diagnoses and to quantify the impact of the dislocation of pelvic floor viscera, to define intestinal emptying dynamics, and to outline inadequate relaxation of the puborectalis during straining and simulated evacuation.",Excluded
649,"Pre-apoptotic response to therapeutic DNA damage involves protein modulation of Mcl-1, Hdm2 and Flt3 in acute myeloid leukemia cells Background: Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cells are characterized by non-mutated TP53, high levels of Hdm2, and frequent mutation of the Flt3 receptor tyrosine kinase. The juxtamembrane mutation of FLT3 is the strongest independent marker for disease relapse and is associated with elevated Bcl-2 protein and p53 hyper-phosphorylation in AML. DNA damage forms the basic mechanism of cancer cell eradication in current therapy of AML. Hdm2 and pro-apoptotic Bcl-2 members are among the most intensely induced genes immediately after chemotherapy and Hdm2 is proposed a role in receptor tyrosine kinase regulation. Thus we examined the DNA damage related modulation of these proteins in relation to FLT3 mutational status and induction of apoptosis. Result(s): Within one hour after exposure to ionizing radiation (IR), the AML cells (NB4, MV4-11, HL-60, primary AML cells) showed an increase in Flt3 protein independent of mRNA levels, while the Hdm2 protein decreased. The FLT3 mutant MV4-11 cells were resistant to IR accompanied by presence of both Mcl-1 and Hdm2 protein three hours after IR. In contrast, the FLT3 wild type NB4 cells responded to IR with apoptosis and pre-apoptotic Mcl-1 down regulation. Daunorubicin (DNR) induced continuing down regulation of Hdm2 and Mcl-1 in both cell lines followed by apoptosis. Conclusion(s): Both IR and DNR treatment resulted in concerted protein modulations of Mcl-1, Hdm2 and Flt3. Cell death induction was associated with persistent attenuation of Mcl-1 and Hdm2. These observations suggest that defining the pathway(s) modulating Flt3, Hdm2 and Mcl-1 may propose new strategies to optimize therapy for the relapse prone FLT3 mutated AML patients. © 2007 Wergeland et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",Included
2535,"Evaluation of light-emitting diode (LED-835 NM) application over human gingival fibroblast: An in vitro study Since the laser and photomodulation were discovered over 50 years, they have been used for many applications in medicine and in dentistry also. In particular, light-emitting diodes therapy (LT) achieved a great success in medical treatment and photo-therapy. In the decades, LT has been used for several therapeutic purposes. Many beneficial effects have been demonstrated in vitro and in vivo, including antibacterial, antiviral, antitumor, cell differentiation, immune potentiating and tissue repair activities. Beneficial effects of LT have also been observed in clinical settings. Although there are lots of cell culture studies in low-level laser therapy, there are only a few cell culture studies in LT that have similar characteristics. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of LT on primary human gingival fibroblast cells (HGF) on elastin (ELN) gene activation using Real Time PCR. ELN gene activation is directly connected with elastin protein production and HGF functionality. Human gingival tissue biopsies were obtained from three healthy patients during tooth extraction. The gingival specimens were fragmented with a scalpel and transferred in culture dishes containing Dulbecco's modified Eagle medium supplemented with 20% fetal calf serum (FBS) and antibiotics, i.e. penicillin 100U/ml and streptomycin 100mug/ml. Cells were incubated in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2 at 37C. The medium was changed the next day and twice a week. After 15 days, the samples of gingival tissue were removed from the culture dishes. Cells were harvested after an additional 24 h incubation. Human gingival fibroblasts at the second passage were seeded on multiple 6-well plates. The cells stimulation was performed with a light-emitting diodes (LEDs) medical device type E-Light. The LED irradiation seems to be directly correlated with the elastin (ELN) gene activation. Interestingly, ELN gene expression in the cultured human gingival fibroblasts seems to be inversely related to the patients' age; in fact, its expression tends to decrease with aging. In summary, the result of the present study shows that LED irradiation promoted ELN gene expression more in elderly than in younger adults.Copyright © by BIOLIFE, s.a.s.",Excluded

Changes in the immunological status in parallel with confirmation of autonomous thyroid functioning suggested higher risk of a thyrotoxicosis recurrence making it possible to differentiate the type of observation of a DTG patient following radioiodine therapy. The availability of the above tests allows their use for the prediction of recurrences in everyday clinical practice during therapy of DTG patients with 131I.",Excluded
2585,"Ewing's sarcoma and peripheral primitive neuroectodermal tumor cells produce large quantities of bioactive tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) after radiation exposure PURPOSE: In the present study, we examined human Ewing's sarcoma (ES) and peripheral primitive neuroectodermal tumor (pPNET) cell lines that are able to produce TNF-alpha as part of the response to irradiation. Radiation-induced tumor cell production of TNF-alpha may enhance irradiation efficacy and improve the effect of local tumor irradiation. On the other hand, radiation-induced tumor cell production of TNF-alpha may adversely affect the normal tissue., METHODS AND MATERIALS: Twelve different ES/pPNET cell lines were investigated in vitro and (after establishment as tumor xenografts in athymic nude mice) in vivo for their TNF-alpha mRNA expression (real-time quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction) and TNF-alpha protein production (in vitro: enhanced amplified sensitivity immunoassay; in vivo: immunohistochemistry) after exposure to different irradiation doses (2, 5, 10, 20, 30, or 40 Gy) and after different time intervals (1, 3, 6, 12, 24, 48, or 72 h after irradiation). The bioactivity of the TNF-alpha protein was evaluated in chromogenic cytotoxicity and neutralization assays., RESULTS: Nine out of 12 ES/pPNET cell lines express constitutively significant quantities of bioactive TNF-alpha in vitro. ES/pPNET cells originating from primary tumors secreted higher TNF-alpha levels than cells derived from metastatic lesions. In 5 of the 9 TNF-alpha-producing cell lines, TNF-alpha mRNA and protein levels were upregulated after irradiation exposure in a time- and dose-dependent manner. After establishment of the ES/pPNET cell lines in athymic nude mice, the radiation-induced TNF-alpha release could be demonstrated also in the xenograft tumors in vivo (analogous to the in vitro experiments). Using the same methods for quantitative analysis, it was determined that the TNF-alpha expression of the radiation-responsive tumor cells was up to 2000-fold higher compared to the maximal radiation-induced TNF-alpha release in normal lung tissue measured during the pneumonic phase., CONCLUSION: Certain ES/pPNET cell lines produce extremely large quantities of bioactive TNF-alpha after radiation exposure in a time- and dose-dependent manner. Radiation-induced TNF-alpha production of tumor cells may be of paramount importance in respect to not only tumor behavior, but also to potential damage to normal tissue and the clinical status of the host.",Included
1605,"Targeted therapy for metastatic kidney cancer at a urologic outpatient clinic: Experience of partly nurse administrated treatment Introduction and Objectives: Since 2006 patients from Gothenburg with metastatic kidney cancer have been treated with targeted therapy at the outpatient clinic of the Urologic department, Sahlgrenska University Hospital. Therapy was started by a senior urologist and thereafter administrated by two specialized nurses conducting frequent visits for handing out medicine, blood checks, weight and blood pressure controls, patient education and tending of side effects. The responsible doctor was contacted when adjustment of the treatment was needed. All medicine was handed to the patients to ensure that a minimum of the drugs were wasted. Visits to the doctors were conducted every 4th to 6th month mostly at the time of X-ray or when needed. The objective of the study was to report our experience with targeted therapy at a urologic outpatient clinic performed as partly nurse administered. Material(s) and Method(s): Between 2006 and 2012, 82 patients in total were treated with targeted therapy and registered in a database. All treatment and survival data were recorded. There were 56 men and 26 women. Result(s): Eighty-two patients were treated in first line. Treatment time on targeted therapy ranged from 9 days to 3 years and 10 months (median 11.5 months). In the first line 58 (71%) of the patients had sunitinib, 13 (16%) sorafenib, 7 (8%) bevacizumab+interferon, 3 (4%) pazopanib and 1 (1%) had temsirolimus. Thirty-four treatments were started in the second line. Ten treatments were given in the third and 2 in the fourth line. In 2012 33 patients were treated. During that year 213 visits were conducted by the specialized nurses and 54 visits by a senior urologist. Conclusion(s): A partly nurse administrated outpatient treatment with targeted therapy is possible when performed in close contact with the responsible doctor. It makes it possible to follow up the patients with short intervals and provides a close contact which they can always turn to with the numerous problems these patients have without consuming too much of doctor time.",Excluded

The aim was to ascertain tumor response and assess prognostic factors., PATIENTS AND METHODS: Between May 2002 and June 2011, 37 consecutive patients with esophageal cancer underwent chemoradiotherapy followed by surgery. The numbers of patients in clinical stages IIA/IIIA/IIIB/IIIC were 2/24/7/4, respectively. All were given a dose of 30 Gy in 15 fractions, with concurrent chemotherapy using cisplatin and fluorouracil. Curative surgery was performed a median of 1.2 months after completion of chemoradiotherapy., RESULTS: Based on the findings from surgery, 26 patients (70%) achieved a stage reduction and six patients (16%) had a complete pathological response.

3138,"Evaluation of S100B in the diagnosis of suspected intracranial hemorrhage after minor head injury in patients who are receiving platelet aggregation inhibitors and in patients 65 years of age and older OBJECT: Cranial CT (CCT) scans and hospital admission are increasingly performed to rule out intracranial hemorrhage in patients after minor head injury (MHI), particularly in older patients and in those receiving antiplatelet therapy. This leads to high radiation exposure and a growing financial burden. The aim of this study was to determine whether the astroglial-derived protein S100B that is released into blood can be used as a reliable negative predictive tool for intracranial bleeding in patients after MHI, when they are older than 65 years or being treated with antiplatelet drugs (low-dose aspirin, clopidogrel)., METHODS: The authors conducted a prospective observational study in 2 trauma hospitals. A total of 782 patients with MHI (Glasgow Coma Scale Score 13-15) who were on medication with platelet aggregation inhibitors (PAIs) or were age 65 years and older, independent of antiplatelet therapy, were included. Clinical examination, bloodwork, observation, and CCT were performed in the traumatology emergency departments. When necessary, patients were admitted and observation took place on the ward; in these patients, CCT was performed during their hospital stay. Patients with severe trauma, focal neurological deficits, posttraumatic seizures, anticoagulant therapy, alcohol intoxication, coagulation disorder, blood sampling more than 3 hours after trauma, and unknown time of the trauma were excluded from the study. The median age of the patients was 83 years, and 69% were female. Sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values of S100B with reference to CCT findings were calculated. The cutoff of S100B was set at 0.105 mug/L., RESULTS: Of the 782 patients, 50 (6.4%) had intracranial bleeding. One patient with positive results on CCT scan showed an S100B level below 0.105 mug/L. Of all patients, 33.1% were below the cutoff. S100B showed a sensitivity of 98.0% (CI 89.5%-99.7%), a negative predictive value of 99.6% (CI 97.9%-99.9%), a specificity of 35.3% (CI 31.9%- 38.8%), and a positive predictive value of 9.4% (CI 7.2%-12.2%)., CONCLUSIONS: Levels of S100B below 0.105 mug/L can accurately predict normal CCT findings after MHI in older patients and in those treated with PAIs. Combining conventional decision criteria with measurement of S100B can reduce the CCT scan and hospital admission rates by approximately 30%.",Excluded
273,"Factors influencing aversion to specific electrodiagnostic studies Objective: To compare the degree of discomfort caused by nerve conduction studies (NCS) versus needle electromyography (EMG), and to determine what factors predict aversion to one test or the other. Method(s): Two hundred patients underwent both EMG and NCS, and were asked to indicate which test was more uncomfortable. Responses were then correlated with demographic information, testing characteristics, and medical histories to identify any notable associations. Result(s): Of the 200 patients, 58.5% (117) of the patients found the NCS more uncomfortable than EMG. Sixty-one percent (11/18) of the younger patients (18-29 years old) found EMG more uncomfortable (P = 0.08), whereas 68% (40/59) of the older patients (age greater than 60 years old) found NCS more uncomfortable (P = 0.05). Sixty-seven percent (14/21) of the patients whose BMI was less than 22 kg/m2 rated EMG as more uncomfortable (P = 0.01). Sixty-nine percent (27/39) of the patients whose BMI was greater than or equal to 38 found the NCS more uncomfortable (P = 0.02). A positive correlation existed between NCS discomfort and number of nerves tested. 67% (35/52) of the patients with polyneuropathy found NCS more uncomfortable. Conclusion(s): Nerve conduction studies are more uncomfortable than needle EMG in the majority of patients, and predictions regarding which test will be more uncomfortable for a given patient are possible. Nerve conduction studies are more uncomfortable than needle EMG for most patients, and predictions regarding which test will be more uncomfortable for a given patient are possible.Copyright © 2014 The Authors.

1353,"Ionizing radiation causes a dose-dependent release of transforming growth factor alpha in vitro from irradiated xenografts and during palliative treatment of hormone-refractory prostate carcinoma PURPOSE: Characterize the radiation response for transforming growth factor (TGF) alpha shedding in vitro and in vivo. We also report the shedding of TGF alpha by patients undergoing irradiation for hormone-refractory prostate cancer., EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: TGF alpha levels were determined by ELISA. DU145 xenografts were established on the flanks of athymic nu/nu mice. Expression of phospho-extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK)1/2 and phospho-epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and the DNA repair proteins XRCC1 and ERCC1 were determined by Western analyses., RESULTS: Exposure to ionizing radiation results in a dose-dependent release of TGF alpha. Once released, TGF alpha stimulates EGFR-ERK1/2 signaling in unirradiated cells. Blockade of the EGFR with the tyrphostin AG1478 eliminates the up-regulation XRCC1 and ERCC1 by TGF alpha or irradiation. After irradiation, cells are refractory to additional transactivation of EGFR by additional irradiation for 8 to 12 hours. Irradiation during this refractory period does not increase the expression of XRCC1 or ERCC1. Ligand activation of EGFR is maintained during the refractory period. Irradiation of DU145 xenografts also results in the activation of ERK1/2, release of TGF alpha, and a similar refractory period. Ionizing irradiation also results in the release of TGF alpha for patients undergoing radiation therapy for hormone-refractory prostate cancer., CONCLUSIONS: Irradiation results in a dose-dependent increase in TGF alpha capable of enhancing the growth of DU145 xenografts. TGF alpha is also shed following radiation therapy of patients treated for hormone-refractory prostate cancer. Radiation transactivation of the EGFR produces a radio-refractory period, which lasts for several hours. During this period, additional irradiation fails to induce XRCC1, ERCC1, or additional TGF alpha release.",Included

Methods Among lung cancer patients receiving SBRT between 2005 and 2016, we evaluated those treated with a total dose of 40-60 Gy in five fractions with curative intent who either were staged as cT1-4N0M0 or experienced postoperative isolated local recurrence. We analyzed the incidence of radiation pneumonitis (RP) in all patients and local recurrence and overall survival (OS) in T1a-2a patients. Results A total of 508 patients were eligible, including 42 with IIPs. The median follow-up was 32.3 (6.0-120.9) months. Significantly more patients with IIPs had grade >=3 RP than did those without IIPs (12% vs. 3%, p = 0.009). The 2-year local recurrence rate was low in both groups (3.4% vs. 5.6%, p = 0.38). The 2-year OS rate was significantly lower in the patients with IIPs (42.2% vs. 80.9%, p < 0.001), although death from lung cancer was comparable (p = 0.74).

2506,"Two radiation-induced chromosomal inversions in mice (Mus musculus) Whole-body x-irradiation of male mice has produced presumptive paracentric inversions in 15 animals, as evidenced by high frequencies of first meiotic anaphase bridges. Two of the highest frequencies observed have been propagated through several generations and found to behave as dominant genes. Acentric fragments were observed associated with about 10% of the bridges. The first inversion, in linkage group XIII, has been designated In(13)1Rk, and the second, in linkage group XVII, In(17)2Rk. For In(13)1Rk, recombination was reduced between loci inside and outside the inverted segment.",Included
1926,"Outcome of three-fraction gamma knife radiosurgery for brain metastases according to fractionation scheme: preliminary results Purpose: The optimal interfraction intervals for fractionated radiosurgery has yet to be established. We investigated the outcome of fractionated gamma knife radiosurgery (FGKRS) for large brain metastases (BMs) according to different interfraction intervals. Method(s): Between September 2016 and May 2018, a total of 45 patients who underwent FGKRS for BMs were enrolled in this study. They were divided into two groups (standard fractionation over 3 consecutive days with a 24-h interfraction interval versus prolonged fractionation over 4 or 5 days with an interfraction interval of at least 48-h). BMs with >= 2 cm in maximum diameter or >= 5 cm3 in volume were included in analysis. Result(s): Among 52 BMs treated with 3-fraction GKRS, 25 (48.1%) were treated with standard fractionation scheme, and 27 (51.9%) with prolonged fractionation scheme. The median follow-up period was 10.5 months (range 5-25). Local tumor control rates of the standard group were 88.9% at 6 months and 77.8% at 12 months, whereas those of the prolonged group were 100% at 6 and 12 months (p = 0.023, log-rank test). In multivariate analysis, fractionation scheme (hazard ratio [HR] 0.294, 95% CI 0.099-0.873; p = 0.027) and tumor volume (HR 0.200, 95% CI 0.051-0.781; p = 0.021) were revealed as the only significant factors affecting the local tumor control after 3-fraction GKRS. Conclusion(s): Our preliminary tumor control results suggest a promising role of 3-fraction GKRS with an interfraction interval of at least 48-h. This fractionation regimen could be an effective and safe treatment option in the management of large BMs.Copyright © 2019, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.",Excluded
345,"Recovery kinetics in mouse skin and CaNT tumours Recovery kinetics and recovery capacity were studied in a fast proliferating normal tissue, skin, and in an anaplastic mouse mammary carcinoma, CaNT. Three fractions per day of X-rays, repeated over 5 days, were given at varying interfraction intervals from 0 to 8 h. The rate of recovery in tumours (t1/2 = 0.31 +/- 0.15 h for local control) was significantly faster than in skin (t1/2 = 0.96 +/- 0.10 h). By contrast, the fractionation sensitivity of CaNT tumours was less than that of skin (alpha/beta = 43.3 +/- 8.5 Gy vs. alpha/beta = 7.9 +/- 0.2 Gy). Tissues with recovery half-times similar to or longer than that determined for skin would be at risk if interfraction intervals less than 6 h are used in regimes which involve the use of two or more fractions per day. This would be especially true for tissues that show a greater sensitivity to dose fractionation, and hence more sparing of radiation damage with hyperfractionation.",Excluded

The histological analysis showed diffuse large B-cell lymphoma and intravascular large B-cell lymphoma in 12 and 1 patient, respectively. After initial chemotherapy, 1 patient showed initial complete response, 8 showed partial response and 4 showed progressive disease. Eleven patients had primary CNSL and 2 had secondary CNSL. The median total radiation dose was 40 Gy (range, 30-60 Gy). The median overall survival time from start of salvage RT was 16.3 months. The 1-year overall survival rate was 64%. Univariate analysis could not help to identify the factor for worse prognosis. Salvage RT is effective for patients with recurrent/refractory primary or secondary CNSL after chemotherapy.",Excluded

2349,"Clinical efficacy of 2-phase versus 4-phase computed tomography for localization in primary hyperparathyroidism BACKGROUND: Four-dimensional computed tomography is being used increasingly for localization of abnormal glands in primary hyperparathyroidism. We hypothesized that compared with traditional 4-phase imaging, 2-phase imaging would halve the radiation dose without compromising parathyroid localization and clinical outcomes., METHODS: A transition from 4-phase to 2-phase imaging was instituted between 2009 and 2010. A pre-post analysis was performed on patients undergoing operative treatment with a parathyroid protocol computed tomography, and relevant data were correlated with operative findings. Sensitivity, positive predictive value, technical success, and cure rates were calculated. The Fisher exact test or chi(2) test assessed the significance of 2-phase and 4-phase imaging and operative findings., RESULTS: Twenty-seven patients had traditional four-dimensional computed tomography and 35 had modified 2-phase computed tomography. Effective radiation doses were 6.8 mSy for 2-phase and 14 mSv for 4-phase. Four-phase computed tomography had a sensitivity and positive predictive value of 93% and 96%, respectively. Two-phase computed tomography had a comparable sensitivity and positive predictive value of 97% and 94%, respectively. Eight patients with discordant imaging had an average parathyroid weight of 240 g compared with 1,300 g for all patients. Technical surgical success (90% for 4-phase computed tomography versus 91% 2-phase computed tomography) and normocalcemia rates at 6 months (88% for both) did not differ between computed tomography protocols. Computed tomography correctly predicted multiglandular disease and localization for reoperations in 88% and 90% of cases, respectively, with no difference by computed tomography protocol., CONCLUSION: With regard to surgical outcomes and localization, 2-phase parathyroid computed tomography is equivalent to 4-phase for parathyroid localization, including small adenomas, reoperative cases, and multiglandular disease. Two-phase parathyroid computed tomography for operative planning should be considered to avoid unnecessary radiation exposure. Copyright © 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.",Excluded
3162,"Impact of Hybrid Operating Rooms on Long-Term Clinical Outcomes Following Fenestrated and Branched Endovascular Aortic Repair Purpose: Evaluate the impact of hybrid operating room (HOR) guidance on the long-term clinical outcomes following fenestrated and branched endovascular repair (F-BEVAR) for complex aortic aneurysms. Material(s) and Method(s): Prospectively collected registry data were retrospectively analyzed to compare the procedural, short- and long-term outcomes of consecutive F-BEVAR performed from January 2010 to December 2014 under standard mobile C-arm versus hybrid room guidance in a high-volume aortic center. Result(s): A total of 262 consecutive patients, including 133 patients treated with a mobile C-arm equipped operating room and 129 with a HOR guidance, were enrolled in this study. Patient radiation exposure and contrast media volume were significantly reduced in the HOR group. Short-term clinical outcomes were improved despite higher case complexity in the HOR group, with no statistical significance. At a median follow-up of 63.3 months (Q1 33.4, Q3 75.9) in the C-arm group, and 44.9 months (Q1 25.1, Q3 53.5, p=0.53) in the HOR group, there was no statistically significant difference in terms of target vessel occlusion and limb occlusion. When the endograft involved 3 or more fenestrations and/or branches (complex F-BEVAR), graft instability (36% vs 25%, p=0.035), reintervention on target vessels (20% vs 11%, p=0.019) and total reintervention rates (24% vs 15%, p=0.032) were significantly reduced in the HOR group. The multivariable Cox regression analysis did not show statistically significant differences for long-term death and aortic-related death between the 2 groups.

501,"Organ biodistribution of Germanium-68 in rat in the presence and absence of [68Ga]Ga-DOTA-TOC for the extrapolation to the human organ and whole-body radiation dosimetry Positron Emission Tomography (PET) and in particular gallium-68 (68Ga) applications are growing exponentially worldwide contributing to the expansion of nuclear medicine and personalized management of patients. The significance of 68Ga utility is reflected in the implementation of European Pharmacopoeia monographs. However, there is one crucial point in the monographs that might limit the use of the generators and consequently expansion of 68Ga applications and that is the limit of 0.001% of Germanium-68 (68Ge(IV)) radioactivity content in a radiophar-maceutical. We have investigated the organ distribution of 68Ge(IV) in rat and estimated human dosimetry parameters in order to provide experimental evidence for the determination and justification of the 68Ge(IV) limit. Male and female rats were injected in the tail vein with formulated [68Ge]GeCl4 in the absence or presence of [68Ga]Ga-DOTA-TOC. The tissue radioactivity distribution data was extrapolated for the estimation of human organ equivalent doses and total effective dose using Organ Level Internal Dose Assessment Code software (OLINDA/EXM). 68Ge(IV) was evenly distributed among the rat organs and fast renal excretion prevailed. Human organ equivalent dose and total effective dose estimates indicated that the kidneys were the dose-limiting organs (185+/-54 muSv/MBq for female and 171+/-38 muSv/MBq for male) and the total effective dose was 15.5+/-0.1 and 10.7+/-1.2 muSv/MBq, respectively for female and male. The results of this dosimetry study conclude that the 68Ge(IV) limit currently recommended by monographs could be increased considerably (>100 times) without exposing the patient to harm given the small absorbed doses to normal organs and fast excretion.",Excluded
2286,"Corneal Nerve and Epithelial Cell Alterations in Corneal Allodynia: An In Vivo Confocal Microscopy Case Series Purpose To investigate morphological changes of the corneal epithelium and subbasal nerves in patients with corneal allodynia using in vivo confocal microscopy (IVCM). Design Case-control study of patients with corneal allodynia and healthy controls. Methods Ten eyes of six patients were diagnosed with corneal allodynia at a single center and compared to fifteen healthy eyes. IVCM of the central cornea was performed on all subjects and controls. Images were retrospectively analyzed numbers of total corneal subbasal nerves, main trunks and branches, total nerve length and density, nerve branching, and tortuosity, superficial and basal epithelial cell densities, and superficial epithelial cell size. Results Corneal allodynia was seen in patients with dry eye disease, recurrent corneal erosion syndrome, exposure to ultraviolet radiation, and Accutane use. Compared to controls, patients with corneal allodynia had a significant decrease in the total numbers of subbasal nerves (P=.014), nerve branches (P=.006), total nerve length (P=.0029), total nerve density (P=.0029) and superficial and basal epithelial cell densities (P=.0004, P=.0036) with an increase in superficial epithelial cell size (P=.016). There were no statistically significant differences in the number of subbasal nerve main trunks (P=.09), nerve branching (P=.21), and nerve tortuosity (P=.05). Conclusions Corneal IVCM enables near-histological visualization and quantification of the cellular and neural changes in corneal allodynia. Regardless of etiology, corneal allodynia is associated with decreased corneal epithelial cell densities, increased epithelial cell size, and decreased numbers and lengths of subbasal nerves despite an unremarkable slit-lamp examination. Therefore, IVCM may be useful in the management of patients with corneal allodynia.Copyright © 2016 Elsevier Inc.",Excluded
314,"Mortality among diagnostic medical radiation workers in South Korea, 1996-2015 OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the risk for all-cause and cause-specific mortality in diagnostic medical radiation workers in South Korea., METHODS: The study population included all diagnostic medical radiation workers enrolled in the National Dosimetry Registry (NDR) between 1996 and 2011. NDR data were linked with mortality data obtained from national registries through 2015. Standardised mortality ratios (SMRs) and relative standardised mortality ratios (rSMRs) were calculated for external comparison and for adjustment of the cohort's overall healthiness., RESULTS: A total of 1099 deaths (974 in men and 125 in women) were reported from among 80 837 medical radiation workers. The SMRs for all causes of death were significantly lower than expected in both men (SMR 0.45, 95% CI 0.42 to 0.48) and women (SMR 0.49, 95% CI 0.41 to 0.58). No excesses were observed for any specific cause of death. The findings were similar by job title, calendar year of entry and year of birth. However, relative to all causes of death, mortality from all cancers (rSMR 1.60, 95% CI 1.41 to 1.82), leukaemia, colon cancer, stomach cancer and diseases of the circulatory system increased significantly among male workers. The results for female workers were limited due to small number of deaths; however, the rSMR for all cancers was significantly elevated (rSMR 1.70, 95% CI 1.17 to 2.46)., CONCLUSIONS: This cohort showed lower mortality among diagnostic medical radiation workers than in the general population. However, occupational factors may have been involved in the increased relative mortality for several causes of death. Copyright © Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2018. No commercial re-use.

Both young and adult, un-irradiated and irradiated hamsters were highly susceptible to L. carinii but mice (un-irradiated or irradiated) were poor hosts. All hamsters (18 un-irradiated and seven irradiated) became infected. Seven out of nine mice in an un-irradiated series became infected. There was apparently 'age resistance' or 'young susceptibility' in the hamsters. The susceptibility of young hamsters appeared similar to that of new-born Carworth white rats and cotton rats. The pattern of infection in un-irradiated and irradiated hamsters was similar. Results from irradiated animals were insufficient to draw any clear conclusions on the effect of irradiation to susceptibility to infection with L. carinii. X-irradiation apparently did not affect the innate susceptibility cr resistance of hamsters and mice to worms. The duration and intensity of microfilaraemia was apparently higher in irradiated hamsters.",Excluded
177,"Effect of irradiation, asbestos and chemical cocarcinogens on incidence of sarcoma on implants An implant can act as a physical carcinogen. Chemicals applied to its surface can augment that. To explore if cocarcinogenesis would affect the incidence of tumour on implants, we tested several physical (asbestos, beta irradiation) and chemical (acridine orange, phorbol methyl ester, cigarette smoke tar, extract of Agaricus bisporus mushroom) carcinogens on 25 mm diameter nitrocellulose filters implanted in groups of BALB/c mice in 9 experiments. Saline was applied in 287 concurrent controls. Irradiation by 540 kBq I-125 fibrinogen on foreign bodies of surface area 20sq cm induced tumour in 6/6 pilot animals (expected 2/6) and in 25/36 animals (controls 13/29; p < 0.04). The mean dose (beta and gamma) to cells within 20 mum of the filter surface was estimated to be 782 mGy. Exposures to 270kBq or less were not significantly cocarcinogenic with single implants. Radiation from the paired implants was detectible up to 80 weeks. Asbestos, however, 2.3 or 4.6 mgm on implants did not in 3 trials increase sarcoma yield significantly, but did induce mesothelial-type growths in the peritoneum. Asbestos (2.3 mg) injected without an implant provoked no tumour at the site. The chemical carcinogen acridine orange gave ambiguous results, and the others reduced tumour incidence insignificantly. The irradiation history may be germane in the human cases that arise.",Excluded

Method(s): Twenty-six patients with confirmed maxillary sinus carcinoma were enrolled in this study from May 2009 to April 2011. Patients underwent proton beam therapy and intra-arterial infusion chemotherapy with cisplatin. Result(s): The median total dose was 70.4 GyE per 32 fractions, and the median dose of cisplatin was 300 mg/body for six cycles of intra-arterial infusion. The 3-year overall survival rate was 58% for all patients (n = 26), 58% for patients with stage T4 disease (n = 12), 57% for patients with <Stage T3 disease (n = 14), 66% for patients with squamous cell carcinoma (n = 15) and 45% for patients with non-squamous cell carcinoma (n = 11).

2732,"Lifetime cancer risks from occupational radiation exposure among workers at interventional radiology departments PURPOSE: Interventional medical radiation workers represent an under-studied population worldwide, although they receive relatively high occupational radiation doses. This study aimed to estimate the lifetime cancer risk from occupational radiation exposure among workers at interventional radiology departments. METHOD(S): A field survey of interventional medical workers in nationwide branches of the Korean Society of Interventional Radiology was conducted in 2017. Organ-specific radiation doses were estimated using national dose registry data and conversion coefficients provided by the International Commission on Radiological Protection. Lifetime attributable risk (LAR) and lifetime fractional risk (LFR) were calculated based on realistic exposure scenarios using a radiation risk assessment tool. RESULT(S): LARs from occupational radiation exposure until the age of retirement for all cancers combined were 338 (90.3-796.1), 121 (33.5-288.7), and 156 (41.1-390.6) per 100,000 individuals for male radiologists, male radiologic technologists, and female nurses, respectively. LFR for all cancers combined ranged from 0.22% (0.06-0.53) to 0.63% (0.17-1.47). Regarding the organ site, the highest LAR and LFR among all groups were observed for thyroid cancer. CONCLUSION(S): This study provides timely evidence of potential cancer burden from the current levels of occupational radiation exposure among workers at interventional radiology departments. The risks varied by occupational groups, and workers, particularly interventional radiologists, need to be carefully monitored for radiation.",Included
3438,"Volumetric bone mineral density estimation using a 3d reconstruction method from dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry Volumetric BMD (vBMD) has been shown to be strongly related to bone strength and osteoporotic hip fracture. This can estimated for the femoral neck from Dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) by using the projected area as: vBMD=BMC/A2 where BMC is the bone mineral content and A the projected area on the DXA image. However, such approximation cannot be used for other critical locations, such as the trochanteric and adjacent shaft region. An accurate quantification of the vBMD can be obtain from Quantitative Computed Tomoghaphy (QCT), however, this modality subjects the patient to a high radiation dose and is not as widely available as DXA central devices. In this work an estimation of the vBMD from a DXA image is presented by using a 3D reconstruction method. The reconstruction method uses a 3D statistical model, constructed from a dataset of QCT scans which describes the statistical variations in shape and BMD distribution. The 3D statistical model is registered onto the 2D DXA image of the patient so that the projection of the model matches the DXA image. The result of this reconstruction process is a patient specific volumetric reconstruction of the BMD distribution onto which the vBMD can then be extracted for specific regions. Reconstructions were subsequently obtained from the DXA images of 30 patients (15 male and 15 females with an average age of 50+/-13 years). The vBMD of the femoral neck and the trochanteric region was extracted from the reconstructions and the vBMD in the corresponding regions of the QCT scans of the same subjects were considered the ground truth. The linear correlation with the ground truth vBMD then indicates the vBMD estimation accuracy. For the trochanteric and shaft region, our method achieved a strong correlation with a correlation coefficient of 0.94 and 0.93 and a Mean Average Error (MAE) of 15.3 and 21.8mg/cm3 respectively. In addition, the proposed method resulted in a MAE of 17.2mg/cm3 and a correlation coefficient of 0.92 for the femoral neck region whereas the vBMD, estimated using the projected area, resulted in a correlation coefficient of 0.91. These results indicates that our proposed method accurately estimates the vBMD of the trochanteric, shaft and femoral neck region from DXA. This potentially allows for an improved fracture risk estimation while maintaining DXA as the current standard modality.",Excluded

We retrospectively evaluated the outcome of 103 (female: 39, male: 64) pts, who underwent 1st ASCT for HL from September 1990 to November 2008 and relapsed or progressed. Sixty-four pts had been transplanted for refractory disease. The median time to relapse/progression was 5 (0.7-132) months post ASCT, and < 12 months in 77/103 pts. The median age at relapse was 29 (13-67) years. The stage at relapse was advanced (III or IV) in 58, and B-symptoms were present in 26 pts. In 41 pts, progression of disease to additional sites was noted. Salvage treatment was chemotherapy +/- irradiation (R/T) in 75 pts, R/T only in 6, 2nd SCT in 14 (ASCT in 3, and alloSCT with a reduced-intensity regimen in 11), while 2 refused any therapy. Six pts had a positive PET-scan without clinical suggestion of active disease, and did not receive any treatment (watch-and-wait approach). Sixty of the 95 treated pts achieved a complete (38 pts, 40%) or partial (22 pts, 24%) remission. The interval of < 12 months from 1st ASCT to relapse, advanced stage and presence of B-symptoms at relapse, as well as the disease refractoriness before 1st ASCT emerged as significant adverse factors for response rate (P < 0,05 by t-test). The median survival for all pts was 29.5 months. Multivariate analysis revealed late relapse (> 12 months), absence of B-symptoms at relapse and disease sensitivity before 1st ASCT as significant factors for prolonged survival (P < 0.05). The type of treatment had no impact on survival rates. Three of the 14 re-transplanted pts (2 allo- and 1 autografted) are alive (with 2 in CR for 7 and 5 years, respectively). Eight re-transplanted pts succumbed to progressive disease and 3 to treatment related toxicity. Interestingly, all 6 patients managed with the watch-and-wait approach are alive without disease progression for a median of 12 (1.5-45) months. Our results confirm that selected pts with relapsed or progressed HL following ASCT could be rescued with recent treatment modalities. Currently, given the conventional and alternative treatment options, management of relapsed disease post 1st ASCT remains a challenge and prospective studies with large series of pts are needed to establish the appropriate approach.",Excluded

Coronary artery segments were assessed for image quality and significant luminal diameter narrowing. Sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive values (PPV), negative predictive values (NPV), and accuracy of both CTCA groups were determined using conventional catheter angiography (CCA) as reference standard. Radiation dose values were calculated., RESULTS: Both groups were comparable regarding gender, body weight, cardiovascular risk profile, severity of CAD, mean heart rate, heart rate variability, and Agatston score (all p>0.05). There was no significant difference in the rate of non-assessable coronary segments between group 1 (1.6%, 24/1404) and group 2 (1.4%, 19/1385; p=0.77); non-diagnostic image quality was significantly (p<0.001) more often attributed to stair step artifacts in group 1. Segment-based sensitivity, specificity, PPV, NPV, and accuracy were 98%, 98%, 88%, 100%, and 100% among group 1; 96%, 99%, 90%, 100%, and 98% among group 2, respectively. Parameters of diagnostic performance were similar (all p>0.05). Mean effective radiation dose of prospectively ECG-gated CTCA (2.2+/-0.4 mSv) was significantly (p<0.0001) smaller than that of retrospectively ECG-gated CTCA (8.1+/-0.6 mSv)., CONCLUSION: Prospectively ECG-gated CTCA yields similar image quality, performs as accurately as retrospectively ECG-gated CTCA in patients having heart rates <=70 bpm while being associated with a lower mean effective radiation dose.

1158,"Can FRAX help portuguese men? The Portuguese model of the FRAX algorithm became available in June 2011. We reviewed the value of FRAX in a male population, to evaluate (1) if FRAX can identify patients with fracture risk (2) If it is relevant in patients without established risk factors. We reviewed all the DXA examinations in 2,5 years (1st July 2013 to 30th December 2015).A total of 6185 patients were examined with at least spine and femur analysis. During this period 395 examinations were done in men, of which 49 were excluded (7 which were incomplete and 42 patients who were on osteoporosis therapy). The study population consisted therefore of 346 examinations. Patients filled in a questionnaire. The technologist reviewed that data, inquired about fracture mechanisms and discussed risk factors with the patients. In many cases other relevant examinations (spine or hip x-ray, CT, MR) could be accessed on PACS. We had no laboratorial data. Previous fragility fractures were identified in 84 patients. For this study,FRAX values in patients with fractures were calculated ""without fracture"". We chose 10% as the threshold for the 10 year probability of major osteoporotic fracture (PMOF). The ratio of fractures increased slightly with age groups, except after 80y, and was very similar to osteoporosis diagnosed by DXA. Correlation with FRAX values was less reliable and FRAX identified much fewer cases. In patients without risk factors,FRAX didn't identify any patient with 10 year PMOF > 8%. The study population has several limitations: Its size is very small in comparison with studies with female patients, and it can suffer a selection bias. The poor performance of the FRAX threshold against DXAT-scores should be validated in a larger and prospective study. In the Portuguese male population even FRAX values computed with bone mineral density (BMD) data can sub evaluate fracture risk. FRAX values obtained without BMD should be interpreted with precaution. (Figure Presented).",Excluded
846,"31P NMR spectroscopy can predict the optimum interval between fractionated irradiation doses This study was performed to clarify whether changes in the metabolites observed by phosphorous-31 magnetic resonance spectroscopy (31P-MRS) could indicate an optimum interval between two doses of radiation in a murine tumor model. Murine mammary carcinoma cells, FM3A, were irradiated 7 days after transplantation with a single 5 Gy dose without anesthesia. 31P spectra were measured with a spectrometer up to 30 days. The beta-ATP/Pi and PCr/Pi values were calculated from the peak area of each spectrum. In a fractionation experiment, two fractions of irradiation at a 5 Gy per fraction were given at 0, 1, 2, 3 and 6 day intervals. Tumor growth delay was also scored to determine the fractionated radiation effect. In the control group, beta-ATP/Pi and PCr/Pi decreased with tumor growth. In the single irradiation group, the tumor did not grow up to day 6, and an initial rise and subsequent decrease in beta-ATP/Pi and PCr/Pi were observed. Maximum beta-ATP/Pi and PCr/Pi were observed on day 2 after irradiation. In a fractionation experiment, the greatest growth delay was observed in the two day interval group, in which maximum beta-ATP/Pi and PCr/Pi were demonstrated in 31P-MRS. Our results suggested that changes in the metabolites observed by 31P-MRS could be useful indicators for determining the fractionation schedule in radiation therapy.",Excluded

Result(s): Fifty-seven patients were included: 22 CRT and 35 Non-CRT. The CRT cohort had more patients > 60 years (100% vs. 60%, p < 0.001) and tumors >5 cm (68.2% vs 54.3%, p = 0.023). The median follow-up was 25.8 (1.5-155.2) months. There was no significant difference in 2-year local control (LC), distant control (DC), or progression-free survival (PFS) between the two groups. The 2-year overall survival (OS) was significantly higher for the CRT cohort (94.1% vs. 71.6%, p = 0.033). Amongst the subset of patients in the CRT cohort who received trimodality therapy, the 2-year LC, DC, PFS, and OS was 68.6%, 100%, 68.6%, and 100%, respectively. Conclusion(s): The use of concurrent paclitaxel CRT demonstrates promising outcomes. Given these results, we are currently evaluating the safety and efficacy of this regimen in prospective, phase 2 trial (NCT 03921008).Copyright © 2021 The Authors",Excluded
3477,"Survival Impact of Cardiac Dose Following Lung Stereotactic Body Radiotherapy Heart dose has been emerging as a strong predictor of outcomes in radiation therapy treatment for lung cancer. It is necessary to determine the impact of dose to substructures of the heart on overall survival. Heart substructures were contoured retrospectively on 189 patients treated with stereotactic body radiotherapy. Clinical variables and the dose to these structures were correlated with non-cancer-related deaths. Higher bilateral ventricles max dose is associated with poorer survival. Heart dose parameters should be considered when planning patients for stereotactic body radiotherapy. Introduction: The purpose of this study was to determine the impact of radiation dose to substructures of the heart in lung stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) patients on non-cancer-related deaths. Method(s): Patients treated with lung SBRT at a single institution from 2005 to 2013 were included. The heart and its substructures were contoured, and dose was calculated including mean, max, and max 10 cc dose. Clinical variables including stage, histology, age, gender, Charlson comorbidity index (CCI), preexisting cardiac disease, pulmonary function (forced expiratory volume in 1 second, diffusion capacity), and smoking status were explored for association with non-cancer-related deaths in univariable (UVA) and multivariable (MVA) analyses. Heart dosimetric parameters were correlated with the risk of radiation pneumonitis (RP) using UVA and MVA. Result(s): A total of 189 patients were included with median age of 76 years (range, 48-93 years). Of these patients, 45.5% were female, 27.5% were T2, 16.9% were current smokers, 64% had preexisting cardiac risk factors, and 34.5% had CCI score of >= 3. Mean lung dose +/- SD was 456 +/- 231 cGy. Heart max, mean, and 10 cc doses were 1867 +/- 1712 cGy, 265 +/- 269 cGy, and 1150 +/- 1075 cGy, respectively. There were 14 (7.4%) >= Grade 2 RP and 3 (1.6%) were >= Grade 3. The median overall survival was 37.3 months (95% confidence interval, 29.8-45.3 months). On UVA, female gender (P <.01), higher Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (P =.01), cardiac risk (P <.01), CCI (P <.01), and bilateral ventricles max dose (P =.02) were associated with non-cancer-related deaths; on MVA, bilateral ventricles max dose was significant (P =.05). No heart parameters were associated with RP. Conclusion(s): Higher bilateral ventricles max dose is associated with poorer survival. Heart dose parameters should be considered when planning patients for SBRT.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Inc.",Excluded
1788,"Feasibility of wide detector CT perfusion imaging performed during routine staging and restaging of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma Purpose: To evaluate the feasibility of CT perfusion performed during routine multiphase contrast-enhanced CT on a 160 mm wide-coverage 256-slice scanner in patients with pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). Method(s): Fifty-seven patients had a CT perfusion acquisition during their routine multiphase CT. Perfusion was performed 5 to 42.5 s (15 passes at 2.5 s intervals) after intravenous contrast administration (4.2-5 ml/s), followed by pancreatic parenchymal and portal venous phases for clinical interpretation. Perfusion maps were generated and blood flow (BF), blood volume (BV), and permeability surface area product (PS) for tumor and uninvolved pancreas were calculated using deconvolution algorithms and compared to existing similar publications. Radiation dose information was recorded and size-specific dose estimate (SSDE) was calculated using body dimensions. Result(s): Diagnostic quality of standard images was unaffected by performing the perfusion acquisition. Average tumor center BF was 20.8 +/- 12.1 ml/100 g/min, BV 2.5 +/- 2.1 ml/100 g and PS 15.5 +/- 39.4 ml/100 g/min. Average pancreas BF was 90.8 +/- 50.2 ml/100 g/min, BV 11.9 +/- 4.3 ml/100 g and PS 33.6 +/- 27.7 ml/100 g/min. For the perfusion acquisition, mean SSDE was 57 +/- 11 mGy, CTDIvol 43 +/- 6 mGy and DLP 685 +/- 100 mGy-cm. Conclusion(s): Adding a perfusion CT acquisition to standard pancreatic CT protocol is feasible using a wide-detector 256-slice CT scanner and adds quantitative information while maintaining diagnostic quality of the standard of care examination. This novel protocol adds no time or cost to the examination and yields perfusion parameters that are comparable to existing literature using a separate dedicated perfusion protocol.

2802,"Optimization of radiotherapy for Dupuytren's disease Purpose: Radiotherapy prevents progression of Dupuytren's contracture. Herein, 1-year results of a prospective randomized trial comparing 2 different dose concepts are presented. Patients and Methods: 129 patients (67 males, 62 females) were included in the study with a minimum 1-year follow-up: 69 had bilateral and 60 unilateral involvement of Dupyutren's disease accounting for 198 irradiated hands. According to Tubiana, 73 hands had Stage N, 61 Stage N/I (<= 10degree flexion deformity), 59 Stage I (11 to 45degree) and 5 Stage II disease (46 to 90degree). Radiotherapy was randomly delivered: group A (63 patients/95 hands) received 10 times 3 Gy (total: 30 Gy) in 2 series (each 5 times 3 Gy) separated by 8 weeks; group B (66 patients/103 hands) received 7 times 3 Gy (total: 21 Gy) within 2 weeks. Orthovoltage radiotherapy (120 kV) with 40 cm standard cones and individual shielding was applied. Patient and disease parameters were equally distributed in both groups. Evaluation (toxicity, efficacy) was performed at 3 and 12 months with regard to subjective (patient's opinion) and objective parameters (palpation, measurements, comparative photographs - physician). Result(s): Acute toxicity was minimal: 76 (38%) hands had skin reactions CTC Grade 1, 12 (6%) CTC Grade 2. Chronic side effects (dryness, skin atrophy, change of sensation, LENT Grade 1) occurred in 9 (5%) hands without differences between treatment groups. At 3 and 12 months follow-up, subjective symptoms and objective signs, nodules and cords, were reduced in both groups (p < 0.01) with no differences between groups: a total of 110 (55%) hands (group A: 55, group B: 55) regressed, 74 (37%) hands (group A: 35; group B: 39) were stable. Overall and mean number of nodules, cords and skin changes decreased at 3 and 12 months. 16 of 198 (8%) hands (group A: 7; group B: 9) progressed at 12 months follow-up (""treatment failure""); at 1 year, 7 of 60 patients with unilateral Dupyutren's disease required prophylactic radiotherapy for the contralateral hand due to disease progression. Conclusion(s): Prophylactic radiotherapy reduces symptoms and prevents disease progression in early-stage Dupyutren's disease. Both treatment concepts are well-tolerated and equally effective. Acute toxicity is slightly increased with treatment concept B (7 times 3 Gy), while chronic sequelae are low in both treatment groups. Long-term evaluation with follow-up of more than 5 years has to be awaited to recommend one or the other dose concept.",Excluded
945,"Increased oxidative stress in barn swallows from the Chernobyl region The Chernobyl nuclear accident produced the largest unintended release of radionuclides in history, with dramatic consequences for humans and other organisms. Exposure to ionizing radiation is known to reduce circulating and stored levels of specific antioxidants in birds and humans, thus potentially increasing oxidative stress. However, overall effects of radioactive exposure on oxidative status have never been investigated in any free ranging vertebrate. We measured plasma antioxidant capacity and concentration of reactive oxygen metabolites in adult barn swallows (Hirundo rustica) from colonies with variable background radiation levels in the Chernobyl region in Ukraine and Belarus. We predicted that antioxidants would decrease while reactive oxygen metabolites would increase with exposure to increasing levels of radiation at the breeding sites. Consistent with this expectation, radiation level positively predicted plasma concentration of reactive oxygen metabolites, whereas no significant covariation was found with non-enzymatic plasma antioxidant capacity. An index of oxidative stress was also larger in barn swallows exposed to high contamination levels. Thus, radioactive contamination appeared to be responsible for the increased generation of reactive oxygen metabolites and the imbalance between reactive oxygen metabolites and non-enzymatic plasma antioxidant capacity.",Included

1160,"Deficiency in PER proteins has no effect on the rate of spontaneous and radiation-induced carcinogenesis There is a growing body of evidence that components of the circadian clock are involved in modulation of numerous signaling pathways, and that clock deregulation due to environmental or genetic factors contributes to the development of various pathologies, including cancer. Previous work performed in tissue culture and in in vivo mouse models defined mammalian PERIOD proteins as tumor suppressors, although some experimental inconsistencies (the use of mice on mixed genetic background, lack of sexual discrimination) did not allow a definitive conclusion. To address this issue in a systematic way, we performed a detailed analysis comparing the incidence of tumor development after low-dose ionizing radiation in male and female wild-type, Per1-/-, and Per2-/- mice. We showed that in contrast to previous reports deficiency in either Per1 or Per2 genes by itself does not make mice more tumor-prone; moreover, some of the long-term effects of ionizing radiation in Per2-deficient mice are reminiscent more of accelerated aging rather than tumor-prone phenotype. Our histopathological analysis also revealed significant sexual dimorphism both in the rate of radiation-induced tumorigenesis and in the spectrum of tumors developed, which underscores the importance of using sex-matched experimental groups for in vivo studies. Based on our results, we suggest that the role of PER proteins as bone fide tumor suppressors needs to be reevaluated. © 2013 Landes Bioscience.",Included

834,"Brachytherapy for early oral tongue cancer: low dose rate to high dose rate To examine the compatibility of low dose rate (LDR) with high dose rate (HDR) brachytherapy, we reviewed 399 patients with early oral tongue cancer (T1-2N0M0) treated solely by brachytherapy at Osaka University Hospital between 1967 and 1999. For patients in the LDR group (n = 341), the treatment sources consisted of Ir-192 pin for 227 patients (1973-1996; irradiated dose, 61-85 Gy; median, 70 Gy), Ra-226 needle for 113 patients (1967-1986; 55-93 Gy; median, 70 Gy). Ra-226 and Ir-192 were combined for one patient. Ir-192 HDR (microSelectron-HDR) was used for 58 patients in the HDR group (1991-present; 48-60 Gy; median, 60 Gy). LDR implantations were performed via oral and HDR via a submental/submandibular approach. The dose rates at the reference point for the LDR group were 0.30 to 0.8 Gy/h, and for the HDR group 1.0 to 3.4 Gy/min. The patients in the HDR group received a total dose of 48-60 Gy (8-10 fractions) during one week. Two fractions were administered per day (at least a 6-h interval). The 3- and 5-year local control rates for patients in the LDR group were 85% and 80%, respectively, and those in the HDR group were both 84%. HDR brachytherapy showed the same lymph-node control rate as did LDR brachytherapy (67% at 5 years). HDR brachytherapy achieved the same locoregional result as did LDR brachytherapy.

768,"Ventriculoperitoneal shunt malfunction: Cumulative effect of cost, radiation, and turnaround time on the patient and the health care system OBJECTIVE. The purpose of this study was to reiterate the predominance of CT in evaluating ventriculoperitoneal shunt malfunction in terms of cost-effectiveness, reduction of radiation exposure, and turnaround time as the measurement parameters. MATERIALS AND METHODS. This retrospective study included patients 18 years and older with a history of ventriculoperitoneal shunt insertion who presented to the emergency department with symptoms of shunt malfunction and underwent shunt series radiography and head CT within 12 hours. Shunt revision occurring contemporaneously with imaging was defined as revision within 48 hours of the original imaging report. The effective radiation dose was calculated by multiplying dose-length product from the scanner with the standard conversion coefficient k (k = 0.0021 mSv/mGy x cm). The turnaround time for patients who underwent both head CT and shunt series radiography was calculated from time of the first study to the time of completion of the last study. RESULTS. There were 16 shunt revisions in 239 patients. The sensitivity of CT was 87.5%; specificity, 91.4%; positive predictive value, 42.4%; and negative predictive value, 99%. The sensitivity of shunt series radiography was 18.7%; specificity, 90.9%; positive predictive value, 13%; and negative predictive value, 93.9%. There were 223 observations of CT radiation dose per patient (mean, 1.87 +/- 0.45). There also were 223 observations of shunt radiography radiation dose per patient (mean, 1.57 +/- 0.60). The median turnaround time among patients undergoing CT and shunt radiography was 109 +/- 84 minutes. CONCLUSION. Shunt series radiography is a low-yield diagnostic imaging modality for identifying shunt malfunction and prolongs turnaround time, increases medical cost, and exposes patients to unnecessary radiation. © American Roentgen Ray Society.",Excluded
405,"Efficacy of sucralfate ointment in the prevention of acute proctitis in cancer patients: A randomized controlled clinical trial Background: Acute radiation proctitis (ARP) is a usual adverse effect in patients undergoing pelvic radiotherapy. The symptoms include diarrhea, rectal blood or mucus discharge, fecal urgency and tenesmus with pain. Sucralfate, an aluminum-based salt of sucrose octasulfate, is a cytoprotective agent that forms a coating barrier at injured sites by adhering to mucoproteins. It has been used in topical management of a wide variety of local lesion. This study was designed to evaluate the preventive effect of rectal sucralfate on acute radiotherapy induced proctitis. Method(s): Seven percent sucralfate ointment was prepared for topical use. Drug quantification, chemical stability and microbial limit tests were performed carefully. In this randomized double blind placebo controlled trial, fifty-seven patients with pelvic malignancies undergoing radiotherapy were allocated to receive either 1 g of sucralfate or 1 g of placebo, given as a twice daily ointment, one day before and during radiotherapy for six weeks. The eligible patients were evaluated based on RTOG acute toxicity criteria and the following ARP symptoms weekly: Rectal hemorrhage, diarrhea, rectal pain, and fecal urgency. The influence of symptoms on lifestyle was also recorded weekly. Result(s): Acute proctitis was significantly less prevalent in patients in the sucralfate group. The incidence of rectal bleeding (P=0.003), diarrhea (P=0.002), rectal pain (P=<0.001) and fecal urgency (P=0.002) was significantly less common in the sucralfate group. No statistical significant difference was observed for radiotherapy induced cystitis in the placebo and sucralfate groups (P=0.27). Conclusion(s): This study suggests that sucralfate7% ointment reduces the incidence of symptoms associated with acute radiation proctitis.Copyright © 2020, Babol University of Medical Sciences.",Excluded

1872,"Which is the preferred modality of renal access for a trainee urologist: Ultrasonography or fluoroscopy? results of a prospective randomized trial Background and Purpose: In percutaneous nephrolithotomy (PCNL), placement of the access tract into the kidney is an important aspect of the procedure and is responsible for the steep learning curve associated with the operation. The aim of the current prospective randomized trial was to assess the duration of radiation exposure along with the safety and efficacy of PCNL done by a trainee, utilizing either ultrasonography (US) or fluoroscopic guidance to obtain access., Patients and Methods: Sixty-four patients with <=3cm renal calculi undergoing single-tract PCNL by trainee urologists (experience of <25 PCNL's) were randomized into US-and fluoroscopic-guided access groups (32 in each). In Group 1 (US guided), puncture was done using a 3.5/5MHz US probe with a puncture attachment, whereas the triangulation technique with biplanar C-arm fluoroscopy was utilized in group 2 (fluoroscopic guided). Patient demographics, stone parameters, intraoperative characteristics, fluoroscopy durations, and postoperative outcomes were analyzed., Results: Both groups were comparable as far as patient and stone characteristics were concerned. The fluoroscopy exposure during the puncture phase (T2) and overall (T) was significantly lower in the US group at 9.0+/-20.8 vs 43.8+/-34.8, (p<0.0001) and 204.3+/-84 vs 239.9+/-77.5, (p=0.04). Six patients in group1 required fluoroscopic adjustment (p=0.03). All other intra-and postoperative parameters were similar in both the groups. Conclusion(s): Both ultrasound and fluoroscopic guidance for renal access are equally safe and feasible in the hands of a trainee urologist. Total fluoroscopy duration and exposure time during puncture were both significantly less in the ultrasound group. Expertise in fluoroscopic-guided access is essential for a novice to effectively achieve access in all possible situations.Copyright © 2014, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.",Excluded

Thirty-six patients prospectively underwent noncontrast-enhanced CT calcium scoring followed by coronary CT angiography performed in dual-energy mode. By using different reconstruction algorithms, three VNC series were generated and evaluated for noise and efficiency of virtual iodine removal. Two readers independently quantified calcium on VNC images and true noncontrast-enhanced conventional calcium scoring series. A leave-one-out cross validation was used to assess the accuracy of calcium score prediction from VNC series by means of linear regression., RESULTS: CT value histograms of the VNC series closely resembled the profile in the true noncontrast-enhanced series. There was excellent correlation between calcium volumes on the VNC series and true noncontrast-enhanced series on a per-patient (r = 0.94, P < .001, n = 36) and per-vessel (r = 0.94, 0.91, and 0.92 for the three coronary arteries, all P < .001, n = 36 each) level. The ability of a linear regression model to predict actual calcium scores from calcium volumes on VNC series was excellent (r = 0.82). Multiethnic Study of Atherosclerosis rankings that were derived from the predicted calcium scores also showed excellent agreement (intraclass correlation coefficient = 0.909)., CONCLUSION: Coronary artery calcium identification and quantification based on dual-energy coronary CT angiographic studies may obviate the need for dedicated CT calcium scoring studies.

1125,"Diagnostic yield of CT pulmonary angiography for pulmonary embolism in clinically suspected patients ABSTRACT: Pulmonary embolism (PE) is a common medical problem. Its diagnostic criteria must be reviewed to determine the need for confirmatory testing. Computed tomography pulmonary angiography (CTPA) is the current standard of care, which provides accurate diagnosis with rapid turnaround. This study aimed to estimate the diagnostic yield of CTPA in clinically suspected PE patients in a tertiary care hospital in Saudi Arabia.Radiology records of all patients with clinically suspected PE who underwent CTPA between January 1, 2012 and September 30, 2018 were reviewed retrospectively. A radiologist with 10 years of professional experience interpreted and reported all cases. The Wells score with 2 tiers (likely and unlikely) was used to raise the clinical suspicion of PE.Positive results for PE were reported in 177 out of 534 clinically suspected cases (33%). Among the positive PE cases, 143 were acute (81%) and 34 (19%) were chronic. Bilateral, right-sided, and left-sided PE were found in 115 (65%), 37 (21%), and 25 (14%) cases, respectively. Involvement of the segmental branches, subsegmental branches, and the pulmonary trunk were noted in 152 (86%), 70 (40%), and 9 cases (5%), respectively. Saddle PE was found in (4%) of the cases. The lower lobe branches (right 55%, left 53%) and the upper lobe branches (right 47%, left 41%) were the most common sites of involvement.CTPA had a higher positive detection rate for PE among clinically suspected cases than its published diagnostic yield. Adequate clinical evaluation when selecting patients for CTPA is emphasized to minimize unjustified exposure of the patients to radiation and intravenous contrast administration. It is crucial for radiologists to provide detailed reports commenting on all relevant findings, including pertinent negatives. A template for reporting radiological findings for CTPA can be recommended for this purpose.Copyright © 2021 the Author(s). Published by Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.",Excluded
99,"Splinting the degenerative basal joint: Custom-made or prefabricated neoprene? The purpose of this study was to compare the objective, subjective, and radiographic responses of patients with carpometacarpal joint osteoarthritis (CMCJ-OA) wearing a prefabricated neoprene splint (PFN), which crosses the CMCJ and metacarpophalangeal joint, with those of patients wearing a custom-made thermoplastic short opponens splint (CMT), which crosses only the CMCJ. Patients (N = 25) with first CMCJ stage I and II osteoarthritis were assigned randomly to wear either the PFN splint or the CMT splint for one week. After one week, the subjects rated their function in the splint and their satisfaction and pain levels on visual analogue scales. Pinch measurements were performed and x-rays were taken to assess carpometacarpal subluxation. The second splint was then applied for one week and all measures were repeated. The subjects rated the PFN splint significantly higher, and most reported that they would choose the PFN splint over the CMT splint for daily and long-term use. Both pain and function were improved with splinting, but the effect was amplified with the PFN splint compared with the CMT splint. Both splints reduced subluxation at the first carpometacarpal joint, but the CMT effect was greater. This study further supports current evidence that subjects with stage I and II first CMCJ-OA will have pain relief with thumb splinting. In addition, the PFN splint will provide greater relief when compared with the CMT splint. Furthermore, this study reveals that patients prefer the PFN splint to the CMT splint.",Excluded
2220,"High dietary potassium intake as measured by 24-hour urine collection is associated with lower risk of ulcerative colitis Background: Recent animal studies have identified dietary salt intake as an environmental factor that may modify the risk and progression of autoimmune disorders through its effect on IL-23/Th-17 pathway. Because of the critical role of this pathway in pathogenesis of ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn's disease (CD), we sought to examine the association between pre-diagnosis mineral intakes measured by the gold standard, 24-hour urinary excretion, and subsequent risk of incident UC and CD. Method(s): We conducted a prospective case-control study nested among 1,487 women (median age = 65) enrolled in the Nurses' Health Study (NHS) I, 1,414 women (median age = 50) enrolled in the NHSII, and 1,136 men (median age = 63) enrolled in the Health Professional Follow up Study (HPFS) from whom we collected urine for 24 hours in 1995-1996. Diagnoses of incident CD and UC reported through 2009 in NHSII and 2010 in NHSI and HPFS were confirmed through review of medical records by two gastroenterologists. We documented 87 cases of UC and 50 cases of CD after urine collection. Urinary calcium and magnesium were measured by an atomic absorption spectrophotometer; urinary creatinine, uric acid, citrate, and phosphorus were measured by a Cobas centrifugal analyzer; urinary sodium and potassium were determined directly by flame emission photometry. The coefficients of variation for all analytes were <10%. We examined the association of each analyte according to quartile categories and as continuous variables using logistic regression models adjusting for age, cohort, BMI, and smoking to estimate relative risk (RR) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Result(s): The median prediagnostic 24-hour urinary potassium concentration was 60.5 mEq/ L among 87 UC cases; 60.9 ng/dl among 50 CD cases; and 62.9 mEq/L among 3,561 controls without UC or CD . Compared to participants in the lowest quartile of prediagnostic urinary potassium, the multivariate-adjusted RRs for UC were 0.98 (95% CI, 0.55-1.73) for the second quartile; 0.67 (95% CI, 0.35-1.28) for the third quartile; and 0.57 (0.28-1.16) for the highest quartile (Plinear trend = .03). In contrast, we did not observe any consistent association between prediagnostic urinary potassium and risk of CD (Plinear trend =.80). We did not observe any association between urinary sodium, creatinine, uric acid, citrate, or phosphorous and risk of UC or CD (all Plinear trends > .20). Conclusion : Dietary potassium intake as measured by 24 hour urinary potassium excretion is associated with a lower risk of UC but not CD. The recent observation that salt modifies the effect of critical immune mechanisms such as TH17/IL-23 pathway may underlie these findings. Future studies on the influence of intake of high potassium foods and supplements on the risk and progression of UC are warranted.",Excluded

The induction of chromosome aberrations in irradiated males Irradiated males were mated to females that had received treatment with caffeine or honey (by feeding), and the frequencies of sex chromosome losses and chromosome rearrangements induced in mature spermatozoa of the males were compared. Caffeine treatment led to an enhancement of the frequencies of sex chromosome loss and a decrease in those of rearrangements. These findings can be interpreted on the assumption that caffeine inhibits repair and misrepair processes that are active in the oocytes. Caffeine treatment administered to one of the female stocks used in these studies was without any effect, presumably because of the absence of a caffeine sensitive repair mechanism in the oocytes.",Excluded
3093,"Critical analysis of lumbar interspinous devices failures: A retrospective study Interspinous devices (IDs) were introduced in the 90s. Since then, they have rapidly become very popular for the minimally invasive treatment of lumbar pain disorders. They feature different shapes and biomechanical characteristics, and are used in the spine degenerative pathologies or as motion segment stabilizers (dynamic stabilization) or to obtain the decompression of neurological structures. The indications seem to be rather narrow and still to be verified in terms of their clinical efficacy. However, IDs are being extensively utilized beyond their classical indications with the inevitable risk of a clinical failure. The aim of the present work was to carry out a critical analysis of the causes of failure in a series of 19 patients. From January 2007 to March 2009, 19 patients with residual painful syndrome after the implantation of IDs were observed. The series includes 11 males and 8 females with a mean age of 53.6 years (range 38-84 years) who were operated on elsewhere and who underwent revision surgery at our hospital. The inclusion criteria were low back pain and/or radiculopathy after the device implantation without improvement of the painful symptomatology, radiculopathy with signs of sensory and motor deficit, intermittent neurogenic claudication, and infection. All patients were thoroughly re-assessed with new standard imaging examinations such as MRI and CT scans, considering the following image features: the position of the device with respect to the spinous processes (X-ray), the intervertebral disc disease of the level operated upon or of the adjacent levels (MRI), the segmental instability (dynamic X-rays), the severity of the canal stenosis (CT). The accurate evaluation of the clinical and imaging parameters revealed three main causes of failure: errors of indication, technical errors and the structural failure of the ID. The most frequent cause of failure was a wrong indication. The results of the study are presented and the causes of failure are discussed in detail. © 2011 Springer-Verlag.",Excluded
2703,"Higher dose rate Gamma Knife radiosurgery may provide earlier and longer-lasting pain relief for patients with trigeminal neuralgia Object Gamma Knife radiosurgery (GKRS) utilizes cobalt-60 as its radiation source, and thus dose rate varies as the fixed source decays over its half-life of approximately 5.26 years. This natural decay results in increasing treatment times when delivering the same cumulative dose. It is also possible, however, that the biological effective dose may change based on this dose rate even if the total dose is kept constant. Because patients are generally treated in a uniform manner, radiosurgery for trigeminal neuralgia (TN) represents a clinical model whereby biological efficacy can be tested. The authors hypothesized that higher dose rates would result in earlier and more complete pain relief but only if measured with a sensitive pain assessment tool. Methods One hundred thirty-three patients were treated with the Gamma Knife Model 4C unit at a single center by a single neurosurgeon during a single cobalt life cycle from January 2006 to May 2012. All patients were treated with 80 Gy with a single 4-mm isocenter without blocking. Using an output factor of 0.87, dose rates ranged from 1.28 to 2.95 Gy/min. The Brief Pain Inventory (BPI)-Facial was administered before the procedure and at the first follow-up office visit 1 month from the procedure (mean 1.3 months). Phone calls were made to evaluate patients after their procedures as part of a retrospective study. Univariate and multivariate linear regression was performed on several independent variables, including sex, age in deciles, diagnosis, follow-up duration, prior surgery, and dose rate. Results In the short-term analysis (mean 1.3 months), patients' self-reported pain intensity at its worst was significantly correlated with dose rate on multivariate analysis (p = 0.028). Similarly, patients' self-reported interference with activities of daily living was closely correlated with dose rate on multivariate analysis (p = 0.067). A 1 Gy/min decrease in dose rate resulted in a 17% decrease in pain intensity at its worst and a 22% decrease in pain interference with activities of daily living. In longer-term follow-up (mean 1.9 years), GKRS with higher dose rates (> 2.0 Gy/min; p = 0.007) and older age in deciles (p = 0.012) were associated with a lower likelihood of recurrence of pain. Discussion Prior studies investigating the role of dose rate in Gamma Knife radiosurgical ablation for TN have not used validated outcome tools to measure pain preoperatively. Consequently, differences in pain outcomes have been difficult to measure. By administering pain scales both preoperatively as well as postoperatively, the authors have identified statistically significant differences in pain intensity and pain interference with activities of daily living when comparing higher versus lower dose rates. Radiosurgery with a higher dose rate results in more pain relief at the early follow-up evaluation, and it may result in a lower recurrence rate at later follow-up.Copyright © AANS, 2015.",Excluded
868,"Toxicity Related to Radiotherapy Dose and Targeting Strategy: A Pooled Analysis of Cooperative Group Trials of Combined Modality Therapy for Locally Advanced Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer OBJECTIVE: Concurrent chemoradiotherapy (CRT) was the standard treatment for locally advanced NSCLC (LA-NSCLC). This study was performed to examine thoracic radiotherapy (TRT) parameters and their impact on adverse events (AEs)., METHODS: We collected individual patient data from 3600 patients with LA-NSCLC who participated in 16 cooperative group trials of concurrent CRT. The TRT parameters examined included field design strategy (elective nodal irradiation [ENI] versus involved-field [IF] TRT [IF-TRT]) and TRT dose (60 Gy versus >=60 Gy). The primary end point of this analysis was the occurrence of AEs. ORs for AEs were calculated with univariable and multivariable logistic models., RESULTS: TRT doses ranged from 60 to 74 Gy. ENI was not associated with more grade 3 or higher AEs than IF-TRT was (multivariable OR = 0.77, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.543-1.102, p = 0.1545). Doses higher than 60 Gy (high-dose TRT) were associated with significantly more grade 3 or higher AEs (multivariable OR = 1.82, 95% CI: 1.501-2.203, p < 0.0001). In contrast, ENI was associated with significantly more grade 4 or higher AEs (multivariable OR = 1.33, 95% CI: 1.035-1.709, p = 0.0258). Doses higher than 60 Gy were also associated with more grade 4 or higher AEs (multivariate OR = 1.42, 95% CI: 1.191-1.700, p = 0.0001). Grade 5 AEs plus treatment-related deaths were more frequent with higher-dose TRT (p = 0.0012) but not ENI (p = 0.099)., CONCLUSIONS: For patients with LA-NSCLC treated with concurrent CRT, IF-TRT was not associated with the overall risk of grade 3 or higher AEs but was associated with significantly fewer grade 4 or higher AEs than ENI TRT. This is likely the result of irradiation of a lesser amount of adjacent critical normal tissue. Higher TRT doses were associated significantly with grade 3 or higher and grade 4 or higher AEs. On the basis of these findings and our prior report on survival, CRT using IF-TRT and 60 Gy (conventionally fractionated) were associated with more favorable patient survival and less toxicity than was the use of ENI or higher radiotherapy doses.

3372,"A study of middle ear function in the treatment of nasopharyngeal carcinoma with IMRT technique PURPOSE: This study evaluates the difference in damage to middle ear function with CRT and IMRT techniques in the treatment of nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC). We explore the isthmus of the Eustachian tube (ET) as the key anatomic site for the prevention of radiation-induced otitis media with effusion., METHODS AND MATERIALS: Eighty-two patients with NPC were divided into two groups: 40 patients treated with CRT and 42 patients treated with IMRT. The difference between dosage over the middle ear cavity and the isthmus of the ET was evaluated in both CRT group and IMRT group. All patients underwent hearing tests including pure tone audiometry and impedance audiometry before and after RT., RESULTS: The dosage difference to the middle ear cavity and isthmus between these two groups was statistically significant (p<0.05). The difference in hearing test results between these two groups was also statistically significant (p<0.05). If we limited the dose to the middle ear cavity under 34 Gy and the dose to the isthmus under 53 Gy with IMRT, we may decrease radiation-induced OME even with the larger 2.25 Gy fraction size., CONCLUSIONS: IMRT may have better protected the middle ear function compared with the CRT technique, even with larger fraction sizes than for the conventional CRT technique.",Excluded
3192,"Site-specific cancer incidence and mortality after cerebral angiography with radioactive thorotrast Few opportunities exist to evaluate the carcinogenic effects of long-term internal exposure to alpha-particle-emitting radionuclides. Patients injected with Thorotrast (thorium-232) during radiographic procedures, beginning in the 1930s, provide one such valuable opportunity. We evaluated site-specific cancer incidence and mortality among an international cohort of 3,042 patients injected during cerebral angiography with either Thorotrast (n = 1,650) or a nonradioactive agent (n = 1,392) and who survived 2 or more years. Standardized incidence ratios (SIR) for Thorotrast and comparison patients (Denmark and Sweden) were estimated and relative risks (RR), adjusted for population, age and sex, were generated with multivariate statistical modeling. For U.S. patients, comparable procedures were used to estimate standardized mortality ratios (SMR) and RR, representing the first evaluation of long-term, site-specific cancer mortality in this group. Compared with nonexposed patients, significantly increased risks in Thorotrast patients were observed for all incident cancers combined (RR = 3.4, 95% CI 2.9-4.1, n = 480, Denmark and Sweden) and for cancer mortality (RR = 4.0, 95% CI 2.5-6.7, n = 114, U.S.). Approximately 335 incident cancers were above expectation, with large excesses seen for cancers of the liver, bile ducts and gallbladder (55% or 185 excess cancers) and leukemias other than CLL (8% or 26 excess cancers). The RR of all incident cancers increased with time since angiography (P < 0.001) and was threefold at 40 or more years; significant excesses (SIR = 4.0) persisted for 50 years. Increasing cumulative dose of radiation was associated with an increasing risk of all incident cancers taken together and with cancers of the liver, gallbladder, and peritoneum and other digestive sites; similar findings were observed for U.S. cancer mortality. A marginally significant dose response was observed for the incidence of pancreas cancer (P = 0.05) but not for lung cancer. Our study confirms the relationship between Thorotrast and increased cancer incidence at sites of Thorotrast deposition and suggests a possible association with pancreas cancer. After injection with >20 ml Thorotrast, the cumulative excess risk of cancer incidence remained elevated for up to 50 years and approached 97%. Caution is needed in interpreting the excess risks observed for site-specific cancers, however, because of the potential bias associated with the selection of cohort participants, noncomparability with respect to the internal or external comparison groups, and confounding by indication. Nonetheless, the substantial risks associated with liver cancer and leukemia indicate that unique and prolonged exposure to alpha-particle-emitting Thorotrast increased carcinogenic risks.",Excluded
3567,"Potential Functional Variants in DNA Repair Genes Are Associated with Efficacy and Toxicity of Radiotherapy in Patients with Non-Small-Cell Lung Cancer Background. Lung cancer is one of the leading causes of cancer-related deaths. Radiotherapy, either alone or with chemotherapy, is still the primary treatment for patients with non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). There are variations in how patients with NSCLC respond to radiotherapy and how toxic the therapy is. DNA repair gene polymorphisms are related to cancer development; however, their association with radiotherapy outcomes remains unknown. We hypothesized that gDNA repair gene variation could affect the efficacy and toxicity of radiotherapy in patients with NSCLC. Methods. A total of 486 histologically confirmed patients with NSCLC were recruited from the Shengjing Hospital of China Medical University from July 2015 to September 2019. Eleven potentially functional single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in four DNA repair genes (XRCC1, XRCC2, XPD, and MSH2) were genotyped in these patients. A multiple factor logistic regression analysis was used to assess the association between these SNPs and the efficacy and toxicity of radiotherapy. Results. Three SNPs, rs25487 (XRCC1), rs3218556 (XRCC2), and rs13181 (XPD), were all significantly associated with the efficacy of radiotherapy. The allele frequencies of the rs25487 CC genotype (OR = 0.457, 95% CI = 0.259-0.804, p=0.006) and the rs3218556 AG or AA genotypes (AG genotype: OR = 0.664, 95% CI = 0.442-0.999, p=0.049; AA genotype: OR = 0.380, 95% CI = 0.181-0.795, p=0.008) were both significantly higher in the response group than in the nonresponse group. For rs13181, the radiotherapy efficacy was associated with the heterozygous genotype GT (OR = 1.663, 95% CI = 1.057-2.614,p=0.027). Statistically significant associations between radiation-induced toxic reactions and rs25487 (XRCC1), rs3218556 (XRCC2), and rs13181 (XPD) were also observed. The rs13181GT genotype was associated with lower toxic reactions than the TT genotype (OR = 1.680, 95% CI = 1.035-2.728,p=0.035). Conclusions. The variants rs25487 (XRCC1), rs3218556 (XRCC2), and rs13181 (XPD) all contribute to the efficacy and toxicity of radiotherapy in patients with NSCLC. Our findings may clarify the predictive value of DNA repair genes for prognosis in patients with NSCLC after radiotherapy. Further investigation of more genes and samples should be performed to confirm our findings.Copyright © 2020 Zhiguang Yang and Zhaoyu Liu.",Excluded
1992,"Diagnostic Accuracy of Fluoroscopy, Radiography, and Computed Tomography in Detecting Cement Leakage in Kyphoplasty Purpose Cement leakage is a typical complication of kyphoplasty for vertebral fractures. It is unclear if cement application intraoperatively can be improved by using other techniques of visualization and which kind of postoperative imaging should be recommended to detect cement extravasation accurately. Objective To compare the rates of cement leakage detected by intraoperative fluoroscopy, postoperative radiography, and postoperative computed tomography (CT) in a retrospective study. Patients and Methods The study included 78 patients (60 women and 18 men; 115 vertebral bodies) who were treated with two kinds of kyphoplasty. The patients underwent intraoperative fluoroscopy and postoperative radiography and CT. After surgery, the images were evaluated to compare cement leakage rates and locations in the three visualization techniques. Leakage locations were described as epidural, intradiskal, extravertebral, or intravascular. Results Compared with CT, intraoperative fluoroscopy regularly detected intradiskal leakage (75%) but had a considerably lower sensitivity for visualizing epidural (21%), extravertebral (31%), and intravascular (51%) cement leakages. A comparison of radiography and CT showed that radiography had a high sensitivity for detecting intradiskal (82%) and intravascular (70%) cement extrusions but a lower sensitivity in identifying epidural (42%) and extravertebral (50%) leaks. Therefore, the CT scan overall was best in detecting location and accuracy. Conclusion CT detected more cement leaks than any of the other investigated techniques, especially epidural, extravertebral, and intravascular cement leakages. To achieve the best accuracy, only CT provides complete information.Copyright © 2018 Georg Thieme Verlag KG Stuttgart - New York.",Excluded
3129,"Radiation-induced micro-RNA expression changes in peripheral blood cells of radiotherapy patients Purpose: MicroRNAs (miRNAs), a class of noncoding small RNAs that regulate gene expression, are involved in numerous physiologic processes in normal and malignant cells. Our in vivo study measured miRNA and gene expression changes in human blood cells in response to ionizing radiation, to develop miRNA signatures that can be used as biomarkers for radiation exposure. Methods and Materials: Blood from 8 radiotherapy patients in complete remission 1 or 2 was collected immediately before and 4 hours after total body irradiation with 1.25 Gy x-rays. Both miRNA and gene expression changes were measured by means of quantitative polymerase chain reaction and microarray hybridization, respectively. Hierarchic clustering, multidimensional scaling, class prediction, and gene ontology analysis were performed to investigate the potential of miRNAs to serve as radiation biomarkers and to elucidate their likely physiologic roles in the radiation response. Result(s): The expression levels of 45 miRNAs were statistically significantly upregulated 4 hours after irradiation with 1.25 Gy x-rays, 27 of them in every patient. Nonirradiated and irradiated samples form separate clusters in hierarchic clustering and multidimensional scaling. Out of 223 differentially expressed genes, 37 were both downregulated and predicted targets of the upregulated miRNAs. Paired and unpaired miRNA-based classifiers that we developed can predict the class membership of a sample with unknown irradiation status, with accuracies of 100% when all 45 upregulated miRNAs are included. Both miRNA control of and gene involvement in biologic processes such as hemopoiesis and the immune response are increased after irradiation, whereas metabolic processes are underrepresented among all differentially expressed genes and the genes controlled by miRNAs. Conclusion(s): Exposure to ionizing radiation leads to the upregulation of the expression of a considerable proportion of the human miRNAome of peripheral blood cells. These miRNA expression signatures can be used as biomarkers of radiation exposure. © 2011 Elsevier Inc.",Excluded

In addition, results of outcomes after repeat ablation in the elderly are lacking. We report the results of first repeat AF ablation procedures of aged patients from a real-world multicenter prospective registry. Method(s): Patients undergoing second AF ablation included in the prospective, multicenter German Ablation Registry were divided in two groups (age > 70 years (group 1) and age <= 70 years (group 2)) and analyzed for procedural characteristics and clinical follow-up. Result(s): 738 patients were analyzed (108 patients in group 1, 630 patients in group 2). Significantly more aged patients had structural heart disease (56 patients (51.9%) vs. 203 patients (32.2%), p < 0.001). The majority of the patients underwent repeat pulmonary vein isolation (101 patients (93.5%) vs. 593 patients (94.1%), p = 0.98). More aged patients underwent ablation of left atrial linear lesions (78.1% vs. 57.3% of all linear lesions, p = 0.027). There was no difference in the occurrence of peri-procedural complications (7 patients (6.5%) vs. 24 patients (3.8%), p = 0.30). Recurrence of atrial arrhythmias was documented in 45/105 (42.9%) and 252/603 (41.8%) patients with available follow-up in groups 1 and 2 after a median of 447 (400; 532) and 473 (411; 544) days (p = 0.84). A comparable amount of patients were asymptomatic or reported symptom improvement after repeat ablation in both groups (80% (80/100) in group 1 and 77% (446/576) in group 2; p = 0.57).

2824,"The association between chronic kidney disease and cardiovascular disease risk factors in atomic bomb survivors Atomic bomb (A-bomb) radiation is associated with cardiovascular disease (CVD) and metabolic CVD risk factors. Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is also known to be a risk factor for CVD and little is known whether CKD is associated with A-bomb radiation. To examine whether CKD is associated with CVD risk factors or with A-bomb radiation in A-bomb survivors, we classified renal dysfunction in 1,040 A-bomb survivors who were examined in 2004-2007 as normal [n = 121; estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) >= 90 ml/min/1.73 m(2)]; mild (n = 686; eGFR 60-89 ml/min/1.73 m(2)); moderate (n = 217; eGFR 30-59 ml/min/1.73 m(2)); or severe (n = 16; eGFR <30 ml/min/1.73 m(2)). Also, we diagnosed subjects in the moderate and severe renal dysfunction groups as having CKD (n = 233; eGFR <59 ml/min/1.73 m(2)). After adjusting for age, gender, and smoking and drinking habits, we looked for an association between renal dysfunction and hypertension, diabetes mellitus (DM), hyperlipidemia, and metabolic syndrome (MetS), and between renal dysfunction and A-bomb radiation. Hypertension [odds ratio (OR), 1.57; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.12-2.20, P = 0.009]; DM (OR, 1.79; 95% CI, 1.23-2.61, P = 0.002); hyperlipidemia (OR, 1.55; 95% CI, 1.12-2.14, P = 0.008); and MetS (OR, 1.86; 95% CI, 1.32-2.63, P < 0.001) were associated with CKD (moderate/severe renal dysfunction), and hyperlipidemia and MetS were also associated with mild renal dysfunction. CKD (OR/Gy, 1.29; 95% CI, 1.01-1.63, P = 0.038) and severe renal dysfunction (OR/Gy, 3.19; 95% CI, 1.63-6.25, P < 0.001) were significantly associated with radiation dose.

2595,"Oxygen consumption during walking and running under fractional weight bearing conditions INTRODUCTION: Knowledge of changes in oxygen consumption during reduced body weight loading at different speed levels is important, in particular in astronauts who may lose aerobic fitness as well as in clinical patients (e.g., in obese individuals at walking speeds or in injured athletes at running speeds). Therefore, the aim of this study was to analyze oxygen consumption during unloaded walking and running., METHODS: Oxygen consumption (Vo2), heart rate (HR), and Borg rating of perceived exertion (Borg RPE) were quantified in 10 healthy young female and male volunteers at 3 body weight (BW) conditions (100%, 66%, and 33% BW) and 4 treadmill speeds (slow walking at 0.4 m x s(-1), comfortable walking at 1.3 m x s(-1), slow running at 2.2 m x s(-1), and moderately fast running at 3.1 m x s(-1)). Unloading was achieved in a waist-high chamber with increased pressure called Lower Body Positive Pressure (LBPP)., RESULTS: All parameters (Vo2, HR, and Borg RPE) decreased during unloaded walking and running. Interestingly, our findings confirm a specific linear relationship between each parameter and treadmill speed for each BW condition with smaller slope angles at higher levels of unloading (e.g., for Vo2, the slope angle decreased from 11.9 at 100% BW to 4.4 at 33% BW)., DISCUSSION: Oxygen consumption, heart rate, and Borg rating of perceived exertion are reduced during unloaded exercise with a relatively greater decline at higher treadmill speeds. That is, the higher the treadmill's speed in unloaded conditions, the relatively ""easier"" it is to exercise.",Excluded

The nanoparticles were characterized by ultraviolet-visible spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction, field emission electron microscopic scanning mansoni (FESEM), and dynamic light scattering (DLS). For the in vitro test with Schistosoma mansoni, the DNHK-loaded PLGA was diluted into the medium, and added at concentrations 10-200 microM to the culture medium containing one adult worm pair. The parasites were kept for 120 h and monitored every 24 h to evaluate their general condition, including: pairing, alterations in motor activity and mortality., RESULTS: The loaded PLGA nanoparticles gave an encapsulation efficiency of 42.2% and showed spherical characteristics in monodisperse polymeric matrix. The adult worm pairs were separated after 120 h of incubation for concentrations higher than 50 microM of DNHK-loaded PLGA.

Materials/Methods: This retrospective review enrolled 43 consecutive patients with T2N0 larynx cancer treated with definitive TLM (n = 25) or CCRT (n = 18) between 2005 and 2012. The tumor was located in the supraglottis in 9 patients, glottis in 31 patients, and subglottis in 3 patients. The mean cumulative radiation doses were 70 Gy for CCRT group and Cisplatin-based concurrent chemotherapies were the most commonly used regimens. Oncological outcomes were evaluated using local control (LC), regional control (RC), larynx preservation survival (LPS), disease free survival (DFS), cancer specific survival (CSS), and overall survival (OS). Result(s): The median follow-up time was 3.93 years for the survivors. Patients' characteristics between two groups had no statistically significant difference. The 5-year LRC rate for CCRT group was 94.4% significantly higher than the 64.1% for TLM group (p = 0.030). The 5-year DFS rate for CCRT group was significantly improved (78.5% vs 56.5%, p=0.040). There was no significant difference in LPS, CSS, and OS. The most significant risk factor for tumor recurrence was subglottic invasion with significantly poor 5-year LRC rate (50.9% vs 92.7%, p = 0.003). On multivariate analysis, subglottic invasion was the only significant factor predicting recurrence after definitive treatment. Conclusion(s): TLM and CCRT are both effective in terms of larynx preservation survival rate for T2N0 larynx cancer. However, CCRT may improve the local regional control and disease free survival rate. Tumor with subglottic invasion carries poor prognostic value for tumor control, further adjuvant therapy may be considered.",Excluded
366,"A Pilot Study of Safer Radiation Dosage to the Heart and Its Subregions Background and Objectives: The real impact of ionizing radiation on the heart and poorer overall survival for patients with non small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) remains unclear. This study aims to determine the safe dose constraints to the heart's subregions that could prevent patients' early non-cancerous death and improve their quality of life. Methods and Materials: A retrospective cohort study was performed containing 51 consecutive patients diagnosed with stage III NSCLC and treated using 3D, Intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT), and Volumetric modulated arc therapy (VMAT) radiotherapy. For a dosimetric analysis, these structures were chosen: heart, heart base (HB), and region of great blood vessels (GBV). Dose-volume histograms (DVH) were recorded for all mentioned structures. Maximum and mean doses to the heart, HB, the muscle mass of the HB, and GBV were obtained. V10-V60 (%) parameters were calculated from the DVH. After performed statistical analysis, logistic regression models were created, and critical doses calculated. Result(s): The critical dose for developing a fatal endpoint for HB was 30.5 Gy, while for GBV, it was 46.3 Gy. Increasing the average dose to the HB or GBV by 1 Gy from the critical dose further increases the possibility of early death by 22.0% and 15.8%, respectively. Conclusion(s): We suggest that the non-canonical sub-regions of the heart (HB and GBV) should be considered during the planning stage. Additional constraints of the heart subregions should be chosen accordingly, and we propose that the mean doses to these regions be 30.5 Gy and 46.3 Gy, respectively, or less.

Then the thymus were taken out after the mice were decapitated. Thymus index, morphological characteristics of thymus were examined. The changes of thymus T-cell subgroups, cell cycle progression in thymocytes and cellular apoptosis were detected with flow cytometry (FCM). RESULT(S): The body weights of animals in 5, 15 mW/cm(2) irradiation groups [(28.10 +/- 1.46), (27.50 +/- 2.52) g] were lower than that of the control [(31.95 +/- 2.51) g] (P < 0.05). Pathological observation showed dark red piece of nucleus, some nuclei inclined to one side, slight increase in hassall body. The expressions of CD8 in 5, 15 mW/cm(2) irradiation groups (29.14% +/- 1.68%, 29.18% +/- 0.81%) were higher than that in control group (26.95% +/- 1.27%) (P < 0.05). The percentages of G(2) + M phase thymocytes in both radiation groups (12.24% +/- 1.82%, 11.19% +/- 1.36%) were lower than that in control group (14.58% +/- 0.64%) (P < 0.01).

993,"Magnetic resonance enterocolonography is useful for simultaneous evaluation of small and large intestinal lesions in Crohn's disease BACKGROUND: We developed novel magnetic resonance enterocolonography (MREC) for simultaneously evaluating both small and large bowel lesions in patients with Crohn's disease (CD). The aim of this study was to evaluate the diagnostic performance of MREC by comparing results of this procedure to those of endoscopies for evaluating the small and large bowel lesions of patients with CD., METHODS: Thirty patients with established CD were prospectively examined by newly developed MREC. Patients underwent ileocolonoscopy (ICS) (24 procedures) or double-balloon endoscopy (DBE) (10 procedures) after MREC on the same day. Two gastroenterologists and two radiologists who were blinded to the results of another study evaluated endoscopy and MREC findings, respectively., RESULTS: In colonic lesions the sensitivities of the MREC for deep mucosal lesions (DML), all CD lesions, and stenosis were 88.2, 61.8, and 71.4%, respectively, while the specificities were 98.1, 95.3, and 97.7%, respectively. In small intestinal lesions, MREC sensitivities for DML, all CD lesions, and stenosis were 100, 85.7, and 100%, respectively, while specificities were 100, 90.5, and 93.1%, respectively. Endoscopic scores were significantly correlated with MREC scores. Eleven (46%) of the 24 patients who were clinically not suspected to show stricture were observed to demonstrate stricture by radiologists., CONCLUSIONS: Our results demonstrated that MREC can simultaneously detect the CD lesions of the small and large intestine. MREC can be performed without radiation exposure, the use of enema, or the placement of a naso-jejunal catheter. MREC and endoscopy have comparable abilities for evaluating mucosal lesions of patients with CD. Copyright © 2010 Crohn's & Colitis Foundation of America, Inc.",Excluded

PG massage can be applied to thyroid cancer patients who receive radioiodine therapy to reduce PG dysfunction., Background To prevent salivary dysfunction in thyroid cancer patients who have undergone radioiodine ablation, massaging the parotid gland (PG) is presumed to be helpful for the removal of radioiodine. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effect of PG massage in the removal of radioiodine from the PG Nucl Med Commun 35:1127-1131, Methods Forty-four patients (female, 38; 49.1+/- 11.0 years) who underwent total thyroidectomy followed by I-131 ablation were included in this prospective study. Three serial salivary gland scans were performed 2 h after administration of I-123 in thyroid hormone withdrawal status. The patients were divided into two groups. There was a 1-min (or 2-min) interval between the first and second scans for control, followed by the performance of PG massage for 1 min (or 2 min) between the second and third scans. Changes in uptakes were calculated between the first and second scans (control) and between the second and third scans (massage).Copyright © 2014 Wolters Kluwer Health Lippincott Williams & Wilkins.",Excluded

While the efficacy of PUVA with oral 8-methoxypsoralen (8-MOP) is well documented, the use of its topical variation, bath-water PUVA therapy with 8-MOP has not been studied. The purpose of this study was to assess the effect of 8-MOP bath-water PUVA therapy in adult patients with early stage mycosis fungoides. We retrospectively evaluated the outcomes of bath-water delivery of 8-MOP (1 mg l(-1)) in 16 patients with early stage mycosis fungoides. In all patients complete response was achieved after a mean duration of 63 days requiring 29 treatments and a mean cumulative UVA dose of 33 J cm(-2). The time to relapse after complete clinical clearance was 45.6 (+/-9.2) weeks. In comparison, oral PUVA therapy with 8-MOP resulted in complete response after 64.5 days (25.8 treatments) with a mean relapse-free period of 30 (+/-3.5) weeks.

3354,"Effects of beta radiation from organically bound tritium on cultured mouse embryonic mid brain cells Effects of beta radiation from four kinds of organically bound tritium compounds were investigated on cultured mouse embryonic mid brain cells, isolated from 11-d-old mouse embryos. The MBC showed a critical time when they were more radiosensitive. Although dose-dependent inhibition was found for both cellular proliferation and differentiation, the differentiation was more sensitive to radiation than proliferation when compared at ID50, the inhibitory dose that reduced assessment value by 50% of the control. Dose-dependent decrease of DNA and protein contents were also observed. The relative biological effectiveness values, ranging from 4.6 to 8.7, of beta ray from organically bound tritium compounds were obtained when compared with x irradiation at their ID50s on the inhibition of cell proliferation and differentiation, and on the decrease of DNA and protein contents of the cultures. The mixed exposure to x ray and one kind of organically bound tritium compound or to any two kinds of organically bound tritium compound resulted in a more efficiently inhibitory effect on differentiation than the exposure to x ray or to any one kind of organically bound tritium compound alone, especially when methyl-3H-thymidine was used.

3044,"Effect of fluoroscopic X-rays combined with iodinated radiographic contrast media on human hematological parameters Introduction: Fluoroscopic X-rays are widely used for examinations around the world. Technicians often use an iodinated radiographic contrast media during fluoroscopic X-ray examinations. Objective(s): This study examined the impact on hematological parameters for human blood and morphology of red blood cells that were exposed to fluoroscopic X-ray combined with iodinated radiographic contrast media, i.e., iopromid, iohexol, and iodixanol. Method(s): Blood samples from male and female subjects were incubated with 5 mgI/mL of iodinated radiographic contrast media for 5 min, then were irradiated using fluoroscopic X-rays (70 kV, 0.8 mA) for 10, 30, and 60 min. Hematological parameters of the blood samples were determined by a clinical service center, and morphology of red blood cells was examined by light microscope. Comparison of mean values of hematological parameters based on the student's t-tests between irradiated blood alone, iodinated radiographic contrast media-incubated blood alone, and combination-exposed blood to each corresponding control blood was performed. Result(s): These data showed no change in the hematological parameters and morphology of red blood cells in irradiated blood alone, iodinated radiographic contrast media-incubated blood alone, and combination-exposed blood in both male and female subjects when compared to control blood at all fluoroscopic X-ray times. Conclusion(s): These finding suggested that there were no harmful effects following fluoroscopic X-rays combined with iodinated radiographic contrast media when human blood was irradiated in an in vitro condition.Copyright © 2021, Korean Society of Environmental Risk Assessment and Health Science.",Included

Patients and Methods: We retrospectively analyzed 30 patients with EHBD adenocarcinoma who underwent chemoradiotherapy after palliative resection (R2 resection). Postoperative radiotherapy was delivered to the tumor bed including residual tumor and regional lymph nodes (range=40-55.8 Gy). Most patients underwent chemoradiotherapy concurrently with 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) or gemcitabine. Result(s): The 2-year locoregional progression-free, distant metastasis-free and overall survival rates were 33.3%, 42.4% and 44.5%, respectively. High radiation dose >=50 Gy had a marginally significant impact on superior locoregional progression-free survival compared to 40 Gy (p=0.081).

2379,"Definitive high-dose photon/proton radiotherapy for unresected mobile spine and sacral chordomas Study Design.: A retrospective review. Objective.: The purpose of this study is to report the results of high-dose proton based definitive radiotherapy for unresected spinal chordomas. Summary of Background Data.: Spine chordoma is treated primarily by surgical resection. However, local recurrence rate is high. Adjuvant radiotherapy improves local control. In certain locations, such as high sacrum, resection may result in significant neurological dysfunction. Methods.: We retrospectively reviewed 24 patients with newly diagnosed, previously untreated spinal chordomas (core biopsy only; no prior incision or resection) treated with high-dose definitive radiotherapy alone using protons and photons at our center from 1988 to 2009. Results.: Reasons for radiotherapy alone included medical inoperability (3) and concern for neurological dysfunction based on spine level (21). Median age was 69.5 years. Tumor locations included cervical (2), thoracic (1), lumbar (2), S1-S2 (17), and S3 or below (2). Median maximal tumor diameter was 6.6 cm (1.4-25.5), and median tumor volume was 198.3 cm (4.65-2061). Median total dose was 77.4 GyRBE (proton dose unit, gray relative biological effectiveness). Analysis at median follow-up of 56 months showed overall survival of 91.7% and 78.1%, chordoma specific survival of 95.7% and 81.5%, local progression free survival of 90.4% and 79.8% and metastases free survival of 86.5% and 76.3%, at 3 and 5 years respectively. Tumor volume more than 500 cm was correlated with worse overall survival. Long-term side effects included 8 sacral insufficiency fractures (none required surgical stabilization), 1 secondary malignancy, 1 foot drop, 1 erectile dysfunction, 1 perineal numbness, 2 worsening urinary/fecal incontinence, and 4 grade-2 rectal bleeding. None required new colostomy. All surviving patients remained ambulatory. Conclusion.: These results support the use of high-dose definitive radiotherapy for patients with medically inoperable or otherwise unresected, mobile spine or sacrococcygeal chordomas.

2994,"Cumulative radiation dose from medical imaging procedures in patients undergoing resection for lung cancer Background: Radiation dose from diagnostic imaging procedures is not monitored in patients undergoing surgery for lung cancer. Evidence suggests an increased lifetime risk of malignancy of 1.0% per 100 millisieverts (mSv). As such, recommendations are to restrict healthcare and radiation workers to a maximum dose of 50 mSv per year or to 100 mSv over a three-year period. The purpose of this study was to estimate cumulative effective doses of radiation in patients undergoing lung cancer resection and to determine predictors of increased exposure. Method(s): We identified 94 consecutive patients undergoing resection for non-small cell lung cancer. Radiologic procedures performed from one year prior to resection until two years postresection were recorded. Estimates of effective doses (mSv) were obtained from published literature and institutional records. Predictors of dose greater than 50 mSv per year and greater than 100 mSv per three years were examined statistically. Result(s): The majority of patients (median age = 67 years) had stage IA cancer (52%). In the three-year period, patients had 1,958 radiologic studies (20.8/patient) including 398 computed tomographic (CT) scans (4.23/patient) and 211 positron emission tomography (PET) scans (2.24 per patient). The three-year median estimated radiation dose was 84.0 mSv (interquartile range, 44.1 to 123.2 mSv). The highest dose was in the preoperative year. In any one year, 66% of patients received more than 50 mSv, while 19% received over 100 mSv. Over the three-year period, 43.6% of patients exceeded 100 mSv. The majority of the radiation (89.8%) was from CT or PET scans. On multivariate analysis, a history of previous malignancy (odds ratio [OR] 3.8; confidence interval [CI] 1.14 to 12.7), postoperative complications (OR 6.16; CI 1.42 to 26.6), and postoperative surveillance with PET-CT (OR 13.2; CI 4.34 to 40.3) predicted exposure greater than 100 mSv over the three-year period. Conclusion(s): This study demonstrates that lung cancer patients often receive a higher dose of radiation than that considered safe for healthcare and radiation workers. The median cumulative dose reported in this study could potentially increase the individual estimated lifetime cancer risk by as much as 0.8%. Although risk-benefit considerations are clearly different between these groups, strategies should be in place to decrease radiation doses during the preoperative workup and postoperative period. © 2011 The Society of Thoracic Surgeons.",Excluded

909,"Evaluation of focal thyroid lesions incidentally detected in F- 18 fluorodeoxyglucose PET/CT images AIM: Increased uptake in the thyroid gland (TG) is often identified as an incidental finding on whole-body F-18 Fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography/computed tomography (FDG-PET/CT) in the non-thyroid cancer (NTC) patients. Currently, there is no consensus on the appropriate approach for management of these cases. Thyroid ultrasound, scintigraphy and fine-needle aspiration biopsy (FNAB) are suggested to exclude malignant thyroid lesions. Our aim is to determine the importance of increased F-18 FDG uptake in TG on PET/CT in patients who are being screened for various NTC and to recommend a diagnostic strategy to identify patients with high risk of thyroid malignancy. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We evaluated 1086 cases undergoing whole-body PET/CT scan between April 2011 and April 2012. Images with incidental focal FDG uptake in TG were identified. Data of the age, sex, type of primary cancer, maximum standard uptake value (SUVmax), size of thyroid nodules and cervical lymph nodes (CLN) on F-18 FDG-PET/CT images, and if avalaible, FNAB results were evaluated. RESULT(S): 28 of 1086 patients (2.5%) showed a focal increased F-18 FDG uptake of lesions in TG (14 men, 14 women, mean age+/-SD, 60.29+/-13 years) and the SUVmax value ranged from 1.50 to 18.00 (average SUVmax: 4.19+/-3.41). Thyroid lesions ranged in diameter from 7.0 to 55.0 milimeter (mean+/-SD:16.47+/-11.80mm). The CLN were detected in 11/28 patients (39%). The average SUVmax in CLN was 4.04+/-1.80, the mean CLN diameter was 10.13+/-2.95mm. Twelve of 28 patients (43%) were done FNAB, and the final histopathological diagnosis was malign thyroid nodules in five patient (avarage SUVmax 6.84+/-6.37 and nodule diameter 31.26+/-22.11mm), benign thyroid disease in five patient (avarage SUVmax 3.95+/-1.48 and nodule diameter 9.60+/-2.30mm) and limited and unsufficient materials in two patients. Sixteen patients did not undergo any diagnostic test. CONCLUSION(S): Focal increased FDG uptake in TG incidentally identified on FDG-PET/CT occurred at a frequency of 2.5% and this finding may be associated with an increased risk of malignancy, but the clinical significance is unclear. More data are needed to elucidate the role of SUV in the differentiation of benign and malign thyroid lesions. Clinicians should take into consideration incidentally detected PET/CT findings. Thyroid scintigraphy and, if cold nodule is present, FNAB should be suggested to clinicians for definitive diagnosis.",Excluded
2442,"Myeloablative unrelated cord blood transplantation for acute leukemia patients between 50 and 55 years of age: Single institutional retrospective comparison with patients younger than 50 years of age Increasing recipient age is a well-known risk factor for graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) and treatment-related mortality (TRM) and has a negative impact on allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. Since the incidence of severe GVHD after cord blood transplantation (CBT) is lower than that after transplants using bone marrow or mobilized peripheral blood grafts from adult cells, we should expect better outcomes from CBT in older patients. To evaluate the feasibility and efficacy of myeloablative unrelated CBT in patients aged between 50 and 55 years, we performed a retrospective comparison of 100 patients with acute leukemia who received cord blood grafts at our institution. Nineteen older patients (median age, 52; range, 50-55) and 81 younger patients (median, 36; range, 16-49) received a myeloablative conditioning regimen including 12 Gy of total body irradiation and chemotherapy. GVHD prophylaxis included cyclosporine with (n = 96) or without (n = 4) methotrexate. There were no significant differences in the incidences of grades II to IV acute GVHD, extensive-type chronic GVHD, TRM, and the probability of overall and disease-free survival between these groups. These results suggest that, in patients with acute leukemia, myeloablative CBT might be as safe and effective in patients aged between 50 and 55 years as in younger patients. © Springer-Verlag 2008.",Excluded
999,"Oblique corpectomy for treatment of cervical spine epidural abscesses: Report on four cases Background Spinal epidural abscesses (SEAs) in cervical locations are particularly life-threatening. Currently, SEAs are widely treated with bony decompression, followed by internal stabilization in purulent osteomyelitis. However, recently, a growing number of studies have reported minimally invasive approaches without internal fixation. Purpose We describe four patients with cervical SEAs that were evacuated by oblique corpectomy (OC) without fusion. Methods This study included two women and two men (aged 44-90) that received operations for removing ventral cervical SEAs. All patients presented with progressively increasing myelopathy, and 3 had severe comorbid conditions. In all cases, a multilevel OC without fusion was performed. The amount of bone resection was tailored to fit the needs of granulation removal, with an effort to retain as much of the vertebral bodies as possible. Then, pus was evacuated and debridement of granulation was performed, followed by rinsing and drainage. Results The neurological status of 3 patients improved significantly after surgery. At the last follow-up examination, one showed full recovery, and in two a minor residual deficit persisted. During mean follow-up of 5.5 years, no internal stabilization was necessary. The oldest patient was tetraplegic, and had several concomitant diseases. That patient died from sudden cardiac arrest on the third postoperative day. Oblique corpectomy did not affect the anterior or posterior column. Additionally, it provided a broad view of the ventral aspect of the spinal canal. Conclusions Oblique corpectomy allows appropriate spinal cord decompression and granulation removal in the case of cervical spine epidural abscess, without sacrificing spinal stability.Copyright © 2016",Excluded
2763,"Fat depot specific differences in mRNA expression of novel loci associated with waist-hip ratio Background and aims: Body fat distribution is one of the main predictors of obesity-associated complications. It might be hypothesised that changes in the gene expression or in gene function caused by genetic variants may result in metabolic alterations related to obesity. We therefore investigated the adipose tissue expression profiles of 6 loci (TBX15, WARS, PIGC, STAB1, GRB14, ZNRF3), identified in a recent genome-wide association study (GWAS) for WHR, as their exact role in fat distribution remains largely unknown. Effects of genetic variants within these loci (rs984222 TBX15/WARS; rs6784615 STAB1; rs1011731 PIGC; rs4823006 ZNFR3; rs10195252 GRB14) on gene expression, WHR, and obesity related traits were examined. Material(s) and Method(s): Paired samples of visceral (vis) and subcutaneous (sc) adipose tissue were obtained from 297 Caucasian men and women who underwent open abdominal surgery. Abdominal vis and sc fat area was calculated using CT scans and percentage body fat was measured by dualenergy X-ray absorptiometry. Gene expression was measured by quantitative real-time PCR by using TaqMan methodology. SNP genotyping was done using the TaqMan SNP Genotyping assay. Differences in mRNA expression between vis and sc adipose tissue were assessed using the paired t-test. Correlation analyses were carried out and multivariate linear relationships were assessed by generalized linear regression models. Two-sided P-values <0.05 were considered to provide nominal evidence for association (adj. age, gender). Result(s): Differential expression between vis and sc adipose tissue could be observed for all tested genes. Except for STAB1 with higher mRNA expression in sc adipose tissue of males vs. females, there were no gender differences in gene expression in either tissue. Surprisingly, no correlation between WHR and fat mRNA expression of any of the genes was observed except for WARS whose expression in vis fat correlated positively with WHR in men. However, mRNA expression of several genes (e.g. WARS, PIGC, STAB1) correlated with BMI. Further, STAB1 expression in sc adipose tissue correlated with fat mass, and ZNRF3 expression in sc tissue correlated negatively with vis fat area. In addition, vis as well as sc expression of WARS and PIGC correlated negatively with both vis and sc fat area. Nominal associations were detected for rs984222 and TBX15 mRNA expression, rs4823006 and ZNFR3 mRNA expression, and rs10195252 and GRB14 mRNA expression, whereat rs984222 was also associated with BMI, sc and vis fat area as well as the GRB14 SNP with waist and waist-hip ratio in men (adj. age, BMI). Conclusion(s): Besides rather moderate correlations of the expression levels with BMI or WHR, the most striking feature of expression of the 6 examined genes is the inter-depot variability as well as correlations with the vis and sc fat area. Our data further support the role of genes from recent GWAS in the regulation of fat distribution.",Excluded
2916,Postoperative X-ray chest after supracostal puncture: Mandatory after every case of percutaneous nephrolithotomy? Introduction and Objective: It is a routine practice to get postoperative X-ray done after supracostal access in PCNL. Although the incidence of hydro-pneumothorax is very less and routine X-ray chest unnecessarily increase the radiation exposure to patients. The aim of our study was to assess the role of postoperative X-ray chest after supra costal puncture in PCNL for the detection and management of pneumothorax and/or hydrothorax. Material(s) and Method(s): We retrospectively reviewed 347 patients who underwent PCNL at our institute between Jan. 2007 and February 2011. 66.6% were male and 33.4% were female. Out of 347 PCNL supracostal upper calyceal puncture was done in 102 patients: 54 on right side and 48 on left side. In 23 patients three punctures were made and 31 patients required two tracts for complete stone clearance. Result(s): All punctures were done between 11-12th intercostal space and all patients underwent a post operative X-ray chest. In 1 patient hydro pneumothorax was detected which improved after intercostal chest tube drainage. One patient had mild pleural effusion which was managed conservatively. Both these patients had complaint of respiratory difficulty in postoperative period. In rest of the patients chest X-rays were normal and had no respiratory discomfort in post operative period. Conclusion(s): Routine post operative X-ray chest is not mandatory after every PCNL with supracostal access. When intra-operative pneumothorax is suspected or patient complain of respiratory difficulty in postoperative period then X-ray chest should be done.,Excluded
828,"Gamma-H2AX-based dose estimation for whole and partial body radiation exposure Most human exposures to ionising radiation are partial body exposures. However, to date only limited tools are available for rapid and accurate estimation of the dose distribution and the extent of the body spared from the exposure. These parameters are of great importance for emergency triage and clinical management of exposed individuals. Here, measurements of gamma-H2AX immunofluorescence by microscopy and flow cytometry were compared as rapid biodosimetric tools for whole and partial body exposures. Ex vivo uniformly X-irradiated blood lymphocytes from one donor were used to generate a universal biexponential calibration function for gamma-H2AX foci/intensity yields per unit dose for time points up to 96 hours post exposure. Foci--but not intensity--levels remained significantly above background for 96 hours for doses of 0.5 Gy or more. Foci-based dose estimates for ex vivo X-irradiated blood samples from 13 volunteers were in excellent agreement with the actual dose delivered to the targeted samples. Flow cytometric dose estimates for X-irradiated blood samples from 8 volunteers were in excellent agreement with the actual dose delivered at 1 hour post exposure but less so at 24 hours post exposure. In partial body exposures, simulated by mixing ex vivo irradiated and unirradiated lymphocytes, foci/intensity distributions were significantly over-dispersed compared to uniformly irradiated lymphocytes. For both methods and in all cases the estimated fraction of irradiated lymphocytes and dose to that fraction, calculated using the zero contaminated Poisson test and gamma-H2AX calibration function, were in good agreement with the actual mixing ratios and doses delivered to the samples. In conclusion, gamma-H2AX analysis of irradiated lymphocytes enables rapid and accurate assessment of whole body doses while dispersion analysis of foci or intensity distributions helps determine partial body doses and the irradiated fraction size in cases of partial body exposures.",Excluded
483,"Occupational risk factors and reproductive health of women BACKGROUND: This in-depth review summarizes and interprets the available recent epidemiologic evidence on the relationship between occupational exposures and negative reproductive outcome among women workers. METHODS: The studies examined by the review include those published in the international scientific literature since 1990, and were identified through the search of relevant data banks using selected keywords. RESULTS: From the examination of studies dealing with exposures of women to chemical agents, pesticides, physical agents, ergonomic factors and stress, it appears that at present the evidence is sufficient to warrant the maximum protection of pregnant women to several well-documented occupational risk factors. These include exposures to anaesthetic gases, antineoplastic drugs, heavy metals, solvents, heavy physical work and irregular work schedules. For other work risks, such as exposure to non-ionizing radiation and psychosocial work stress, the evidence is often suggestive but not conclusive. CONCLUSIONS: Policy makers and health professionals should advise women and employers to avoid exposure to the well-known occupational risk factors, while epidemiologic research should pursue methodological improvements and provide more insight into the magnitude of exposures responsible for detrimental effects.

We compared the PET findings with computed tomography (CT), which was available in 21 (55%) patients, and tabulated the changes in the diagnostic evaluation and therapeutic management that were prompted by PET during a follow-up period of 10 to 36 months., RESULTS: Compared with PET, the extent of disease was underestimated by CT in 5 (13%) patients. Planned surgical resection of metastases was canceled in two of these patients. In another patient, surveillance PET detected an unsuspected hypermetabolic abdominal mass that was noted on a subsequent CT to arise from the small bowel. The mass was found to be jejunal metastatic melanoma at the time of resection. Overall, PET influenced surgical management in 3 (8%) patients, but it did not affect the wait-and-watch strategy or decision to initiate immunotherapy in the others., CONCLUSIONS: FDG PET contributes important information not provided by CT and has a substantial effect on the clinical management of patients with malignant melanoma.",Excluded
615,"MRI can play a decisive role in establishing acute and chronic muscle infarction as the primary and often unsuspected cause of sickle cell crisis: A 20-year follow-up of prior and current cases Objective: To demonstrate that MRI rather than radionuclide, CT, ultrasound or PET scans is most efficient and specific in establishing muscle infarction as the primary cause of sickle cell crisis. MRI can therefore serve as a basis for initiating prompt treatment in the emergency department or nontreatment in the setting of suspected addiction. Longstanding chronic changes are also important to recognize. Material(s) and Method(s): Thirty patients with sickle cell disease included 17 patients followed for 20 years (6 male, 11 female; age range, 17-55 years, 15 with sickle cell anemia and 2 sickle beta thalassemia) with MRI-documented muscle infarcts initially imaged within 24-72 hours of limb pain utilizing Phillips 0.5-T superconductive magnets with interim and more recent studies using superconductive 1.5- and 3-T magnets (Sigma, GE Healthcare), dedicated extremity coils, and T1-weighted, fast spin-echo, fat-saturated, and fluid-sensitive sequences. Result(s): All studies showed acute and chronic abnormal MRI soft-tissue patterns. One third of lower limbs (20 of 60 prior patients) had focally increased signal loci compatible with acute or subacute inflammation, edema, or both associated with hemorrhage or ischemia. In cases without SI alteration in bone or soft tissue, sickle cell crisis could not be substantiated. In the 20 limbs with increased SI loci followed for 20 years, changes ranged from diminishing signal alterations to complete, often bilaterally symmetric curvilinear or rectangular signal voids attributed to infarcts or fibrosis. Recent radiographs when interpreted without adequate history or referral to prior MR studies showed large focal ossifications at one of multiple sites in upper and lower limbs compatible with myositis ossificans without known conventional trauma. Conclusion(s): MR imaging can function as an effective problem solver in patients with sickle cell disease with extremity pain without definitive evidence on multiple other imaging modalities in instances of suspected sickle cell crisis. Chronic or long delayed soft-tissue changes of sickle cell crisis are important to recognize along with muscle involvement in an acute crisis. The latter leads to prompt treatment in the emergency department or no treatment in instances of suspected addiction. Chronic soft-tissue changes are also important since they may be mistaken for nonspecific entities, e.g., myositis ossificans in all stages of repair and resolution on the commonly used imaging modalities in modern practice. Routine radiographs most specifically document mature ossifications.",Excluded

In the current study, the authors reappraised, using a competing risk analysis, the efficacy and safety of 3-st-GK-Tx by comparing their experience with that of the C-series. METHODS This was a retrospective cohort study. Among 1767 patients undergoing GK radiosurgery for brain metastases at Mito Gamma House during the 2005-2015 period, 78 (34 female, 44 male; mean age 65 years, range 35-86 years) whose largest tumor was > 10 cm3, treated with 3-st-GK-Tx, were studied (referred to in this study as the M-series). The target volumes were covered with a 50% isodose gradient and irradiated with a peripheral dose of 10 Gy at each procedure. The interval between procedures was 2 weeks. Because competing risk analysis had not been employed in the published C-series, the authors reanalyzed the previously published data using this method. RESULTS The overall median survival time after 3-st-GK-Tx was 8.3 months (95% CI 5.6-12.0 months) in the M-series and 8.6 months (95% CI 5.5-10.6 months) in the C-series (p = 0.41). Actuarial survival rates at the 6th and 12th post-3-st-GK-Tx months were, respectively, 55.1% and 35.2% in the M-series and 62.5% and 26.4% in the C-series (HR 1.175, 95% CI 0.790-1.728, p = 0.42). Cumulative incidences at the 12th post-3-st-GK-Tx, determined by competing risk analyses, of neurological deterioration (14.2% in C-series vs 12.8% in M-series), neurological death (7.2% vs 7.7%), local recurrence (4.8% vs 6.2%), repeat SRS (25.9% vs 18.0%), and SRS-related complications (2.3% vs 5.1%) did not differ significantly between the 2 series. CONCLUSIONS There were no significant differences in post-3-st-GK-Tx results between the 2 series in terms of overall survival times, neurological death, maintained neurological status, local control, repeat SRS, and SRS-related complications. The previously published results (C-series) are considered to be validated by the M-series results.Copyright ©AANS 2018.",Excluded
1224,"Ultrasmall WS2 Quantum Dots with Visible Fluorescence for Protection of Cells and Animal Models from Radiation-Induced Damages Two-dimensional WS2 materials have attracted wide attention in condensed physics and materials science due to its unique geometric and electronic structures. Particularly, WS2 shows extraordinary catalytic activities when its size decreases to ultrasmall, which provides potential opportunities for medical applications. In this work, WS2 quantum dots with strong catalytic properties were used for in vitro and in vivo protection from ionizing radiation induced cell damages. WS2 quantum dots possess unique optical properties of blue photoluminescence emission and excitation-wavelength dependent emission profiles. In vitro studies showed that cell viability can be considerably improved and cellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) can be removed by WS2 quantum dots. In vivo studies showed WS2 quantum dots can effectively protect the hematopoietic system and DNA from damages caused by high-energy radiation through removing whole-body excessive ROS. Furthermore, WS2 quantum dots showed nearly 80% renal clearance within 24 h post injection and did not cause any obvious toxicities in up to 30 days after treatment.Copyright © 2017 American Chemical Society.",Excluded
1503,"The value of enhanced magnetic resonance imaging in the evaluation of endocochlear disease BACKGROUND: Gadolinium-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (GdMRI) is routinely used in the evaluation and management of suspected retrocochlear pathology such as vestibular schwannoma. However, its value in the evaluation and diagnosis of cochlear pathology associated with sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL) has been less clear., STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective review of case histories and imaging studies of patients with SNHL and cochlear enhancement on GdMRI diagnosed between 1998 and 2000., RESULTS: Five patients with SNHL who required gadolinium administration to establish the diagnosis of endocochlear disease were identified. Diagnosed lesions included an intralabyrinthine schwannoma, intracochlear hemorrhage, radiation-induced ischemic change, autoimmune labyrinthitis, and meningogenic labyrinthitis. In these illustrative cases, the GdMRI demonstrated intrinsic high signal or contrast enhancement within the cochlea and labyrinth in the absence of a retrocochlear mass. In one patient with meningogenic labyrinthitis, cochlear enhancement on MRI led to prompt cochlear implantation before the potential development of cochlear ossification., CONCLUSION: Our experience suggests that GdMRI plays a crucial role in the diagnosis of cochlear pathology associated with sensorineural hearing loss and may directly impact patient management.",Excluded
2889,"Radiation and host factors in human thyroid tumors following thymus irradiation In this paper thyroid tumor data from the 1971 survey of the Rochester, New York thymus irradiated population are further analyzed to study radiobiological and host factors. The analyses were based on the approximately 2650 irradiated subjects and 4800 sibling controls who had 5 or more years of follow-up. Twenty-four thyroid cancers and 52 thyroid adenomas were found in the irradiated group, and 0 thyroid cancers and 6 adenomas among the controls. The overall risk estimates were 3.8 thyroid cancers/106 PY-rad and 4.5 thyroid adenomas/106 PY-rad. The dose-response data (thyroid dose range of 5 to > 1000 rad) for thyroid cancer indicate both a linear and a dose-squared component, but no dose-squared component is evident for thyroid adenomas. At lower total doses (< 400 rad) there was a suggestion that dose fractionation diminished the thyroid cancer response, but a similar fractionation effect was not found for thyroid adenomas. The temporal pattern of tumors suggested an extended plateau of excess tumor production, rather than a 'wavelike' temporal pattern. There was no evidence for an inverse relationship between thyroid radiation dose and thyroid cancer latency. Female and Jewish subjects had a higher risk of radiation-induced thyroid cancer than did their respective counterparts. The additive and multiplicative models of radiation effects were compared with respect to sex differences; neither model provided a superior fit to the data. The tentative nature of the conclusion is stressed because of the relatively small number of thyroid cancers.",Included
1146,"Occupational Health Risks in Cardiac Catheterization Laboratory Workers BACKGROUND: Orthopedic strain and radiation exposure are recognized risk factors in personnel staff performing fluoroscopically guided cardiovascular procedures. However, the potential occupational health effects are still unclear. The purpose of this study was to examine the prevalence of health problems among personnel staff working in interventional cardiology/cardiac electrophysiology and correlate them with the length of occupational radiation exposure., METHODS AND RESULTS: We used a self-administered questionnaire to collect demographic information, work-related information, lifestyle-confounding factors, all current medications, and health status. A total number of 746 questionnaires were properly filled comprising 466 exposed staff (281 males; 44+/-9 years) and 280 unexposed subjects (179 males; 43+/-7years). Exposed personnel included 218 interventional cardiologists and electrophysiologists (168 males; 46+/-9 years); 191 nurses (76 males; 42+/-7 years), and 57 technicians (37 males; 40+/-12 years) working for a median of 10 years (quartiles: 5-24 years). Skin lesions (P=0.002), orthopedic illness (P<0.001), cataract (P=0.003), hypertension (P=0.02), and hypercholesterolemia (P<0.001) were all significantly higher in exposed versus nonexposed group, with a clear gradient unfavorable for physicians over technicians and nurses and for longer history of work (>16 years). In highly exposed physicians, adjusted odds ratio ranged from 1.7 for hypertension (95% confidence interval: 1-3; P=0.05), 2.9 for hypercholesterolemia (95% confidence interval: 1-5; P=0.004), 4.5 for cancer (95% confidence interval: 0.9-25; P=0.06), to 9 for cataract (95% confidence interval: 2-41; P=0.004)., CONCLUSIONS: Health problems are more frequently observed in workers performing fluoroscopically guided cardiovascular procedures than in unexposed controls, raising the need to spread the culture of safety in the cath laboratory.

3303,"Benefits of an intraoral stent in decreasing the irradiation dose to oral healthy tissue: dosimetric and clinical features OBJECTIVE: To determine whether an intraoral stent may decrease radiation dose to health tissues during intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) and to evaluate the effect on mucositis., STUDY DESIGN: A total of 33 patients with tongue or floor of the mouth cancer were retrospectively evaluated and divided into 2 groups: group 1 (with stent, n = 19) and group 2 (without stent, n = 14). Data were collected on dosimetric and mucositis outcomes., RESULTS: The mean dose to the maxilla was significantly lower in group 1 (20.9 Gy) than in group 2 (35.8 Gy) (P = .05). The mean dose to the ipsilateral parotid was 35.0 Gy in group 1 vs 41.8 Gy in group 2 (P = .05). No difference was seen in the severity of mucositis between groups (P = .82). However, grade III mucositis was present in group 1 at 4 weeks after IMRT, 1 week after its occurrence in group 2., CONCLUSIONS: A stent was effective in decreasing doses to healthy structures and delaying the emergence of mucositis.Copyright © 2014 Elsevier Inc.

1419,"The effect of irradiation on the biodistribution of radiolabeled pegylated liposomes PURPOSE: The effect of total-body irradiation (TBI) on the biodistribution and pharmacokinetics of (111)In-DTPA-labeled pegylated liposomes (IDLPL) was evaluated in tumor-bearing nude mice as part of an ongoing effort to develop liposome-targeted radiosensitizers., METHODS AND MATERIALS: Mice received TBI (2 Gy or 5 Gy) according to two protocols: (1) to test the effect of radiation delivered 30 min before liposome injection on the time course of IDLPL biodistribution to tumor and normal tissues over 96 h; (2) to test the effect of radiation at times ranging from 72 h to 1 h before liposome injection on tumor and normal tissue uptake of IDLPL at 24 h. Tumor and tissue/organ levels of liposome uptake were measured by dissection and quantitation in a gamma counter., RESULTS: For most tissues (tumor, liver, kidney, lung, skin, heart, and central nervous system), irradiation did not alter IDLPL biodistribution. Splenic uptake appeared to be increased by TBI, but further analysis revealed that this effect was due to reduced splenic weight in irradiated mice. IDLPL uptake was increased in the small intestine, stomach, musculoskeletal system, female reproductive tract, and adrenal glands in irradiated mice., CONCLUSION: These findings suggest that concomitant administration of liposomal radiosensitizers during radical radiotherapy is likely to be safe. However, caution should be exercised in situations in which significant volumes of small intestine or hemopoietic tissue will be irradiated.",Excluded
2436,"Willingness to pay for sustainable aviation depends on ticket price, greenhouse gas reductions and gender Background: There has been a plethora of research into sustainable transportation, with quite a few research studies coming out in the past few years examining sustainable aviation. Much of this research focuses on developing new types of green products, including biofuels, eco-friendly airports, recycled building materials, water reuse projects, and other sustainable practices. Fewer studies have focused on consumer willingness to pay for new sustainable aviation projects. No study that we know of has examined how much extra consumers would be willing to pay as a function of the sustainability benefit. Methods: Across two studies, 1192 participants were presented with a hypothetical scenario about flying in a commercial airplane that was designed to provide a 1050% reduction (in 10% increments) in greenhouse gases. Participants were then asked about their willingness to pay an additional 5%, 10% or 15% increase in ticket price for each of the reduction increments. Results: In general, more reductions in greenhouse gases increased willingness to pay the additional ticket price; however, this was limited in the 15% ticket price condition, particularly for long-haul flights. In addition, women were generally more willing to pay the additional ticket price compared to men; however, this was more pronounced for shorter domestic flights compared to long-haul flights. Conclusions: Airlines can expect consumers to accept a small increase in ticket prices if they are convinced that the airplane flight emits fewer greenhouse gases. We discuss the implications of these findings. 2019 Elsevier Ltd",Excluded
2760,"Is computerised 3D templating more accurate than 2D templating to predict size of components in primary total hip arthroplasty? Introduction: The aim of this study was to compare the accuracy of preoperative templating in total hip arthroplasty (THA) using conventional 2-dimensional (2D) and computed tomography (CT)-based 3-dimensional (3D) measures. Method(s): One hundred and sixteen consecutive primary THAs were analysed. The preoperative diagnosis was primary osteoarthritis in all cases. The 2D templating and the 3D templating were performed by two different residents. All templating results were available for the orthopaedic surgeon performing the procedure. Accuracies with regard to the predicted and actual implant sizes were determined for each procedure. Implantation of the size as planned was defined as ""exact"", whereas the use of components within one size larger or smaller (+/-1) as planned were defined as ""accurate."" Results: The 3D templating was significantly more accurate in predicting implant sizing compared to 2D templating for primary total hip arthroplasty (THA). The difference was statistically significant for the cup templating (''exact'' p = 0.02; ''accurate'' p = 0.01) and for the stem templating (''exact'' p = 0.04; ''accurate'' p = 0.01). Conclusion(s): Our results support the superiority of 3D templating over 2D templating in predicting implant size.Copyright © The Author(s) 2018.",Excluded
69,"Changes in boundary extension effect during spatial confinement Changes in perception during space missions are usually attributed to microgravity. However, additional factors, such as spatial confinement, may contribute to changes in perception. We tested changes in scene perception using a boundary extension (BE) paradigm during a 105-day Earth-based space-simulation study. In addition to the close-up/wide-angle views used in BE, we presented two types of scenes based on the distance from the observer (proximal/distant scenes). In crew members (n = 6), we found that BE partly increased over time, but the size of BE error did not change in the control group (n = 22). We propose that this effect is caused by an increasing BE effect in stimuli that depict distant scenes and is related to spatial confinement. The results might be important for other situations of spatial confinement with restricted visual depth (e.g., submarine crew, patients confined to a bed). Generally, we found a larger BE effect in proximal scenes compared with the distant scenes. We also demonstrated that with no feedback, subjects preserve the level of the BE effect during repeated measurements. © 2014 © 2014 Taylor & Francis.",Excluded
3063,"Impact of shoulder deformation on volumetric modulated arc therapy doses for head and neck cancer PURPOSE: When using volumetric modulated arc therapy (VMAT) for head and neck cancer, setup errors regarding the shoulders can create loss of target coverage or increased organ-at-risk doses. This study created variations of realistic shoulder deformations to understand the associated VMAT dosimetric effects and investigated water-equivalent thickness (WET) differences using in-house software., METHODS: Ten patients with head and neck cancer with lower neck involvement were retrospectively and randomly enrolled. Their retrospective analysis comprised treatment planning using RayStation 5.0 (RaySearch Laboratories, Stockholm, Sweden), shoulder deformation of 5-15mm in three-dimensional axes using the ImSimQA package (Oncology Systems Limited, Shrewsbury, Shropshire, UK), and evaluation of the clinical impact of the dose distribution after recalculating the dose distribution using computed tomography images of deformed shoulders and deforming the dose distribution. Additionally, our in-house software program was used to measure WET differences for shoulder deformation., RESULTS: WET differences were greater in the superoinferior (SI) direction than in the other directions (the WET difference was >20mm for 15-mm SI deformation). D99%, D98%, and D95% for all clinical target volumes were within 3%. Local dose differences of more than +/-10% were found for normal tissues at the level of the shoulder for 15-mm movement in the SI direction., CONCLUSIONS: Shoulder deformation of >6mm could cause large dose variations delivered to the targeted tissue at the level of the shoulder. Thus, to ensure delivery of appropriate treatment coverage to the targeted tissue, shoulder deformation should be taken into consideration during the planning stage.

668,"Stage I-II non-small-cell lung cancer treated using either stereotactic ablative radiotherapy (SABR) or lobectomy by video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS): outcomes of a propensity score-matched analysis BACKGROUND: Video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) lobectomy and stereotactic ablative radiotherapy (SABR) are both used for early-stage non-small-cell lung cancer. We carried out a propensity score-matched analysis to compare locoregional control (LRC).
PATIENTS AND METHODS: VATS lobectomy data from six hospitals were retrospectively accessed; SABR data were obtained from a single institution database. Patients were matched using propensity scores based on cTNM stage, age, gender, Charlson comorbidity score, lung function and performance score. Eighty-six VATS and 527 SABR patients were matched blinded to outcome (1:1 ratio, caliper distance 0.025). Locoregional failure was defined as recurrence in/adjacent to the planning target volume/surgical margins, ipsilateral hilum or mediastinum. Recurrences were either biopsy-confirmed or had to be PET-positive and reviewed by a tumor board.
RESULTS: The matched cohort consisted of 64 SABR and 64 VATS patients with the median follow-up of 30 and 16 months, respectively. Post-SABR LRC rates were superior at 1 and 3 years (96.8% and 93.3% versus 86.9% and 82.6%, respectively, P = 0.04). Distant recurrences and overall survival (OS) were not significantly different.
CONCLUSION: This retrospective analysis found a superior LRC after SABR compared with VATS lobectomy, but OS did not differ. Our findings support the need to compare both treatments in a randomized, controlled trial.",Included
1347,"Solid cancer mortality associated with chronic external radiation exposure at the french atomic energy commission and nuclear fuel company Studies of nuclear workers make it possible to directly quantify the risks associated with ionizing radiation exposure at low doses and low dose rates. Studies of the CEA (Commissariat l'Energie Atomique) and AREVA Nuclear Cycle (AREVA NC) cohort, currently the most informative such group in France, describe the long-term risk to nuclear workers associated with external exposure. Our aim is to assess the risk of mortality from solid cancers among CEA and AREVA NC nuclear workers and its association with external radiation exposure. Standardized mortality ratios (SMRs) were calculated and internal Poisson regressions were conducted, controlling for the main confounding factors sex, attained age, calendar period, company and socioeconomic status (SES). During the period 19682004, there were 2,035 solid cancers among the 36,769 CEA-AREVA NC workers. Cumulative external radiation exposure was assessed for the period 19502004, and the mean cumulative dose was 12.1 mSv. Mortality rates for all causes and all solid cancers were both significantly lower in this cohort than in the general population. A significant excess of deaths from pleural cancer, not associated with cumulative external dose, was observed, probably due to past asbestos exposure. We observed a significant excess of melanoma, also unassociated with dose. Although cumulative external dose was not associated with mortality from all solid cancers, the central estimated excess relative risk (ERR) per Sv of 0.46 for solid cancer mortality was higher than the 0.26 calculated for male Hiroshima and Nagasaki A-bomb survivors 50 years or older and exposed at the age of 30 years or older. The modification of our results after stratification for SES demonstrates the importance of this characteristic in occupational studies, because it makes it possible to take class-based lifestyle differences into account, at least partly. These results show the great potential of a further joint international study of nuclear workers, which should improve knowledge about the risks associated with chronic low doses and provide useful risk estimates for radiation protection. © 2011 by Radiation Research Society.",Included

We evaluated the impact of collimation to the 'minimal required field size' on clinically significant parameters of radiation exposure.Methods and resultsRadiation dose measured by dose area product (DAP) and radiation dose rate measured by DAP per minute of fluoroscopy were determined for all 571 electrophysiology procedures performed in a single electrophysiology laboratory from January 2010 to December 2010. Data from 205 procedures performed by one interventional electrophysiologist, who instituted a practice of routinely collimating to the minimum required visual fluoroscopy field on a case-by-case basis, were compared with data from 366 procedures performed by the three other experienced interventional electrophysiologists using the laboratory who continued their existing practice of ad hoc collimation. Significant reductions in radiation exposure were seen with the practice of routine maximal collimation. The largest reductions were seen during 'simple' ablation procedures.ConclusionA practice of routinely collimating to the minimum required visual fluoroscopy field results in significant reductions in radiation exposure when compared with a usual approach to collimation.

771,"Prospects of application of new photosensitizer Elophit"" in photodynamic therapy for treating some dermatologic diseases"" Purpose: Purpose of the present work was to study photosensitizer (PS) Elophit"" effectiveness for PDT sessions in some dermatologic diseases. Material(s) and Method(s): Gel ""Elophit"" is a complex substance containing chlorins E6 (0.5%), copper chlorophyllin (0.5%), hyaluronic acid (2%) (conformance certificate No. ROSS RU.IM; 25130 2322). Therapeutic effects are produced not only due to the chlorin E6 photodynamic (PDT) action but also due to the action of copper derivatives which have anti-inflammatory and immunomodulating effects. The preparation easily penetrates into the skin and accumulates in inflammatory foci. Gel ""Elophit"" was put on skin lesions 40 min before PDT session. Before the session preparation remnants were removed off the skin with a mild alcohol solution. PDT was performed in 12 patients with Acne vulgaris (papulla-pustular form) (4 males, 8 females), 8 patients with superficial forms of streptostaphylodermias (5 males, 3 females). Controls were 24 patients with Acne vulgaris (papulla-pustular form), 20 patients with streptostaphylodermias. Age - 17-58 years old, disease duration from 1 week to 6 years. Patients from the control group received traditional therapy without PDT component. Device ""Soljaris"" with incorporated diodes in the range 660 mum, irradiation power 400 mW was used as a light source. Irradiation was done in a scan manner (70-270 J/cm2). Sessions - twice a week. Research results were assessed by changes in the clinical picture using biophometry techniques with laser therapeutic apparatus ""Milta F-8-01"" having an in-built biophotometer. These changes are shown in photomaterials. FS accumulation degree in the skin was determined with spectrometry (apparatus ""LESA-01-BIOSPEC""). Result(s): A complete rash regression after 4-8 PDT sessions (in 2 weeks - 1 month) was seen in 8 (66.6%) patients with Acne vulgaris, in 5 (62.5%) patients with streptostaphylodermia; in the rest of patients a considerable clinical improvement was seen. No changes in clinical picture during PDT treatment was seen in 2 (16.6%) patients with Acne vulgaris and in 1 (12.5%) patients with streptostaphylodermia. In the controls one month later a clinical remission was seen in 10 (41.6%) patients with Acne vulgaris and in 11 (55%) patients with streptostaphylodermias, no changes - in 7 (29.1%) patients with Acne vulgaris and in 6 (30%) patients with streptostaphylodermias, in the rest of patients - a partial rash regression. A fluorescent examination has shown less FS fluorescence (by 60-75%) in the skin after irradiation what indicates a marked phodynamic effect with a considerable discharge of singlet oxygen. Clinical observations have been confirmed by the results of biophotometric examinations of skin lesions when one could see changes typical for decreased or resorpted inflammatory processes. Conclusion(s): Thus, as it has been shown by preliminary findings PDT with photosensitizer ""Elophit"" may be an effective technique for treating some dermatologic pathologies. Further researches are needed to study better effectiveness of PDT with gel ""Elophit"" application in dermatologic practice so as to determine indications and to develop optimal schemes for treatment.""",Excluded

Our research group has previously demonstrated that S100A4 is significantly elevated in peripheral blood, synovial fluid and synovial tissue of RA patients and that the levels of S100A4 correlate with disease activity. Objectives To evaluate the levels of S100A4 in serum of patients with recent-onset RA and to characterize the association of S100A4 with disease activity and response to treatment. Methods Serum levels of S100A4 protein were measured by ELISA in 59 patients with recent-onset RA (symptom duration <6 months) before and 3 months after initiation of treatment with disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs, and cross-sectionally in 42 healthy controls. IgM rheumatoid factor (IgM-RF), anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide antibodies (ACPA) and C-reactive protein (CRP) were analysed at baseline. Clinical disease activity (DAS28) was assessed at baseline and at 3, 6 and 12 months after initiation of treatment. The degree of radiographic joint damage was calculated from x-rays using the Sharp-van der Heijde Score (SHS) at baseline and at month 12. Results Mean DAS28 (SD) significantly decreased from 5.36 (1.42) at baseline to 3.09 (1.52) at month 3 (n=59) and to 2.69 (1.19) at month 12 (n=40), respectively (p<0.0001). Of the 40 patients with available radiographs, 9 (23%) showed an increase in SHS (SHS >0) after 12 months. The levels of serum S100A4 protein were significantly higher in patients with recent-onset RA compared to healthy controls (646.60+/-602.60 vs. 46.97+/-30.12 ng/ml; p<0.001) and significantly decreased after 3 months of treatment (to 388.10+/-521.00; p<0.001). There was positive correlation of baseline levels of S100A4 with IgM-RF (r=0.611; p<0.0001) and ACPA levels (r=0.471; p<0.001). After adjustment for IgM-RF, the levels of S100A4 at baseline (r=0.403; p<0.05) as well as at month 3 (r=0.548; p<0.01) were positively correlated with DAS28 after 12 months of treatment in female patients (n=28). There was no correlation in male patients. The levels of S100A4 did not correlate with disease activity at baseline or with the change of disease activity over time. Furthermore, there was no association between baseline levels or changes of SA100A4 and achievement of DAS28 remission or radiographic progression. Conclusions Our results indicate that circulating S100A4 levels are significantly higher in patients with recent-onset RA compared to healthy individuals and that higher S100A4 levels at baseline or at month 3 might have predictive potential for worse treatment response at month 12, at least in female patients with recent-onset RA.",Excluded

2574,"Dose-response relationships for radium-induced bone sarcomas The incidence of bone sarcomas among 3055 female radium-dial workers who entered the dial industry before 1950 was used to determine dose-response relationships for the induction of bone sarcomas by radium. Two subpopulations were analyzed: all measured cases who survived at least 5 yr after the start of employment and all cases who survived at least 2 yr after first measurement. The first constituted a group based on year of entry; it contained 1468 women who experienced 42 bone sarcomas; the expected number was 0.4. The second comprised a group based on first measurement; it contained 1257 women who experienced 13 bone sarcomas; the expected number was 0.2. The dose-response function, I = (C + alpha D + beta D2)e-gammaD, and simplifications of this general form, were fit to each data set. Incidence (I) was in units of bone sarcomas per person-yr; (D) was the quantity (muCi) of radium that entered the blood. Two functions, I = (C + alpha D + beta D2)e-gammaD and I = (C + beta D2)e-gammaD, fit the data for year of entry (p greater than or equal to 0.05); both these functions and I = (C + alpha D) fit the data for first measurement. The function I = (C + beta D2)e-gammaD was used to predict the number of bone sarcomas in all other pre-1950 radium cases (medical, laboratory and other exposures); fewer were actually observed than the fit of this function to the female dial workers predicted.",Excluded
2634,"MR-Angiography in assessing the anatomy of the renal arteries before renal sympathetic denervation The paper presents comparative analysis of preoperation MR-angiography and X-ray angiography carried out before renal denervation of sympathetic plexus of renal arteries in patients with resistant arterial hypertension. Purpose. To compare the data of MRA and diagnostic X-ray angiography of the renal arteries to determine a method that allows you to plan in detail the renal denervation procedure. Materials and methods. 44 patients (16 men, 28 women; average age was 59.18 years) with a verified diagnosis: resistant hypertension, admitted to treatment (renal denervation). All patients underwent standard preoperative laboratory and instrumental diagnostics. Survey aortography with selective renal angiography and MR angiography were performed in all 44 (100%) patients. Results and conclusion. It has been shown that both methods are comparable in the detection of renal arteries stenosis, as well as in visualization of the main renal artery and of segment branches of arteries, and in measurement of their diameters. In most cases MR-angiography a little bit exaggerates the diameter of the artery for as low as 0.6-0.8 mm. Also MR-angiography do not deliver radiation exposure to a patient. Moreover, MRA provides the opportunity of sequential thin-slice imaging, and may separate branches of the renal arteries up to segment branches of 3-4 classes with high accuracy. In total, the MRA predicts the anatomic imaging with invasive catheter X-ray angiography and allows to plan it in details before renal sympathetic denervation.Copyright © 2019 Russian Electronic Journal of Radiology.

The mean age in the present study was 38.7 years (median 35.0 range 1-93) and included 265 females and 251 males. All patients were followed for 7 years from diagnosis. For UC, 32 patients (12.1%) had a colectomy during the 7 years follow-up. Incidence of colectomy at 5 years was 9.8% (26 patients) and 8.7% (23) at 2 years. Fifty-two CD patients (28%) had their first intestinal resection (excluding fistula- and/or abscess's surgery) within 7 years follow-up. Forty-five (24.2%) had a resection within 5 years and 35 (18.8%) within 2 years follow-up. At 7 years follow-up 28 (8.0%) UC patients and 49 (26.6%) CD patients had at some point had biological treatment. Conclusion(s): Twenty-eight percent CD patients and 12.1% UC patients had their first surgery within 7 years follow-up. The surgical rates for CD in the present study in ""the biological era"" are lower than a previous Danish inception cohort from 1962-87 with surgical rates of 63% during ten years. However, it seems comparable to the surgery rates referred by the IBSEN study group, who reported 5 year surgical rates of CD and UC to 28.0% and 7.5% respectively in the mid-nineties. Conclusion, according to our data, introduction of biologics have not reduced the need of surgery in IBD.",Excluded
2598,"The value of Coronary Artery computed Tomography as the first-line anatomical test for stable patients with indications for invasive angiography due to suspected Coronary Artery Disease: CAT-CAD randomized trial Background: The aim of this prospective, randomized trial was to evaluate whether the use of coronary computed tomography angiography (CCTA) as the first-line anatomical test in patients with suspected significant coronary artery disease (CAD) may reduce the number of coronary invasive angiographies (ICA), and expand the use of CCTA in patients currently diagnosed invasively. Method(s): 120 patients (age:60.6 +/- 7.9 years, 35% female) with indications to ICA were randomized 1:1 to undergo CCTA versus direct ICA. Outcomes were evaluated during the diagnostic and therapeutic periods. Result(s): The number of invasively examined patients was reduced by 64.4% in the CCTA group as compared to the direct ICA group (21vs59,p < 0.0001). The number of patients with ICAs not followed by coronary intervention was reduced by 88.1% with the CCTA strategy (5vs42,p < 0.0001). Over the diagnostic and therapeutic course there were no significant differences regarding the median volume of contrast (CCTA 80.3 ml[65.0-165.0] vs ICA 90.0 ml[55.0-100.0], p = 0.099), while a non-significant trend towards higher radiation dose in the CCTA group was observed (9.9 mSv[7.0-22.1] vs 9.4 mSv[5.2-14.0], p = 0.05). There were no acute cardiovascular events. Conclusion(s): CCTA may hypothetically act as an effective 'gatekeeper' to the catheterization laboratory in the diagnosis of stable patients with current indications for ICA. This strategy may result in non-invasive, outpatient-based triage of two thirds of individuals without actionable CAD, obviating unnecessary invasive examinations. However, the longer follow-up is indispensable. ClinicalTrials.gov number: NCT02591992 The aim of our trial was to evaluate the clinical value of coronary computed tomography angiography (CCTA) as the first-line anatomical test in the diagnosis of stable patients with indications for invasive coronary angiography (ICA) due to suspected significant coronary artery disease (CAD). This is the first study triaging this group of patients with CT and the results of this randomized trial are promising in terms of safety and efficacy.Copyright © 2018 Society of Cardiovascular Computed Tomography",Excluded
1470,"Elevated mortality among birds in Chernobyl as judged from skewed age and sex ratios BACKGROUND: Radiation has negative effects on survival of animals including humans, although the generality of this claim is poorly documented under low-dose field conditions. Because females may suffer disproportionately from the effects of radiation on survival due to differences in sex roles during reproduction, radiation-induced mortality may result in male-skewed adult sex ratios., METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDING: We estimated the effects of low-dose radiation on adult survival rates in birds by determining age ratios of adults captured in mist nets during the breeding season in relation to background radiation levels around Chernobyl and in nearby uncontaminated control areas. Age ratios were skewed towards yearlings, especially in the most contaminated areas, implying that adult survival rates were reduced in contaminated areas, and that populations in such areas could only be maintained through immigration from nearby uncontaminated areas. Differential mortality in females resulted in a strongly male-skewed sex ratio in the most contaminated areas. In addition, males sang disproportionately commonly in the most contaminated areas where the sex ratio was male skewed presumably because males had difficulty finding and acquiring mates when females were rare. The results were not caused by permanent emigration by females from the most contaminated areas because none of the recaptured birds had changed breeding site, and the proportion of individuals with morphological abnormalities did not differ significantly between the sexes for areas with normal and higher levels of contamination., CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: These findings are consistent with the hypothesis that the adult survival rate of female birds is particularly susceptible to the effects of low-dose radiation, resulting in male skewed sex ratios at high levels of radiation. Such skewed age ratios towards yearlings in contaminated areas are consistent with the hypothesis that an area exceeding 30,000 km(2) in Chernobyl's surroundings constitutes an ecological trap that causes dramatic excess mortality.",Included
2538,"Diagnostic accuracy of high-definition CT coronary angiography in high-risk patients Aim To assess the diagnostic accuracy of computed tomography coronary angiography (CTCA) using a combination of high-definition CT (HD-CTCA) and high level of reader experience, with invasive coronary angiography (ICA) as the reference standard, in high-risk patients for the investigation of coronary artery disease (CAD). Materials and methods Three hundred high-risk patients underwent HD-CTCA and ICA. Independent experts evaluated the images for the presence of significant CAD, defined primarily as the presence of moderate (>=50%) stenosis and secondarily as the presence of severe (>=70%) stenosis in at least one coronary segment, in a blinded fashion. HD-CTCA was compared to ICA as the reference standard. Results No patients were excluded. Two hundred and six patients (69%) had moderate and 178 (59%) had severe stenosis in at least one vessel at ICA. The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value were 97.1%, 97.9%, 99% and 93.9% for moderate stenosis, and 98.9%, 93.4%, 95.7% and 98.3%, for severe stenosis, on a per-patient basis. Conclusion The combination of HD-CTCA and experienced readers applied to a high-risk population, results in high diagnostic accuracy comparable to ICA. Modern generation CT systems in experienced hands might be considered for an expanded role.Copyright © 2015 The Royal College of Radiologists.",Excluded

Material(s) and Method(s): The term small round blue cell"" is frequently used only as a cursory radiologic-pathologic correlation of aggressive tumors throughout the body. We evaluate the imaging characteristics, patient demographics, and pathologic findings in 88 patients with biopsy-proven small round blue cell tumors in the thorax performed within the past 10 years at our institution. All cases included imaging studies of conventional radiography, CT, or PET. Result(s): Review of the pathology database for thoracic small round blue cell tumors examined at our institution in the past 10 years revealed 88 cases in 45 male patients and 43 female patients. There were 66 cases of small cell carcinoma, seven cases of diffuse large B cell lymphoma, five cases of Hodgkin lymphoma, three cases of Ewing sarcoma, three cases of extranodal marginal zone B cell lymphoma, and one case each of posttransplant lymphoproliferative disorder, embryonal rhabdomyosarcoma, desmoplastic small round cell tumor, and peripheral T cell lymphoma. Patients ranged from 10 to 90 years old with an average age of 55.8 years. The oldest average age of presentation was seen in the small cell carcinoma subset, with 68.7 years. Most patients presented with adenopathy or pulmonary nodules/masses. Small cell tumors presented most commonly as smoothly marginated, multilobulated lesions with an average size on presentation of 5.9 cm. For each tumor subtype, we present histologic sections stained with H and E showing large blue nuclei with scant cytoplasms and describe distinguishing immunohistochemical and molecular chromosomal markers.

513,"Options for the modified radiation weighting factor of neutrons The recent ICRP Report 92 has noted that the current radiation weighting factor, wR, depends on the energy of the incident neutrons in a manner that differs substantially from the dependence, which results from the current convention, QL. At all neutron energies, but most conspicuously below 1 MeV, the values of wR exceed those of the effective quality factor, qE. The discrepancy is largely due to the fact that--in the absence of computed values of the effective quality factor for neutrons--wR has been patterned after the values of the ambient quality factor, which accounts insufficiently for the low-linear energy transfer (LET) gamma ray component from neutron capture in the human body. There are different options to remove the discrepancy. Option 1 is to reduce wR substantially at all neutron energies to make it equal to qE for a standard condition, such as isotropic incidence of the neutrons. Since such a reduction may cause problems in those countries where the current wR values are already legally implemented, ICRP 92 has proposed what is here termed Option 2. It recommended to replace QL by the increased value 1.6 QL - 0.6 and, accordingly, to make the radiation weighting factor equal to 1.6 qE - 0.6. With Option 2 the radiation weighting factor needs to be decreased appreciably at low neutron energies, but for fission neutron spectra the overall changes are minor. To guide--regardless which option is chosen--the selection of the numerical values, the effective quality factor, qE, is computed here for different directional distributions of neutrons incident on the anthropomorphic phantoms ADAM and EVA. None of the sex averaged numerical values is found to deviate much from those for isotropic incidence. Isotropic incidence can, thus, be used as an adequate standard condition. A numerical approximation is proposed for the standard qE that is nearly equivalent to a formula invoked by ICRP 92, but is somewhat simpler and provides realistic values of qE even for the extremely high neutron energies in space. In line with ICRP 92, it is emphasised that wR needs to be seen as a derived quantity related to the LET-dependent weighting factor. Copyright 2004 Oxford University Press",Excluded

The number and locus of intestinal metaplasia in the gastric region induced by 2,000 rads of X-ray were greater in the male than in the female. Alkaline phosphatase activity appeared in the male only. The intestinal metaplasia induced by stomach antigen injection in the male persisted longer than in the female. Moreover, the incidence of intestinal metaplasia caused by whole body irradiation in ovariectomized rats was significantly higher than in the sham-ovariectomized ones. Therefore, it is likely that male sex hormones are promoting while female sex hormones are inhibiting the development of intestinal metaplasia.",Included

3228,"Intracranial Autograft Fat Placement to Separate the Optic Chiasm from Tumor to Improve Stereotactic Radiotherapy Dosimetry Background: Radiation therapy for intracranial lesions is constrained by dose to neurologic organs at risk. Case Description: We report 2 cases, a newly diagnosed chondrosarcoma and a previously irradiated meningioma, with tumors that abutted the optic chiasm following subtotal resection. Definitive radiotherapy would have required either undercoverage of the tumor or treatment of the chiasm with doses posing an unacceptable risk of blindness. Therefore, the patients underwent open surgery with placement of an abdominal fat autograft to provide space between the tumor and the optic structures at risk. Patients received definitive fractionated stereotactic radiotherapy. For each patient, we retrospectively compared the treated plan (with fat autograft) to a second plan generated using the pre-autograft imaging, maintaining similar tumor coverage. For the chondrosarcoma, the fat autograft reduced the optic chiasm maximum dose by 21% (70.4 Gy to 55.3 Gy). For the reirradiated peri-optic meningioma, the optic chiasm maximum dose was reduced by 10% (50.8 Gy to 45.9 Gy), the left optic nerve by 17% (48.9 Gy to 40.4 Gy), and the right optic nerve by 30% (32.3 Gy to 22.6 Gy). Conclusion(s): We demonstrate the utility of abdominal fat autograft placement to maximize coverage of tumor while minimizing dose to intracranial organs at risk.Copyright © 2020 Elsevier Inc.",Excluded
327,"Radiation risks to lymphoma patients undergoing 18F-FDG studies Background: To investigate radiation risks to patients undergoing 18F-FDG studies that take into account patient age, sex, and weight. Method(s): We obtained patient demographics and weights of 54 consecutive patients with lymphoma who each underwent a18F-FDG PET study. The administered activity was converted into an effective dose using the patient size dependent dosimetry data provided in ICRP Publication 80. Patient effective doses were converted into estimates of the lifetime attributable risk of cancer incidence and cancer mortality using age and sex dependent risk factors provided in BEIR VII. Result(s): The average patient age/weight in this study was 43 years/68 kg for males and 33 years/61 kg for females. Patient effective dose are proportional to patient weight(-0.784) (r2 >0.99). The average administered activity was 410 MBq, which resulted in an average effective dose of 8.5 mSv for males and 8.9 mSv for females. The average cancer incidence was 0.71/1,000 cases for males, and 1.27/1,000 cases for females, with cancer mortality being about half the incidence. Cancer rates for the youngest patients were an order of magnitude higher than those for the oldest patients. Conclusion(s): Average lifetime attributable cancer risks to lymphoma patients from a single FDG-PET study is approximately 1 per 1,000, but are strongly influenced by patient age, gender and weight.

The esophagectomy specimens were sampled at the resection margins, the edge of irradiated length, 1 cm from the proximal and distal edge of visible tumor, the center of the tumor, and the lymph nodes., RESULTS: Radiation change in the form of fibrosis was limited to the submucosa at the resection margins, the circular muscle layer at the edge of irradiated length, and full thickness at 1 cm from the edge of the visible tumor and the center of the tumor. Surface epithelium did not show any changes at the resection margins but did show basal cell hyperplasia at the edge of the irradiated length and ulceration at 1 cm from the edge of the visible tumor and the center of the tumor. Endarteritis obliterans was seen only 1 cm from the edge of the visible tumor and the center of the tumor. Necrosis, intense keratin formation, and giant cell reaction were observed at the center of the tumor. When compared with the preradiotherapy biopsies, the amount of keratin in the postradiotherapy specimens was extensive. HDRILBT may cause induction of the keratin gene in the irradiated cells to stimulate differentiation toward better differentiated cells., CONCLUSIONS: HDRILBT may cause the keratin gene in the irradiated cells to induce differentiation toward better differentiated cells.

Method(s): Patients who completed definitive radiotherapy (RT) for oropharyngeal cancer and had blood counts taken pre-RT from 2002 to 2013 were included. NLR was calculated as total neutrophil/lymphocytes. Survival rates were estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method. Univariable and multivariable analyses were conducted with linear and Cox regression methods. NLR was analysed posteriori and dichotomised on the discovered median. Result(s): Eight hundred and forty-eight patients were analysed. The median pre-RT NLR was 3. Patients with NLR of <3 had improved overall survival (OS) than those with NLR >= 3 (5-year OS 85 vs 74%, p < 0.0001). OS differences remained significant when stratified according to HPV status (HPV-positive p = 0.011; HPV-negative p = 0.003). Freedom from any recurrence (FFR), locoregional control (LRC) and freedom of distant recurrence (FDR) were better in those with NLR < 3. The negative impact of elevated pre-RT NLR on OS (HR = 1.64, p = 0.001), FFR (HR = 1.6, p = 0.006) and LRC (HR = 1.8, p = 0.005) remained significant on multivariable analysis. Conclusion(s): Pre-RT NLR is an independent prognostic factor in patients with oropharyngeal cancer regardless of HPV status.

2896,"Effects of (12)C(6+) ion radiation and ferulic acid on the zebrafish (Danio rerio) embryonic oxidative stress response and gene expression The effects of carbon ion irradiation and ferulic acid (FA) on the induction of oxidative stress and alteration of gene expression were studied in zebrafish (Danio rerio) embryos. Zebrafish embryos at 8 hpf were divided into seven groups: the control group; the 1Gy, 3Gy and 7Gy irradiation groups; and three FA-pre-treated irradiation groups. In the irradiated groups, a significant increase in the teratogenesis of the zebrafish embryos and oxidative stress was accompanied by increased malondialdehyde (MDA) content, decreased glutathione (GSH) content and alterations in antioxidant enzyme activities (such as catalase [CAT] and superoxide dismutase [SOD]). Moreover, the mRNA levels for Cu/Zn-sod, Mn-sod, cat and gpx, the genes encoding these antioxidant proteins, were altered significantly. However, the mRNA expression patterns were not in accordance with those of the antioxidant enzymes and were more sensitive under low-dose irradiation. In addition, we detected the mRNA expression of ucp-2 and bcl-2, which are located at the mitochondrial inner membrane and related to reactive oxidative species (ROS) production. In the irradiated groups, the mRNA level of ucp-2 was significantly increased, whereas the mRNA level of bcl-2 was significantly decreased. Supplementation with FA, an antioxidant, was better able to reduce the irradiation-induced oxidative damage marked by changes in mortality, morphology, antioxidant enzyme activities and the MDA and GSH content, as well as in the mRNA expression levels. Overall, this study provided helpful information about the transcriptional effects of irradiation to better understand the mechanism of carbon ion-induced oxidative stress and FA-induced radioprotective effects.

2067,"Identifying an optimal adjuvant radiotherapy dose for extremity and trunk Merkel cell carcinoma following resection: An analysis of the national cancer database IMPORTANCE: Merkel cell carcinoma (MCC) is a rare and aggressive cutaneous neuroendocrine neoplasm with a high risk of recurrence following resection. Despite a rising incidence over the past 3 decades, there is a paucity of prospective data owing to the rarity of this disease. OBJECTIVE(S): To determine the optimal adjuvant radiation therapy (RT) dose following resection of localized MCC of the extremities or trunk. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Using the National Cancer Database, a large national database consisting of a heterogeneous population and treatment settings, we retrospectively analyzed a cohort of 2093 patients 18 years or older with stage I to III MCC of the extremities and/or trunk treated with definitive surgery and adjuvant RT between 1998 and 2011. Exclusion criteria included receiving treatment with palliative intent, preoperative RT, non-external-beam RT, and radiation dose of 30 Gy or lower or 70 Gy or higher. Cox proportional hazards regression model was used to compare overall survival (OS) between RT dose groups, accounting for age, sex, race, stage, surgery type, margin status, comorbidities, and use of chemotherapy. EXPOSURES: Radiation therapy dose was categorized into 4 groups: group 1 received the lowest dose (>30 to <40 Gy); group 2, the next lowest (40 to <50 Gy); group 3, the second highest dose (50 to 55 Gy); and group 4, the highest dose (>55 to 70 Gy). MAIN OUTCOME AND MEASURE: Overall survival. RESULT(S): Data from 2093 patients were analyzed; there were 1293 men (61.8%) and 800 women (38.2%) (median age, 73 years). After a median follow-up of 37 months for the entire cohort, 904 deaths were reported. The 3-year OS rates for groups 1, 2, 3, and 4 were 41.8%, 69%, 69.2%, and 66%, respectively (omnibus P < .001). Compared with group 3 (50 to 55 Gy), equivalent OS was seen in group 2 (40 to <50 Gy; adjusted hazard ratio [AHR], 0.89; 95% CI, 0.63-1.27; P = .52) and group 4 (>55 to 70 Gy; AHR, 1.18; 95% CI, 0.93-1.48; P = .17), but worse OS was found in group 1 (>30 to <40 Gy; AHR, 2.63; 95% CI, 1.44-4.80; P < .001). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Adjuvant RT dose from 40 to lower than 50 Gy appears adequate for extremities and/or trunk stage I to III MCC, with OS equivalent to that found at higher-dose regimens (>50 to 70 Gy).Copyright © 2017 American Medical Association.

The structure and properties of FACS complex was characterized by FT-IR, 1H NMR, UV, SEM, TEM, DLS and XRD analyses. TEM and DLS results showed that FACS complex has nanostructure and the mean size of particles was unimodal with average diameters in the range of 165-252 nm. Radiolabeling of FACS complex (99mTc-FACS) was done with Technetium-99 m (99mTc). The optimum conditions of labeling were investigated. The labeling yield was 85% at pH = 6 and 30 min reaction time. The effect of time on the stability of 99mTc-FACS complex was studied and the results revealed that it is stable up to 6 h after labeling. Biodistribution studies of 99mTc-FACS complex in Quail showed that it distributed to different organs mainly in blood, liver and kidney. The results revealed that the uptake of 99mTc-FACS in the sexual organs (ovary and ovarian) of female Quail was higher than that in the sexual organs (testes) of male Quail, so 99mTc-FACS could be used to differentiate between them.

All patients had previously undergone external beam radiotherapy (EBRT) with a median dose of 56 Gy (range, 30-70 Gy). The median HDREB dose applied was 15 Gy (range, 5-29 Gy). The median time interval between primary EBRT and reirradiation was 9 months (range, 2-54 months)., RESULTS: After a median follow-up of 6.7 months, the 6-, 12-, and 24-month overall survival rates were 58%, 18%, and 7%, respectively. The median overall survival time was 6.7 months. Local remission was achieved in 73% of patients (n = 30). A total of 24% of patients (n = 10) showed no response or progressive disease within 8 weeks after treatment. In 1 patient, treatment response was not documented. The 6-, 12-, and 24-month local control rates were 38%, 17%, and 3%, respectively. The median local progression-free survival time was 4 months (range, 1-23 months). Prognostic factors were a total dose of >or=15 Gy of HDREB (p = 0.029) and a Karnofsky performance score of >or=80% (p = 0.0012). The cause of death was locoregional progression in 27% of patients (n = 11), distant metastases in 24% of patients (n = 10), fatal hemorrhage in 15% of patients (n = 6), and other causes in 29% of patients (n = 12).

465,"Lack of correlation between basal cell survival and gross response in irradiated swine skin The relationship between basal cell survival and gross response in irradiated swine skin was tested by comparing dose survival curves derived from time-dose isoeffect data with curves obtained directly from basal cell counts in histological sections. Assuming equal effect per exposure and constant cell survival at isoeffect, best-fitting single-hit multi-target and linear-quadratic response curves were determined for time-dose schedules resulting in non-healing of 50% of irradiated fields. Basal cell survivals for single doses of 970, 1649, 2231, and 2619 rad were estimated 1) by counting regenerating islands and 2) by monitoring total basal cell counts through time. The dose survival curve derived from the isoeffect data was steeper than the curve obtained from direct basal cell counts. Furthermore, the direct basal cell survival curve extrapolates to less than 100% at zero dose, indicating the presence of a resistant basal cell subpopulation. The data show that the isoeffect in this case is not strongly coupled to basal cell survival. Rather, the probability of healing of an irradiated field is more sensitive to the dose per fraction than is basal cell survival, implying a contribution to non-healing from damage to stromal elements such as the capillary endothelium.",Included

Platelet aggregation after adenosine diphosphate stimulation was studied in the platelet rich plasma obtained from 37 patients who underwent left ventriculography using the highly sensitive method of particle counting with laser-light scattering. Platelet activation by contrast media was studied in the platelet rich plasma from healthy volunteers using flow cytometric analysis to detect platelet degranulation as P-selectin expression. There was a significant decrease in platelet aggregation in patients injected with ioxilan or iomeprol compared with patients injected with iohexol. There was a significant increase in P-selectin expression with the three groups of contrast media compared to control. The platelet activation with ioxilan or iomeprol was significantly less compared to the activation with iohexol. The comparison showed that previous generalization regarding platelet activation by nonionic contrast media might not be valid. It is presumed that the higher osmolality of iohexol may contribute to the increase in platelet aggregation and activation.",Excluded
2004,"The effect of exposure duration on the biological activity of mobile telephony radiation In the present experiments we studied the effects of different durations of a single (continuous), daily exposure, ranging from 1 min up to 21 min, to the two established systems of digital mobile telephony radiation that are commonly used in Europe, viz. GSM 900 MHz (Global System for Mobile telecommunications) and DCS 1800 MHz (Digital Cellular System-referred to also as GSM 1800 MHz), on a well-tested biological model, the reproductive capacity of the insect Drosophila melanogaster. The insects were exposed to each type of radiation at an intensity of about 10 microW/cm(2), corresponding to a distance of 20 or 30 cm from the antenna of a DCS 1800 or a GSM 900 mobile phone handset, respectively. At these distances the bioactivity of mobile telephony radiation was found to be at a maximum due to the existence of a ""window"" of increased bioactivity around this value, as we have shown recently [1-4]. The results show that the reproductive capacity decreases almost linearly with increasing exposure duration to both GSM 900 and DCS 1800 radiation, suggesting that short-term exposures to these radiations have cumulative effects on living organisms. Additionally, our results show again that GSM 900 MHz radiation is slightly more bioactive than DCS 1800 MHz radiation, at the same exposure durations and under equal radiation intensities, as shown in our previous experiments [5].

3084,"Trends in the incidence of sudden deaths and heart diseases in fukushima after the great east Japan earthquake On March 11, 2011, a great earthquake, known as the Great East Japan Earthquake, hit northeastern Japan, resulting in a tsunami that caused a nuclear disaster, the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant accident, forcing about 160,000 people to evacuate. We, therefore, sought to examine the effects of this evacuation on the onset of cardiovascular diseases and sudden death (SD) in Fukushima Prefecture, three years after the earthquake. We divided the evacuation zone into two areas, whole evacuation zone (Area 1) and partial evacuation zone (Area 2), and we defined the north district of the prefecture as the control area (Area 3). We cross-referenced the death certificate data with data from the Fukushima Prefecture acute myocardial infarction registration survey. For each area, we tallied the number of people who fell into the SD, myocardial infarction (MI), and MI suspected groups. We calculated the age-adjusted incidence rates and analyzed the differences in the adjusted incidence rates across three years using a Poisson regression model. The age-adjusted death rate of the SD group was significantly higher in 2011 in all areas than in 2012 or 2013 (P < 0.05). The total death rate was higher in Area 1 in March 2011, just after the disaster, than in the other two areas. The rate of SD was also higher in Area 1 than in the other areas in March 2011. The incidence of sudden cardiac death might have increased just after the Great East Japan Earthquake in the evacuation area, but not in other areas in Fukushima Prefecture.Copyright © 2019, International Heart Journal Association.

577,"Texture analysis for the assessment of structural changes in parotid glands induced by radiotherapy BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: During radiotherapy (RT) for head-and-neck cancer, parotid glands undergo significant anatomic, functional and structural changes which could characterize pre-clinical signs of an increased risk of xerostomia. Texture analysis is proposed to assess structural changes of parotids induced by RT, and to investigate whether early variations of textural parameters (such as mean intensity and fractal dimension) can predict parotid shrinkage at the end of treatment., MATERIAL AND METHODS: Textural parameters and volumes of 42 parotids from 21 patients treated with intensity-modulated RT for nasopharyngeal cancer were extracted from CT images. To individuate which parameters changed during RT, a Wilcoxon signed-rank test between textural indices (first and second RT week; first and last RT week) was performed. Discriminant analysis was applied to variations of these parameters in the first two weeks of RT to assess their power in predicting parotid shrinkage at the end of RT., RESULTS: A significant decrease in mean intensity (1.7 HU and 3.8 HU after the second and last weeks, respectively) and fractal dimension (0.016 and 0.021) was found. Discriminant analysis, based on volume and fractal dimension, was able to predict the final parotid shrinkage (accuracy of 71.4%)., CONCLUSION: Textural features could be used in combination with volume to characterize structural modifications on parotid glands and to predict parotid shrinkage at the end of RT.

333,"Integration of functional MRI and white matter tractography in stereotactic radiosurgery clinical practice PURPOSE: To study the efficacy of the integration of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and diffusion tensor imaging tractography data into stereotactic radiosurgery clinical practice., METHODS AND MATERIALS: fMRI and tractography data sets were acquired and fused with corresponding anatomical MR and computed tomography images of patients with arteriovenous malformation (AVM), astrocytoma, brain metastasis, or hemangioma and referred for stereotactic radiosurgery. The acquired data sets were imported into a CyberKnife stereotactic radiosurgery system and used to delineate the target, organs at risk, and nearby functional structures and fiber tracts. Treatment plans with and without the incorporation of the functional structures and the fiber tracts into the optimization process were developed and compared., RESULTS: The nearby functional structures and fiber tracts could receive doses of >50% of the maximum dose if they were excluded from the planning process. In the AVM case, the doses received by the Broadmann-17 structure and the optic tract were reduced to 700 cGy from 1,400 cGy and to 1,200 cGy from 2,000 cGy, respectively, upon inclusion into the optimization process. In the metastasis case, the motor cortex received 850 cGy instead of 1,400 cGy; and in the hemangioma case, the pyramidal tracts received 780 cGy instead of 990 cGy. In the astrocytoma case, the dose to the motor cortex bordering the lesion was reduced to 1,900 cGy from 2,100 cGy, and therefore, the biologically equivalent dose in three fractions was delivered instead., CONCLUSIONS: Functional structures and fiber tracts could receive high doses if they were not considered during treatment planning. With the aid of fMRI and tractography images, they can be delineated and spared. Copyright (c) 2010 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.",Excluded
996,"Detection of pancreatic tumors, image quality, and radiation dose during the pancreatic parenchymal phase: effect of a low-tube-voltage, high-tube-current CT technique--preliminary results PURPOSE: To intraindividually compare a low-tube-voltage (80 kVp), high-tube-current (675 mA) computed tomographic (CT) technique with a high-tube-voltage (140 kVp) CT protocol for the detection of pancreatic tumors, image quality, and radiation dose during the pancreatic parenchymal phase., MATERIALS AND METHODS: This prospective, single-center, HIPAA-compliant study was approved by the institutional review board, and written informed consent was obtained. Twenty-seven patients (nine men, 18 women; mean age, 64 years) with 23 solitary pancreatic tumors underwent dual-energy CT. Two imaging protocols were used: 140 kVp and 385 mA (protocol A) and 80 kVp and 675 mA (protocol B). For both protocols, the following variables were compared during the pancreatic parenchymal phase: contrast enhancement for the aorta, the pancreas, and the portal vein; pancreas-to-tumor contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR); noise; and effective dose. Two blinded, independent readers qualitatively scored the two data sets for tumor detection and image quality. Random-effect analysis of variance tests were used to compare differences between the two protocols., RESULTS: Compared with protocol A, protocol B yielded significantly higher contrast enhancement for the aorta (508.6 HU vs 221.5 HU, respectively), pancreas (151.2 HU vs 67.0 HU), and portal vein (189.7 HU vs 87.3 HU), along with a greater pancreas-to-tumor CNR (8.1 vs 5.9) (P < .001 for all comparisons). No statistically significant difference in tumor detection was observed between the two protocols. Although standard deviation of image noise increased with protocol B (11.5 HU vs 18.6 HU), this protocol significantly reduced the effective dose (from 18.5 to 5.1 mSv; P < .001)., CONCLUSION: A low-tube-voltage, high-tube-current CT technique has the potential to improve the enhancement of the pancreas and peripancreatic vasculature, improve tumor conspicuity, and reduce patient radiation dose during the pancreatic parenchymal phase.",Excluded
1623,"Measuring and assessing individual external doses during the rehabilitation phase in Iitate village after the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant accident After the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant accident in 2011, Iitate village was placed under an evacuation order because the level of radioactive materials drifting from the nuclear plant to the village was above a government-set level for allowing residents to live in the area. The evacuation advisory for most of the village was lifted on 31 March 2017. For displaced residents deciding whether or not to return to their homes, it is important to correctly understand and estimate the realistic individual external doses they will receive after returning to the village. In this study, with the support of residents of the village, we used a personal dosimeter (D-Shuttle) coupled with a global positioning system device to measure and thus understand realistic individual external doses while the residents were in Iitate village and to project the individual external doses for different administrative districts as of 1 April 2017. The measured individual external doses measured by D-Shuttle for 38 study participants showed that the doses measured during time spent inside the village were higher and more widely distributed than the doses measured during time spent outside the village. The exposure ratio (ER) was defined as the ratio of additional individual external dose measured by D-Shuttle to the additional ambient dose based on an airborne monitoring survey. The medians of the average ERs were 0.13 (min-max 0.06-0.27) for time spent at home and 0.18 (min-max 0.08-0.36) for time spent outdoors. Projected additional annual individual external doses as of 1 April 2017 for different administrative districts in the village were calculated using ERs obtained in this study. Assuming that individuals spent 8 h per day on outdoor activities and 16 h on indoor activities, additional annual individual external doses were estimated to be below 3 mSv using the mean of the average ERs for most districts in the village, and these values were well below the individual external doses estimated using the approach taken by the central government. The results of this study provide valuable information both for understanding realistic radiological situations in the village and for those who want to know their future individual external dose in order to make a decision on whether or not to live in the village.",Excluded
2808,"Preparation and evaluation of the rhenium-188-labelled anti-NCA antigen monoclonal antibody BW 250/183 for radioimmunotherapy of leukaemia Anti-NCA antigen antibody BW 250/183 (Anti-Granulocyte) localizes more than 50% of injected antibody dose to the bone marrow. Therefore, this antibody is promising for adjuvant conditioning radioimmunotherapy of bone marrow before bone marrow transplantation. To examine its potential use for radioimmunotherapy, we developed an efficient and reproducible technical protocol for labelling anti-NCA antigen antibody BW 250/183 with generator-produced rhenium-188, aiming at both high radiochemical yield and high specific activity. 188Re-labelled BW 250/183 antibody was used in 12 patients with advanced leukaemia. Labelling of BW 250/183 with 188Re was accomplished by the direct radiolabelling method using tris-(2-carboxyethyl) phosphine (TCEP) as the reducing agent. Twelve patients with recurrent acute or chronic leukaemia were treated with activities of 6.5-12.4 GBq of 188Re-labelled BW 250/183. Standard gamma camera scintigraphy was used to evaluate the biodistribution, and a region of interest analysis together with the MIRDOSE 3.1 software was applied to determine the radiation doses to relevant tissues. The 188Re-BW 250/183 antibody was labelled in high radiochemical yield, with high radiochemical purity (94% +/- 3%) and specific activity (5.55-7.4 GBq/mg) within 1 h. The preliminary biodistribution studies showed persistent uptake of 188Re-BW 250/183 in bone marrow. The radiation absorbed doses (mGy/MBq) delivered to the total body, red marrow, liver, spleen and kidneys were 0.13 +/- 0.02, 1.45 +/- 0.71, 0.43 +/- 0.21, 1.32 +/- 0.99 and 0.71 +/- 0.17, respectively. TCEP reduction enabled the direct, fast and effective labelling of the monoclonal antibody BW 250/183 with 188Re. Preliminary clinical results suggest delivery of a significant radiation dose to bone marrow and thus the potential for adjuvant conditioning therapy before BMT.",Excluded
2907,"Remotely Guided Breast Sonography for Long-Term Space Missions: A Case Report and Discussion Background: Space radiation can cause different types of cancers in crewmembers, especially during long-term space missions. Introduction: To date, a complete bilateral breast ultrasound has not been performed at the International Space Station (ISS). A breast screening imaging technique could be a useful tool for early identification of breast cancer in astronauts. We hypothesized that breast ultrasound performed by a crewmember while being remotely guided by a specialist from the ground could be an essential tool for medical diagnosis in space. This project aimed to test an ultrasound screening protocol for breast tissue using real-time remotely guided telemedicine techniques. Materials and Methods: One female volunteer, with no previous medical experience, performed a self-scanned bilateral breast ultrasound exam guided by a remote sonographer. Dynamic ultrasound images were collected using a 25 mm broadband linear array transducer. To simulate fluid shift on the volunteer during microgravity, the bed was tilted -6. Results: Recorded ultrasound images were analyzed by radiologists, comparing the findings with a gold standard. The experiment demonstrated that real-time remotely guided sonography exam is feasible and can yield meaningful clinical results. Discussion: This case study showed that remotely guided breast ultrasound can be performed and might become an important tool for diagnosis of breast cancer in space missions. Conclusion: The results cannot be generalized based on one subject, and additional research is warranted in this area in addition to its validation on the ISS. This technique, however, has potential for use as part of preventive medicine procedures for long-term space missions at the ISS, and eventually for human settlements on the Moon and Mars.

We found that, on average, the density of epidermal melanocytes 14 days after exposure to 2 minimal erythemal dose (MED) SSUVR was twofold higher than baseline (unirradiated) skin. However, the change in epidermal melanocyte counts among people carrying germline MC1R variants (97% increase) was significantly less than those with wild-type MC1R (164% increase; P = 0.01). We also found that sunscreen applied to the skin before exposure to 2 MED SSUVR completely blocked the effects of DNA damage, p53 induction, and cellular proliferation in both melanocytes and keratinocytes. © 2013 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

1078,"Polymorphisms of DNA damage response genes in radiation-related and sporadic papillary thyroid carcinoma Papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC) etiologically occurs as a radiation-induced or sporadic malignancy. Genetic factors contributing to the susceptibility to either form remain unknown. In this retrospective case-control study, we evaluated possible associations between single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the candidate DNA damage response genes (ATM, XRCC1, TP53, XRCC3, MTF1) and risk of radiation-induced and sporadic PTC. A total of 255 PTC cases (123 Chernobyl radiation-induced and 132 sporadic, all in Caucasians) and 596 healthy controls (198 residents of Chernobyl areas and 398 subjects without history of radiation exposure, all Caucasians) were genotyped. The risk of PTC and SNPs interactions with radiation exposure were assessed by logistic regressions. The ATM G5557A and XRCC1 Arg399Gln polymorphisms, regardless of radiation exposure, associated with a decreased risk of PTC according to the multiplicative and dominant models of inheritance (odds ratio (OR) = 0.69, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.45-0.86 and OR = 0.70, 95% CI 0.59-0.93 respectively). The ATM IVS22-77 T > C and TP53 Arg72Pro SNPs interacted with radiation (P = 0.04 and P = 0.01 respectively). ATM IVS22-77 associated with the increased risk of sporadic PTC (OR = 1.84, 95% CI 1.10-3.24) whereas TP53 Arg72Pro correlated with the higher risk of radiogenic PTC (OR = 1.80, 95% CI 1.06-2.36). In the analyses of ATM/TP53 (rs1801516/rs664677/rs609429/rs1042522) combinations, the GG/TC/CG/GC genotype strongly associated with radiation-induced PTC (OR = 2.10, 95% CI 1.17-3.78). The GG/CC/GG/GG genotype displayed a significantly increased risk for sporadic PTC (OR = 3.32, 95% CI 1.57-6.99).

744,"Insufficient Vitamin D Response to Solar Radiation in German Patients with Type 2 Diabetes or Gestational Diabetes Vitamin D deficiency is highly prevalent in all forms of diabetes mellitus. Recently, we reported how ultraviolet B (UVB) radiation affected vitamin D [25(OH)D3] concentrations in patients with type 1 diabetes. Our aim was to analyze whether patients with non-autoimmune diabetes, such as type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) also show the same vitamin D profile in relation to environmental factors including ambient temperature as an indirect parameter for outdoor activities. We analyzed 25(OH)D3 concentrations of T2DM (n=349) and GDM patients (n=327) at the University Hospital Frankfurt from 2005 to 2007. Additionally, daily UVB and monthly outside air temperature measurements for Frankfurt/Germany were obtained. We detected a positive correlation between UVB irradiation and 25(OH)D3 concentrations of T2DM and GDM patients (rho=0.50 and rho=0.63, p=0.003 and p<0.0001, respectively). UVB irradiation was in summer (April-October) higher than in winter (November-March) (5.6 kJ/m vs. 0.5 kJ/m, p<0.0001). However, the prevalence of vitamin D deficiency in summer remained high with 76% in T2DM and 59% in GDM. In a stepwise regression analysis for the 25(OH)D3 concentration, significant predictors were outdoor temperature (estimate=0.02, p<0.0001), UVB radiation (estimate=-0.0015, p=0.02), year (2006 vs. 2005 estimate=-0.06, p>0.05, 2007 vs. 2005: estimate=-0.13, p<0.0001) and diabetes type (estimate=0.06, p=0.03). In conclusion, the strong correlation between UVB radiation and 25(OH)D3 concentrations in T2DM and GDM patients determines the seasonal variation. Additional determinants for the 25(OH)D3 concentrations were outdoor temperature, year, and diabetes type. Despite the effects of solar radiation both patients groups remain largely vitamin D deficient during summers.Copyright © Georg Thieme Verlag KG Stuttgart, New York.",Excluded
351,"Radiation dose response estimation with emphasis on low dose range using restricted cubic splines: application to all solid cancer mortality data, 1950-2003, in atomic bomb survivors Using the all solid cancer mortality data set of the Life Span Study (LSS) cohort from 1950 to 2003 (LSS Report 14) data among atomic bomb survivors, excess relative risk (ERR) statistical analyses were performed using the second degree polynomial and the threshold and restricted cubic spline (RCS) dose response models. For the RCS models with 3 to 7 knots of equally spaced percentiles with margins in the dose range greater than 50 mGy, the dose response was assumed to be linear at less than 70 to 90 mGy. Due to the skewed dose distribution of atomic bomb survivors, the current knot system for the RCS analysis results in a detailed depiction of the dose response as less than approximately 0.5 Gy. The 6 knot RCS models for the all-solid cancer mortality dose response of the whole dose or less than 2 Gy were selected with the AIC model selection criterion and fit significantly better (p < 0.05) than the linear (L) model. The usual RCS includes the L-global model but not the quadratic (Q) nor linear-quadratic (LQ) global models. The authors extended the RCS to include L or LQ global models by putting L or LQ constraints on the cubic spline in the lower and upper tails, and the best RCS model selected with AIC criterion was the usual RCS with L-constraints in both the lower and upper tails. The selected RCS had a linear dose-response model in the lower dose range (i.e., < 0.2-0.3 Gy) and was compatible with the linear no-threshold (LNT) model in this dose range. The proposed method is also useful in describing the dose response of a specific cancer or non-cancer disease incidence/mortality.",Excluded
3422,"Cell Salvage During Liver Transplantation for Hepatocellular Carcinoma: A Retrospective Analysis of Tumor Recurrence Following Irradiation of the Salvaged Blood BACKGROUND: Orthotopic liver transplantation (OLT) is the treatment option for early-stage hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). OLT is often associated with high blood loss, requiring blood transfusion. Retransfusion of autologous blood is a key part of blood conservation. There are, however, concerns that the retransfusion of salvaged blood might cause the spread of cancer cells and induce metastasis. Irradiation of salvaged blood before retransfusion eliminates viable cancer cells. Here, we analyzed the incidence of tumor recurrence in patients with HCC undergoing OLT who received irradiated cell-salvaged blood during transplant surgery., METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed patients undergoing OLT for HCC between 2002 and 2018 at our center. We compared the tumour recurrence in patients who received no retransfusion of autologous blood with patients who received autologous blood with or without preceding irradiation of the blood., RESULTS: Fifty-one (40 male, 11 female) patients were included in the analysis; 10 patients developed tumor recurrence within a time period of 2.45 +/- 2.0 years. Statistical analysis revealed that there was no significant difference in tumor recurrence between patients who received autologous blood with or without irradiation., CONCLUSION: Intraoperative transfusion of cell-salvaged blood did not increase tumor recurrence rates. Cell salvage should be used in liver transplantation of HCC patients as part of a blood conservation strategy. The effect of blood irradiation on tumor recurrence could not be definitively evaluated.

The aim of this study was to investigate long-term clinical outcome and stent patency. Twenty patients were treated with venous stenting for benign disease at our institution between 1987 and 2005. Fifteen of 20 patients (15 female, mean age at time of stent implantation 38 years [range 18-66]) returned for a clinical visit, a plain X-ray of the stent, and a Duplex ultrasound. Four patients were lost to follow-up, and one patient died 277 months after stent placement although a good clinical result was documented 267 months after stent placement. Mean follow-up after stent placement was 167.8 months (13.9 years) (range 71 (6 years) to 267 months [22 years]). No patient needed an additional venous intervention after stent implantation. No significant difference between the circumference of the thigh on the stented side (mean 55.1 cm [range 47.0-70.0]) compared with the contralateral thigh (mean 54.9 cm [range 47.0-70.0]) (p = 0.684) was seen.

1011,"Cetuximab plus cisplatin, irinotecan, and thoracic radiotherapy as definitive treatment for locally advanced, unresectable esophageal cancer: A phase-II study of the SWOG (S0414) Introduction: The specific aims of the study were to evaluate the 2-year overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS), toxicity profile, and best objective response rate in patients with locally advanced, clinically unresectable esophageal cancer receiving cetuximab, cisplatin, irinotecan, and thoracic radiotherapy (TRT) within a multi-institutional cooperative-group setting. Method(s): Eligible patients (cT4 M0 or medically unresectable, biopsy proven, and noncervical esophageal cancer) were to receive four 21-day cycles of cetuximab 400 mg/m2 (day 1, cycle 1), cetuximab 250 mg/m2 (day 8, 15, cycle 1; then days 1, 8, and 15 for subsequent cycles), cisplatin 30 mg/m2 (days 1 and 8, all cycles), and irinotecan 65 mg/m 2 (days 1 and 8, all cycles). TRT was administered at 1.8 Gy in 28 daily fractions to a total dose of 50.4 Gy, to begin with on day 1 of cycle 3. The primary endpoint was 2-year OS, with an accrual goal of 75 patients with adenocarcinoma. Result(s): The study was closed because of slow accrual, with 21 eligible patients (11 squamous, 10 adenocarcinoma) enrolled from May 2005 to September 2007. Two-year OS and PFS (95% confidence interval [CI]) were 33.3% (14.6-57.0%) and 23.8% (8.2-47.2%), respectively. Kaplan-Meier estimates of median (95% CI) OS and PFS were 11.2 (6.4-43.6) and 6.4 (3.7-12.0) months, respectively. The overall response rate (95% CI) among 17 evaluable patients was 17.6% (3.8-43.4%), including 6% confirmed complete responders and 12% unconfirmed partial responders. Two deaths resulted from protocol treatment (sudden death and gastrointestinal necrosis). Ten (47.6%) and 6 (28.6%) patients had grade-3 or -4 toxicity, respectively: 52.4% were hematologic, 23.8% had fatigue, 19.0% had nausea, 19.0% had dehydration, and 19.0% had anorexia. Conclusion(s): Concomitant cetuximab, cisplatin, irinotecan, and TRT were poorly tolerated in the first North American cooperative group trial testing this regimen for locally advanced esophageal cancer as treatment-related mortality approached 10%. Single-institution phase-II cetuximab-based combined modality trials have yielded encouraging results in preliminary analyses.

A questionnaire was used to evaluate the patients'comments of xerostomia condition. Radiotherapy treatment plans of the participants were retrieved from the Eclipse treatment planning system from which the radiation doses delivered to the parotid glands were estimated. The correlations of parotid gland doses and the post-RT changes were evaluated. Result(s): The post-RT parotid glands were significantly smaller (p<0.001) than the pre-RT ones. They also demonstrated lower vascular velocity, resistive and pulsatility indices (p<0.05) than normal participants. The degree of volume shrinkage and subjective severity of xerostomia demonstrated dose dependence, but such dependence was not definite in the haemodynamic changes. Conclusion(s): It was possible to predict the gland volume change and subjective severity of xerostomia based on the dose to the parotid glands for NPC patients. However, such prediction was not effective for the vascular changes. The damage to the gland was long lasting and had significant effects on the patients' quality of life. © 2011 The British Institute of Radiology.",Included

1284,"Carotid intima-medial thickness as a marker of radiation-induced carotid atherosclerosis PURPOSE: Arterial thickening is a precursor to atherosclerosis. Carotid intima-medial thickness (CIMT), a measure of arterial thickening, is a validated surrogate for prediction of cerebrovascular events. This study investigates CIMT as an early marker of radiation-induced carotid artery damage., MATERIALS/METHODS: Head and neck cancer patients treated with radiotherapy (RT) (minimum dose of 50 Gy) to one side of the neck (unirradiated side as control) at least 2 years previously were included. CIMT was measured in 4 arterial segments: proximal, mid, distal common carotid artery (CCA), and bifurcation and were compared to corresponding unirradiated segments. CIMT measurements >75th percentile of a reference population were considered abnormal and at increased cerebrovascular risk., RESULTS: 50 patients (34 males) with a median age of 58 years (interquartile range (IQR) 50-62) were included. The mean maximum dose to the irradiated and unirradiated artery was 53 Gy (standard deviation (SD) 13 Gy) and 1.9 Gy (SD 3.7 Gy), respectively. Mean CIMT was significantly greater in irradiated versus unirradiated arteries: proximal CCA (0.76 mm +/- 0.15 vs 0.68 mm +/- 0.14 (p<0.0001), mid CCA (0.74 mm +/- 0.2 vs 0.68 mm +/- 0.16 (p=0.01), distal CCA (0.77 mm +/- 0.2 vs 0.68 mm +/- 0.15 (p=0.004), and bifurcation (0.85 mm +/- 0.25 vs 0.72 mm +/- 0.17 (p=0.001). For all arterial segments, a significantly greater number of CIMT measurements were abnormal on the irradiated side (proximal: p=0.004, mid: p=0.05, distal: p=0.005, bifurcation: p=0.03). There was no effect of time from RT, age, smoking status, surgery and chemotherapy on CIMT difference (irradiated-unirradiated) in all segments., CONCLUSIONS: CIMT is increased after RT and may be a useful marker of radiation-induced carotid atherosclerosis. There appears to be no additional effect of other atherosclerotic risk factors on CIMT following RT. Copyright © 2015 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.",Excluded

2856,"Further validation to support clinical translation of [18F]FTC-146 for imaging sigma-1 receptors Background: This study aims to further evaluate the specificity and selectivity of [18F]FTC-146 and obtain additional data to support its clinical translation. Method(s): The binding of [19F]FTC-146 to vesicular acetylcholine transporter (VAChT) was evaluated using [3H]vesamicol and PC12A123.7 cells in an in vitro binding assay. The uptake and kinetics of [18F]FTC-146 in S1R-knockout mice (S1R-KO) compared to wild-type (WT) littermates was assessed using dynamic positron emission tomography (PET) imaging. Ex vivo autoradiography and histology were conducted using a separate cohort of S1R-KO/WT mice, and radiation dosimetry was calculated from WT mouse data (extrapolated for human dosing). Toxicity studies in Sprague-Dawley rats were performed with a dose equivalent to 250x the anticipated clinical dose of [19F]FTC-146 mass. Results and discussion: VAChT binding assay results verified that [19F]FTC-146 displays negligible affinity for VAChT (Ki = 450 +/- 80 nM) compared to S1R. PET images demonstrated significantly higher tracer uptake in WT vs. S1R-KO brain (4.57 +/- 1.07 vs. 1.34 +/- 0.4 %ID/g at 20-25 min, n = 4, p < 0.05). In S1R-KO mice, it was shown that rapid brain uptake and clearance 10 min post-injection, which are consistent with previous S1R-blocking studies in mice. Three- to fourfold higher tracer uptake was observed in WT relative to S1R-KO mouse brains by ex vivo autoradiography. S1R staining coincided well with the autoradiographic data in all examined brain regions (r2 = 0.85-0.95). Biodistribution results further demonstrated high [18F]FTC-146 accumulation in WT relative to KO mouse brain and provided quantitative information concerning tracer uptake in S1R-rich organs (e.g., heart, lung, pancreas) for WT mice vs. age-matched S1R-KO mice. The maximum allowed dose per scan in humans as extrapolated from mouse dosimetry was 33.19 mCi (1228.03 MBq). No significant toxicity was observed even at a 250X dose of the maximum carrier mass [19F]FTC-146 expected to be injected for human studies. Conclusion(s): Together, these data indicate that [18F]FTC-146 binds specifically to S1Rs and is a highly promising radiotracer ready for clinical translation to investigate S1R-related diseases.Copyright © 2015, Shen et al.",Excluded
732,"Ultrasonography-guided percutaneous nephrolithotomy Purpose: To evaluate the safety and efficacy of ultrasound-guided percutaneous nephrolithotomy (PCNL). Patients and Methods: Between August 2003 and December 2007, 47 patients were treated, 29 men and 18 women, with a mean age of 33.4 years (range 2167 yrs) and a mean stone size of 31.5mm (range 2446mm). All stones were located in the renal pelvis with mild to moderate hydronephrosis seen on intravenous urography. A ureteral stent was inserted cystoscopically, and saline was injected for more localization of the pelvicaliceal system (PCS), if needed. Puncture of the PCS was performed with an 18-gauge nephrostomy needle through the lower pole calyx, and all the stages, including dilatation, were performed under ultrasonography guidance. Result(s): Thirty-nine patients were stone free in the kidneys, ureters, and bladder the day after the operation. Five patients had multiple fragments that measured about 4 to 5mm, which passed in 4 weeks (total stone-free rate: 93.61%); failure occurred in two patients, and fluoroscopy was needed; two patients who had residual fragments that measured 10 and 12mm underwent shockwave lithotripsy; and in one patient, a fragment that measured 7 to 8mm migrated into the ureterit fragmented and was removed with a ureteroscope 2 days after the operation. Conclusion(s): PCNL using sonography is a good alternative to the fluoroscopic method. It is performed without radiation exposure to the surgeon and patient; however, more experience is needed.

2700,"Localized sinonasal mucosal melanoma: Outcomes and associations with stage, radiotherapy, and positron emission tomography response Background: Sinonasal mucosal melanoma is a rare neoplasm with a poor prognosis. Method(s): Retrospective analysis was conducted on 78 patients with localized sinonasal mucosal melanoma treated at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center (MSKCC from 1998-2013). Demographic, tumor, imaging, and treatment factors were recorded and survival and disease-control outcomes were analyzed. Result(s): Median overall survival (OS) and disease-specific survival (DSS) were 32 and 50 months, respectively. Median locoregional recurrence-free survival (LRFS) and distant recurrence-free survival (DRFS) were 43 and 12 months, respectively. Multivariate analysis demonstrated greater OS in nasal cavity tumors and earlier T classification. Radiotherapy (RT) was associated with significantly greater LRFS (5-years; 35% vs 59%; p =.01), but no difference in OS. Post-RT positron emission tomography (PET) response was associated with greater OS. Conclusion(s): Distant metastasis is the predominant mode of recurrence in sinonasal mucosal melanoma, but local recurrence remains common. RT is associated with improved local control, but no survival benefit. The prognostic value of post-RT PET imaging warrants further investigation. © 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

1542,"Real world outcomes of combination and timing of immunotherapy with radiotherapy for melanoma with brain metastases Introduction: Immunotherapy (IT) and radiotherapy (RT) have improved overall survival in patients with melanoma with brain metastasis (MBM). We examined the real-world survival impact of IT and RT combination and timing strategies. Material(s) and Method(s): From the facility-based National Cancer Database (NCDB) data set, 3008 cases of MBM were identified between 2011 and 2015. Six treatment cohorts were identified: stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) + IT, SRS alone, whole brain radiotherapy (WBRT) + IT, WBRT alone, IT alone, and none. Concurrent therapy was defined as IT given within 28 days before or after RT; nonconcurrent defined as IT administered within 28-90 days of RT. The co-primary outcomes were propensity score-adjusted overall survival by treatment regimen and overall survival by RT and IT timing. Result(s): Median overall survival (mOS) was performed for each treatment category; SRS +IT 15.77 m; (95%CI 12.13-21.29), SRS alone (9.33 m; 95%CI: 8.0-11.3), IT alone (7.29 m; 95%CI: 5.35-12.91), WBRT +IT (4.89 m; 95%CI: 3.65-5.92), No RT or IT (3.29 m; 95%CI: 2.96-3.75), and WBRT alone (3.12 m; 95%CI 2.79-3.52). By propensity score matching, mOS for SRS +IT (15.5 m; 95%CI: 11.5-20.2) was greater than SRS alone (10.1 m; 95%CI: 8.4-11.8) (p = 0.010), and median survival for WBRT +IT (4.6 m; 95%CI: 3.4-5.6) was greater than WBRT alone (2.9 m; 95%CI: 2.5-3.5) (p < 0.001). In the SRS +IT group, 24-month landmark survival was 47% (95%CI; 42-52) for concurrent versus 37% (95%CI; 30-44) for nonconcurrent (p = 0.40). Conclusion(s): Those who received IT in addition to WBRT and SRS experienced longer survival compared to RT modalities alone, while those receiving concurrent SRS and IT trended toward improved survival versus nonconcurrent therapy.Copyright © 2021 The Authors.

The difference in pathogenicity between irradiated and non-irradiated populations Babesia bovis parasites attenuated by 35 krads gamma irradiation and parasites not exposed to irradiation, were injected into intact 2-year-old Hereford steers. All five animals receiving non-irradiated blood died but the five animals which received irradiated blood were only mildly affected. Highly significant differences were observed in changes to plasma fibrinogen, serum fibrinogen-like proteins, packed cell volume, partial thromboplastin time, prothrombin time, blood kinins, and plasma kininogen levels in the control animals but non-significant changes in these parameters occurred in the group receiving iradiated blood. Significant changes in the antiplasmin alpha 2M, and the antithrombin levels occurred in control cattle but not in the group receiving irradiated blood. Parasite multiplications rates and maximum parasitaemias were similar in both groups. Irradiation reduced the dose of living parasites from 1 x 10(8) to 2.5 x 10(3), but this was not the reason for the mild reactions. It was concluded that irradiation had selected an avirulent parasite population.",Included
2550,"Characteristics of High-Performing Radiologists Within Medicare Quality Programs Purpose: The aim of this study was to assess radiologists' performance on Medicare quality measures and identify physician characteristics potentially influencing such scores. Method(s): Medicare quality scores reported by US radiologists in 2015 were obtained from CMS. Associations were explored with publicly available physician characteristic data. Result(s): Overall, 15,045 radiologists reported 40,427 Medicare quality scores encompassing 25 claims measures, 18 registry measures, and 2 qualified clinical data registry (QCDR) measures. Claims measures included reporting fluoroscopic times (n = 10,152; mean score, 80.3 +/- 27.6), carotid ultrasound stenosis (n = 8,940; mean score, 86.8 +/- 20.6), inappropriate mammography use of ""probably benign"" (n = 8,083; mean score, 0.4 +/- 3.3), mammography reminders (n = 7,229; mean score, 86.6 +/- 29.0), bone scintigraphy correlation (n = 2,712; mean score, 76.0 +/- 27.0), and line-related infection prevention (n = 2,226; mean score, 83.3 +/- 27.4). Registry measures were reported by <=17 radiologists. The two QCDR measures were dose index registry participation (n = 246; mean score, 99.5 +/- 1.4) and mammography recall rate (n = 77; mean score, 9.0 +/- 5.6). Higher scores were observed for radiologists in larger practices (strongest independent predictor), in subspecialized practices, in academic practices, in the South and West, and with fewer years in practice. The fluoroscopic exposure times measure had the best performance scores by musculoskeletal and interventional radiologists, carotid Doppler measure by abdominal radiologists, mammography measures by breast radiologists, bone scintigraphy measure by musculoskeletal and nuclear medicine radiologists, and line infection measure by interventionalists. The dose registry participation QCDR measure had near perfect performance across generalists and subspecialists. Conclusion(s): Current Medicare performance metrics favor radiologists in larger practices and subspecialized radiologists, possibly reflecting support infrastructures and the narrow focus of most metrics, respectively. These findings may assist targeted data-driven reporting by radiologists and guide efforts to refine existing and develop new metrics.Copyright © 2018 American College of Radiology",Excluded
159,"Subthalamic nucleus deep brain stimulation improves deglutition in Parkinson's disease Relatively little is known about the role of the basal ganglia in human deglutition. Deep brain stimulation (DBS) affords us a model for examining deglutition in humans with known impairment of the basal ganglia. The purpose of this study was to examine the effects of subthalamic nuclei (STN) DBS on the oral and pharyngeal stages of deglutition in individuals with Parkinson's Disease (PD). It was hypothesized that DBS would be associated with improved deglutition. Within participant, comparisons were made between DBS in the ON and OFF conditions using the dependent variables: pharyngeal transit time, maximal hyoid bone excursion, oral total composite score, and pharyngeal total composite score. Significant improvement occurred for the pharyngeal composite score and pharyngeal transit time in the DBS ON condition compared with DBS OFF. Stimulation of the STN may excite thalamocortical or brainstem targets to sufficiently overcome the bradykinesia/hypokinesia associated with PD and return some pharyngeal stage motor patterns to performance levels approximating those of normal"" deglutition. However, the degree of hyoid bone excursion and oral stage measures did not improve, suggesting that these motor acts may be under the control of different sensorimotor pathways within the basal ganglia.

2337,"Defining Radioiodine-Refractory Differentiated Thyroid Cancer: Efficacy and Safety of Lenvatinib by Radioiodine-Refractory Criteria in the SELECT Trial Background: While there is a clear consensus for defining radioiodine-refractory differentiated thyroid cancer (RR-DTC), it is unknown whether these criteria are equally valid for determining when radioiodine (RAI) therapy is no longer beneficial and systemic treatment should be considered. Lenvatinib, a multikinase inhibitor, significantly prolonged progression-free survival (PFS) compared to placebo in a Phase 3 trial in RR-DTC (SELECT; hazard ratio [HR]: 0.21 [99% confidence interval (CI) 0.14-0.31]; p < 0.001). This sub-analysis compared clinical outcomes of lenvatinib-treated patients in SELECT stratified by RR-DTC inclusion criteria. Method(s): In SELECT, patients with measurable RR-DTC and radiologic evidence of disease progression <=13 months prior to study entry were randomized 2:1 to lenvatinib (24 mg/day; 28-day cycle) or placebo. In this analysis, patients were stratified based on the following RR-DTC inclusion criteria: no RAI uptake, disease progression within 12 months of RAI therapy despite RAI avidity at the time of treatment, and extensive (>600 mCi) cumulative RAI exposure. All had disease progression as an inclusion criterion for SELECT. Result(s): Of 392 patients (261 lenvatinib; 131 placebo) enrolled, 275, 235, and 73 patients met the inclusion criteria for no RAI uptake, disease progression despite RAI avidity, and extensive RAI exposure, respectively. There was significant overlap between the patient groups, with 167 (42.6%) patients meeting more than one inclusion criterion. Lenvatinib improved median PFS compared to placebo in all groups (""no RAI uptake"": lenvatinib not quantifiable [NQ; CI 14.8-NQ] vs. placebo, 3.7 months [CI 2.5-5.3]; ""disease progression despite RAI avidity"": lenvatinib 16.5 months [CI 12.8-NQ] vs. placebo, 3.7 months [CI 1.9-5.4]; ""extensive RAI exposure"": lenvatinib 18.7 months [CI 10.7-NQ] vs. placebo, 3.6 months [CI 1.9-5.5]). Objective response rates were 71.8%, 60.0%, and 56.0% for patients with no RAI uptake, disease progression despite RAI avidity, and extensive RAI exposure, respectively. Lenvatinib-related adverse events were similar across groups. Conclusion(s): Comparable efficacy and safety profiles were observed in lenvatinib-treated patients regardless of RR-DTC criteria, possibly because of a large overlap among patients fulfilling each criterion. However, differing definitions for RR-DTC may be equally valid because both lenvatinib and placebo arms exhibited similar PFS outcomes across groups.© Copyright 2017, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.",Excluded
3021,"Low Intensity laser therapy in patients with burning mouth syndrome: a randomized, placebo-controlled study The aim of this study was to assess the effectiveness of low intensity laser therapy in patients with Burning Mouth Syndrome (BMS). Thirty BMS subjects were randomized into two groups - Laser (LG) and Placebo (CG). Seven patients dropped out, leaving 13 patients in LG and 10 patients in CG. Each patient received 4 irradiations (laser or placebo) twice a week, for two consecutive weeks (blinded to the type of irradiation received). Infrared laser (AsGaAI) irradiations were applied to the affected mucosa in scanning mode, wavelength of 790 nm, output power of 20 mW and fluence of 6 J/cm2. A visual analogue scale (VAS) was used to assess the therapeutic effect before and after each irradiation, and at all the control time periods: 7, 14, 30, 60 and 90 days after the last irradiation. One researcher delivered irradiation and another recorded the results. Both researchers were blinded, the first to the results, and the second to the type of radiation applied. The results were categorized according to the percentage of symptom level variation, and showed a statistically better response in LG in only two categories of the control checkpoints (p=0.02; Fisher's Exact Test). According to the protocol used in this study, low intensity laser therapy is as beneficial to patients with BMS as placebo treatment, indicating a great emotional component of involvement in BMS symptomatology.

24,"Assessment of periodontal changes in patients undergoing radiotherapy for head and neck malignancy: A hospital-based study Background: Surgical resection, radio and chemotherapy, either used singly or in combination, are the three most common modalities used in head and neck cancer treatment. These modalities are effective in eradicating the tumor; they also negatively impact the normal head and neck structures surrounding the tumor. Direct damage to the oral structures (soft and hard tissue) frequently occurs from radio and chemotherapy, and indirect damage may also arise from systemic toxicity. Material(s) and Method(s): This prospective study was designed to analyze the effect of radiotherapy on periodontal parameters in oncology patients prior to irradiation in the head and neck area, compared with 6 months following treatment. The statistical analysis was done using SPSS. Result(s): The study sample consisted of total 29 patients of head and neck malignancy (M = 17, F = 12), of mean age 45.66 years. Only 22% of patients had various habits (smoking, tobacco chewing, and alcohol consumption) and majority (27.59% patients) had tongue malignancy. All periodontal parameters-oral hygiene index Siller (OHIS), clinical attachment level (CAL), gingival recession (GR), except probing pocket depth (PPD)-were significantly increased after radiotherapy. When comparison was made between doses and fractions, only in mandible statistically significant difference were observed in GR. Conclusion(s): Although there was no significant change in PPD, there was increased GR, CAL, and plaque index associated with radiotherapy. In this study, 61.5% cases of mandibular teeth and 34.4% cases of maxillary teeth showed attachment loss greater than 0.2 mm.

645,"Dna damage and repair: Fruit and vegetable effects in a feeding trial Epidemiologic studies have examined the association between fruit and vegetable (F&V) consumption and the risk of cancer. Several cancer-preventive mechanisms have been proposed, such as antioxidant properties and modulation of biotransformation enzyme activities; both may be associated with reducing DNA damage and hence the mutation rate. We investigated, in a randomized, controlled, crossover feeding trial, the effect of 10 servings/day of botanically defined F&V for 2 wk on endogenous DNA damage; resistance to gamma-irradiation damage; and DNA repair capacity in lymphocytes, measured by the Comet assay. We also explored the association between the UGT1A1*28 polymorphism and serum bilirubin concentrations and DNA damage and repair measures. Healthy men (n = 11) and women (n = 17), age 20 to 40 yr, provided blood samples at the end of each feeding period. Overall, F&V did not affect DNA damage and repair measures in lymphocytes. The number of UGT1A1*28 alleles was inversely associated with sensitivity to gamma-irradiation exposure and DNA repair capacity, but a biological mechanism to explain this association is unclear. A larger sample size is needed to investigate the association between bilirubin concentrations and endogenous DNA damage. With inconsistent findings in the literature, additional dietary intervention studies on the effect of F&V on DNA damage and repair are needed.

1455,"Survival in small cell lung cancer in India: Prognostic utility of clinical features, laboratory parameters and response to treatment BACKGROUND: Predictors of survival and response to treatment in patients with small cell lung cancer (SCLC) are ill-defined and unclear. In an attempt to assess the impact of common presenting symptoms and laboratory values on survival, we undertook this retrospective review of patients with SCLC. To our knowledge, there is no study on survival in SCLC patients from the Indian subcontinent. DESIGN: Retrospective Cohort study. MATERIALS AND METHODS: All newly diagnosed small cell lung cancer cases from December 2001 through December 2004, were identified and clinical data on presenting symptoms and laboratory findings from their hospital records, noted. The influence of various pretreatment factors on survival was investigated using Kaplan-Meier plots and Cox multivariate regression model. RESULT(S): 76 subjects were included (84% males, 91% smokers). 57% patients had five or more symptoms at presentation. Cumulative symptom burden was strongly associated with survival ( P =0.02). Survival was also significantly related with Karnofsky performance status (KPS) ( P =0.04), disease extent (P =0.03) and symptomatic response to treatment ( P< 0.001). Patients with higher hemoglobin ( P =0.02), serum sodium ( P =0.04) and serum globulin ( P =0.02), survived significantly longer. By multivariate regression analysis, hemoglobin, KPS and brain metastases, were significant predictors of survival ( P =0.01, P =0.02, P< 0.01 respectively). CONCLUSION(S): Cumulative symptom burden, KPS, disease extent and symptomatic assessment of improvement after treatment, are useful predictors of survival. This has important clinical implications, keeping in view, the infrastructure and cost involved in more objective tests like CT scan, for evaluation of disease extent and prognosis. These findings can provide a simple basis for predicting prognosis in small cell lung cancer, especially in developing countries like ours.",Excluded
3621,"Utilization of chest CT for injured patients during visits to U.S. emergency departments: 2012-2015 Introduction: Increased use of computed tomography (CT) during injury-related Emergency Department (ED) visits has been reported, despite increased awareness of CT radiation exposure risks. We investigated national trends in the use of chest CT during injury-related ED visits between 2012 and 2015. Method(s): Analyzing injury-related ED visits from the 2012-2015 United States (U.S.) National Hospital Ambulatory Medical Care Survey (NHAMCS), we determined the percentage of visits that had a chest CT and the diagnostic yield of these chest CTs for clinically-significant findings. We used survey-weighted multivariable logistic regression to determine which patient and visit characteristics were associated with chest CT use. Result(s): Injury-related visits accounted for 30% of the 135 million yearly ED visits represented in NHAMCS. Of these visits, 817,480 (2%) received a chest CT over the study period. The diagnostic yield was 3.88%. Chest CT utilization did not change significantly from a rate of 1.73% in 2012 to a rate of 2.31% in 2015 (p = 0.14). Multivariate logistic regression demonstrated increased odds of chest CT for patients seen by residents versus by attendings (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] 2.08, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.41-3.08). Patients aged 18-59 and 60+ had higher AORs (5.75, CI 3.44-9.61 and 9.81, CI 5.90-16.33, respectively) than those <18 years of receiving chest CT.

Different international scientific research collaborations currently investigate four population groups chronically exposed to ionizing radiation during the late 1940s and early 1950s in the Russian Federation and in Kazakhstan. In this framework, collaborations have been established to develop cause-of-death registers in each of these four areas for future mortality follow-up purposes with the aim of studying the health effects of ionizing radiation. The emphasis of this effort is on assessing the information sources available, the mechanisms of data collection and coding, and the data quality and completeness of the information collected.

North Central Cancer Treatment Group Per protocol, patients with primary CNS non-Hodgkin's lymphoma in an intergroup phase II trial conducted by the North Central Cancer Treatment Group and the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group had their cognitive functions measured using the Folstein and Folstein Mini-Mental Status Examination (MMSE) and their physical functions measured using the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group Performance Score (PS) at study entry, at each treatment evaluation, and at quarterly intervals thereafter until disease progression or death. Of the 53 eligible participants who began therapy, 46 (87%) had baseline MMSE scores recorded, 36 (68%) had at least one follow-up MMSE, and 32 (60%) had both, while 52 (98%) had baseline PS, 49 (92%) had at least one follow-up PS, and 48 (91%) had both. Patterns of MMSE and PS values over time were studied in each individual, in the group as a whole, in the 20 patients who completed the study regimen, in the 23 who survived more than a year, and in patients who were classified as nonprogressors at each key evaluation. For each patient, all recorded values were plotted versus time, with dates of disease progression and death included, to look for signs of decline in cognitive or physical function preceding adverse events. Long-term declines in scores of both cognitive and physical function were observed in many treated patients with primary CNS non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. Nearly all patients who were alive more than 52 weeks after study entry had a demonstrable decline in cognitive and physical functionality. Such declines may occur before disease progression is documented; they may also occur in some patients who have long-term follow-up without evidence of disease progression. Declining MMSE and PS was a poor predictor of disease progression. There was no association of PS and toxicity. The data from this study demonstrated the considerable difficulties we encountered conducting an ancillary study such as this within a multicenter clinical trial. Firstly, the test instruments written into the protocol were unable to tell if the declines seen were due to disease, treatment, co-morbidity, or other factors.

339,"Prediction of survival by [18F]fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography in patients with locally advanced non-small-cell lung cancer undergoing definitive chemoradiation therapy: results of the ACRIN 6668/RTOG 0235 trial In this prospective National Cancer Institute-funded American College of Radiology Imaging Network/Radiation Therapy Oncology Group cooperative group trial, we hypothesized that standardized uptake value (SUV) on post-treatment [(18)F]fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) correlates with survival in stage III non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Patients received conventional concurrent platinum-based chemoradiotherapy without surgery; postradiotherapy consolidation chemotherapy was allowed. Post-treatment FDG-PET was performed at approximately 14 weeks after radiotherapy. SUVs were analyzed both as peak SUV (SUVpeak) and maximum SUV (SUVmax; both institutional and central review readings), with institutional SUVpeak as the primary end point. Relationships between the continuous and categorical (cutoff) SUVs and survival were analyzed using Cox proportional hazards multivariate models. Of 250 enrolled patients (226 were evaluable for pretreatment SUV), 173 patients were evaluable for post-treatment SUV analyses. The 2-year survival rate for the entire population was 42.5%. Pretreatment SUVpeak and SUVmax (mean, 10.3 and 13.1, respectively) were not associated with survival. Mean post-treatment SUVpeak and SUVmax were 3.2 and 4.0, respectively. Post-treatment SUVpeak was associated with survival in a continuous variable model (hazard ratio, 1.087; 95% CI, 1.014 to 1.166; P = .020). When analyzed as a prespecified binary value (<= v > 3.5), there was no association with survival. However, in exploratory analyses, significant results for survival were found using an SUVpeak cutoff of 5.0 (P = .041) or 7.0 (P < .001). All results were similar when SUVmax was used in univariate and multivariate models in place of SUVpeak. Higher post-treatment tumor SUV (SUVpeak or SUVmax) is associated with worse survival in stage III NSCLC, although a clear cutoff value for routine clinical use as a prognostic factor is uncertain at this time.",Excluded
1614,"Effect of proton-pump inhibitors on the risk of lower gastrointestinal bleeding associated with NSAIDs, aspirin, clopidogrel, and warfarin BACKGROUND: We investigated the effects of proton-pump inhibitors (PPIs) on lower gastrointestinal bleeding (LGIB) and of their interactions with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), low-dose aspirin, clopidogrel, and warfarin on LGIB risk., METHODS: We prospectively studied 355 patients emergently hospitalized for LGIB and 8,221 nonbleeding patients. All patients underwent colonoscopy. Smoking, alcohol drinking, drug exposure, and the Charlson comorbidity index score were assessed before colonoscopy. Adjusted odds ratios (AOR) of LGIB were estimated., RESULTS: LGIB was significantly associated with older age, higher comorbidity index, and NSAID, aspirin, clopidogrel, or warfarin use. PPI use was significantly associated with older age, male sex, being a current alcohol drinker, higher comorbidity index, and NSAID, aspirin, clopidogrel, warfarin, acetaminophen, or corticosteroid use. Multivariate analysis adjusted by the confounding factors revealed LGIB was not significantly associated with PPI use (AOR 0.87; 95 % confidence interval 0.68-1.13; p = 0.311), or specifically with omeprazole (AOR 1.18; p = 0.408), esomeprazole (AOR 0.76; p = 0.432), lansoprazole (AOR 0.93; p = 0.669), or rabeprazole (AOR 0.63; p = 0.140). In the interaction model, no significant interactions were observed between PPIs and NSAIDs (AOR 1.40; p = 0.293), aspirin (AOR 1.09; p = 0.767), clopidogrel (AOR 0.99, p = 0.985), or warfarin (AOR 1.52; p = 0.398)., CONCLUSIONS: This large case-control study demonstrated that PPI use did not lead to an increased risk of LGIB, regardless of the type of PPI used. Further, LGIB risk was not affected by PPI use, irrespective of concomitant therapy with NSAIDs, low-dose aspirin, clopidogrel, or warfarin.",Excluded
2832,"Radiographic Union Scoring Scale for Determining Consolidation Rates in the Calcaneus The reliable evaluation of osseous consolidation after hindfoot osteotomy can be difficult. Concomitant hindfoot osteotomies often dictate the advancement of weightbearing, and radiographs are the mainstay imaging tool owing to cost, efficiency, and radiation exposure. Understanding the radiographic parameters that can be used to reliably determine osseous healing is paramount. However, currently, no reliable or validated method is available to determine osseous healing of hindfoot osteotomies in irregular bones of the foot. The purpose of the present study was to develop a radiographic healing scoring system that would enhance the diagnostic healing assessment after elective calcaneal osteotomy. We adapted existing orthopedic scales validated for healing in the leg for application in the irregular bones of the foot. A total of 168 cases were evaluated by 6 blinded assessors to test the interrater reliability of subjective healing assessment compared with the proposed scoring system. The radiographs were classified by postoperative period: <=4 weeks, 5 to 12 weeks, and >12 weeks. The proposed scale had high interrater reliability but was burdensome. Using a priori item reduction protocols, a limited 6-item scale further improved internal consistency and reduced the burden. The result was excellent interrater reliability (alpha = 0.98, standard deviation 0.02, 95% confidence interval 0.91 to 0.96) among all assessors when using the scoring scale compared with unacceptable reliability (alpha = 0.438) for subjective osteotomy healing. The reliability of our system appeared superior to that of subjective assessment of osseous healing alone, even in the absence of clinical correlates after osteotomy of the calcaneus.

2388,"Nimotuzumab provides survival benefit to patients with inoperable advanced squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck: A randomized, open-label, phase IIb, 5-year study in Indian patients Objective Overexpression of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) in many cancers makes it an attractive therapeutic target. This study evaluated the clinical utility of nimotuzumab, a monoclonal anti-EGFR antibody, used concurrently with radiotherapy (RT) and chemoradiotherapy (CRT) in squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck (SCCHN). Methods This open-label study randomized 92 treatment-naive patients (1:1) with advanced SCCHN into chemoradiation (CRT +/- nimotuzumab) or radiation (RT +/- nimotuzumab) group by investigator's discretion; these were further randomized into CRT + nimotuzumab or CRT and RT + nimotuzumab or RT groups, respectively. Treatment included 6 cycles each of cisplatin (50 mg/week), nimotuzumab (200 mg/week), and RT (total dose, 60-66 Gy). Response (tumor size reduction) was assessed at Month 6 post-treatment and survival, at Month 60. Results Forty and 36 patients in the chemoradiation and radiation groups, respectively (intent-to-treat population) were evaluated. Overall response at Month 6 post-treatment was 100% with CRT + nimotuzumab, 70% with CRT, 76% with RT + nimotuzumab, and 37% with RT. At Month 60, overall survival was 57% with CRT + nimotuzumab, 26% with CRT (P = 0.03), 39% with RT + nimotuzumab, and 26% with RT (P > 0.05). Median overall survival was not reached for CRT + nimotuzumab; it was 21.94 months for CRT (P = 0.0078), 14.36 months for RT + nimotuzumab, and 12.78 months for RT (P = 0.45). Risk of death was 64% lower with CRT + nimotuzumab than with CRT (95%CI: 0.37, 1.56), and 24% lower with RT + nimotuzumab than with RT (95%CI: 0.16, 0.79). Thus nimotuzumab was safe and well tolerated with few mild to moderate self-limiting adverse events.

2532,"In the evaluation of patients with skull base osteomyelitis, does 18F-FDG PET CT have a role? PURPOSE: To evaluate the diagnostic performance of regional fluorine-18 fluorodeoxyglucose (F-FDG) positron emission tomography-computed tomography (PET-CT) in patients with skull base osteomyelitis (SBO) and to compare with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) whenever available., MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 77 patients (male:female = 56:21; mean age 66.4 +/- 9.4 years) with clinically suspected SBO, who underwent regional F-FDG PET-CT were included in this retrospective study. F-FDG PET-CT images were analyzed for presence, localization and intensity of FDG uptake. Diagnostic performance of F-FDG PET-CT was analyzed based on histopathology, culture, and clinical/imaging follow-up. The agreement analysis between F-FDG PET-CT and MRI findings was performed in 56 patients., RESULTS: The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value, and accuracy of F-FDG PET-CT for diagnosing SBO were 96.7, 93.3, 98.3, 87.5, and 96.1%, respectively. The average SUVmax of the lesions was 5.9 +/- 3.5. The SUVmax of the fungal lesions was lower than that of bacterial lesions with P-value of <0.001. On comparing variables like C-reactive protein, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, and SUVmax for prediction of recurrence/progression, by plotting an ROC curve, the SUVmax was found to be an independent prognostic marker. 56 out of 77 patients had undergone both F-FDG PET-CT and MRI. The agreement analysis between the modalities showed almost perfect agreement for delineation of soft tissue and bony involvement with kappa values of 0.82 and 0.81, respectively., CONCLUSION: F-FDG PET-CT is a sensitive tool in evaluation of patients with SBO. It shows a very good agreement with the MRI. It plays a critical role in treatment response evaluation.",Excluded
252,"Removal of comfort pads underneath babies: a method of reducing radiation exposure to neonates RATIONALE AND OBJECTIVES: The recent increasing utilization of imaging has increased the population exposure to ionizing radiation. With increasing knowledge of the potential harm of radiation exposure, efforts should be made to minimize patient radiation whenever possible, especially in young children. The purpose of this study was to use the exposure index (EI) standard to assess the potential for reducing radiation dose to babies by removing a soft comfort pad, often placed underneath the baby. The pad is located between the baby and the image detector plate. As such it absorbs x-rays that have already passed through the baby but have not yet reached the imaging detector plate. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Using a thoracic infant phantom and fixed exposure factors, we measured the percentage of the radiation exiting a neonatal chest phantom that was absorbed/attenuated by the comfort pad, before it hit the detector to create the image. We studied comfort pads of 4 different thicknesses, ranging from 0.5 to 8. RESULTS: Radiation beam attenuation, ranging from 12% to 72.1%, was found with all comfort pads, with increased x-ray beam attenuation occurring with increasing pad thickness. CONCLUSIONS: The study shows that comfort pads cause a high attenuation of the radiation beam, after it exits the chest phantom. As such, removal of the pads prior to radiographic exposure of babies is a method of potentially reducing patient radiation exposure in the newborn nursery.",Excluded

Complementary imaging techniques can be used to better characterize and quantify pathological changes associated with AMD. By assessing specific light-tissue interactions, polarization-sensitive imaging can be used to detect tissue disruption early in the disease process., PURPOSE: The aim of this study was to compare variability in central macular polarization properties in patients with nonexudative AMD and age-matched control subjects., METHODS: A scanning laser polarimeter (GDx, LDT/CZM) was used to acquire 15 x 15-degree macular images in 10 subjects diagnosed with nonexudative AMD and 10 age-matched control subjects. The coefficient of variation (COV, SD/mean) was used to quantify variability in pixel intensity in the central 3.3degree of the macula for custom images emphasizing multiply scattered light (the depolarized light image) and polarization-retaining light (the maximum of the parallel detector image). The intensity COV was compared across subject categories using paired t tests for each image type., RESULTS: The COV in the central macula was significantly higher in the AMD subject group (average, 0.221; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.157 to 0.265) when compared with matched control subjects (average 0.120; 95% CI, 0.107 to 0.133) in the depolarized light image (P = .01). The COV in the maximum of the parallel detector image was not statistically different between the two subject groups (AMD average, 0.162 [95% CI, 0.138 to 0.185]; control average, 0.137 [95% CI, 0.115 to 0.158]; P = .21)., CONCLUSIONS: Variability in multiply scattered light is higher than that of light that is more polarization preserving in patients with nonexudative AMD.

3042,"Correlation of factors affecting correction of meniscal extrusion and outcome after medial meniscus root repair Introduction: Meniscus extrusion in medial meniscus posterior root tears (MMPRT) is a consistent MRI finding and correction of extrusion is a primary objective of the meniscal root repair. The purpose of the study is to evaluate feasibility of correction of extrusion and correlation of various factors affecting the postoperative extrusion correction and outcomes in all degenerative medial meniscus posterior roots (MMPRTs). Method(s): A retrospective study of patients who presented with degenerative MMPRTs following trivial incident (Jun 2014 and Aug 2018) and included isolated Laprade type 2 root tear with extrusion in MRI. Patients with ligament injuries, tricompartmental arthritis, malalignment (> 50) and irreparable meniscal tears excluded. All patients underwent arthroscopic trans-tibial tunnel suture pull-out repair. A screening MRI was taken at a 6-month follow-up and functional scores (IKDC and Lysholm's) at final follow-up. The effects of age, gender, duration of symptoms, hip-knee-ankle angle on weight-bearing X-rays, ICRS grading of cartilage status, and MRI data (extrusion distance, tunnel location and healing status of meniscus) on outcomes were analysed. Result(s): MMPRT (n = 54) with a mean follow-up of 34.6 months (24-48). Mean functional outcomes improved postoperatively IKDC (43.40 +/- 5.16-78.65 +/- 5.11, p < 0.001) and Lysholm's (65.27 +/- 4.28-83.16 +/- 4.83, p < 0.001) scores at final follow-up. 57.4% (31) had good correction of extrusion, 3.7% (2) no correction and 38.8% (21) showed increase in extrusion postoperatively. Of all the factors we explored, age, ICRS (low grade) and knee varus (less 2.5 degree) affected extrusion correction. Patients with healed (41 patients), partially healed (9 patients) and anatomic tunnel placement (46 patients) had better extrusion correction than those with non-healing (4 patients) and non-anatomical tunnel (8 patients). Conclusion(s): Patients younger than 50 years, with low grade cartilage damage (ICRS 1, 2), lower KL grade and varus alignment (< 2.50) had good correction of extrusion. Correction of extrusion/progression of extrusion did not influence the clinical outcome at the short-term. The progression of meniscal extrusion is inevitable even after successful repair in elderly and high-risk patients.

METHOD(S): Seventy-nine consecutive patients who had undergone surgical resection for stomach cancer were enrolled. To monitor recurrence, SDCT (120 kilovolt peak [kVp], 200mAs) had been performed. The LDCT (120 kVp, 100 mA s) was taken, and images were reconstructed with 4 levels of adaptive statistical iterative reconstruction (ASIR) blending (0%, 30%, 50%, and 70%). Two blinded radiologists recorded the diagnostic confidence scores for local recurrence in each data set using a 5-point scale. Endoscopic biopsy results served as the reference standard. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis was used to calculate the diagnostic performance. RESULT(S): The diagnostic performance of LDCT with variable ASIR blending ratios was comparable to that of SDCT (area under ROC curve, 0.727-0.734, 0.687, respectively, P > 0.05).

3468,"Intracoronary beta-brachytherapy using a rhenium-188 filled balloon catheter in restenotic lesions of native coronary arteries and venous bypass grafts Purpose: We have previously demonstrated the efficacy of intracoronary beta-brachytherapy using a liquid 188Re-filled balloon in a randomised trial including de novo lesions. Percutaneous coronary interventions in restenotic lesions and in stenoses of venous bypass grafts are characterised by a high recurrence rate for restenosis and re-interventions. Against this background, we wanted to assess the impact of intracoronary beta-brachytherapy using a liquid 188Re-filled balloon in restenotic lesions in native coronary arteries and venous bypass grafts. Method(s): In 243 patients, beta-brachytherapy with 22.5 Gy was applied at a tissue depth of 0.5 mm. Patients were followed up angiographically after 6 months and clinically for 12 months. The primary clinical endpoint was the incidence of MACE (death, myocardial infarction, target vessel revascularisation). Secondary angiographic endpoints were late loss and binary restenosis rate in the total segment. Result(s): All irradiation procedures were successfully performed. A total of 222 lesions were in native coronary arteries; 21 were bypass lesions. Mean irradiation length was 41.6+/-17.3 mm (range 20-150 mm) in native coronary arteries and 48.1+/-33.9 mm (range 30-180 mm) in bypass lesions; the reference diameter was 2.57+/-0.52 mm and 2.83+/-0.76 mm, respectively. There was no vessel thrombosis during antiplatelet therapy. Angiographic/clinical follow-up rate was 84%/100%. MACE rate was 17.6% in the native coronary artery group and 38.1% in the CABG group (p<0.03). Binary restenosis rate was 22.5% and 55.6% (p<0.01), and late loss was 0.38+/-0.72 mm and 1.33+/-1.11 mm (p<0.001), respectively. Conclusion(s): We conclude that intracoronary beta-brachytherapy with a liquid 188Re-filled balloon using 22.5 Gy at a tissue depth of 0.5 mm in restenotic lesions is safe. It is associated with a low binary restenosis rate, resulting in a low occurrence rate of MACE within 12 months in restenotic lesions in native coronary arteries but not in vein grafts. © 2006 Springer-Verlag.",Excluded

Method(s): 40 patients with known malignancy underwent staging CT examinations at two time points. Both CT scans were performed on the same scanner (SOMATOM Definition Flash, Siemens Healthcare, Forchheim, Germany). For the baseline scan, the tube current-time product was set to 250mAs [image reconstruction: filtered back projection (FBP)] and for the follow-up scan to 150mAs [reconstruction: iterative reconstruction (IR)]. Effective radiation doses were estimated based on dose-length products for both baseline and follow-up. Noise measurements in defined regions were compared for FBP and IR. Images were also subjectively evaluated for image quality by three radiologists with different levels of experience. Result(s): Dose reduction was 44.4+/-8.2% for reduced-dose CT scans with IR compared with baseline with FBP. Image noise was not significantly different between images reconstructed with FBP and IR. The subjective quality of standard-dose FBP images and reduced-dose iteratively reconstructed CT images were identical.

1657,"Do radiation-induced bystander effects correlate to the intrinsic radiosensitivity of individuals and have clinical significance? It is well known that patients can vary in their normal tissue response to radiotherapy, and this can be problematic. As a result, radiobiologists have been using in vitro models to assess variation in response and elucidate the genetic determinants of this variation. However, the clinical relevance of these models is currently unknown. In this study, blood samples from healthy controls (n 20) and colorectal carcinoma patients (n 60) were cultured in vitro to assess two radiobiological end points in parallel: intrinsic radiosensitivity assayed by chromosomal aberrations (G2 scores) and radiation-induced bystander effects assayed by viability testing. Increased intrinsic radiosensitivity was observed in colorectal carcinoma donors (55) compared to the healthy donors (5) (P < 0.005). Similarly, more pronounced radiation-induced bystander effects were observed in the colorectal carcinoma donors compared to the healthy donors after 24 h exposure but not after 96 h exposure to donor irradiated cell conditioned medium (ICCM) (P < 0.05). All scores were tested for correlation with the age, sex and clinical stage of the colorectal carcinoma patients. The only statistically significant correlation was found in samples from severe Dukes D patients (P < 0.005), which had low/radioresistant G2 scores. No correlation was found between radiation-induced intrinsic sensitivity and bystander effects, which suggests that they may have separate underlying molecular mechanisms, but they both show clinical relevance in individual patient samples. © 2009 The Radiation Research Society.",Included
2091,"When should the doctor order a spine X-ray? Identifying vertebral fractures for osteoporosis care: results from the European Prospective Osteoporosis Study (EPOS) UNLABELLED: Vertebral fractures are common but usually remain unrecognized in primary care. Data from 2908 women and 2653 men in the EPOS study were used to derive algorithms to indicate the need for a spine X-ray to identify a fracture using easily elicited determinants. At a sensitivity of 50% for identifying cases, the specificity was increased from 50% to 78% in women and from 50% to 72% in men compared with a random allocation of X-rays. Use of X-rays can be optimized by selecting patients at high risk using a short screening procedure., INTRODUCTION: Previous osteoporotic fracture is an independent risk factor for further fractures and an indication for treatment. Vertebral fractures are the most common osteoporotic fractures before age 75, accounting for 48% of all fractures in men and 39% in women over 50. They usually remain unrecognized, so many patients requiring treatment are denied it, doubling their risk of a further fracture. Our objective was to develop an efficient algorithm indicating the need for an X-ray., MATERIALS AND METHODS: Data from 2908 women and 2653 men >or=50 years of age in the European Prospective Osteoporosis Study (EPOS) were analyzed. Lateral thoracic and lumbar spine radiographs were taken at baseline and at an average of 3.8 years later. Prevalent fractures were qualitatively diagnosed by an experienced radiologist. Fracture risk was modeled as a function of age, statural height loss since age 25, gender, and fracture history including limb fractures in the last 3 years using negative binomial regression. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were used to summarize a model's predictive ability, and a prediction algorithm was devised to identify those most likely to have a fracture., RESULTS: In a multivariate model for women, the risk of prevalent vertebral fracture significantly increased with age (RR, 1.67 [95% CI, 1.46, 1.93] per decade), statural height loss (1.06, [1.03, 1.10] per centimeter decrease), self-reported history of spine fracture (7.52 [5.52, 10.23]), and history of other major fracture (1.83 [1.46, 2.28]). Higher body weight reduced risk (0.86 [0.79, 0.95] per 10-kg increase). In men, the respective RR estimates were as follows: age (1.32 [1.18, 1.49]); height loss (1.06 [1.04, 1.09]); self-reported spine fracture (5.05 [3.69, 6.90]); other major fracture (1.42 [1.12, 1.81]); and weight (0.86 [0.79, 0.94]). Using algorithms based on these easily elicited determinants, specificity was increased from 50% to 78% in women and from 50% to 72% in men at a sensitivity of 50% compared with a random allocation of X-rays. At a sensitivity of 75%, the specificity was 50% in women and 40% in men. Inclusion of hip BMD (femoral neck or trochanter), measured in 1360 women and 1046 men, significantly improved the area under the ROC curves by 4% in women (p < 0.002) but not in men (p > 0.350). Spine BMD, measured in 982 women and 847 men, produced a significant 5% AUC improvement in women (p = 0.007) but not in men (p = 0.554)., CONCLUSION: A woman 65 years of age with one vertebral fracture has a one in four chance of another fracture over 5 years, which can be reduced to one in eight by treatment. Positive treatment decisions are often contingent on identifying a vertebral fracture. Selective use of lateral vertebral X-rays can be optimized using a 2-minute screening procedure administered by a nurse.",Excluded
600,"Selective arterial embolisation for the treatment of mobile spine aneurismal bone cyst: Prospective study Introduzione: Aneurismal Bone Cyst (ABC) is a benign cystic lesion of the bone made of blood containing gaps separated by connective tissue. In 10-30 % of cases ABC is localized at spine level. Different treatment options are possible: 1) curettage and bone grafting; 2) en bloc excision; 3) selective arterial embolization (SAE); 4) radiotherapy; 5) combination of these procedures. The aim of this study is to evaluate prospectively the results obtained using SAE only for the treatment of ABC. Materiali e metodi: 20 patients (9 female, 11 male), mean age 24 years (range: 12-39 years), mean follow up 40 months (range: 9.4- 49.4 months) affected by Aneurismal Bone Cyst of the mobile spine without instability were analyzed. Patients underwent the same diagnostic protocol (X-ray, CT scan, MRI) and the same treatment (selective arterial embolization). The same evaluation protocol was used for all patients (X-ray, CT scan at 8 weeks following embolization). Risultati: From one to seven SAE were performed depending on cases. The mean length of hospital stay was 2.2 days for each embolization treatment (range 2-5 days). 18 patients on 20 were treated using SAE only. In 1 case, presenting progressive paraplegia due to T8 ABC, surgical decompression and T6-T10 fixation were needed. (Frankel E after surgery). After 3 months F.U. local recurrence was observed and it is being treated using SAE. In 1 case, presenting C7 ABC, an Halo Vest was necessary for 30 days, being substituted by a Minerva plaster for three months. 19 patient on 20 are classified as NED (no evidence of disease) at the last F.U. 1 patient as AWD (alive with disease). Discussione e conclusioni: ABC is a benign lesion but in some cases can be locally aggressive causing pain, loss of function, spinal cord, nerve roots or cauda equina compression and pathological fractures. Selective arterial embolization (SAE) was used first as adjuvant procedure to reduce bleeding during surgery. First, De Rosa in 1990 treated ABC using embolization only. Nowadays SAE represents an effective, safe and minimally invasive approach for the treatment of ABC. It could be considered the gold standard treatment for ABC without instability or neurological complications. In the case of failure or poor results surgical treatment must be considered.",Excluded
1626,"Robustness of IMPT treatment plans with respect to inter-fractional set-up uncertainties: Impact of various beam arrangements for cranial targets In the current study IMPT plan robustness was evaluated with respect to inter-fractional patient positioning for various beam arrangements and two tumor indications in the cranial region. Material and methods. For 14 patients suffering from tumors in the cranial region [skull base (SB; n = 7) and paranasal sinus (PS; n = 7)] the CTV and OARs were delineated. A safety margin of 3 mm was applied to the CTV. A prescribed dose of 2 GyE was planned via three beam arrangements (alpha, beta, gamma). Beam arrangement alpha consisted of lateral opposed fields for both tumor groups while beam arrangement beta was optimized according to respective tumor and OAR locations, using two beams only. Beam arrangement gamma applied four beams in the SB group and three beams in the PS group. Dose distributions were recalculated subjected to virtual patient translations along the major anatomical axes. The following dosimetric indices were evaluated and compared to original plans: target coverage (TC), target dose homogeneity (HI), CTV median and average dose (Dmedian, Dmean). For OARs near maximum dose and average dose (D2%, Dmean) were evaluated. Results. Dose distributions were distorted after introducing shifts. In the SB group, TC and HI were significantly different for caudal, cranial and anterior shifts for all beam arrangements. For PS patients, all but right shifts differed significantly from the original plans for all beam arrangements, although clinical relevance was not reached for arrangement gamma (DELTATC < 1.5%). In general, beam arrangement gamma exhibited the least spread of data regarding target indices and was consequently considered the most robust. Dosimetric parameters regarding the brainstem were mostly influenced by shifts along the anterio-posterior axis. Conclusion. For cranial IMPT, set-up uncertainties may lead to pronounced deterioration of dose distributions.

Complications related to G-tubes (and G-buttons) in children represent a common presentation to the emergency department (ED). G-tube replacement is usually performed by pediatric emergency medicine physicians. Misplacement may lead to tract disruption, perforation, fistula tract formation, or feeding into the peritoneum. Contrast-enhanced radiographs are traditionally used for confirmation. In addition to a longer length-of-stay, repeat ED visits result in repeated radiation exposure. The use of point-of-care ultrasound (POCUS) instead of radiography avoids this exposure to ionizing radiation. Here, we describe three patients who presented with G-tube complications in whom POCUS alone performed by pediatricians was used for confirmation of the tubes' replacement. Two children presented to the ED with G-tube dislodgement, and one child presented with a ruptured balloon. In all three cases, a new G-tube was replaced at the bedside using POCUS guidance without the need for further radiographic studies. There were no known ED or clinic returns for G-tube complaints over the next 30 days. This is the first report of pediatricians using POCUS to guide and confirm G-tube replacement in children. The success of these cases suggests the technique's feasibility. Future prospective studies are needed to evaluate the learning curves, diagnostic accuracy, ED length-of-stay, and use of confirmatory imaging.",Excluded
3273,"Cardiac valve calcifications on low-dose unenhanced ungated chest computed tomography: Inter-observer and inter-examination reliability, agreement and variability Objectives: To determine inter-observer and inter-examination variability for aortic valve calcification (AVC) and mitral valve and annulus calcification (MC) in low-dose unenhanced ungated lung cancer screening chest computed tomography (CT). Method(s): We included 578 lung cancer screening trial participants who were examined by CT twice within 3 months to follow indeterminate pulmonary nodules. On these CTs, AVC and MC were measured in cubic millimetres. One hundred CTs were examined by five observers to determine the inter-observer variability. Reliability was assessed by kappa statistics (kappa) and intra-class correlation coefficients (ICCs). Variability was expressed as the mean difference +/- standard deviation (SD). Result(s): Inter-examination reliability was excellent for AVC (kappa=0.94, ICC=0.96) and MC (kappa=0.95, ICC=0.90). Inter-examination variability was 12.7+/-118.2 mm3 for AVC and 31.5+/-219.2 mm3 for MC. Inter-observer reliability ranged from kappa=0.68 to kappa=0.92 for AVC and from kappa=0.20 to kappa=0.66 for MC. Inter-observer ICC was 0.94 for AVC and ranged from 0.56 to 0.97 for MC. Inter-observer variability ranged from -30.5+/-252.0 mm3 to 84.0+/-240.5 mm3 for AVC and from -95.2+/-210.0 mm3 to 303.7+/-501.6 mm 3 for MC. Conclusion(s): AVC can be quantified with excellent reliability on ungated unenhanced low-dose chest CT, but manual detection of MC can be subject to substantial inter-observer variability. Lung cancer screening CT may be used for detection and quantification of cardiac valve calcifications. Key points: * Low-dose unenhanced ungated chest computed tomography can detect cardiac valve calcifications. * However, calcified cardiac valves are not reported by most radiologists. * Inter-observer and inter-examination variability of aortic valve calcifications is sufficient for longitudinal studies. * Volumetric measurement variability of mitral valve and annulus calcifications is substantial. © 2014 European Society of Radiology.",Excluded
234,"Comparison of 51chromium-labeled ethylenediamine tetra-acetic acid and iohexol as blood markers for intestinal permeability testing in Beagle dogs (51)Chromium-labeled ethylenediamine tetra-acetic acid ((51)Cr-EDTA) is the gold standard probe for assessing intestinal permeability (IP) in dogs, but exposure to radioactivity is a disadvantage. Iohexol is a safe contrast medium commonly used for medical imaging purposes and has been successfully applied more recently for the assessment of IP in animal models and humans. This study aimed at comparing (51)Cr-EDTA and iohexol as IP blood markers in dogs. A test solution containing (51)Cr-EDTA and iohexol was administered intragastrically to seven healthy laboratory Beagle dogs, and percentage recoveries in serum were calculated. The strong linear association (correlation, r=0.76 and linear regression, y=0.03+5.04x) between (51)Cr-EDTA and iohexol supports the potential usefulness of iohexol as an IP blood marker in dogs.

849,"Quantitative bone single-photon emission computed tomography for prediction of pain relief in metastatic bone disease treated with rhenium-186 etidronate PURPOSE: To calculate radiation doses of rhenium-186 ((186)Re) etidronate in painful bone metastases using quantitative bone single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) and to determine the threshold dose for predicting pain relief. We also wanted to determine whether technetium-99m ((99m)Tc) methylene diphosphonate (MDP) concentrations predict radiation doses of (186)Re etidronate in painful lesions., MATERIALS AND METHODS: Forty-eight patients with breast and prostate cancer were evaluated. Patients received therapeutic doses of (186)Re etidronate. The area under the pain over time curve (AUPC) was measured for 8 weeks after treatment. Response was calculated as the percentage of change in AUPC. Quantitative bone SPECT (QBS)-measured concentration of (186)Re etidronate was used for calculating radiation doses. Receiver operating characteristics curve analysis determined the radiation dose threshold that best separated responders from nonresponders. SPECT-measured concentration of (186)Re etidronate in the urinary bladder was correlated with its concentration in the voided urine. Concentration of (99m)Tc MDP was compared with radiation doses to painful metastases., RESULTS: The radiation dose threshold was 2.10 Gy. For a decrease of 50% in the AUPC, the positive predictive value (PPV) of this value was 75% and the negative predictive value (NPV) was 88%. For a decrease in pain of 33%, the PPV was 84% and the NPV was 81%. In prostate cancer patients only, the PPV was 81% and the NPV was 92%. The correlation between in vivo/in vitro measured urine concentration was 0.90. The correlation between (99m)Tc MDP concentration and radiation doses of (186)Re etidronate was 0.92., CONCLUSION: QBS-measured radiation doses of (186)Re etidronate in painful metastases are a good predictor of pain relief. Bone SPECT using (99m)Tc MDP predicts radiation doses delivered by (186)Re etidronate.",Excluded
2382,"IL-10 IS DOWN-REGULATED IN THE CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASES SUSPECTED PATIENTS, INDEPENDENT OF ANGIOGRAPHY IL-10 and interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) are the important anti and pro-inflammatory cytokines, respectively, which may participate in the cardiovascular disease pathogenesis. Additionally, environmental factors, such as the X-ray, can modulate cytokine expression. Due to the fact that X-ray is used during angiography, hence, angiography may alter expression of the cytokines., OBJECTIVE: Accordingly, this project was aimed to assess IL-10 and IFN-gamma serum levels within cardiovascular patients (with and without vessel stenosis) versus healthy controls and also the effects of angiography on the serum levels of the cytokines., MATERIAL AND METHODS: This study was performed on the 80 participants, including twenty cases in each group (healthy controls and cardiovascular patients without vessel stenosis, stenosis of 1 vessel and stenosis of more than 1 vessel) to evaluate IL-10 and IFN-gamma serum levels using ELISA technique. The IL-10 and IFN-gamma serum levels also compared within group 2, 3 and 4 before and after angiography to explore the effects of the technique on the IL-10 and IFN-gamma serum levels., RESULTS: IL-10, but not IFN-gamma, serum levels were higher in the healthy controls than all cardiovascular patients. IL-10 and IFN-gamma serum levels were not altered after angiography and also were not differ in the smoker versus non- smoker and opium consuming versus non-opium consuming participants., CONCLUSION: Due to the results it may be concluded that IL-10 can be considered as a plausible inhibitor of cardio- vascular diseases independent of angiography duration and X-ray, however, IFN-gamma has no effects in the Iranian patients suffering from cardiovascular diseases.

2001,"Differentiation of salivary gland tumors through tumor heterogeneity: a comparison between pleomorphic adenoma and Warthin tumor using CT texture analysis Purpose: We compared the diagnostic performance of CT texture analysis in single-phase CT scan with that of conventional enhancement pattern analysis in a two-phase CT scan for discrimination of salivary gland tumors, Warthin tumor (WT) from pleomorphic adenoma (PA). Method(s): One hundred seventy-eight patients with PA and 84 patients with WT were selected and CT texture analysis was separately performed on early (40s) and delayed (180s) phases, after injection of the contrast agent, using commercially available software. The attenuation changes and enhancement patterns were visually and quantitatively assessed with Hounsfield units (HU). Differences between PAs and WTs were analyzed using chi2 test and independent t test. Diagnostic performance of texture parameters in single-phase CT was compared with that of dynamic enhancement pattern in two-phase CT using the McNemar test. Result(s): Ratio of tumoral HU (delayed phase/early phase) was significantly higher in PAs compared with WTs (p < 0.001). Tumor heterogeneity parameters, standard deviation (SD) and entropy, were significantly lower in WTs regardless of the type of filter used (p <= 0.001). Mean with coarse filter (AUC = 0.944) on early phase scan and entropy with medium filter (AUC = 0.901) on delayed scan were best discriminators between PAs and WTs. Diagnostic accuracy of mean (90.5%) on early scan and entropy (84.7%) on delayed scan was not significantly different from the accuracy (89.3%) of conventional wash-out pattern for distinguishing WTs from PAs (p = 0.742, p = 0.088, respectively). Conclusion(s): Diagnostic performance of texture parameters was similar to that of quantitative enhancement pattern for differentiating WTs from PAs, with the advantage in lower radiation exposure.Copyright © 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.",Excluded

The linear energy transfers (LET infinity s) for the radiations were 90 +/- 5, 35 +/- 3, and 0.3 keV/micrometer, respectively. After irradiation, lenticular opacities were monitored through their incipient and/or clinical stages (less than or equal to 5 years) by slit-lamp biomicroscopy and scored with subjective, but well-defined, indices. Cataractogenesis, which progressed according to the model proposed by Rubin and Casarett (1968), was modified by radiation quality in the following ways. (1) The rate of development of the early (acute) stage increased with the LET infinity of the incident radiation; (2) at the intermediate (plateau) stage, the values for the relative biological effectiveness (r.b.e.) of the heavy ions were similar to those reported for proliferating cells in culture; (3) for a given intermediate level, the onset of late cataractogenesis occurred earlier the higher the LET affinity of the radiation involved.

3636,"Irradiation of male mammary gland for the prevention of hormone induced gynecomastia Treatment of carcinoma of the prostate with female sex hormones causes not only impotence but also swollen, painfully mammary glands. The radiobiological response of the mammary glands renders it possible to prevent hormone induced gynecomastia by means of radiotherapy. On this indication, 121 patients treated with female sex hormones between 1961 and 1972 for carcinoma of the prostate were subjected to irradiation of both mammary glands. On 4 successive days, daily doses of 300 r surface dose were administered to each mammary gland, corresponding to a focal dose of 840 r at 3 cm tissue depth. The parameters were: roentgen radiation, 150 kV, 20 mA, 0.5 mm Cu, focus skin distance 40 cm, field size 6 x 6 m. 84 patients could be followed up more than 6 mth after the treatment. In 67 cases (79.8%), development of gynecomastia was completely suppressed, while in 16 cases, a slight degree of gynecomastia had occurred in spite of the irradiation. In one case, the gynecomastia that had already been completely developed at the time of the radiotherapy, had remained uninfluenced apart from a mitigation of the sensation of tension. In 6 of the patients who were free from gynecomastia (8.9%) the hormone treatment had been started prior to the radiotherapy. This proportion was considerably larger among the patients with mild gynecomastia, viz. 75% (12 cases). The lesser effect of the radiotherapy is considered to be correlated with the duration and dosage of the hormone treatment started prior to the radiotherapy, and may also be correlated with the duration of the interval between the end of the hormone treatment and the start of the irradiation.",Excluded

Methods and Materials: Radiotherapy was delivered to a total of 45 Gy in 25 fractions and followed by a coned-down boost of 5.4 Gy in 3 fractions. Concurrent chemotherapy consisted of a fixed dose of oxaliplatin (50 mg/m2/week) on Days 1, 8, 22, and 29 and escalated doses of S-1 on Days 1-14 and 22-35. The initial dose of S-1 was 50 mg/m2/day, gradually increasing to 60, 70, and 80 mg/m2/day. Surgery was performed within 6 +/- 2 weeks. Result(s): Twelve patients were enrolled and tolerated up to Dose Level 4 (3 patients at each dose level) without dose-limiting toxicity. An additional 3 patients were enrolled at Dose Level 4, with 1 experiencing a dose-limiting toxicity of Grade 3 diarrhea. Although maximum tolerated dose was not attained, Dose Level 4 (S-1 80 mg/m 2/day) was chosen as the recommended dose for further Phase II studies. No Grade 4 toxicity was observed, and Grade 3 toxicities of leukopenia and diarrhea occurred in the same patient (1 of 15, 6.7%). Pathologic complete responses were observed in 2 of 15 patients (13.3%).

Ten mice were assigned to a normal control group (no intervention) and the other 5 groups were subjected to a forced running regimen to induce osteoarthritis. One group was set as the model control group. The other 4 groups were given 90 s of a 650 nm laser, 90 s of a 10.6 mum laser, 90 s of a combined laser, or a sham treatment on acupoint Dubi (ST35) of the rear left leg 3 times per week for 4 weeks. The modified Mankin score was used to evaluate the degree of cartilage degradation. Immunohistochemical staining for heat shock protein (HSP) 70 was conducted., RESULTS: Mankin scores of the model control group and the sham control group were significantly higher than that of the normal control group (P<0.01). Mankin score of the combined laser group was significantly lower than that of the model control group (P<0.01). Compared with the normal control group, there was a significant induction of HSP70 in the arthritic chondrocytes of the combined laser group., CONCLUSION: The arthritic cartilage induced in C57 black mice improved significantly after combined laser treatment of 650 nm and 10.6 mum lasers. This effect may be related to the induction of HSP70 in the arthritic chondrocytes. The two different lasers appear to have a synergistic effect.",Excluded

3594,"Radiation-dose response of glycophorin A somatic mutation in erythrocytes associated with gene polymorphisms of p53 binding protein 1 Information on individual variations in response to ionizing radiation is still quite limited. Previous studies of atomic-bomb survivors revealed that somatic mutations at the glycophorin A (GPA) gene locus in erythrocytes were significantly elevated with radiation exposure dose, and that the dose response was significantly higher in survivors with subsequent cancer development compared to those without cancer development. Noteworthy in these studies were great inter-individual differences in GPA mutant fraction even in persons with similar radiation doses. It is hypothesized that persistent GPA mutations in erythrocytes of atomic-bomb survivors are derived from those in long-lived hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) populations, and that individual genetic backgrounds, specifically related to DNA double-strand break repair, contribute to individual differences in HSC mutability following radiation exposure. Thus, we examined the relationship between radiation exposure, GPA mutant fraction in erythrocytes, and single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of the key gene involved in DNA double-strand break repair, p53 binding protein 1 (53BP1). 53BP1 SNPs and inferred haplotypes demonstrated a significant interaction with radiation dose, suggesting that radiation-dose response of GPA somatic mutation is partly dependent on 53BP1 genotype. It is also possible that 53BP1 plays a significant role in DNA double-strand break repair in HSCs following radiation exposure. Copyright © 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",Excluded
3264,"Image-guided stereotactic ablative radiotherapy for the liver: a safe and effective treatment AIMS: Stereotactic ablative body radiotherapy (SABR) is a non-invasive treatment option for inoperable patients or patients with irresectable liver tumors. Outcome and toxicity were evaluated retrospectively in this single-institution patient cohort., PATIENTS AND METHODS: Between 2010 and 2014, 39 lesions were irradiated in 33 consecutive patients (18 male, 15 female, median age of 68 years). All the lesions were liver metastases (n = 34) or primary hepatocellular carcinomas (n = 5). The patients had undergone four-dimensional respiration-correlated PET-CT for treatment simulation to capture tumor motion. We analyzed local control with a focus on CT-based response at three months, one year and two years after treatment, looking at overall survival and the progression pattern., RESULTS: All patients were treated with hypofractionated image-guided stereotactic radiotherapy. The equivalent dose in 2 Gy fractions varied from 62.5 Gy to 150 Gy, delivered in 3-10 fractions (median dose 93.8 Gy, alpha/beta = 10). The CT-based regression pattern three months after radiotherapy revealed partial regression in 72.7% of patients with a complete remission in 27.3% of the cases. The site of first progression was predominantly distant. One- and two-year overall survival rates were 85.4% and 68.8%, respectively. No toxicity of grade 2 or higher according to the NCI Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events v4.0 was observed., CONCLUSION: SABR is a safe and efficient treatment for selected inoperable patients or irresectable tumors of the liver. Future studies should combine SABR with systemic treatment acting in synergy with radiation, such as immunological interventions or hypoxic cell radiosensitizers to prevent distant relapse.

74,"The Impact of Dose Rate on DNA Double-Strand Break Formation and Repair in Human Lymphocytes Exposed to Fast Neutron Irradiation The lack of information on how biological systems respond to low-dose and low dose-rate exposures makes it difficult to accurately assess the carcinogenic risks. This is of critical importance to space radiation, which remains a serious concern for long-term manned space exploration. In this study, the gamma-H2AX foci assay was used to follow DNA double-strand break (DSB) induction and repair following exposure to neutron irradiation, which is produced as secondary radiation in the space environment. Human lymphocytes were exposed to high dose-rate (HDR: 0.400 Gy/min) and low dose-rate (LDR: 0.015 Gy/min) p(66)/Be(40) neutrons. DNA DSB induction was investigated 30 min post exposure to neutron doses ranging from 0.125 to 2 Gy. Repair kinetics was studied at different time points after a 1 Gy neutron dose. Our results indicated that gamma-H2AX foci formation was 40% higher at HDR exposure compared to LDR exposure. The maximum gamma-H2AX foci levels decreased gradually to 1.65 +/- 0.64 foci/cell (LDR) and 1.29 +/- 0.45 (HDR) at 24 h postirradiation, remaining significantly higher than background levels. This illustrates a significant effect of dose rate on neutron-induced DNA damage. While no significant difference was observed in residual DNA damage after 24 h, the DSB repair half-life of LDR exposure was slower than that of HDR exposure. The results give a first indication that the dose rate should be taken into account for cancer risk estimations related to neutrons.",Included

For the last few years, the interest in such devices has grown rapidly, allowing multiplication of the solar conversion efficiency by 5 within about 10 years. The highest conversion efficiency obtained is now close to 5% with a spin-coated polythiophene-fullerene blend. For a better understanding of those polymer blend systems, we have fabricated a coevaporated solar cell from model molecules. The molecular blend was composed of sexithiophene (, -dihexylsexithiophene, T6) as a donor and fullerene C60 as an acceptor. The influence of the T6: C60 proportion was studied for an active layer of 100 nm thickness. The conversion efficiency obtained with the optimal proportion of T6: C60 (40-60) is 0.7%. Reverse bias annealing effect was studied by measuring the current-voltage characteristics after each postprocessing step. The conversion efficiency reached 1% but still remained much less than for the polymer bulk heterojunction.

2724,"Reconstitution of bone marrow with WKy cells lowers central/peripheral inflammation and blood pressure in the SHR Introduction: Bone marrow (BM) is a crucial meeting point for the sympathetic innervation and hematopoietic/stem cells, including the inflammatory cells (ICs). However, the role of the BM in hypertension is not well defined. We recently demonstrated that a dysfunctional brain-bone marrow communication in rat models of neurogenic hypertension may be associated with impaired BM activity, characterized by elevated levels of ICs in the blood and BM when compared to the normotensive controls. Therefore, we hypothesized that BM of the spontaneously hypertensive rat (SHR) is pro-inflammatory, and that it contributes to hypertension in this rat model. Method(s): 6-week old female SHR rats underwent BM ablation via a lethal dose of gamma ray irradiation (950 Rads), followed by reconstitution with whole BM mononuclear cells (MNCs, 10E6 cells per rat), derived from the BM of either SHR or WKY male rats (naive SHR n=7; SHR-SHR n=11; SHR-WKY n=9). Following a three-month recovery period, BM reconstitution was confirMed. by Y-chromosome FISH in blood MNCs. Blood pressure was measured by tail-cuff plethysmography. Blood was collected for isolation of MNCs, and quantification of T-cells (CD4/CD8+) was carried out by flow cytometry. Brains were collected and immunohistochemistry was perforMed. using the microglial specific marker Iba1. Microglial activation was quantified by number of microglia per 40,000um2 in the paraventricular nucleus (PVN) of the hypothalamus. Result(s): We observed no significant difference in the mean arterial pressures (MAP) between the naive SHR (MAP= 134 +/- 5 mmHg) and the SHR-SHR groups (MAP = 137 +/- 5 mmHg). However, the SHR-WKY group showed an approximate 10% decrease in MAP, to 119 +/- 4 mmHg (p<0.05). This was accompanied by a 30% decrease in the circulating T-cell levels, and a 20% decrease in activated microglial cells in the PVN of the SHR-WKY when compared to the SHR-SHR group (p<0.05). Conclusion(s): These data suggest that the pro-inflammatory properties of the SHR BM contribute to hypertension by increasing both the peripheral and central inflammatory status in the SHR. These observations support the role of the BM in hypertension, especially in affecting the inflammatory status, which is a hallmark of hypertension in the SHR.",Excluded
2616,"Novel mutation in keratin 10 causing autosomal dominant epidermolytic ichthyosis Epidermolytic ichthyosis (EI; OMIM 113800), previously termed bullous congenital ichthyosiform erythroderma or epidermolytic hyperkeratosis, is a clinically heterogeneous disorder of keratinization caused by mutations in either of the KRT1 or KRT10 genes, which encode the suprabasal keratins K1 and K10, respectively. The condition is usually characterized clinically by severe neonatal erythroderma, blistering and fragile skin, with the subsequent development of generalized hyperkeratosis. Usually mutations are missense substitutions in the highly conserved alpha-helical rod domains of these keratins, which play a critical role in filament formation. The presence of palmoplantar keratoderma is suggestive of KRT1 mutations, whereas KRT10 mutations are associated with palmoplantar sparing. We report a seven-generation kindred with EI due to a novel mutation in KRT10. A 32-year-old woman presented with widespread ichthyosis and erythema affecting her trunk and limbs. She gave a history of scaling and erythroderma since birth but no blistering, erosions or collodion membrane. She had been maintained on oral isotretinoin 20-40 mg once daily from the age of 13 years, but had recently developed lower-back and hip pain. Examination revealed widespread fine scaling and erythema over the trunk and limbs with more significant hyperkeratosis at the elbows, knees and ankles. There was relative sparing of the palmoplantar skin. Her father, uncle and grandmother were more severely affected, but none was receiving oral retinoids. Four further generations were recorded as affected. Histology of affected elbow and upper-arm skin demonstrated acanthosis, marked overlying hyperkeratosis, vacuolar change of the upper epidermal cells in the upper epidermis with prominent clumping of keratohyaline granules and abnormal eosinophilic cytoplasm. X-rays of the lower lumbar spine and left hip demonstrated bridging osteophytes T11-L1 and flattening of the left femoral head, with magnetic resonance imaging confirming the presence of avascular necrosis. This required treatment with a left core decompression of the left hip, with good results. Mutation screening of KRT10 identified a novel heterozygous deletion extending from intron 5 into exon 6 (designated K10 c.1156-79- 1243del), abolishing the exon 6 acceptor splice site, resulting in a shorter aberrant K10 protein lacking a sequence motif critically important for keratin filament assembly. The mutation was present in her affected father. This finding adds to the evidence that K10 mutations are the principal cause of autosomal dominant EI with palmoplantar sparing. It also highlights the possible side-effects of long-term oral retinoid treatment in these inherited conditions.",Excluded
1371,"Influence of diabetes on the interpretation of PET scans in patients with esophageal cancer Purpose: Patients with diabetes mellitus (DM) can have altered sugar transport into cells, potentially affecting the results of 18-FDG PET scans. The specific aim of this study was to determine the effect of DM on pre- and post treatment standard uptake value (SUV) scores in patients undergoing chemo-radiotherapy for esophageal cancer. Method(s): Patients with locally advanced esophageal carcinoma undergoing preoperative or definitive chemoradiotherapy underwent pre-and post treatment 18-FDG PET scans. Maximum SUV score was measured from the tumor before chemoradiotherapy and 3 to 4 weeks after chemoradiotherapy (preoperatively). Patients were identified as having DM by medical record review. Random serum glucose measurements were obtained prior to 18-FDG PET scans. The Wilcoxon signed-rank test was used to test for differences in SUV scores between patients with and without DM, and a generalized linear model with backward selection was applied to search for significant predictors of initial and post treatment SUV scores. Result(s): Sixty-three patients underwent 18-FDG PET scans during the course of treatment for esophageal malignancies between 6/02 and 8/05. Fifty-four patients received chemotherapy. The median radiation dose was 46.8 Gy. Eighteen patients had DM, six were insulin-dependent DM (IDDM). There was no difference in initial SUV scores between DM and non-DM patients (P >.05). There was also no difference in initial SUV scores between IDDM and non-IDDM groups. Patients with tumors at the gastroesophageal junction had lower initial SUV scores compared to patients with tumors in the lower or midesophagus(P =.05). T stage was associated with initial SUV score (T2 lower than T3, P =.014). Older age (P =.03), diabetes (P =.007), higher T stage (P =.002), and presence of nodes (P =.05) were each positively associated with post treatment SUV scores. Blood glucose levels prior to 18-FDG PET scan, endoscopic tumor length, and tumor location were not predictive of post treatment SUV scores. Patients with DM had significantly lower post treatment SUV scores compared to patients without DM (P =.04). Pathologic complete response or percent SUV decrease did not differ between patients with or without DM. Conclusion(s): Regardless of glucose levels, DM and IDDM do not influence pretreatment SUV scores in patients with localized esophageal cancer. However, DM may influence post treatment SUV scores and thus complicate interpretation of treatment response. Further confirmatory study in a larger cohort of DM patients to evaluate the relationship of post treatment SUV score to pathologic response is warranted. © 2009 by International Society of Gastrointestinal Oncology.",Excluded
3639,"Serum Zinc Level in beta-Thalassemia Major: A Retrospective Study in Southwest Iran Thalassemia, which is associated with compound complications, is the most common hereditary anemia in the world. The zinc level is different in patients with thalassemias. This study aimed to determine the zinc status and its relationship with demographic factors and chelation therapy in beta-thalassemia major (beta-TM) patients. This cross-sectional study was conducted on 102 beta-thalassemia (beta-thal), patients. Zinc level was evaluated in subjects using the atomic absorption method. The results were analyzed through descriptive statistics, chi 2 and Mann-Whitney U tests. Of 102 cases, 92 patients were eligible and evaluated. The mean age was 23 (minimum 11, maximum 43) years. Forty-six percent of cases were males and 54.0% were females. Of the 92 patients taking iron chelators, 29.3% used deferoxamine (DFO), 16.3% deferasirox (DFX), 20.6% DFO and deferiprone (DFP), and 33.8% DFO and DFP. All cases had zinc deficiency, 89.1% had zinc levels <40.0 mg/dL, and 10.9% with zinc levels >40.0 mg/dL. There was a significant relationship between gender and group with zinc levels greater than 40.0 mg/dL and those with less than 40.0 mg/dL. Zinc deficiency is highly prevalent among patients with thalassemia in the city of Yasuj, Iran. There was a significant relationship between zinc levels and gender although no significance was observed between zinc level and age, body mass index (BMI), ferritin, and chelation factors; it is recommended that these patients be periodically evaluated for zinc level. In case of a lack of laboratory evaluation, the use of prophylactic zinc supplementation should be considered for these patients.Copyright © 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",Excluded
2709,"Stereotactic body radiation therapy in octogenarians with stage i lung cancer Background The purpose of this study was to describe our clinical experience using stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) to treat medically inoperable stage I non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) in very elderly patients. Patients and Methods Twenty-four consecutive octogenarians with stage I NSCLC were treated with SBRT between 2007 and 2011 at a single center. Median prescription dose was 48 Gy (range, 48-56). Follow-up clinical examination and computed tomography (CT) were performed every 2 to 3 months. Results Median age was 85 years (range, 80-89). Twenty-three (96%) patients had peripheral tumors, and median tumor size was 22 mm (range, 11-49). Tissue diagnosis was obtained in 16 (67%) patients. Median follow-up for all patients was 27.6 months (range, 4.3-61.2). The 24-month disease-free survival was 77% (95% confidence interval [CI], 61%-97%). The 24-month overall survival (OS) was 74% (95% CI, 57%-94%). No local failure (LF) was observed during the period of observation. Nodal failure (NF) and distant failure (DF) occurred in 2 and 4 patients, respectively. The cumulative incidence of competing mortality at 24 months was estimated at 13% (95% CI, 3%-30%). No difference in outcomes with or without tissue diagnosis was observed. No grade >= 3 early or late treatment-related toxicities were observed. Conclusion Octogenarians tolerate SBRT well, which makes it an attractive treatment option. © 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.",Excluded
1443,"Surgical Risk and Survival Associated With Less Invasive Surgery for Malignant Pleural Mesothelioma We compared less invasive surgery with conventional surgery for malignant pleural mesothelioma (MPM). We retrospectively reviewed consecutive patients with MPM who received surgery at Hyogo College of Medicine between July 2004 and April 2016. Patients underwent multimodal treatment comprising chemotherapy (neoadjuvant and/or adjuvant) and surgery with or without 54 Gy hemithoracic radiotherapy. Patients were grouped into 3 groups according to the surgery intended: Conventional extrapleural pneumonectomy was intended in Group 1 (until August 2009); less invasive extrapleural pneumonectomy was intended in Group 2 (after September 2009); pleurectomy/decortication was intended in Group 3 (after September 2012). We included 152 patients (median age 64 [37-71] years; 131 men, 21 women), mostly with epithelioid subtypes (91.4%). Of them, 149 (98.0%) underwent neoadjuvant chemotherapy and 117 (77.0%) underwent surgery (60 had extrapleural pneumonectomy and 57 had pleurectomy/decortication). Macroscopic complete resection was achieved in 94.9% (111/117), and the mortality rates at 30 and 90 days were 1.7% (2/117) and 3.4% (4/117), respectively. The overall median survival time and progression-free survival for all 152 patients were 34.9 and 17.4 months. The overall median survival time for Groups 1, 2, and 3 were 18.5, 41.9, and 43.4 months, respectively. The progression-free survival for Groups 1, 2, and 3 were 12.0, 24.5, and 21.8 months, respectively. Compared with conventional surgical techniques, less invasive surgery for MPM yielded lower surgical risks and comparable or improved survival.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.",Excluded
2184,"Impact of various parameters in detecting chromosomal aberrations by FISH to describe radiosensitivity BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Analysis of radiation-induced chromosomal aberrations is regarded as the ""gold standard"" for classifying individual radiosensitivity. A variety of different parameters can be used. The crucial question, however, is to explore which parameter is suited best to describe the differences between patients with increased radiosensitivity and healthy individuals., PATIENTS AND METHODS: In this study, five patients with severe radiation-induced late effects of at least grade 3, classified according to the Radiation Therapy Oncology Group (RTOG), and eleven healthy individuals were examined retrospectively. Peripheral blood lymphocytes were irradiated in vitro with 0.7 Gy and 2.0 Gy prior to cultivation and stained by means of three-color fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH). The detailed analysis was focused on the number of breaks per metaphase, on breaks from complex chromosomal rearrangements per metaphase, as well as on the percentage of translocations, dicentric chromosomes, breaks, and excess acentric fragments-each in comparison with the total number of mitoses analyzed., RESULTS: Using the number of breaks from complex chromosomal rearrangements after 2.0 Gy, radiosensitive patients as endpoint were clearly to be distinguished (p = 0.001) from healthy individuals. Translocations (p = 0.001) as well as breaks per metaphase (p = 0.002) were also suitable indicators for detecting differences between patients and healthy individuals. The parameters ""percentage of dicentric chromosomes"", ""breaks"", and ""excess acentric fragments"" in comparison to the total number of mitoses analyzed could neither serve as meaningful nor as significant criteria, since they showed a strong interindividual variability., CONCLUSION: To detect a difference in chromosomal aberrations between healthy and radiosensitive individuals, the parameters ""frequency of breaks per metaphase"", ""complex chromosomal rearrangements"", and ""translocations"" are most suitable.",Excluded
189,"Sex-Specific Effects of a Wartime-Like Radiation Exposure on Cognitive Function Evaluating the risk for central nervous system (CNS) effects after whole-body or partial-body irradiation presents challenges due in part to the varied exposure scenarios in the context of occupational, accidental or wartime releases. Risk estimations are further complicated by the fact that robust changes in brain function are unlikely to manifest until significantly late post exposure times. Collectively, the current data regarding CNS radiation risk are conflicting in humans and a survey of the animal model data shows that it is similarly inconsistent. Due to the sparseness of such data, the current study was conducted using male and female mice to evaluate the brain for the delayed effects of a 2 Gy whole-body exposure to c rays starting six months postirradiation. Behavioral testing indicated sex-specific differences in the induction of anxiety-like behaviors and in the ability to abolish fear memories. Molecular analyses showed alterations in post-synaptic protein levels that might affect synaptic plasticity and increased levels of global DNA methylation, suggesting a potential epigenetic mechanism that might contribute to radiation-induced cognitive dysfunction. These data add to the understanding of the CNS response to whole-body irradiation and may lead to improved risk assessment and provide guidance in the development of effective radiation countermeasures to protect military personnel and civilians alike.",Included
972,"MR enterography in the investigation of unexplained abdominal pain Introduction: Magnetic Resonance Enterography (MRE) has an established role in the management of patients with small bowel (SB) Crohn's disease (CD)1 and has the advantages of diagnosing extra-enteric lesions which may be clinically significant2 and being free from the risks of radiation exposure. There is little published data on the use of MRE in the investigation of patients with unexplained chronic abdominal pain. Method(s): A retrospective review of casenotes was conducted of patients who underwent MRE at Southend University Hospital to investigate unexplained abdominal pain and suspected SB disease between January 2008 and October 2010. The patients did not have a pre-existing diagnosis of CD made by colonoscopy or capsule endoscopy (CE). Demographic data, symptoms, previous investigations and final diagnosis were recorded. MRE was performed using a 1.5 Tesla MR scanner following a minimum 6-hour fast and preparation with Klean prep an hour prior to the scan. Two T2-weighted sequences single-shot fast spin-echo and fast imaging employing steady state acquisition were performed in the axial and coronal planes. Result(s): 181 patients (60 male, 121 female) underwent MRE: 43 also had diarrhoea, 14 weight loss and 13 vomiting. The median age was 39 years (range 13 - 85). MRE found clinically significant abnormalities in 33 patients (18.2%): 18/33 had a prior abdominal CT scan, MRE was used to clarify CT findings in 9/33. Findings are as follows: - 12 SB CD (3 CT suggestive) - 3 SB carcinoid tumour (1 CT suggestive, 1 CE suggestive) - 4 adhesional SB obstruction (2 CT abnormal) - 1 SB stricture - 1 gastric GIST - confirmed at resection (normal CT and gastroscopy) - 1 jejunal tumour - adenocarcinoma at resection (normal CT) - 1 duodenal mass with intussusception - villous adenoma at resection (OGD and CT suggestive) - 1 ovarian endometrioma and 1 renal cell carcinoma - confirmed at biopsy or resection - 1 peritoneal metastases - metastatic breast carcinoma at biopsy (CT: colonic thickening and free fluid) - 1 intussusception - 1 splenic mass (CT: splenic mass, granulomatous disease on resection) - 1 retroperitoneal nodes and splenomegaly (CT similar findings, further investigation hypogammaglobulinaemia) - 1 persistent vitello-intestinal cyst (CT normal, confirmed on resection) - 1 gallstones and cholecystitis - 1 PUJ obstruction (CT similar findings) - 1 colonic diverticular disease Conclusion(s): MRE is a useful investigation for unexplained chronic abdominal pain in patients not known to have CD.

1521,"Minimal erythema dose after multiple UV exposures depends on pre-exposure skin pigmentation BACKGROUND/PURPOSE: Phototherapy consists of multiple ultraviolet (UV) exposures. Most previous studies have focused on erythema following a single UV exposure in fair-skinned persons. Although it is well known that phototherapy lowers the daily UV-threshold dose for erythema in clinical practice, this is insufficiently documented under controlled experimental conditions. The purpose of this study was to quantify the change in the daily threshold for a dose specific erythema grade after 1-4 consecutive daily UV exposures., METHODS: Forty-nine healthy volunteers (skin type II-V) with varying pigmentation quantified by skin reflectance. Two UV sources were used: a narrowband UVB (Philips TL01) and a Solar Simulator (Solar Light Co.). Just perceptible erythema after 24 h was chosen as the minimal erythema dose (+); besides + and ++ were assessed., RESULTS: We found a positive and significant exponential relationship between skin pigmentation and UV dose to elicit a specific erythema grade on the back after 1-4 UV exposures. After repetitive UV exposures the UV dose had to be lowered more in dark-skinned persons compared with fair-skinned persons to elicit a certain erythema grade. This applied to both UV sources and all erythema grades., CONCLUSION: In the dark-skinned persons the daily UV dose after the 4 days UV exposure should be lowered by 40-50% to avoid burns compared with the single UV exposure. For the most fair-skinned persons essentially no reduction in the daily UV dose was needed. Our results indicate that the pre-exposure pigmentation level can guide the UV dosage in phototherapy.",Excluded
2720,"Ionizing radiation regulates the expression of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) in epithelial cancer cells: modulation of cellular signals regulating cell cycle and survival PURPOSE: To analyze the (i) expression of AMPK in a variety of epithelial cancer cells, (ii) regulation of AMPK subunit expression by ionizing radiation (IR) and (iii) impact of AMPK on signaling pathways regulating cell cycle and survival., METHODS AND MATERIALS: Human lung, prostate, and breast normal and cancer cells were treated with 0 or 8 Gy IR and mRNA and protein levels of AMPK were evaluated by RT-PCR and immunoblotting 24 or 48 h later. Untreated and radiated wild type (WT) and AMPKalpha(-/-) mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) were analyzed by immunoblotting using total- and phosphorylation-specific antibodies. Histone H2Ax was examined by fluorescence microscopy. The cell cycle and survival of WT and AMPKalpha(-/-) MEFs was also evaluated following 8 Gy by IR., RESULTS: AMPK subunits were found widely expressed in normal and cancer epithelial cells. IR increased subunit protein levels and stimulated gene transcription in cancer cells. AMPKalpha(-/-)-MEFs showed enhanced basal total levels of ATM and phosphorylation of its substrates histone H2Ax, but inhibited response of these markers and of checkpoint kinase Chk2 phosphorylation to IR. AMPKalpha(-/-)-MEFs showed increased basal levels of p53 and cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors p21(cip1), but lack of response of both genes to IR. These cells had increased basal levels and activation of the Akt-mTOR-p70(S6K)/4-EBP1 signalling pathway. IR increased Akt, p70(S6K) and 4-EBP1 phosphorylation in WT-MEFs, but this was reduced in AMPKalpha(-/-)-MEFs. AMPKalpha(-/-)-MEFs failed to arrest at the G2-M checkpoint after IR and showed a trend for radio-resistance in proliferation assays., CONCLUSIONS: AMPK is widely expressed in human normal and cancer epithelial cells and its gene transcription, protein levels, and enzymatic activity is stimulated by IR. Work with AMPKalpha knockout cells suggests that AMPK (i) may mediate a suppressive regulation on basal expression and activity of ATM and its downstream effector pathways Chk2/p53-p21(cip1) and Akt-mTOR, (ii) facilitates the normal response of these pathways to IR and, (iii) mediates the IR-induced G2-M checkpoint.

3576,"Improved discrimination between benign and malignant LDCT screening-detected lung nodules with dynamic over static 18F-FDG PET as a function of injected dose Lung cancer mortality rate can be significantly reduced by up to 20% through routine low-dose computed tomography (LDCT) screening, which, however, has high sensitivity but low specificity, resulting in a high rate of false-positive nodules. Combining PET with CT may provide more accurate diagnosis for indeterminate screening-detected nodules. In this work, we investigated low-dose dynamic 18F-FDG PET in discrimination between benign and malignant nodules using a virtual clinical trial based on patient study with ground truth. Six patients with initial LDCT screening-detected lung nodules received 90min single-bed PET scans following a 10 mCi FDG injection. Low-dose static and dynamic images were generated from under-sampled list-mode data at various count levels (100%, 50%, 10%, 5%, and 1%). A virtual clinical trial was performed by adding nodule population variability, measurement noise, and static PET acquisition start time variability to the time activity curves (TACs) of the patient data. We used receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis to estimate the classification capability of standardized uptake value (SUV) and net uptake constant K i from their simulated benign and malignant distributions. Various scan durations and start times (t *) were investigated in dynamic Patlak analysis to optimize simplified acquisition protocols with a population-based input function (PBIF). The area under curve (AUC) of ROC analysis was higher with increased scan duration and earlier t *. Highly similar results were obtained using PBIF to those using image-derived input function (IDIF). The AUC value for K i using optimized t * and scan duration with 10% dose was higher than that for SUV with 100% dose. Our results suggest that dynamic PET with as little as 1 mCi FDG could provide discrimination between benign and malignant lung nodules with higher than 90% sensitivity and specificity for patients similar to the pilot and simulated population in this study, with LDCT screening-detected indeterminate lung nodules.",Excluded

A relationship between low-density lipoprotein oxidation and radioiodine therapy-related side effects, consequently inducing increased formation of 8-epi-prostaglandin F(2 alpha) (PGF(2 alpha)) in situ, has recently been reported by several investigators. Isoprostanes, among them 8-epi-PGF(2 alpha), have been associated with increased oxidation injury due to various pathologic conditions in vivo. The aim of this study was to investigate the possible induction of oxidative stress as a consequence of (131)I therapy., METHODS: 8-epi-PGF(2 alpha) was examined in plasma, serum, and urine in 42 patients undergoing radioiodine treatment of hyperthyroidism or thyroid cancer. The 8-epi-PGF(2 alpha) levels were analyzed daily for 1 wk and thereafter at different points up to 12 wk after treatment., RESULTS: The isoprostane levels showed an increase after application of radioiodine in all investigated compartments. The effect was significantly higher and longer lasting after higher-activity therapy (2,960 or 7,400 MBq) than after lower-activity therapy (185 or 740 MBq)., CONCLUSION: These findings document a significant, dose-dependent in vivo oxidation injury as a consequence of therapeutic radioiodine application to the salivary gland.",Excluded
480,"Evaluation of cancer tests of 1,3-butadiene using internal dose, genotoxic potency, and a multiplicative risk model In cancer tests with 1,3-butadiene (BD), the mouse is much more sensitive than the rat. This is considered to be related to the metabolism of BD to the epoxide metabolites, 1,2-epoxy-3-butene (EB), 1,2:3,4-diepoxybutane, and 1,2-epoxy-3,4-butanediol. This study evaluates whether the large difference in outcome in cancer tests with BD could be predicted quantitatively on the basis of the concentration over time in blood (AUC) of the epoxide metabolites, their mutagenic potency, and a multiplicative cancer risk model, which has earlier been used for ionizing radiation. Published data on hemoglobin adduct levels from inhalation experiments with BD were used for the estimation of the AUC of the epoxide metabolites in the cancer tests. The estimated AUC of the epoxides were then weighed together to a total genotoxic dose, by using the relative genotoxic potency of the respective epoxide inferred from in vitro hprt mutation assays using EB as standard. The tumor incidences predicted with the risk model on the basis of the total genotoxic dose correlated well with the earlier observed tumor incidences in the cancer tests. The total genotoxic dose that leads to a doubling of the tumor incidences was estimated to be the same in both species, 9 to 10 mmol/Lxh EB-equivalents. The study validates the applicability of the multiplicative cancer risk model to genotoxic chemicals. Furthermore, according to this evaluation, different epoxide metabolites are predominating cancer-initiating agents in the cancer tests with BD, the diepoxide in the mouse, and the monoepoxides in the rat.",Excluded
390,"Diet and melanoma in a case-control study Background: Malignant melanoma has been one of the most rapidly increasing cancers within the United States with few modifiable risk factors. This study investigates risk related to dietary factors, which are potentially modifiable. Method(s): Newly diagnosed patients with melanoma (n = 502) were recruited from pigment lesion clinics and controls (n = 565) were recruited from outpatient clinics. To investigate the relationship between melanoma and dietary factors in this case-control study, study subjects were requested to complete a food frequency questionnaire, which assessed diet over the previous year. Using logistic regression, odds ratios (ORs) for melanoma were computed for nutrient and alcohol intake. Result(s): Persons in high versus low quintiles of energy-adjusted vitamin D, alphacarotene, beta-carotene, cryptoxanthin, lutein, and lycopene had significantly reduced risk for melanoma (ORs <= 0.67), which remained after adjustment for presence of dysplastic nevi, education, and skin response to repeated sun exposure. Addition of micronutrients from supplements did not add an additional reduction in risk. High alcohol consumption was associated with an increased risk for melanoma, which remained after adjustment for confounders [OR (95% confidence interval) in highest versus lowest quintiles, 1.65 (1.09-2.49)]. Conclusion(s): Diets consisting of foods rich in vitamin D and carotenoids and low in alcohol may be associated with a reduction in risk for melanoma.

We investigated the safety of CT angiography (CTA) in a predialysis cohort for evaluation of arterial and venous disease and other pathology that would alter management. Material(s) and Method(s): We reviewed the records of 40 potential renal transplant recipients (24 men and 16 women; age range, 23-79 years) who were investigated with CTA performed on 64-row MDCT scanners after 100 mL Iodixanol 320 (Visipaque, GE Healthcare, Princeton, NJ) IV contrast enhancement. Nonenhanced, arterial, and 2- minute delayed phase thin section (0.625-mm collimation) imaging was performed with 2-mm axial and multiplanar reconstruction, maximum intensity projection, and volume rendering angiographic reconstructions. Pre- and post-CTA serum creatinine (Se Cr) levels were obtained and clinical status observed to time of transplant or up to 7 months post- CTA. Patients underwent pre- and post-CTA hydration as allowed by individual renal status. Result(s): All patients had diagnostic quality CTA studies. Sixteen patients (40%) had major aortoiliac arterial disease that influenced transplantation management or required additional therapy. Eight patients had renal tumors, polycystic kidneys, or other tumors requiring surgical therapy. CTA necessitated additional imaging tests in seven others. Mean pre- and posttransplant Se Cr were 5.2 (range, 2.9-14.1) and 5.1 (range, 2.4-14.2) respectively. Twenty-seven patients had stable or mean decreased Se Cr of 10.2% and 13 had mean increase of 6.3% (range, +/- 32%) post-CTA. No patient required dialysis as a result of CTA. Conclusion(s): CTA with a moderate dose of Iodixanol contrast is a safe and effective procedure with no major clinical impact on renal function in this predialysis population. CTA provided arterial and venous road maps and influenced transplantation management in 40%. Other important findings led to additional surgery in 22% of the group.",Excluded
3381,"Regression models for near-infrared measurement of subcutaneous adipose tissue thickness Obesity is often associated with the risks of diabetes and cardiovascular disease, and there is a need to measure subcutaneous adipose tissue (SAT) thickness for acquiring the distribution of body fat.

Near-infrared signals backscattered from the body surfaces from 40 subjects at 20 body sites each were recorded. Linear regression (LR) and support vector regression (SVR) models were established to predict SAT thickness on different body sites. The measurement accuracy was evaluated by ultrasound, and compared with results from a mechanical skinfold caliper (MSC) and a body composition balance monitor (BCBM). The results showed that both LR- and SVR-based measurement produced better accuracy than MSC and BCBM. It was also concluded that by using regression models specifically designed for certain parts of human body, higher measurement accuracy could be achieved than using a general model for the whole body. Our results demonstrated that the SATmeter is a feasible method, which can be applied at home and in the community due to its portability and convenience.",Excluded

915,"Effects of whole-body UVB irradiation on cytokine production by peripheral blood mononuclear cells from stage I melanoma patients Ultraviolet (UV) radiation causes significant impairment of immunological function in human skin. The immunosuppressive effects of UV radiation are thought to be due to local release of cytokines by human keratinocytes, leading to impaired function of epidermal antigen-presenting cells (APC) and failure to induce cutaneous delayed-type hypersensitivity (DTH) reactions. Recent studies have shown that individuals susceptible to UV-induced suppression of DTH may be more prone to develop skin cancer including malignant melanoma (MM). Since the causal relationship between UV radiation and the induction of MM still seems obscure, we investigated the immunological reactions of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) to whole-body irradiation with UVB in 15 stage I melanoma patients as compared to PBMC from normal volunteers matched for age, gender and skin type. Whole-body irradiation was performed with 0.8 minimal erythema dosages on five consecutive days. Peripheral blood was obtained before and after the procedure. Overall, there were no major effects of UVB irradiation on peripheral lymphocyte subsets and proliferation of PBMC from patients or normal controls, but UVB irradiation led to a significant increase in PWM-stimulated production of IL-6, IL-2R and TNF by PBMC. These changes were independent of the individual UVB dosages administered and appeared in both groups similarly. UVB irradiation did not lead to significant changes on IL-1 and IL-2 expression by PBMC. Our results suggest that PBMC participate in the cytokine response to UV, even in the absence of inflammatory reactions, but that this participation is not specific to MM patients.",Excluded
2073,"Gamma Knife surgery anterior capsulotomy for severe and refractory obsessive-compulsive disorder Clinical article Object: Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is a challenging psychiatric condition associated with anxiety and ritualistic behaviors. Although medical management and psychiatric therapy are effective for many patients, severe and extreme cases may prove refractory to these approaches. The authors evaluated their experience with Gamma Knife (GK) capsulotomy in treating patients with severe OCD. Method(s): A retrospective review of an institutional review board-approved prospective clinical GK database was conducted for patients treated for severe OCD. All patients were evaluated preoperatively by at least one psychiatrist, and their condition was deemed refractory to pharmacological and psychiatric therapy. Result(s): Five patients were identified. Gamma Knife surgery with the GK Perfexion unit was used to target the anterior limb of the internal capsule bilaterally. A single 4-mm isocenter was used; maximum radiation doses of 140-160 Gy were delivered. All 5 patients were preoperatively and postoperatively assessed for clinical response by using both subjective and objective metrics, including the Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale (YBOCS); 4 of the 5 patients had postoperative radiological follow-up. The median clinical follow-up was 24 months (range 6-33 months). At the time of radiosurgery, all patients had YBOCS scores in the severe or extreme range (median 32, range 31-34). At the last follow-up, 4 (80%) of the 5 patients showed marked clinical improvement; in the remaining patient (20%), mild improvement was seen. The median YBOCS score was 13 (range 12-31) at the last follow-up. Neuroimaging studies at 6 months after GK treatment demonstrated a small area of enhancement corresponding to the site of the isocenter and some mild T2 signal changes in the internal capsule. No adverse clinical effects were noted from the radiosurgery. Conclusion(s): for patients with severe OCD refractory to medications and psychiatric therapy, GK capsulotomy afforded clinical improvement. Further study of this approach seems warranted. © AANS, 2013.",Excluded

The respiratory burst activity of neutrophils was measured fluorometrically using dichlorofluorescein diacetate, the total anti-oxidant status was measured using azinodiethyl-benzthiazoline-sulphonate, and inflammation parameters were determined by routine laboratory assays., RESULTS: Before treatment, the basal neutrophil respiratory burst in patients (n = 20) was 409 +/- 62 fluorescence arbitrary units (AU; mean +/- SEM) and 359 +/- 37 AU in controls (n = 9; p > 0.5); the stimulated respiratory burst (fMet-Leu-Phe, 10(-6) M) was 1,027 +/- 133 AU in patients and 1,152 +/- 218 AU in controls (p > 0.5). After treatment, the basal neutrophil respiratory burst in patients (n = 19) was 137 +/- 16 and in controls it was 174 +/- 35 AU (n = 8; p > 0.1); the stimulated respiratory burst was 670 +/- 66 and 1,305 +/- 82 AU, in patients and controls respectively (p < 0.001). No effects of treatment on the total anti-oxidant status of the plasma or on the parameters of inflammation were detected., CONCLUSION: Combined radon-hyperthermia treatment reduces the respiratory burst activity of the blood circulating neutrophils in patients with AS. If respiratory burst activity from the neutrophils plays a role in the pathophysiology of ankylosing spondylitis, the observed reduction may be related to the beneficial effects of radon-hyperthermia treatment.",Included

For comparison of BEDs, the prescribed dose for SBRT was stratified according to three groups: high (BED > 146 Gy), medium to high (BED, 106 to 146 Gy), and low to medium (BED < 106 Gy). Result(s): For all patients, the overall local control rate was 85.3% at two years after treatment. Five local recurrences were observed, and, notably, all of them were observed in the low to medium BED group. Significantly higher local control rates were observed for patients with a complete response than for those with a partial response or stable disease (p < 0.001). Twenty-six patients with a tumor size of < 3 cm showed no dose-response relationship in the low to medium, medium to high, and high BED groups, whereas eight patients with a tumor size of = 3 cm showed a significant dose-response relationship. The observed 2-year local recurrence-free survival rates in patients with a tumor size of < 3 cm and in those with a tumor size of = 3 cm were 96.2% and 50.0%, respectively, which were significantly different (p=0.007). Conclusion(s): BED > 100 Gy is required in order to achieve a > 85% local control rate regardless of tumor size. The optimal dose for small tumors of < 3 cm appears to be within a range below 150 Gy BED. Escalation of BED to high levels (> 150 Gy) may be required for patients with a tumor size larger than 3 cm.Copyright © 2014 by the Korean Cancer Association.",Excluded
1941,"Dynamic multidetector CT and non-contrast-enhanced MR for right adrenal vein imaging: comparison with catheter venography in adrenal venous sampling OBJECTIVES: To evaluate visualization of the right adrenal vein (RAV) with multidetector CT and non-contrast-enhanced MR imaging in patients with primary aldosteronism., METHODS: A total of 125 patients (67 men) scheduled for adrenal venous sampling (AVS) were included. Dynamic 64-detector-row CT and balanced steady-state free precession-based non-contrast-enhanced 3-T MR imaging were performed. RAV visualization based on a four-point score was documented. Both anatomical location and variation on cross-sectional imaging were evaluated, and the findings were compared with catheter venography as the gold standard., RESULTS: The RAV was visualized in 93.2% by CT and 84.8% by MR imaging (p = 0.02). Positive predictive values of RAV visualization were 100% for CT and 95.2% for MR imaging. Imaging score was significantly higher in CT than MR imaging (p < 0.01). The RAV formed a common trunk with an accessory hepatic vein in 16% of patients. The RAV orifice level on cross-sectional imaging was concordant with catheter venography within the range of 1/3 vertebral height in >70% of subjects. Success rate of AVS was 99.2%., CONCLUSIONS: Dynamic CT is a reliable way to map the RAV prior to AVS. Non-contrast-enhanced MR imaging is an alternative when there is a risk of complication from contrast media or radiation exposure., KEY POINTS: Dynamic CT and non-contrast-enhanced MR imaging detect the right adrenal vein (RAV). Dynamic CT can visualize the RAV more than non-contrast-enhanced MR imaging. Mapping the RAV helps to achieve successful adrenal venous sampling. Sixteen per cent of RAVs share the common trunk with accessory hepatic veins.",Excluded
1881,"86Y-DOTA0)-D-Phe1-Tyr3-octreotide (SMT487)--a phase 1 clinical study: pharmacokinetics, biodistribution and renal protective effect of different regimens of amino acid co-infusion The pharmacokinetics and dosimetry of (86)Y-DOTA(0)- d-Phe(1)-Tyr(3)-octreotide ((86)Y-SMT487) were evaluated in a phase I positron emission tomography (PET) study of 24 patients with somatostatin receptor-positive neuroendocrine tumours. The effect of amino acid (AA) co-infusion on renal and tumour uptake was assessed in a cross-over randomised setting. Five regimens were tested: no infusion, 4-h infusion of 120 g mixed AA (26.4 g l-lysine + l-arginine), 4 h l-lysine (50 g), 10 h 240 g mixed AA (52.8 g l-lysine + l-arginine) and 4 h Lys-Arg (25 g each). Comparisons were performed on an intra-patient basis. Infusions of AA started 0.5 h prior to injection of (86)Y-SMT487 and PET scans were obtained at 4, 24 and 48 h p.i. Absorbed doses to tissues were computed using the MIRD3 method. (86)Y-SMT487 displayed rapid plasma clearance and exclusive renal excretion; uptake was noted in kidneys, tumours, spleen and, to a lesser extent, liver. The 4-h mixed AA co-infusion significantly ( P<0.05) reduced (86)Y-SMT487 renal uptake by a mean of 21%. This protective effect was significant on the dosimetry data (3.3+/-1.3 vs 4.4+/-1.0 mGy/MBq; P<0.05) and was further enhanced upon prolonging the infusion to 10 h (2.1+/-0.4 vs 1.7+/-0.2 mGy/MBq; P<0.05). Infusion of Lys-Arg but not of l-lysine was more effective in reducing renal uptake than mixed AA. Infusion of AA did not result in reduced tumour uptake. The amount of (90)Y-SMT487 (maximum allowed dose: MAD) that would result in a 23-Gy cut-off dose to kidneys was calculated for each study: MAD was higher with mixed AA co-infusion by a mean of 46% (10-114%, P<0.05 vs no infusion). In comparison with 4 h mixed AA, the MAD was higher by a mean of 23% (9-37%; P<0.05) with prolonged infusion and by a mean of 16% (2-28%; P<0.05) with Lys-Arg. We conclude that infusion of large amounts of AA reduces renal exposure during peptide-based radiotherapy and allows higher absorbed doses to tumours. The prolongation of the infusion from 4 to 10 h further enhances the protective effect on the kidneys.",Excluded
1422,"Outcomes of carotid angioplasty and stenting for radiation-associated stenosis BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: In light of their high surgical risk, carotid angioplasty and stent placement may be preferred in patients with radiation-associated carotid stenosis. The purpose of this study was to determine the procedural complication rate, patency, and clinical outcomes after carotid angioplasty and stent placement in this small group of high-risk patients., METHODS: Sixteen patients (mean age, 65 years; 5 women and 11 men) who received radiation therapy for head and/or neck malignancy subsequently developed carotid stenosis (mean, 84%; range, 70%-99%) in a total of 19 carotid arteries, which were treated with angioplasty and stent placement. The patients were followed for a mean time of 28 months (range, 5-78 months) with periodic Doppler studies, angiography, CT angiography, or clinically., RESULTS: In the total 19 stented carotid arteries, 23 procedures were performed (22 stent placement procedures and one repeat angioplasty). The procedural stroke rate was 1/23 (4%). The procedural transient ischemic attack rate was 0/23 (0%). There was one other observed complication: a puncture site hematoma. The 30-day postprocedure complication rate was 0/23 (0%); no neurologic symptoms were reported. Fifteen of the 19 vessels (79%) developed no new stenosis throughout the follow-up period. Two of 19 (11%) vessels had repeat angioplasty and stent placement; 1/19 (5%) had a repeat angioplasty. One restented vessel has remained patent for 50 months. Another restented vessel required a third stent placement 17 months after the second. Two of 19 (11%) vessels occluded per Doppler examination 14 and 22 months postprocedure., CONCLUSION: Angioplasty and stent placement have low rates of complications and restenosis in the treatment of radiation-associated carotid occlusive disease.",Excluded
531,"Extramedullary plasmacytoma: Clinical and histopathologic study Purpose: To review the histories of extramedullary plasmacytoma patients diagnosed in Slovenia between 1969 and 1999, to determine the relationship between radiotherapy (XRT) dose and local tumor control, and to clarify the role of elective nodal XRT and the prognostic value of Bartl's histologic grading criteria (originally devised for multiple myeloma [MM]). Methods and Materials: The database of the Cancer Registry of Slovenia was used for the identification of patients. The inclusion criteria were as follows: bone marrow biopsy showing less than 10% plasma cells, normal skeletal survey, and immunohistochemically determined tumor monoclonality. Simulation/portal films were reviewed to assess the extent of elective nodal XRT. Result(s): Twenty-six patients with 31 tumors fulfilled the inclusion criteria. In 4 patients, nine metachronously appearing solitary tumors were diagnosed. The head-and-neck region and other body sites were the sites of origin of primary tumors in 84% and 16% of patients, respectively, whereas in the two regions, regional disease was seen in 15% and 60% of patients, respectively. Therapy was as follows: XRT, 12 patients; surgery and postoperative XRT, 15 patients; and surgery, 4 patients. Ultimate local and regional control rates were 90% and 97%, respectively, and MM developed in 2 (8%) patients. The 10-year disease-specific and overall survival rates were 87% and 61%, respectively. The analysis of the dose-effect relationship showed that more conservative treatment is justified: for macroscopic disease, 40-50 Gy (2 Gy/day), adjusted to the bulk of disease; for microscopic disease, 36-40 Gy; after R0 surgery, no XRT is required, but close observation is needed. No attempts should be made to treat uninvolved nodal regions. Using Bartl's histologic grading criteria, trends were detected in patients with higher tumor grades: regional lymph node involvement (p = 0.04) and shorter disease-specific survival (p = 0.08). Conclusion(s): Extramedullary plasmacytoma is a highly curable disease when XRT is used with or without previous surgery. The rate of conversion to MM is low. Moderate-dose XRT using limited fields is recommended. The prognostic value of Bartl's grading system needs further evaluation. © 2002 Elsevier Science Inc.",Excluded
3441,"Failure of cardioxane (ICRF-187, dexrazoxane) to limit peroxidative heart damage in rats after gamma irradiation or farmorubicin (4'- epidoxorubicin) treatment The ability of Cardioxane to protect against the peroxidative type of heart damage induced by a single treatment with farmorubicin (10 mg/kg ip) or ionizing radiation (20 Gy gamma rays) as well was investigated in WAG strain rats. Cardioxane in doses 20 mg/kg was applied ip 1 h before and 20 h after farmorubicin treatment or 30 min before and 20 h after irradiation. The early markers of peroxidative damage were thiobarbituric acid-reactive substances (TBA-RS) in serum and heart homogenate, and the cytoplasmic enzyme creatine kinase CK (CPK) activity in serum. Results indicate that Cardioxane in clinically relevant doses did not exert a protective effect against oxidative reactions and did not significantly influence the changes of serum enzyme level observed after both cardiotoxic agents. Furthermore, Cardioxane alone induced a small but significant increase of TBA-RS in serum and heart tissue, providing additional toxicity.",Excluded
51,"Effects of different gamma exposure regimes on reproduction in the earthworm Eisenia fetida (Oligochaeta) Ecological risk assessment of ionising radiation requires knowledge about the responses of individuals and populations to chronic exposures, including situations when exposure levels change over time. The present study investigated processes such as recovery and the adaptive response with respect to reproduction endpoints in the earthworm Eisenia fetida exposed to (60)Co gamma-radiation. Furthermore, a crossed experiment was performed to investigate the influence of F0 parental and F1 embryonic irradiation history on the response of irradiated or non-irradiated F1 offspring. Recovery: The sterility induced by sub-chronic exposure at 17 m Gy/h (accumulated dose: 25 Gy) was temporary, and 8 weeks after irradiation the worms had regained their reproductive capacity (number of viable offspring produced per adult per week). Adaptive response: Adult worms were continuously exposed at a low priming dose rate of 0.14 mGy/h for 12 weeks (accumulated dose: 0.24 Gy), followed by 14 weeks exposure at a challenge dose rate of 11 mGy/h. The results suggest a lack of adaptive response, since there were no significant differences in the effects on reproduction capacity between the primed and the unprimed groups after challenge doses ranging from 7.6 to 27 Gy. Crossed experiment: The effects of exposure at 11 mGy/h for 21 weeks on growth, sexual maturation and reproduction of offspring, derived either from parent worms and cocoons both exposed at 11 mGy/h, or from non-irradiated parents and cocoons (total accumulated dose 44 and 38 Gy, respectively) were compared. There were no significant differences between the two exposed offspring groups for any of the endpoints. The reproduction capacity was very low for both groups compared to the controls, but the reproduction seemed to be maintained at the reduced level, which could indicate acclimatisation or stabilisation. Finally, parental and embryonic exposures at 11 mGy/h did not affect reproduction in the F1 offspring as adults. Copyright © 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",Excluded
2271,"Prevalence of less severe hypercortisolism in fractured patients admitted in an outpatient clinic for metabolic bone diseases Purpose: To evaluate the prevalence of less severe hypercortisolism (LSH) in fractured patients, and its association with hypertension, hyperglicemia, dyslipidemia, and obesity. Method(s): From July 2015 to October 2018 we enrolled all fractured patients admitted in our outpatient center for metabolic bone diseases, after exclusion of patients with secondary osteoporosis apart from diabetes and taking drugs known to affect bone metabolism. In all enrolled patients we collected data regarding gonadal status, history of diabetes, high blood pressure, dyslipidemia, and measured blood pressure, lipid profile, fasting glycaemia. Bone mass was measured with DXA at lumbar spine and femoral neck and the presence of fractures was evaluated with X-ray of thoracic and lumbar spine. All patients performed twice, 1 mg overnight dexametasone suppression test (DST) and, as confirmatory, 2day low-dose DST for diagnosing hypercortisolism. Result(s): We enrolled 101 fractured patients (75 females, 26 males), aged 65 +/- 10.3 years. Five out of 101 (5.0%) patients were diagnosed as LSH. Fifty-five (54.5%) out of 101 were hypertensive, 57 (56.4%) dyslipidemic, 17 (16.8%) hyperglicaemic, 28(27.7%) obese patients. LSH tended to be associated to blood hypertension [5/5 vs 50/96 (Fisher exact test, p = 0.06) hypertensive patients]. Four out five LSH patients were hypogonadic. Conclusion(s): Our study confirms that a nonnegligible percentage of fractured subjects actually presents an unrecognized hypercortisolism. Accordingly, regardless of age, we suggest to screen for hypercortisolism all patients with established osteoporosis and in particular hypertensive subjects.Copyright © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC part of Springer Nature.",Excluded
75,"Targeted alpha particle immunotherapy for myeloid leukemia Unlike beta particle-emitting isotopes, a emitters can selectively kill individual cancer cells with a single atomic decay. HuM195, a humanized anti-CD33 monoclonal antibody, specifically targets myeloid leukemia cells and has activity against minimal disease. When labeled with the beta-emitters 131I and 90Y, HuM195 can eliminate large leukemic burdens in patients, but it produces prolonged myelosuppression requiring hematopoietic stem cell transplantation at high doses. To enhance the potency of native HuM195 yet avoid the nonspecific cytotoxicity of beta-emitting constructs, the alpha-emitting isotope 213Bi was conjugated to HuM195. Eighteen patients with relapsed and refractory acute myelogenous leukemia or chronic myelomonocytic leukemia were treated with 10.36 to 37.0 MBq/kg 213Bi-HuM195. No significant extramedullary toxicity was seen. All 17 evaluable patients developed myelosuppression, with a median time to recovery of 22 days. Nearly all the 213Bi-HuM195 rapidly localized to and was retained in areas of leukemic involvement, including the bone marrow, liver, and spleen. Absorbed dose ratios between these sites and the whole body were 1000-fold greater than those seen with beta-emitting constructs in this antigen system and patient population. Fourteen (93%) of 15 evaluable patients had reductions in circulating blasts, and 14 (78%) of 18 patients had reductions in the percentage of bone marrow blasts. This study demonstrates the safety, feasibility, and antileukemic effects of 213Bi-HuM195, and it is the first proof-of-concept for systemic targeted a particle immunotherapy in humans. © 2002 by The American Society of Hematology.",Excluded

3348,"Impact of radiotherapy dose on dentition breakdown in head and neck cancer patients Purpose: To evaluate the severity of post-radiation dental lesions and possible correlation with radiation dose to the teeth in patients treated for head and neck cancers. Methods and Materials: Data from 93 head and neck radiotherapy patients treated between 1997 and 2008 were analyzed retrospectively. The main effect, radiation dose to the individual teeth, was evaluated with covariates of elapsed time after radiation, xerostomia, topical fluoride use, and oral hygiene status included. Patients' radiotherapy plans were used to calculate cumulative exposure for each tooth. Patients' teeth were evaluated using a validated index and then categorized as having none-slight or moderate-severe post-radiation damage. Result(s): Patients (31 females, 62 males) ranged in age from 18-82 years (mean 57). The number of teeth-patient ranged from 3-30 (mean 20) with a total of 1873 teeth evaluated. Overall, 51% of teeth had moderate-severe damage, with the remaining having little or none. Using odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals, the odds for moderate-severe damage were 2-3 times greater for teeth exposed to between 30 and 60 Gy as compared to no radiation. However, for teeth exposed to >= 60 Gy as compared to no radiation the odds of moderate-severe tooth damage was greater by a magnitude of 10 times. Conclusion(s): The results indicate that there is minimal tooth damage below 30 Gy (salivary gland threshold), a greater than 1:1 increased dose-response between 30 and 60 Gy likely related to salivary gland damage, and a critical threshold of >= 60 Gy, which may be linked to direct effects of radiation on tooth structure. These findings suggest that care should be taken during the treatment planning process to limit tooth dose, and when clinically possible to limit tooth dose to less than 60 Gy. © 2011 American Society for Radiation Oncology.",Excluded
1588,"Irradiation of adult human dental pulp stem cells provokes activation of p53, cell cycle arrest, and senescence but not apoptosis Adult human dental pulp contains stem cells (DPSCs) that are capable of differentiation into osteoblasts, odontoblasts, adipocytes, and neuronal-like cells. Because these cells have potential use in tissue regeneration, herein we characterized the response of DPSC lines to ionizing radiation (IR). These DPSC lines have been developed from the extracted molars of healthy donors. DPSCs were cultivated in a unique media supplemented with epidermal growth factor (EGF) and platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF). Since tissue homeostasis depends on a precise balance among cell proliferation, senescence, and cell death, we explored the effects of IR (2-20 Gy) on the proliferative activity of DPSCs and the molecular pathways involved. Even the highest dose used (20 Gy) did not induce DPSC apoptosis. After irradiation with doses of 6 and 20 Gy, DPSCs accumulated in the G2 phase of the cell cycle. DPSCs responded to IR (20 Gy) with senescence detected as SA-beta-galactosidase positivity, beginning on the third day after irradiation. Twenty-four hours after irradiation, p53 and its serine 15 and 392 phosphorylated forms were detected. At this time, p21 (WAF1) was induced. Increases in protein p16 were observed from the third day following irradiation and continued till the end of the examination (Day 13). We conclude that DPSCs respond to IR-induced damage by permanent cell cycle arrest in the G2 phase and by stress-induced premature senescence. © 2010, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.",Included
3006,"Latent and lytic Epstein-Barr virus gene expression in the peripheral blood of astronauts Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) latent and replicative gene transcription was analyzed in peripheral blood B-lymphocytes from astronauts who flew on short-duration (~11 days) Shuttle missions and long-duration (~180 days) International Space Station (ISS) missions. Latent, immediate-early, and early gene replicative viral transcripts were detected in samples from six astronauts who flew on short-duration Shuttle missions, whereas viral gene transcription was mostly absent in samples from 24 healthy donors. Samples from six astronauts who flew on long-duration ISS missions were characterized by expanded expression of latent, immediate-early, and early gene transcripts and new onset expression of late replicative transcription upon return to Earth. These data indicate that EBV-infected cells are no longer expressing the restricted set of viral genes that characterize latency but are expressing latent and lytic gene transcripts. These data also suggest the possibility of EBV-related complications in future long-duration missions, in particular interplanetary travel. © 2011 Wiley-Liss, Inc.",Excluded

Method(s): Thirteen patients aged between 18 and 33 years old with maxillary transverse deficiency (>=7.0 mm) were evaluated. All patients underwent subtotal Le Fort I osteotomy with separation of the pterygomaxillary suture with the use of Hyrax expander, and were divided into 2 groups: control group (n = 6) and laser group (n = 7). A GaAlAs laser (P = 100 mW, lambda = 830 nm, O = 0.06 cm2) was used. The laser was applied in 8 treatment sessions with intervals of 48 hours. Each treatment session consisted of laser applications, per point (E = 8.4J, ED = 140J/cm2), at 3 points on the MPAS, and total dose of E = 25.2 J, ED = 420 J/cm2. Digital radiographs were taken before the surgical procedure and at 1-, 2-, 3-, 4-, and 7-month follow-up visits. Optical density analysis of the regenerated bone was performed using Adobe Photoshop 8.0 software. Result(s): Bone regeneration associated with the use of laser after SARME showed a statistically significant difference. A higher mineralization rate was found in the laser group (26.3%, P < .001) than the control group. Conclusion(s): Low-level laser irradiation (GaAlAs) accelerates bone regeneration in MPAS after SARME. However, the optical density measurements after 7 months of follow-up were lower in comparison with the preoperative measurements. © 2010 Mosby, Inc. All rights reserved.",Excluded

The study included 15 patients. The prescribed doses included a standard dose (50.4 Gy) and a high dose (60 Gy) for the planning target volume (PTV) of the involved lesions. The objective of the whole lung volume receiving >= 20 Gy (V20Gy) was < 30%, and the mean lung dose (MLD) was < 20 Gy. The volumes of the lung receiving 5 Gy (V5Gy) and the heart receiving 30-50 Gy (V30-50Gy) were kept as low as reasonably achievable. As a result, SIB-VMAT showed superior dose conformity for the PTV (p<0.001). Although the lung V5Gy was significantly increased (p<0.001), the V20Gy and MLD showed no significant increase. The heart V30-50Gy showed a > 20% reduction in the mean against 3D-CRTs. Our results demonstrate the feasibility of SIB-VMAT for the treatment of middle or lower esophageal cancer with ENI. Although attention should be paid to the low-dose area of the lungs, SIB-VMAT would be a promising treatment option with improved outcomes for esophageal cancer.",Excluded
3397,"X-ray enhancement of splenic rosette-forming cells in nonimmune mice The formation of rosettes between spleen cells from nonimmune mice and sheep red blood cells (SRBC) has been investigated. The number of splenic rosette-forming cells (RFC) in the intact spleen was very low but greatly increased after sublethal whole body x-irradiation. These cells were inhibited by pretreatment of the cells with AKR anti-C3H- antigen antiserum, in the presence of fresh guinea pig serum, but not with rabbit anti-mouse immunoglobulin antiserum. The splenic RFC also increased after cortisone acetate administration into mice. These results suggest that the RFC are a T cell sub-population having x-ray resistant and cortisone-insensitive characteristics. The x-irradiation of mice in vivo selectively increased the number of splenic RFC in consequence of reduction in the number of cells having non-T cell characteristics. These RFC are presumably antigen-specific sheep red blood cell rosettes, a quite different situation as in the case of human T lymphocyte rosette formation.",Included

Method(s): Sixteen male and 12 female patients aged 17-67 years (mean 31.3 years) were retrospectively identified among 868 patients who underwent GKS for AVM at our hospital. The pathological characteristics of the reddish nodular lesion and chronic encapsulated expanding haematoma associated with cyst following GKS for AVM were examined. Result(s): Cyst was associated with chronic encapsulated expanding haematoma in 13, and with nodular lesion in 12 patients. The nidus volume at GKS was 0.1-36 ml (median 6.0 ml), and the prescription dose at the nidus margin was 18-25 Gy (median 20 Gy). Cyst formation was detected from 1.1 to 16 years (mean 7.3 years) after GKS. Seven of the 12 patients with nodular lesion underwent surgery. Ten of the 13 patients with expanding haematoma underwent surgical removal of expanding haematoma. Histological examination was possible in 17 cases. Dilated capillary vessels with wall damage such as hyalinisation and fibrinoid necrosis, marked protein exudation and haemorrhage were the most common findings. Brain parenchyma was observed among the dilated vessels in some cases. Structureless necrotic tissue was not evident. Conclusion(s): The present study suggests that enhanced nodular lesion on magnetic resonance imaging and chronic encapsulated expanding haematoma associated with cyst may have common aetiopathology caused by late radiation effects, mainly consisting of dilated capillary vessels with wall damage. Massive protein exudation from such damaged capillary vessels is important in cyst development.Copyright © 2014, Springer-Verlag Wien.",Excluded

Methods Texture features were extracted from 115 lesions: 32 of them previously diagnosed as radiation necrosis, 23 as radiation-treated metastasis and 60 untreated metastases; including a total of 179 features derived from six texture analysis methods. A feature selection technique based on support vector machine was used to obtain a subset of features that provide optimal performance. Results The highest classification accuracy evaluated over test sets was achieved with a subset of ten features when the untreated metastases were not considered; and with a subset of seven features when the classifier was trained with untreated metastases and tested on treated ones. Receiver operating characteristic curves provided area-under-the-curve (mean+/-standard deviation) of 0.94+/-0.07 in the first case, and 0.93+/-0.02 in the second.

Forty-nine patients had a solitary lesion and 29 had multiple (2-6) lesions. The median SRT dose was 15 Gy (11-24 Gy) in single fraction for 38 lesions, and 24 Gy (11-40 Gy) in 2-6 fractions for 84 lesions. SRT was combined with whole brain radiotherapy (WBRT) of 30-40 Gy for 39 patients. Progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) were estimated by Kaplan-Meier method. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed by the log-rank test and Cox model, respectively. Result(s): The median survival time was 12.9 months (1.7-77.4 months). The 1-year intracranial PFS rate was 87.4%. The 1- and 2-year OS rates were 53.9% and 25.8%, respectively. Univariate analysis showed that the 1-year OS rates were higher In the patients with pretreatment KPS of s= 70, extracranial lesions controlled, or SRT combined with WBRT than in those with KPS of < 70 (60.7% vs. 29.4%, P = 0.002), extracranial lesions uncontrolled (69% vs. 44.9%, P = 0.005), or SRT alone (64.1% vs. 43.4%, P = 0.03). The benefit of treating with WBRT in combination was mainly achieved in the patients with extracranial lesions controlled or with more than one Intracranial lesion. Multivariate analysis showed that KPS score and status of extracranial lesions were independent prognostic factors for OS. Conclusion(s): SRT is an effective and safe modality for BM. SRT combined with WBRT may prolong the survival time of the patients with extracranial lesions controlled or multiple Intracranial lesions. Independent prognostic factors for OS are KPS score and status of extracranial lesions.",Excluded
1983,"Increased occurrence of exfoliation in the male, Spanish American population of New Mexico Exfoliation syndrome was found to occur much more frequently in the male Spanish American population of New Mexico. This was based on a Veterans Administration Medical Center study in Albuquerque, New Mexico. The prevalence of exfoliation in the Spanish Americans was estimated to be from 3-6 percent and this is consistent with many other such studies performed in the United States and other countries. The Spanish American population is 5.8 times more likely to develop exfoliation than the non-Spanish American population of New Mexico. Exfoliation was found on such eye structures as the lens, iris, ciliary processes, posterior capsule, vitreous face, posterior corneal surface, and arterial chamber angle. Glaucoma capsulare was also studied and it was found that there was not a significant difference between the Spanish American and the non-Spanish American population for developing the condition. However, there was a strong association of glaucoma with the presence of exfoliation in both groups. Based on our results, patients with exfoliation are 22 times more likely to develop glaucoma than are their age-matched controls. Also, 40 percent of the exfoliation patients had glaucoma compared with only 5 percent of the age-matched controls (p less than .001). The patients with glaucoma capsulare were found to have a more medically resistant type of glaucoma, which was consistent with other reports of this condition. There are two theories we propose for the existence of exfoliation in the Spanish American population of New Mexico. The first is a geographic climatic theory that relates exfoliation to greater solar radiation levels due to a high overall altitude and sunny weather in New Mexico.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",Excluded
882,"Mild toxicity and favorable prognosis of high-dose and extended involved-field intensity-modulated radiotherapy for patients with early-stage nasal NK/T-cell lymphoma Purpose: The value of intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) for early-stage nasal NK/T-cell lymphoma has not been previously reported. The aim of the present study was to assess the dosimetric parameters, toxicity, and treatment outcomes of patients with nasal NK/T-cell lymphoma. Methods and Materials: Between 2003 and 2008, 42 patients with early-stage nasal NK/T-cell lymphoma underwent definitive high-dose and extended involved-field IMRT with or without combination chemotherapy. The median radiation dose to the primary tumor was 50 Gy. The dose-volume histograms of the target volume and critical normal structures were evaluated in all patients. The locoregional control, overall survival, and progression-free survival were calculated using the Kaplan-Meier method. Result(s): The average mean dose delivered to the planning target volume was 55.5 Gy. Only 1.3% and 2.5% of the planning target volume received <90% and 95% of the prescribed dose, respectively, indicating excellent planning target volume coverage. The mean dose and average dose to the parotid glands was 15 Gy and 14 Gy, respectively. With a median follow-up time of 27 months, the 2-year locoregional control, overall survival, and progression-free survivalrate was 93%, 78%, and 74%, respectively. No Grade 4 or 5 acute or late toxicity was reported. Conclusion(s): High-dose and extended involved-field IMRT for patients with early-stage nasal NK/T-cell lymphoma showed favorable locoregional control, overall survival, and progression-free survival, with mild toxicity. The dose constraints of IMRT for the parotid glands can be limited to <20 Gy in these patients. © 2012 Elsevier Inc.",Excluded
3546,"Linear accelerator-based stereotactic body radiation therapy in the treatment of oligometastatic disease The present study reports the clinical outcomes of hypofractionated stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) for oligometastasis (OM) originating from various tumors. Between February 2012 and April 2017, 40 patients with unresectable OM were treated with SBRT. Of these patients, 92% showed a solitary nodal metastasis and the rest had up to three metas-tases. The dose prescription was 50 Gy in 10 fractions with three-dimensional conformal techniques or volumetric inten-sity-modulated arc therapy. Median follow-up was 14 months. Of the 40 patients, none showed local progression at the site of SBRT, but 20 patients showed tumor growth at distant sites during follow-up. The 2- and 3-year overall survival rates were 45.1 and 36.1%, respectively. The 2- and 3-year progression-free survival rates were 35.4 and 26.5%, respectively. The interval between diagnosis and detection of OM (<2 vs. >2 years) and primary tumor site (esophagus vs. others) emerged as significant variables affecting survival. Grade 3 subacute and grade 4 chronic toxicities were observed in 1 and 2 patients, respectively. SBRT of 50 Gy in 10 fractions for OM from various primary tumors was shown to lead to good clinical outcomes from the viewpoints of local control and toxicity frequency. However, additional studies are required to identify the patient groups likely to receive maximal benefits from such treatment.Copyright © 2020, Spandidos Publications. All rights reserved.",Excluded
591,"Predictors of pulmonary toxicity in limited stage small cell lung cancer patients treated with induction chemotherapy followed by concurrent platinum-based chemotherapy and 70Gy daily radiotherapy: CALGB 30904 Introduction: Standard therapy for limited stage small cell lung cancer (L-SCLC) is concurrent chemotherapy and radiotherapy followed by prophylactic cranial radiotherapy. Predictors of post chemoradiotherapy pulmonary toxicity in limited stage (LS) small cell lung cancer (SCLC) patients are not well defined. Current guidelines are derived from non-small cell lung cancer regimens, and do not account for the unique biology of this disease. Therefore, we analyzed patients on three consecutive CALGB LS-SCLC trials treated with concurrent chemotherapy and daily high dose radiotherapy (70. Gy) to determine patient and treatment related factors predicting for post-treatment pulmonary toxicity. Method(s): Patients treated on CALGB protocols 39808, 30002, 30206 investigating two cycles of chemotherapy followed by concurrent chemotherapy and 70. Gy daily thoracic radiation therapy were pooled. Patient, tumor, and treatment related factors were evaluated to determine predictors of grade 3-5 pulmonary toxicities after concurrent chemoradiotherapy. Result(s): 100 patients were included. No patient experienced grade 4-5 post-treatment pulmonary toxicity. Patients who experienced post-treatment pulmonary toxicity were more likely to be older (median age 69 vs 60, p= 0.09) and have smaller total lung volumes (2565 cc vs 3530 cc, p= 0.05).). Furthermore, exposure of larger volumes of lung to lower (median V5. = 70%, p= 0.09, median V10. = 63%, p= 0.07), intermediate (median V20. = 50, p= 0.04) and high (median V60. = 25%, p= 0.01) doses of radiation were all associated with post-treatment grade 3 pulmonary toxicity, as was a larger mean lung radiation dose (median 31. Gy) p= 0.019. Conclusion(s): Post-treatment pulmonary toxicity following the completion of 2 cycles of chemotherapy followed by concurrent chemotherapy and high dose daily radiation therapy was uncommon. Care should be taken to minimize mean lung radiation exposure, as well as volumes of low, intermediate and high doses of radiation. © 2013 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.",Excluded
1671,"Histological examination in assessment of ultraviolet-induced suppression of contact hypersensitivity response The evaluation of contact hypersensitivity (CHS) reaction is one of the methods used in the assessment of the immune status of an organism after UV radiation. The aim of the study was to compare usefulness of visual scoring system and histological morphometry in the assessment of CHS response after exposure of humans to solar simulated radiation (SSR). The study included 140 healthy volunteers, 33 people were irradiated for 2 days, 34 - for 10 days and 33 - for 30 days with SSR. Forty non-irradiated individuals served as controls. All the volunteers were sensitized with diphenylocyclopropenone (DPCP) 24 h after final exposure. Statistical analysis comparing intensity of CHS reaction based on visual score between irradiated groups and non-irradiated group revealed no differences (p>0.05). We found a significant difference in epidermal thickness between healthy skin and irradiated groups (p<0.05) and a positive correlation between intensity of spongiosis and clinical score for CHS response at 3.2 DPCP site (p<0.000001). A negative correlation between time of irradiation and spongiosis score was revealed (R=-0.28; p<0.001). We conclude that histological examination of biopsies taken from one of the series of elicitation sites is a reliable and sensitive method in the evaluation of CHS response after UVR.",Excluded

The study aimed to ascertain the success of Astra-Tech implants in this patient group. Material(s) and Method(s): Patients who were restored with Astra Tech implants after ablative head and neck surgery were evaluated by analyzing serial prospectively accrued data since April 2006. Patient's data who received implants in the mandible were selected to be evaluated regarding implant success and contributing factors. Implant survival was calcula ted by the Kaplan-Meier analysis (Stat-View Version 4.1, Abacus Concepts, Inc.) and Cox models were used to evaluate any association between implant failure and reconstructive or medical treatment modality. Result(s): A total of 136 implants were placed in 33 patients during December 2006 to April 2012. Ten of the subjects were females and 23 were males with a mean age of 65 years. 21 patients received radiotherapy with a cumulative radiation dose between 56 Gray and 76 Gray. In six patients failures were noted resulting in a loss of 17 implants. Cumulative survival rates were 92.7% after 1 year and 87.5% after years two and three. Radiation therapy contributed to 12 of the 17 implant failures (p-value < 0.3). Failures occurred more in the interforam inal than in the posterior region (11-6). Free vascularized bone grafts with two failure fared significantly better than own bone or free bone grafts (p-value < 0.344). Conclusion(s): Astra Tech implant survival is acceptably high in this at risk group of patients and compares more than favorably with comparative studies in the literature. Radiation therapy seems to be associated with implant failure and the contribution of vascular-ized tissue to the survival of implants seems to be significant.",Excluded

3627,"Induction chemotherapy with cisplatin and ifosfamide in locally advanced inoperable squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck: A single-institution experience BACKGROUND: Induction chemotherapy (ICT) in patients with head and neck cancer has been studied since a long time. The addition of taxanes to the cisplatin and 5-fluorouracil (5FU) (PF) regimen results in superior antitumor activity. We did this study to see the response and toxicity of ICT with cisplatin and ifosfamide followed by concurrent chemoradiotherapy (CRT) in locally advanced, unresectable squamous cell carcinoma of head and neck (SCCHN). AIMS: The aim of this study was to see the results of ICT using cisplatin and ifosfamide regimen in locally advanced unresectable SCCHN in terms of acute and chronic toxicity and response to treatment. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Patients with Stage III and IV, nonmetastatic SCCHN were enrolled in the study. They were given two cycles of ICT with cisplatin and ifosfamide followed by CRT. RESULT(S): After ICT, the overall response rate (ORR) was 75.0% at the primary site and 70.0% at the nodal site. ORR for combined primary and nodal disease was observed to be 67.5%. The complete response (CR) and partial response (PR) for combined primary and nodal site were seen in 4 (10.0%) and 23 (57.5%) patients. Of 32 patients who received CRT after ICT, CR was 53.1% and PR was 31.3%. Mucositis, skin reaction, and pharyngeal and laryngeal toxicities were the most common but tolerable. CONCLUSION(S): ICT with cisplatin and ifosfamide gives comparable results to the standard paclitaxel, PF regimen. We conclude that this combination regimen for ICT is not only an economical alternative of taxol-based regimen but also well tolerated by the patients.Copyright © 2017 Indian Journal of Cancer.",Excluded
2559,"Latest-generation catheterization systems enable invasive submillisievert coronary angiography BACKGROUND: The radiation risk of patients undergoing invasive cardiology remains considerable and includes skin injuries and cancer. To date, submillisievert coronary angiography has not been considered feasible., PATIENTS AND METHODS: In 2011, we compared results from 100 consecutive patients undergoing elective coronary angiography using the latest-generation flat-panel angiography system (FPS) with results from examinations by the same operator using 106 historic controls with a conventional image-intensifier system (IIS) that was new in 2002., RESULTS: The median patient exposure parameters were measured as follows: dose-area product (DAP) associated with radiographic cine acquisitions (DAP(R)) and fluoroscopy (DAP(F)) scenes, radiographic frames and runs, and cumulative exposure times for radiography and fluoroscopy. On the FPS as compared to the traditional IIS, radiographic detector entrance dose levels were reduced from 164 to 80 nGy/frame and pulse rates were lowered from 12.5/s to 7.5/s during radiography and from 25/s to 4/s during fluoroscopy. The cardiologist's performance patterns remained comparable over the years: fluoroscopy time was constant and radiography time even slightly increased. Overall patient DAP decreased from 7.0 to 2.4 Gy x cm(2); DAP(R), from 4.2 to 1.7 Gy x cm(2); and DAP(F), from 2.8 to 0.6 Gy x cm(2). Time-adjusted DAP(R)/s decreased from 436 to 130 mGy x cm(2) and DAP(F)/s, from 21.6 to 4.4 mGy x cm(2). Cumulative patient skin dose with the FPS amounted to 67 mGy, and the median (interquartile range) of effective dose was 0.5 (0.3 ... 0.7) mSv., CONCLUSION: Consistent application of radiation-reducing techniques with the latest-generation flat-panel systems enables submillisievert coronary angiography in invasive cardiology.",Excluded

981,"Reducing radiation exposure during invasive coronary angiography and percutaneous coronary interventions implementing a simple four-step protocol Background: With an increasing number of complex and repeated percutaneous coronary interventions (PCI), radiation-induced hazards for patients and operators remain an important issue in fluoroscopy-guided procedures. Our objective was to evaluate radiation exposure during coronary angiographic procedures and assess the efficacy of a four-step program to reduce radiation exposure during coronary angiography (CAG) and PCI. Methods and Results: A retrospective single-center analysis was performed in patients undergoing CAG or PCI in the first 6 months of 2012 vs. the first 6 months of 2014 (n = 3,107 procedures). During 2013, a four-step protocol was established in our hospital. It contained measures to reduce radiation exposure, including a frame rate reduction from 15 to 7.5 frames per second, the use of fluoroscopy storage, strict use of beam collimation, and repeat training on radiation safety. After adjustment for confounding variables, a dose-area product (DAP) reduction of 54.2 % was observed subsequent to implementation of the four-step protocol. Independent predictors of DAP were age [odds ratio (OR) 1.01], body surface area (OR 5.47), prior coronary artery bypass grafting (OR 1.44), radial access (OR 1.16), PCI (OR 2.36), female gender (OR 0.91), and the implementation of the four-step program (OR 0.46). Conclusion(s): A simple four-step protocol led to a significant reduction in radiation exposure in diagnostic and interventional coronary procedures without significant drawbacks in image quality. Hence, radiation safety programs are of paramount importance and should be established to improve patient and operator safety with regard to radiation-induced hazards.Copyright © 2015, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.",Excluded

2354,"Histopathologic Analysis of Lung Cancer Incidence Associated with Radon Exposure among Ontario Uranium Miners Although radon is a well-established contributor to lung cancer mortality among uranium miners, the effects of radon decay products on different histopathologies of lung carcinoma are not well established. Using a retrospective cohort design, this study aims to examine the risks of lung cancer by histological subtypes associated with exposure to radon decay products among the Ontario Uranium Miners cohort. Cases were stratified by histological groups, and associated risks were estimated for cumulative radon exposure after adjustment for attained age and calendar period. Between 1969 and 2005, 1274 incident cases of primary lung cancer were identified. Of these, 1256 diagnoses (99%) contained information on histology. Squamous cell carcinoma was most common (31%), followed by adenocarcinoma (20%), large cells (18%), small cell lung carcinoma (14%), and other or unspecified cell types (17%). Of the histological sub-groups, small cell lung carcinoma had the strongest association with cumulative radon exposure; compared to the reference group (<1 cumulative working level months (WLM)), the highest exposure category (>60 cumulative WLM) had a relative risk (RR) of 2.76 (95% CI: 1.67-4.57). Adenocarcinoma had the lowest risk and was not significantly associated with exposure to radon decay products (RR = 1.49, 95% CI: 0.96-2.31). An increasing, linear trend in relative risk was noted with increasing cumulative WLM across small cell, squamous cell, and large cell lung carcinomas (Ptrend < 0.05). Similarly, the excess relative risk (ERR) per WLM was highest for small cell lung carcinoma (ERR/WLM = 0.15, p < 0.01), followed by squamous cell carcinoma (ERR/WLM = 0.12, p < 0.01). Non-statistically significant excess risk was observed for adenocarcinoma (ERR/WLM = 0.004, p = 0.07). Our analysis of the Ontario Uranium Miners cohort data shows differences in the magnitude of the risks across four histological subtypes of lung carcinoma; the strongest association was noted for small cell lung carcinoma, followed by squamous cell, large cell, and lastly adenocarcinoma, which showed no significant associations with exposure to radon decay products.",Included

The fraction of cancer attributable to lifestyle and environmental factors in the UK in 2010 This chapter summarises the results of the preceding sections, which estimate the fraction of cancers occurring in the UK in 2010 that can be attributed to sub-optimal, past exposures of 14 lifestyle and environmental risk factors. For each of 18 cancer types, we present the percentage of cases attributable to one or all of the risk factors considered (tobacco, alcohol, four elements of diet (consumption of meat, fruit and vegetables, fibre, and salt), overweight, lack of physical exercise, occupation, infections, radiation (ionising and solar), use of hormones, and reproductive history (breast feeding)).Exposure to less than optimum levels of the 14 factors was responsible for 42.7% of cancers in the UK in 2010 (45.3% in men, 40.1% in women)-a total of about 134 000 cases.Tobacco smoking is by far the most important risk factor for cancer in the UK, responsible for 60 000 cases (19.4% of all new cancer cases) in 2010. The relative importance of other exposures differs by sex. In men, deficient intake of fruits and vegetables (6.1%), occupational exposures (4.9%) and alcohol consumption (4.6%) are next in importance, while in women, it is overweight and obesity (because of the effect on breast cancer)-responsible for 6.9% of cancers, followed by infectious agents (3.7%).Population- attributable fractions provide a valuable quantitative appraisal of the impact of different factors in cancer causation, and are thus helpful in prioritising cancer control strategies. However, quantifying the likely impact of preventive interventions requires rather complex scenario modelling, including specification of realistically achievable population distributions of risk factors, and the timescale of change, as well as the latent periods between exposure and outcome, and the rate of change following modification in exposure level. © 2011 Cancer Research UK All rights reserved.",Included

Med. 8 (2002) 955]. Although a plethora of data exist on the effects of high radiation doses, the effects of low-dose irradiation, such as ones received during repetitive diagnostic and therapeutic exposures, are still under-investigated [Am. J. Otolaryngol. 23 (2002) 215; Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 97 (2000) 889; Curr. Opin. Neurol. 16 (2003) 129]. Furthermore, most studies of the biological effects of ionizing radiation have been performed using a single acute dose, while clinically and environmentally relevant exposures occur predominantly under chronic/repetitive conditions. Here, we have used a mouse model to compare the effects of chronic/repetitive and acute low-dose radiation (LDR) exposure (0.5Gy) to ionizing radiation on the brain in vivo. We examined the LDR effects on p42/44 MAPK (ERK1/ERK2), CaMKII, and AKT signaling-the interconnected pathways that have been previously shown to be crucial for neuronal survival upon irradiation. We report perturbations in ERK1/2, AKT, and CREB upon acute and chronic/repetitive low-dose exposure in the hippocampus and frontal cortex of mice. These studies were paralleled by the analysis of radiation effects on neurogenesis and cellular proliferation. Repetitive exposure had a much more pronounced effect on cellular signaling and neurogenesis than acute exposure. These results suggest that studies of single acute exposures might be limited in terms of their predictive value. We also present the first evidence of sex differences in radiation-induced signaling in the hippocampus and frontal cortex. We show the role of estrogens in brain radiation responses and discuss the implications of the observed changes.",Included
162,"Nonlinear interactions of high-frequency oscillations in the human somatosensory system OBJECTIVE: The source of somatosensory evoked high-frequency activity at about 600 Hz is still not completely clear. Hence, we aimed to study the influence of double stimulation on the human somatosensory system by analyzing both the low-frequency activity and the high-frequency oscillations (HFOs) at about 600 Hz., METHODS: We used median nerve stimulation at seven interstimuli intervals (ISIs) with a high time resolution between 2.4 and 4.8 ms to investigate the N15, N20 and superimposed HFOs. Simultaneously, the electroencephalogram and the magnetoencephalogram of 12 healthy participants were recorded. Subsequently, the source analysis of precortical and cortical dipoles was performed., RESULTS: The difference computations of precortical dipole activation curves showed in both the low- and high-frequency range a correlation between the ISI and the latency of the second stimulus response. The cortical low-frequency response showed a similar behavior. Contrarily, in the second response of cortical HFOs this latency shift could not be confirmed. We found amplitude fluctuations that were dependent on the ISI in the low-frequency activity and the HFOs. These nonlinear interactions occurred at ISIs, which differ by one full HFO period (1.6 ms)., CONCLUSIONS: Low-frequency activity and HFOs originate from different generators. Precortical and cortical HFOs are independently generated. The amplitude fluctuations dependent on ISI indicate nonlinear interference between successive stimuli., SIGNIFICANCE: Information processing in human somatosensory system includes nonlinearity.",Excluded

OBJECTIVES: To assess whether routine postoperative chest radiography (CXR) is required after open nephrectomy for the detection and possible management of a pneumothorax. It has become the standard of care by many urologists to obtain routine postoperative CXRs after open nephrectomy to assess for the presence of a pneumothorax. However, at our institution, very few patients have developed a pneumothorax postoperatively, and, furthermore, the CXR findings almost never affected the clinical management., METHODS: Retrospective data were collected on the last 150 open nephrectomies performed by two urologists at our institution. All laparoscopic nephrectomies and thoracoabdominal nephrectomies were excluded from analysis., RESULTS: A total of 150 patients underwent open nephrectomy between 1998 and 2003. The procedure was performed with an anterior subcostal, 11th rib, 12th rib, midline, and 10th rib incision in 60 (40%), 51 (34%), 18 (12%), 20 (13.3%), and 1 (0.67%) patient, respectively. Of the 150 patients, 92 (61.3%) underwent postoperative CXR and 58 (38.7%) did not. Of the 150 patients, 92 of whom had undergone postoperative CXR, 4 (2.7%) had a postoperative pneumothorax. One of these patients (0.67%) received a chest tube. Of the 4 patients with a pneumothorax, 3 had had a recognized pleural tear that was repaired at nephrectomy and the fourth had had an unrecognized pleural injury., CONCLUSIONS: Routine postoperative CXRs are not needed after open nephrectomy. Obtaining a selective CXR when a recognized intraoperative pleural tear has occurred, a central line is placed, the physical examination reveals an abnormality (ie, decreased breath sounds), or the patient experiences respiratory difficulties in the postoperative period is safe, cost-effective, and decreases the radiation exposure to patients.",Excluded

184,"Irradiation as a quarantine treatment for the solenopsis mealybug, Phenacoccus solenopsis Phenacoccus solenopsis is an aggressively invasive species that targets agricultural and ornamental plants, thereby threatening the world cotton industry and other crops. P. solenopsis has been listed as a quarantine insect in Europe and China. The utilization of phytosanitary irradiation as a potential treatment for disinfesting agricultural commodities in trade has expanded rapidly in recent years. A reasonable dose of radiation to eliminate P. solenopsis needs to be determined, taking into account the side effects of radiation on agricultural products and the species-specific tolerance of the insect to radiation. We applied radiation ranging from 50 to 200. Gy to P. solenopsis to determine the optimal dose. Both the radiation dose and the developmental stage of the insect were independent variables. Higher doses of radiation or lesser mature insect stages provided more effective treatment. In nymphs, a radiation dose of 100. Gy caused extinction of the irradiated population by disrupting ovary development, while 150. Gy caused 100% mortality. In adults, all tested doses of irradiation did not affect longevity, but we were able to prevent reproduction with high (150 and 200. Gy) doses. In P. solenopsis, a 100. Gy dose of radiation could eliminate the irradiated population in two generations. The mortality curve showed a steep slope beyond 150. Gy; thus, if killing all of the insects in a shorter amount of time is necessary, 200.

As such, BCG could be used to boost host immunity but not in immunocompromised hosts, as it is a live, attenuated vaccine. Therefore, we assessed whether killed gammaBCG has similar potentiating effects. In an in vitro model of trained immunity, human monocytes were incubated with gammaBCG for 24 h and restimulated after 6 d. Cytokine production and the role of pattern recognition receptors and histone methylation markers were assessed. The in vivo effects of gammaBCG vaccination were studied in a proof-of-principle trial in 15 healthy volunteers. gammaBCG induced trained immunity in vitro via the NOD2 receptor pathway and up-regulation of H3K4me3 histone methylation. However, these effects were less strong than those induced by live BCG. gammaBCG vaccination in volunteers had only minimal effects on innate immunity, whereas a significant increase in heterologous Th1/Th17 immunity was observed. Our results indicate that gammaBCG induces long-term training of innate immunity in vitro. In vivo, gammaBCG induces mainly heterologous effects on the adaptive-immune system, whereas effects on innate cytokine production are limited. Copyright © Society for Leukocyte Biology.""",Excluded

2358,"177Lu-DOTATATE PRRT in patients with metastatic neuroendocrine tumor and a single functioning kidney: Tolerability and effect on renal function Our objective was to assess the renal toxicity profile of 177Lu- DOTATATE peptide receptor radionuclide therapy (PRRT) in patients with a metastatic neuroendocrine tumor (NET) and a single functioning kidney. Method(s): This was a retrospective analysis of NET patients who had undergone 177Lu-DOTATATE PRRT at a large tertiary-care center. All patients selected for the study had somatostatin receptor-positive NETs, had received at least 3 cycles of 177Lu-DOTATATE PRRT, and had a documented single functioning kidney. The analyzed parameters included patient characteristics, metastatic burden, renal characteristics at diagnosis and during therapy, and nephrotoxic factors. For the renal assessment, the following characteristics were studied before each PRRT cycle: glomerular filtration rate (GFR) as estimated by 99mTcdiethylenetriamine pentaacetic acid renography, effective renal plasma flow (ERPF) as measured by 99mTc-ethylenedicysteine renography, and blood urea and serum creatinine levels. Renal toxicity was evaluated using version 4.0 of the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI-CTCAE score). The percentage reduction in GFR and ERPF was also assessed. Filtration fraction was calculated to clarify whether there was a relatively greater reduction in one index of renal function than in the other. Result(s): At the time of analysis, 6 patients met the inclusion criteria, having received between 3 and 5 cycles of therapy with a cumulative activity of 16.6-36.2 GBq. The duration of follow-up ranged from 12 to 56 mo. The overall toxicity profile (as per the NCI-CTCAE score) showed no acute renal toxicity in any patient. Regarding overall chronic renal toxicity, 3 patients had none, 1 patient had grade II, and 2 patients had grade I. All patients with overall chronic renal toxicity showed compromised renal function at the outset (baseline). The 2 patients with grade I chronic renal toxicity after PRRT had grade II at baseline and gradual improvement over the subsequent cycles. One patient with grade II at baseline showed transient worsening to grade III after the first cycle followed by gradual improvement and a return to baseline after the second cycle. Only 2 patients showed a reduction in GFR (5.3% in one and 13.84% in the other). Four patients showed a reduction in ERPF (31.4% in the patient with the greatest reduction), and all had a rise in filtration fraction signifying that tubular parameters were more affected than glomerular parameters. Conclusion(s): With proper renal protection and dose fractionation, it is feasible to use 177Lu-DOTATATE PRRT in patients with NET and a single functioning kidney. Further studies are required to assess the long-term renal consequences of changes in ERPF and filtration fraction in these patients.Copyright © 2016 by the Society of Nuclear Medicine and Molecular Imaging, Inc.",Excluded
957,"A prospective quality of life study of patients with oral or pharyngeal carcinoma treated with external beam irradiation with or without brachytherapy The aim of this longitudinal quality of life (QL) study, was to study tumour-related symptoms and treatment side-effects of patients with oral or oropharyngeal cancer and to determine whether an increased local dose of irradiation (brachytherapy affected QL. The European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Core Questionnaire (EORTC QLQ-C30), a tumour-specific Head and Neck questionnaire and the Hospital Anxiety and Depression scale (HAD) were used repeatedly during 1 year. There were 105 patients, with a cumulative response rate of 89%. Most symptoms and problems were at their peak 2 or 3 months after the start of treatment. Nutrition and pain were found to be the major problems, and as many as 19-40% reported psychiatric distress. Patients having received additional brachytherapy did not report any increase in QL problems (except for pain) compared with those having had external radiation only. Quality of life does not seem to be affected by the increased irradiation local dose given when brachytherapy is included in the treatment regimen.",Included
3510,"Single-nucleotide polymorphisms of TGFbeta1 and ATM associated with radiation-induced pneumonitis: A prospective cohort study of thoracic cancer patients in China Background: We examined the effects of the rs1800469 and rs1800470 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of the transforming growth factor-beta1 (TGFbeta1) gene and the rs189037 and rs373759 SNPs of the ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM) gene on the risk of radiation-induced pneumonitis (RP) in patients who underwent radiotherapy for various thoracic malignancies. Method(s): We determined the genotype and allele distributions of rs1800469 (C-509T), rs1800470 (C869T), rs189037 (A-111G), and rs373759 (126713 G>A) in 141 Han Chinese patients who underwent definitive thoracic radiotherapy (50 to 77 Gy, 5 days/wk) for lung cancer (small cell or non-small cell tumors, n = 97), esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC, n = 27), or mediastinal cancer (n = 17). Clinical variables were evaluated using multivariate logistic regression models to calculate the relative risk of RP associated with the clinical variables, and a Pearson correlation analysis was used to evaluate the relationship between the SNP genotypes and alleles and the incidence of RP for the various risk factors. Result(s): The T alleles of rs1800470 (CT/TT) and rs1800469 (CT/TT) and the G allele of rs189037 (GA/GG) were associated with the risk of >= grade-2 RP in the ESCC patients (P = 0.0006, P = 0.0127, and P = 0.0412, respectively), and that the A alleles of rs189037 (AG/AA) and rs373759 (AG/AA) were associated with the risk of >= grade-2 RP in the patients with mediastinal cancer (P = 0.0063 and P = 0.0003, respectively). None of the SNP genotypes were associated with the risk of RP in lung cancer patients. Conclusion(s): The T alleles of the rs1800470 (CT/TT) and rs1800469 (CT/TT) SNPs of TGFbeta1 and the G allele of the rs189037 (GA/GG) SNP of ATM are independent risk factors for RP in Chinese ESCC patients, and the A alleles of the rs189037 (AG/AA) and rs373759 (AG/AA) SNPs of ATM are independent risk factors for RP in Chinese patients with mediastinal cancer. These SNPs might represent useful biomarkers for personalizing radiotherapy regimens for Chinese patients with ESCC or mediastinal cancer to reduce the incidence of RP. Large-cohort studies of these SNPs in thoracic cancer patients are warranted.Copyright © 2015, E-Century Publishing Corporation. All rights reserved.",Excluded
639,"Is treatment of hemorrhagic radiation cystitis with hyperbaric oxygen effective? Objective: We report our own experience with the use of hyperbaric oxygen (HBO) for the management of postradiation hemorrhagic cystitis. Method(s): We reviewed retrospectively 14 patients from 2001 to 2007 with different pelvic organ malignancies who developed radiation cystitis after irradiation. Patients received 100% oxygen in a hyperbaric chamber at a pressure of 2.5 atmospheres absolute, 60 min bottom time, once a day, 7 days a week for at least 1 month. In principle, 30 HBO treatments per course were performed. After every course of HBO treatments, therapeutic effect was evaluated. The mean duration of follow-up of all patients was 18 months (range: 1-6 years). Result(s): Patients were divided into 2 groups, group 1 (treatment group, n = 10) and group 2 (without treatment, n = 4). The mean duration between the onset of hematuria and the beginning of HBO therapy was 8.9 months (range: 3-34). Group 2 did not receive HBO because they were not healthy enough. Only 2 patients (20%) of group 1 recovered from their hemorrhagic cystitis. Group 1 had a significantly lower cure rate of postirradiation hemorrhagic cystitis in comparison to group 2. Conclusion(s): Our experience with the use of HBO did not yield favorable results. Randomized well-controlled studies are needed. © 2010 S. Karger AG, Basel.",Excluded
1665,"[Study of nitroblue tetrazolium reduction by granulocytes in workers handling x-ray equipment] In 44 persons (25 women and 15 men), workers handling X-ray equipment in X-ray laboratories the ability was studied of nitroblue tetrazolium (NBT) reduction by neutrophils. The obtained results were compared with a control group. Besides that subgroups were isolated taking into account the sex of the studied subjects and duration of their work with X-ray equipment (over five years and below five years). In the workers handling X-ray equipment and in the isolated subgroups of women and men, the index of spontaneous NBT reduction turned out to be statistically significantly higher than that in the control group. In the group of studied workers the index of latex-stimulated NBT reduction was statistically significantly lower than that in the control group. Taking into account the duration of work with X-ray equipment in the subgroups of women and men working for over five years, the lowest index of phagocytes was noted. On the basis of the obtained results the following conclusions were formulated: 1. In workers handling X-ray equipment disturbances occur of peripheral blood neutrophil metabolism assessed in the NBT test. 2.

2589,"Minimally invasive radioguided parathyroidectomy We reported here the data on minimally invasive radioguided parathyroidectomy (MIRP) in a large group of 253 patients enrolled from the whole series of 355 consecutive patients affected by primary hyperparathyroidism (P-HPT) referred to our center. On the basis of preoperative imaging including Sestamibi scintigraphy and neck ultrasound (US), 263 patients (74% of the whole series) with evidence of a solitary parathyroid adenoma (PA) and a normal thyroid gland were addressed to MIRP and in 253 (96%) of them this minimally invasive neck exploration was successfully performed. The MIRP protocol developed in our center consisted of a very low 1 mCi Sestamibi injection in the operating room a few minutes before the start of intervention, thus minimizing the radiation exposure dose to the patient and personnel. No major intraoperative complication was recorded in patients treated by MIRP and only a transient hypocalcemia in 8.5% of cases. The mean duration time for MIRP was 35 min and the mean hospital stay 1.2 days. Local anesthesia was also performed in 62 patients, 54 of whom were elderly patients with concomitant invalidating diseases contraindicating general anesthesia. No HPT relapse was observed during subsequent follow-up. The gamma probe was used also during bilateral neck exploration in the group of 92 patients excluded from MIRP. The most frequent cause of exclusion from MIRP in our series was the presence of concomitant Sestamibi avid thyroid nodules (68.5% of cases) that can give false positive results at radioguided surgery. In conclusion, MIRP is an effective treatment in patients with a high likelihood of a solitary PA and a normal thyroid gland at scintigraphy and US so that an accurate preoperative localizing imaging is required for MIRP. A low 1 mCi Sestamibi dose appears sufficient to perform MIRP. Patients with concomitant Sestamibi avid thyroid nodules should be excluded from MIRP. © 2006 Elsevier SAS.

726,"Photochemical repair of Achilles tendon rupture in a rat model Background. Photochemical tissue bonding (PTB) is an emerging technique for bonding or sealing tissue surfaces that requires light and a photoactive dye for its effect. The potential of PTB for tendon repair was assessed in a rat model. Materials and methods. The optical properties of bovine tendon were determined ex vivo to gauge the depth of light penetration as a function of wavelength and dosimetry parameters were established for PTB repair of ruptured tendon. PTB was then tested in vivo to repair transected tendons in Sprague-Dawley rats. Repair strengths were measured using a strain gauge up to 14 days post treatment. Results. The effective penetration depth in tendon was estimated to be 0.68 mm at 514 nm. Following PTB treatment of mechanically ruptured tendon, significant bonding was dependent on the presence of both light and dye and attained a plateau strength at a fluence of 125 J/cm2. In a subsequent in vivo study to investigate PTB for repair of transected rat Achilles tendon, the ultimate stress required to break the repaired tendon was measured immediately after irradiation and at 7 and 14 days post-repair. Results showed that the difference in the ultimate stress between control and PTB treatment groups was statistically significant immediately after treatment and at 7 days (p = 0.04) but not 14 days (p = 0.75) post-repair. Conclusions. PTB provides a benefit to tendon repair at early stages in repair and is worthy of further investigation as a potential surgical adjunct for tendon repair in orthopedic surgeries. © 2005 Elsevier Inc.

2309,"Protein expression of nucleophosmin, annexin A3 and nm23-H1 correlates with human nasopharyngeal carcinoma radioresistance in vivo Radioresistance is a significant obstacle in the treatment of endemic nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC). The present study aimed to identify proteins associated with radioresistance in NPC in vitro and in vivo. Proteomics analyses were conducted to screen for differentially-expressed proteins (DEPs) in parental CNE-2 cells and CNE-2R cells. Using proteomics approaches, 16 DEPs were identified. Of these DEPs, nucleophosmin (NPM1), annexin A3 and nm23-H1, were verified using western blot analyses. The tumorigenicity was investigated using mouse xenograft tumorigenicity assays, and tumor growth curves were generated. The protein expression of NPM1, annexin A3 and nm23-H1 was examined by immunohistochemically staining tumor tissues. NPM1 and annexin A3 protein levels were downregulated in the CNE-2R cells, whereas nm23-H1 expression was upregulated. In vivo tests showed that compared with the CNE-2 tumors, CNE-2R tumor growth was significantly retarded (P<0.05). CNE-2 tumor progression was inhibited by irradiation, but CNE-2R tumor progression was not, indicating that the CNE-2R cells were also radioresistant in vivo. NPM1 and annexin A3 expression was significantly lower in non-irradiated (NIR)-CNE-2R tumors compared with NIR-CNE-2 tumors (P<0.01). However, Nm23-H1 protein levels were significantly higher (P<0.05). Overall, the present study established comparable radioresistant and radiosensitive tumor models of human NPC, and identified candidate biomarkers that may correlate with radioresistance. The data showed that dysregulation of NPM1, annexin A3 and nm23-H1 expression correlated with the cellular and tumor radioresponse. These proteins are involved in the regulation of intracellular functions, including stress responses, cell proliferation and DNA repair. However, further clinical evaluations are required.Copyright © 2016, Spandidos Publications. All rights reserved.",Included
3685,"Less efficient g2-m checkpoint is associated with an increased risk of lung cancer in African Americans Cell cycle checkpoints play critical roles in the maintenance of genomic integrity. The inactivation of checkpoint genes by genetic and epigenetic mechanisms is frequent in all cancer types, as a less-efficient cell cycle control can lead to genetic instability and tumorigenesis. In an on-going case-control study consisting of 216 patients with non-small cell lung cancer, 226 population-based controls, and 114 hospital-based controls, we investigated the relationship of gamma-radiation-induced G2-M arrest and lung cancer risk. Peripheral blood lymphocytes were cultured for 90 hours, exposed to 1.0 Gy gamma-radiation, and harvested at 3 hours after gamma-radiation treatment. gamma-Radiation-induced G2-M arrest was measured as the percentage of mitotic cells in untreated cultures minus the percentage of mitotic cells in gamma-radiation-treated cultures from the same subject. The mean percentage of gamma-radiation-induced G2-M arrest was significantly lower in cases than in population controls (1.18 versus 1.44, P < 0.01) and hospital controls (1.18 versus 1.40, P = 0.01). When dichotomized at the 50th percentile value in combined controls (population and hospital controls), a lower level of gamma-radiation-induced G2-M arrest was associated with an increased risk of lung cancer among African Americans after adjusting for baseline mitotic index, age, gender, and pack-years of smoking [adjusted odd ratio (OR), 2.25; 95% confidence interval (95% CI), 0.97-5.20]. A significant trend of an increased risk of lung cancer with a decreased level of G2-M arrest was observed (P(trend) = 0.02) among African Americans, with a lowest-versus-highest quartile adjusted OR of 3.74 (95% CI, 0.98-14.3). This trend was most apparent among African American females (P(trend) < 0.01), with a lowest-versus-highest quartile adjusted OR of 11.75 (95% CI, 1.47-94.04). The results suggest that a less-efficient DNA damage-induced G2-M checkpoint is associated with an increased risk of lung cancer among African Americans. Interestingly, we observed a stronger association of DNA damage-induced G2-M arrest and lung cancer among African Americans when compared with Caucasians. If replicated, these results may provide clues to the exceedingly high lung cancer incidence experienced by African Americans.",Included

2958,"Chromatic organization of ganglion cell receptive fields in the peripheral retina This study addresses the chromatic properties of receptive fields in the subcortical visual pathway of primates. There is agreement that, in the central visual field, many cells belonging to the parvocellular (PC) division of the subcortical pathway show red-green opponent responses, that a subgroup of cells belonging to the koniocellular (KC) pathway shows blue-yellow opponent responses, and that magnocellular (MC) pathway cells show only weak signs of chromatic input. However, the chromatic properties of ganglion cells in the peripheral retina are poorly understood. Here, we measured the temporal-chromatic properties of ganglion cells in extracellular in vivo recordings from peripheral macaque retina. We show that the chromatic responsivity of peripheral KC (""blue-on"") and MC cells is very similar to that of their counterparts in the foveal retina. Cone-opponent responses are expressed only at low temporal frequencies (<10 Hz) in the majority of peripheral PC cells, and some peripheral PC cells show non-opponent response properties. With these exceptions, the chromatic properties of ganglion cells are essentially preserved throughout the first 50 degrees of visual eccentricity. The main change seen in passing from foveal to peripheral retina is that all ganglion cell classes become more responsive to high temporal-frequency modulation.",Excluded
2157,"PET/MRI for staging patients with Hodgkin lymphoma: equivalent results with PET/CT in a prospective trial To compare FDG-PET/unenhanced MRI and FDG-PET/diagnostic CT in detecting infiltration in patients with newly diagnosed Hodgkin lymphoma (HL). The endpoint was equivalence between PET/MRI and PET/CT in correctly defining the revised Ann Arbor staging system. Seventy consecutive patients with classical-HL were prospectively investigated for nodal and extra-nodal involvement during pretreatment staging with same-day PET/CT and PET/MRI. Findings indicative of malignancy with the imaging procedures were regarded as lymphoma infiltration; in case of discrepancy, positive-biopsy and/or response to treatment were evidenced as lymphoma. Sixty of the 70 (86%) patients were evaluable having completed the staging program. Disease staging based on either PET/MRI or PET/CT was correct for 54 of the 60 patients (90% vs. 90%), with difference between proportions of 0.0 (95% CI, -9 to 9%; P=0.034 for the equivalence test).

669,"Helicobacter gastritis induces changes in the oxyntic mucosa indistinguishable from the effects of proton pump inhibitors A causal relationship between oxyntic glands dilatation with protruding parietal cells, referred to as proton pump inhibitor (PPI) effects, and PPI use has been suspected but not established. We designed this study to evaluate the association between these changes and the use of PPIs and histamine 2-receptor blockers (H2-blockers). We obtained five Sydney System-compliant biopsy specimens from patients recruited into a therapeutic trial for H. pylori. Medication history with details on PPI and H 2-blockers use was collected. Two blinded pathologists graded gastritis and the intensity of putative PPI effects using a 0 to 3 scale. PPI and H2-blocker use was then disclosed and the accuracy of pathologists' assessment was analyzed. There were 138 H. pylori-negative and 104 positive patients. In H. pylori-negative patients the histologic assessment for PPI use had 77.5% sensitivity and 51.8% specificity, with a positive predictive value of 86.9% and a negative predictive value of 35.9%. In H. pylori-positive patients, sensitivity was 74.1% and specificity 26.1%. Positive and negative predictive values were 55.8% and 44.4%, respectively. Neither glandular dilatations nor parietal cell protrusions related to H2-blocker use. We conclude that these changes are associated with PPI use only in H. pylori-negative subjects. In H. pylori gastritis, so-called PPI-effects were equally prevalent in PPI-users and non-users, indicating that other factors are involved in the induction of oxyntic cell hyperplasia. We suggest that comments regarding the supposed evidence of PPI use are too often wrong to be useful and should be avoided in the diagnosis of gastric biopsy specimens. © 2013 Elsevier Inc.

3299,"Estimation of dose in cancer patients treated with fractionated radiotherapy using translocation, dicentrics and micronuclei frequency in peripheral blood lymphocytes The frequency of translocation, dicentrics (DC) and micronuclei (MN) was studied in blood samples exposed in vitro to 60Co gamma radiation and cervical cancer patients undergoing fractionated radiotherapy. The samples exposed under in vitro condition showed that the frequency of translocation and dicentric followed Poisson distribution ('u' varied between -0.04 and +1.41 for translocation and between -0.09 and +1.81 for DC) and that obtained with MN follow over dispersion ('u' varied between +2.04 and +9.28).

The frequencies of aberrations obtained in cancer patients were found to be lower than those obtained for in vitro exposure for doses more than 2 Gy equivalent whole body dose (EWBD). The dose-response curves were constructed using the frequencies of DC, MN and translocation as a function of EWBD. Doses as measured from the dose response curves were compared with the estimated dose in order to check whether the measured and estimated doses agree.

1506,"Delivered dose and vascular response after beta-radiation for in-stent restenosis: retrospective dosimetry and volumetric intravascular ultrasound analysis BACKGROUND: Observations from previous intracoronary radiation therapy trials noted a considerable discrepancy between the prescribed radiation dose and the dose actually delivered. The aims of this study were to investigate the effect of actual delivered dose on vascular changes and to test the appropriateness of the current dose prescription., METHODS AND RESULTS: Serial volumetric intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) analysis was performed in 30 in-stent restenosis cases treated with a 40-mm (90)Sr/Y source train. The fixed dose was prescribed at 2 mm from the centerline of the source train (18.4 Gy at 2 mm for reference diameter or =3.36 mm). Only stent segments with full radiation coverage and device injury were enrolled and divided into 2-mm-long subsegments (n=202). D(S90)EEM (the minimum dose absorbed by 90% of the external elastic membrane surface) was calculated as the delivered dose corresponding to each segment, assuming that the radiation catheter occupied the same position in the vessel as the IVUS catheter. Mean D(S90)EEM of 23.5+/-5.82 Gy (range 12.3 to 41.7 Gy) was delivered to these subsegments. Overall, intimal hyperplasia volume remained constant from postintervention to follow-up (2.23+/-1.10 to 2.32+/-1.09 mm3/m; P=NS). Regression analysis revealed there was no correlation between delivered dose intensity and changes in intimal hyperplasia volume. No particular dose-dependent complications were appreciated in this delivered dose range., CONCLUSIONS: The current dose-prescription protocol of (90)Sr/Y radiation to native in-stent restenosis lesions may provide substantial inhibition of neointimal reproliferation regardless of the actual delivered dose intensity.",Excluded
228,"Adaptation to motion sickness from torso rotation affects symptoms from supine head nodding INTRODUCTION: Space motion sickness affects more than 50% of astronauts. Adaptation to one kind of nauseogenic motion can affect the response to another. We hypothesized that repeated exposure to torso rotation (TR) would diminish motion sickness (MS) due to supine head nodding (HN), a ground-based analogue for space sickness., METHODS: During TR, standing subjects swept their gaze back and forth between two targets located 135 degrees to either side of straight ahead. For HN, the subject lay supine on a platform with his/her head and neck hanging over the edge. The head was pitched back and forth between the horizontal position and rotated back as far as possible. MS was quantified in 5 male and 20 female subjects using numerical estimates of discomfort and a more detailed questionnaire. Susceptibility to TR and HN was determined on three occasions for each stimulus. At least 1 mo separated any two tests. Subjects were exposed to TR once a day for 7 consecutive days 1 mo after the final control session. Within 24 h of the seventh session, and 1 mo later, susceptibility to HN was evaluated again., RESULTS: There was a significant decrease in MS susceptibility during repeated exposure to TR (time to stop 17.7 min on Day 1, 31.8 min on Day 7). In contrast, there was a significant increase in MS susceptibility to HN after repeated exposure to TR (mean time to stop 11.7 min before TR, 9.5 min after). Susceptibility to HN was back to normal (time to stop 11.4 min) 1 mo later., DISCUSSION: Subjects can adapt to TR by repeated exposure. At the same time, susceptibility to HN increases. Strategies for pre-adaptation to space motion sickness need to be chosen carefully as they could actually be counterproductive.",Excluded
2262,"Chemoradiotherapy versus radiotherapy alone following induction chemotherapy for elderly patients with stage iii lung cancer Purpose: It is unclear whether adding concurrent chemotherapy (CT) to definitive radiotherapy (RT) following induction CT is a tolerable and cost effective treatment for non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients aged 70 years or older with comorbidities. This study evaluated the actual clinical outcomes between concurrent chemoradiotherapy (CCRT) and RT alone following induction CT or not in patients (>=70 years) in a single institution's clinical practice. Material(s) and Method(s): A total of 82 patients with unresectable stage III NSCLC between 2004 and 2016 were retrospectively analyzed. Their treatment tolerance and clinical outcomes such as overall survival (OS), locoregional recurrence (LRR), treatment toxicities and distant metastasis (DM) were evaluated. Early mortality rates were also evaluated as 4-month mortality after RT. Result(s): Fifty-four patients received CCRT and 28 patients received RT alone. Induction CT before RT was performed for 68.5% and 50.0% in CCRT and RT alone groups. Treatment tolerance was significantly worse in CCRT (p = 0.046). The median survival was 21.1 and 18.1 months for CCRT and RT alone, which was not statistically significant. LRR and DM were also not different. Most early deaths after CCRT were attributed to non-cancer-related mortality. Acute esophagitis of grade >=2 occurred more following CCRT (p = 0.017). In multivariate analysis, a Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI) of >=5 and a weight loss of >=5% after RT were associated with poor OS. The factors adversely affecting 4-month survival were a CCI of >=5 and CCRT. Conclusion(s): There were no significant differences in OS, LRR, and DM between CCRT and RT alone treatment in elderly patients.

Specifically, when the patients had a CCI of >=5, RT alone seems to be reasonable with a low probability of early death.Copyright © 2019. The Korean Society for Radiation Oncology.",Excluded
756,"Proton radiobiology and uncertainties This paper briefly reviews proton radiobiology. Clinical applications of protons produced by accelerators have led to a significant biological literature that contributes to our goal of estimating the proton shielding requirements for human interplanetary missions. Protons are primarily a low-LET radiation with biological effects much like gamma radiation. There are however data indicating enhanced biological effectiveness for small doses of very low energy (<10 MeV) stopping protons, and some limited data for extremely high energy protons (>0.5 GeV).",Excluded
2697,"Osteosarcoma of the flat bone Objective: We aimed to understand the biology of osteosarcoma of the flat bone, which is a rare tumor entity. Method(s): Cases with osteosarcoma of the flat bone were compared with those of the extremity in order to evaluate their clinicopathologic characteristics. And the influences of heterogeneous treatment modalities on outcome were analyzed. Result(s): Tumors of the flat bone comprised 91 (11.3%) of 806 osteosarcoma cases. Eight cases were secondary osteosarcoma associated with previous radiotherapy. Patients with a flat bone tumor were significantly older and more likely to present with metastases at diagnosis than extremity tumor. The proportions of female sex and chondroblastic subtype were higher among flat bone tumors than among extremity tumors. The 5-year overall survival and event-free survival rates were 35.2 +/- 5.4% and 24.7 +/- 5.5%, respectively. Although age and histologic response to pre-operative chemotherapy were not related to outcome of flat bone tumors, treatment modality influenced the survival. Patients treated surgically had better outcomes than those treated by another means. Radiation therapy did not appear to be an effective local control measure as surgery. Conclusion(s): Treatment outcome of the tumor of the flat bone was worse than extremity tumors. Further studies are needed to identify effective local control measures that can substitute for surgery and to determine the biologic characteristics of osteosarcoma of the flat bone. © The Author (2009).

402,"Underprediction of visibly complex chromosome aberrations by a recombinational-repair ('one-hit') model Purpose: Published low-LET FISH data were used to test two models of chromosome aberration production based on breakage-and-reunion or recombinational repair. Material(s) and Method(s): Randomness of DNA double strand break induction and misrejoining is analyzed comprehensively and adopted as a working hypothesis. Proximity effects are approximated by using interaction sites. Model results are calculated using CAS (chromosome aberration simulator) Monte Carlo computer software with two adjustable parameters. CAS can emulate the specifics of any experimental painting protocol, allowing very detailed tests of the models. Result(s): To reasonable approximation, breakage-and-reunion model predictions are consistent with low-LET FISH results, including two large, elaborate, one-paint data sets. An explicitly specified version of the recombinational-repair model severely underpredicts the frequency of the visibly complex aberration patterns most commonly observed with one-paint FISH, and is inconsistent with some observed multi-paint patterns. When high-dose effects (distortion and saturation) are taken into account quantitatively, a dose-response relation for apparently simple interchanges slightly favours the breakage-and-reunion model over the recombinational-repair model, despite being approximately linear over the dose range 2-6 Gy. Conclusion(s): The random breakage-and-reunion model gives comprehensive baseline predictions that are sufficiently accurate for the organization of experimental results. The data speak against complex aberrations being formed by the random recombinational repair pathway discussed here.",Excluded
276,"Treatment of locally advanced, high-grade, malignant tumors of major salivary glands A retrospective review of 45 patients with Stage III and IV malignant tumors of the major salivary glands was undertaken to determine tumor control and patient survival after treatment with surgery and conventional ionizing-radiation therapy. Eight of the 23 patients received early postoperative radiotherapy after initial surgical resection, with a local control rate of 75%. Twelve of 23 patients had surgery as definitive treatment and the tumor recurred locally in all; seven of these 12 patients were subsequently salvaged by further surgery plus postoperative radiotherapy or by radiotherapy alone, with 58% ultimate local control. The remaining three patients had unresectable tumors at diagnosis and received radiation alone, with a local tumor control rate of 33%. Patients were also analyzed according to the extent of surgical resection prior to radiation therapy and according to radiation dose. Eighty-eight percent of completely resected, 50% of partially resected, and 44% of unresected tumors were locally controlled for an overall local control rate of 61%. The 5-year survival rate was significantly higher for patients with local tumor control than for patients who failed locally (31% vs. 0%).",Excluded
1635,"Elective nodal irradiation with simultaneous integrated boost stereotactic body radiation therapy for pancreatic cancer Purpose/Objective(s): Stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) is increasingly being used for pancreatic cancer, even in the neoadjuvant setting for borderline resectable diseases. However, data from RTOG 9704 highlights the importance of elective coverage in resected pancreatic cancer. We evaluate the dose coverage of the elective nodal CTV in the standard tumor only SBRT plans and in alternative dose painting SBRT strategy to cover some nodal volume. Materials/Methods: The standard SBRT plans and the simultaneous integrated boost (SIB)-SBRT plans were retrospectively generated for each of 10 different patients with unresectable pancreatic cancer. Both plans used IMRT technique and seven to nine non-coplanar 6-10 MV photon beams to deliver 33 Gy in 5 fractions to GTV and PTV1. In SIB-SBRT plans, 25 Gy in 5 fractions was simultaneously prescribed to the elective nodal CTV and PTV2. The elective nodal regions of peri-pancreas, retropancreas, porta-hepatis, and para-aorta were included in CTV depending on the primary tumor location in pancreas. Dose constraints for organs-atrisk (OARs) were referred to the previous multi-institutional SBRT trial. The constraints to luminal OARs, namely stomach, duodenum, and small bowel, were regarded as the hard constraints; D9cc, D3cc, and D1cc of each luminal organ should be less than 15 Gy, 20 Gy, and 33 Gy, respectively. The dose reduction in the target for proximal part from the luminal OARs was allowed to meet the hard constraints. The target coverages and OAR doses were analyzed and compared. Result(s): The tumor was located in the head in 7, the body in 2, and the tail in 1 cases. The mean (range) size of GTV and CTV were 50.4 mL (5.2e106 mL) and 320 mL (93.7e453 mL), respectively. The mean of minimum distances to the closest luminal organs were 2.0 mm (0e13.2 mm). The mean +/- SDs of D95 of GTV in standard SBRT vs. SIB-SBRT plans were 96.6 +/- 7.4% vs. 95.8 +/- 7.6%, respectively (P = 0.40). Whereas, D95 of CTV were 4.4 +/- 5.9 Gy vs. 19.9 +/- 5.3 Gy (P < 0.001), respectively. The OAR doses were significantly higher with SIB-SBRT plans in D9cc of stomach, D1cce9cc of duodenum, and D1cce9cc of small bowel. However, no plans violated the hard constraints with SIBSBRT strategy. Conclusion(s): SIB-SBRT strategy was dosimetrically feasible for covering the elective nodal volume in pancreatic cancer. The elective nodal coverage with SIB-SBRT strategy can be one of the treatment options for pancreatic SBRT and should be further investigated.",Excluded
1659,"Current psychological distress, post-traumatic stress, and radiation health anxiety remain high for those who have rebuilt permanent homes following the Fukushima nuclear disaster Objective: The Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster in 2011 produced psychological reactions among evacuees. Despite the harsh situation, subsequently, there has been gradual progress in reconstruction, with more than half of the evacuees returning after the evacuation. Our hypothesis is that evacuee mental health will now be better due to new stable living conditions. This study aims to clarify the statuses of psychological distress, post-traumatic stress, and radiation health anxiety among evacuees who have rebuilt permanent homes after evacuation. Method(s): A cross-sectional questionnaire survey of 1600 residents was conducted in 2020. As primary outcomes, the survey measured psychological distress (Kessler 6), post-traumatic stress (post-traumatic stress four-item checklist), and radiation health anxiety. The data are compared for residents who have rebuilt permanent home and those who did not evacuate. Result(s): In the co-variant analysis, the statuses of psychological distress (p < 0.001), post-traumatic stress (p < 0.001), and radiation health anxiety (p < 0.001) are found to still be high, with significant differences when compared to those who did not evacuate. These results are still at an equivalent level for the continuing evacuation. Conclusion(s): Our findings may indicate a necessity for continuing disaster-related mental health activities even though the living conditions have improved.Copyright © 2020 by the authors.

786,"Delayed imaging in routine CT examinations of the abdomen and pelvis: Is it worth the additional cost of radiation and time? OBJECTIVE. The purpose of this study was to retrospectively assess the potential benefits of delayed phase imaging series in routine CT scans of the abdomen and pelvis. MATERIALS AND METHODS. Routine contrast-enhanced abdominopelvic CT scans of 1000 consecutively examined patients (912 men, 88 women; average age, 60 years; range, 22-94 years) were retrospectively evaluated, and the added benefits of the delayed phase series through the abdomen were recorded for each examination. Examinations performed for indications requiring multiphasic imaging were excluded. Images were reviewed by two fellowship-trained abdominal radiologists, who were blinded to official CT reports. All examinations were performed between July 2008 and February 2010 at a single institution. Radiation doses for both the portal venous and delayed phases, when available, were analyzed to assess the effect of the delayed phase on overall radiation exposure. RESULTS. Forty-two patients (4.2%) had findings that were further characterized or were observed only in the delayed phase. Most were incidental findings that could have been confirmed at noninvasive follow-up imaging, such as sonography or unenhanced CT or MRI. The most common findings were liver hemangioma (n = 12), adrenal adenoma (n = 12), and parapelvic renal cysts (n = 6). The most important finding was detection of a renal mass in one patient (0.1%). The mass was seen only on the delayed phase images but was difficult to appreciate in the portal venous phase. In the other 958 patients (95.8%), delayed imaging was of no benefit. In addition, use of the delayed phase resulted in a mean 59.5% increase in effective CONCLUSION. An additional delayed phase through the abdomen in routine contrastenhanced CT examinations of the abdomen and pelvis is of low yield, particularly if reliable follow-up imaging to further elucidate uncertain findings is available. © American Roentgen Ray Society.",Excluded

However, the deleterious effects of exposure to medical diagnostic low-dose X-rays remain a highly debated topic. The objective was to study the effects of medical diagnostic X-rays on human blood cells. Material(s) and Method(s): We studied the effects of medical diagnostic low-dose X-rays (80 kVp), i.e.,0.01 or 0.05 mGy, after the in vitro exposure of human red blood cells (RBCs) and peripheral blood mononucleated cells (PBMCs).Cells with no irradiation served as the control group. The biological endpoints that were used to determine the effects of medical diagnostic low-dose X-rays were hemolysis for RBCs and mitochondrial membrane potential, lysosomes, and the cell cycle for PBMCs. Result(s): Our results showed no changes in the hemolysis of RBCs and mitochondrial membrane potential, lysosome, or cell cycle in cells exposed to these low doses of X-rays when compared to the corresponding nonirradiated cells at all harvest timepoints. Conclusion(s): These results suggested that there were no deleterious effects of diagnostic low-dose X-rays when human RBCs and PBMCs were exposed in vitro.Copyright © 2021, Ibn Sina Trust.

3606,"Generation of boundary manikin anthropometry The purpose of this study was to develop 3D digital 'boundary manikins' that are representative of the anthropometry of a unique population. These digital manikins can be used by designers to verify and validate that the components of the spacesuit design satisfy the requirements specified in the Human Systems Integration Requirements (HSIR) document. Currently, the HSIR requires the next generation space suit to accommodate the 1st percentile American female to the 99th percentile American male. The manikin anthropometry was derived using two methods: Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Whole Body Posture Based Analysis (WBPBA). PCA is a statistical method for reducing a multidimensional data set by using eigenvectors and eigenvalues. The goal was to create a reduced data set that encapsulates the majority of the variation in the population. WBPBA is a multivariate analytical approach that was developed by the Anthropometry and Biomechanics Facility (ABF) to identify the extremes of a population for a given body posture. WBPBA is a simulation-based method that finds extremes in a population based upon anthropometry and posture; whereas PCA is based solely on anthropometry. Both methods yielded a list of subjects and their anthropometry from a target population; PCA resulted in 20 female and 22 male subjects' anthropometry and WBPBA resulted in 7 subjects' anthropometry representing the extreme subjects in the target population. The subjects' anthropometry was then used to 'morph' a baseline digital scan of a person with the same body type to create a 3D digital model that can be used as a tool for designers.

375,"LED photoprevention: reduced MED response following multiple LED exposures BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: As photoprotection with traditional sunscreen presents some limitations, the use of non-traditional treatments to increase skin resistance to ultraviolet (UV) induced damage would prove particularly appealing. The purpose of this pilot study was to test the potential of non-thermal pulsed light-emitting diode (LED) treatments (660 nm) prior to UV exposure in the induction of a state of cellular resistance against UV-induced erythema., STUDY DESIGN/MATERIALS AND METHODS: Thirteen healthy subjects and two patients with polymorphous light eruption (PLE) were exposed to 5, 6, or 10 LED treatments (660 nm) on an EXPERIMENTAL anterior thigh region. Individual baseline minimal erythema doses (MED) were then determined. UV radiation was thereafter performed on the LED EXPERIMENTAL and CONTROL anterior thigh areas. Finally, 24 hours post-UV irradiation, LED pre-treated MED responses were compared to the non-treated sites., RESULTS: Reduction of erythema was considered significant when erythema was reduced by >50% on the LED-treated side as opposed to CONTROL side. A significant LED treatment reduction in UV-B induced erythema reaction was observed in at least one occasion in 85% of subjects, including patients suffering from PLE. Moreover, there was evidence of a dose-related pattern in results. Finally, a sun protection factor SPF-15-like effect and a reduction in post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation were observed on the LED pre-treated side., CONCLUSIONS: Results suggest that LED based therapy prior to UV exposure provided significant protection against UV-B induced erythema. The induction of cellular resistance to UV insults may possibly be explained by the induction of a state a natural resistance to the skin via specific cell signaling pathways and without the drawbacks and limitations of traditional sunscreens. These results represent an encouraging step towards expanding the potential applications of LED therapy and could be useful in the treatment of patients with anomalous reactions to sunlight.",Excluded
1131,"Sonographic evaluation of anterior inferior iliac spine morphology demonstrates excellent accuracy when compared to false profile view PURPOSE: To compare ultrasound examination to false profile radiographs in identification and classification of AIIS morphology. The study hypothesis stated that sonographic imaging of the AIIS correlates well to AIIS morphology seen on false profile radiographs. METHOD(S): Fifty-three hips in 30 consecutive patients met the inclusion criteria. A single, fellowship trained, orthopedic surgeon performed an ultrasound on all of the patients to evaluate the AIIS morphology. The patients underwent standing false profile radiographs. The US and radiographic images were independently reviewed and classified according to Hetsroni classification of AIIS morphology by two senior, fellowship trained, orthopedic surgeons. Agreement between the two raters was calculated for each imaging modality (inter-rater agreement) as well as the agreement between the rating in each modality by the same rater (""inter-method"" agreement). RESULT(S): The agreement between the raters (inter-rater agreement) for morphologic evaluation of the AIIS by means of FP view was 88.8% (p<0.001) and that by means of US was 81.5%(p<0.001). The overall accuracy of the US compared to the FP view was 92.3% (48/52) for both rater 1 and 2.

We sought whether abnormal ESPVR reflected subclinical diabetic heart disease by examining the association between the ESPVR and markers of myocardial dysfunction and to establish if the change (delta) or peak systolic blood pressure/end-systolic left ventricular volume ratio (SP/ESV) is a better marker of contractile reserve in type 2 diabetes mellitus. Methods and Results-Resting and exercise echocardiography was performed in 167 apparently healthy patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (97 men; age, 55+/-10 years) without ischemia, other cardiac disease, or noncardiac complications of diabetes. Standard echocardiographic and color tissue Doppler measures (early diastolic tissue velocity, strain, and strain rate) were acquired at baseline and peak stress in apical long-axis views. Calibrated integrated backscatter was calculated from a resting parasternal long-axis view. deltaSP/ESV was calculated as [(peak stress SP/ESV)-(rest SP/ESV)]. The 83 subjects who demonstrated a deltaSP/ESV <=12 mm Hg/mL/m2 after exercise were older and had lower peak heart rate, resting diastolic and stress systolic tissue velocity, stress ejection fraction, and exercise capacity than the remainder. There was no significant association between deltaSP/ESV and metabolic derangement or echocardiographic measures of deformation or backscatter. Change in Sm and stress ejection fraction were independent correlates of deltaSP/ESV. Conclusions-deltaSP/ESV ratio is associated with established features of subclinical diabetic heart disease as well as determinants of contractile reserve (peak hemodynamic response and stress systolic function). Peak ESPVR is poorly associated with markers of myocardial dysfunction. © 2010 American Heart Association, Inc.",Excluded

Refraction, visual acuity, endothelial cell density, corneal pachymetry, total corneal power, and stray light were evaluated preoperatively and 1 (except endothelial cell density and stray light), 3, 6, and 12 months postoperatively. Patients filled out a subjective questionnaire at 12 months postoperatively., RESULTS: Comparison of preoperative versus 12-month postoperative median values revealed a significant improvement in uncorrected near visual acuity (UNVA) from 0.60 (20/80) to 0.10 logMAR (20/25) (P<.0001) and a significant decrease in corrected distance visual acuity (CDVA) from -0.10 (20/16) to 0.00 logMAR (20/20), which equals a median loss of one line (P=.0005). Fifteen percent of patients lost two lines of CDVA in the treated eye. Subjective spherical equivalent refraction remained unchanged at 0.00 diopters (D) (P=.194).

2346,"Ultraviolet polarisation sensitivity in the stomatopod crustacean Odontodactylus scyllarus The ommatidia of crustacean eyes typically contain two classes of photoreceptors with orthogonally oriented microvilli. These receptors provide the basis for two-channel polarisation vision in the blue-green spectrum. The retinae of gonodactyloid stomatopod crustaceans possess a great variety of structural specialisations for elaborate polarisation vision. One type of specialisation is found in the small, distally placed R8 cells within the two most ventral rows of the mid-band. These ultraviolet-sensitive photoreceptors produce parallel microvilli, a feature suggestive for polarisation-sensitive photoreceptors. Here, we show by means of intracellular recordings combined with dye-injections that in the gonodactyloid species Odontodactylus scyllarus, the R8 cells of mid-band rows 5 and 6 are sensitive to linear polarised ultraviolet light. We show that mid-band row 5 R8 cells respond maximally to light with an e-vector oriented parallel to the mid-band, whereas mid-band row 6 R8 cells respond maximally to light with an e-vector oriented perpendicular to the mid-band. This orthogonal arrangement of ultraviolet-sensitive receptor cells could support ultraviolet polarisation vision. R8 cells of rows 5 and 6 are known to act as quarter-wave retarders around 500 nm and thus are the first photoreceptor type described with a potential dual role in polarisation vision.",Excluded

1851,"Functional Preservation after Planned Partial Resection Followed by Gamma Knife Radiosurgery for Large Vestibular Schwannomas Objective The treatment goal for vestibular schwannomas (VS) has been changed from total removal of the tumor to functional preservation with long-term tumor growth control. The small- to medium-sized VS can be treated by stereotactic radiosurgery, but large VS require surgical decompression for the relief of cerebellar dysfunction and increased intracranial pressure. We have been performing planned partial surgical resections followed by gamma knife radiosurgery (GKS) for large VS. Here, we evaluate a recent series of such cases from the standpoint of functional outcomes. Methods From January 2000 to May 2013, we treated 40 patients with large unilateral VS (maximum tumor diameter at least 25 mm) with planned partial tumor removal followed by GKS for functional preservation. The median maximum diameter of the tumors was 32.5 mm (range 25-52 mm). All patients underwent surgery via the retrosigmoid approach, and tumors situated on the ventral and in the internal auditory canal intentionally were not removed, thus preserving cranial nerve functions. GKS was performed 1-12 months after surgical resection (median interval 3 months). The median tumor volume at GKS was 3.3 cm3 (range 0.4-10.4 cm3) and the median prescribed dose was 12 Gy (range 10-12 Gy). The median follow-up period after GKS was 65 months (18-156 months). Results At the final follow-up, facial nerve preservation (House-Brackmann grade I-II) was achieved in 38 patients (95%; House-Brackmann grade I: 92.5%, II: 2.5%). Among the 14 patients with preoperative pure tone average (PTA) less than 50 dB, 6 of them (42.9%) maintained PTA less than 50 dB at the last follow-up. Two patients improved from severe hearing loss to PTA less than 50 dB (1 patient after surgery and 1 patient one and half years after GKS). Five- and 10-year tumor growth control occurred in 86% of patients. Four patients (10%) required salvage surgery; the predictive factor was tumor volume greater than 6 cm3 at GKS (P = 0.01). Conclusions Planned partial removal of large VS followed by GKS achieved a high rate of facial nerve and hearing preservation. To achieve long-term tumor growth control, the tumor volume at GKS after planned partial surgical resection should be smaller than 6 cm3. Our results revealed that patients with hearing preservation postoperatively have a chance of maintaining hearing function, even though the possibility exists of deterioration by long-term follow-up after surgical intervention and GKS. Furthermore, some patients with severe hearing loss before treatment have the chance of hearing improvement, even those with large VS.Copyright © 2015 Elsevier Inc.",Excluded
1230,"Potential welfare impacts of kill-trapping European moles (Talpa europaea) using scissor traps and Duffus traps: A Post mortem examination study Moles are widely trapped as pests on farms and amenity land in Britain. Spring traps for killing mammals generally require welfare approval in the UK, but mole traps are exempt. Previous research demonstrated wide variation in the mechanical performance of mole traps. In this context, we aimed to produce new data on the welfare impact of kill-trapping moles in the field. We collected 50 moles trapped in southern England (November 2008-August 2009). Captures peaked during the peak in male breeding activity, when captures were almost exclusively male. Post mortem and x-ray (radiation) examinations were conducted to determine injuries and likely cause of death. No moles sustained damaged skulls or upper cervical vertebrae (which could cause unconsciousness immediately). The primary identifiable cause of death for all but one mole was acute haemorrhage; this contrasts with the findings of the only previous such study, in which only one mole showed clear evidence of haemorrhaging. Some moles may have asphyxiated although it was not possible to determine this. Moles most likely became unconscious before death, but times to unconsciousness, and death, can be determined only through killing trials and further investigation is urgently needed. This should be done through the spring traps approval process; this could improve the welfare standards of trapping for many thousands of moles each year. Mole trapping for long-term population control might be better targeted after the peak in male breeding activity, when females are more likely to be caught, but this would threaten the welfare of dependent young underground.Copyright © 2015 Universities Federation for Animal Welfare.",Excluded
870,"Intraoperative radiotherapy as adjuvant treatment for stage II/III rectal carcinoma In recent years, many efforts have focused on combined radiotherapy and chemotherapy as adjuvants to curative surgery in patients with stage II and III (UICC) rectal carcinomas. Intraoperative radiotherapy (IORT) makes it possible to increase the total irradiation dose in a locally restricted area while sparing normal mobile organs, but it is limited by increased late toxicity. A prospective phase I/II study was designed to evaluate the efficacy of moderate-dose intraoperative and external beam radiotherapy (IO-EBRT), in some cases with concomitant chemotherapy. Sixty-three patients with a stage II or III rectal carcinoma were eligible for analysis (median follow-up 30.6 months). Fifty-four patients had undergone a complete resection (RO). Mean IORT dose was 11.3 Gy and mean EBRT dose 41.4 Gy. In 45 patients (71.4%) concomitant chemotherapy was delivered (5-FU, leucovorin). Two patients suffered local failure. However, overall local tumor control was markedly improved compared to historical controls (96.8% vs 66.2%). Patients treated with IO-EBRT showed a reduced incidence of distant metastases after concomitant chemotherapy (17.6% vs 38.8%). A 4-year actuarial relapse-free survival of 82% was obtained after IO-EBRT plus chemotherapy, and 59% after IO-EBRT alone. The postoperative course was unremarkable in 47.6% of patients.

It is characterized by rapid localization and clearance from the circulation with twice the skeletal uptake and better target to background ratio as compared with the conventional 99m Tc-MDP (methyl diphosphonate) bone scan agent. Additionally, 18 F-flouride PET/CT scans provide higher spatial resolution, shorter imaging time, and slightly less radiation. Furthermore, attenuation correction using CT provides better characterization of morphology and therefore increased accuracy. An analysis of 11 cases of 18 F-fluoride PET bone scans performed between June 2009 and July 2010 demonstrated accurate characterization and localization of osseous lesions as well as nonosseous metastatic lesions. The study population consisted of seven male and four female patients between the ages of 48-68 years with primary cancers of the prostate, kidney, colon, breast, bladder, lung, and the adrenal gland. The administered dose ranged from 7.7-13.6 mCi. Eight out of eleven scans were positive for metastatic disease and three were negative. All findings were correlated with CT. Early detection of bone metastases is significant in therapy planning and monitoring. Accurate demonstration of osseous metastases helps improve patient care and patient outcome. We believe 18 F-fluoride PET/CT can provide more thorough and conclusive evaluation of bone disease than the conventional 99m Tc-MDP. Educational Goals/Teaching Points: Overview of physiology, dosimetry, and clinical advantages of 18 F-NaF bone imaging compared with conventional Tc-MDP bone imaging. Key Anatomic/Physiologic Issues and Imaging Findings/Techniques: Role of 18 F-NaF PET imaging in detection of malignant and benign osseous disease.

3189,"Neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy with volumetric-modulated arc therapy for medium-distal oesophageal and gastro-oesophageal junction carcinoma Aim: to appraise the role of volumetric-modulated arc therapy (VMAT) in the neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy management of advanced medium and distal oesophageal cancer in terms of toxicity and response to treatment. Patients and Methods: Thirty patients were treated according to the neoadjuvant chemoradiation followed by surgery versus surgery-alone trial scheme with VMAT radiation therapy. Patients presented mainly T3-T4 stage (80%) and N1-2 (96.6%) disease. The chemotherapy scheme consisted of 3-5 cycles, while a radiotherapy course of 41.4 Gy in 23 fractions was administered to all patients. Result(s): The median age of patients was 65 years, and there was a predominance of males (80%), smokers or ex-smokers (90%) and modest alcohol habit (80% negative). Primary tumor localisation was in the medium and distal third of the oesophagus in 57% of the cases, the rest being in the gastro-oesophageal junction. Modest toxicity profiles were observed, with limited incidence of grade 2-3 events. Partial or complete response was observed in more than 90% of the cases (radiological/metabolic) and was confirmed after surgical intervention (67% partial or complete and 27% stable response). Tumor down-staging was recorded in 67% of patients and nodal down-staging in 50%. Conclusion(s): VMAT was applied in the context of neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy for the treatment of medium and distal oesophageal carcinoma with satisfactory results in terms of tolerance and toxicity.",Excluded

1995,"Induction treatment in patients with stage III non-small cell lung cancer Stage III non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) comprises a highly heterogeneous group of patients defined according to the extent and localization of disease. Patients with discrete N2 involvement identified preoperatively with resectable disease are candidates for multimodal therapy either with definitive chemoradiation therapy, induction chemotherapy, or chemoradiotherapy (CTRT) followed by surgery. Neoadjuvant chemotherapy has yielded comparable survival benefit to adjuvant chemotherapy in patients with stage II-III disease and may allow for downstaging the tumor or the lymph nodes, an earlier delivery of systemic treatment, and better compliance to systemic therapy. The use of immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) as induction therapy shows encouraging activity and a favorable safety profile in patients with resectable early stage or locally advanced NSCLC. An unprecedented rate of pathological response and downstaging has been reported in single-arm clinical trials, especially when immunotherapy is combined with neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Ongoing randomized phase II/III clinical trials assessing the efficacy and safety of induction with immunotherapy plus chemotherapy have the potential to establish this therapeutic approach as a novel standard of care. These trials aim to validate pathological response as a surrogate marker of survival benefit and to demonstrate that this therapeutic strategy can improve the cure rate in patients with stage II-III NSCLC.Copyright © Translational Lung Cancer Research.

2973,"Pre-operative Simulation of the Appropriate C-arm Position Using Computed Tomography Post-processing Software Reduces Radiation and Contrast Medium Exposure During EVAR Procedures Objective/Background The aim was to evaluate the feasibility and efficacy of a new method for pre-operative calculation of an appropriate C-arm position for iliac bifurcation visualisation during endovascular aortic repair (EVAR) procedures by using three dimensional computed tomography angiography (CTA) post-processing software. Methods Post-processing software was used to simulate C-arm angulations in two dimensions (oblique, cranial/caudal) for appropriate visualisation of distal landing zones at the iliac bifurcation during EVAR. Retrospectively, 27 consecutive EVAR patients (25 men, mean +/- SD age 73 +/- 7 years) were identified; one group of patients (NEW; n = 12 [23 iliac bifurcations]) was compared after implementation of the new method with a group of patients who received a historic method (OLD; n = 15 [23 iliac bifurcations]), treated with EVAR before the method was applied. Results In the OLD group, a median of 2.0 (interquartile range [IQR] 1-3) digital subtraction angiography runs were needed per iliac bifurcation versus 1.0 (IQR 1-1) runs in the NEW group (p = .007). The median dose area products per iliac bifurcation were 11951 mGy*cm2 (IQR 7308-16663 mGy*cm2) for the NEW, and 39394 mGy*cm2 (IQR 19066-53702 mGy*cm2) for the OLD group, respectively (p = .001). The median volume of contrast per iliac bifurcation was 13.0 mL (IQR: 13-13 mL) in the NEW and 26 mL (IQR 13-39 mL) in the OLD group (p = .007). Conclusion Pre-operative simulation of the appropriate C-arm angulation in two dimensions using dedicated computed tomography angiography post-processing software is feasible and significantly reduces radiation and contrast medium exposure.Copyright © 2016 European Society for Vascular Surgery",Excluded
1497,"320-Row Multidetector CT Angiography in the Detection of Critical Cerebrovascular Anomalies Background: The acquisition of a new 320-row multidetector computed tomography angiography (CTA) scanner at the Montreal Neurological Institute and Hospital has provided higher quality imaging with less radiation exposure and shorter time of acquisition. However, its reliability has not been fully proven in critical vascular lesions when it comes to replacing a more invasive examination such as cerebral angiography. We wished to validate the accuracy of this equipment to investigate four common indications for patients to undergo conventional digital subtraction angiography: subarachnoid hemorrhage, vasospasm, unusual intracerebral hemorrhage, and unruptured aneurysm. Method(s): Radiological reports and relevant imaging from 82 consecutive subjects who underwent a 320-row multidetector CTA followed by cerebral angiography from February 2010 to February 2014 were retrospectively analysed. A total of 102 cerebrovascular anomalies were found. Reports from both imaging modalities were compared to determine the diagnostic accuracy of CTA. Result(s): The overall sensitivity and specificity of 320-row multidetector CTA for detecting cerebrovascular abnormalities were, respectively, 97.60% and 63.20%. Similar results were obtained for all four categories of clinical indications. Conclusion(s): Results obtained from CTA were consistent with those obtained on digital subtraction angiography regardless of the vascular pathology. To our knowledge, this study is the first validating the accuracy of 320-row CTA in diagnosing critical cerebrovascular lesions.Copyright © The Canadian Journal of Neurological Sciences Inc. 2016.",Excluded
2292,"Effects of radiation therapy on the meibomian glands and dry eye in patients with ocular adnexal mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue lymphoma BACKGROUND: Radiation therapy (RT) is the treatment of choice in patients with low-grade ocular adenexal mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue lymphoma (OAML) and many of them experience post-RT dry eye with varying severity. The purpose of the present study was to investigate ocular effects of RT on meibomian glands and dry eye by directly visualizing structural changes. Secondly, we focused on the comparison of two groups of patients according to tumor location and radiation technique. METHOD(S): Sixty-four eyes with OAML of conjunctiva, orbit, lacrimal gland, or lacrimal sac were grouped into conjunctival lymphoma and ""orbital-type"" lymphoma (i.e., orbit, lacrimal gland, and lacrimal sac). Subjects were investigated for morphological changes in meibomian glands by meiboscore grading system. Radiation technique was examined and Ocular Surface Disease Index (OSDI) questionnaire, Schirmer's test, tear film break-up time (TBUT), slit lamp examination of corneal surface and lid margin abnormality were conducted before and after RT. RESULT(S): The increase in meiboscore was statistically significant over time after RT in both groups (P <0.001). The extent of increase in meiboscore was significantly greater in the ""orbital-type"" lymphoma group than in the conjunctival lymphoma group (P <0.001). The changes in OSDI, TBUT, corneal fluorescein staining score and lid margin abnormality score after RT were significantly different across two groups (P =0.042, 0.001, 0.035 and 0.001, respectively). Schirmer's value decreased after RT in both groups. Dry eye symptoms were most severe right after RT in both groups, but a gradual resolution was noted in most patients with conjunctival lymphoma, whereas symptoms persisted in ""orbital-type"" lymphoma patients. The OSDI score and corneal fluorescein staining score were positively correlated with meiboscore in ""orbital-type"" patients at post-RT 6months (r =0.43, P =0.04; r =0.39, P =0.03, respectively). CONCLUSION(S): Patients with OAML had different degrees of morphological changes in meibomian glands according to tumor location and radiation technique. ""Orbital-type"" lymphoma patients are more likely to experience severe injury to meibomian glands, which eventually leads to persistent dry eye. Patients with ""orbital-type"" lymphoma should be well informed of post-RT damage on meibomian glands and persistent dry eye.",Excluded
966,"IMRT in hypopharyngeal tumors BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) data on hypopharyngeal cancer (HC) are scant. In this study, the authors report on early results in an own HC patient cohort treated with IMRT. A more favorable outcome as compared to historical data on conventional radiation techniques was expected., PATIENTS AND METHODS: 29 consecutive HC patients were treated with simultaneous integrated boost (SIB) IMRT between 01/2002 and 07/2005 (mean follow-up 16 months, range 4-44 months). Doses of 60-71 Gy with 2.0-2.2 Gy/fraction were applied. 26/29 patients were definitively irradiated, 86% received simultaneous cisplatin-based chemotherapy. 60% presented with locally advanced disease (T3/4 Nx, Tx N2c/3). Mean primary tumor volume measured 36.2 cm(3) (4-170 cm(3)), mean nodal volume 16.6 cm(3) (0-97 cm(3))., RESULTS: 2-year actuarial local, nodal, distant control, and overall disease-free survival were 90%, 93%, 93%, and 90%, respectively. In 2/4 patients with persistent disease (nodal in one, primary in three), salvage surgery was performed. The mean dose to the spinal cord (extension of > 5-15 mm) was 26 Gy (12-38 Gy); the mean maximum (point) dose was 44.4 Gy (26-58.9 Gy). One grade (G) 3 dysphagia and two G4 reactions (laryngeal fibrosis, dysphagia), both following the schedule with 2.2 Gy per fraction, have been observed so far. Larynx preservation was achieved in 25/26 of the definitively irradiated patients (one underwent a salvage laryngectomy); 23 had no or minimal dysphagia (G0-1)., CONCLUSION: Excellent early disease control and high patient satisfaction with swallowing function in HC following SIB IMRT were observed; these results need to be confirmed based on a longer follow-up period. In order to avoid G4 reactions, SIB doses of < 2.2 Gy/fraction are recommended for large tumors involving laryngeal structures.",Excluded
684,"Facial involvement in indian psoriatic patients and its association with disease severity and metabolic syndrome-a cross-sectional study Introduction: Face was often thought to be spared in psoriasis possibly due to the protective effect of sebum and low-dose ambient UV radiation exposure. Few have suggested that facial involvement is common and indicates disease severity. There is a paucity of data on this, particularly from India. Psoriatics have a higher prevalence of metabolic syndrome (MetS) and, patients with severe disease are at greater risk. Objective(s): We decided to study the frequency, type of facial involvement in Indian psoriatic patients and its association with disease severity and MetS. Material(s) and Method(s): 250 consecutive psoriatic patients were enrolled. Facial psoriatics were divided into peripherofacial(PF), centrofacial(CF) and mixed facial(MF) types. Disease severity was assessed using whole body, scalp, facial Psoriasis area severity index (PASI) scores and Nail area psoriasis severity index (NAPSI) scores. Patients were evaluated for the presence of MetS using NCEP-III criteria. All parameters were compared both between facial and non-facial psoriatics and, between cases with different types of face involvement. Result(s): The mean age(p-0.04) and age of onset of disease(p-0.02) was lower and median whole body PASI score higher(p<0.001) in psoriatics with facial involvement than those without. No significant association was found between facial involvement and MetS. MF was the commonest type of facial involvement and there was a significant association of mixed facial involvement with increased total body PASI and head PASI scores. (p<0.001). Conclusion(s): Facial involvement in psoriatics is associated with severe disease, but not metabolic syndrome. Mixed facial type might be considered a marker of overall psoriasis disease severity in the Indian population.",Excluded
2604,"A Serum Small Molecule Biosignature of Radiation Exposure from Total Body Irradiated Patients The potential for radiological accidents and nuclear terrorism has increased the need for the development of new rapid biodosimetry methods. In addition, in a clinical setting the issue of an individual's radiosensitivity should be taken into consideration during radiotherapy. We utilized metabolomics and lipidomics to investigate changes of metabolites in serum samples following exposure to total body ionizing radiation in humans. Serum was collected prior to irradiation, at 3-8 h after a single dose of 1.25-2 Gy, and at 24 h with a total delivered dose of 2-3.75 Gy. Metabolomics revealed perturbations in glycerophosphocholine, phenylalanine, ubiquinone Q2, and oxalic acid. Alterations were observed in circulating levels of lipids from monoacylglycerol, triacylglycerol, phosphatidylcholine, and phosphatidylglycerol lipid classes. Polyunsaturated fatty acids were some of the most dysregulated lipids, with increased levels linked to proinflammatory processes. A targeted metabolomics approach for eicosanoids was also employed. The results showed a rapid response for proinflammatory eicosanoids, with a dampening of the signal at the later time point. Sex differences were observed in the markers from the untargeted approach but not the targeted method. The ability to identify and quantify small molecules in blood can therefore be utilized to monitor radiation exposure in human populations.",Included
2007,"Detection of suspected recurrent pancreatic adeno-carcinoma: Comparison of fluorine-18-fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose Positron Emission Tomography/Computed Tomography (PET) with contrast-enhanced Computed Tomography (CT) and serum CA 19.9 AIM: To establish the value of PET in the detection of suspected recurrent pancreatic adeno-carcinoma previously operated in comparison to contrast-enhanced multidetector CT and serum CA19.9. METHOD(S): Twenty-two patients (6 men, 16 women - mean age 77.6+/-2), previously operated for pancreatic adeno-carcinoma with suspected disease recurrence (increased CA19.9 > 40U/ml) were enrolled. Both PET and CT were performed in all cases. After visual analysis, maximum Standardized Uptake Values (SUVmax) of PET focal uptakes were calculated. PET data were compared to CT findings. The value of serum CA19.9 was also compared with the SUVmax obtained from each patient (in case of a patient with multiple lesions we considered the one with greater SUV max). RESULT(S): Out of 22 patients enrolled, 5 (22.7%) negative results at both PET and CT. In the 17 positive cases (77.3%) PET overall showed 26 areas of focal uptake divided as follow: 3 in pancreatic bed, 9 hepatic, 2 pulmonary, 9 nodal (7 sub diaphragmatic, 2 supra diaphragmatic) and 3 peritoneal. On the other hand CT overall showed 50 areas of contrast enhancement divided as follow: 1 in pancreatic bed, 6 in bone, 19 hepatic, 5 pulmonary, 17 nodal (12 sub diaphragmatic, 5 supra diaphragmatic), 1 peritoneal and 1 in adrenal gland. From the comparison between CA19.9 and SUVmax obtained for each patients, in 12 out of 17 positive PET cases we observed a statistically significant correlation (p<0, 05) between CA 19.9 trend and SUVmax. Five patients (22, 7%) with positive PET showed a not significant correlation between CA19.9 and SUVmax trend. The five cases with negative both PET and CT showed lower CA 19.9 levels than patients with positive PET. CONCLUSION(S): In patients with suspected pancreatic adeno-carcinoma relapse after surgery, PET reliably detected local and peritoneal recurrences, whereas CT seemed to be more sensitive for the detection of hepatic, bone, nodal and lung metastases. Although less reliable in the identification of lymph nodes, PET is able to clearly highlight mediastinal lymph nodes. Furthermore, PET does not appear to be advantageous for the detection of non locoregional and extra-abdominal recurrences. Our experience showed a significant direct correlation between CA 19.9 increase and SUVmax. Negative PET and CT cases with positive CA19.9 are probably due to the small size of recurrent disease. To confirm our data an improvement in casuistry is required.",Excluded

788,"G2 repair and chromosomal damage in lymphocytes from workers occupationally exposed to low-level ionizing radiation The effect of the G2 repair of chromosomal damage in lymphocytes from workers exposed to low levels of X- or gamma-rays was evaluated. Samples of peripheral blood were collected from 15 radiation workers, 20 subjects working in radiodiagnostics, and 30 healthy control donors. Chromosomal aberrations (CA) were evaluated by scoring the presence of chromatid and isochromatid breaks, dicentric and ring chromosomes in lymphocytes with/without 5 mM caffeine plus 3 mM-aminobenzamide (3-AB) treatment during G2. Our results showed that the mean value of basal aberrations in lymphocytes from exposed workers was higher than in control cells (p < 0.001). The chromosomal damage in G2, detected with caffeine plus 3-AB treatment was higher than the basal damage (untreated conditions), both in control and exposed populations (p < 0.05). In the exposed workers group, the mean value of chromosomal abnormalities in G2 was higher than in the control (p < 0.0001). No correlation was found between the frequency of chromosome type of aberrations (basal or in G2), and the absorbed dose. Nevertheless, significant correlation coefficients (p < 0.05) between absorbed dose and basal aberrations yield (r = 0.430) or in G2 (r = 0.448) were detected when chromatid breaks were included in the total aberrations yield. Under this latter condition no significant effect of age, years of employment or smoking habit on the chromosomal aberrations yield was detected. However, analysis of the relationship between basal aberrations yield and the efficiency of G2 repair mechanisms, defined as the percentage of chromosomal lesions repaired in G2, showed a significant correlation coefficient (r = -0.802; p < 0.001). These results suggest that in addition to the absorbed dose, the individual G2 repair efficiency may be another important factor affecting the chromosomal aberrations yield detected in workers exposed to low-level ionizing radiation.",Included

Preformulation studies including screening of excipients for solubility and pseudoternary phase diagrams suggested the suitability of Capmul MCM as lipid, Labrasol as surfactant, and Tween 20 as cosurfactant for preparation of self-emulsifying formulations. Preliminary composition of the SNEDDS formulations were selected from the phase diagrams and subjected to thermodynamic stability studies and dispersibility tests. The prepared liquid SNEDDS formulations were characterized for viscosity, refractive index, droplet size and zeta potential. The TEM study confirmed the formation of nanoemulsion following dilution of liquid SNEDDS. The optimized liquid SNEDDS were transformed into free flowing granules by adsorption on the porous carriers like Sylysia (350, 550, and 730) and Neusilin TM US2. Solid state characterization employing the FTIR, DSC and powder XRD studies indicated lack of any significant interaction of drug with the lipidic and emulsifying excipients, and porous carriers. In vitro drug release studies indicated faster solubilization of the drug by optimized SSNEGs (over 80% within 30 min) vis-a-vis the pure drug (only 35% within 30 min). In vivo pharmacokinetic studies in Wistar rats observed significant increase in C(max) (3.01-fold) and AUC (5.34-fold) using SSNEGs compared to pure drug, whereas no significant difference (p>0.1) was observed with the liquid SNEDDS. Thus, the present studies ratify the bioavailability enhancement potential of SSNEGs of ONH prepared using porous carriers. Copyright © 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",Excluded

One hundred eighty two patients were evaluated., METHODS: Assessment of salivary gland function was performed with salivary gland scintigraphy (SGS), sialometry, and subjective open questions to determine common side effects of RIT on salivary gland function., RESULTS: RIT had a strong association with decreased elimination counts by SGS. Patient age was the only variable associated with sialometry; age and the use of xerostomic drugs were strongly associated with decreased mean values of salivary flow. Dysphagia was strongly associated with RIT. Using multiple logistic regression analysis, age was determined to be an important factor associated with salivary gland dysfunction, and RIT was associated with impairment of saliva excretion., CONCLUSION: These results show that patients subjected to RIT have more difficulty in draining saliva, mainly from the parotid glands, which is associated with clinical dysphagia in this subset of patients.

Radiation and procedural data for index AF ablation procedures using four ablation techniques were compared: RF ablation with and without the anti-scatter grid (RF Grid and RF Gridless), and cryoballoon ablation utilising first and second-generation Medtronic Arctic Front Cryoballoons (Cryo; Arctic Front, Medtronic, Minneapolis, MN, USA), with and without 3D imaging during fluoroscopy (Cryo 3D and Cryo)., RESULTS: We studied 418 patients; 30 RF Grid, 68 RF No Grid, 12 Cryo 3D and 308 Cryo. The dose area product (DAP; Gycm2), adjusted for patient standardised weight of 80kg, was significantly higher for the Cryo 3D (21.91) and RF Grid (7.31) than the Cryo (2.13) and RF Gridless (3.31) groups; as a result, Cryo 3D was discontinued and RF Grid was only used when clinically required. Comparing the remaining groups, DAP for Cryo was significantly lower than RF Gridless (p<0.001) mainly attributable to a difference in fluoroscopy use (13.2 vs. 17.3 mins; p<0.001). Cryo procedure time was also significantly shorter (80 mins vs. 133 mins; p<0.01)., CONCLUSION: Cryoballoon AF ablations can be performed efficiently using Gridless fluoroscopy techniques achieving significant reduction in radiation exposure and procedure time while maintaining safety and efficacy. In this observational study, cryoballoon AF ablations compare favourably to conventional RF ablations in terms of these parameters.

This was a prospective study of 40 adult patients who underwent NECT-KUB for investigation of ureteric colic. Images were reconstructed using FBP, SIR, and MBIR techniques and individually and randomly assessed by two blinded radiologists. Parameters measured were overall image quality, presence of ureteric calculus, presence of hydronephrosis or hydroureters, image quality of each ureteric segment, total length of ureters unable to be visualized, attenuation values of image noise, and retroperitoneal fat content for each patient. There were no diagnostic discrepancies between image reconstruction modalities for urolithiasis. Overall image qualities and for each ureteric segment were superior using MBIR (67.5 % rated as 'Good to Excellent' vs. 25 % in SIR and 2.5 % in FBP). The lengths of non-visualized ureteric segments were shortest using MBIR (55.0 % measured 'less than 5 cm' vs. ASIR 33.8 % and FBP 10 %). MBIR was able to reduce overall image noise by up to 49.36 % over SIR and 71.02 % over FBP.

Breast cancer patients are a potential group to benefit from better guidance in the MRL. However, due to the electron return effect, the skin dose can be increased in presence of a magnetic field. Since large skin areas are generally involved in breast RT, the purpose of this study is to investigate the effects on the skin dose, for whole-breast irradiation (WBI) and accelerated partial-breast irradiation (APBI). In ten patients with early-stage breast cancer, targets and organs at risk (OARs) were delineated on postoperative CT scans co-registered with MRI. The OARs included the skin, comprising the first 5 mm of ipsilateral-breast tissue, plus extensions. Three intensity-modulated RT techniques were considered (2x WBI, 1x APBI). Individual beam geometries were used for all patients. Specially developed MRL treatment-planning software was used. Acceptable plans were generated for 0 T, 0.35 T and 1.5 T, using a class solution. The skin dose was augmented in WBI in the presence of a magnetic field, which is a potential drawback, whereas in APBI the induced effects were negligible.

2964,"Cetuximab plus chemoradiotherapy for HIV-associated anal carcinoma: A phase II AIDS malignancy consortium trial Purpose Squamous cell carcinoma of the anal canal (SCCAC) is characterized by high locoregional failure (LRF) rates after definitive chemoradiation (CRT), associated with anogenital human papilloma virus, and often appears in HIV infection. Because cetuximab enhances the effect of radiation therapy in human papilloma virus-associated oropharyngeal SCC, we hypothesized that adding cetuximab to CRT would reduce LRF in SCCAC. Methods Forty-five patients with stage I to III SCCAC and HIV infection received CRT: 45 to 54 Gy radiation therapy to the primary tumor and regional lymph nodes plus eight once-weekly doses of concurrent cetuximab and two cycles of cisplatin and fluorouracil. The study was designed to detect at least a 50% reduction in 3-year LRF rate (one-sided a, 0.10; power, 90%), assuming a 35% LRF rate from historical data. Results The 3-year LRF rate was 42% (95% CI, 28% to 56%; one-sided P = .9) by binomial proportional estimate using the prespecified end point (LRF or alive without LRF and followed , 3 years), and 20% (95% CI, 10% to 37%) by Kaplan-Meier estimate in post hoc analysis using definitions and methods consistent with historical data. Three-year rates by Kaplan-Meier estimate were 72% (95% CI, 56% to 84%) for progression-free survival and 79% (95% CI, 63% to 89%) for overall survival. Grade 4 toxicity occurred in 26%, and 4% had treatment-associated deaths. Conclusion HIV-associated SCCAC is potentially curable with definitive CRT. Although addition of cetuximab may result in less LRF, the 20% recurrence and 26% grade 4 toxicity rates indicate the continued need for more-effective and less-toxic therapies.Copyright © 2016 by American Society of Clinical Oncology.",Excluded
3569,"The biomechanical effects of 1.0 to 1.2 Mrad of gamma irradiation on human bone-patellar tendon-bone allografts Recent data suggest that anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction with irradiated allograft tissue may lead to increased failure rates. Low-dose (1.0-1.2 Mrad) gamma irradiation does not significantly alter the preimplantation biomechanical properties of bone-patellar tendon-bone (BTB) allografts. Controlled laboratory study. Cyclic and failure mechanical properties were evaluated for 20 paired central-third human BTB allografts, with and without 1.0 to 1.2 Mrad of gamma irradiation. Testing included cyclic loading at 0.5 Hz for 100 cycles from 50 to 200 N and failure testing at a strain rate of 10% per second. Cyclic elongation did not change significantly (P = .151) with irradiation, increasing from a mean +/- SD of 9.4 +/- 2.1 mm to 11.3 +/- 3.4 mm. Cyclic creep strain approached a significant increase with irradiation (1.3% +/- 0.8% to 2.6% +/- 1.5%; P = .076). Failure testing was not affected with irradiation with regard to maximum load (1680 +/- 417 mm to 1494 +/- 435 mm), maximum stress (40.8 +/- 10.6 MPa to 37.5 +/- 15.7 MPa), elongation (7.85 +/- 1.35 mm to 8.67 +/- 2.05 mm), or strain at maximum stress (0.158 +/- 0.03 to 0.175 +/- 0.03). Graft stiffness significantly decreased by 20% with irradiation (278 +/- 67 N/mm to 221 +/- 50 N/mm; P = .035). Low-dose (1.0-1.2 Mrad) gamma irradiation decreases BTB graft stiffness by 20%, but it does not affect other failure or cyclic parameters. Aside from graft stiffness during load to failure testing, low-dose (1.0-1.2 Mrad) gamma irradiation of central-third human BTB allografts is not deleterious to preimplantation biomechanical properties.",Included
2736,"Long-term results of radiation therapy for pituitary adenoma Purpose. Local control for pituitary adenomas treated with external beam radiation therapy was retrospectively analyzed to evaluate the efficacy of radiation. Materials and methods. Thirty-eight patients treated with radiation therapy between 1979 and 1994 were analyzed. The median age was 46. Nineteen newly diagnosed tumors were treated with surgery and radiation therapy, while the others were recurrent cases. Twenty-two tumors were non-functioning, while 10 produced growth hormone (GH) and three each were prolactin-, and adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH)-producing tumors. The median radiation dose was 50 Gy in 25 fractions. Results. Non-functioning adenomas and prolactin-producing adenomas were completely controlled, judging from the absence of tumor progression on neuroimaging studies and clinical symptoms, and normalization of the serum prolactin level (< 25 ng/ml). On the other hand, local control was obtained in only one of the 3 patients with ACTH-producing adenomas, and the control rate at 10 years was only 46% for GH-producing adenomas. Panhypopituitarism developed in 35% of the patients after radiation therapy. No other serious complications were noted. Conclusion. Non-functioning pituitary adenomas and prolactin-producing adenomas were well controlled with external radiation therapy combined with surgery. However, dose escalation might be necessary to control GH- or ACTH-producing tumors. It is important to replace corticosteroid hormone and thyroid hormone in many patients.",Excluded
378,"Mandibular dental implant placement immediately after teeth removal in head and neck cancer patients Background: Little is known about immediate implant placement in head and neck cancer patients. We studied implant survival and functional outcomes of overdentures fabricated on implants placed immediately after removal of the lower dentition during ablative surgery or preceding primary radiotherapy (RT). Method(s): Inclusion criteria were primary head and neck cancer, dentate lower jaw, and indication for removal of remaining teeth. Two implants to support a mandibular overdenture were placed immediately after extraction of the dentition during ablative surgery, or prior to starting primary radiotherapy. Standardized questionnaires and clinical assessments were conducted (median follow-up 18.5 months, IQR 13.3). Result(s): Fifty-eight implants were placed in 29 patients. Four implants were lost (implant survival rate 93.1%). In 9 patients, no functional overdenture could be made. All patients were satisfied with their dentures. Conclusion(s): Combining dental implant placement with removal of remaining teeth preceding head neck oncology treatment results in a favorable treatment outcome.Copyright © 2020, The Author(s).",Excluded

METHOD(S): Women diagnosed with breast cancer (n = 6213) and randomly selected age-matched control subjects (n = 7390) provided breast cancer risk factor information and occupational history. A qualified industrial hygienist classified each job for EMF exposure as background, low, medium, or high. RESULT(S): When compared with the referent of background exposure, the odds ratio adjusted for age and state of residence was 1.06 (95% CI = 0.99-1.14) for low exposure, 1.09 (95% CI = 0.96-1.23) for medium exposure, and 1.16 (95% CI = 0.90-1.50) for high exposure. CONCLUSION(S): Our findings, taken together with previous epidemiological studies, suggest that exposure to EMF in the workplace may be associated with a slight elevation in breast cancer risk. ©2007The American College of Occupational and Environmental Medicine.",Excluded
3225,"Persistence of chromatid aberrations in the cells of solid mouse tissues exposed to 137Cs gamma radiation Primary mouse ear and kidney cultures were established for determination of cytogenetic aberrations at short (3 days to 1 month) and long (12-23 months) times after exposure of their right sides to 7.5 Gy of (137)Cs gamma radiation. In every case, higher levels of aberrations were observed in primary cultures established from the irradiated tissues than in those established from the contralateral tissues. The most common aberrations in the contralateral tissues and those from nonirradiated mice were chromatid and isochromatid breaks and small chromatid fragments. Primary cells from irradiated tissues removed from animals within a month of exposure displayed a variety of unstable chromosome-type aberrations characteristic of recent exposure to ionizing radiation including rings, dicentrics, double minutes, and large acentric fragments. The percentages of cells exhibiting chromatid breaks and small chromatid fragments were also markedly elevated. Although the levels of chromosome-type aberrations found in primary cells from irradiated tissues dropped to near background levels a year or more after exposure, chromatid-type aberrations remained elevated. These results are consistent with long-term persistence of damage in the genomes of ionizing radiation-exposed cells in solid tissues and the induction of genomic instability in vivo.",Included
3603,"Fractionated re-irradiation for local recurrence following stereotactic body radiotherapy for primary and metastatic lung cancers Purpose/Objective(s): The effectiveness of re-irradiation for local recurrence following stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) has not been reported.We evaluated clinical outcomes of fractionated re-irradiation for local recurrence following SBRT for primary and metastatic lung cancers, retrospectively. Materials/Methods: Between April 2003 and December 2010, 410 patients with primary or metastatic lung tumor received SBRT in Kyushu University Hospital, and 47 patients developed local recurrence after SBRT. Fractionated re-irradiation was performed in 16 patients who were medically inoperable or refused surgery. The median age of 16 patients was 80 years (range 52- 88 years). Fourteen patients were male, and two were female. Thirteen patients had primary lung cancer, and three had metastatic lung tumor. The median tumor size was 41 mm (range 19 - 66 mm) and three patients had regional lymph node metastases. Radiation dose ranged from 60 to 70 Gy at 1.8 - 2 Gy per fraction. Concurrent chemotherapy was given in six patients. Result(s): Median follow-up was 10.2 months (range 1.6 - 21.2 months). Local re-recurrence was observed in 8 patients. Five patients died of recurrence and one patient died from other diseases. Local control rate, cause-specific survival and overall survival at 1 were 66.5%, 90.9% and 90.9%, respectively. No severe adverse events were observed in all patients during follow-up. Conclusion(s): Although the follow-up period was short, fractionated re-irradiation may be safe and an effective treatment option for local recurrence following SBRT. To confirm the effectiveness, a further accumulation of patients and longer follow-up are required.",Excluded
3465,"Retroperitoneal soft tissue sarcoma: low-dose neoadjuvant radiation therapy followed by surgery with or without intraoperative radiotherapy and adjuvant radiation therapy Background: We describe the clinical history, outcome, and toxicity of five patients with high-grade retroperitoneal soft tissue sarcoma (RSTS) who were treated with neoadjuvant low-dose radiotherapy (RT) followed by resection with or without intraoperative radiotherapy (IORT), followed by adjuvant RT. We aim to provide additional evidence for the various treatment options that exist for this rare tumor entity. Method(s): Most patients presented with mild abdominal symptoms. Diagnosis was confirmed by biopsy. Additional imaging was done by sonography, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and/or positron emission tomography (PET)/computed tomography (CT). All patients were treated with neoadjuvant RT of 19.8Gy in 1.8-Gy fractions followed by resection and postoperative RT up to 45Gy with a median interval between resection and start of postoperative RT of 5 weeks. Two patients received additional IORT. Median follow-up was 61 months. Result(s): One patient developed a local recurrence that was diagnosed 30 months after the start of the first therapy. He was treated with a salvage resection and had no evidence of disease at the last follow-up. Another patient developed a right-sided RSTS on the contralateral side from the primary radiation field with pelvic bone infiltration 56 months after the start of RT. He was treated again by RT and resection and was without evidence of disease at last follow-up. Radiotherapy was well tolerated without major toxicity. Conclusion(s): The treatment of RSTS by low-dose neoadjuvant RT, resection with IORT and adjuvant RT seems to be a feasible and effective treatment approach. Further studies comparing neoadjuvant with adjuvant RT are necessary to find the best treatment option.Copyright © 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.",Excluded

Material(s) and Method(s): Eighty-three patients who had undergone CT venography of the lower extremities with MBIR at 80 kVp (Group A; 21 men and 20 women; mean age, 55.5 years) or ASIR-V at 70 kVp (Group B; 18 men and 24 women; mean age, 57.3 years) were enrolled. Two radiologists retrospectively evaluated the objective (vascular enhancement, image noise, signal-to-noise ratio [SNR], contrast-to-noise ratio [CNR]) and subjective (quantum mottle, delineation of contour, venous enhancement) image quality indicators at the inferior vena cava and femoral and popliteal veins. Clinical information, radiation dose, reconstruction time, and objective and subjective image quality indicators were compared between groups A and B. Result(s): Vascular enhancement, SNR, and CNR were significantly greater in Group B than in Group A (p <= 0.015). Image noise was significantly lower in Group B (p <= 0.021), and all subjective image quality indicators, except for delineation of vein contours, were significantly better in Group B (p <= 0.021). Mean reconstruction time was significantly shorter in Group B than in Group A (1 min 43 s vs. 131 min 1 s; p < 0.001). Clinical information and radiation dose were not significantly different between the two groups.

Materials: patients (>= 18 years old) affectedby HGG (III and IV gradeWHO), with a CTV1 (tumor bed +/- residual tumour) < 8 cm were enrolled into this study. Total radiation dose (6940 cGy) was administered using a combination of two different techniques: conformal 3D-RT and FSCRT Radiation dose of 3D-CRT was 5040 cGy if FSCRT boost was concomitant plus sequential or 5940 cGy if only sequential. FSCRT was 1900 cGy if concomitant plus sequential boost or 1000 cGy if only sequential boost. These two different schedules were tailored by CTVI diameter ( 6 em or over 6 em until 8cm). Temozolomide(75 mg/m2 ) wasadministered during the first two or four weeks of radiotherapyrelated to FSCRTmodality. After the end of RTTemozolomide (150-200 mg/m2 ) was administered for at least 6 cycles.

3144,"Spine stereotactic body radiotherapy for renal cell cancer spinal metastases: Analysis of outcomes and risk of vertebral compression fracture Object. The aim of this study was to evaluate local control (LC) and the risk of vertebral compression fracture (VCF) after stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) in patients with renal cell cancer spinal metastases. Methods. Prospectively collected data on 71 spinal segments treated with SBRT in 37 patients were reviewed. The median follow-up was 12.3 months (range 1.2-55.4 months). The LC rate was assessed based on each spinal segment treated and overall survival (OS) according to each patient treated. Sixty of 71 segments (85%) were radiation naive, 11 of 71 (15%) were previously irradiated, and 10 of 71 (14%) were treated with postoperative SBRT. The median SBRT total dose and number of fractions were 24 Gy and 2, respectively. The VCF analysis also included evaluation of the Spinal Instability Neoplastic Score criteria. Results. The 1-year OS and LC rates were 64% and 83%, respectively. Multivariate analysis identified oligometastatic disease (13 of 37 patients) as a positive prognostic factor (p = 0.018) for OS. Of 61 non-postoperative spinal segments treated, 10 (16%) developed VCFs; 3 of 10 were de novo VCFs and 7 of 10 occurred as progression of an existing VCF. The 1-year VCF-free probability rate was 82%. Multivariate analysis identified single-fraction SBRT and baseline VCF as significant predictors of SBRT-induced VCF (p = 0.028 and p = 0.012, respectively). Conclusions. Spine SBRT yields high rates of local tumor control in patients with renal cell cancer. Baseline VCF and 18-24 Gy delivered in a single fraction were predictive of further collapse. Patients with oligometastatic disease may benefit most from such aggressive local therapy, given the prolonged survival observed.Copyright © AANS, 2014.",Excluded
3531,"Incidence of dementia among atomic-bomb survivors--Radiation Effects Research Foundation Adult Health Study Radiotherapy has been reported to cause neuropsychological dysfunction. Here we examined whether exposure to atomic bomb radiation affected the incidence of dementia among 2286 atomic bomb survivors and controls - all members of the Adult Health Study cohort. Study subjects were non-demented and aged >or=60 years at baseline examination and had been exposed in 1945 at >or=13 years of age to a relatively low dose (<or=4 Gy), compared with total dose from radiotherapy. Dementia diagnoses were made during biennial health examinations with a two-phase procedure. DSM IV criteria were used for diagnosing dementia, NINCDS-ADRDA for Alzheimer disease, and NINDS-AIREN for vascular disease. To estimate the effect of radiation on the dementia incidence rate, we applied Poisson regression analysis. Incidence per 1000 person-years was 16.3 in the <5 mGy group, 17.0 in the 5-499 mGy group, and 15.2 in the >or=500 mGy group. Alzheimer disease was the predominant type of dementia in each dose category. After adjustment for potential risk factors, radiation exposure did not affect the incidence rate of either all dementia or any of its subtypes. No case of dementia had a history of therapeutic cranial irradiation. Although we found no relationship between radiation exposure and the development of dementia among atomic bomb survivors exposed at >or=13 years old in this longitudinal study, effects on increased risk of early death among atomic bomb survivors will be considered.",Included
913,"Should adjuvant radiotherapy be recommended following resection of regional lymph node metastases of malignant melanomas? Background: Several authors have recommended adjuvant radiotherapy following resection of regional lymph node metastases in cutaneous malignant melanoma. There is, however, little evidence from controlled trials that patients benefit from this treatment. Objective(s): To evaluate the usefulness of adjuvant, radiotherapy following resection of lymph node metastases in cutaneous malignant melanoma. Method(s): We performed a retrospective study comparing 58 patients who underwent radiotherapy following resection of regional lymph node metastases with 58 controls from another centre who exclusively underwent regional lymphadenectomy. Patients and their controls were matched with respect to the number of tumour-bearing lymph nodes (1 vs. 1) and to gender, although the proportion of thick tumours was greater in the irradiation group. Result(s): The overall survival curves were almost identical in the two groups. There were nine disease recurrences in the study group and 12 in the control group (not significant). Regional recurrences in the irradiated patients were usually accompanied by metastases at other sites. Conclusion(s): The present study does not support the recommendation of adjuvant radiotherapy following resection of regional lymph node metastases in patients with malignant melanoma.",Included

Efficacy of a potential quarantine treatment dose was evaluated for its practicality by a small scale-up validation test at a commercial facility., MATERIALS AND METHODS: X-ray treatments at different doses of 50, 100, 200, and 300 Gy were carried out with eggs, larvae, pupae and adults of SWD. The trial at the commercial facility was performed with pupae at 150 Gy., RESULTS: X-ray radiation inhibited development of all stages of SWD, and the estimated dose to cause 99% mortality or to prevent emergence (ED99) are reported here. Irradiation to eggs inhibited hatching, pupariation and adult emergence at 1962, 649 and 31 Gy, respectively. The inhibition of irradiated larvae to adult emergence was 66 Gy. Irradiation to pupae could not inhibit adult emergence completely even at 300 Gy. However, irradiation at 100 Gy and above induced complete adult sterility. Irradiation to pupae inhibited hatching of F1 eggs at 73 Gy, while for adults, total inhibition of F1 egg hatching was observed at 822 Gy. In the trial at the commercial facility, radiation at 150 Gy to pupae induced complete adult sterility in all combinations of cross-mating between treated or untreated males and females., CONCLUSION: This study suggests that X-ray radiation can be recommended as an alternative to methyl bromide as phytosanitary treatment for quarantine purpose.",Included
474,"Functional MR urography for assessment of obstructive and reflux uropathies Purpose - Objective. In congenital anomalies of the kidney and urinary tract (CAKUT) the role of MRI for classification is expanded by obtaining functional data. MAG3 scintigraphy is considered gold standard for functional analysis. Material and methods. From 04/2010 to 01/2012 20 patients from one university hospital were examined by a standardised MR urography (MRU) in a 1.5 Tesla scanner after i.v. hydration and furosemide i.v. The data was processed by a dedicated software (CHOP-fMRU). Results were compared with Tc99m MAG3 scintigraphy. Results. Twenty patients (5 female, 15 male; age 5 weeks to 18.4 years) had both MR urography and MAG3 scintigraphy (1 to 484; average 48 days). All patients had isolated or combined CAKUT (6 duplex kidneys; 7 proximal, 11 distal ureteral stenoses; 8 subvesical obstructions; 10 VUR). Split renal function values differed by an average 8.2 % (min 1 %, max 18 %). Curve types after O' Reilly were available in 36 kidneys (4 kidneys were multicystic dysplastic with no residual organ function). There was a relevant discrepancy in one case only (norml in scintigraphy, relevant obstruction in MRU). Discussion and conclusions. X-ray excretion urography was replaced by earlier MRU. The CHOP-fMRU examination protocol is very robust and reliable and able to give as much information as MAG3 scintigraphy. It is now possible to receive information on morphology, excretion, and split renal function with one examination.",Excluded
3102,"Evaluation of gait speed after applying kinesio tape on quadriceps femoris muscle in patients with knee osteoarthritis BACKGROUND: Knee osteoarthritis is a chronic degenerative disease, known as the most common cause of difficulty walking in older adults and subsequently is associated with slow walking. Functional decline, increased risk of falls and the presence of pain are, in many studies, related to the muscle weakness caused by osteoarthritis especially weakness of the quadriceps muscles. Many studies have shown that the strength of the quadriceps femoris muscle can affect gait, by improving or weakening it. Kinesio Tape is a physiotherapeutic technique, which reduces pain and increases muscular strength by irritating the skin receptors. AIM: This study aimed to verify if the application of Kinesio Tape on quadriceps femoris muscle increases gait speed while decreasing the time needed to accomplish the 10-meter walk test in patients with knee osteoarthritis and also in subjects without knee osteoarthritis. METHOD(S): In this study, we observed the change of gait speed with the help of the 10-meter walk test before, one day and three days after the application of Kinesio Tape in quadriceps femoris muscle. We compared the results of the time needed to perform the 10-meter walk in two groups. In the first group, the Patients group, participated 102 out-patients with a clinical diagnosis of primary knee osteoarthritis, while in the second group, the Control group, participated 73 subjects with a main excluding criterion a clinical diagnosis of primary knee osteoarthritis. RESULT(S): Our results indicated that there was a significant decrease of time needed to perform the 10-meter walk test in both groups three days after application of Kinesio Tape on quadriceps femoris muscle. However, there was not a significant change one day after the application of Kinesio Tape compared before its application in both groups. CONCLUSION(S): Our results indicated that there was a significant decrease in time needed to accomplish the 10-meter walk test. Kinesio Tape is a technique that can be used especially when changing walking stereotypes is a long-term goal of the treatment.Copyright © 2018 Klejda Tani, Irena Kola, Vjollca Shpata, Fregen Dhamaj.

1365,"[123 I]Iodometomidate for molecular imaging of adrenocortical cytochrome P450 family 11B enzymes BACKGROUND: Due to advances in conventional imaging, adrenal tumors are detected with increasing frequency. However, conventional imaging provides only limited information on the origin of these lesions, which represent a wide range of different pathological entities. New specific imaging methods would therefore be of great clinical value. We, therefore, studied the potential of iodometomidate (IMTO) as tracer for molecular imaging of cytochrome P450 family 11B (Cyp11B) enzymes., METHODS: Inhibition of Cyp11B1 and Cyp11B2 by IMTO, etomidate, metomidate, and fluoroetomidate was investigated in NCI-h295 cells and in Y1 cells stably expressing hsCyp11B1 or hsCyp11B2. Pharmacokinetics and biodistribution after iv injection of [(123/125)I]IMTO were analyzed in mice in biodistribution experiments and by small-animal single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT). Furthermore, four patients with known adrenal tumors (two metastatic adrenal adenocarcinomas, one bilateral adrenocortical adenoma, and one melanoma metastasis) were investigated with [(123)I]iodometomidate-SPECT., RESULTS: In cell culture experiments, all compounds potently inhibited both Cyp11B1 and Cyp11B2. Adrenals showed high and specific uptake of [(123/125)I]IMTO and were excellently visualized in mice. In patients, adrenocortical tissue showed high and specific tracer uptake in both primary tumor and metastases with short investigation time and low radiation exposure, whereas the non-adrenocortical tumor did not exhibit any tracer uptake., CONCLUSION: We have successfully completed the development of an in vivo detection system of adrenal Cyp11B enzymes by [(123)I]IMTO scintigraphy in both experimental animals and humans. Our findings suggest that [(123)I]IMTO is a highly specific radiotracer for imaging of adrenocortical tissue. Due to the general availability of SPECT technology, we anticipate that [(123)I]IMTO scintigraphy may become a widely used tool to characterize adrenal lesions.",Excluded
3660,"Assessment of the degradation rates and effectiveness of different coated Mg-Zn-Ca alloy scaffolds for in vivo repair of critical-size bone defects Surgical repair of bone defects remains challenging, and the search for alternative procedures is ongoing. Devices made of Mg for bone repair have received much attention owing to their good biocompatibility and mechanical properties. We developed a new type of scaffold made of a Mg-Zn-Ca alloy with a shape that mimics cortical bone and can be filled with morselized bone. We evaluated its durability and efficacy in a rabbit ulna-defect model. Three types of scaffold-surface coating were evaluated: group A, no coating; group B, a 10-mum microarc oxidation coating; group C, a hydrothermal duplex composite coating; and group D, an empty-defect control. X-ray and micro-computed tomography(micro-CT) images were acquired over 12 weeks to assess ulnar repair. A mechanical stress test indicated that bone repair within each group improved significantly over time (P < 0.01). The degradation behavior of the different scaffolds was assessed by micro-CT and quantified according to the amount of hydrogen gas generated; these measurements indicated that the group C scaffold better resisted corrosion than did the other scaffold types (P < 0.05). Calcein fluorescence and histology revealed that greater mineral densities and better bone responses were achieved for groups B and C than for group A, with group C providing the best response. In conclusion, our Mg-Zn-Ca-alloy scaffold effectively aided bone repair. The group C scaffold exhibited the best corrosion resistance and osteogenesis properties, making it a candidate scaffold for repair of bone defects.",Excluded

The experimental group (30 patients) was treated with ""Xinjingjie mouthrinse"" during the full course of radiotherapy, 4 times daily with 5 mL and 5 min each time. The control group (30 patients) rinsed the mouth in the same way with normal saline. Oral mucositis was assessed according to the RTOG criteria. The severity of mucositis and the degree of pain were recorded and photographed. Patients shouldn't be treated with other drugs until the level of oral mucositis reached above grade III. The results were statistically analyzed using Stata 12.0 software packages., RESULTS: Age, gender, radiotherapy techniques and dose showed no significant difference between the 2 groups (P>0.05). The first onset of oral mucositis in the experimental group was later than that in the control group (11.0 times:9.1 times,P<0.05), and the incidence of pain at the early time of radiotherapy was lower (36.7%: 70.0%, P<0.05).

1488,"Carotid Artery Stenting With Proximal Embolic Protection via a Transradial or Transbrachial Approach: Pushing the Boundaries of the Technique While Maintaining Safety and Efficacy PURPOSE: To compare the feasibility and safety of proximal cerebral protection to a distal filter during carotid artery stenting (CAS) via a transbrachial (TB) or transradial (TR) approach., METHODS: Among 856 patients who underwent CAS between January 2007 and July 2015, 214 (25%) patients (mean age 72+/-8 years; 154 men) had the procedure via a TR (n=154) or TB (n=60) approach with either Mo.MA proximal protection (n=61) or distal filter protection (n=153). The Mo.MA group (mean age 73+/-7 years; 54 men) had significantly more men and more severe stenosis than the filter group (mean age 71+/-8 years; 100 men). Stent type and CAS technique were left to operator discretion. Heparin and a dedicated closure device or bivalirudin and manual compression were used in TR and TB accesses, respectively. Technical and procedure success, crossover to femoral artery, 30-day major adverse cardiovascular/cerebrovascular events (MACCE; death, all strokes, and myocardial infarction), vascular complications, and radiation exposure were compared between groups., RESULTS: Crossover to a femoral approach was required in 1/61 (1.6%) Mo.MA patient vs 11/153 (7.1%) filter patients mainly due to technical difficulty in engaging the target vessel. Five Mo.MA patients developed acute intolerance to proximal occlusion; 4 were successfully shifted to filter protection. A TR patient was shifted to filter because the Mo.MA system was too short. CAS was technically successful in the remaining 55 (90%) Mo.MA patients and 142 (93%) filter patients. The MACCE rate was 0% in the Mo.MA patients and 2.8% in the filter group (p=0.18). Radiation exposure was similar between groups. Major vascular complications occurred in 1/61 (1.6%) and in 3/153 (1.96%) patients in the Mo.MA and filter groups (p=0.18), respectively, and were confined to the TB approach in the early part of the learning curve. Chronic radial artery occlusion was detected by Doppler ultrasound in 2/30 (6.6%) Mo.MA patients and in 4/124 (3.2%) filter patients by clinical assessment (p=0.25) at 8.1+/-7.5-month follow-up., CONCLUSION: CAS with proximal protection via a TR or TB approach is a feasible, safe, and effective technique with a low rate of vascular complications.

127,"Cerebrovascular diseases in nuclear workers first employed at the Mayak PA in 1948-1972 Incidence and mortality from cerebrovascular diseases (CVD) (430-438 ICD-9 codes) have been studied in a cohort of 18,763 workers first employed at the Mayak Production Association (Mayak PA) in 1948-1972 and followed up to the end of 2005. Some of the workers were exposed to external gamma-rays only while others were exposed to a mixture of external gamma-rays and internal alpha-particle radiation due to incorporated (239)Pu. After adjusting for non-radiation factors, there were significantly increasing trends in CVD incidence with total absorbed dose from external gamma-rays and total absorbed dose to liver from internal alpha radiation. The CVD incidence was statistically significantly higher among workers with total absorbed external gamma-ray doses greater than 0.20 Gy compared to those exposed to lower doses; the data were consistent with a linear trend in risk with external dose. The CVD incidence was statistically significantly higher among workers with total absorbed internal alpha-radiation doses to liver from incorporated (239)Pu greater than 0.025 Gy compared to those exposed to lower doses. There was no statistically significant trend in CVD mortality risk with either external gamma-ray dose or internal alpha-radiation dose to liver. The risk estimates obtained are generally compatible with those from other large occupational studies, although the incidence data point to higher risk estimates compared to those from the Japanese A-bomb survivors. Further studies of the unique cohort of Mayak workers chronically exposed to external and internal radiation will allow improving the reliability and validating the radiation safety standards for occupational and public exposure.",Included
2622,"TRIACCESS study: Randomized comparison between radial, femoral and transpedal access for for percutanous supertfitial femoral artery angioplasty Background: Traditional access for the treatment of femoral artery lesions is the femoral artery (FA) approach, but radial (RA) and pedal access (PA) is an alternative access site. The aim of the study was to compare the success rate, complication rate of different access sites for the treatment of superfitial artery stenosis in a randomized study Methods: 180 consecutive patients were randomized in a prospective study to treat symptomatic superficial femoral stenosis, via RA, FA and PA. Primary endpoint: technical success, rate of major and minor access site complications. Secondary endpoints: major adverse events (MAE), procedural factors, cross-over rate, and duration of hospitalization. Result(s): Technical success was achieved in 96.6%, 100% and 100% patients in RA, FA and PA group (p=ns). Secondary access site was used in 30%, 3.3% and 30% in the RA, FA and PA access group (p<0.01). Stent implantation was done in the femoral artery in 26.6%, 58.3% and 71.6% cases in RA, FA and PA group (p<0.01). CTO recanalization was performed in 34/36 (100%), 30/30 (100%) and 45/45 (100%) cases successfully in RA, FA and PA group (p=ns). Contrast consumption, fluoroscopy and procedure time was not statistically different, but the X Ray dose was significantly lower in PA than in the RA and FA access group (63.1 vs 162 vs 153 Dyn). The cumulative rate of access site complications in the RA, FA and PA group was 3.3% (0% major and 3.3% minor), 15% (3.3% major and 11.6% minor) and 3.3% (0% major and 3.3% minor) (p<0.01), respectively. The cumulative incidence of MAE's at 6 months in the RA, FA and PA group was 8.3% vs 13.3% and 18.3%.

Visual acuity, complication data, and recurrence rates were recorded up to 120 months after brachytherapy., RESULTS: Median age at presentation was 63.0 years (range, 22-93). Median follow-up was 65.5 months (range, 2-180). Median radiation dose at the prescription point was 85.8 Gy (range, 51.8-103.7). Preservation of useful visual acuity, defined as better than 20/200, was noted in 43 of 74 (58%) of patients in the present study at 36 months compared with 50.1% of Collaborative Ocular Melanoma Study participants. By 120 months, 17 of 30 (57%; 95% confidence interval, 45-69%) progressed to visual acuity worse than 20/200, whereas 9 of 30 (30%) retained visual acuity of 20/40 or better, and 4 of 30 (13%) were 20/50-20/200. The rate of retinopathy after radiation was approximately 40% of all those observed by 60 months. Baseline visual acuity, apical tumor height, American Joint Committee on Cancer tumor category, and distance between the tumor and the fovea were all significantly associated with loss of visual acuity. The local tumor control rate by 60 months of follow-up was 93% (95% confidence interval, 85-97%)., CONCLUSIONS: The OSU-Nag custom (125)I plaque is an effective treatment for uveal melanoma, with preservation of useful visual acuity in 58% of eyes 3 years after treatment and 43% of eyes 10 years after treatment.

3396,"Radioiodine-Associated Exacerbation of Graves' Orbitopathy in the Japanese Population: Randomized Prospective Study CONTEXT: Exacerbation of Graves' orbitopathy (GO) after radioiodine (RAI) therapy has been examined in some populations but has not been fully described in Japanese populations., OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to clarify the characteristics of GO exacerbation after RAI therapy and the effectiveness of low-dose prophylactic corticosteroid (PCS)., DESIGN AND SETTING: This was a prospective randomized study in Tokyo, Japan., PATIENTS: Between June 2011 and June 2012, 295 patients with Graves' disease with either inactive GO or no GO received RAI therapy. Of these, 147 received no PCS (PCS-Off group), whereas 148 received low-dose PCS (starting dose, 15 mg/day of prednisolone) for 6 weeks (PCS-On group). We used magnetic resonance imaging to thoroughly evaluate GO before and 1 year after RAI therapy., MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Outcomes of GO 1 year after RAI therapy were determined., RESULTS: GO exacerbation occurred in 29 patients (9.8%), and only 7 patients (2.4%) required ophthalmic treatment. No significant difference in the frequency of GO exacerbation was seen between the groups (PCS-On group: n = 18 [12.1%]; PCS-Off group: n = 11 [7.5%]; P = .17). Significant prognostic factors were identified as thyroid-stimulating antibody (by 100% linear increase: risk ratio, 1.15; 95% confidence interval, 1.07-1.24; P = .0003) and clinical activity score (>=1 vs 0: risk ratio, 6.40; 95% confidence interval, 2.17-19.7; P = .0009)., CONCLUSION: Exacerbation of GO after RAI therapy in the Japanese population appears less common than in other populations. Low-dose PCS did not produce a significant preventive effect and appeared insufficient. Patients presenting with risk factors would thus be recommended to receive higher-dose PCS.",Excluded
3135,"Patterns of Care Study of radiation therapy for esophageal cancer in Japan: Influence of age on parameters of treatment Background. In Japan, the elderly population is growing rapidly, and therefore, so is the number of cancer patients who are not good candidates for aggressive surgery or chemotherapy. Radiation therapy offers excellent potential for the treatment of such patients, with minimal invasion and functional preservation. A Patterns of Care Study (PCS) examined the parameters of treatments used for patients with esophageal cancer to determine nationwide variations by age. Methods. From July 1996 through February 1997, external nationwide PCS audits were performed for 29 institutions. Medical charts were reviewed for 455 patients with thoracic esophageal cancer treated between 1992 and 1994. The parameters of treatments used for these patients were compared between those aged >=75 years (elderly; n = 113) and those aged <75 years (younger; n = 342). Results. Surgery was used in 49% of the younger group and in 17% of the elderly group (P < 0.0001) while chemotherapy was used in 48% of the younger and 24% of the older group (P < 0.0001). The ratio of non-surgery group with radiation therapy increased significantly from 49% to 82% (P < 0.0001). Approximately 70% of the non- surgery patients received an external radiation dose of more than 60 Gy, even in the elderly (P = 0.3001). Preliminary results showed no significant difference in survival between the two age groups (P = 0.5559). Conclusions. The use of radiation therapy in elderly people with esophageal cancer has increased markedly. The PCS provided important information about variations in radiotherapy parameters in patients with esophageal cancer in relation to age. Such information should be useful for future prospective studies of the elderly.",Excluded
510,"Changes in lateral dimensions of irradiated volume and their impact on the accuracy of dose delivery during radiotherapy for head and neck cancer BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: To assess changes in lateral dimensions of irradiated volume during head and neck cancer radiotherapy and to determine their impact on the accuracy of dose delivery., PATIENTS AND METHODS: Lateral dimensions of irradiated volumes were measured in five predefined points prior to treatment and then bi-weekly. For each measurement, midline dose was calculated and verified using in vivo dosimetry. Early radiation reactions, patient weight changes and the need to modify radiotherapy accessories were also recorded. The study included 33 head and neck cancer patients irradiated using parallel opposed megavoltage fields., RESULTS: Body mass changes during radiotherapy ranged from -18 to +4 kg (median -5). Lateral dimension changes >5 mm (range -37 to +16) occurred in 32 patients (97%). For axis measurements, the degree of lateral dimension changes were correlated with treatment field size (P = 0.022) and degree of mucositis (P = 0.017). Axis doses calculated for changed dimensions varied from those prescribed by -2.5 to +6% (median +2%). Differences larger than 5% were present in 4.8% of calculations. In 17 patients (52%), radiotherapy accessories had to be modified during treatment. The need to modify radiotherapy accessories correlated with larger treatment portals (P = 0.004), more weight loss during treatment (P = 0.01) and higher initial N stage (P = 0.04)., CONCLUSIONS: Changes of irradiated volume lateral dimensions during head and neck cancer radiotherapy may lead to considerable dose delivery inaccuracies. Watchful monitoring, corrections to calculated dose when changes observed are significant and radiotherapy accessories modification during the course of treatment are strongly recommended.",Excluded

3499,"A mouse radiation-induced liver disease model for stereotactic body radiation therapy validated in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma PURPOSE: Lower radiation tolerance of the whole liver hinders dose escalations of stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) treatment. This study was conducted to define the exact doses that result in radiation-induced liver disease (RILD) as well as to determine dose constraints for the critical organs at risk (OARs) in mice; these parameters are still undefined in HCC SBRT., METHODS: This study consisted of two phases. In the primary phase, mice treated with helical tomotherapy-based SBRT were stratified according to escalating radiation doses to the livers. The pathological differences, signs [such as mouse performance status (MPS)], and serum aspartate aminotransferase (AST)/alanine aminotransferase (ALT)/albumin levels were observed. Radiation-induced disease severities of the OARs were scored using systematic evaluation standards. In the validation phase in humans, 13 patients with HCC who had undergone radiotherapy before hepatectomy were enrolled to validate RILD pathological changes in a mouse study., RESULTS: The evaluation criteria of the mouse liver radiotherapy-related signs were as follows: MPS >= 2.0 +/- 0.52, AST/ALT >= 589.2 +/- 118.5/137.4 +/- 15.3 U/L, serum albumin <= 16.8 +/- 2.29 g/L. The preliminary dose constraints of the OARs were also obtained, such as those for the liver (average dose <= 26.36 +/- 1.71 Gy) and gastrointestinal tract (maximum dose <= 22.63 Gy). Mouse RILD models were able to be developed when the livers were irradiated with average doses of >=31.76 +/- 1.94 Gy (single fraction). RILD pathological changes in mice have also been validated in HCC patients., CONCLUSIONS: Mouse RILD models could be developed with SBRT based on the dose constraints for the OARs and evaluation criteria of mouse liver radiotherapy-related signs, and the authors' results favor the study of further approaches to treat HCC with SBRT.",Included
3246,"Stereotactic body radiotherapy of bone metastases in oligometastatic disease: Prognostic factors of oncologic outcomes Background: To evaluate the safety of stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) of bone metastases in oligometastatic disease and to investigate prognostic factors of local control (LC), progression/disease-free survival (PDFS), and overall survival (OS). Method(s): Eligibility criteria were number of metastates <=5, controlled primary tumor without evidence of progression under systemic therapy, exclusion of surgery, and no previous radiotherapy of the lesion of interest. Oligometastatic status was classified into only bone (BOD) and outside bone disease (OBOD), whereas SBRT was delivered to bone lesions using 2 different schedules: 24 Gy/1 fraction or 27 Gy/3 fractions. A positron emission tomography study of the lesion of interest was performed at baseline and at 3 months after SBRT to evaluate metabolic response according to European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) criteria. A Cox regression model was used for univariate and multivariate analysis. Result(s): Between January 2010 and December 2013, 40 patients were enrolled. Only 1 patient experienced severe late toxicity (radiation-related fracture). Local control was longer among responders' than nonresponders' lesions (94.2% and 91.2% versus 63% and 35% at 1 and 2 years, respectively) (p = 0.004; hazard ratio = 9.958). The multivariate analysis of PDFS showed a significant correlation with planning target volume (PTV) size (p = 0.003) and oligometastatic status (p = 0.002). The multivariate analysis of OS confirmed a statistically significant value of the oligometastatic status (p = 0.002) and a significant trend for PTV size (p = 0.065). Conclusion(s): Stereotactic body radiotherapy is safe with a low incidence of severe toxicity. Positron emission tomography response was a strong prognostic factor of LC whereas BOD status and small PTV size could identify a subset of oligometastatic patients at better prognosis.Copyright © 2015 INTM, Italy.",Excluded
1410,"Treatment results of alternating chemoradiotherapy followed by proton beam therapy boost combined with intra-arterial infusion chemotherapy for stage III-IVB tongue cancer Purpose: Proton beam therapy (PBT), compared with conventional radiotherapy, can deliver high-dose radiation to a tumor, while minimizing doses delivered to surrounding normal tissues. The better dose distribution of PBT may contribute to the improvement in local control rate and reduction in late adverse events. We evaluated therapeutic results and toxicities of PBT combined with selective intra-arterial infusion chemotherapy (PBT-IACT) in patients with stage III-IVB squamous cell carcinoma of the tongue. Material(s) and Method(s): After 2 systemic chemotherapy courses and whole-neck irradiation (36 Gy in 20 fractions), we administered concurrent chemoradiotherapy comprising PBT for the primary tumor [28.6-33 Gy(RBE) in 13-15 fractions] and for the metastatic neck lymph node [33-39.6 Gy(RBE) in 15-18 fractions] with weekly retrograde intra-arterial chemotherapy by continuous infusion of cisplatin with sodium thiosulfate. Result(s): Between February 2009 and September 2012, 33 patients were enrolled. The median follow-up duration was 43 months. The 3-year overall survival, progression-free survival, local control rate, and regional control rate for the neck were 87.0, 74.1, 86.6, and 83.9 %, respectively.

3651,"Possible involvement of the facial nucleus in regulation of respiration in rats The facial nucleus (FN) has been known as a motor nucleus to control the activity of the facial skeletal muscles by its efferent somatic motoneurons. Much less, however, is known about the non-motor control functions of its interneurons. The present study was designed to investigate if the interneurons of the FN participate in controlling rhythmic respiration in the sodium thiopental-anesthetized and vagotomized Sprague-Dawley rats with facial motoneurons retrogradely degenerated with techniques of electrical and chemical stimulation of the FN and extracellular recording of discharge of neurons in the FN. Single pulse stimulation (75-100 microA, 0.2 ms) of the FN during inspiration caused a transient restrain in phrenic discharge. Short train stimulation (75-100 microA, 0.2 ms, 100 Hz, 3-5 pulses) delivered during the early- or mid-term of inspiration augmented the inspiratory duration, but switched the inspiration off when delivered during the later stage of inspiration. Short train stimulation delivered during expiration prolonged the expiratory duration. Continuous stimulation could inhibit the inspiration. Microinjection of kainic acid into the FN caused an augmentation in inspiratory duration and amplitude and in expiratory duration. These data indicate that the interneurons of the FN might participate in the modulation of respiration. Different discharge patterns of interneurons in the FN, interestingly some respiratory related patterns, were observed, which provide a possible structural basis for the role of the FN in respiratory regulation.",Excluded
2401,"Estimating the incidence of leukemia attributable to occupational exposure in Iran Objective: The aim this study was to estimate the fraction of leukemia incidence in Iran attributable to occupational exposure to benzene, ionizing radiation, and ethylene oxide. Method(s): Nationwide exposure to each of these leukemogens was estimated using workforce data available at the ILO (International Labor Organization) website. The prevalence of exposure to leukemogens in each industry was estimated using exposure data from the CAREX (CARcinogen EXposure) database. The magnitude of the relative risk of leukemia for each leukemogen was from published literature. Using the Levin's population attributable risk (incidence), fractions of leukemia incidences attributed to workplace leukemogens were then estimated. Result(s): The total workforce in Iran according to the 1995 census included 12,488,020 men and 677,469 women. Agriculture was the largest sector with 24.5% of the males and 0.27% of the females, and the electricals-related sector was the smallest with 1.16% of the males and 0.66% of the females. After applying the CAREX exposure estimates to each sector, the proportion exposed to leukemogens was 0.016% for male workers and 0.02% for female workers. Estimating a relative risk of 3.6 (95% CI of 3.2-4.2) for high exposure and 1.9 (95% CI 1.7-2.1) for low exposure and employing the Levin's formula, the fraction of leukemia attributed to leukemogens in the workplaces among females was 3.6% (95% CI of 3.1-4.5) and among males was 7.6% (95% CI of 6.4-9.2). These fractions corresponded to estimated incidences of 0.60 (95% CI of 0.50-0.70) and 0.22 (95% CI of 0.16-0.23) cases of leukemia per 100,000 populations for males and females, respectively.

This paper aims to fill this gap with reference to the recovery process in Fukushima City following the 2011 Tohoku Earthquake Tsunami in Japan., METHODS: Open access data were sourced from the 2015 Social Survey on Living and Disaster Recovery (SSLDR) (N = 1439) of Fukushima citizens. Pearson's Chi-square Test and the t-test were employed to examine gender differences with regard to happiness and exploratory variables. Following this, a multiple linear regression analysis was conducted to investigate the determinants of happiness., RESULTS: The results showed that, compared to females, male respondents were unhappier and reported more property loss and less neighborhood connectedness. Individuals' mental and physical health and neighborhood connectedness were found to be significantly correlated with their happiness. However, the disaster-related variables of people's evaluation of recovery achievement, concerns around the health impacts of radiation, property loss in the disaster, and experiences of casualty, had no effects on happiness., CONCLUSION: These findings indicate that policies and countermeasures dealing with disaster recovery over the long term should continuously focus on health issues and social relationships.",Excluded
3085,"Recurrent Atypical Meningiomas: Combining Surgery and Radiosurgery in One Effective Multimodal Treatment Objective Owing to their rarity and proteiform pathologic features, the clinical behavior of atypical meningiomas is not yet well characterized. Though the extent of resection is believed to be a key determinant of prognosis, limited data exist regarding optimal management of patients with recurrent disease. Methods In this 20-year retrospective case series, we reviewed the medical records of 46 patients with recurrent atypical meningomas (185 lesions, 89 of which were local, 78 marginal, and 18 distant recurrences); treatment was radiosurgery (n = 60), surgery (n = 56), or both (n = 8). The median follow-up period was 53 months. Outcome measures were length of overall survival and disease-free intervals and prognostic factors for survival. Results Overall, the median progression-free survival was 26 months at the first recurrence and 100 months thereafter (the sum of the later intervals). Multivariate analysis showed that no treatment-related factors influenced prognosis, whereas recurrence at the skull base was a significant tumor-related factor limiting further treatment. Irrespective of treatment type, the recurrence-free interval was increasingly shorter during the clinical course, with a higher occurrence of marginal and distant lesions migrating to the midline and to the skull base. In sporadic cases, disease-free intervals were longer after wide craniotomy, tumor and dural resection with tumor-free margin. Conclusions The disease-free interval was substantially similar after surgery and radiosurgery for treating recurrent disease in patients with atypical meningiomas. Surgery is the mainstay for prolonging survival, while radiosurgery can be an adjuvant strategy to gain time for clinical observation and planning aggressive surgical treatment.Copyright © 2016 Elsevier Inc.

As a consequence, numerous incidental and unexpected findings may be detected on LDCT. Recognition of these findings and appropriate determination of their relevance can add to the utility of SPECT/CT. We aimed to evaluate the prevalence and categorise the relevance of incidental and unexpected findings on LDCT scans performed as part of routine SPECT/CT studies., METHODS: All available LDCT scans performed as part of SPECT/CT studies at St. Vincent's Hospital Melbourne in the year 2013 were retrospectively reviewed. Two qualified radiologists independently reviewed the studies and any previous available imaging and categorised any detected incidental findings., RESULTS: A total of 2447 LDCT studies were reviewed. The relevance of the findings was classified according to a modified version of a scale used in the Colonography Reporting and Data System: E1 = normal or normal variant (28.0%); E2 = clinically unimportant (63.5%); E3 = likely unimportant or incompletely characterised (6.2%); E4 = potentially important (2.5%)., CONCLUSION: Imaging specialists need to be cognisant of incidental and unexpected findings present on LDCT studies performed as part of SPECT/CT. Appropriate categorisation of findings and communication of potentially important findings to referring clinicians should form part of routine practice. The overall prevalence of potentially significant incidental and unexpected findings in our series was 8.7% (E3, 6.2%; E4, 2.5%) and was comparable to rates in other published imaging series.

For assessment, wound measurement was done before, during and after treatment and wound healing time as well as lab tests like swab culture, X-ray of affected part, Hemoglobin, Total Leucocytes Count, Differential Leucocytes Count, Liver Function Test, blood sugar level and HbA1c were recorded. Patients with tubercular, malignant ulcers and with ulcers of less than 6 weeks duration were excluded from the study. In the patients treated with only Nimba taila, 31.2% (5/16) patients had 50% healing at eight weeks therapy while with only Manjistha churna, 20.0% (3/15) patients had 50% healing at eight weeks therapy but in the cases, treated with both the drugs, 75.0% (15/20) patients had achieved 50% healing at eight weeks therapy. The study suggests that there is an added effect (quick healing of wound) of Nimba taila with Manjistha churna & its kwatha in cases of non healing diabetic ulcer and single use of Nimba taila or Manjistha churna is not much significant but it is observed keenly that use of Nimba taila alone is comparatively more beneficial than single use of Manjistha churna.

486,"Classification of benign and malignant breast lesions in ultrasound images using support vector machines One of the most common diseases prevalent among women is Breast cancer. In general, Mammography is applied for the detection of the breast cancer, whereas, the technique of Mammography makes use of the ionizing radiation. As a result, this technique does not detect the breast cancer in women having dense breast. In the beginning phases of malignancy, radiologist could experience the challenges in identifying the lesions. Hence, there is a need for one more screen test for the confirmation of the cancer. On the other hand, Sonography is also commonly used for the detection and classification of abnormalities of the breast owing to its cost-effectiveness, comfort level of patient, and non-ionizing radiation. Nevertheless, ultrasound images seem to be low contrast images as well as the physician could encounter the possible challenges in the identification of the lesions. Therefore, there has been an inevitable requirement in the development of Computer Aided Diagnosis (CAD) system for the purpose of classifying breast lesion in an accurate manner. This paper aims at the analyzing the Morphological and Fractal features in an effective manner for differentiating benign as well as malignant masses from ultrasound images.

588,"Validation of a decision instrument for selective chest imaging in blunt trauma IMPORTANCE Chest radiography (chest x-ray [CXR] and chest computed tomography [CT]) is the most common imaging in blunt trauma evaluation. Unnecessary trauma imaging leads to greater costs, emergency department time, and patient exposure to ionizing radiation. OBJECTIVE To validate our previously derived decision instrument (NEXUS Chest) for identification of blunt trauma patients with very low risk of thoracic injury seen on chest imaging (TICI).We hypothesized that NEXUS Chest would have high sensitivity (>98%) for the prediction of TICI and TICI with major clinical significance. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS From December 2009 to January 2012, we enrolled blunt trauma patients older than 14 years who received chest radiography in this prospective, observational, diagnostic decision instrument study at 9 US level I trauma centers. Prior to viewing radiographic results, physicians recorded the presence or absence of the NEXUS Chest 7 clinical criteria (age >60 years, rapid deceleration mechanism, chest pain, intoxication, abnormal alertness/mental status, distracting painful injury, and tenderness to chest wall palpation). MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Thoracic injury seen on chest imagingwas defined as pneumothorax, hemothorax, aortic or great vessel injury, 2 or more rib fractures, ruptured diaphragm, sternal fracture, and pulmonary contusion or laceration seen on radiographs. An expert panel generated an a priori classification of clinically major, minor, and insignificant TICIs according to associated management changes. RESULTS Of 9905 enrolled patients, 43.1%had a single CXR, 42.0% had CXR and chest CT, 6.7%had CXR and abdominal CT (without chest CT), 5.5%had multiple CXRs without CT, and 2.6%had chest CT alone in the emergency department. The most common trauma mechanisms were motorized vehicle crash (43.9%), fall (27.5%), pedestrian struck by motorized vehicle (10.7%), bicycle crash (6.3%), and struck by blunt object, fists, or kicked (5.8%). Thoracic injury seen on chest imaging was seen in 1478 (14.9%) patients with 363 (24.6%) of these having major clinical significance, 1079 (73.0%) minor clinical significance, and 36 (2.4%) no clinical significance. NEXUS Chest had a sensitivity of 98.8% (95%CI, 98.1%-99.3%), a negative predictive value of 98.5%(95%CI, 97.6%.6-99.1%), and a specificity of 13.3%(95%CI, 12.6%-14.1%) for TICI. The sensitivity and negative predictive value for TICI with clinically major injury were 99.7%(95%CI, 98.2%-100.0%) and 99.9% (95%CI, 99.4%-100.0%), respectively. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE We have validated the NEXUS Chest decision instrument, which may safely reduce the need for chest imaging in blunt trauma patients older than 14 years.",Excluded

900,"Seesaw-Like Cervical Ossification of Posterior Longitudinal Ligament Ossification of posterior longitudinal ligament (OPLL) is a pathological process in which lamellar bone is deposited at the posterior longitudinal ligament and can lead to a limited range of cervical motion and spinal cord compression. A 64-year-old man presented with a 10-month history of worsening clumsiness in the hands and impaired gait, and he occasionally had a feeling of an electric shock in the limbs when the neck was flexed. Physical examination revealed atrophy of the intrinsic hand muscles, rapid reflexes in the lower extremities, and positive Hoffman sign and Babinski sign results. Seesaw-like OPLL was observed on hyperextension and hyperflexion x-rays, which also showed that the OPLL involved the spinal canal; laminoplasty and laminectomy were not recommended for this specific type of OPLL, even though the K-line was positive on both x-rays.Copyright © 2021 Elsevier Inc.",Excluded
2853,"Fast-neutron irradiation of glioblastoma multiforme. Neuropathological analysis Various modes of therapy, alone or in combination, have had little effect in improving the survival of patients with glioblastoma multiforme. Recently, in a pilot study, 34 patients with glioblastoma were treated by fast-neutron-beam irradiation of the whole brain. Following treatment, the patients became steroid-dependent and pursued a gradual downhill course with increasing obtundation. Although there was no improvement in the length or quality of survival of these patients, neuropathological studies in the 13 patients who came to autopsy showed the following: 1) extensive coagulative necrosis of much of the tumor mass; 2) dense infiltration by collagenous connective tissue; 3) minimal phagocytic reaction; 4) marked reduction in the amount of viable tumor; 5) abnormal astrocytic proliferation, which may represent either astrocytoma or a radiation-induced bizarre gliosis, and 6) areas of gliosis and white matter degeneration in the brain stem, remote form the tumor site. These observations suggest that continued efforts to further refine this mode of therapy for glioblastoma are warranted.",Excluded
1211,"Ischaemic heart disease incidence and mortality in an extended cohort of Mayak workers first employed in 1948-1982 Objective: Incidence and mortality from ischaemic heart disease (IHD) was studied in an extended cohort of 22,377 workers first employed at the Mayak Production Association during 1948-82 and followed up to the end of 2008. Method(s): Relative risks and excess relative risks per unit dose (ERR/Gy) were calculated based on the maximum likelihood using Epicure software (Hirosoft International Corporation, Seattle, WA). Dose estimates used in analyses were provided by an updated ""Mayak Worker Dosimetry System-2008"". Result(s): A significant increasing linear trend in IHD incidence with total dose from external g-rays was observed after having adjusted for non-radiation factors and dose from internal radiation {ERR/Gy50.10 [95% confidence interval (CI): 0.04 to 0.17]}. The pure quadratic model provided a better fit of the data than did the linear one. No significant association of IHD mortality with total dose from external g-rays after having adjusted for nonradiation factors and dose from internal alpha radiation was observed in the study cohort [ERR/Gy50.06 (95% CI: ,0 to 0.15)]. A significant increasing linear trend was observed in IHD mortality with total absorbed dose from internal alpha radiation to the liver after having adjusted for non-radiation factors and dose from external g-rays in both the whole cohort [ERR/Gy50.21 (95% CI: 0.01 to 0.58)] and the subcohort of workers exposed at alpha dose ,1.00Gy [ERR/Gy51.08 (95% CI: 0.34 to 2.15)]. No association of IHD incidence with total dose from internal alpha radiation to the liver was found in the whole cohort after having adjusted for non-radiation factors and external gamma dose [ERR/Gy50.02 (95% CI: not available to 0.10)]. Statistically significant dose effect was revealed in the subcohort of workers exposed to internal alpha radiation at dose to the liver ,1.00Gy [ERR/Gy50.44 (95% CI: 0.09 to 0.85)]. Conclusion(s): This study provides strong evidence of IHD incidence and mortality association with external g-ray exposure and some evidence of IHDincidence andmortality association with internal alpha-radiation exposure. Advances in knowledge: It is the first time the validity of internal radiation dose estimates has been shown to affect the risk of IHD incidence.Copyright © The Authors Publised by the British Institute of Radiology.",Included
321,"Longstanding symptomatic choroidal hemangioma managed with limited PDT as initial or salvage therapy Purpose: To describe the use of limited, low-irradiance, single-spot photodynamic therapy (PDT) with verteporfin for the treatment of symptomatic choroidal hemangiomas. Method(s): Thirteen consecutive patients with a circumscribed choroidal hemangioma were treated with limited PDT 6 min following a 1-min infusion with verteporfin (6 mg/m2 body surface area), using a diode laser (692 nm) and a single spot large enough to cover only the most prominent part of the tumor. Exposure time was 166 s in the first three patients and 83 s in the last ten patients, resulting in a radiance exposure of respectively 100 and 50 J/cm2. Result(s): In all 11 not previously conventionally treated patients, visual acuity improved following PDT treatment. The two remaining patients with prior radiation treatment both reported widening of the visual field and sharper vision, but did not show an increase in ETDRS vision. In all but four patients the tumor became ultrasonographically undetectable by the first follow-up visit at 6 weeks, with only a slight irregularity at the level of the previous tumor remaining. In four patients the residual tumor was still detectable, and they received a second treatment, following which the tumor flattened completely. In all patients the retinal detachment disappeared. Conclusion(s): The present series demonstrates that even limited, low-irradiance, single-spot photodynamic therapy with verteporfin is an effective first-line treatment for choroidal hemangiomas.",Excluded
1017,"Decreasing radiation doses in digital subtraction angiographies consecutively performed by trainees Digital subtraction angiography (DSA) performed by trainees may be related to increased radiation exposure. This study was aimed to investigate and quantify this learning effect, with fluoroscopy time and dose-area product (DAP) as parameters. We collected procedure data of the first to the fortieth cerebral DSA consecutively performed by 13 trainees in a training centre. DAP, procedure time, fluoroscopy time, number of cine-frames of the first 20 DSA procedures performed by these trainees were compared with that of the second 20 procedures. There was no significant difference concerning the procedure time between the first and the second 20 procedures (56.3 +/- 29.5 vs 51.5 +/- 20.2 min, p = 0.113). Numbers of cine-frames were very similar between the first and the second 20 procedures (750.7 +/- 290.3 vs 744.5 +/- 188.7, p = 0.830). Fluoroscopy time of the first 20 procedures was significantly longer than that of the second 20 procedures (17.8 +/- 15.4 vs 12.6 +/- 9.0, p = 0.001). DAP of the first 20 procedures was significantly higher than that of the second 20 procedures (6.4 +/- 4.9 vs 3.8 +/- 1.8, p < 0.001). DAP was correlated significantly with the performer's experience (R = -0.288, p < 0.001). There exists a learning effect of radiation exposure during cerebral DSA procedures performed by trainees. The learning effect is significant during the first 20 procedures, and becomes insignificant after 20 procedures. Insufficient catheter skills in novice trainees may be one reason for this effect. © The Author 2011. Published by Oxford University Press. All rights reserved.",Excluded
2829,"Rhegmatogenous Retinal Detachment and Solar Radiation in Northwestern Spain OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to investigate the association between rhegmatogenous retinal detachment (RRD) and solar radiation in northwestern Spain., METHODS: All RRD cases in Pontevedra from 2008 and 2014 were retrospectively analyzed. Climatological data from 4 weather stations in the area were collected. The association between RRD incidence and solar radiation was investigated., RESULTS: A total of 256 RRD cases were identified. There was a seasonal variation in the incidence of RRD with a maximum number of incident cases observed in June and July and a minimum number of cases observed in January and December. An association was found between RRD incidence and solar radiation both monthly (p = 0.004) and bimonthly (p = 0.057). The right eye was more frequently affected than the left eye (p = 0.035). RD cases other than rhegmatogenous showed neither seasonality nor association with radiation., CONCLUSIONS: Solar radiation may play a role in RRD genesis in our area. Laterality could be related to the amount of radiation reaching each eye. Copyright © 2019 S. Karger AG, Basel.",Excluded
3399,"An exploratory study of the relation of population density and agricultural activity to hematologic malignancies in North Dakota Introduction: Established risk factors for hematologic cancers include exposure to ionizing radiation, organic solvents, and genetic mutation; however, the potential roles of environmental and sociological factors are not well explored. As North Dakota engages in significant agricultural activity, the present investigation seeks to determine whether an association exists between the incidence of hematologic cancers and either population density or agricultural occupation for residents of south central North Dakota. Method(s): The present study is a retrospective analysis. Cases of hematologic malignancies and associated pre-malignant conditions were collected from the regional Central North Dakota Cancer Registry, and analysis of study-specific demographic factors was performed. Result(s): Significantly higher incidence of hematologic cancers and pre-malignant disorders was associated with residence in an ""urban"" county and rural city/town. Within the latter designation, there was a higher rate of self-reported agricultural occupation (40% vs 10%, P < 0.0001). Conclusion(s): The increased incidence of hematologic cancer in low population density areas of south central North Dakota supports the need for more detailed prospective research centered on agricultural exposures.",Excluded
1168,"Damage-induced apoptosis in primary human lymphocytes is a genetic program modified by gender and age Apoptosis is a core pathway deregulated in hematologic and other cancers. Although there are considerable functional and genetic data on the regulation of apoptosis in vitro and in model organisms, little is known about how these pathways are modified in primary cells freshly isolated from people, who are continually subjected to a variety of different and often unquantified environmental stimuli. We hypothesize that these exposures may have important and as yet unappreciated modifying effects on apoptosis that may have implications for cancer risk or response to therapy. To test this, we isolated peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from 90 normal healthy individuals and treated them with 5 Gy ionizing radiation (IR). Damage-induced apoptosis was measured at 24 hours after IR by TUNEL. We observed surprising heterogeneity in apoptosis among individuals, ranging from 21-65 percent. To determine whether this diversity in response was programmed or stochastic, we repeated the experiment 3 times in 10 individuals spanning the entire IR-induced apoptotic range and found results to be completely reproducible within individuals, suggesting that it resulted from a genetic program. We then assessed the association with individual characteristics. Whereas neither race nor age was associated with IR-induced apoptosis, gender was significantly associated (Mean: 44.8% vs 32.9%; p = 1.02 x 10-8). Moreover, when stratified by gender, age was significantly associated with IR-induced apoptosis in males (p = 0.026) but not females (p = 0.94). Thus, we conclude that IR-induced apoptosis in freshly isolated human PBMCs results from an intrinsic genetic program modified by age, but only within males. Genetic models to explain this will be discussed.",Included
1089,"Predictors and clinical significance of local recurrence in extremity soft tissue sarcoma Background. Limb salvage surgery (LSS) has gained widespread acceptance as the current treatment for treating extremity soft tissue sarcoma (STS) and has been greatly refined since its inception. Combined with improved adjuvant treatment modalities, rates of local relapse have greatly decreased. Nonetheless, local recurrence still occurs and identifying the cause and the subsequent effects of local recurrence can provide valuable insights as LSS continues to evolve. Methods. This retrospective study evaluated 278 patients treated for STS of the extremities between 2000 and 2006. Of these, 41 patients developed a local recurrence while 247 did not. Tumor characteristics and prognostic outcomes were analyzed. Wilcoxon rank sum test and either chi or Fisher's exact was used to compare variables. Kaplan Meier and Gray's test for cumulative risk were also performed. Results. Patients who had a positive margin were 3.76 times more likely to develop local recurrence when compared to those with negative margins. This corresponds to a 38% risk of local recurrence if the margins were positive after six years vs. 12% if the margins were negative. In patients who underwent a re-excision, the presence or absence of residual disease upon re-excision did not have any bearing on local recurrence (p =0.27). In comparing patients with and without local recurrence, there was no statistically significant difference in the rate and the proportion encountering distant metastasis and death due to sarcoma (p >0.05). Conclusions. Despite advancements in surgery, radiation and imaging, positive margins still occur, and the presence of positive margins following definitive treatment continues to remain as a strong predictor for local recurrence. While local recurrence represents a negative outcome for a patient, its impact on future prognosis is influenced by a variety of factors such as time to local recurrence as well as the tumor's inherent biological characteristics. © 2013 Informa Healthcare.",Excluded
3459,"Raw data-based iterative reconstruction in body CTA: evaluation of radiation dose saving potential OBJECTIVE: To evaluate prospectively, in patients undergoing body CTA, the radiation dose saving potential of raw data-based iterative reconstruction as compared to filtered back projection (FBP)., METHODS: Twenty-five patients underwent thoraco-abdominal CTA with 128-slice dual-source CT, operating both tubes at 120 kV. Full-dose (FD) images were reconstructed with FBP and were compared to half-dose (HD) images with FBP and HD-images with sinogram-affirmed iterative reconstruction (SAFIRE), both reconstructed using data from only one tube-detector-system. Image quality and sharpness of the aortic contour were assessed. Vessel attenuation and noise were measured, contrast-to-noise-ratio was calculated., RESULTS: Noise as image quality deteriorating artefact occurred in 24/25 (96%) HD-FBP but not in FD-FBP and HD-raw data-based iterative reconstruction datasets (p < 0.001). Other artefacts occurred with similar prevalence among the datasets. Sharpness of the aortic contour was higher for FD-FBP and HD-raw data-based iterative reconstruction as compared to HD-FBP (p < 0.001). Aortoiliac attenuation was similar among all datasets (p > 0.05). Lowest noise was found for HD-raw data-based iterative reconstruction (7.23HU), being 9.4% lower than that in FD-FBP (7.98HU, p < 0.05) and 30.8% lower than in HD-FBP images (10.44HU, p < 0.001). Contrast-to-noise-ratio was lower in HD-FBP (p < 0.001) and higher in HD-raw data-based iterative reconstruction (p < 0.001) as compared to FD-FBP., CONCLUSION: Intra-individual comparisons of image quality of body CTA suggest that raw data-based iterative reconstruction allows for dose reduction >50% while maintaining image quality. Key Points * Raw data-based iterative reconstruction reduces image noise and improves image quality as compared to filtered back projection * At a similar radiation dose, raw data-based iterative reconstruction improves the sharpness of vessel contours * In body CTA a dose reduction of >50% might be possible when using raw data-based iterative reconstructions, while image quality can be maintained.",Excluded
1254,"[Prospective double-blind study of prophylaxis of radioxerostomia with Coumarin/Troxerutine in patients with head and neck cancer] AIM: Prospective, randomized placebo-controlled double-blind study to prove the efficacy of Coumarin/Troxerutine (Venalot Depot) for protection of salivary glands during a head and neck irradiation., PATIENTS AND METHOD: Forty-eight radiotherapy patients (60 Gy) with head and neck cancer were included in this trial. During radiotherapy the salivary glands were located in the core irradiation field. Primary efficacy parameters were sialometry, quantitative salivary gland scintigraphy and clinical evaluation of early effects of radiotherapy (RTOG-score, Table 1). All data were collected at 6 assessments: 1 week pre-radiation (U1), at start (U2), half time (U3) and end (U4) of irradiation, 8 days (U5) and 28 days (U6) after the end of irradiation (Figure 1)., RESULTS: Twenty-three patients (11 verum, 12 placebo) completed the study with all assessments. Sialometrically, all patients were severely (half of radiotherapy) or completely (end of radiotherapy) xerostomatic (Figure 2). In a global efficacy measure according to O'Brien combining scintigraphy and RTOG there was a tendency for a higher efficacy of verum compared to placebo (p = 0.068). After start of irradiation therapy, the RTOG-score showed continuously and significantly lower early radiation effects under verum than under placebo (U3 vs U6: p < 0.05, area under curve: p = 0.032; Table 2, Figure 3). The scintigraphically determined excretion fraction was slightly less impaired in the verum group compared to the placebo treatment (p = 0.12. Figure 4). There was no difference in drug safety between placebo and verum for adverse events, changes in the activity of liver enzymes and for global impression of tolerability., CONCLUSIONS: The results give support for an advantageous effect of Venalot Depot in the treatment of radiogenic sialadenitis and mucositis. In even a small number of evaluable patients, early clinical effects of irradiation (RTOG-score) were less pronounced in the active treatment group than in the placebo group, but the sample size was too low to prove statistically also the benefit of coumarin/troxerutine with the scintigraphic method.

All patients had CBCT and sonographic imaging and received sialendoscopy to confirm and possibly treat sialolithiasis., RESULTS: Sonography, CBCT, and sialendoscopy together indicated sialolithiasis in 33 patients. The mean maximum diameter of the extracted sialoliths did not significantly differ between the three diagnostics. Each diagnostic tool showed an excellent specificity and positive predictive value. Sensitivity and negative predictive value were best in sialendoscopy (94% resp. 83%), followed by CBCT (79% resp. 56%) and then sonography (70% resp. 47%)., CONCLUSION: The results revealed that CBCT is capable of diagnosing sialoliths in general and tended to be more sensitive than sonography. However, in view of the radiation exposure, the use of CBCT must be critically weighed and should not be used as a primary option., LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: 4.

1512,"Hypoxia-inducible factor pathway inhibition resolves tumor hypoxia and improves local tumor control after single-dose irradiation Purpose To study the effects of BAY-84-7296, a novel orally bioavailable inhibitor of mitochondrial complex I and hypoxia-inducible factor 1 (HIF-1) activity, on hypoxia, microenvironment, and radiation response of tumors. Methods and Materials UT-SCC-5 and UT-SCC-14 human squamous cell carcinomas were transplanted subcutaneously in nude mice. When tumors reached 4 mm in diameter BAY-84-7296 (Bayer Pharma AG) or carrier was daily administered to the animals. At 7 mm tumors were either excised for Western blot and immunohistologic investigations or were irradiated with single doses. After irradiation animals were randomized to receive BAY-84-7296 maintenance or carrier. Local tumor control was evaluated 150 days after irradiation, and the dose to control 50% of tumors (TCD50) was calculated. Results BAY-84-7296 decreased nuclear HIF-1alpha expression. Daily administration of inhibitor for approximately 2 weeks resulted in a marked decrease of pimonidazole hypoxic fraction in UT-SCC-5 (0.5% vs 21%, P<.0001) and in UT-SCC-14 (0.3% vs 19%, P<.0001). This decrease was accompanied by a significant increase in fraction of perfused vessels in UT-SCC-14 but not in UT-SCC-5. Bromodeoxyuridine and Ki67 labeling indices were significantly reduced only in UT-SCC-5. No significant changes were observed in vascular area or necrosis. BAY-84-7296 before single-dose irradiation significantly decreased TCD50, with an enhancement ratio of 1.37 (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.13-1.72) in UT-SCC-5 and of 1.55 (95% CI 1.26-1.94) in UT-SCC-14. BAY-84-7296 maintenance after irradiation did not further decrease TCD50. Conclusions BAY-84-7296 resulted in a marked decrease in tumor hypoxia and substantially reduced radioresistance of tumor cells with the capacity to cause a local recurrence after irradiation. The data suggest that reduction of cellular hypoxia tolerance by BAY-84-7296 may represent the primary biological mechanism underlying the observed enhancement of radiation response. Whether this mechanism contributes to the improved outcome of fractionated chemoradiation therapy warrants further investigation. © 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.",Excluded

Patients were implanted with either the SeeLens MF IOL or the SN6AD1 IOL. Postoperative straylight values, visual acuity, and refractive outcomes were compared., RESULTS: The SeeLens MF IOL was implanted in 84 eyes and the SN6AD1 IOL in 79 eyes. The difference in straylight was 0.08 (P = .01), with the SeeLens MF IOL having less straylight. Postoperative CDVA was logMAR -0.03 +/- 0.06 in the SeeLens MF group, and logMAR -0.02 +/- 0.08 in the SN6AD1 group.

The 10 lymphoma lines included 7 previously characterized and reported in the literature. Significant differences with respect to both latency period for tumor appearance and success rate for tumor transplantation were detected among the 3 experimental groups. The unmanipulated mice were poor recipients for lymphoma heterotranplants, and tumors were produced in only two instances. In contrast, 6 tumor lines were successfully transplanted in mice inoculated with ALS, and all 10 lines were successfully transplanted in X-irradiated recipients. Although tumors were readily produced in ALS-treated and X-irradiated mice, no gross or histologic evidence of focal or distant metastases was apparent. Human lymphoblastoid cells were recultured, essentially unchanged, from the heterotransplants from 6 of 7 tumors tested. Although the tumor line HT 1460, originally from a human lymphoma, was successfully transplanted in all 3 groups, only mouse cells were recultured. The use of X-irradiation, rather than ALS, to immunosuppress nude mice offers a more standardized method for heterotransplanting human tumor cell lines and permits ready comparisons between laboratories. Furthermore X-radiation permits transplantation and subsequent study of lymphoblastoid tumors that are otherwise difficult to successfully transplant in nude mice.",Included
2439,"Absence of radiographic progression of hip arthritis during infliximab treatment for ankylosing spondylitis This study aims to examine the impact of long-term treatment with the anti-TNF antibody infliximab on radiographic progression of hip arthritis in ankylosing spondylitis. Anteroposterior X-rays of the pelvis obtained at baseline from consecutive patients with ankylosing spondylitis and bilateral hip arthritis were compared with X-rays obtained after 6 +/- 2.5 years (mean +/- SD) of continuous infliximab treatment. Analysis was performed by the Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Radiology Hip Index (BASRI-h) scoring system (min 0, max 4). Hip joint space width was also assessed by the average of measurements at three distinct sites between the acetabulum and femoral head. In 23 patients with active disease (21 men, mean age and disease duration of 45 and 16 years, respectively), the BASRI-h score at baseline was 1 in 7, 2 in 16, 3 in 16, and 4 in 7 hips (including two arthroplasties). Individual BASRI-h scores at baseline (2.50 +/- 0.86, mean +/- SD) remained unchanged in all patients at end of follow-up. At baseline, the average width of the whole joint space (3.56 +/- 0.70 mm, n = 44) was not associated with disease activity measurements but negatively correlated with BAS functional index (Spearman r = -0.5, P = 0.007). After 2-10 years of infliximab treatment, the average width of the whole joint space in these patients (3.59 +/- 0.79 mm) was not reduced. These results suggest that radiographic progression of hip arthritis in ankylosing spondylitis may be arrested during infliximab treatment.",Excluded

Progesterone receptor immunoreactivity was detected in 70% of tumors. Estrogen receptor immunoreactivity was not detected. An inverse correlation was found between detection of progesterone receptors and the PFPCNA index. The overall 2-year progression-free survival (PFS) rate was 68%. The only prognostic factor that significantly affected PFS rate was the PFPCNA index. The 2-year PFS was 42% for tumors with a high PFPCNA index (value > or = 24%) and 91% for tumors with a low PFPCNA index (value < 24%). Tumors with a high PFPCNA index were 9.1 times as likely to recur as were tumors with a low PFPCNA index., CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE: This study confirms the value of irradiation for dogs with incompletely resected meningiomas. Prognostic value of the PFPCNA index suggests-that duration of treatment and interval from surgery to start of irradiation may affect outcome. Loss of progesterone receptors in some tumors may be responsible for an increase in PFPCNA index and may indirectly affect prognosis after radiation therapy.",Included
1416,"Single- and dual-energy CT of the abdomen: comparison of radiation dose and image quality of 2nd and 3rd generation dual-source CT Objectives: To compare single-energy (SECT) and dual-energy (DECT) abdominal CT examinations in matched patient cohorts regarding differences in radiation dose and image quality performed with second- and third-generation dual-source CT (DSCT). Method(s): We retrospectively analysed 200 patients (100 male, 100 female; mean age 61.2 +/- 13.5 years, mean body mass index 27.5 +/- 3.8 kg/m2) equally divided into four groups matched by gender and body mass index, who had undergone portal venous phase abdominal CT with second-generation (group A, 120-kV-SECT; group B, 80/140-kV-DECT) and third-generation DSCT (group C, 100-kV-SECT; group D, 90/150-kV-DECT). The radiation dose was normalised for 40-cm scan length. Dose-independent figure-of-merit (FOM) contrast-to-noise ratios (CNRs) were calculated for various organs and vessels. Subjective overall image quality and reader confidence were assessed. Result(s): The effective normalised radiation dose was significantly lower (P < 0.001) in groups C (6.2 +/- 2.0 mSv) and D (5.3 +/- 1.9 mSv, P = 0.103) compared to groups A (8.8 +/- 2.3 mSv) and B (9.7 +/- 2.4 mSv, P = 0.102). Dose-independent FOM-CNR peaked for liver, kidney, and portal vein measurements (all P <= 0.0285) in group D. Subjective image quality and reader confidence were consistently rated as excellent in all groups (all >=1.53 out of 5). Conclusion(s): With both DSCT generations, abdominal DECT can be routinely performed without radiation dose penalty compared to SECT, while third-generation DSCT shows improved dose efficiency. Key Points: * Dual-source CT (DSCT) allows for single- and dual-energy image acquisition. * Dual-energy acquisition does not increase the radiation dose in abdominal DSCT. * Third-generation DSCT shows improved dose efficiency compared to second-generation DSCT. * Dose-independent figure-of-merit image contrast was highest with third-generation dual-energy DSCT. * Third-generation DSCT shows improved dose efficiency for SECT and DECT.Copyright © 2016, European Society of Radiology.",Excluded
1116,"Effectiveness of Positron Emission Tomography/Computed Tomography as a Guide for Palliative Radiation Therapy for Spinal Metastases Objective: As back pain is the presenting symptom in 95% of patients with epidural spinal metastases, appropriately identifying and treating the most symptomatic levels can provide significant palliation. The purpose of this study was to analyze the ability of combined positron emission tomography (PET)/computed tomography (CT) to identify spinal metastases with high metabolic activity and guide radiotherapy. We sought to correlate improvement in back pain with reduction in standard uptake value (SUV) after treatment. Method(s): Retrospective review was performed of 72 patients with spinal metastases treated with stereotactic ablative radiation therapy at a single center between 2002 and 2014. PET/CT was used to calculate SUVs for spinal metastases, and treatment planning was based on PET/CT results. Preoperative and postoperative pain levels were assessed in all patients. Result(s): Reduction in pain scores was found in 78% of treated patients. A significant reduction in pain was identified in patients with >5 metastases compared with fewer lesions (P < 0.05). Degree of change in SUV did not correlate significantly with pain relief. However, comparing pretreatment and posttreatment PET/CT, patients with improved pain consistently displayed decreased SUV. Conclusion(s): PET/CT was shown to be a useful adjunct in radiation treatment planning with change in SUV correlating with symptomatic improvement. This study paves the way for future prospective studies to further assess utility and cost-effectiveness of this imaging modality in radiation treatment planning for spinal metastases.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.",Excluded
271,"Increased lung cancer risk due to residential radon in a pooled and extended analysis of studies in Germany Residential radon has been shown to be a risk factor for lung cancer in several studies-but with limited power in each single study. The data of two case-control studies performed during 1990-1997 in Germany and used for previous publications have been extended and pooled. Both studies have identical study designs. In total, data of 2,963 incident lung cancer cases and 4,232 population controls are analyzed here. One-year radon measurements were performed in houses occupied during the 5-35 y prior to the interview. Conditional logistic and linear relative risk regression was used for the analysis. Measurements covered on average 70% of the exposure time window, with an average radon exposure of 61 Bq m(-3). The smoking and asbestos-adjusted ORs were 0.97 [95% confidence interval (CI) 0.85 to 1.11] for 50-80 Bq m(-3), 1.06 (95% CI 0.87 to 1.30) for 80-140 Bq m(-3) and 1.40 (95% CI 1.03 to 1.89) for radon concentrations above 140 Bq m(-3), compared to the reference category <50 Bq m(-3). The linear increase in the odds ratio per 100 Bq m(-3) was 0.10 (95% CI -0.02 to 0.30) for all subjects and 0.14 (95% CI -0.03 to 0.55) for less mobile subjects who lived in only one home in the last 5-35 y. The risk coefficients generally were higher when measurement error in the radon concentrations was reduced by restricting the population. With respect to histopathology, the risk for small cell carcinoma was higher than for other subtypes. This analysis strengthens the evidence that residential radon is a relevant risk factor for lung cancer.",Included
1899,"Adjuvant Radiation and Chemoradiation for High-Risk Salivary Gland Malignancies: A 20-Year Single Institution Experience Purpose/Objective(s): To report our institutional outcomes of patients with non-previously treated, high-risk salivary gland malignancies treated with surgery followed by adjuvant radiation (RT) and chemoradiation (CRT). Materials/Methods: From January 1997 to December 2017, 108 patients were treated with surgery, and adjuvant RT (n = 50) or CRT (n = 58) for high-risk pathologic features: perineural involvement (PNI), lymphovascular space invasion (LVSI), positive/close (<2mm) margin, high grade, extracapsular extension (ECE), or positive lymph nodes. Adjuvant RT was delivered in 2 Gy daily fractions, and adjuvant CRT was delivered for 4-6 alternating week cycles: the most common regimen, TFHX, consisted of 5 days paclitaxel (100 mg/m2 on d1), infusional 5-fluorouracil (600 mg/m2/d x 5d), hydroxyurea (500 mg PO BID), and 1.5 Gy twice daily irradiation followed by a 9-day break without treatment. The Kaplan-Meier method was used to estimate rates of locoregional control (LRC), disease-free survival (DFS), and overall survival (OS). Regression analyses were used to identify factors associated with LRC, DFS, and OS. Multivariable Cox Regression (MVA) was performed for known confounding risk factors, and factors associated with a trend to significance (p <0.20). Chi-Square was used to compare rates of toxicities between groups. Result(s): Median follow-up was 52 months (range: 3 - 226). The most common histologies included: Adenoid Cystic (n = 30), Mucoepidermoid (n = 20), and Salivary Duct Adenocarcinoma (n = 18). The most common location included the parotid (n = 73). The median RT dose was 66 Gy (range 43.2 - 74 Gy). The 5-year LRC was 88%, 5-year DFS was 57%, and 5-year OS was 78%. On MVA, LRC was not associated with any factors; DFS was associated with the size of the tumor (HR 2.0, p = 0.01), tumor location (HR 2.0, p = 0.01), and stage (HR 1.7, p = 0.02); and OS was associated with N stage (HR 2.3, p = 0.005), LVSI (HR 1.9, p = 0.012), ECE (HR 1.5, p = 0.032), and stage (HR 1.3, p = 0.05). CRT was not associated with improved LRC (HR 0.5, p = 0.34), DFS (HR 0.4, p = 0.44), or OS (HR: 0.46, p = 0.384). Since 87% of node positive patients were treated with adjuvant CRT compared to 13% with RT, therefore comparison was not possible. There was no difference in any acute or late grade 3+ toxicities, or parenteral nutrition between RT and CRT (p = 0.98, p = 0.85, and p = 0.83), respectively. There was one acute grade 5 toxicity in the RT group. Conclusion(s): To our knowledge, this is the largest single institution cohort of adjuvant CRT for high-risk salivary malignancies. Overall, adjuvant CRT doesn't enhance outcomes compared to adjuvant RT alone. However, LRC was similar between RT and CRT groups in spite of more adverse features (nodal disease and ECE) in the CRT group. Distant metastatic disease remains a significant pattern of failure. We await large prospective evidence to determine which subsets of patients benefit from adjuvant CRT.Copyright © 2019",Excluded
2976,"[ERCP procedures as a source of radiation risk to a single gastroenterologist] BACKGROUND: One of the numerous sub-areas of interventional radiology is the use of X-rays in gastroenterology. X-ray fluoroscopy is applied in therapeutic procedures, including endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) that is frequently performed. The ERCP procedure is aimed at imaging the pancreatic duct and biliary tracts., MATERIAL AND METHODS: In this paper radiation risk to the gastrenterologist performing ERCP procedures was investigated. The procedures were performed by a single gastroenterologist in the ERCP Laboratory, University Clinical Hospital Military Memorial Medical Academy - Central Veterans' Hospital in Lodz, Poland. The study comprised 2 series of measurements, one taken during the procedures with continuous fluoroscopy mode, the other during procedures with fluoroscopy in pulsed mode at a frequency of 3 pulses/s. Exposure parameters, anatomical data of patient and dose equivalents for the eyes, skin of the hand and the effective dose for whole body of the gastroenterologist were recorded during each procedure., RESULTS: The collected data cover 70 ERCP procedures - 40 procedures were controlled by continuous fluoroscopy and 30 by pulsed fluoroscopy. The results reveal that pulsed fluoroscopy makes it possible to reduce doses received by the gastroeneterologist from 45% to 60% compared to continuous fluoroscopy., CONCLUSIONS: Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography procedures can cause radiation risk to the gastroenterologist performing them. The use of continuous fluoroscopy can result in achieving an equivalent dose to eye lens nearly 20 mSv per year, i.e., the decreased annual limit recommended by the International Commission on Radiological Protection (ICRP).

2514,"Estimation of background radiation doses for the Peninsular Malaysia's population by ESR dosimetry of tooth enamel Background radiation dose is used in dosimetry for estimating occupational doses of radiation workers or determining radiation dose of an individual following accidental exposure. In the present study, the absorbed dose and the background radiation level are determined using the electron spin resonance (ESR) method on tooth samples. The effect of using different tooth surfaces and teeth exposed with single medical X-rays on the absorbed dose are also evaluated. A total of 48 molars of position 6-8 were collected from 13 district hospitals in Peninsular Malaysia. Thirty-six teeth had not been exposed to any excessive radiation, and 12 teeth had been directly exposed to a single X-ray dose during medical treatment prior to extraction. There was no significant effect of tooth surfaces and exposure with single X-rays on the measured absorbed dose of an individual. The mean measured absorbed dose of the population is 34 +/- 6.2 mGy, with an average tooth enamel age of 39 years. From the slope of a regression line, the estimated annual background dose for Peninsular Malaysia is 0.6 +/- 0.3 mGy y(-1). This value is slightly lower than the yearly background dose for Malaysia, and the radiation background dose is established by ESR tooth measurements on samples from India and Russia.",Excluded
3000,"Combined FET PET/MRI radiomics differentiates radiation injury from recurrent brain metastasis Background: The aim of this study was to investigate the potential of combined textural feature analysis of contrast-enhanced MRI (CE-MRI) and static O-(2-[18F]fluoroethyl)-L-tyrosine (FET) PET for the differentiation between local recurrent brain metastasis and radiation injury since CE-MRI often remains inconclusive. Method(s): Fifty-two patients with new or progressive contrast-enhancing brain lesions on MRI after radiotherapy (predominantly stereotactic radiosurgery) of brain metastases were additionally investigated using FET PET. Based on histology (n = 19) or clinicoradiological follow-up (n = 33), local recurrent brain metastases were diagnosed in 21 patients (40%) and radiation injury in 31 patients (60%). Forty-two textural features were calculated on both unfiltered and filtered CE-MRI and summed FET PET images (20-40 min p.i.), using the software LIFEx. After feature selection, logistic regression models using a maximum of five features to avoid overfitting were calculated for each imaging modality separately and for the combined FET PET/MRI features. The resulting models were validated using cross-validation. Diagnostic accuracies were calculated for each imaging modality separately as well as for the combined model. Result(s): For the differentiation between radiation injury and recurrence of brain metastasis, textural features extracted from CE-MRI had a diagnostic accuracy of 81% (sensitivity, 67%; specificity, 90%). FET PET textural features revealed a slightly higher diagnostic accuracy of 83% (sensitivity, 88%; specificity, 75%). However, the highest diagnostic accuracy was obtained when combining CE-MRI and FET PET features (accuracy, 89%; sensitivity, 85%; specificity, 96%). Conclusion(s): Our findings suggest that combined FET PET/CE-MRI radiomics using textural feature analysis offers a great potential to contribute significantly to the management of patients with brain metastases.Copyright © 2018 The Authors",Excluded
60,"Comparison of the Demarcation Line on ASOCT After Simultaneous LASIK and Different Protocols of Accelerated Collagen Crosslinking: A Bilateral Eye Randomized Study PURPOSE: To compare the demarcation line depth after 2 different protocols of simultaneous laser in situ keratomileusis and collagen crosslinking (LASIK Xtra)., METHODS: Twenty-three patients receiving bilateral LASIK Xtra were included in this comparative interventional study. The corneal stroma was soaked with 0.22% riboflavin for 90 seconds before flap repositioning. One eye was then randomized to receive either 18 mW/cm of ultraviolet A irradiation for 120 seconds or for 180 seconds, whereas the fellow eye received the other irradiation duration. The demarcation line on anterior-segment optical coherence tomography and grading of corneal haze on slit lamp were compared at postoperative month 1., RESULTS: The average age was 29.0 +/- 8.2 years. There was no statistical difference in preoperative spherical equivalent refraction (P > 0.05). At postoperative 1 month, a well-defined demarcation line was visible in 74% and 70% in the 2- and 3-minute groups, respectively. The demarcation line depth was 282 +/- 51 mum and 284 +/- 43 mum, respectively (P = 1), and the ratio of the demarcation line depth to the postoperative central corneal thickness was 0.69 +/- 0.13 and 0.72 +/- 0.10 (P = 0.61). There was no difference in the percentage of eyes with grade 1 or 2 corneal haze (P = 0.76)., CONCLUSIONS: The depth of the demarcation line was the same after receiving 18-mW/cm irradiation for either 2 or 3 minutes. The amount of early postoperative corneal haze was also similar. We postulate that there was lack of oxygen in the corneal tissue to fuel the photochemical reaction despite given additional time.",Excluded
852,"Stricture of the proximal esophagus in head and neck carcinoma patients after radiotherapy BACKGROUND. It is well recognized that many patients with head and neck carcinoma have problems with food intake and malnutrition. The objective of the current study was to determine the clinical pattern of patients with nonneoplastic stricture of the upper esophagus after radiotherapy for head and neck carcinoma. METHODS. A retrospective chart study of 22 patients with stricture of the proximal esophagus diagnosed between 1993 and 1999 at Karolinska Hospital was performed. The dose volume histograms of the first 2 cm and 5 cm, respectively, of the proximal esophagus were calculated. RESULTS. Five of the patients (23%) had total obliteration. The first 2 cm of the esophagus received at least 60 grays (Gy) in > 80% of the volume. Radiation injury was not reported to occur at doses < 60 Gy. There was a correlation found between dysphagia during radiotherapy and the development of proximal esophageal stricture. Stricture was diagnosed 1-60 months (median, 6 months) after radiotherapy. In 18 patients, the stricture was treated with single or repeated endoscopic dilation. These treatments allowed a nearly normal diet in 78% of the patients. CONCLUSIONS. Stricture of the upper esophagus is one deglutition disorder that is reported to occur after radiotherapy for head and neck carcinoma. In the current study, the authors emphasize the importance of knowing the tolerance of the normal esophagus to irradiation as well as early diagnosis of stricture of the proximal esophagus because this condition may lead to physical and emotional distress. © 2003 American Cancer Society.",Excluded

Peak aerobic capacity (VO2peak), ventilatory threshold (VT), and isokinetic and leg press tests were performed before and after bed rest to evaluate cardiovascular and muscle functions. Muscle cross-sectional area (CSA) was determined before, during, and after bed rest using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)., RESULTS: Improvements from before to after bed rest were observed in VO2peak (2.8 +/- 0.2 to 3.2 +/- 0.2 L.min(-1)), VT (1.9 +/- 0.2 to 2.1 +/- 0.2 L.min(-1)), leg muscle power (1582 +/- 317 to 1740 +/- 359 W), and muscle CSA of the grouped vastus lateralis, vastus intermedius, and vastus medialis muscles (67.5 +/- 8.4 to 68.9 +/- 8.3 cm).

2409,"Clinical characteristics of brain metastases from lung cancer according to histological type: Pretreatment evaluation and survival following whole-brain radiotherapy The histological type of lung cancer in patients with brain metastases may affect response to treatment and survival. We evaluated the clinical characteristics of brain metastases from lung cancer according to histological type in 70 consecutive patients with brain metastases from histologically confirmed lung cancer, who had been previously treated with whole-brain radiotherapy (WBRT). Histological type was divided into three categories: adenocarcinoma, small-cell lung carcinoma (SCLC) and other non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). The number, size and maximum diameter of brain metastases, the size and maximum diameter of peritumoral edema, the ratio of tumor and peritumoral edema, the asymptomatic ratio, the tumor size reduction rate, the complete response (CR) rate, the intracranial progression-free survival (PFS) and the overall survival (OS) were also evaluated. The median survival time for all patients was 26.2 weeks. Patients with SCLC exhibited a significantly smaller edema size and maximum diameter of edema compared to patients with other NSCLC (P=0.016 and 0.010, respectively). The ratio of tumor and peritumoral edema was also significantly lower in patients with SCLC compared to that in patients with adenocarcinoma and other NSCLC (P=0.001). Significant differences in intracranial PFS and OS between adenocarcinoma and other NSCLC were also observed (P=0.018 and 0.004, respectively). Patients with adenocarcinoma who were treated with epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) following WBRT, demonstrated a significant improvement in intracranial PFS and OS (P=0.008 and 0.004, respectively). The findings presented in this study may provide useful information for the management of brain metastases. Patients with SCLC exhibit a tendency to develop peritumoral edema to a lesser extent, compared to patients with other histological tumor types. Findings in the present study suggest that patients with adenocarcinoma, particularly those treated with EGFR-TKIs, exhibit improved survival rates.",Excluded
720,"Is lateral opening of the cup related to pelvic tilt on the surgical table? Introduction: Surgical table and floor are the usual references for positioning the cup. This is correct if pelvis is perpendicular to them (tilt 0degree). But if shoulder girdle is wider than pelvic girdle, pelvis will be tilted towards the feet. And if shoulder girdle is narrower than pelvic girdle, pelvis will be tilted towards the head. Objective(s): To analyse pelvic tilt on surgical table ant its influence on lateral opening of the cup. Method(s): Prospective, blind, observational study. Fifty THA patients (26 female), 1 department, multiple surgeons. Lateral decubitus, horizontal surgical table, conventional anterior (pubic) and posterior (lumbar spine) supports. Preoperative measures: (with custom-made measuring device) width of shoulder and pelvic girdles, pelvic tilt (angle between horizontal surgical table and a line by both antero-superior iliac spines), pelvic tilt towards head or feet. Postero-lateral approach. Theoretical position of cup intended by surgeons: 45degree valgus. Post-surgical x-ray: measure of lateral opening of cup. Result(s): 21/50 (4 males): pelvic girdle 27 mm wider than shoulder girdle (female phenotype), pelvic tilt 1 +/- 7degree towards head, theoretical risk of horizontal cup. Radiographic lateral opening of the cup: 43 +/- 10degree. 3/50 (2 males): pelvic girdle width similar to shoulder girdle, pelvic tilt 7 +/- 2degree towards feet, theoretical risk of vertical cup. Radiographic valgus of cup: 43.8degree. 26/50 (18 males): shoulder girdle 23 mm wider than pelvis (male phenotype), pelvic tilt 1 +/- 5degree towards feet, theoretical risk of vertical cup. Radiographic valgus of cup: 45 +/- 9degree. No result is statistically significant. Conclusion(s): 1) Different widths of shoulder and pelvic girdles could theoretically influence pelvic tilt of patients in lateral decubitus on surgical table. 2) But actually most patients present a minor pelvic tilt. 3) The average radiographic valgus of cups is near 45degree, but the standard deviation is great and an important number is out of recommended range.",Excluded

2106,"Irradiation-resistance conferred by superoxide dismutase: possible adaptive role of a natural polymorphism in Drosophila melanogaster The toxic effects of ionizing radiation to DNA are thought to be due to the generation of the superoxide radical, 02-. Superoxide dismutase (SOD), which scavenges 02-., has been invoked as a protecting enzyme against ionizing radiation in viruses, bacteria, mammalian cells in culture, and live mice. We now demonstrate that SOD is involved in the resistance of Drosophila melanogaster against irradiation. The protection is greatest when flies carry the S form of the enzyme (which exhibits highest in vitro specific activity), intermediate when they carry the F form of the enzyme, and lowest when they are homozygous for N, an allele that reduces the amount of the enzyme to 3.5% of the normal level. Natural selection experiments show that the fitness of the high-activity S allele is increased in an irradiated population relative to the nonirradiated control. These results point towards a possible adaptive function of the S/F polymorphism found in natural populations of D. melanogaster.",Included
324,"Feasibility and acute efficacy of radiofrequency ablation of cavotricuspid isthmus-dependent atrial flutter guided by real-time 3D TEE Objectives: The aim of this study was to evaluate the feasibility and acute efficacy of real-time 3-dimensional transesophageal echocardiography (RT3DTEE)guided ablation of the cavotricuspid isthmus (CVTI). Background(s): The use of RT3DTEE to guide a transcatheter radiofrequency ablation procedure has never been systematically investigated. Method(s): Seventy consecutive patients with CVTI-dependent atrial flutter underwent CVTI ablation. Procedural monitoring using RT3DTEE was assigned to patients who requested general anesthesia for the procedure (n = 21 [30%]). In the other 49 patients (the control group), the procedures were monitored using the standard fluoroscopic approach. Procedural time was considered as skin-to-skin electrophysiological procedure duration, not including anesthesia preparation; adequate radiofrequency ablation applications (with fixed temperature and power settings) were considered as lesions lasting < 60 s. Result(s): RT3DTEE allowed visualization of the CVTI and identified related structures in most patients (20 of 21); anatomic features such as long CVTI (n = 11), prominent Eustachian ridge (n = 9), prominent Eustachian valve (n = 6), septal recess (n = 8), and pectinate muscles (n = 10) were frequent. Also, RT3DTEE allowed continuous visualization of ablation catheter movement and contact. Compared with the control group, RT3DTEE was equally effective in achieving CVTI bidirectional block (100% in both groups), and no complications occurred. RT3DTEE shortened procedural time (median 73.0 min, interquartile range [IQR] 60.0 to 90.0 min, vs. median 115.0 min, IQR 85.0 to 133.0 min, p < 0.001), reduced radiation exposure (median fluoroscopy time 4.2 min, IQR 3.1 to 8.4 min, vs. median 19.3 min, IQR 12.9 to 36.4 min, p < 0.001; median fluoroscopy dose 575.4 cGy . cm2, IQR 428.5 to 1,299.4 cGy . cm2, vs. median 3,520.7 cGy . cm2, IQR 1,700.0 to 6,709.0 cGy . cm2, p < 0.001), and reduced the number of radiofrequency applications to achieve bidirectional block (median 7, IQR 6 to 10, vs. median 12, IQR 10 to 22, p = 0.007). A strong learning curve was detected by comparing procedural data between the first and last patients treated using RT3DTEE. Conclusion(s): RT3DTEE-guided ablation of CVTI was feasible, allowing real-time detailed morphological CVTI characterization as well as continuous visualization of the ablation catheter during radiofrequency ablation. This approach entailed marked reductions in procedural time, radiation exposure, and the number of radiofrequency applications. © 2011 American College of Cardiology Foundation.",Excluded
399,"Neuromuscular activation patterns during treadmill walking after space flight Astronauts adopt a variety of neuromuscular control strategies during space flight that are appropriate for locomoting in that unique environment, but are less than optimal upon return to Earth. We report here the first systematic investigation of potential adaptations in neuromuscular activity patterns associated with postflight locomotion. Astronaut-subjects were tasked with walking on a treadmill at 6.4 km/h while fixating a visual target 30 cm away from their eyes after space flights of 8-15 days. Surface electromyography was collected from selected lower limb muscles and normalized with regard to mean amplitude and temporal relation to heel strike. In general, high correlations (more than 0.80) were found between preflight and postflight activation waveforms for each muscle and each subject: however relative activation amplitude around heel strike and toe off was changed as a result of flight. The level of muscle cocontraction and activation variability, and the relationship between the phasic characteristics of the ankle musculature in preparation for toe off also were altered by space flight. Subjects also reported oscillopsia during treadmill walking after flight. These findings indicate that, after space flight, the sensory-motor system can generate neuromuscular-activation strategies that permit treadmill walking, but subtle changes in lower-limb neuromuscular activation are present that may contribute to increased lower limb kinematic variability and oscillopsia also present during postflight walking.",Excluded

Information obtained included patient characteristics, treatments received, highest recorded grade of OM during radiation therapy (none, mild, moderate, or severe), and outcomes potentially associated with mucosal injury., RESULTS: The mean age (+/- standard deviation [SD]) of the study subjects was 61.3 years (12.3 yrs); the majority of patients (80%) were men. Primary tumor locations included the oropharynx (26.4%), larynx (26.4%), oral cavity including the lip (24.4%), hypopharynx (13.6%), and nasopharynx (9.1%). The majority of tumors were new and were classified as AJCC Stages III or IV. The majority of patients (83%) received standard radiation therapy; the mean (+/- SD) cumulative dose was 6285 centigrays (cGy) (+/- 1158 cGy). Approximately 33% of the patients received concomitant chemotherapy. The majority of patients (83%) developed OM; 29% developed severe OM. Patients with severe OM were more likely to have nasopharyngeal or oropharyngeal tumors (adjusted odds ratio [OR] of 10.1 [95% confidence interval (95% CI), 2.1-49.9] and 6.9 [95% CI, 2.4-19.7], respectively), and to have received cumulative radiation doses > 5000 cGy (OR of 10.4; 95% CI, 2.9-37.1) and concomitant chemotherapy (OR of 3.3; 95% CI, 1.4-8.0).

Material(s) and Method(s): 320-row CTP was performed in 30 patients, and analyses were conducted independently by three different blinded readers by the use of two recent software releases (version 4.6 and novel version 4.71GR001, Toshiba, Tokyo, Japan). Analysis times were compared, and automated epi- and endocardial contour detection was subjectively rated in five categories (excellent, good, fair, poor and very poor). As semi-quantitative perfusion parameters, myocardial attenuation and transmural perfusion ratio (TPR) were calculated for each myocardial segment and agreement was tested by using the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC). Conventional coronary angiography served as reference standard. Result(s): The analysis time was significantly reduced with the novel automated software version as compared with the former release (Reader 1: 43:08 +/- 11:39 min vs. 09:47 +/- 04:51 min, Reader 2: 42:07 +/- 06:44 min vs. 09:42 +/- 02:50 min and Reader 3: 21:38 +/- 3:44 min vs. 07:34 +/- 02:12 min; p < 0.001 for all). Epi- and endocardial contour detection for the novel software was rated to be significantly better (p < 0.001) than with the former software. ICCs demonstrated strong agreement (>= 0.75) for myocardial attenuation in 93% and for TPR in 82%. Diagnostic accuracy for the two software versions was not significantly different (p = 0.169) as compared with conventional coronary angiography. Conclusion(s): The novel automated CTP analysis software offers enhanced time efficiency with an improvement by a factor of about four, while maintaining diagnostic accuracy.",Excluded

140,"Translocation Frequency in Patients with Repeated CT Exposure: Comparison with CT-Naive Patients Epidemiologic studies using clinical indicators are limited in the assessment of the biological effects of low-dose ionizing radiation for medical purposes. We evaluated the biological effect of low-dose radiation by comparing translocation frequencies in patients with repeated computed tomography (CT) exposure and CT-naive patients. The goal of this prospective case-control study was to determine whether repeated CT exposure is associated with increased frequency in chromosomal translocations. Two cohorts, comprised of case patients with a history of repeated CT exposure and age- and sex-matched CT-naive control patients (n = 48 per cohort), were consecutively enrolled in this single-institution study. CT-radiation exposure was estimated using dose-length products, and translocation frequencies of peripheral blood lymphocytes were assessed using whole chromosome paints by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH). Comparison of translocation frequencies between cases and controls was performed using the Wilcoxon rank sum test (paired samples), and the relationship between cumulative radiation exposure and translocation frequency was assessed using a partial correlation analysis. Translocation frequencies were significantly different between cases and controls (P = 0.0003). The median translocation frequency was 7 [95% confidence interval (CI): 6, 8] for cases and 4 (95% CI: 3, 6) for controls. By using cumulative radiation exposure as the effect variable and translocation frequency as the response variable, we found a significant correlation between cumulative radiation exposure and translocation frequency (r = 0.6579, P < 0.0001). Chromosomal translocations were more frequent with repeated CT-exposed patients than in CT-naive patients, and a positive dose-response relationship was present between cumulative radiation exposure and translocation frequency.",Included
492,"Case-control study on radiology work, medical x-ray investigations, and use of cellular telephones as risk factors for brain tumors CONTEXT: Ionizing radiation is a well-established risk factor for brain tumors. During recent years, microwave exposure from the use of cellular telephones has been discussed as a potential risk factor., OBJECTIVE: To determine risk factors for brain tumors., DESIGN: A case-control study, with exposure assessed by questionnaires., PARTICIPANTS: A total of 233 currently living men and women, aged 20 to 80 years, were included. The case patients had histopathologically verified brain tumors and lived in the Uppsala-Orebro region (1994-1996) or the Stockholm region (1995-1996). Two matched controls to each case were selected from the Swedish Population Register., MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Ionizing radiation and use of cellular telephones as risk factors for brain tumors., RESULTS: A total of 209 cases (90%) and 425 controls (91%) answered the questionnaire. Work as a physician yielded an odds ratio (OR) of 6.00, with a 95% confidence interval (CI) of 0.62 to 57.7. All three case patients had worked with fluoroscopy. Radiotherapy of the head and neck region yielded an OR of 3.61 (95% CI, 0.65-19.9). Medical diagnostic x-ray examination of the same area yielded an OR of 2.10 (95% CI, 1.25-3.53), with a tumor induction period of 5 years or more. Chemical industry work yielded an OR of 4.10 (95% CI, 1.25-13.4), and laboratory work yielded an OR of 3.21 (95% CI, 1.16-8.85). Ipsilateral use of cellular telephones increased the risk for tumors in the temporal, temporoparietal, and occipital lobes (OR, 2.42; 95% CI, 0.97-6.05), ie, the anatomic areas with highest exposure to microwaves from a mobile telephone. The result was further strengthened (OR, 2.62; 95% CI, 1.02-6.71) in a multivariate analysis that included laboratory work and medical diagnostic x-ray investigations of the head and neck., CONCLUSION: Exposure to ionizing radiation, work in laboratories, and work in the chemical industry increased the risk of brain tumors.

2136,"Validation of a New Method for 2D Fusion Imaging Registration in a System Prepared Only for 3D Purpose: To validate a new 2D-3D registration method of fusion imaging during aortic repair in a system prepared only for 3D-3D registration and to compare radiation doses and accuracy. Material(s) and Method(s): The study involved 189 patients, including 94 patients (median age 70 years; 85 men) who underwent abdominal endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR) with 2D-3D fusion on an Artis zee imaging system and 95 EVAR patients (median age 70 years; 81 men) from a prior study who had 3D-3D registration done using cone beam computed tomography (CBCT). For the 2D-3D registration, an offline CBCT of the empty operating table was imported into the intraoperative dataset and superimposed on the preoperative computed tomography angiogram (CTA). Then 2 intraoperative single-frame 2D images of the skeleton were aligned with the patient's skeleton on the preoperative CTA to complete the registration process. A digital subtraction angiogram was done to correct any misalignment of the aortic CTA volume. Values are given as the median [interquartile range (IQR) Q1, Q3]. Result(s): The 2D-3D registration had an accuracy of 4.0 mm (IQR 3.0, 5.0) after bone matching compared with the final correction with DSA (78% within 5 mm). By applying the 2D-3D protocol the radiation exposure (dose area product) from the registration of the fusion image was significantly reduced compared with the 3D-3D registration [1.12 Gy.cm2 (IQR 0.41, 2.14) vs 43.4 Gy.cm2 (IQR 37.1, 49.0), respectively; p<0.001). Conclusion(s): The new 2D-3D registration protocol based on 2 single-frame images avoids an intraoperative CBCT and can be used for fusion imaging registration in a system originally designed for 3D-3D only. This 2D-3D registration protocol is accurate and leads to a significant reduction in radiation exposure.Copyright © The Author(s) 2020.",Excluded

3270,"Geometric Image Biomarker Changes of the Parotid Gland Are Associated With Late Xerostomia Purpose To identify a surrogate marker for late xerostomia 12 months after radiation therapy (Xer12m), according to information obtained shortly after treatment. Methods and Materials Differences in parotid gland (PG) were quantified in image biomarkers (DELTAIBMs) before and 6 weeks after radiation therapy in 107 patients. By performing stepwise forward selection, DELTAIBMs that were associated with Xer12m were selected. Subsequently other variables, such as PG dose and acute xerostomia scores, were added to improve the prediction performance. All models were internally validated. Results Prediction of Xer12m based on PG surface reduction (DELTAPG-surface) was good (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve, 0.82). Parotid gland dose was related to DELTAPG-surface (P<.001, R2 = 0.27). The addition of acute xerostomia scores to the DELTAPG-surface improved the prediction of Xer12m significantly, and vice versa. The final model including DELTAPG-surface and acute xerostomia had outstanding performance in predicting Xer12m early after radiation therapy (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve, 0.90). Conclusions Parotid gland surface reduction was associated with late xerostomia. The early posttreatment model with DELTAPG-surface and acute xerostomia scores can be considered as a surrogate marker for late xerostomia.Copyright © 2017 The Author(s)",Excluded
1545,"Effect of Cisplatin on parotid gland function in concomitant radiochemotherapy PURPOSE: To determine the influence of concomitant radiochemotherapy with cisplatin on parotid gland tissue complication probability., METHODS AND MATERIALS: Patients treated with either radiotherapy (n = 61) or concomitant radiochemotherapy with cisplatin (n = 36) for head-and-neck cancer were prospectively evaluated. The dose and volume distributions of the parotid glands were noted in dose-volume histograms. Stimulated salivary flow rates were measured before, during the 2(nd) and 6(th) weeks and at 4 weeks and 6 months after the treatment. The data were fit using the normal tissue complication probability model of Lyman. Complication was defined as a reduction of the salivary flow rate to less than 25% of the pretreatment flow rate., RESULTS: The normal tissue complication probability model parameter TD(50) (the dose leading to a complication probability of 50%) was found to be 32.2 Gy at 4 weeks and 32.1 Gy at 6 months for concomitant radiochemotherapy and 41.1 Gy at 4 weeks and 39.6 Gy at 6 months for radiotherapy. The tolerated dose for concomitant radiochemotherapy was at least 7 to 8 Gy lower than for radiotherapy alone at TD(50)., CONCLUSIONS: In this study, the concomitant radiochemotherapy tended to cause a higher probability of parotid gland tissue damage. Advanced radiotherapy planning approaches such as intensity-modulated radiotherapy may be particularly important for parotid sparing in radiochemotherapy because of cisplatin-related increased radiosensitivity of glands.",Excluded
3475,"Noncancer disease incidence in the atomic bomb survivors: 1958-1986 Using the longitudinal data of the Adult Health Study (AHS) cohort collected during 1958-1986, we examined for the first time the relationship between exposure to ionizing radiation and the incidence of 19 nonmalignant disorders in the A-bomb survivors. Affected individuals were ascertained through the three-digit codes of the International Classification of Diseases which are encoded in the AHS database subsequent to diagnoses made on the basis of general laboratory tests, physical examinations, and history-taking conducted during biennial AHS examinations. The disease onset time was estimated using the mid-point between the AHS examination data when the disease was initially reported and the previously attended disease-free examination date. Dosimetry System 86 organ doses judged to be most appropriate were used. Tests of dose effects were performed assuming a linear relative risk model with stratified background incidence. For the entire study period, significant excess risk was detected for uterine myoma (P < 0.001), chronic liver disease and cirrhosis (P = 0.006), and thyroid disease (P < 0.0001), defined broadly as the presence of one or more of certain noncancerous thyroid conditions. The incidence of myocardial infarction was shown to be increased (P = 0.03) in later years (1968-1986) among the younger heavily exposed AHS subjects, confirming the results of the recent Life Span Study (LSS) noncancer mortality report on coronary heart disease. The findings for uterine myoma may serve as additional evidence indicating benign tumor growth as a possible consequence of radiation exposure. Our results indicating the involvement of radiation in the development of liver diseases are consistent with the report of increased mortality from liver cirrhosis with radiation dose in the LSS cohort. An effect of age at exposure was detected for nonmalignant thyroid disease (P = 0.02), with an increased risk for those exposed who were under 20 years of age, but not for older survivors. Thus the AHS data suggest that thyroid glands in the young are more radiosensitive not only to the development of malignancies, but also to the development of nonmalignant disorders as well. The findings hold independently of the dose effects observed for thyroid cancer. This study also shows that for the period 1958-1986 new occurrences of lens opacity are not increased with radiation dose (P = 0.39) in the AHS subjects.",Included

Methods and Materials To ensure a minimum of 5 years of clinical follow-up, this study identified a cohort of 76 patients treated consecutively with FSRT between 1998 and 2007 for pituitary adenomas: 71% (54/76) had nonfunctioning and 29% (22/76) had functioning adenomas (15 adrenocorticotrophic hormone-secreting, 5 growth hormone-secreting, and 2 prolactin-secreting). Surgery was used before FSRT in 96% (73/76) of patients. A median isocenter dose of 50.4 Gy was delivered in 28 fractions, with 100% of the planning target volume covered by the 90% isodose. Patients were followed up clinically by endocrinologists, ophthalmologists, and radiation oncologists. Serial magnetic resonance imaging was used to assess tumor response. Results With a median follow-up time of 6.8 years (range, 0.6 - 13.1 years), the 7-year progression-free survival was 97.1% and disease-specific survival was 100%. Of the 2 patients with tumor progression, both had disease control after salvage surgery. Of the 22 patients with functioning adenomas, 50% (11/22) had complete and 9% (2/22) had partial responses after FSRT. Of the patients with normal pituitary function at baseline, 48% (14/29) experienced 1 or more hormone deficiencies after FSRT. Although 79% (60/76) of optic chiasms were at least partially within the planning target volumes, no patient experienced radiation-induced optic neuropathy. No patient experienced radionecrosis. No secondary malignancy occurred during follow-up.

Assessment of life quality and accelerated biological aging of accident liquidators] In this paper, some final results of 25-year investigations carried out in Scientific Centre for Radiation Medicine and Burns MH RA (SCRMB) on the Armenian cohort of the Chernobyl accident consequences liquidators are shown. These results show that health conditions of the liquidators became worse during the whole observation period. A considerable development of both pathological states atypical of radiation damages and diseases, which may be considered as radiation-induced ones, was determined. Rise of the sickness rate of almost all organism systems, first of all, nervous, cardiovascular, respiratory and digestive ones, was observed. In 70% of liquidators the main disease was primarily detected after working on CNPP. In the intervening years, the average number of diagnoses per 1 liquidator increased from 1.5 in 1987 to 7-8 in the recent time. In addition to the detected diseases, particular functional shifts in neuropsychological and vegetative status of the liquidators were observed. The overwhelming majority of them have increased tonicity of the sympathetic vegetative nervous system, asthenic and depressive syndromes occurring in the form of weakness, somnolence, mood instability, mental capacity decrease, and memory defects. In the paper, the results of investigations aimed at clarification of changes in biological aging processes of the liquidators and assessment of their ""life quality"" features in terms of physical, psychical and social welfare are considered. Biological aged-related passportization in a definite part of liquidators elucidated an accelerated aging rate.

However, the optimal combination remains unclear. The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of 2 induction chemotherapy cycles (days 1 and 22) with docetaxel 75 mg/m2 and cisplatin 75 mg/m2 followed by concurrent chemotherapy (weekly docetaxel-cisplatin, 20 mg/m2) and 3-D conformal radiotherapy for 6 weeks (66 Gy/5 fractions per week/2 Gy per fraction). The primary endpoint was the response rate. Secondary objectives were toxicity, time to progression, and overall survival. Forty-four patients were included and 40 were eligible. The mean age was 60.5 years (range 40.7-72.1), and 75% had stage IIIB disease. Six patients underwent complete R0 resection including 2 pathologic complete responses after a planned intermediate evaluation. Thirty-three patients completed CHRT. The objective response rate was 65% (95% CI 50.2-79.8). Grade 3-4 hematologic and digestive toxicities were observed mainly during the induction phase. Grade 3 esophagitis (5%) was experienced during CHRT. With a median follow-up of 38.7 months, the median progression-free survival was 28.3 months (95% CI 11.0-35.0) and the median survival rate was 31.4 months.

There was a control group of 20 patients (9 women, 11 men). The Radiation Therapy Oncology Group/European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (RTOG/EORTC) scoring system was used for grading the severity of the proctitis. Endoscopic scoring of late rectal mucosal damage was performed using Gilinsky's classification. Serum levels of VEGF were analysed by the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay method., RESULTS: Most patients presented with Grade 1 symptoms. Endoscopic assessment showed that most patients had Grade 1 late rectal mucosal damage. The predominant endoscopic finding was the presence of telangiectasia. Assessment of VEGF correlation between the control group and the degrees of endoscopic changes showed statistically significant differences for all three degrees (P < 0.0001, P = 0.0251 and P = 0.0005, respectively). Due to the small numbers of patients with Grades 2 and 3 symptoms using the RTOG/EORTC scoring system, they were grouped with Grades 1 and 4 respectively forming two groups for statistical purposes. VEGF expression differed significantly between controls and group I and between controls and group II (P = 0.0001, P = 0.0009, respectively)., CONCLUSION: A significant increase in VEGF expression was found to correlate with clinical symptoms and endoscopic rectal mucosa changes in patients with ChRP, suggesting that it may play an important role in pathological angiogenesis.

Method(s):Patients not eligible for curative radiotherapy were randomised to receive either chemoradiation or chemotherapy alone. Four courses of intravenous carboplatin on day 1 and oral vinorelbin on days 1 and 8 were given with 3-week intervals. Patients in the chemoradiation arm also received radiotherapy with fractionation 42 Gy/15, starting at the second chemotherapy course. The primary end point was overall survival; secondary end points were health-related quality of life (HRQOL) and toxicity. Result(s):Enrolment was terminated due to slow accrual after 191 patients from 25 Norwegian hospitals were randomised. Median age was 67 years and 21% had PS 2. In the chemotherapy versus the chemoradiation arm, the median overall survival was 9.7 and 12.6 months, respectively (P<0.01). One-year survival was 34.0% and 53.2% (P<0.01). Following a minor decline during treatment, HRQOL remained unchanged in the chemoradiation arm. The patients in the chemotherapy arm reported gradual deterioration during the subsequent months.

1862,"Interventional cardiologists and risk of radiation-induced cataract: results of a French multicenter observational study BACKGROUND: Interventional cardiologists (ICs) are exposed to X-rays and may be at risk to develop cataract earlier than common senile cataract. Excess risk of posterior subcapsular cataract, known as radiation-induced, was previously observed in samples of ICs from Malaysia, and Latin America. The O'CLOC study (Occupational Cataracts and Lens Opacities in interventional Cardiology) was performed to quantify the risk at the scale of France., METHODS: This cross-sectional multicenter study included an exposed group of ICs from different French centers and an unexposed control group of non-medical workers. Individual information was collected about cataract risk factors and past and present workload in catheterization laboratory. All participants had a clinical eye examination to classify the lens opacities (nuclear, cortical, or posterior subcapsular) with the international standard classification LOCS III., RESULTS: The study included 106 ICs (mean age = 51 +/- 7 years) and 99 unexposed control subjects (mean age = 50 +/- 7 years). The groups did not differ significantly in the prevalence of either nuclear or cortical lens opacities (61% vs. 69% and 23% vs. 29%, respectively). However, posterior subcapsular lens opacities, were significantly more frequent among ICs (17% vs. 5%, p=0.006), for an OR=3.9 [1.3-11.4]. The risk increased with duration of activity but no clear relationship with workload was observed. However, the risk appeared lower for regular users of protective lead glasses (OR=2.2 [0.4-12.8])., CONCLUSIONS: ICs, in France as elsewhere, are at high risk of posterior subcapsular cataracts. Use of protective equipment against X-rays, in particular lead glasses, is strongly recommended to limit this risk. Copyright © 2012 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.",Included
1053,"Variant Splicing and Influence of Ionizing Radiation on Human Endogenous Retrovirus K (HERV-K) Transcripts in Cancer Cell Lines Human endogenous retrovirus K (HERV-K) is the most intact retrovirus in the human genome. There are multiple full-length or near full-length HERV-K proviruses in it. To analyze which HERV-K proviruses give rise to viral transcripts in cancer cell lines and to test whether ionizing radiation can alter the levels of HERV-K transcripts, RT-PCR studies were undertaken using multiple human cancer cell lines. Primers from several positions in the viral genome were used and included pairs designed to cross splice junctions in viral RNAs. In the absence of ionizing radiation, transcripts were detected from multiple HERV-K proviruses in cell lines from human prostate, cervical, head and neck, or breast cancers, and the proviruses from which the transcripts originated varied among the different lines. Only one of 13 cell lines tested (cervical cancer line C33A) failed to show HERV-K transcripts. Spliced RNAs detected included viral RNAs spliced as expected at the conventional viral splice sites, plus several alternatively spliced RNAs. Alternatively spliced transcripts arose from specific proviruses, and were detected in most of the cell lines used. Quantitative RT-PCR was performed to assess the effects of ionizing radiation. These analyses showed that HERV-K transcripts were elevated in four of twelve lines tested, specifically all three prostate cancer lines used and one breast cancer line. The increases were transient, peaking at 24 hours following a single dose of gamma-irradiation that ranged from 2.5 to 20 Gy, and returning to baseline levels by 72 hours. In summary, these studies showed that ionizing radiation can affect the levels of HERV-K transcripts in cells, and these effects vary among different cells. The changes in HERV-K transcript levels might affect multiple biological processes in cells, and future studies of the effects of ionizing radiation on HERV-K are worth pursuing. © 2013 Agoni et al.",Excluded
3558,"Imaging quality and diagnostic reliability of low-dose computed tomography lumbar spine for evaluating patients with spinal disorders BACKGROUND CONTEXT: Computed tomography (CT) scans of the lumbar spine (CTLS) have demonstrated a higher level of accuracy than plain films and have been used to assess patients with spinal disorder when magnetic resonance imaging is not available. Nevertheless, radiation exposure remains a serious safety concern. Iterative reconstruction (IR) decreases the CT radiation dose for diagnostic imaging. However, the feasibility of using IR in CTLS is unclear., PURPOSE: To evaluate the imaging quality and diagnostic reliability of CTLS with IR., STUDY DESIGN: A prospective study., PATIENT SAMPLE: All patients from outpatient departments who suffered from spinal disorders and were referred for CTLS., OUTCOME MEASURES: In acquired CT images, the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of the dural sac (DS), intervertebral disc (IVD), psoas muscle (PM), and L5 vertebral body, the contrast-to-noise ratio between the DS and IVD (D-D CNR), and the subjective imaging qualities were compared across groups. Interobserver agreement was evaluated with kappa values., METHODS: Patients receiving low radiation CTLS were divided into three groups. A 150 mAs tube current with 120 kVp tube voltage was used with Group A and a 230 mAs tube current with 100 kVp tube voltage with Group B. Intended end radiation exposure was 50% less than that of the control group. Tube modulation was active for all groups. The images of the two low-radiation groups were reconstructed by IR; those of the control group by filtered back-projection (FBP)., RESULTS: The SNRs of the DS, IVD, PM, BM, and D-D CNR of Group A were not inferior to those of the control group. All SNRs and D-D CNRs for Group B were inferior to those of the control group. Except for that of the facet joint, all subjective imaging ratings for anatomic regions were equivalent between Groups A and B. Interobserver agreement was highest for the control group (0.72-0.88), followed by Group A (0.69-0.83) and B (0.55-0.83)., CONCLUSIONS: Fifty percent tube current reduction combined with IR provides equivalent diagnostic accuracy and improved patient safety when compared with conventional CTLS. Our results support its use as a screening tool. With the tube modulation technique, further adjustments in weighting IR and FBP algorithms based on body mass index become unnecessary.Copyright © 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.",Excluded
2786,"Dynamic in vivo profiling of DNA damage and repair after radiotherapy using canine patients as a model Time resolved data of DNA damage and repair after radiotherapy elucidates the relation between damage, repair, and cell survival. While well characterized in vitro, little is known about the time-course of DNA damage response in tumors sampled from individual patients. Kinetics of DNA damage after radiotherapy was assessed in eight dogs using repeated in vivo samples of tumor and co-irradiated normal tissue analyzed with comet assay and phosphorylated H2AX (gammaH2AX) immunohistochemistry. In vivo results were then compared (in silico) with a dynamic mathematical model for DNA damage formation and repair. Maximum %DNA in tail was observed at 15-60 min after irradiation, with a rapid decrease. Time-courses of gammaH2AX-foci paralleled these findings with a small time delay and were not influenced by covariates. The evolutionary parameter search based on %DNA in tail revealed a good fit of the DNA repair model to in vivo data for pooled sarcoma time-courses, but fits for individual sarcoma time-courses suffer from the heterogeneous nature of the in vivo data. It was possible to follow dynamics of comet tail intensity and gammaH2AX-foci during a course of radiation using a minimally invasive approach. DNA repair can be quantitatively investigated as time-courses of individual patients by integrating this resulting data into a dynamic mathematical model.Copyright © 2017 by the authors.

The aim of this investigation was to evaluate the long-term effects of ionizing radiation on pulp vitality by measuring pulp oxygenation levels (%SpO2) in patients with history of RT of intraoral and oropharyngeal tumors 4-6 years after treatment., METHODS: In an experimental group RT (n = 90, history of RT) and a control group CON (n = 90, no history of RT), pulp vitality was assessed by measuring %SpO2 by using pulse oximetry and pulp sensitivity by cold thermal testing. All anterior teeth without history of endodontic therapy of the participants in group RT were measured (n = 693), regardless of the quadrant and the irradiated area. An equal number of anterior teeth were tested in group CON., RESULTS: There was no significant difference between the %SpO2 levels in group RT (92.7%; standard deviation, +/- 1.83) and group CON (92.6%; standard deviation, +/- 1.80). All teeth in RT and CON groups showed a positive response to the thermal test. All tested teeth were considered vital., CONCLUSIONS: Pulp %SpO2 was found to be within normal limits 4-6 years after RT. This suggests that RT may not have a long-term influence on pulp vitality, and reported short-term changes in pulpal microcirculation because of RT may be temporary.

3203,"Differential effects of genotoxic stress on both concurrent body growth and gradual senescence in the adult zebrafish Among vertebrates, fish and mammals show intriguing differences in their growth control properties with age. The potential for unlimited or indeterminate growth in a variety of fish species has prompted many questions regarding the senescent phenomena that appear during the aging process in these animals. Using zebrafish as our model system, we have attempted in our current study to examine the growth phenomena in fish in relation to the onset of senescence-associated symptoms, and to evaluate the effects of genotoxic stress on these processes. We observed in the course of these analyses that the zebrafish undergoes continuous growth, irrespective of age, past the point of sexual maturation with gradually decreasing growth rates at later stages. Animal population density, current body size and chronological age also play predominant roles in regulating zebrafish growth and all inversely influence the growth rate. Interestingly, the induction of genotoxic stress by exposure to ionizing radiation (IR) did not adversely affect this body growth ability in zebrafish. However, IR was found to chronically debilitate the regeneration of amputated caudal fins and thereby induce high levels of abnormal fin regeneration in the adult zebrafish. In addition, by resembling and mimicking the natural course of aging, IR treatments likewise enhanced several other symptoms of senescence, such as a decline in reproductive abilities, increased senescence-associated beta-galactosidase activity and a reduction in melatonin secretion. Our current data thus suggest that during the lifespan of zebrafish, the onset of senescence-associated symptoms occurs in parallel with continuous growth throughout mid-adulthood. Moreover, our present findings indicate that genotoxic DNA damage may play a role as a rate-limiting factor during the induction of senescence, but not in the inhibition of continuous, density-dependent growth in adult zebrafish.",Included
2312,"Multilocus inheritance determines predisposition to alpha-radiation induced bone tumourigenesis in mice In a recent study, we presented evidence for genetic predisposition governing radiation osteosarcomagenesis in mice. Following the incorporation of the bone-seeking alpha emitter 227Th, ~25% of the variance in osteosarcoma incidence was determined by inherited genetic factors. We have now mapped 5 susceptibility loci in crosses between the more susceptible BALB/c and the more resistant CBA/Ca strains. The major QTL on chromosome 14 overlaps with a locus that was already found in our previous study, using different strains of mice. Here, we investigate the effect by which the major susceptibility locus and 4 minor modifier loci interact to influence osteosarcoma predisposition. Following incorporation of the bone-seeking isotope, 100% of mice that harbour high-risk genotypes at all 5 susceptibility loci develop osteosarcoma with an average of 472 days latency times. In 10 mice inheriting exclusively low-risk genotypes only 1 osteosarcoma was found, arising after 733 days latency time. Inheritance of distinct combinations of BALB/c and CBA/Ca alleles at the susceptibility loci confer more extreme phenotypes in terms of susceptibility or resistance than observed in either of the two parental inbred strains. From the present study, we demonstrate that additive effects of multiple alleles, each making only a minor phenotypic contribution, can combine and significantly alter tumour risk. This mechanism can be of particular importance in genetically heterogeneous populations such as man. © 2005 Wiley-Liss, Inc.",Included
3123,"Radiation protection knowledge and practices in interventional cardiologists practicing in Africa: a cross sectional survey We conducted a survey of doctors working in the cardiac catheterisation laboratories in Africa on their knowledge, attitude and practice with respect to radiation protection. Of seventy-two respondents contacted, 61 (84.7%) completed the questionnaire. Twenty-eight, (45.9%) were younger than 45 years. Thirty-seven, (60.6%) had less than 10 years of experience in the laboratory. Only 28 (45.9%) had undertaken radiation protection training. Fifty-eight, (95.1%) consistently used lead aprons. Forty-seven, (77%) reported consistently using thyroid shields. Ten (16.4%) consistently used radiation protection eyeglasses, whilst 36 (59%) never used them. Thermoluminescent Dosimeter badges were consistently used in 23 (37.7%). Forty-two, (68.9%) reported having ceiling mounted lead/acrylic shields. Level of radiation exposure in the most recent one year was <=2 mSv in 14, between 2 and 20 mSv in 8 and between 20 and 30 mSv in 2, whilst 33 did not know their dose readings. The use of basic radiation protection tools as well as the knowledge and measurement of radiation exposure among interventional cardiologists working in Africa is low. The unavailability of some of the protective tools and a knowledge gap in terms of radiation protection and monitoring of self-exposure were some of the reasons for suboptimal self-protection against ionising radiation among our respondents. We suggest that initiatives be taken by all stakeholders to train this group of medical professionals in basic radiation protection to avoid unnecessary exposure to themselves, co-workers and patients.",Excluded
2049,"Allogeneic stem cell transplantation for idiopatic myelofibrosis: A single centre experience Background: Allogeneic Stem Cell Transplantation (ASCT) is the only curative option for Myelofibrosis (MF). Development of reduced intensity conditioning (RIC) regimens and introduction of Ruxolitinib (Rux) have improved the outcome of ASCT. However, this procedure is still burdened by substantial morbidity and high transplantrelated mortality (TRM). Here we report our experience with ASCT in MF setting, in order to evaluate the factors influencing post-transplant outcome, in term of overall survival (OS) and Progression-free survival (PFS). Method(s): In the last 10 years we performed 30 ASCT on 27 MF patients (pts); 3 pts of them received a second ASCT for MF relapse. The median age was 51 (range: 25-68) years. Driver mutations were found in 23 pts and were: JAK2V617F in 16 (59%), MPL in 3(11%) and CALR mutations in 4 (15%) pts; 4 (15%) pts were defined as ""triple-negative"". According to Dynamic International Prognostic Scoring System (DIPSS) at transplant, pts were stratified into high, intermediate-2 and intermediate-1 risk in 11 (41%), 12 (44%) and 4 (15%) cases, respectively. Considering the first ASCT, donors were matched related (MRD), matched unrelated (MUD) and haploidentical in 18 (67%), 7 (26%), and 2 (7%) of cases, respectively. Conditioning regimen (CR) was RIC in 11 pts (41%) or myeloablative in 16 pts (59%); all CR were Busulfan and Fludarabine-based, in 48% of cases (n=13) associated with Tiothepa. Conventional GVHD prophylaxis regimens were used according to type of ASCT. Splenectomy or spleen irradiation were performed before ASCT in 2 and 6 pts in pre-Rux era; 16 pts (59%) received Rux before ASCT. Source of stem cells were bone marrow in 15 (56%) or peripheral blood stem cells in 12 (44%) pts. OS and PFS have been evaluated by Kaplan-Meier analysis. Result(s): Aafter a median follow-up of 18.5 (range: 0.5 - 175) months from first ASCT, 4/27 pts (15%) died for early TRM, 6 (22%) pts for MF relapse (4) or leukemic evolution (2). 17 (63%) pts were alive, 15 of them with full chimerism and complete remission (one after the second ASCT); 2 pts were alive in MF relapse. Chronic GVHD occurred in 6 (22%) pts. The probability of OS for the entire cohort at 2 and 5 years was respectively 75% and 60% and the 2 and 5 year PFS was 75% and 55% respectively. In statistical analysis, significant predictive factors of good outcome were: intermediate-1 DIPSS score at transplant, Rux-exposition pre-transplant and development of chronic GVHD. There was no correlation between clinical outcome and type of driver mutations, age at transplant, donor type, CR, source of stem cells. Conclusion(s): ASCT in MF is actually a valid therapeutic option for pts eligible to the procedure also in the Rux era. In our experience, earlier stage of MF at time of transplant and Rux exposition before transplant seem to have a favourable impact on the outcome post-ASCT; also a chronic GVHD seems to play a protective role for reducing relapse risk post-ASCT.",Excluded
1752,"New effective dose estimates for Rubidium-82 based on dynamic PET/CT imaging in humans Objectives Published radiation dose estimates for Rubidium-82 vary widely, and no comprehensive study in man has yet been conducted. With the increasing use of Rb-82 PET for myocardial perfusion imaging, improved dosimetry information is needed for accurate risk assessment. The purpose of this study was to measure Rb-82 internal organ and effective doses with PET/CT in humans. Methods We recruited 26 cardiac patients and 4 normal subjects with no cardiac history. Dynamic 3D PET scans were acquired (GE Discovery RX/VCT) over 10 minutes following IV injection of 10 MBq/kg Rb-82. Images were reconstructed using FORE-OSEM and 8 mm Hann filter. Cardiac scans of the chest were acquired at rest for all 30 subjects, plus one additional scan of the Head, Neck, Abdomen, Pelvis, or Thighs. Mean Rb-82 residence times were determined in 22 source organs using volumes-of-interest (VOI) drawn on the fused PET/CT images. For large organs a small VOI was used to avoid partial volume losses. For small organs the average activity above 80% threshold was multiplied by the volume at 40% of the peak value within the organ VOI. Target organ doses and the effective dose estimate were calculated using OLINDA/EXM 1.0 according to ICRP 60, and recalculated according to ICRP 103. Results A total of 283 organs were measured across the 60 scans, with at least 4 samples obtained in each source organ. The average 'adult' effective dose for Rubidium-82 was found to be 0.00074 mSv/MBq using ICRP 60. Using ICRP 103, the male and female effective doses were 0.00074 and 0.00092 mSv/MBq respectively. The highest absorbed organ dose was to the kidneys. Conclusions These dose estimates for Rubidium-82 are the first to be measured directly with PET/CT in humans, and are 4 to 4.5 times lower than previous ICRP 60 values based on a theoretical blood flow model. The new values derived from human studies suggest a typical effective dose of 0.6 mSv per scan with 3D PET.",Excluded
2754,"Effect of topical application of Hypericum perforatum extract (St. John's wort) on skin sensitivity to solar simulated radiation St. John's wort (Hypericum perforatum) is a tradional folk remedy that is used for the topical treatment of superficial wounds, scars and burns. A characteristic metabolite of St. John's wort is the photodynamic active plant pigment hypericin. It is known that hypericin may cause a severe photodermatitis called hypericism when higher amounts of St. John's wort are ingested orally. To date, no reports on the photosensitizing capacity of topical application of St. John's wort are available. Here, we investigated the effects of Hypericum oil (hypericin 110 mug/mL) and Hypericum ointment (hypericin 30 mug/mL) on skin sensitivity to solar simulated radiation. Sixteen volunteers of the skin types II and III were tested on their volar forearms with solar simulated radiation for photosensitizing effects of Hypericum oil (n=8)and Hypericum ointment (n=8). The minimal erythema dose (MED) was determined by visual assessment, and skin erythema was evaluated photometrically. With the visual erythema score, no change of the MED could be detected after application of either Hypericum oil or Hypericum ointment (P>0.05). With the more sensitive photometric measurement, an increase of the erythema-index after treatment with the Hypericum oil could be detected (P<=0.01). The results do not provide evidence for a severe phototoxic potential of Hypericum oil and Hypericum ointment, detectable by the clinically relevant visual erythema score. However, the trend towards increased photosensitivity detected with the more sensitive photometric measurement could become relevant in fair-skinned individuals, in diseased skin or after extended solar irradiation.",Excluded

It is necessary to reduce the number of retake radiographs in radiology in order to reduce radiation exposure, money and time. 650 periapical intra oral radiographs taken by bisect-angle and parallel techniques were assessed in this study to detect the presence of artifacts and their frequency. Radiographic images were taken by third year dental students as part of their practical requirements using bisect angle and parallel techniques. Errors were tabled according to location and type. The major errors that were found in the study included (structures overlapping in percentage 15.07%, and the misplacement artifact in percentage 14.67%, the third error in frequency was elongation in percent 10.5. Errors classified according to anatomic location; Mandibular anterior teeth region was the most occurring site for errors with 39.3%, whereas the least errors frequency was 3.1% at maxillary molars projection.

704,"First analysis of cancer incidence and occupational radiation exposure based on the National Dose Registry of Canada A cohort study was conducted to investigate the relation between cancer incidence and occupational exposure to ionizing radiation. Records containing dose information from 1951 to 1988 for 191,333 persons were extracted from the National Dose Registry of Canada. The records were linked to the Canadian Cancer Data Base, with incidence data from 1969 to 1988. Standardized incidence ratios were calculated using Canadian cancer incidence rates stratified by age, sex, and calendar year. Excess relative risks were obtained from internally based dose-response analyses. The following significant results were found for males and females combined: a deficit in the standardized incidence ratio for all cancers combined; elevated standardized incidence ratios for thyroid cancer and melanoma; and elevated excess relative risks for rectum, leukemia, lung, all cancers combined, all except lung, and all except leukemia. For males, cancers of the colon, pancreas, and testis also showed significantly elevated excess relative risks. The specific cancer types listed above have been implicated in previous studies on occupational exposure to ionizing radiation, except for testis, colon, and melanoma, while the findings on thyroid cancer from previous studies are inconclusive. The thyroid standardized incidence ratios in this study are highly significant, but further investigation is needed to assess the possibility of association with occupational radiation exposure.",Included
924,"UV dose determines key characteristics of nonmelanoma skin cancer Basal cell carcinoma (BCC) and squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), known as nonmelanoma skin cancer (NMSC), are the most common cancers worldwide. Although many factors are involved in the pathogenesis of NMSC, UV radiation is an important risk factor. A fundamental question in skin cancer research is whether varying doses of total UV radiation influence key characteristics of NMSC. The hypothesis that differences in UV doses influence the BCC/ SCC ratio, number of tumors, and anatomic location of the tumor was investigated in 311 participants having 326 tumors and with exposure to a broad range of UV doses. An epidemiologic questionnaire was given to each participant soliciting detailed information on exposure to solar radiation. Environmental UVA and UVB doses were measured continually for 6 years at a permanent UV monitoring station. The total ratio of BCC/SCC was 3.5. Participants who received low and high UV doses had a BCC/SCC ratio of 4.2. Those who received very high UV doses had a ratio of 2.1. A very high UV dose was also associated with the doubling of the total number of tumors per person and a significantly increased risk of having SCC, a more aggressive malignancy. Tumors in sun-exposed areas (on the body) were more common in participants who received high and very high UV doses. The tumors in sun-protected areas were associated with exposure to lower levels of UV. This large-scale population study provides evidence that varying doses of UV radiation have a profound influence on key characteristics of NMSC.",Excluded
1068,"Heterogeneity of Necrotic Changes between Cortical and Cancellous Bone in Mandibular Osteoradionecrosis: A Histopathological Analysis of Resection Margin after Segmental Mandibulectomy Background. This study aimed to analyze differences in necrotic changes between cortical and cancellous bone in resection margins after segmental mandibulectomy for advanced mandibular osteoradionecrosis. Methods. Anteroposterior bone specimens from eleven patients who underwent segmental mandibulectomy with simultaneous free fibula flap reconstruction for advanced osteoradionecrosis were analyzed histopathologically for the presence of necrotic bone based on the presence of blood vessels within Haversian canals. Results. Ten of eleven (91%) cortices near the inferior border of the mandible at the anterior margins were necrotic. All cancellous bones at the anterior margins were viable. Seven of eleven (64%) cortices near the inferior border of the mandible at the posterior margins were necrotic. Three of eleven (27%) cancellous bones at the posterior margins were necrotic. Conclusion. Necrotic changes are more prevalent in cortices than in cancellous bones in mandibular osteoradionecrosis, probably due to a decrease of periosteal blood supply caused by radiotherapy.Copyright © 2017 Masaya Akashi et al.",Excluded
429,"Evaluation of the ECAT EXACT HR+ 3-D PET scanner in H2(15)O brain activation studies: dose fractionation strategies for rCBF and signal enhancing protocols We evaluated the performance of the ECAT EXACT HR+ 3-D whole-body positron emission tomography (PET) scanner when employed to measure brain function using H2(15)O bolus activation protocols that are completed in single same-day data acquisition sessions. Using vibrotactile and auditory stimuli as independent activation tasks, we studied the scanner performance under different imaging conditions in five healthy volunteers. Cerebral blood flow images were acquired from each volunteer using H2(15)O bolus injections of activity varying from 5-20 mCi. One-session dose-fractionation strategies were analyzed for rCBF, standard activity-concentration, switched, and cold-bolus/switched protocols. Performance characteristics. The scanner dead time grew linearly with injected dose from 10% to 25%. Random events varied from 30% to 50% of the detected events. Random and scattered events were corrected adequately at all doses. Estimated noise-effective-count curves plateau at about 10 mCi. One-session 12-injection bolus PET activation protocols. Using an acquisition protocol that accounts for the scanner performance and the practical aspects of imaging volunteers and neurological patients in a single same-day session, we assessed the correlation between the significance of activation foci and the dose/injection used. The one-session protocol employs 12 bolus injections/subject. We present evidence suggesting that when an rCBF protocol is used, image noise is reduced significantly when the activity injected increases from 5 to 10 mCi. Increasing the dose from 10 to 15 or 20 mCi yielded further but smaller reductions. Our observations also suggest that image noise will be strongly reduced if a 20-mCi dose/injection is used when data are collected using protocols that employ long acquisition times such as a switched or a cold-bolus/switched protocol.",Excluded
2061,"Evaluation of safety of porous surface electrodes for STS Retinal prosthesis Purpose: We have reported that our originally developed retinal prostheses with suprachoroidal-transretinal stimulation (STS) effectively elicited phosphene with current less than 1.0 mA in patients with advanced retinitis pigmentosa (Fujikado, IOVS 2010). Now we have developed a novel porous stimulating electrode (porous electrode) for retinal prostheses for STS system (Terasawa, ARVO 2012). The porous electrode has a large surface area introducing porous surface of the platinum bulk electrode with a femtosecond laser irradiation. To verify their safety, we investigated the threshold current Methods: Ten eyes of 10 pigmented rabbits were used in this study. We created a scleral pocket at the posterior pole of the eye and implanted the stimulating electrode. The stimulating electrode comprised a single-channel porous electrode (diameter, 0.5 mm; height, 0.3 mm). The rabbits were divided into four groups and stimulated with electrical currents of different intensities: 1.0 mA (n = 2), 1.5 mA (n = 3), 2.0 mA (n = 3), and 3.0 mA (n = 2). Continuous biphasic pulses of 0.5 ms/phase were applied at a frequency of 20 Hz for 48 h under general anesthesia. Fundus photography, fluorescein angiography (FA), and optical coherence tomography (OCT) were performed before and after applying the electrical currents. After the experiment was concluded, the eyes were enucleated and the retinas were stained with hematoxylin and eosin, and examined by light microscopy. Result(s): In the 1.0 mA and 1.5 mA groups, changes were not observed on fundus photography, FA, OCT, or histological examination. Leakage of fluorescent dye was observed in one of three cases in the 2.0 mA group and in all cases in the 3.0 mA group. Probit analysis of the relationship between retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) damage and stimulus intensity suggested that 2.1 mA led to an RPE damage incidence rate of 50%. Conclusion(s): These results indicate that the threshold current to induce retinal damage is greater than the current to elicit phosphene in STS. Therefore, the porous electrodes are feasible as stimulating electrodes for STS retinal prostheses.",Excluded
954,"Stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) for operable Stage i non-small-cell lung cancer: Can SBRT be comparable to surgery? Purpose: To review treatment outcomes for stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) in medically operable patients with Stage I non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC), using a Japanese multi-institutional database. Patients and Methods: Between 1995 and 2004, a total of 87 patients with Stage I NSCLC (median age, 74 years; T1N0M0, n = 65; T2N0M0, n = 22) who were medically operable but refused surgery were treated using SBRT alone in 14 institutions. Stereotactic three-dimensional treatment was performed using noncoplanar dynamic arcs or multiple static ports. Total dose was 45-72.5 Gy at the isocenter, administered in 3-10 fractions. Median calculated biological effective dose was 116 Gy (range, 100-141 Gy). Data were collected and analyzed retrospectively. Result(s): During follow-up (median, 55 months), cumulative local control rates for T1 and T2 tumors at 5 years after SBRT were 92% and 73%, respectively. Pulmonary complications above Grade 2 arose in 1 patient (1.1%). Five-year overall survival rates for Stage IA and IB subgroups were 72% and 62%, respectively. One patient who developed local recurrences safely underwent salvage surgery. Conclusion(s): Stereotactic body radiotherapy is safe and promising as a radical treatment for operable Stage I NSCLC. The survival rate for SBRT is potentially comparable to that for surgery. © 2011 Elsevier Inc.",Excluded

We report the first multicenter, blinded, and randomized trial of intracoronary radiation with the use of a 90Sr/90Y beta-source for the treatment of in-stent restenosis., METHODS AND RESULTS: After successful catheter-based treatment of in-stent restenosis, 476 patients were randomly assigned to receive an intracoronary catheter containing either 90Sr/90Y (n=244) or placebo (n=232) sources. The prescribed dose 2 mm from the center of the source was 18.4 Gy for vessels between 2.70 and 3.35 mm in diameter and 23.0 Gy for vessels between 3.36 and 4.0 mm. The primary end point, ie, clinically driven target-vessel revascularization by 8 months, was observed in 56 (26.8%) of the patients assigned to placebo and 39 (17.0%) of the patients assigned to radiation (P=0.015).

Subjective complaints were documented by the 39-item National Eye Institute Visual Function Questionnaire (NEI VFQ-39) and a straylight questionnaire., RESULTS: The population comprised 217 patients with a mean age of 72 years +/- 9.12 (SD) (range 29 to 90 years). Preoperatively, the mean straylight was 1.55 +/- 0.29 log(s) and the mean CDVA, 0.28 +/- 0.21 logMAR. Visual acuity and straylight showed little correlation (R(2) = 0.08). The mean postoperative improvement in CDVA was 0.26 +/- 0.20 logMAR (range -0.12 to 1.12 logMAR) and in straylight, 0.31 +/- 0.32 log(s) (range -0.50 to 1.27 log[s]). The preoperative breakeven point (50% chance of postoperative improvement) was 0.06 logMAR for CDVA and 1.29 log(s) for straylight. Preoperative and postoperative questionnaires showed straylight had almost the same influence as visual acuity on quality of vision., CONCLUSIONS: Straylight and visual acuity measure different aspects of quality of vision and influenced subjective visual quality almost equally.

3473,"Do persons living near a uranium processing site have evidence of increased somatic cell gene mutations? A first study The objective of this study was to examine if individuals living near a uranium processing site have greater mutagenic damage, as measured by three mutagenicity assays, compared with subjects unexposed to any nuclear facilities. The design was a cross-sectional exploratory analysis of 112 subjects; 56 volunteer residents were from within a 5-mile radius of the Fernald Uranium Processing site and 56 'control' subjects were from a geographically separate area unexposed to any known uranium emissions. The groups were constrained to be similar in age and sex composition. The main outcome measures were three human somatic gene mutation assays consisting of the HPRT T-lymphocyte cloning assay to measure 6-thioguanine resistant lymphocytes; the glycophorin A assay to detect the loss of expression of the M or N allele; and the micronucleus assay as a marker of chromosomal damage. The results showed no statistically significant or quantitatively important differences between groups for all three mutagenicity assays; only the unselected cloning efficiency was statistically significantly different between groups (0.42 +/- 0.16 for the Fernald versus 0.35 +/- 0.12 for the comparison groups). In both groups, age was significantly related to HPRT mutant frequency, with a 1.25% rate of increase in mutant frequencies for each 1-year gain of age in the Fernald group and a 1.12% rate of increase in mutant frequencies for each 1-year gain of age in the comparison group. For the micronucleus data, females had a greater mean micronucleus frequency than males. In addition, smokers had an increased mean ln (natural logarithm) HPRT mutant frequency (3.06 +/- 0.14 for current smokers compared with a mean of 2.72 +/- 0.05 for non-current (i.e. never plus former) smokers). Our results are consistent with the previously reported association between sex type and micronucleus frequency, the known relationship between age and T-lymphocyte cloning efficiency and age and HPRT mutant frequency, and verify the wide inter-subject variability for the latter. Finally, we conclude that at a population level, the relationships between current cigarette use and HPRT mutant frequency, and sex type and micronucleus frequency, are stronger than is the association between geographic proximity to a uranium processing site and mutagenic abnormalities.",Included
1314,"Is multidetector CT-based bone mineral density and quantitative bone microstructure assessment at the spine still feasible using ultra-low tube current and sparse sampling? OBJECTIVE: Osteoporosis diagnosis using multidetector CT (MDCT) is limited to relatively high radiation exposure. We investigated the effect of simulated ultra-low-dose protocols on in-vivo bone mineral density (BMD) and quantitative trabecular bone assessment., MATERIALS AND METHODS: Institutional review board approval was obtained. Twelve subjects with osteoporotic vertebral fractures and 12 age- and gender-matched controls undergoing routine thoracic and abdominal MDCT were included (average effective dose: 10 mSv). Ultra-low radiation examinations were achieved by simulating lower tube currents and sparse samplings at 50%, 25% and 10% of the original dose. BMD and trabecular bone parameters were extracted in T10-L5., RESULTS: Except for BMD measurements in sparse sampling data, absolute values of all parameters derived from ultra-low-dose data were significantly different from those derived from original dose images (p<0.05). BMD, apparent bone fraction and trabecular thickness were still consistently lower in subjects with than in those without fractures (p<0.05)., CONCLUSION: In ultra-low-dose scans, BMD and microstructure parameters were able to differentiate subjects with and without vertebral fractures, suggesting osteoporosis diagnosis is feasible. However, absolute values differed from original values. BMD from sparse sampling appeared to be more robust. This dose-dependency of parameters should be considered for future clinical use., KEY POINTS: * BMD and quantitative bone parameters are assessable in ultra-low-dose in vivo MDCT scans. * Bone mineral density does not change significantly when sparse sampling is applied. * Quantitative trabecular bone microstructure measurements are sensitive to dose reduction. * Osteoporosis subjects could be differentiated even at 10% of original dose. * Radiation exposure should be considered when comparing quantitative bone parameters.",Excluded
408,"The usefulness of a prospective ECG gated CT angiography by 256 MDCT: Feasibility and image quality Purpose: To evaluate the usefulness of a prospectively gated transverseaxial scan (PGT) by 256-slice multidetector-row CT (MDCT) coronary angiography compared with a retrospectively gated helical scan (RGH) in patients with atypical chest pain who visited emergency room. Method(s): Between December 2009 and January 2010, among 70 consecutive patients with atypical chest pain who visited ER who performed with 256-slice CT scanner, we included the patients with heart rate (HR) of <= 75 bpm and HR variation <= 10 bpm. Therefore, we included 24 patients obtaining with PGT (mean age, 58.8+/-16.2 years; 12 men and 12 women) and 24 patients obtaining with RGH (mean age, 57.2+/-14.5 years; 12 men and 12 women). Scan was obtained from apex to kidney level. For each of 15 segments indentified according to the American Heart association's segmental model, image quality was evaluated by a radiologist using a four point grading scale: grade 4, excellent and no motion artifacts; grade 3, good and minor stairstep or motion artifacts; grade 2, moderate and presenting artifacts but still diagnostic; and grade 1, poor and not diagnostic. For each scan, radiation dose and additional extracardiac findings were estimated. Diagnostic accuracy was also evaluated the 2 patients performed conventional angiography. The image quality results between PGT and RGH scans were compared using Mann-Whitney Test. Result(s): No statistically significant differences were evident between these two groups in terms of clinical and demographic characteristics. The difference of image quality between PGT and RGH scans was not statistically significant (p = 0.5843). The image quality was regarded as grade 4 for most segments in both PGT (96.7%, 348/360) and RGH scans (98.9%, 356/360). Mean effective radiation dose was 10.4+/-1.2 mSv in patients with PGT as compared to 23.0+/-4.6 mSv in patients with RGH. Additional extracardiac findings are 10 cases in patients with PGT including lung nodule, thyroid nodule. Conclusion(s): Prospective ECG-gated CTA by using the PGT is useful for patients with atypical chest pain who visited ER because it can reduce radiation dose to 54.8% while maintaining image quality and diagnostic accuracy in patients with HR less than 75 bpm, and evaluate the coronary arteries, aorta, pulmonary arteries, and entire intra-thoracic structures at the same time.",Excluded
951,"Clinical trial of post-chemotherapy consolidation thoracic radiotherapy for extensive-stage small cell lung cancer Background and purpose: To define the rate of development of symptomatic chest failures in extensive stage small cell lung cancer (ES-SCLC) after undergoing post-chemotherapy chest radiotherapy (RT). Material(s) and Method(s): Patients had ES-SCLC, attained an objective response to chemotherapy and signed study consent. Target accrual was 33 patients. Patients were offered prophylactic cranial irradiation (PCI) as per department policy. PCI (25 Gy/10 fractions) and chest RT (40 Gy/15 fractions) were given simultaneously 4-8 weeks after chemotherapy completion. Thoracic target volume was the post-chemotherapy residual chest disease plus margin. Patients were evaluated for RT toxicities, local control, disease-free and overall survival. Result(s): Thirty-two patients were evaluable. Twenty-nine patients completed RT without delay. There were 4 complete responses and 28 partial responses to chemotherapy. All study patients received PCI. Maximal acute RT toxicity was grade 2 esophagitis (18 patients). There were no RT-related deaths. Median time to disease progression and overall survival were 4.2 and 8.3 months, respectively (median follow-up = 21.8 months). Of 16 chest recurrences, 7 were in the irradiated region and 5 were symptomatic. Conclusion(s): Post-chemotherapy consolidation chest RT for ES-SCLC patients on this trial was well tolerated and associated with symptomatic chest recurrences in only 5/32 treated patients. © 2011 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

1320,"Is the paradise in the Caribbean? Prevalence of hypovitaminosis D in HIV+ patients treated at a clinic in Puerto Rico Background: Existent studies have demonstrated that HIV+ population suffer from low bone density, increasing their risk of fractures, which has been linked to the use of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) and even HIV itself. Currently, there aren't studies published regarding vitamin D deficiency and insufficiency in HIV+ patients in the Caribbean (latitude 18degree00N 66degree37W). Our hypothesis is that HIV+ patients with or without HAART who live in the Caribbean have 25-hydroxyvitamin D severe deficiency (<=25 nmol/l), deficiency (<=50 nmol/l) or insufficiency (>50 nmol/l <=75 nmol/l). Methodology: A retrospective chart review was conducted among files from HIV+ adults >49 year managed at private clinic. A data collection tool was designed to gather demographic characteristics (age, gender, race/ethnicity), vitamin D levels, height, weight, body mass index (BMI), viral load, CD4 cell count, 25-OHD levels, time with HIV infection (date of diagnosis), AIDS defining illness, current or former IVDU, tobacco use, current ARV therapy (PI or NNRTI based), time on ARV (number of years since first ARV regimen), co-morbid conditions, multivitamin use, vitamin D supplementation used and dose, and other medications. Result(s): All patients were Hispanic, 62.8% men, and mean age was 57 years. Twenty-two patients (51%) had deficient/insufficient vitamin D levels vs 21 patients (49%) who had normal vitamin D levels. Among patients with vitamin D deficiency/insufficiency, 95.5% were taking ART; 68% were on a PI based regimen, and 32% on a non-PI based regimen. Eighteen patients (82%) with deficient/insufficient vitamin D levels had a BMI<30 vs 4 patients (18%) with a BMI>30. Ten patients (46%) with deficient/insufficient levels had a total daily intake of <=800 IU of vitamin D vs 6 patients (27%) which were taking a total daily intake of >800 IU of vitamin D; 6 (27%) patients with deficient/ insufficient levels were not taking any vitamin D supplementation. Four patients (18%) with deficiency/ insufficiency were currently smokers. Fifteen patients (68%) with deficiency/insufficiency had been infected for 1-10 years, 7 patients (32%) had been infected for more than 11 years. Conclusion(s): Inadequate vitamin D levels were highly prevalent among HIV+ patients treated at a clinic in the Caribbean. Although, location of the population is in the Caribbean, were there is no difference in the solar radiation between seasons, less than 50% of the HIV population had the sufficient vitamin D levels. Even in patients using more than 400 IU of vitamin D level per day, more than 50% of them had inadequate vitamin D levels. Additional studies in this area are needed to determine the necessary amount of vitamin D for the HIV infected patients to maintain sufficient vitamin D levels.",Excluded
223,"Personalized space radiation dosimetry using monte carlo simulations of CT-based geometries exposed to solar particle event radiation Purpose/Objective(s): A serious concern for space exploration to the Moon or Mars is astronaut exposure to ionizing radiation in a solar particle event (SPE). SPE are unpredictable, variable in intensity and energy spectrum, and are primarily protons with kinetic energies below 100 MeV. The dose from an SPE is highly inhomogeneous and sensitive to physical parameters such as energy spectrum, shielding, and anisotropy. The biological effects of low dose-rate proton radiation are not fully understood. Interpretation of data from ground-based experiments in animal models is complicated by inhomogeneous distribution of dose to sensitive organs. Planning and preparation for space exploration vitally relies on accurate prediction of the health risk associated with exposure to SPE. Materials/Methods: We have developed a Monte Carlo radiation transport tool that incorporates CT scans into dose calculations of radiobiological experiments in animal models and simulated exposure of humans to SPE radiation. This allows accurate predictions of SPE dose and is used to develop dose-toxicity data for pre-clinical animal experiments and for predicting astronaut organ doses from exposure to SPE radiation. Result(s): We validated this tool using phantom measurements and determine organ doses for Yucatan mini-pigs exposed to simulated SPE radiation designed to match 3 historical events with relatively low (October, 1989), intermediate (September, 1989) and high (August, 1972) levels of >100 MeV protons to model toxicity vs dose in critical internal organs. These studies show a paradoxical increase in clinical/systemic toxicity for SPE with lower internal dose that appears to correlate with suppression of leukocyte counts. For astronaut SPE exposures, we applied this tool to 4 different human model (2 male, 2 female) astronauts exposed to the 3 SPE in geometries designed to simulate exposure within a space suit or capsule. The results indicate that not only does an astronaut's dose to specific organs (e.g., skin, eyes, and lungs) differ substantially for different SPE, different astronauts receive significantly different organ doses even with the same SPE exposure. Conclusion(s): These studies clearly show the value of our dosimetry system for two critically interrelated uses: determining the dose to organ systems for SPE exposed astronauts and helping ensure that earth based experiments reproduce appropriate dose distributions in order to maximize the applicability of these findings. Our results suggest that a personalized approach for astronaut dosimetry may be valuable in determining the course of clinical action in the event of an SPE exposure.",Included
1875,"Establishing a local computed tomography dose reference level for adults based on acceptable quality dose approach Introduction The present study attempted to establish local Computed Tomography DRL by collecting radiation doses of the three most frequently performed CT examinations at our institute. The present study focuses on the local DRLs which are based on clinical indications as the main determinants of patient radiation dose in correlation with acceptable image quality within facility. Method The present study included a total 125 patient imaged on Helical MDCT Ingenuity (Philips Healthcare, Cleveland, USA) 42 detector rows 128 slice. The CT examinations performed were for CT head for acute stroke, routine chest CT and routine abdomen CT examinations. A set of common data was collected for each CT examinations such as patient ID, age, weight, beam width, rotational time, image quality score (IQS). The CT dose parameters displayed CTDIvol and DLP were also measured for scout image and diagnostic CT respectively during each single phase CT examination. The median value was calculated for individual clinical CT examination based on standard of adequate image quality. Results The patients underwent CT in this study were in the range of 25 to 70 years of age with mean +/- SD age (49.8 +/- 15.3). The medium DLP calculated was 1195.8 mGy.cm, 333.2 mGy.cm and 512.9 mGy.cm for acute stroke head, routine chest and routine abdomen CT examination respectively for IQS of 3. The scout image median DLP calculated was 4.2 mGy.cm, 3.8 mGy.cm and 3.7 mGy.cm for acute stroke head, routine chest and routine abdomen CT examination respectively for IQS of 3. Conclusion The purpose of this study was integration of DRL with clinical image quality. The optimization of doses was correlated with diagnostic adequacy of clinical image. Further the study is ongoing to collect data and categorize on the basis of different weight group to further optimize the dose index for CT.",Excluded
1956,"Myocardial perfusion imaging with a cadmium zinc telluride-based gamma camera versus invasive fractional flow reserve Purpose: Recently introduced ultrafast cardiac SPECT cameras with cadmium zinc telluride-based (CZT) detectors may provide superior image quality allowing faster acquisition with reduced radiation doses. Although the level of concordance between conventional SPECT and invasive fractional flow reserve (FFR) measurement has been studied, that between FFR and CZT-based SPECT is not yet known. Therefore, we aimed to assess the level of concordance between CZT SPECT and FFR in a large patient group with stable coronary artery disease. Method(s): Both invasive FFR and myocardial perfusion imaging with a CZT-based SPECT camera, using Tc-tetrofosmin as tracer, were performed in 100 patients with stable angina and intermediate grade stenosis on invasive coronary angiography. A cut-off value of <0.75 was used to define abnormal FFR. Result(s): The mean age of the patients was 64+/-11 years, and 64 % were men. SPECT demonstrated ischaemia in 31 % of the patients, and 20 % had FFR <0.75. The concordance between CZT SPECT and FFR was 73 % on a per-patient basis and 79 % on a per-vessel basis. Discordant findings were more often seen in older patients and were mainly (19 %) the result of ischaemic SPECT findings in patients with FFR >=0.75, whereas only 8 % had an abnormal FFR without ischaemia as demonstrated by CZT SPECT. Conclusion(s): Only 20 - 30 % of patients with intermediate coronary stenoses had significant ischaemia as assessed by CZT SPECT or invasive FFR. CZT SPECT showed a modest degree of concordance with FFR, which is comparable with previous results with conventional SPECT. Further investigations are particularly necessary in patients with normal SPECT and abnormal FFR, especially to determine whether these patients should undergo revascularization. © 2013 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.",Excluded

After a detailed and systematic study of configuration-interaction effects in both the target and the collision wavefunctions, it was found that an additional 21 configurations needed to be included in the CI expansion to obtain significantly more accurate target state and collision wavefunctions. A total of 1785 individual lines are considered over a wide range of electron temperatures, 30-100 000 K, of particular importance in astrophysical applications. A detailed comparison is made with a previous 3 configuration approximation and significant differences of up to a factor of 2 are reported at the lowest temperatures considered. The inclusion of the additional 3d54s2 and 3d54s4p levels in the present work together with the additional CI effects are found to cause significant changes to the total effective collision strengths for the low-lying transitions from the ground state, particularly at very low temperatures.

2097,"Gene-arsenic interaction in longitudinal changes of blood pressure: Findings from the Health Effects of Arsenic Longitudinal Study (HEALS) in Bangladesh Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide and mounting evidence indicates that toxicant exposures can profoundly impact on CVD risk. Epidemiologic studies have suggested that arsenic (As) exposure is positively related to increases in blood pressure (BP), a primary CVD risk factor. However, evidence of whether genetic susceptibility can modify the association between As and BP is lacking. In this study, we used mixed effect models adjusted for potential confounders to examine the interaction between As exposure from well water and potential genetic modifiers on longitudinal change in BP over approximately 7. years of follow-up in 1137 subjects selected from the Health Effects of Arsenic Longitudinal Study (HEALS) cohort in Bangladesh. Genotyping was conducted for 235 SNPs in 18 genes related to As metabolism, oxidative stress and endothelial function. We observed interactions between 44 SNPs with well water As for one or more BP outcome measures (systolic, diastolic, or pulse pressure (PP)) over the course of follow-up. The interaction between CYBA rs3794624 and well water As on annual PP remained statistically significant after correction for multiple comparisons (FDR-adjusted p for interaction = 0.05). Among individuals with the rs3794624 variant genotype, well water As was associated with a 2.23. mm. Hg (95% CI: 1.14-3.32) greater annual increase in PP, while among those with the wild type, well water As was associated with a 0.13. mm. Hg (95% CI: 0.02-0.23) greater annual increase in PP. Our results suggest that genetic variability may contribute to As-associated increases in BP over time.Copyright © 2015 Published by Elsevier Inc.",Excluded
1032,"Immune events associated with protection in C57BL/6 mice immunized with anti-idiotypic antibodies mimicking protective antigens shared between gamma-irradiated cercariae vaccine and human resistance model of Schistosoma haematobium Immunoregulation is central for successful manipulation of schistosomiasis. Unlike schistosome vaccine development strategies that relied on direct selection of antigens from crude responses leading to selection of mildly protective antigens, the present study tested the utility of selection of potentially protective antigens encompassed rounds of immunoregulation via idiotypic network. Anti-idiotypic antibodies (Ab2) were purified from sera of New Zealand white rabbits multiply immunized with gamma-irradiated cercariae of S. haematobium, using adult worm specific idiotypes (Ab1) purified from sera of subjects resistant to reinfection. Ab2 was used for immunization of C57BL/6 mice and consequences of immunization were monitored before and after challenge infection with S. haematobium. Results showed an increase of splenic T cell expression of intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) and very late antigen-4 (VLA-4) upon immunization (average % stimulated cells 54.9 vs. 20.4, P < 0.05 for ICAM-1 and 31.1 vs. 6.6, P < 0.01 for VLA-4) and challenge, especially at day 6 (83.5 vs. 45.6, P < 0.01) for ICAM-1 and day 10 (50.4 vs. 20.8, P < 0.05) for VLA-4. Thereafter, both adhesion molecules declined at day 28 through 90. Similarly, lymphoproliferation was manifested upon immunization (OD570-630 0.27 vs. 0.09, P < 0.01) and challenge at day 6 (0.5 vs. 0.17, P < 0.01) through day 10 (0.49 vs.0.18, P < 0.05), then declined at day 28 through 90. Moreover, sera of Ab2-immunized mice exhibited an anti-anti-ids (Ab3) reactivity against antigens of approximate molecular weight 40, 80 and 160 kDa of adult worms, which were also recognized by Ab1. However, in contrast to Ab1, Ab3 showed no surface binding to 3 hr schistosomula. Strikingly, mice immunized with Ab2 showed strong resistance to challenge infection (approximately 82% reduction in worm burden, P < 0.001). Taking all, this alternative vaccine development strategy appears to filter out non-protective antigens. Indeed Ab3 recognizes much fewer numbers of antigens, which passed through two rounds of immune regulation. These antigens appear to represent a significant proportion of the protective response in the gamma-irradiated cercariae vaccine and human resistance model as well, providing the basis for an alternative vaccine for schistosomiasis.",Excluded
1650,"Radiomic analysis in T2W and SPAIR T2W MRI: Predict treatment response to chemoradiotherapy in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma Background: To investigate the capability of radiomic analysis using T2-weighted (T2W) and spectral attenuated inversion-recovery T2-weighted (SPAIR T2W) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) for predicting the therapeutic response of esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) to chemoradiotherapy (CRT). Method(s): Pretreatment T2W- and SPAIR T2W-MRI of 68 ESCC patients (37 responders, 31 nonresponders) were analyzed. A number of 138 radiomic features were extracted from each image sequence respectively. Kruskal-Wallis test were performed to evaluate the capability of each feature on treatment response classification. Sensitivity and specificity for each of the studied features were derived using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis. Support vector machine (SVM) and artificial neural network (ANN) models were constructed based on the training set (23 responders, 20 nonresponders) for the prediction of treatment response, and then the testing set (14 responders, 11 nonresponders) validated the reliability of the models. Comparison between the performances of the models was performed by using McNemar's test. Result(s): Radiomic analysis showed significance in the prediction of treatment response. The analyses showed that complete responses (CRs) versus stable diseases (SDs), partial responses (PRs) versus SDs, and responders (CRs and PRs) versus nonresponders (SDs) could be differentiated by 26, 17, and 33 features (T2W: 11/11/15, SPAIR T2W: 15/6/18), respectively. The prediction models (ANN and SVM) based on features extracted from SPAIR T2W sequence (SVM: 0.929, ANN: 0.883) showed higher accuracy than those derived from T2W (SVM: 0.893, ANN: 0.861). No statistical difference was observed in the performance of the two classifiers (P=0.999).

There were 19 men and 18 women with a mean age of 67.6+/-11.7 (SD) years (range: 36-85 years) For each patient, volume CT dose index (CTDIvol), size-specific dose estimates (SSDE) and signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) were evaluated at each anatomic level (lung, breast, liver and pelvis area) for each protocol. Two radiologists assessed independently image quality, artifacts and diagnostic confidence., RESULTS: The radiation dose decreased significantly using Liver DRI compared to standard automatic exposure control on the total scan length, lung, breast and pelvis area, with a significant CTDIvol reduction of 27% (P=0.0001), 23% (P=0.0002), 24% (P=0.0002) and 31% (P=0.0001), respectively; and a significant SSDE reduction of 23% (P=0.0001), 28% (P=0.0001), 23% (P=0.0002) and 29% (P=0.0001), respectively. No significant SNR reductions were observed in all measured tissues at the level of the aortic arch, celiac trunk and iliac bifurcation, except in the muscle (P=0.0013) and fat tissue (P=0.0052) at the level of the ureteral meatus. No significant differences were noted between both protocols in overall image quality, artifacts and diagnostic confidence with an excellent inter observer agreement between radiologists (Kappa values of 0.83, 0.85 and 0.88, respectively)., CONCLUSION: Liver DRI organ based dose modulation technique allows significant dose reduction compared to standard automatic exposure control while preserving diagnostic image quality in all thoraco-abdominopelvic areas.

The purpose of this study was to measure the dose of radiation delivered to the cochlea during a Gamma knife surgery (GKS) procedure for treatment of patients with vestibular schwannomas (VSs), and to analyze the relationship between cochlear irradiation and the hearing outcome of these patients. Methods. Eighty-two patients with VSs were treated with GKS using a marginal dose of 12 Gy. No patient had neurofibromatosis Type 2 disease, and all had a Gardner-Robertson hearing class of I to IV before treatment, and a radiological and audiological follow-up of at least 1-year after GKS. The dosimetric data of the volume of the cochlea were retrospectively analyzed and were correlated with the auditory outcome of patients. Results. The mean radiation dose delivered to the cochlear volume ranged from 1.30 to 10.00 Gy (median 4.15 Gy). The cochlea received significantly higher radiation doses in patients with worsening of hearing after GKS. A highly significant association between the cochlear and the intracanalicular dose of radiation delivered during GKS was found. Conclusions. During GKS for VSs, relatively high doses of radiation can be delivered to the cochlea. Worsening of hearing after GKS can be the consequence of either radiation injury to the cochlea or the irradiation dose delivered into the auditory canal, or both.",Excluded
1971,"Consolidation radiotherapy in patients with advanced Hodgkin's lymphoma: survival data from the UKLG LY09 randomized controlled trial (ISRCTN97144519) PURPOSE: This study analyzed the outcomes of nonrandomized consolidation radiotherapy (RT) given after chemotherapy in the initial treatment of advanced Hodgkin's lymphoma (HL). The results were collected prospectively within a randomized controlled trial of induction chemotherapy., PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients were randomly assigned between doxorubicin, bleomycin, vinblastine, and dacarbazine and one of two prespecified multidrug regimens. At least six cycles of chemotherapy were planned, with up to eight for patients showing slower response. Involved-field RT was recommended for incomplete response to chemotherapy or bulk disease at presentation. The primary outcome measure was progression-free survival (PFS), landmarked from the end of chemotherapy., RESULTS: Among 807 patients randomly assigned, 702 achieved objective response. Postchemotherapy RT for consolidation was reported in 300 (43%). With median follow-up of 6.9 years, 161 PFS events and 83 deaths were reported. Baseline characteristics showed more patients with bulk disease having RT (190 [63%] v 111 [28%]) and only partial response after chemotherapy (150 [50%] v 36 [9%]). Other baseline characteristics were similar. PFS was superior for patients having RT (hazard ratio [HR], 0.43; 95% CI, 0.30 to 0.60) with 5-year PFS 71% without RT, 86% with RT. A similar advantage was seen for overall survival (HR, 0.47; 95% CI, 0.29 to 0.77). There was no evidence of heterogeneity of treatment effect across subgroups., CONCLUSION: Patients who received consolidation RT apparently had better outcomes, consistently across all prognostic groups which persisted in multivariate analysis. This suggests that RT contributes significantly to the cure rate for advanced HL, although patient selection for combined modality treatment requires better definition in prospective trials.",Excluded
3439,"Late effects in ankylosing spondylitis patients treated with 224Ra This study is comprised of 1577 ankylosing spondylitis patients from 9 German hospitals who have been treated with multiple injections of 224Ra. The majority of the patients, most of them treated in the years 1948-1975, received one series of 10 weekly intravenous injections of about 1 MBq of 224Ra each. This dose leads to a mean absorbed dose due to alpha-particle radiation of 0.56 Gy to the marrow-free skeleton of a 70-kg man (mean bone surface dose of about 5 Gy). To provide comparative information on causes of death and on health effects possibly related to the basic disease itself, a control group of 1462 ankylosing spondylitis patients with roughly the same age distribution has been established. By the end of 1998, 649 patients in the exposed group and 762 control patients had died. Among other observations, it is of particular interest that 13 cases of leukemia in the exposed group have been observed. This is a highly significant excess (P < 0.001) compared to a standard population, but only a marginally significant excess in comparison to the seven cases observed in the control group. Subclassification of the leukemias shows a clear preponderance of the myeloid leukemias in the exposed group (8 cases observed compared to 1.7 cases expected, P < 0.001), whereas in the control group the observed cases are within the expected range for myeloid leukemia (3 cases observed compared to 2.2 cases expected, P = 0.3). The 224Ra cohort of the earlier study (higher-dose group) has provided a risk coefficient that predicts about 8 excess malignant bone tumors for the irradiated cohort in this study.

476,"Increased radiation from Chernobyl decreases the expression of red colouration in natural populations of bank voles (Myodes glareolus) Pheomelanin is a pink to red version of melanin pigment deposited in skin and hair. Due to its bright colour, pheomelanin plays a crucial function in signalling, in particular sexual signalling. However, production of pheomelanin, as opposed to its dark alternative, eumelanin, bears costs in terms of consumption of antioxidants important for protection of DNA against naturally produced reactive oxidative species. Therefore, decreased expression of pheomelanin is expected in organisms exposed to severe oxidative stress such as that caused by exposure to chronic ionizing radiation. We tested if variable exposure to radiation among natural populations of bank voles Myodes glareolus in Chernobyl affected expression of red colouration in their dorsal fur. The relative redness of dorsal fur was positively correlated with weight, but also negatively correlated with the level of background radiation. These results suggest that the development of the natural red colouration in adult bank voles is affected by ionizing background radiation, and potentially causing elevated levels of oxidative stress. Reduced production of pheomelanin allows more antioxidants to mitigate the oxidative stress caused by radiation. However, changing natural animal colouration for physiological reasons can have ecological costs, if e.g. it causes mismatch with habitat colouration and conspicuousness for predators.",Included

In this study, we evaluated the efficacy of intensity-modulated arc therapy (IMAT) for total bone marrow irradiation. Materials/Methods: Three patients who received total marrow irradiation with helical tomotherapy, two females and one male, were selected for this dosimetric study. Each patient had one CT scan with normal breathing from the skull to the mid-thigh, and two CT scans at the end of the expiration and inspiration phases. Contours for target volumes and normal organs were drawn to take into account breathing effects. The target volumes included the bone volume from the skull to the mid-thigh, lymph nodes, and spleen. 12 Gy in 8 fractions was prescribed to the target volumes. Varian RapidArc IMAT plans were generated with the same target volumes as the helical tomotherapy plans. For each patient, 23 normal structures were included in plan optimization, including all the major organs in the body. In helical tomotherapy plans, 5 cm jaw width was used. For IMAT planning, eight arc fields were used for each patient to cover the entire target volumes, with the isocenters aligned along the superior-inferior axis. Both the helical tomotherapy and IMAT plans were normalized to cover 85% of the bone volume by 12 Gy. Result(s): The average values of themean doses to the normal organswere 6.0 Gy, 6.0 Gy, and 5.8Gy in helical tomotherapy plans for the three patients; they were 4.8 Gy, 5.4 Gy, and 5.2 Gy, respectively, in IMAT plans. Of the 63 organs that could be compared pairwise, 43 had lower means using IMATand 17 had lowermeans using tomotherapy.Of the 40 organ pairs whose mean doses differed bymore than 10%, 33 had lower means in IMAT plans.D10 (theminimumdose level covering 10%of the volume) for the bone volume were 13.5 Gy, 13.1 Gy, and 13.5 Gy in helical tomotherapy plans for the three patients, respectively; they were 13.7 Gy, 14.4Gy, and 14.3Gy in IMAT plans. Comparable dose coveragewas achieved by IMAT plans for other target volumes. The average beam-on timewas 19.4minutes for helical tomotherapy and approximately 16 minutes for IMAT. Planning time excluding contouring was approximately 4h for each method. The average monitor unit (MU) in helical tomotherapy plans was 17,207 MU; it was 4,916 MU in IMAT plans. Conclusion(s): Compared to helical tomotherapy plans, IMAT plans showed consistent improvement in sparing of normal organs while delivering a somewhat less homogeneous dose to the target volumes for total bone marrow irradiation. This study indicates that IMAT can be used effectively for total bone marrow irradiation. With either treatment lower extremities are most efficiently treated with conventional open fields.",Excluded
3588,"Alterations in expression and structure of the DNA repair gene XRCC1 The repair-associated gene XRCC1 was previously cloned by complementing the hamster mutant EM9, which has a high rate of spontaneous SCE and hypersensitivity to DNA damaging agents. In analyzing XRCC1 gene expression, similar levels of steady-state mRNA were found in normal cells, Bloom's syndrome cells with altered SCE, and in squamous carcinoma cells with differential X-ray sensitivity. An EcoRI restriction fragment-length polymorphism previously identified in XRCC1 did not correlate with the repair phenotypes of these cells. The mRNA of XRCC1 decreased to 20-40% after treatment of cells with a DNA damaging agent. XRCC1 also showed tissue specific expression in rats. The mRNA levels were high in testis (7-8 fold), ovary (3-4 fold) and brain (4-5 fold), when compared with those in intestine, liver and spleen (1-2 fold). These data and the high levels of XRCC1 protein detected in testis indicate that XRCC1 may play an important role in DNA processing during meiogenesis and recombination in germ cells.",Excluded
735,"Waiting times for radiotherapy: variation over time and between cancer networks in southeast England The aim of this study was to investigate variations in the length of time that patients with cancer wait from diagnosis to treatment with radiotherapy. A total of 57,426 men and 71,018 women diagnosed with cancer between 1992 and 2001 and receiving radiotherapy within 6 months of diagnosis were identified from the Thames Cancer Registry database. In total, 12 sites were identified for which a substantial number or proportion of patients received radiotherapy: head and neck, oesophagus, colon, rectum, lung, nonmelanoma skin cancer, breast, uterus, prostate, bladder, brain and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. Median waiting times from diagnosis to radiotherapy were calculated, together with the proportion of patients who received radiotherapy within 60 days of diagnosis, and analysed by year of diagnosis, cancer site, deprivation quintile, age at diagnosis, sex and cancer network of either residence or treatment. Logistic regression was used to adjust the proportion receiving treatment within 60 days for the effects of the other factors. There were significant differences in the proportions receiving radiotherapy within 60 days between different networks and different cancer sites, which remained after adjustment. Median waiting times varied from 42 to 65 days across networks of residence, with the adjusted proportion treated within 60 days ranging from 44 to 71%. There was no difference between male and female patients after adjustment for the other factors, particularly site. There was a highly significant trend over time: the median wait increased from 45 days in 1992 to 76 days in 2001, while the adjusted proportion being treated within 60 days declined by almost a half, from 64 to 35%, over the same period.",Excluded

A single radiologist with more than 15 years of experience in chest-imaging evaluated the presence and extent of alveolar opacities, reticulations, and/or pleural effusion. The percentage of lung involvement (range <25 % to 75-100 %) was also calculated. We stratified patients in groups according to the time interval between symptoms onset and X-ray imaging (<= 5 and > 5 days) and according to age (<= 50 and > 50 years old)., RESULTS: A total of 518 patients were enrolled. Overall 314 patients had negative and 204 had positive RT-PCR results. Lung lesions in patients with SARS-Cov2 pneumonia primarily manifested as alveolar and interstitial opacities and were mainly bilateral (60.8 %). Lung abnormalities were more frequent and more severe by symptom duration and by increasing age. The sensitivity and specificity of chest X-ray at admission in the overall cohort were 57 % (95 % CI=47-67) and 89 % (83-94), respectively. Sensitivity was higher for patients with symptom onset > 5 days compared to <= 5 days (76 % [62-87] vs 37 % [24-52]) and in patients > 50 years old compared to <= 50 years (59 % [48-69] vs 47 % [23-72]), at the expense of a slightly lower specificity (68 % [45-86] and 82 % [73-89], respectively)., CONCLUSIONS: Overall chest X-ray sensitivity for SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia was 57 %. Sensitivity was higher when symptoms had started more than 5 days before, at the expense of lesser specificity, while slightly higher in older patients in comparison to younger ones.

2046,"Some radiation effects on segregation in Drosophila Translocation induced in the immature oocyte, in meiotic prophase, affects division I orientation and segregation, the usual result being that the two halves of translocations are directed to opposite poles. Since interchange is usually (if not exclusively) between chromatids, this is to be expected from the creation of illegitimate conjunctions. Good agreement is obtained between patterns of segregations deduced from recovered half-translocation bearing exceptions and the kinds of disomic gametes expected as alternative recoveries from the same division I configurations. Inferences drawn from the study of compound-X females have been found to apply as well in the case of females of normal karyotype. Numerical errors occur predominantly, possibly exclusively, in division I. The rate of induced nondisjunction of specific chromosome pairs varies in relation to the structure of the entire complement, as required if radiation-induced nondisjunction is interchange dependent, but which would be unexpected if the mechanism involved effects on individual spindle fibers, chromosomes, or chromosomal bivalents.",Excluded

747,"Dose-escalation with CHARTWEL (continuous hyperfractionated accelerated radiotherapy week-end less) combined with neo-adjuvant chemotherapy in the treatment of locally advanced non-small cell lung cancer PURPOSE: a radiation-dose-escalation study was undertaken to assess the therapeutic benefit of combining accelerated hyperfractionated radiotherapy (RT) with neo-adjuvant chemotherapy (CT) in non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC)., MATERIALS AND METHODS: One hundred and thirteen patients with locally advanced NSCLC were entered into a phase II trial of CHARTWEL (CHART Week-End-Less) 54 Gy or 60 Gy with or without three cycles of CT. Acute oesophageal reactions and analgesia were scored for up to 8 weeks after the start of RT. Pneumonitis, lung fibrosis, spinal cord and oesophageal strictures, were assessed using clinical and radiological criteria from 3 months onwards and throughout the study. Haematological and gastrointestinal toxicity was monitored in those patients undergoing CT. Endpoints for treatment outcome were overall survival, disease-free survival and loco-regional control., RESULTS: Chemotherapy enhanced the incidence and duration of acute dysphagia,but the increase was transient. Healing occurred in all cases and there has been no evidence of long-term oesophageal complications. Clinically, almost 25% of those receiving CT+RT had Grade 2 pneumonitis, higher than seen with RT alone. However, the 1 patient with severe Grade 3 pneumonitis was in the RT 60 Gy alone group. An incidence of 17% Grade 2 pulmonary fibrosis at 2 years was seen with CT, slightly lower than with RT alone. To date, there is no evidence of Grade 3 lung fibrosis. There was a higher scoring of lung damage with the radiological endpoint, which gave no indication that CT increased pulmonary toxicity over that of RT alone. Loco-regional control at 2 years was 37% and 55% for CHARTWEL 54 Gy and 60 Gy alone compared with 72% in those treated with 60 Gy and neo-adjuvant CT However, this did not translate into a survival advantage., CONCLUSIONS: This study of CHARTWEL combined with induction chemotherapy, has shown that the strategy is feasible and that a possible therapeutic benefit may be obtained by the addition of CT. Although neo-adjuvant treatment increased acute mucosal reactions and slight-to-moderate pneumonitis seen with CHARTWEL 60 Gy, the clinical management and quality of life of these patients is similar to those treated with radiotherapy alone.",Excluded
3675,"The outcomes of one-stage treatment for multiple knee ligament injuries combined with extensor apparatus rupture Background: Multiple knee ligament injuries combined with extensor apparatus rupture are serious and complex knee injuries that are rare in clinical practice. The management is extremely challenging and controversial. The aim of this study is to describe a patient collective with multiple knee ligament injuries combined with extensor apparatus injuries in detail and to report the mid-term outcomes of a one-stage surgical treatment regarding subjective outcome scores, complications, knee instability, and ROM. Method(s): Eleven of 425 patients with multiple knee ligament injuries combined with extensor apparatus injuries admitted to our hospital were reviewed from July 2008 to May 2017. All patients underwent one-stage repair and reconstruction of multiple knee ligaments and extensor apparatus. The Lysholm knee score and the International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) score were adopted to evaluate the surgical effect preoperatively and at a minimum of 2 years' follow-up. Clinical data, including range of motion and knee stability, were also recorded at the final follow-up. Result(s): Ten patients were followed up with a mean time of 40 (range, 24-60) months. At the last follow-up, 8 patients had joint flexion range of motion greater than or equal to120 degrees, 2 patients had joint flexion range of motion of 100-120 degrees, and 1 patient had active knee extension limitation of 5 degrees. Stress radiographs showed that the mean differences in posterior displacement were reduced from 10.8 +/- 3.0 mm preoperatively to 2.0 +/- 2.5 mm at the last follow-up. There were significant improvements in stress radiographs from pre- to postoperative states for all patients with multiple knee ligament injuries. The Lysholm score ranged from 85 to 96, with a mean of 92.1 (compared with 33 before surgery, P < 0.05). The final IKDC scores were A in 2 patients (20%), B in 7 (70%), and C in 1 (10%). Nine of the 10 patients (90%) returned to their former activity level. Conclusion(s): Multiple knee ligament injuries combined with extensor apparatus rupture are rare. Single-stage management of the repair and reconstruction of multiple knee ligaments and extensor apparatus with proper rehabilitation is an effective and reliable procedure to restore knee stability and function.

1407,"Empty peek cages in ACDF: Does partial titanium coating improve the radiographic fusion? BACKGROUND CONTEXT: Anterior cervical discectomy and fusion (ACDF) is an effective standard surgical treatment for radiculopathy and myelopathy. Polyetheretherketone (PEEK) is a popular and advantageous material for the cages used in ACDF, but clinical studies have shown that radiographic fusion is slower with PEEK cages than with titanium cages. In a previous large prospective multicenter study, we showed that empty PEEK cages have slow and insufficient radiographic fusion and that failure to achieve complete radiographic fusion results in less improvement in pain and disability. It was hypothesized that a PEEK cage coated with titanium on the top and bottom surfaces would achieve better radiographic fusion rates than an otherwise identical uncoated PEEK cage. PURPOSE: To determine if a PEEK cage with a titanium coating on the top and bottom surfaces achieves better radiographic fusion than an identical PEEK cage without any titanium coating. STUDY DESIGN/SETTING: Prospective multicenter single-arm clinical trial, with matched controls from another prospective multicenter singlearm clinical trial. PATIENT SAMPLE: Fifty patients receiving single-level ACDF, for radiculopathy or myelopathy at a single level C3-4 to C7-T1, and 50 matched controls selected from a similar clinical trial. This interim analysis presents results from the first 28 cases and 50 controls, and the presentation at the Annual Meeting will present the full final results of all 50 patients and 50 controls. OUTCOME MEASURES: Radiographic fusion was assessed on X-ray images by two independent investigators for three aspects-bony bridging, subsidence/migration, and range of motion, yielding a 0-7 score, with scores of 6 and 7 defined as ""complete fusion."" Clinical outcomes included Visual Analog Scale (VAS) for pain, Neck Disability Index (NDI) for functioning, and Odom's criterion. METHOD(S): Single-level ACDF was performed using stand-alone empty PEEK cages with versus without titanium coating on the top and bottom surfaces, without postoperative bracing. Follow-up assessments were made at 6, 12, and 18 months. RESULT(S): The rate of complete fusion for PEEK+Ti cages versus uncoated PEEK controls was: 50.0% vs 40.0% at 6 months, 75.0% vs 72.0% at 12 months, and 78.5% vs 84.0% at 18 months, and there was no statistically significant difference between these rates. There was also no statistically significant difference between the two groups for the amount of subsidence at any follow-up. Pain (VAS) and functioning (NDI) improved in both groups with no statistically significant difference between them. The fusion status correlated significantly (p<.05) with VAS at 6 and 18 months and with NDI at 12 and 18 months. The Odom's criterion at 18 months was the same in both groups: ""good"" or ""excellent"" for 89% of PEEK+Ti patients vs 90% for PEEK patients (p=.90). CONCLUSION(S): This interim analysis from our study rejects our hypothesis that titanium coating of PEEK cages at the bearing surface (cage/ vertebra interface) would improve the low fusion rate of empty PEEK cages: neither the speed nor the ultimate frequency of fusion was significantly different between the cases and matched controls. Our study suggests that endplate/interface coating alone does not improve fusion. Perhaps a possible immune response to the remaining uncovered PEEK at the lateral and inner cage surfaces may be a reason for the slow and insufficient rate of fusion. PEEK cages fully coated with titanium should be tested next.",Excluded
1329,"Impact of Significant Coronary Artery Calcification Reported on Low-Dose Computed Tomography Lung Cancer Screening BACKGROUND: Coronary artery calcification (CAC) is a common and important incidental finding in low-dose computed tomography (LDCT) performed for lung cancer screening (LCS). The impact of these incidental findings on patient management is unclear., PURPOSE: The goals of our study were to determine the impact of reporting CAC on patient management and to determine whether standardized reporting of CAC affects the likelihood of future interventions., METHODS: In this IRB-approved retrospective study, we queried our LCS database for reports of LDCT performed between January 2016 and September 2018. All reports with significant findings of CAC designated with the letter ""S"" for any Lung-RADS category were selected. The grading of CAC was extracted from the reports. Medical records were reviewed for each patient to determine demographics, clinical history, medications, and cardiac-related diagnostic and interventional procedures. The changes in management after the report of significant CAC on LDCT were documented. Statistical analysis with Student t test and Pearson chi test was performed., RESULTS: A total of 756/3110 patients (mean age: 67+/-6.4 y; M=466, 61.6%: F=290, 38.4%) were reported to have significant CAC on LDCT for LCS. Of them, 236/756 patients (31.2%) had established coronary artery disease (CAD) at baseline, before the initial LDCT. A change in management was observed in 155/756 patients (20.5%). The most common changes in management included the following: alteration in medication regimen (n=114/155, 73.5%), stress testing (n=65/155, 41.9%), and referral to a cardiologist (36/155, 23.2%). Percutaneous coronary intervention (4, 2.6%) and surgery (3, 1.9%) were uncommon. Changes in management were more common in those without established CAD and in those whose CAC was semiquantitatively graded (35% vs. 25%, P=0.02)., CONCLUSION: CAC is a common significant finding in LDCT for LCS. Reporting of CAC in patients with nonestablished CAD and semiquantitative assessment resulted in changes in management.",Excluded

This study was performed to evaluate its efficacy and safety., METHODOLOGY: Thirteen patients with 17 nodules of unresectable HCC were subjected to PMCT under ultrasonic guidance. The tumors ranged from 1.2-4.4 cm in size. Assessment of the efficacy of PMCT was made by follow-up with dynamic computed tomography (CT)., RESULTS: In the patients with small HCC ( or = 2.1 cm), 5 out of 7 nodules developed local recurrence after PMCT. Regarding assessment of the necrotic area after PMCT, dynamic CT revealed enhancement that was possibly caused by congestion of the liver parenchyma surrounding the area of necrosis due to PMCT in the early phase of the treatment. Therefore, the necrotic area must be assessed carefully. Although a slight heat sensation and/or pain during microwave irradiation (a common effect of PMCT) occurred in all patients, there were no serious adverse effects., CONCLUSIONS: Complete remission of small HCC ( or = 2.1 cm). There were no serious adverse effects from PMCT and the therapy can be safely carried out even in patients with poor liver function.",Excluded
3402,"A statewide teleradiology system reduces radiation exposure and charges in transferred trauma patients BACKGROUND: Trauma transfer patients routinely undergo repeat imaging because of inefficiencies within the radiology system. In 2009, the virtual private network (VPN) telemedicine system was adopted throughout Oregon allowing virtual image transfer between hospitals. The startup cost was a nominal $3,000 per hospital., METHODS: A retrospective review from 2007 to 2012 included 400 randomly selected adult trauma transfer patients based on a power analysis (200 pre/200 post). The primary outcome evaluated was reduction in repeat computed tomography (CT) scans. Secondary outcomes included cost savings, emergency department (ED) length of stay (LOS), and spared radiation. All data were analyzed using Mann-Whitney U and chi-square tests. P less than .05 indicated significance. Spared radiation was calculated as a weighted average per body region, and savings was calculated using charges obtained from Oregon Health and Science University radiology current procedural terminology codes., RESULTS: Four-hundred patients were included. Injury Severity Score, age, ED and overall LOS, mortality, trauma type, and gender were not statistically different between groups. The percentage of patients with repeat CT scans decreased after VPN implementation: CT abdomen (13.2% vs 2.8%, P < .01) and cervical spine (34.4% vs 18.2%, P < .01). Post-VPN, the total charges saved in 2012 for trauma transfer patients was $333,500, whereas the average radiation dose spared per person was 1.8 mSV. Length of stay in the ED for patients with Injury Severity Score less than 15 transferring to the ICU was decreased (P < .05)., CONCLUSIONS: Implementation of a statewide teleradiology network resulted in fewer total repeat CT scans, significant savings, decrease in radiation exposure, and decreased LOS in the ED for patients with less complex injuries. The potential for health care savings by widespread adoption of a VPN is significant. Copyright © 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.",Excluded

In the Netherlands, we initiated a multicenter, phase II study, of the combination of four cycles of carboplatin (AUC 5), paclitaxel (200 mg m(-2)) and etoposide (2 x 50 mg orally for 5 days) combined with 45 Gy (daily fractions of 1.8 Gy). The radiation was given to the involved field and concurrently with the second and third chemotherapy cycle. Patients with a partial or complete response received prophylactic cranial irradiation to a dose of 30 Gy. From January 1999 to December 2001, 37 of the 38 patients with LS-SCLC entered were eligible for toxicity analysis and response. Grade 3 and 4 haematological toxicity occurred in 57% (21/37) with febrile neutropenia in 24% (9/37). There were no treatment-related deaths or other grade 4 toxicity. Grade 3 toxicities were oesophagitis (27%), radiation pneumonitis (6%), anorexia (14%), nausea (16%), dyspnea (19%) and lethargy (22%). The objective response rate was 92% (95% confidence interval (CI) 80-98%) with a median survival time of 19.5 months (95% CI 12.8-29.2). The 1-, 2- and 5-year survival rate was 70, 47 and 27%, respectively. In field local recurrences occurred in six patients. Distant metastases were observed in 19 patients of which 13 in the brain.

3423,"Neoadjuvant stereotactic body radiation therapy, capecitabine, and liver transplantation for unresectable hilar cholangiocarcinoma Hilar cholangiocarcinoma (CCA) is a difficult malignancy to treat surgically because of its anatomical location and its frequent association with primary sclerosing cholangitis. Neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy followed by liver transplantation in lymph node-negative patients has been advanced by select liver transplant centers for the treatment of patients with unresectable disease. This approach has most commonly used external-beam radiotherapy in combination with biliary brachytherapy and 5-fluorouracil-based chemotherapy. Our center recently embarked on a protocol using stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) followed by capecitabine in lymph node-negative patients until liver transplantation. We, therefore, retrospectively determined the tolerability and pathological response in this pilot study. During a 3-year period, 17 patients with unresectable hilar CCA were evaluated for treatment under this protocol. In all, 12 patients qualified for neoadjuvant therapy and were treated with SBRT (50-60 Gy in 3-5 fractions over the course of 2 weeks). After 1 week of rest, capecitabine was initiated at 1330 mg/m2/day, and it was continued until liver transplantation. During neoadjuvant therapy, there were 35 adverse events in all, with cholangitis and palmar-plantar erythrodysesthesia being the most common. Capecitabine dose reductions were required on 5 occasions. Ultimately, 9 patients were listed for transplantation, and 6 patients received a liver transplant. The explant pathology of hilar tumors showed at least a partial treatment response in 5 patients, with extensive tumor necrosis and fibrosis noted. Additionally, high apoptotic indices and low proliferative indices were measured during histological examinations. Eleven transplant-related complications occurred, and the 1-year survival rate after transplantation was 83%. In this pilot study, neoadjuvant therapy with SBRT, capecitabine, and liver transplantation for unresectable CCA demonstrated acceptable tolerability.

Method(s): Simulations were used to evaluate the spectral separation of the low- and high-energy spectra and detective quantum efficiency was used for assessing image quality. Scan parameters were chosen to optimize spectral separation, image quality, and radiation dose. We introduce the measurement of volumetric BMD (vBMD) using basis material decomposition. We assess the accuracy of our methods by comparing measurements taken using bone images against reference data derived from subsequent incineration of the bones. In vivo scans were conducted to evaluate the system precision (repeatability) and agreement with a clinical densitometer. Result(s): Average errors for bone mineral content (BMC), areal BMD (aBMD), and vBMD were 4.85%, 5.49%, and 12.77%, respectively. Our system had good agreement with a clinical densitometer based on concordance correlation coefficient values of 0.92 and 0.98 for aBMD and BMC, respectively. Precision studies yielded coefficient of variation (CV) values of 1.35% for aBMD, 1.48% for BMC, and 1.80% for vBMD. The CV values of all measurements were within 2%, indicating that the methods have clinically acceptable precision. Conclusion(s): We conclude that our techniques yield bone measurements with high accuracy, clinically acceptable precision, and good agreement with a clinical densitometer.

1095,"Quantification and characterization of radical production in human, animal and 3D skin models during sun irradiation measured by EPR spectroscopy Sun radiation is indispensable to our health, however, a long term and high exposure could lead to erythema, premature skin aging and promotion of skin tumors. An underlying pathomechanism is the formation of free radicals. First, reactive oxygen species (*OH, *O2 -) and then, secondary lipid oxygen species (C centered radicals, CCR) are formed. A high amount of free radicals results in oxidative stress with subsequent cell damage. In dermatological research different skin models are used, however, comparative data about the cutaneous radical formation are missing. In this study, the radical formation in porcine-, (SKH-1) murine-, human- ex vivo skin and reconstructed human skin (RHS) were investigated during simulated sun irradiation (305-2200 nm), with X-band EPR spectroscopy. The amount of radical formation was investigated with the spin probe PCA exposed to a moderate sun dose below one minimal erythema dose (MED, ~25 mJ/cm2 UVB) in all skin models. Furthermore, the *OH and *CCR radical concentrations were measured with the spin trap DMPO within 0-4 MED (porcine-, human skin and RHS). The highest amount of radicals was found in RHS followed by murine and porcine, and the lowest amount in human ex vivo skin. In all skin models, more *OH than CCR radicals were found at 0-4 MED. Additionally, this work addresses the limitations in the characterization with the spin trap DMPO. The measurements have shown that the most comparable skin model to in vivo human skin could differ depending on the focus of the investigation. If the amount of radial production is regarded, RHS seems to be in a similar range like in vivo human skin. If the investigation is focused on the radical type, porcine skin is most comparable to ex vivo human skin, at an irradiation dose not exceeding 1 MED. Here, no comparison to in vivo human skin is possible.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.",Excluded
2031,"Comparison of effective radiation dose between low-and conventional-dose protocols in patients undergoing diagnostic coronary angiography: A randomized blinded comparison Background: Radiation exposure to the patient during coronary angiography or intervention is relatively high and considered to be potentially harmful. However, there is little data about the reduction strategy of radiation hazard. Purpose(s):We intended to evaluate the feasibility and effectiveness of low dose radiation protocols compared to current conventional dose protocols in the patients during diagnostic coronary angiography. Method(s): From February 2015 to October 2015, one hundred three consecutive patients (66.2+/-12.3 years old, 46 women (44.7%) who undertook diagnostic coronary angiography using Artis zeeTM angiography system were enrolled. After randomization of low- or conventional radiation dose protocols (LDP versus CDP), The patient underwent coronary angiography according to the standard angiography method (AP-Caudal, RAO-caudal, RAO-cranial, and LAO-cranial views of each 30 degrees, and spider view of 50 degrees and 30 degrees). The LDP consists of 10 frame rate (FR) per second during fluoroscopy and 40% reduced dose of conventional dose during cineangiography. The radial approach was used in all the procedures. We analyzed and compared the dose-area product (DAP: muGy m2), air-kerma (AK: mGy), exposure time (seconds), and FR between the LDP and CDP group. Result(s): Firstly, there is no significant interference to evaluate the coronary artery status by eyeball estimation between both groups. There are no significant basic demographics between the groups including age, body mass index or waist circumferences. Body weight is well correlated with the level of DAP and AK (gamma=0.27, p=0.006 and gamma=0.29, p=0.008 respectively). Marvelously, there are markedly reduction of effective radiation dose in the LDP group compared to CDP group (DAP, 1087.8+/-612.5 vs. 2188.2+/-949.4 muGy m2; AK, 171.5+/-111.6 vs. 348.1+/-178.3 mGy, p<0.001) by Mann-Whitney test, while on the similar total radiation exposure time (50.7+/-21.1 vs. 52.0+/-19.6 sec, p=0.739), FR (662.2+/-197.0 vs. 685.6+/-211.1, p=0.695), and image counts (10.1+/-2.0 vs. 10.7+/-3.5 images) by student t-test. Conclusion(s): The use of low dose radiation protocol was associated with nearly half amount reduction in exposure to patients undergoing diagnostic angiography without any significant loss of diagnostic information by eyeball estimation. It might provide another strategy to protect the patients and medical workers from potential radiation hazard in the catheterization room. (Figure Presented).",Excluded
504,"Regulation of the metastasis of murine ocular melanoma by natural killer cells In the current study we examine parameters affecting the metastasis of ocular tumors of in vivo derived B16F10 melanoma. In C57BL/6J beige (bg/bg) mice, with low NK activity, metastasis to the lungs was increased and survival time decreased. In C57BL/6J normal (+/+) mice treatment with PK136, a highly specific monoclonal anti-NK antibody (Ab), caused a depletion of NK cytotoxic activity, as demonstrated using a standard 51Cr release assay. In animals bearing ocular tumors, treatment with PK136 Ab resulted in significantly increased pulmonary metastasis and an altered pattern of metastasis. The effect of combined treatment protocols using LS2616 (linomide) and cyclophosphamide (Cy) was examined in enucleated and unenucleated animals. Treatment with LS2616 and Cy resulted in a significant decrease in mean pulmonary metastases (MPM), a decreased frequency of metastasis to the submandibular lymph nodes and an increase in mean survival time. In enucleated mice this combined treatment protocol resulted in apparent cures, the lowest MPM and the longest survival time observed. When tumor-bearing mice were treated with either silica, carrageenan or sublethal gamma irradiation, no effect on metastasis or survival was observed. This study demonstrates the importance of the NK cell as a primary effector cell for the control of metastasis from in vivo derived ocular B16F10 melanoma.",Excluded
3294,"Long term radiological features of radiation-induced lung damage Purpose: To describe the radiological findings of radiation-induced lung damage (RILD) present on CT imaging of lung cancer patients 12 months after radical chemoradiation. Material(s) and Method(s): Baseline and 12-month CT scans of 33 patients were reviewed from a phase I/II clinical trial of isotoxic chemoradiation (IDEAL CRT). CT findings were scored in three categories derived from eleven sub-categories: (1) parenchymal change, defined as the presence of consolidation, ground-glass opacities (GGOs), traction bronchiectasis and/or reticulation; (2) lung volume reduction, identified through reduction in lung height and/or distortions in fissures, diaphragm, anterior junction line and major airways anatomy, and (3) pleural changes, either thickening and/or effusion. Result(s): Six patients were excluded from the analysis due to anatomical changes caused by partial lung collapse and abscess. All remaining 27 patients had radiological evidence of lung damage. The three categories, parenchymal change, shrinkage and pleural change were present in 100%, 96% and 82% respectively. All patients had at least two categories of change present and 72% all three. GGOs, reticulation and traction bronchiectasis were present in 44%, 52% and 37% of patients. Conclusion(s): Parenchymal change, lung shrinkage and pleural change are present in a high proportion of patients and are frequently identified in RILD. GGOs, reticulation and traction bronchiectasis are common at 12 months but not diagnostic.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",Excluded
3525,"Stereotactic body radiation therapy for post-pulmonary lobectomy isolated lung metastasis of thoracic tumor: Survival and side effects Background: Stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) has emerged as an alternative treatment for patients with early stage non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) or metastatic pulmonary tumors. However, for isolated lung metastasis (ILM) of thoracic malignances after pulmonary lobectomy, reported outcomes of SBRT have been limited. This study evaluates the role of SBRT in the treatment of such patients. Method(s): A retrospective search of the SBRT database was conducted in three hospitals. The parameters analyzed in the treated patients were local control, progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS), and the treatment-related side-effects. Result(s): In total, 23 patients with single ILM after pulmonary lobectomy treated with SBRT were identified and the median follow-up time was 14 months (range: 6.0-47.0 months). Local recurrences were observed in two patients during follow-up and the 1-year local control rate was 91.3%. Median PFS and OS for the studied cohort were 10.0 months [95% confidence interval (CI) 5.1-14.9 months] and 21.0 months (95% CI 11.4-30.6 months), respectively. Acute radiation pneumonitis (RP) of grade 2 or worse was observed in five (21.7%) and three (13.0%) patients, respectively. Other treatment-related toxicities included chest wall pain in one patient (4.3%) and acute esophagitis in two patients (8.7%). By Pearson correlation analysis, the planning target volume (PTV) volume and the volume of the ipsilateral lung exposed to a minimum dose of 5 Gy (IpV5) were significantly related to the acute RP of grade 2 or worse in present study (p < 0.05). The optimal thresholds of the PTV and IpV5 to predict RP of acute grade 2 or worse RP were 59 cm3 and 51% respectively, according to the receiver-operating characteristics curve analysis, with sensitivity/specificity of 75.0%/80.0% and 62.5%/80.0%. Conclusion(s): SBRT for post-lobectomy ILM was effective and well tolerated. The major reason for disease progression was distant failure but not local recurrence. The PTV and IpV5 are potential predictors of acute RP of grade 2 or higher and should be considered in treatment planning for such patients.Copyright © 2014 Xiong et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",Excluded
543,"In vivo UHMWPE biodegradation of retrieved prosthesis Sixty-two ultra high molecular weight polyethylene prosthetic components (PEs) (31 tibial plateaux and 31 cups), sterilised by gamma rays or ethylene oxide (EtO), were retrieved after 1-12 years depending on different medical reasons and were studied by FTIR spectroscopy with derivatisation of oxidised species. Esters, acids and hydroperoxides were found under the surface of the EtO sterilised PEs up to 2 mm depth. The behaviour of gamma ray sterilised PEs is more complex due to the oxidation following the sterilisation process. Ester and acid formation might arise from the diffusion of components of synovial liquid or from the oxidation process, whereas hydroperoxide formation is thought to be due to the oxidation. Abrasion and delamination process is discussed considering the topological distribution of degradation products.",Excluded
144,"Endoscopic esophageal reconstruction for the treatment of a total and extensive disruption of the esophagus using a ''rendez-vous'' technique INTRODUCTION: Complete esophageal obstruction leads to definitive fasting. The rendez-vous endoscopic approach had already been described for complex stenoses as an alternative to surgery that has high morbid-mortality. AIMS & METHODS: This is a case series report about six patients referred for complete esophageal disruption classified in two groups: 1/ Long disruption (> 5cm), one after caustic ingestion and two due to an esophageal stripping during SEMS removal. Two had an associated loss of the SES; 2/ Short disruption (< 5cm), consecutive to radiation therapy for a neck neoplasia. They had been fasting for 3 to 18 months. All the procedures were performed according the anterograde retrograde approach, under anesthesia and with CO2 insufflation and X-rays guidance. RESULT(S): There were 3 men and women between 25 and 71 years old. All the reconstructions have been successful in one to three endoscopic sessions, using the non hydrophilic tip of a guide wire passed through a straight catheter in 5 cases and a EUS needle in only one case. In 2 cases, a neo-SES had to be created, by transillumination (n=1) or head and neck surgery (n=1). In order to guide the reconstruction, SEMS was used in one case, NGT in one case, and both were used in one patient. The first dilation was performed with a CRE balloon (12-15mm). All the patients could eat mixed after 2 POD. There was no intraoperative or post-operative complication. Then, the patients underwent 3 to 18 dilations sessions during 1.5 to 15 months; two are still undergoing dilations and all eat normally. CONCLUSION(S): Endoscopic rendez-vous for esophageal reconstruction is safe and effective in case of esophageal disruption even with loss of SES, avoiding surgery.",Excluded
710,"Different patterns of allelic imbalance in sporadic tumors and tumors associated with long-term exposure to gamma-radiation The study aimed to reveal cancer related mutations in DNA repair and cell cycle genes associated with chronic occupational exposure to gamma-radiation in personnel of the Siberian Group of Chemical Enterprises (SGCE). Mutations were analyzed by comparing genotypes of malignant tumors and matched normal tissues of 255 cancer patients including 98 exposed to external gamma-radiation (mean dose 128.1 +/- 150.5 mSv). Also a genetic association analysis was carried out in a sample of 149 cancer patients and 908 healthy controls occupationally exposed to gamma-radiation (153.2 +/- 204.6 mSv and 150.5 +/- 211.2 mSv, respectively). Eight SNPs of genes of DNA excision repair were genotyped (rs13181, rs1052133 , rs1042522, rs2305427, rs4244285, rs1045642, rs1805419 and rs1801133). The mutation profiles in heterozygous loci for selected SNP were different between sporadic tumors and tumors in patients exposed to radiation. In sporadic tumors, heterozygous genotype Arg/Pro of the rs1042522 SNP mutated into Arg/0 in 15 cases (9.6%) and 0/Pro in 14 cases (8.9%). The genotype Lys/Gln of the rs13181 SNP mutated into Lys/0 and 0/Gln in 9 and 4 cases, respectively. In tumors of patients exposed to low-level radiation, the rs1042522 Arg/0 mutated genotype was found in 12 cases (12.1%), while in 2 cases (2%) 0/Pro mutation was observed. Finally, the rs13181 0/Gln mutated genotype was observed in 15 cases (16,5%) Thus, our study showed the difference in patterns of allelic imbalance in tumors appeared under low-level radiation exposure and spontaneous tumors for selected SNPs. This suggests different mechanisms of inactivation of heterozygous genotypes in sporadic and radiation-induced tumors.Copyright © 2015 Elsevier B.V.",Included

2255,"Prior exposure to medical and dental x-rays related to tumors of the parotid gland Findings from this population-based study in Los Angeles County suggest, for the first time, that tumors of the parotid gland are related to prior exposure to diagnostic medical and dental radiography. Responses to interviews with 408 patients with a parotid tumor (269 benign tumors and 139 malignant tumors) were compared to responses of 408 neighborhood controls. Cumulative exposure of the parotid gland from diagnostic radiography was associated with a dose-related increase in risk of malignant tumors (P for trend less than .05; relative risk for exposure to greater than or equal to 50 rad = 3.4; 95% confidence interval = 1.02-11.46). Benign tumors showed a weaker positive association, and exposure before age 20 to a major diagnostic examination (full-mouth or panoramic dental radiography or medical radiography to the head) increased risk (relative risk = 1.8; confidence interval = 1.13-2.91). This study also confirmed the association of malignant tumors with prior radiation treatment to the head or neck; 28% of these tumors are attributable to exposure of the parotid gland from diagnostic and therapeutic radiation.",Included
193,"Sex-specific radiation-induced microRNAome responses in the hippocampus, cerebellum and frontal cortex in a mouse model Ionizing radiation is an important treatment modality, but it is also a well-known genotoxic agent capable of damaging cells and tissues. Therefore radiation treatment can cause numerous side effects in exposed tissues and organs. Radiotherapy is a part of the front-line treatment regime for brain cancer patients, but can cause severe functional and morphological changes in exposed brain tissues. However, the mechanisms of radiation-induced effects in the brain are not well understood and are under-investigated. Recent data has implicated short RNAs, especially microRNAs, as important in radiation responses, yet nothing is known about radiation-induced changes in the brain microRNAome. We analyzed the effects of X-ray irradiation on microRNA expression in the hippocampus, frontal cortex, and cerebellum of male and female mice. Here, we report tissue-, time-, and sex-specific brain radiation responses, as well as show evidence of an interplay between microRNAs and their targets. Specifically, we show that changes in the expression of the miR-29 family may be linked, at least in part, to altered expression of de novo methyltransferase DNMT3a and changed global DNA methylation levels. Further, these sex-specific epigenetic changes may be correlated to the prevalence of radiation-induced cancers in males. We identified several microRNAs that can potentially serve as biomarkers of brain radiation exposure. In summary, our study may provide an important roadmap for further analysis of microRNA expression in different brain regions of male and female mice and for detailed dissection of radiation-induced brain responses.",Included

249,"Inter-laboratory consistency and variability in the buccal micronucleus cytome assay depends on biomarker scored and laboratory experience: results from the HUMNxl international inter-laboratory scoring exercise The buccal micronucleus cytome (BMNcyt) assay in uncultured exfoliated epithelial cells from oral mucosa is widely applied in biomonitoring human exposures to genotoxic agents and is also proposed as a suitable test for prescreening and follow-up of precancerous oral lesions. The main limitation of the assay is the large variability observed in the baseline values of micronuclei (MNi) and other nuclear anomalies mainly related to different scoring criteria. The aim of this international collaborative study, involving laboratories with different level of experience, was to evaluate the inter- and intra-laboratory variations in the BMNcyt parameters, using recently implemented guidelines, in scoring cells from the same pooled samples obtained from healthy subjects (control group) and from cancer patients undergoing radiotherapy (treated group). The results indicate that all laboratories correctly discriminated samples from the two groups by a significant increase of micronucleus (MN) and nuclear bud (NBUD) frequencies and differentiated binucleated (BN) cells, associated with the exposure to ionizing radiation. The experience of the laboratories was shown to play an important role in the identification of the different cell types and nuclear anomalies. MN frequency in differentiated mononucleated (MONO) and BN cells showed the greatest consistency among the laboratories and low variability was also detected in the frequencies of MONO and BN cells. A larger variability was observed in classifying the different cell types, indicating the subjectivity in the interpretation of some of the scoring criteria while reproducibility of the results between scoring sessions was very good. An inter-laboratory calibration exercise is strongly recommended before starting studies with BMNcyt assay involving multiple research centers. Copyright © The Author 2016.

Overall, 3D conformal treatment planning resulted in more homogenous dose distribution to target tissues with lower hot spots and dose ranges. Dose homogeneity and guarantee of not under-dosing target tissues with 3D conformal planning came at the cost, however, of delivering greater mean doses of radiation and of irradiating greater volumes of surrounding normal tissue structures.

Method(s): There were 25 patients-22 (88%) men and 3 (12%) women (60+/-13 years) with decompensated CHF recruited for the study. All patients underwent following examinations: medical history, physical examination, laboratory tests (repeated on the lung function tests day), 12-leads electrocardiogram, X-ray, echocardiogram. The spirometry and body plethysmography were performed after patient's clinical haemodynamic stabilization. The following lung function tests parameters were taken into analysis: forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1), Tiffeneau ratio -FEV1 %VCmax (Maximal Vital Capacity), total lung capacity (TLC), vital capacity (VC), total airway resistance (Rtot). All examinations were repeated 3 months after the discharge. The median follow-up was 61 months. The Student's t-test or Mann-Whitney-U test, chi2 test and Pearson correlation were used for the initial statistical analysis. Result(s): The ejection fraction (EF) <=35% (21,1%+/-7,42) was confirmed in all patients on admission and 3 months after the discharge (23,3+/-8%, p=0,05). The elevated BNP level (2131,3+/-1096,8 pg/ml) was revealed in all patients on admission. Both BNP levels after stabilization (1192,4+/-1070,8 pg/ml) and 3 months after the discharge (745,7+/-635pg/ml) were lower than initial (p<0,0001). The spirometry revealed obstructive disorders in 20 patients (80%) at the discharge and 3 months later. The body plethysmography confirmed restrictive disorders in 2 patients (8%) at the discharge. We revealed the significant correlations between FEV1%VCmax and the highest BNP level (r=-0,45, p=0,027 ) and BNP level on lung function tests day (r=-0,44, p=0,03). We also found negative relationships between: EF and FEV1 (r=-0,41, p=0,04), EF and TLC (r=-0,59, p=0,007), EF and FEV1 measured 3 months after the discharge (r=-0,45, p=0,04).

2715,"Dosimetric effect of different isocenter for nasopharyngeal carcinoma with volumetric modulated arc therapy Objective: The purpose of this study was to analyze the dosimetric effect of different isocenters with volumetric modulated arc therapy for nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC). Method(s): A total of 20 NPC patients who had received radiotherapy were re-planned by the volumetric modulated arc therapy plan. Three volumetric modulated arc therapy plans with different isocenters were generated for each patient: the first plan using the center of PGTVnx as the isocenter (AP-V), the second plan using the center of PGTVnd as the isocenter (BP-V), and the third plan using the center of PTV2 as the isocenter (CP-V). The conformity and homogeneity indexes of the target, dose-volume histogram of organs at risk, normal tissue, volume of dose, and monitor units were compared for the three plans. Result(s): AP-V provided a significantly lower maximum dose for the optic nerves and optic chiasm; lower mean dose for the eyeballs; lower absolute volume >10 Gy, absolute volume >20 Gy, and absolute volume >30 Gy; and fewer monitor units than BP-V and CP-V. BP-V and CP-V provided a significantly lower absolute volume >50 Gy than AP-V. In the conformity indexes of PGTVnd and PTV2, BP-V and CP-V were significantly better than in AP-V. In the homogeneity index of PTV2, BP-V and CP-V were significantly better than in AP-V. In general, there is no significant difference between BP-V and CP-V. Conclusion(s): All three plans achieved the clinical demands. AP-V decreased the volumes of absolute volume >10 Gy, absolute volume >20 Gy, and absolute volume >30 Gy, whereas BP-V and CP-V decreased the volume of absolute volume >50 Gy. In terms of organs at risk, AP-V offered better protection of the optic nerves, optic chiasm, and eyeballs for NPC than BP-V and CP-V. Most importantly, AP-V enhanced the utilization of the monitor units. For this reason, we propose that the radiotherapy technician put the location position in the PGTVnx center during simulation of the NPC patients. We further propose that the isocenter be moved to the geometric center of PGTVnx if the NPC patient plan has higher dosimeter requirements for the optic nerves, optic chiasm, or eyeballs.Copyright © 2019 The Authors.

2013,"Narrow-band ultraviolet B radiation induces the expression of beta-endorphin in human skin in vivo BACKGROUND: Ultraviolet radiation (UVR) from the sun and solaria has addictive properties that may develop into dependence. In mice, UVR addiction was connected to beta-endorphin (beta-END) formed in the skin after UVR exposure. In humans, the formation of beta-END in skin keratinocytes has not been confirmed in vivo., OBJECTIVE: To determine with immunohistochemistry if sub-erythematous narrow-band UV-B (NB-UV-B) exposures stimulate p53 mediated expression of pro-opiomelanocortin (POMC), beta-END and alpha-melanocyte stimulating hormone (alpha-MSH) in human skin keratinocytes in vivo., METHODS: Within 12 healthy volunteers, 7 received a single 1 standard erythema dose (SED) of NB-UV-B on their whole body, and 5 volunteers received a cumulative dose of 3 SED delivered on two subsequent days i.e., 1+2 SED. Skin biopsies were taken immediately before the first exposure and at 24h from the last UV-B exposure to assess p53, beta-END, POMC, and alpha-MSH expression., RESULTS: Nuclear p53 expression increased in all samples taken at 24h after NB-UV-B exposure. UV-B irradiation also increased epidermal beta-END expression in 11 out of 12 samples taken at 24h after UV-B exposure. The brownish staining was localized in the cytoplasm of keratinocytes and around the nuclei, being more pronounced in the basal cell layers. POMC and alpha-MSH staining showed no obvious meaningful increase since only one section of each showed any change compared with basal levels., CONCLUSIONS: Our study is the first to show that UV-B exposures increase beta-END expression in epidermal keratinocytes of human skin in vivo, which could be the link to proposed UVR addiction.

1119,"Optimization physicals parameters for cardiac perfusion imaging Objective myocardial perfusion imaging (MPI) has become an important tool and a substantial for diagnosis and management of heart disease. A new iterative reconstruction algorithm (flash 3D) has been recently proposed for (SPECT). The aim of work was to evaluate radiation exposure to practitioners and patients by reliance on reconstructions methods that aid in reducing the injected dose Methods: Forty-eight patients (30 M, 18F) who were referred to our department forMPI were randomly selected and divided into 3 groups: Group (1): contained two sub-groups, one scanned with full administrated dose (25+/-3.2 mCi) and half dose (10 +/-2.5mci) Group (2): contained two sub-groups, one scanned with 32 projections per scan, the other with 16 projections per scan. Group (3): contained two sub-groups, one scanned at a time per projection of 20 s and the other scanned at 10 s per projection. The three groups were processed using 3D reconstruction algorithm(flash 3 D) (4 subsets, 13 iterations, FWHM=14 mm). Dose rate was recorded using a calibrated standard survey meter for all patients after dose administration. Besides, Dose calculations were also considered the time elapsed during staff exposure that included dose prepration, injection, patient imaging, and release times. Myocardial functional parameters such as Ejection Fraction (EF), End Diastole Volume (EDV), End Systole Volume (ESV) and Total Perfusion Defect (TPD) were compared for each group. Result(s): Qualitative assessments results from all groups showed which include (full dose (25+/-3.2mci) and half dose (10+/-2.5mci), one scanned with 32 projections per scan, the other with 16 projections per scan and a time per projection of 20 s and the other scanned at 10 s per projection Images were visually scored as very-good quality and sufficiently convergent and identical. Quantitative results using ( 3D) showed insignificant difference of the EF, EDV, ESV and TPD between the different groups. Dose rate reduced by 48%. when reducing to half dose (dose rate was 33+/-4.5 reduced to 14.8+/-3.6 along one meter from patient, also dose rate was reduced from 120+/-5.6 muSv/h to 67 +/-3.9.6 muSv/h in patients' rest room) for that reason the effective dose 15.2 +/- 2.4 was reduced to 7.1 +/- 1.8 when using half protocols with 3D . Conclusion(s): New 3D enable reduction of dose administration or total acquisition time plays a significant role in staff exposure. Further investigations can be performed to assess these results on large patients cohort with further dose reduction.",Excluded
2605,"Response of the rat spinal cord to X-ray microbeams BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: To quantify the late dose-related responses of the rat cervical spinal cord to X-ray irradiations by an array of microbeams or by a single millimeter beam., MATERIALS AND METHODS: Necks of anesthetized rats were irradiated transversely by an 11 mm wide array of 52 parallel, 35 mum wide, vertical X-ray microbeams, separated by 210 mum intervals between centers. Comparison was made with rats irradiated with a 1.35 mm wide single beam of similar X-rays. Rats were killed when paresis developed, or up to 383 days post irradiation (dpi)., RESULTS: Microbeam peak/valley doses of =357/12.7 Gy to 715/25.4 Gy to an 11 mm long segment of the spinal cord, or single beam doses of =146-454 Gy to a 1.35 mm long segment caused foreleg paresis and histopathologically verified spinal cord damage; rats exposed to peak/valley doses up to 253/9 Gy were paresis-free at 383 dpi., CONCLUSIONS: Whereas microbeam radiation therapy [MRT] for malignant gliomas implanted in rat brains can be safe, palliative or curative, the high tolerance of normal rat spinal cords to similar microbeam exposures justifies testing MRT for autochthonous malignancies in the central nervous system of larger animals with a view to subsequent clinical applications.

Material(s) and Method(s): Fifty-seven elderly patients with postoperative local recurrence of rectal carcinoma were randomly divided into a clinical group and a control group. The clinical group had 31 patients, who received 6 Mv X-ray 3DCRT, 2 Gy per time, 5 times every week. After radiotherapy for the total pelvis until target dose (DT) in tumor focus reached 40 Gy/20f, the tumor focus was intensified up to DT 60-64 Gy with 8 Mv X-ray DT 20-24 Gy. During radiotherapy, the patients were treated with XELOX (oxaliplatin 85 mg/m2, dl, Xeloda 850 mg/m2, p.o. d1-14) for two periods. The control group had 26 pa tients, who were only treated with XELOX. Result(s): The responder rate (RR) of the clinical group was 87.1%. The survival rates within 1, 2 and 3 years were 67.7%, 51.6% and 41.9% respectively, which were higher than the control group (p < 0.05). However, the clinical group had significantly more 1st and 2nd degree myelosuppression and hand-foot syndrome. The symptoms were relieved after symptomatic treatment.

2571,"Which patients are prone to undergo disproportionate recurrent CT imaging and should we worry? Purpose: To identify the spectrum of patients who undergo disproportionate recurrent computed tomography (CT) imaging, and to explore the cumulative effects of radiation exposure and intravenously injected contrast agents in these patients. Method(s): This retrospective study investigated all patients who had undergone 40 or more CT scans at a tertiary care center between 2007-2017. Result(s): Fifty-six patients who had undergone a median of 47 (range: 40-92) CT scans were included. The main reason for CT scanning in all patients was oncological, and 55 patients (98.2 %) had metastatic disease. Twenty-six patients (45.6) had received chemotherapy, 35 (62.5 %) radiation therapy, 38 (67.9 %) targeted therapy, 12 (21.4 %) liver tumor microwave ablation, 44 (78.6 %) major surgery, and 34 (60.7 %) had participated in a therapeutic trial. Mean cumulative effective dose was 187.4 mSv (range: 120.7-278.4 mSv). Median estimated radiation-induced lifetime attributable risk (LAR) of cancer incidence was 1.0 % (range: 0.20-2.36 %). Mean estimated radiation-induced LAR of cancer mortality was 0.68 % (range: 0.18-1.37 %). Mean cumulative volume of intravenously injected iomeprol was 2339 mL (range: 540-3605 mL). Three patients (5.4 %) had developed severely decreased kidney function (estimated glomerular filtration rate between 15 and 29 mL/min per 1.73 m2 for at least 3 months). Conclusion(s): Patients with metastatic disease who experience a relatively long survival may be prone to undergo disproportionate recurrent CT imaging. The non-negligible CT radiation-induced cancer risk and mortality should be taken into account in these patients, while the effect of cumulatively administered CT contrast agents on kidney function requires further investigation.Copyright © 2020 The Author(s)",Excluded
174,"Profiles of non-cancer diseases in atomic bomb survivors This article summarizes the results of a recent study of atomic bomb radiation and non-cancer diseases in the AHS (Adult Health Study) population by the RERF (Radiation Effects Research Foundation) along with a general discussion of previous studies. The association of atomic bomb radiation and CVD was examined by incidence studies and prevalence studies of various endpoints of atherosclerosis, such as MI, stroke, aortic arch calcification, isolated systolic hypertension, and pulse wave velocity, and, although the excess was small, all endpoints indicated an increase of CVD in the heavily exposed group. Because of the consistency of the results, it is almost certain that CVD is higher among atomic bomb survivors. However, all CVD risk factors associated with lifestyle had not necessarily been adjusted for in studies to date, and it is difficult at present to conclude that the increase in CVD among survivors was a direct effect of radiation. Recent studies have demonstrated almost certainly that uterine myoma is more frequent among atomic bomb survivors. It cannot, at present, be concluded that uterine myoma is caused by radiation, because there are no reported studies of other exposed populations. Further analyses including the role of confounding factors as well as molecular approaches are needed to verify this radiation effect. The relationship between atomic bomb radiation exposure and hyperparathyroidism can now be said to have been established in view of the strong dose response, the agreement with results of studies of other populations, the high risk in the younger survivors, and the biological plausibility. Future studies by molecular approaches, etc., are needed to determine the pathogenic mechanism. Among other benign tumours, a dose response has been demonstrated for tumours of the thyroid, stomach and ovary. Although fewer studies have been conducted than for cancer, a clear association between radiation and various benign tumours is emerging. Concerning the association between atomic bomb radiation exposure and chronic liver diseases, the recent incidence study of members of the AHS population demonstrated a significant dose response. Both chronic hepatitis and cirrhosis were suggested as being associated with exposure. The possibility that the increased occurrence of chronic liver diseases among the survivors may be due to hepatitis virus infection cannot be excluded, and the results of the ongoing hepatitis C virus antibody titre studies are awaited.",Excluded
2579,"Polymorphisms in DNA repair genes: Link with biomarkers of the CBMN cytome assay in hospital workers chronically exposed to low doses of ionising radiation Individual sensitivity to ionising radiation (IR) is the result of interaction between exposure, DNA damage, and its repair, which is why polymorphisms in DNA repair genes could play an important role. We examined the association between DNA damage, expressed as micronuclei (MNi), nuclear buds (NBs), and nucleoplasmic bridges (NPBs) and single nucleotide polymorphisms in selected DNA repair genes (APE1, hOGG1, XRCC1, XRCC3, XPD, PARP1, MGMT genes; representative of the different DNA repair pathways operating in mammals) in 77 hospital workers chronically exposed to low doses of IR, and 70 matched controls. A significantly higher MNi frequency was found in the exposed group (16.2+/-10.4 vs. 11.5+/-9.4; P=0.003) and the effect appeared to be independent from the principal confounding factor. Exposed individuals with hOGG1, XRCC1, PARP1, and MGMT wild-type alleles or APEX1, as well as XPD (rs13181) heterozygous showed a significantly higher MNi frequency than controls with the same genotypes.

2723,"Occupational ionising radiation and risk of basal cell carcinoma in US radiologic technologists (1983-2005) Objective To determine risk for incident basal cell carcinoma from cumulative low-dose ionising radiation in the US radiologic technologist cohort. Methods We analysed 65 719 Caucasian technologists who were cancer-free at baseline (1983-1989 or 1994-1998) and answered a follow-up questionnaire (2003-2005). Absorbed radiation dose to the skin in mGy for estimated cumulative occupational radiation exposure was reconstructed for each technologist based on badge dose measurements, questionnaire-derived work history and protection practices, and literature information. Radiation-Associated risk was assessed using Poisson regression and included adjustment for several demographic, lifestyle, host and sun exposure factors. Results Cumulative mean absorbed skin dose (to head/ neck/arms) was 55.8 mGy (range 0-1735 mGy). For lifetime cumulative dose, we did not observe an excess radiation-related risk (excess relative risk/Gy=-0.01 (95% CI -0.43 to 0.52). However, we observed that basal cell carcinoma risk was increased for radiation dose received before age 30 (excess relative risk/ Gy=0.59, 95% CI -0.11 to 1.42) and before 1960 (excess relative risk/Gy=2.92, 95% CI 1.39 to 4.45). Conclusions Basal cell carcinoma risk was unrelated to low-dose radiation exposure among radiologic technologists. Because of uncertainties in dosimetry and sensitivity to model specifications, both our null results and our findings of excess risk for dose received before age 30 and exposure before 1960 should be interpreted with caution.",Included

AJRs with jaundice on the skin at about 7 days of age were intraperitoneally administered 1 ml/rat of normal rat serum every few days and irradiated with visible light for 14 hours a day in an irradiation box. This treatment allowed us to obtain mature AJRs. The treatment was effective when applied for short periods of 1-4 weeks of age. The frequency of maturation of the treated AJRs was about 27% and the best mating combination was a female ACJ and male AJR.

2919,"Evaluation of non ionizing radiation around the dielectric heaters and sealers: A case report Dielectric heaters and sealers present the most common source of occupational exposure to excessive radio frequency (RF) fields. These systems are used industrially to heat or melt dielectric materials. Nowadays, the effects of high frequency electromagnetic (EM) fields on the health have been discussed frequently but there are few health studies done for workers around dielectric heaters and sealers. In this study, the leakage fields around dielectric heaters and sealers (27.12MHz) were measured in MKE Mechanical and Chemical Industry Corporation, Gazi Rocket Factory and evaluated in terms of standards. It has been observed that operators exposed to same RF fields with occupational exposure limits. Many workers have health complaints, such as elevated body temperatures in the factory. Safe distances or areas for workers should be recommended in these systems. Protective measures could be implemented to minimize these exposures. Further measurements and occupational exposure studies of RF exposed women and men are needed to demonstrate the levels of exposed Radio Frequency Radiation (RFR). Precautions should therefore be taken either to reduce the leakage fields or minimise the exposed fields. 2010 Informa Healthcare USA, Inc.",Excluded
2331,"Relative dose and vascular response after drug-eluting stent implantation: A dosimetric 3D-intravascular ultrasound study Background In drug-eluting stents (DESs), the theoretical drug dose exposed to the vessel wall per stent surface area may vary due to the fixed loading dose and differences in the stent surface area once expanded in varying vessel sizes. The aim of this study was to evaluate the potential effects of different dose intensities, as estimated by 3D-IVUS dosimetry, on vascular response after DES implantation. Methods Follow-up (6-9 months) 3D-IVUS was performed in 840 coronary lesions treated with a single DES of the following types: sirolimus (SES, n = 148), paclitaxel (PES, n = 162), Endeavor zotarolimus (E-ZES, n = 233), Resolute zotarolimus (R-ZES, n = 147), and everolimus (EES, n = 150). Volume index (volume/length, mm3/mm) was obtained for vessel, lumen, plaque, stent, and neointima. In each lesion, exposed dose intensity was calculated as known loading dose divided by measured luminal surface area of the stented segment. Lesions were divided into tertiles based on the exposed dose intensity: high, medium, and low dose groups. Results The exposed dose intensity ranged 0.74-1.76 mug/mm2 for SES, 0.41-1.18 mug/mm2 for PES, 0.71-1.57 mug/mm2 for E-ZES, 0.72-1.63 mug/mm2 for R-ZES, and 0.40-0.99 mug/mm2 for EES. All types of DES showed no significant difference in neointimal hyperplasia among the 3 groups, except that E-ZES showed significantly less neointimal hyperplasia in the high dose group. Conclusions Detailed 3D-IVUS revealed significant lesion-to-lesion variability in dose intensity exposed to the vessel wall following DES implantation. However, the major types of DES appear to yield equally effective neointimal suppression, despite the varying dose intensity, except for E-ZES.Copyright © 2015 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

However, few knowledge about their role in the occurrence of wound healing disorders (WHD) following radiation therapy (RT) exists. This study aims to evaluate the expression profiles of specific molecular pathway marker genes. Method(s): Expression profiles of the genes encoding MAPK, NOS1, NOS3, and PIK3CA were analyzed, by RT-PCR, in specimens from patients with and without a history of RT to the head and neck. Clinical data on the occurrence of cervical WHDs were analyzed. Result(s): Expression analysis of patients with postoperative WHDs revealed a significant increase in MAPK expression compared to the control group without occurrence of postoperative WHDs. PIK3CA showed a significantly increased expression in patients with a history of RT. Expression analysis of all other investigated genes did not reveal significant differences. Conclusion(s): This current study is able to show the influence of RT on different molecular pathways. This underlines the crucial role of specific molecular networks, responsible for the occurrence of long-term radiation toxicity such as WHDs.

Reviewed were 77 treated kidney cancers metastases in the lungs of 44 patients in this prospective study. Materials/Methods: Seventy-seven renal cell carcinoma (RCC) lung metastases in 44 patients underwent HFSR. All the patients were evaluated prospectively before and after treatment. Age at treatment ranged from 42 to 85 years (mean 65.9) with 11 females and 33 males. Fifty-five percent of patients had prior chemotherapy, 86% had prior surgery to the primary site, and 9% had prior surgery to the lung. Tumor volumes ranged from 0.06 to 3166 cc (mean 119.5). Patients were treated with 400-900 cGy per fraction (median 800) in 3-8 fractions (median 5) for a total dose of 2000-4500 cGy (median 4000). Cancers were radiographically evaluated with contrast CT and/or MRI studies and reviewed independently by radiologists. Control of the treated cancer is defined as cessation of growth, shrinkage, or disappearance of the cancer after treatment. Result(s): Follow up ranged from 1 to 59 months (mean 12) with an overall control rate of 97%. Two of the 77 lung metastases did not respond to radiosurgery. By dose, volume, age, sex, and prior treatment, there was no statistically significant difference in outcome. Conclusion(s): Radiosurgery for metastatic RCC to the lung offers a generally well-tolerated, noninvasive treatment method with a high rate of tumor control.

Wide-field external beam radiation therapy, which we define as irradiation of cranial or caudal halves of the body either individually or sequentially, was undertaken as an experimental option to treat cats with either chemotherapy-refractory or naive hematopoietic neoplasia considered to have a poor prognosis. Fifteen cats with hematopoietic malignancies received wide-field external beam radiation therapy between 2003 and 2006. Cats received 8Gy delivered in 4Gy fractions with 60Co photons. Treatment-related toxicity was scored according to criteria established by the Veterinary Cooperative Oncology Group. Animals without preexisting abnormalities on hemograms exhibited no or mild (Grade 1 or 2) hematopoietic toxicity. Although most cats (14 of 15) had preexisting gastrointestinal (GI) signs, these signs were stable (29%) or improved (42%) following irradiation. Worsening GI signs following irradiation occurred transiently in two cats and in association with progressive disease in two others. No pulmonary, renal, hepatic, or dermatologic toxicities were detected.

The aim of this retrospective, explorative analysis was to define the role of recent treatment strategies and to examine the value of different prognostic factors., PATIENTS AND METHODS: A total of 110 patients was analyzed. Complete resection, partial resection, and biopsy was accomplished in 69, 22, and 19 patients, respectively. 56 patients received conventionally fractionated radiotherapy with a median total dose of 60 Gy, 2 Gy daily. 54 patients received hyperfractionated accelerated radiotherapy with a median total dose of 54 Gy, 2 x 1.8 Gy daily. 20 patients had concomitant temozolomide (50-75 mg/m2/d), and 20 patients concomitant topotecan (0.5 mg/m2 as continuous venous infusion over 21 days). 37 patients received temozolomide as salvage therapy., RESULTS: Median overall (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS) were 8.7 and 4.8 months. After complete resection, partial resection, and biopsy, OS was 9.5, 8.5, and 5.5 months, respectively. OS was 8.5, 13.8, and 8.2 months for radiotherapy alone, concomitant temozolomide, and concomitant topotecan, respectively. Hazard ratio was 0.29 (OS; p = 0.002) and 0.32 (DFS; p = 0.003) for concomitant temozolomide compared to radiotherapy alone. Topotecan led to an increased toxicity. With 9.7 months for conventionally fractionated radiotherapy and 8.1 months for hyperfractionated radiotherapy, OS differed significantly (p = 0.003, log-rank test). OS in patients with RPA (recursive partitioning analysis) score III, IV, V, and VI was 14.1, 10, 9.5, and 5.8 months (p = 0.003, log-rank test). In the univariate (p = 0.0001, log-rank test) and multivariate analysis (p = 0.002, Cox regression), salvage temozolomide led to a statistically significant survival benefit (10.6 vs. 7.7 months)., CONCLUSION: Concomitant topotecan or the use of hyperfractionated radiotherapy did not show to be superior in outcome in this retrospective analysis. Topotecan led to an increased toxicity. An attempt at complete resection is justified. Temozolomide should be integrated in therapy initially.

873,"Experiences of xerostomia after radiotherapy in patients with head and neck cancer: A qualitative study AIMS AND OBJECTIVES: To describe the experiences of radiation-induced xerostomia in patients with head and neck cancer., BACKGROUND: Xerostomia is the most commonly occurring complication during and following radiotherapy. It can persist for several months or years and can have a significant impact on patients' quality of life., DESIGN: This was a qualitative descriptive study., METHODS: Semi-structured interviews were conducted with a sample of 20 participants. Inductive content analysis was used to analyse the qualitative data., RESULTS: Analysis of the manifest content identified five categories: communication problems, physical problems, psychosocial problems, treatment problems and relief strategies. The latent content was formulated into a theme: due to lack of information from professionals, the patients had to find their own solutions for their problems., CONCLUSIONS: Xerostomia is not only a biophysical symptom but also has a profound effect on the emotional, intellectual and sociocultural dimensions of life. The majority of patients continued to suffer from xerostomia and its associated symptoms after radiotherapy, in part, because of a lack of professional support, including the inability of nurses to provide oral health care., RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE: Nurses need to be knowledgeable about the effects of radiotherapy on oral mucosa and about appropriate interventions.

1795,"Effects of NKG2D haplotypes on the cell-surface expression of NKG2D protein on natural killer and CD8 T cells of peripheral blood among atomic-bomb survivors NKG2D is a primary activating receptor that triggers cell-mediated cytotoxicity in NK cells against tumor and virus-infected cells. We previously identified the NKG2D haplotypes in the natural killer gene complex region on chromosome 12p. Two major haplotype alleles, LNK1 and HNK1, were closely related to low and high natural cytotoxic activity phenotypes, respectively. Furthermore, the haplotype of HNK1/HNK1 has revealed a decreased risk of cancer compared with LNK1/LNK1. In the present study, using flow cytometry, we evaluated the functional effects of NKG2D haplotypes and five htSNPs in terms of the cell-surface expression of NKG2D protein on NK and CD8 T cells of peripheral blood among 732 atomic-bomb survivors. NKG2D expression on NK cells showed significant increases, in the order of LNK1/LNK1, LNK1/HNK1 and HNK1/HNK1 haplotypes (p for trend = 0.003), or with major homozygous, heterozygous, and minor homozygous genotypes for individual htSNPs (p for trend = 0.02-0.003). The same trend was observed for NKG2D expression on CD8 T cells. Our findings indicate that the NKG2D haplotypes are associated with the expression levels of NKG2D protein on NK and CD8 T cells, resulting in inter-individual variations in human cytotoxic response. © 2012 American Society for Histocompatibility and Immunogenetics.",Included
3126,"Ultra-low-dose computed tomography and its utility in wrist trauma in the emergency department Background: The use and frequency of computed tomography (CT) are increasing day by day in emergency departments (ED). This increases the amount of radiation exposed. Purpose(s): To evaluate the image quality obtained by ultra-low-dose CT (ULDCT) in patients with suspected wrist fractures in the ED and to investigate whether it is an alternative to standard-dose CT (SDCT). Material(s) and Method(s): This is a study prospectively examining 336 patients who consulted the ED for wrist trauma. After exclusion criteria were applied, the patients were divided into the study and control groups. Then, SDCT (120 kVp and 100 mAs) and ULDCT (80 kVp and 5 mAs) wrist protocols were applied simultaneously. The images obtained were evaluated for image quality and fracture independently by a radiologist and an emergency medical specialist using a 5-point scale. Result(s): The effective radiation dose calculated for the control group scans was 41.1 +/- 2.1 microSv, whereas the effective radiation dose calculated for the study group scans was 0.5 +/- 0.0 microSv. The effective radiation dose of the study group was significantly lower than that of the control group (P < 0.01). The CT images in the study group showed no significant differences in the mean image quality score between observer 1 and observer 2 (3.4 and 4.3, respectively; P = 0.58). Both observers could detect all fractures using the ULDCT images. Conclusion(s): ULDCT provides high-quality images in wrist traumas while reducing the radiation dose by approximately 98% compared to SDCT without any changes in diagnostic accuracy.Copyright © The Foundation Acta Radiologica 2021.",Excluded

Forty had imaging evidence of temporal lobe injury (TLI-positive), and 20 did not (TLI-negative). The patients and 19 healthy control subjects, matched with the patients for age and educational level, underwent extensive memory assessments. Seventeen patients (10 TLI-positive, 7 TLI-negative) were reassessed after an average of 28 months for progress of memory functions. The patient groups performed significantly worse on most memory tests compared with the normal subjects. Patients with memory complaints had lower scores for verbal memory than those without such complaints. The TLI-positive and TLI-negative groups did not differ significantly from each other in cognitive performance. At follow-up, visual memory performance had deteriorated, while verbal memory remained more stable.",Included
1668,"Expandable metallic stent placement for malignant venous stenosis The expandable metallic stent (EMS) is used to dilate narrowed vascular or ductal lumina. We used EMS in patients with venous stenosis caused by maligant tumor. EMS were applied in 8 patients. The venogram demonstrated stenosis of vein, and the stenotic ratio were ranged 67-100%. After stent placement, all patients obtained symptomatic relief, and the stenotic ratio improved 20-60% in 7 patients. In one patient, EMS did not expand, but symptom relieved 4 days after stent placement, and following X-ray film showed expansion of EMS. One patient had recurrence of symptom 10 days after stent placement due to dislodgement of EMS. Additional EMS was placed, and symptom improved again. All 8 patients did not suffer recurrence of symptom from 3 weeks to 18 months. We conclude that EMS appears to be useful in patients with venous stenosis caused by malignant tumor.",Excluded
2357,"Multidrug resistance determinants in acute myeloid leukemia developed in persons exposed to ionizing radiation due to the Chernobyl accident The results of multidrug resistance determinants expression analysis on leukemic cells of 56 acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients by immunophenotyping are presented. Of these, there were 21 persons exposed to ionizing radiation due to the Chemobyl accident with radiation-associated AML and 35 patients with spontaneous leukemia. The aim of this study was to determine if transport proteins (P-glycoprotein, LRP, and MDR1), apoptosis-related proteins (Fas, Bcl-2, Bax, p53, and Bcl-X(L)), and topoisomerase IIalpha expression in AML patients with the history of radiation exposure differed from those in spontaneous AML cases. Leukemic cells in patients with radiation-associated diseases compared to spontaneous AML more often overexpressed antiapoptotic oncoprotein Bcl-2 (12/21 vs. 6/35, p < 0.005) and less often demonstrated expression of Fas receptor (12/21 vs. 30/35, p < 0.05). Moreover, leukemic cells were simultaneously Fas negative and Bcl-2 positive in 4 out of 21 patients exposed to ionizing radiation but none of spontaneous cases had similar phenotype (p < 0.05). Leukemic cells in patients with radiation-associated AML compared to spontaneous cases more often were P-glycoprotein positive (12/20 vs 9/31, p < 0.05). P-glycoprotein overexpression significantly correlated with resistant disease in patients with radiation-associated AML (r = 0.47, p < 0.05), but was not a prognostic variable for the treatment outcome in terms of overall survival. Defects in pathways of drug-induced apoptosis and function of pump, that actively effluxes drugs could contribute significantly to developing drug resistance in radiation-associated AML.",Included
2028,"Salvage gamma knife stereotactic radiosurgery followed by bevacizumab for recurrent glioblastoma multiforme: a case-control study We evaluated the efficacy and safety of gamma knife stereotactic radiosurgery (GKSR) followed by bevacizumab combined with chemotherapy in 11 patients with recurrent glioblastoma multiforme who experienced tumor progression despite aggressive initial multi-modality treatment. Our experience included eight male and three female patients. The median patient age at GKSR was 62 years (range 46-72 years). At the time of GKSR, seven patients had a first recurrence and four had two or more recurrences. The median interval from the initial diagnosis until GKSR was 17 months (range 5-34.5 months). The median tumor volume was 13.6 cm(3) (range 1.2-45.1 cm(3)) and the median margin dose of GKSR was 16 Gy (range 13-18 Gy). Following GKSR, bevacizumab was administrated with irinotecan in nine patients and with temozolomide in one patient. One patient was treated with bevacizumab monotherapy. The treatment outcomes were compared to 44 case-matched controls who underwent GKSR without additional bevacizumab. At a median of 13.7 months (range 4.6-28.3 months) after radiosurgery, tumor progression was evident in seven patients. The median progression-free survival (PFS) was 15 months (95% confidential interval (CI), 6.5-23.3 months). Six-month and 1-year PFS rates were 73 and 55%, respectively. The median overall survival (OS) from GKSR was 18 months (95% CI, 10.1-25.7 months) and 1-year OS rate was 73%. One patient (9%) experienced grade III toxicity and one patient (9%) had major adverse radiation effects. Compared with patients who did not receive bevacizumab, the patients who received bevacizumab had significantly prolonged PFS (15 months vs. 7 months, P = 0.035) and OS (18 months vs. 12 months, P = 0.005), and were less likely to develop an adverse radiation effect (9 vs. 46%, P = 0.037). The combination of salvage GKSR followed by bevacizumab added potential benefit and little additional risk in a small group of patients with progressive glioblastoma.

2445,"CT urography for the diagnosis of medullary sponge kidney Background: Medullary sponge kidney (MSK) is characterized by malformation of the terminal collecting ducts and is associated with an increased risk of nephrolithiasis, nephrocalcinosis, urinary tract infections, renal acidification defects, and reduced bone density. It has been historically diagnosed with intravenous pyelography (IVP), which is falling out of favor as an imaging modality. CT urography (CTU) performed with multidetector CT (MDCT) has been shown to create images of the renal collecting system with similar detail as IVP; however, its utility in diagnosing MSK has not been defined. Case Report: We present the first 15 patients with recurrent symptomatic nephrolithiasis who were evaluated in our renal stone clinic with CTU. Four patients were diagnosed with MSK after visualization of the characteristic radiologic findings. Discussion(s): CTU effectively demonstrates the characteristic radiologic findings of MSK including collecting tubule dilatation, medullary nephrocalcinosis, nephrolithiasis, and medullary cysts. Dose reduction protocols can reduce radiation exposure below that associated with conventional IVP. We propose CTU be considered for the diagnosis of MSK. © 2014 S. Karger AG, Basel.",Excluded
2772,"Dose-response relationships for radiation-induced hyperparathyroidism It has been hard to establish with certainty that radiation exposure is a risk factor for developing hyperparathyroidism. In part this is because many cases of hyperparathyroidism remain asymptomatic and escape clinical detection. We present results from a study of 2555 subjects who received external beam radiotherapy to the head and neck area for benign conditions before their 16th birthday between 1939 and 1962. The average length of follow-up was 36.6 yr. There were 36 confirmed cases of hyperparathyroidism. Based on a relative risk model, the excess relative risk increased significantly by 0.11/centigray; however, the confidence interval was wide (95% confidence interval, 0.0-17.2). The hyperparathyroidism rates and dose-response relationships were not affected by gender or age at first radiation treatment. The demonstration of a dose-response relationship within an irradiated cohort supports an association between radiation exposure and hyperparathyroidism and suggests that the calcium levels of individuals irradiated to the head and neck area should be monitored.",Excluded
1485,"Clinical features and prognostic factors in patients with bone metastases from hepatocellular carcinoma after liver transplantation BACKGROUND: Little is known about the clinical features and prognostic factors of bone metastases of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) following liver transplantation (LT)., METHODS: All adult patients undergoing LT from 2001 to 2010 were reviewed. Patients with HCC bone metastases after LT received external beam radiotherapy(EBRT) during this period. Demographic variables, laboratory values, and tumor characteristics were determined before LT and EBRT. Total radiation dose ranged from 8 to 60 Gy(median dose 40.0 Gy)., RESULTS: The trunk was the most common site of bone metastases with finding of expansile soft-tissue masses in 23.3% of patients. Overall pain relief from EBRT occurred in 96.7% (29/30). No consistent dose-response relationship was found for palliation of with doses between 30 and 56 Gy (P = 0.670). The median survivals from the time of bone metastases was 8.6 months. On univariate and multivariate analyses, better survival was significantly associated with a better Karnofsky performance status (KPS) and well-controlled intrahepatic tumor, but not with lower alpha-fetoprotein levels. The median time from LT to bone metastases was 7.1 months. Patients exceeding the Shanghai criteria presented with bone metastases earlier than those within the Fudan criteria. Patients with soft-tissue extension always had later bone metastases. The majority of deaths were caused by liver failure due to hepatic decompensation or tumor progression., CONCLUSION: The prognostic factors of bone metastases of HCC following LT are KPS and well-controlled intrahepatic. Even though survival is shorter for these patients, EBRT provides effective palliation of pain.",Excluded

Median dose of 82 gray (80-86gy) was planned on retrogasserian target close to pars triangularis using single isocenter multiarc non-coplanar beams on a Monte-Carlo optimizer. Treatment was delivered using 5mm stereotactic cones with FFF beams at dose rate of 1200mu/mt, 3-D CBCT image guidance, intrafraction imaging and 6-DOF couch. All patients underwent serial MR imaging at time points 72 hrs, 1 week, 1 mo, 3 mo, 6 mo, & 12 mo post SRS. Targeting accuracy was assessed from deviation of the coordinates of the intended target compared with the center of enhancement on 1 month post-SRS MRI. Radiation dose delivered at the borders of contrast enhancement was evaluated. ""Favorable"" responders were patients rendered free of pain, either with or without medications. Complications were defined as lasting neurologic deficits attributable to treatment, and included anesthesia, paresthesia or dysesthesia. Result(s): At median follow-up of 14 mo. pain relief was complete in 13 patients with BNI class 1 response (no medication) and 2 patients BNI had class 2 response (occasional pain not requiring medication). The actuarial rate of obtaining complete pain relief was 93.3%. Imaging changes were same in all the patients post radiosurgery. Nerve edema is seen at 72 hrs post treatment, minimal brainstem edema (nearby DREZ) is noted at 7 days post treatment. Focal enhancement corresponding to SRS shot is seen at 1 month. The enhancement persisted through 6mon. scan but the brainstem edema decreased to pretreatment levels. At 12mo. MR the enhancement faded in intensity. The median deviation of the coordinates between the intended target and the center of contrast enhancement was 0.5 mm (0.3-0.7mm) in Euclidean space. The median radiation doses fitting within the borders of the contrast enhancement of the shot ranged from 78gy. Conclusion(s): Warping original treatment doses on the 1 month post SRS postcontrast MRI gives the clinical team an idea about the accuracy of the treatment and accordingly the errors in treatment. This is the first study reported in literature where serial MR imaging was done post trigeminal radiosurgery.Copyright © 2019",Excluded

3642,"Knee medial and lateral contact forces in a musculoskeletal model with subject-specific contact point trajectories Contact point (CP) trajectory is a crucial parameter in estimating medial/lateral tibio-femoral contact forces from the musculoskeletal (MSK) models. The objective of the present study was to develop a method to incorporate the subject-specific CP trajectories into the MSK model. Ten healthy subjects performed 45 s treadmill gait trials. The subject-specific CP trajectories were constructed on the tibia and femur as a function of extension-flexion using low-dose bi-plane X-ray images during a quasi-static squat. At each extension-flexion position, the tibia and femur CPs were superimposed in the three directions on the medial side, and in the anterior-posterior and proximal-distal directions on the lateral side to form the five kinematic constraints of the knee joint. The Lagrange multipliers associated to these constraints directly yielded the medial/lateral contact forces. The results from the personalized CP trajectory model were compared against the linear CP trajectory and sphere-on-plane CP trajectory models which were adapted from the commonly used MSK models. Changing the CP trajectory had a remarkable impact on the knee kinematics and changed the medial and lateral contact forces by 1.03 BW and 0.65 BW respectively, in certain subjects. The direction and magnitude of the medial/lateral contact force were highly variable among the subjects and the medial-lateral shift of the CPs alone could not determine the increase/decrease pattern of the contact forces. The suggested kinematic constraints are adaptable to the CP trajectories derived from a variety of joint models and those experimentally measured from the 3D imaging techniques.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Ltd",Excluded
172,"Postoperative irradiation for pterygium: retrospective analysis of 1,253 patients from the Osaka University Hospital BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Irradiation of ocular pterygium is considered a valuable treatment supplementation after surgical therapy. Since prospective randomized trials are scare and only limited patient data are available, the aim of this study was to evaluate the patient population treated with fractioned 90Sr irradiation after surgical pterygium resection., PATIENTS AND METHODS: Between September 1993 and March 2001, 1,147 patients with pterygium lesions (1,320 lesions) were treated surgically and with 90Sr postoperative beta-irradiation. A total dose of 30 Gy was used for patients treated within 48 h after surgery, while those treated>48 h postoperatively received a total dose of 35 Gy. A minimum follow-up period of 3 months was required for inclusion in the analysis, and 1,253 lesions were ultimately analyzed., RESULTS: Recurrence of the pterygium after postoperative 90Sr irradiation was observed in 97 of 1,253 cases (7.7%). Statistical analysis (uni- and multivariate) revealed, that male gender, younger age (<40 years), prior treatment (surgery and radiotherapy) and immediate irradiation (<2 h after surgery) were negative predictors for local recurrence. Temporary radiotherapy-induced side effects were observed in 15.2% of patients, including moderate conjunctivitis, local pain, visual disturbance and photophobia or an increase in tear flow. However, no long-term serious side effects were documented., CONCLUSION: 90Sr irradiation of pterygium after surgery represents a safe and effective treatment option to prevent disease recurrence.

The aim of our study is to retrospectively analyse the outcome of patients after local radiotherapy compared to literature data. Patients and Methods: In 35 consecutively registered patients, irradiated because of SVCS, different primary carcinomas (lung, breast, head-and-neck, Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma) were ascertained. Distant metastases had already been diagnosed in 33 patients. Chemotherapy had previously been given in seven patients. Result(s): In 30 patients, radiotherapy obtained a reduction of symptoms within 5-9 days. However, in seven patients, radiotherapy had to be stopped early because of local progress and tumor induced complications. Local recurrences were observed in six patients. The 1-year overall survival rate was 15.6%. Survival rate depended significantly on the performance status (p<0.004). Conclusion(s): Based on literature data our results are comparable regarding the incidence, the radio-oncological procedure and the response to treatment. These data confirm that radiotherapy is the standard treatment in most patients suffering from SVCS. However, it should be determined if endovascular stenting, which is more frequently considered in the last few years in patients with a tumor induced SVCS, may be a useful option as a simultaneous or sequentially given treatment to optimize the palliative effect.",Excluded
2954,"Mortality from solid cancers other than lung, liver, and bone in relation to external dose among plutonium and non-plutonium workers in the Mayak Worker Cohort Exposure to ionizing radiation has well-documented long-term effects on cancer rates and other health outcomes in humans. While in vitro experimental studies had demonstrated that the nature of some radiation effects depend on both total dose of the radiation and the dose rate (i.e., the pattern of dose distribution over time), the question of whether or not the carcinogenic effect of radiation exposure depends on the dose rate remains unanswered. Another issue of interest concerns whether or not concomitant exposure to external gamma rays and inhaled plutonium aerosols has any effect on the external exposure effects. The analyses of the present paper focus on the risk of solid cancers at sites other than lung, liver, and bone in Mayak workers. Recent findings are reviewed indicating that there is no evidence of plutonium dose response for these cancers in the Mayak worker cohort. Then the evidence for differences in the external dose effects among workers with and without the potential for exposure to alpha particles from inhaled plutonium is examined. It is found that there is no evidence that exposure to plutonium aerosols significantly affects the risk associated with external exposure. While the Mayak external dose risk estimate of an excess relative risk of 0.16 per Gy is somewhat lower than an appropriately normalized risk estimate from the Life Span Study of Japanese atomic bomb survivors, the uncertainties in these estimates preclude concluding that the external dose excess relative risks of this group of solid cancers differ in the two cohorts.",Included

Methods and Materials: A total of 131 porcine arteries were subjected to balloon injury or stenting followed by 0-36 Gy of ICR from a centered 32P source wire to 1 mm beyond lumen surface or a sham ICR procedure. Animals were euthanized at 4 weeks, and vessels were harvested for histomorphometry. Result(s): In the balloon-injured arteries, doses of 7 and 9 Gy did not impact restenosis. At doses of 14-36 Gy, neointima was markedly reduced, with mild dilatation at the highest dose, 36 Gy. In the stent-injured arteries, the lowest dose of 9 Gy failed to reduce neointimal growth, while 14-26 Gy showed the most favorable response. Conclusion(s): ICR with 32P features a broad therapeutic window. Doses of 14-26 Gy to 1 mm beyond lumen surface provided an optimal combination of efficacy and safety. Doses of 7 and 9 Gy were generally ineffective, suggesting a minimum threshold for ICR with 32P to effectively inhibit restenosis. Copyright © 2002 Elsevier Science Inc.",Included

439,"Mortality from diseases other than cancer following low doses of ionizing radiation: results from the 15-Country Study of nuclear industry workers BACKGROUND: Ionizing radiation at very high (radio-therapeutic) dose levels can cause diseases other than cancer, particularly heart diseases. There is increasing evidence that doses of the order of a few sievert (Sv) may also increase the risk of non-cancer diseases. It is not known, however, whether such effects also occur following the lower doses and dose rates of public health concern., METHODS: We used data from an international (15-country) nuclear workers cohort study to evaluate whether mortality from diseases other than cancer is related to low doses of external ionizing radiation. Analyses included 275 312 workers with adequate information on socioeconomic status, over 4 million person-years of follow-up and an average cumulative radiation dose of 20.7 mSv; 11 255 workers had died of non-cancer diseases., RESULTS: The excess relative risk (ERR) per Sv was 0.24 [95% CI (confidence intervals) -0.23, 0.78] for mortality from all non-cancer diseases and 0.09 (95% CI -0.43, 0.70) for circulatory diseases. Higher risk estimates were observed for mortality from respiratory and digestive diseases, but confidence intervals included zero. Increased risks were observed among the younger workers (attained age <50 years, identified post hoc) for all groupings of non-cancer causes of death, including external causes. It is unclear therefore whether these findings reflect real effects of radiation, random variation or residual confounding., CONCLUSIONS: The most informative low-dose radiation study to date provides little evidence for a relationship between mortality from non-malignant diseases and radiation dose. However, we cannot rule out risks per unit dose of the same order of magnitude as found in studies at higher doses.",Included

1356,"The Aftermath of Surviving Acute Radiation Hematopoietic Syndrome and its Mitigation Intensive research is underway to find new agents that can successfully mitigate the acute effects of radiation exposure. This is primarily in response to potential counterthreats of radiological terrorism and nuclear accidents but there is some hope that they might also be of value for cancer patients treated with radiation therapy. Research into mitigation countermeasures typically employs classic animal models of acute radiation syndromes (ARS) that develop after whole-body irradiation (WBI). While agents are available that successfully mitigate ARS when given after radiation exposure, their success raises questions as to whether they simply delay lethality or unmask potentially lethal radiation pathologies that may appear later in time. Life shortening is a well-known consequence of WBI in humans and experimental animals, but it is not often examined in a mitigation setting and its causes, other than cancer, are not well-defined. This is in large part because delayed effects of acute radiation exposure (DEARE) do not follow the strict time-dose phenomena associated with ARS and present as a diverse range of symptoms and pathologies with low mortality rates that can be evaluated only with the use of large cohorts of subjects, as in this study. Here, we describe chronically increased mortality rates up to 660 days in large numbers of mice given LD70/30 doses of WBI. Systemic myeloid cell activation after WBI persists in some mice and is associated with late immunophenotypic changes and hematopoietic imbalance. Histopathological changes are largely of a chronic inflammatory nature and variable incidence, as are the clinical symptoms, including late diarrhea that correlates temporally with changes in the content of the microbiome. We also describe the acute and long-term consequences of mitigating hematopoietic ARS (H-ARS) lethality after LD70/30 doses of WBI in multiple cohorts of mice treated uniformly with radiation mitigators that have a common 4-nitro-phenylsulfonamide (NPS) pharmacophore. Effective NPS mitigators dramatically decrease ARS mortality. There is slightly increased subacute mortality, but the rate of late mortalities is slowed, allowing some mice to live a normal life span, which is not the case for WBI controls. The study has broad relevance to radiation late effects and their potential mitigation and epitomizes the complex interaction between radiation-damaged tissues and immune homeostasis.Copyright © 2019 by Radiation Research Society.

2548,"Multilocus inheritance determines predisposition to alpha-radiation induced bone tumourigenesis in mice In a recent study, we presented evidence for genetic predisposition governing radiation osteosarcomagenesis in mice. Following the incorporation of the bone-seeking alpha emitter 227Th, approximately 25% of the variance in osteosarcoma incidence was determined by inherited genetic factors. We have now mapped 5 susceptibility loci in crosses between the more susceptible BALB/c and the more resistant CBA/Ca strains. The major QTL on chromosome 14 overlaps with a locus that was already found in our previous study, using different strains of mice. Here, we investigate the effect by which the major susceptibility locus and 4 minor modifier loci interact to influence osteosarcoma predisposition. Following incorporation of the bone-seeking isotope, 100% of mice that harbour high-risk genotypes at all 5 susceptibility loci develop osteosarcoma with an average of 472 days latency times. In 10 mice inheriting exclusively low-risk genotypes only 1 osteosarcoma was found, arising after 733 days latency time. Inheritance of distinct combinations of BALB/c and CBA/Ca alleles at the susceptibility loci confer more extreme phenotypes in terms of susceptibility or resistance than observed in either of the two parental inbred strains. From the present study, we demonstrate that additive effects of multiple alleles, each making only a minor phenotypic contribution, can combine and significantly alter tumour risk. This mechanism can be of particular importance in genetically heterogeneous populations such as man. Copyright 2005 Wiley-Liss, Inc.",Included
1530,"Benefits and challenges in bowel MR imaging at 3.0 T Abdominal imaging at 3.0 T has shown to be challenging because of a number of artifacts and effects related to the physics at higher field strength. For bowel imaging at 3.0 T, artifacts due to magnetic field inhomogeneities, standing waves, increased susceptibility, and greater chemical shift effects are of particular concern because they are likely to affect the assessment of relevant structures and counterbalance the benefits of higher signal-to-noise ratio. Regarding small- and large-bowel magnetic resonance imaging, the benefits of higher field strengths translate mainly in better contrast-to-noise ratio of contrast-enhanced T1-weighted gradient echo and T2-weighted imaging, whereas steady-state free precession sequences seem to suffer from serious degradation of image quality. The present article summarizes the technical challenges in bowel imaging at 3.0 T, provides an overview of performance compared with 1.5 T in small- and large-bowel diseases including the rectum, and revises the current literature.",Excluded
3036,"Randomized clinical trial on seven-day-per-week continuous accelerated irradiation for patients with esophageal carcinoma: preliminary report on tumor response and acute toxicity AIM: Tumor response and normal tissue toxicity of seven-day-per-week continuous accelerated irradiation (CAIR) for patients with esophageal carcinoma were evaluated and compared to conventional irradiation (CR)., METHODS: Sixty patients with squamous cell carcinoma of the esophagus were randomized into two groups: the CAIR group (30 patients) and the CR group (30 patients). Patients in the CAIR group received radiotherapy (RT) with 2 Gy/fraction per day at 7 d/wk with a total dose of 50-70 Gy (average dose 64.2 Gy). The overall time of irradiation was 3.6-5.0 wk (average 4.6 wk). RT in the CR group was 2 Gy/fraction per day at 5 d/wk with a total dose of 40-70 Gy (average dose 61.7 Gy). The overall time of irradiation was 4.0-7.0 wk (average 6.4 wk)., RESULTS: The data showed that the immediate tumor response to RT was better in the CAIR group than in the CR group. Efficiency rates (CR plus PR) were 82.8% (24/29) and 58.6% (17/29), respectively (P = 0.047). In both groups the incidences of esophagitis and tracheitis were insignificant (P = 0.376, 0.959), and no patient received toxicity that could not be tolerated., CONCLUSION: CAIR shortens overall treatment time and is well tolerated by patients. It may be superior to CR in enhancing the local response of tumor, but its remote effect for esophageal carcinoma awaits further follow-up.",Excluded
3648,"Effectiveness of postoperative radiotherapy on atypical meningioma patients: A population-based study Purpose: It is controversial whether atypical meningioma patients undergoing gross-total resection (GTR) can benefit from postoperative radiotherapy (PORT). This study aimed to investigate the effectiveness of PORT on atypical meningioma patients. Method(s): Patients diagnosed with atypical meningioma from 2008 to 2015 were extracted from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database. The Kaplan-Meier survival curves were generated, and the log-rank test was used to compare the differences among groups. Univariable and multivariable COX regressions were conducted for survival analyses. Result(s): A total of 1,014 patients were enrolled. The 5-years survival rate of the overall patients was 79.0%. PORT was performed in 315 (31.1%) patients. The utilization rates of PORT in patients undergoing GTR and undergoing subtotal resection (STR) were 26.7% and 42.2%, respectively. For patients undergoing STR, log-rank test showed that overall survival (OS) time was significantly longer in patients receiving PORT than those not (p = 0.026). For patients undergoing GTR, OS time did not show significant association with PORT (p = 0.339). In addition, patients undergoing STR with PORT had no significantly different OS time compared with those undergoing GTR with PORT (p = 0.398). Multivariable Cox regression analysis showed that receipt of PORT (p = 0.187) was not an independent predictor of OS after adjustment. Conclusion(s): PORT may not prolong the OS in atypical meningioma patients undergoing GTR. However, patients undergoing STR may benefit from PORT and achieve similar OS to those undergoing GTR.Copyright © 2019 Zeng, Shi and Guo.",Excluded

462,"Subclinical carotid atherosclerosis and early vascular aging from long-term low-dose ionizing radiation exposure: a genetic, telomere, and vascular ultrasound study in cardiac catheterization laboratory staff OBJECTIVES: This study sought to assess the association between long-term radiation exposure in the catheterization laboratory (cath lab) and early signs of subclinical atherosclerosis. BACKGROUND: There is growing evidence of an excess risk of cardiovascular disease at low-dose levels of ionizing radiation exposure. METHODS: Left and right carotid intima-media thickness (CIMT) was measured in 223 cath lab personnel (141 male; age, 45 +/- 8 years) and 222 unexposed subjects (113 male; age, 44+/-10 years). Leukocyte telomere length (LTL) was evaluated by quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction. The DNA repair gene XRCC3 Thr241Met polymorphism was also analyzed to explore the possible interaction with radiation exposure. The occupational radiological risk score (ORRS) was computed for each subject on the basis of the length of employment, individual caseload, and proximity to the radiation source. A complete lifetime effective dose (mSv) was recorded for 57 workers. RESULTS: Left, right, and averaged CIMTs were significantly increased in high-exposure workers compared with both control subjects and low-exposure workers (all p values<0.04). On the left side, but not on the right, there was a significant correlation between CIMT and ORRS (p=0.001) as well as lifetime dose (p=0.006). LTL was significantly reduced in exposed workers compared with control subjects (p=0.008). There was a significant correlation between LTL and both ORRS (p=0.002) and lifetime dose (p=0.03). The XRCC3 Met241 allele presented a significant interaction with high exposure for right side (pinteraction=0.002), left side (pinteraction<0.0001), and averaged (pinteraction<0.0001) CIMTs. CONCLUSIONS: Long-term radiation exposure in a cath lab may be associated with increased subclinical CIMT and telomere length shortening, suggesting evidence of accelerated vascular aging and early atherosclerosis.",Included
2235,"Glypican-3-mediated inhibition of CD26 by TFPI: a novel mechanism in hematopoietic stem cell homing and maintenance Directional migration determines hematopoietic stem/progenitor cell (HSPC) homing, which depends upon the interaction between the chemokine CXCL12 and its receptor CXCR4. CD26 is a widely expressed membrane-bound ectopeptidase that cleaves CXCL12 thereby depleting its chemokine activity. We identified tissue-factor pathway inhibitor (TFPI) as a biological inhibitor of CD26 in murine and human HSPCs. We observed low-level TFPI expression in endothelial cells in the bone marrow (BM), which did not increase following radiation injury. Treatment of HSPCs with TFPI in vitro led to enhanced HSPC migration toward CXCL12, as well as homing and engraftment in the BM upon transplantation. We found that Glypican-3 (GPC3), a heparan sulfate proteoglycan expressed on murine as well as human HSPCs, mediated this effect. TFPI did not affect CD26 activity, migration, or homing of GPC3(-/-) HSPCs, while it affected GPC1(-/-) HSPCs similar to wild-type HSPCs. Moreover, proliferation of GPC3(-/-) but not GPC1(-/-) BM HSPCs was significantly increased, which was associated with a decrease in the primitive HSC pool in BM and an increase in proportion of the circulating HSPCs in the peripheral blood. Hence, we present a novel role for TFPI and GPC3 in regulating HSC homing as well as retention in the BM.",Excluded

3450,"Influence of Needle Position on Lumbar Segmental Nerve Root Block Selectivity Background and Objectives: In patients with chronic low back pain radiating to the leg, segmental nerve root blocks (SNRBs) are performed to predict surgical outcome and identify the putative symptomatic spinal nerve. Epidural spread may lead to false interpretation, affecting clinical decision making. Systematic fluoroscopic analysis of epidural local anesthetic spread and its relationship to needle tip location has not been published to date. Study aims include assessment of epidural local anesthetic spread and its relationship to needle position during fluoroscopy-assisted blocks. Method(s): Patients scheduled for L4, L5, and S1 blocks were included in this prospective observational study. Under fluoroscopy and electrostimulation, they received 0.5 mL of a mixture containing lidocaine 5 mg and iohexol 75 mg. X-rays with needle tip and contrast were scored for no epidural spread (grade 0), local spread epidurally (grade 1), or to adjacent nerve roots (grade 2). Result(s): Sixty-five patients were analyzed for epidural spread, 62 for needle position. Grade 1 epidural spread occurred in 47% of L4 and 28% of L5 blocks and grade 2 spread in 3 blocks (5%; L5 n = 1, S1 n = 2). For lumbar blocks, the needle was most frequently found in the lateral upper half of the intervertebral foramen. Epidural spread occurred more frequently with medial needle positions (P = .06). Conclusion(s): The findings suggest (P = .06) that the risk of grade 1 and 2 lumbar epidural spread, which results in decreased SNRB selectivity, is greater with medial needle positions in the intervertebral foramen. The variability in anatomic position of the dorsal root ganglion necessitates electrostimulation to guide SNRB in addition to fluoroscopy. © 2006 American Society of Regional Anesthesia and Pain Medicine.",Excluded

This paper reports the first analysis of the Semipalatinsk historical cohort exposed in the vicinity of the Semipalatinsk nuclear test site, Kazakhstan. The cohort study, which includes 19,545 inhabitants of exposed and comparison villages of the Semipalatinsk region, was set up in the 1960s and comprises 582,750 person-years of follow-up between 1960 and 1999. Cumulative effective radiation dose estimates in this cohort range from 20 mSv to approximately 4 Sv. Rates of mortality and cancer mortality in the exposed group substantially exceeded those of the comparison group. Dose-response analyses within the exposed group confirmed a significant trend with dose for all solid cancers (P < 0.0001) and for digestive and respiratory cancers (P = 0.0255 and P < 0.0001), whereas no consistent dose-response trend was found for all causes of death (P = 0.4296). Regarding specific cancer sites, a significant trend with dose was observed for lung cancer (P = 0.0001), stomach cancer (P = 0.0050), and female breast cancer (P = 0.0040) as well as for esophagus cancer in women (P = 0.0030). The excess relative risk per sievert for all solid cancers combined was 1.77 (1.35; 2.27) based on the total cohort data, yet a selection bias regarding the comparison group could not be entirely ruled out. The excess relative risk per sievert based on the cohort's exposed group was 0.81 (0.46; 1.33) for all solid cancers combined and thus still exceeds current risk estimates from the Life Span Study. Future epidemiological assessments based on this cohort will benefit from extension of follow-up and ongoing validation of dosimetric data.",Included
675,"Modalities of surveillance in treated nasopharyngeal cancer OBJECTIVE: We sought to assess the efficacy of different modalities in the detection of disease during the early posttreatment period of nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC). STUDY DESIGN AND SETTING: We prospectively evaluated 57 patients with NPC who were treated with radiation. A postnasal space (PNS) biopsy, an endoscopic examination, and computed tomography (CT) scans were performed 4 months after treatment. RESULT(S): Four patients had evidence of disease in the PNS biopsy specimen. The sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values of the endoscopic examination were 75%, 94.3%, 50%, and 98%, respectively, while those of the CT scan were 50%, 49.1%, 6.9%, and 92.9%, respectively. CONCLUSION(S): In the early postradiation period for patients with NPC, an endoscopic examination is a suitable surveillance modality, but routine CT scanning has no added clinical benefit. SIGNIFICANCE: When an endoscopic examination of the PNS yields normal results, a biopsy is not necessary because the likelihood of disease is low.",Excluded
1641,"Endovascular Treatment of Long Superficial Femoral Artery-Chronic Total Occlusions Using the Gogo Catheter With IVUS Via a Popliteal Puncture Method Is Effective, Safe, and Useful Objectives: We aimed to investigate the usefulness of inserting a 6Fr sheath guided by duplex ultrasonography via a popliteal artery puncture. We also aimed to demonstrate endoluminal tracking using a retrograde approach using the Gogo catheter with intravascular ultrasound (IVUS). Background(s): The bidirectional approach is useful for increasing the success rate of the procedure for long superficial femoral artery-chronic total occlusions (SFA-CTOs). However, this procedure becomes somewhat complicated. Since the proximal blood vessel diameter is clearly larger than the distal end of the CTO and the body surface duplex guide can also be used in the proximal part, it is easier to introduce a retrograde guidewire (GW) into the proximal end. Method(s): We performed endovascular treatment for long SFA-CTOs with a Gogo catheter + IVUS guide in 31 consecutive cases (male 20/female 11; mean age, 75.6 +/- 7.6) from May 2017 to November 2018. We advanced the IVUS until the true lumen could be confirmed and advanced the Gogo catheter toward the IVUS for reinforcement. We attempted to approach the long CTO by repeating this procedure. We named this procedure the GIP method (GIP: Gogo catheter with IVUS via a popliteal puncture). Hemostasis of the popliteal artery was achieved using a commercially available compression hemostatic kit (Tometa-kun, XEMEX, Japan). Result(s): Successful revascularization was achieved in all cases (in 2 cases, a femoral artery puncture was added, and a bidirectional approach was used, and in 1 case, a CROSSER system was used). On average, the fluoroscopy time was 42.2 +/- 30.4 minutes, radiation dose 93.7 +/- 78.7 mGy, and amount of contrast medium used 15.0 +/- 9.6 mL. The procedure time was defined as from the start of the popliteal artery puncture to the time the GW passed through the CTO lesion, including the posture transformation time from prone to the supine position. The procedure time was 42.1 +/- 40.2 minutes. There were no major adverse events or other major complications, such as a distal embolism, rupture of the CTO lesion, arteriovenous fistula, or major hematoma requiring a transfusion or surgical treatment. Only 2 small hematomas occurred at the popliteal artery puncture site. The patients were treated conservatively and were discharged as usual. Conclusion(s): Endovascular treatment of long SFA-CTOs via the popliteal approach was effective and safe. Using the GIP method to address long SFA-CTOs is recommended.Copyright © The Author(s) 2020.",Excluded

1569,"Radiation necrosis versus glioma recurrence: conventional MR imaging clues to diagnosis BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Conventional MR imaging findings are considered to be inadequate for reliably distinguishing radiation necrosis from tumor recurrence in patients with glioma. Despite this belief, we hypothesized that certain conventional MR imaging findings, alone or in combination, though not definitive, may favor one or another of these diagnoses in proton beam-treated patients with new enhancing lesions on serial scanning. METHOD(S): MR imaging findings (axial T1-, T2-, and post-gadolinium T1-weighted) of 27 proton beam radiation therapy patients with high-grade gliomas were retrospectively reviewed. Entry criteria included new MR imaging enhancing lesions after treatment and histologically unequivocal biopsy proof of diagnosis. Readers rated corpus callosum involvement, midline spread, subependymal spread, new discrete multiple enhancing foci, a ""spreading wavefront"" appearance, and septum pellucidum involvement. Statistical analysis was by the Fisher exact test. RESULT(S): Corpus callosum involvement in combination with multiple other findings was highly associated with progressive glioma. These combinations included involvement of the corpus callosum with multiple enhancing foci (P = .02), involvement of the corpus callosum with crossing the midline and multiple enhancing lesions (P = .04), and involvement of the corpus callosum with subependymal spread and multiple enhancing lesions (P = .01). CONCLUSION(S): In proton beam-treated patients with glioma, corpus callosum involvement, in conjunction with multiple enhancing lesions with or without crossing of the midline and subependymal spread, favors predominant glioma progression. Overall, combinations of enhancement patterns were more likely than individual patterns to distinguish necrosis from predominant tumor progression. Together with clinical and functional imaging findings, these results may assist in determining the need for biopsy.",Excluded

Gamma Knife surgery (GKS) is an advanced modality as primary treatment for patients harboring symptomatic benign confined CSM as well as adjuvant therapy to postoperative residual tumor giving a high rate of tumor control, stabilizing or even improving clinical condition with low morbidity. Material(s) and Method(s): The aim of this study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of GKS used in the management of 62 patients with symptomatic benign confined CSM < 3 cm in maximum diameters treated at the International Medical Centre (IMC), Cairo, Egypt, from 2005 to end of 2012, with mean follow-up period of 36 months (range, 24-96 months) by reviewing their clinical and radiological data. For 51 patients GKS was performed as a primary treatment. The diagnosis was based on typical clinical and imaging findings and in 11 patients GKS was used as adjuvant to post-operative tumor residual with histological confirmation. Result(s): There were 43 females and 19 males. The median age at the time of treatment was 48 years. The mean tumor volume was 5.7 cc, the mean tumor marginal radiation dose was 14.4 Gy, the mean isodose line was 38 %, and the mean tumor coverage was 94.4 %. The optic pathway received < 8 Gy and the brain stem < 10 Gy. At most recent follow-up, 57 patients (92 %) had stable or improved cranial nerve deficits. Post-GKS cranial nerve complications were detected in five patients (8 %). Tumor volume was controlled in 60 patients (96 %) at most recent follow-up MRI; 12 patients had a reduction in tumor size and 42 had stable tumor size, while tumor size progression was detected in two patients. The tumor progression-free survival at 3 and 5 years in 40 patients who completed at least 5 years of follow-up was 95 %. Conclusion(s): Gamma Knife surgery is a safe and effective option for the treatment of cavernous sinus meningioma not only as an adjuvant to surgery but also as an alternative to surgical removal in tumors confined mainly to the cavernous sinus.Copyright © 2015, Springer-Verlag Wien.",Excluded

Methods We followed a cohort of 7033 Hodgkin disease patients who were treated in Britain from November 1, 1967, through September 30, 2000, and compared their risk of myocardial infarction mortality with that in the general population of England and Wales. All statistical tests were two-sided. Results A total of 166 deaths from myocardial infarction occurred in the cohort, statistically significantly more than expected(standardized mortality ratio[SMR] = 2.5, 95% confidence interval[CI] = 2.1 to 2.9), with an absolute excess risk of 125.8 per 100000 person-years. Standardized mortality ratios decreased sharply with older age at first treatment, but absolute excess risks of death from myocardial infarction increased with older age up to age 65 years at first treatment. The statistically significantly increased risk of myocardial infarction mortality persisted through to 25 years after first treatment. Risks were increased statistically significantly and independently for patients who had been treated with supradiaphragmatic radiotherapy, anthracyclines, or vincristine. Risk was particularly high for patients treated with the doxorubicin, bleomycin, vinblastine, and dacarbazine regimen(SMR = 9.5, 95% CI = 3.5 to 20.6). Risk at 20 or more years after first treatment was particularly great for patients who had received supradiaphragmatic radiotherapy and vincristine without anthracylines(SMR = 14.8, 95% CI = 4.8 to 34.5). Conclusions The risk of death from myocardial infarction after treatment for Hodgkin disease remains high for at least 25 years. The increased risks are related to supradiaphragmatic radiotherapy but may also be related to anthracycline and vincristine treatment.",Excluded

Study Design: Prospective blinded study. Setting(s): Tertiary care cancer center. Subjects and Methods: Informed consent was obtained and data collected from 52 consecutive previously untreated patients with HNSCC and clinical evidence of cervical metastasis. All patients underwent conventional evaluation for HNSCC and whole body PET/CT. Data were evaluated by 5 independent reviewers, who performed TNM staging per the American Joint Committee on Cancer (seventh edition) manual and proposed a treatment plan prior to viewing, and after reviewing, PET/CT. Cases where at least 3 of 5 reviewers agreed were considered significant. Result(s): There were 0 patients for whom review of the PET/CT altered the T-class assessment (95% CI, 0-6.8), 12 (23.1%) for whom PET/CT altered N classification (95% CI, 12.5-34.5), and 2 (3.8%) for whom PET/CT altered the M classification (95% CI, 0.5-13.2). For 5 patients (9.6%), overall stage was altered per PET/CT review (95% CI, 3.2-21). For 3 patients (5.8%), PET/CT findings prompted reviewers to alter treatment recommendations (95% CI, 1.2-15.9). Conclusion(s): When added to more conventional patient evaluation, PET/CT results in changes to the TNM categories, but overall staging and treatment were less frequently affected. Whether PET/CT should be used routinely for patients with stage III and IV HNSCC is still subjective and merits further study.Copyright © American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery Foundation 2018.",Excluded

Because the organ preservation trials, more patients with BCI, as well as those with soft tissue invasion (STI), have been treated with definitive CRT. This is a review of our experience. MATERIALS/METHODS:: We performed a retrospective review of patients who underwent definitive CRT or radical resection followed up with postoperative CRT for T4N0-3M0 locally advanced SCCHN. We analyzed outcomes based on STI/BCI and types of treatment. Radiotherapy doses ranged from 59.4 to 72 Gy. Concurrent chemotherapy was platinum based in all CRT patients. RESULT(S):: From 1995 to 2006, 101 patients with locally advanced SCCHN were treated definitively. Of these, 51 had STI and 50 had BCI. Of the 51 patients with STI, 42 were treated with CRT, 5 patients were treated with resection followed by CRT, and 4 patients were treated with radiotherapy alone. Of the 50 patients with BCI, 26 patients were treated with CRT, 20 patients were treated with radical resection followed by radiotherapy or CRT, and 4 patients were treated with radiotherapy alone. Five-year local-regional control was 51% and 43% for STI and BCI patients treated with CRT, respectively, and 44% for BCI treated with radical resection. Five-year overall survival was 23%, 51%, and 28% for STI treated with CRT, BCI treated with CRT, and BCI treated with radical resection. Outcomes were not statistically different between these groups. CONCLUSION(S):: This study suggests similar outcomes for CRT or resection followed up with chemoradiotherapy for patients with locally advanced SCCHN with BCI. Concurrent CRT may be viable alternative to upfront resection in these patients. Further studies should be performed to validate these provocative findings.

3358,"Association Between Radiation Dose and Outcomes With Postoperative Radiotherapy for N0-N1 Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer PURPOSE: To review trends in the use of postoperative radiotherapy (PORT) in the modern era for N0-N1 margin-negative non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) following surgical resection and evaluate the association between PORT dose and overall survival., MATERIALS AND METHODS: We performed a retrospective study of nonmetastatic stage II and III N0-N1 margin-negative NSCLC surgically treated patients within the National Cancer Data Base from 2003 to 2011. Cox proportional hazards regression was performed for multivariable analyses of overall survival and PORT dose. Radiation modalities included nonconformal beam radiation, 3-dimensional conformal radiation (3D-CRT), and intensity-modulated radiation therapy., RESULTS: We identified 2167 (6.7%) and 30,269 (93.3%) patients with surgically resected stage II or III N0-N1 margin-negative NSCLC who were treated with and without PORT, respectively. The proportion of patients treated with PORT (dose range, 45 to 74 Gy) decreased from 8.9% in 2003 to 2006 to 4.1% in 2010 to 2011. Among patients receiving PORT, the use of high-dose (60 to 74 Gy) PORT rose throughout the study period, starting at 34.8% in 2003 to 2006 and rising to 49.3% in 2010 to 2011.Overall, patients who received PORT had worse survival (hazards ratio=1.30; 95% confidence interval, 1.20-1.40) compared with those not receiving PORT. This association was unchanged when limited to patients receiving modern treatment with 3-CRT or intensity-modulated radiation therapy (hazards ratio=1.35; 95% confidence interval, 1.10-1.65)., CONCLUSIONS: The use of PORT for N0-N1 margin-negative NSCLC decreased from 2003 to 2011. We found no evidence of benefit from PORT for resected N0-N1 margin-negative NSCLC, regardless of dose or technique. PORT should be approached with caution in this group of patients, regardless of radiotherapy technique.",Included

885,"Lung dosimetry of inhaled radon progeny in mice Biological response of exposure to radon progeny has long been investigated, but there are only few studies in which absorbed doses in lungs of laboratory animals were estimated. The present study is the first attempt to calculate the doses of inhaled radon progeny for mice. For reference, the doses for rats and humans were also computed with the corresponding models. Lung deposition of particles, their clearance, and energy deposition of alpha particles to sensitive tissues were systematically simulated. Absorbed doses to trachea and bronchi, bronchioles and terminal bronchioles, alveolar-interstitial regions, and whole lung were first provided as a function of monodisperse radon progeny particles with an equilibrium equivalent radon concentration of 1 Bq m(-3) (equilibrium factor, 0.4 and unattached fraction, 0.01). Based on the results, absorbed doses were then calculated for (1) a reference mine condition and (2) a condition previously used for animal experiments. It was found that the whole lung doses for mice, rats, and humans were 34.8, 20.7, and 10.7 nGy (Bq m(-3))(-1) h(-1) for the mine condition, respectively, while they were 16.9, 9.9, and 6.5 nGy (Bq m(-3))(-1) h(-1) for the animal experimental condition. In both cases, the values for mice are about 2 times higher than those for rats, and about 3 times higher than those for humans. Comparison of our data on rats and humans with those published in the literature shows an acceptable agreement, suggesting the validity of the present modeling for mice. In the future, a more sophisticated dosimetric study of inhaled radon progeny in mice would be desirable to demonstrate how anatomical, physiological, and environmental parameters can influence absorbed doses.",Excluded
1440,"Proton beam therapy versus stereotactic body radiotherapy for hepatocellular carcinoma: Practice patterns, outcomes, and the effect of biologically effective dose escalation Background: Stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) and proton beam therapy (PBT) generally are safe and effective for non-operative hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). To date, data comparing the two modalities are limited. We aimed to identify the practice patterns and outcomes of nonsurgical HCC cases treated definitively with either SBRT or PBT. Method(s): We queried the National Cancer Database for T1-2N0 HCC patients receiving PBT or SBRT from 2004 to 2015. Patients were excluded for any treatment other than non-palliative external beam radiotherapy. A multivariable binomial regression model identified patterns of SBRT/PBT use, and propensity-matched multivariable Cox regression assessed correlates of survival. Result(s): A total of 71 patients received PBT and 918 patients received SBRT (median follow-up 45 months). SBRT was used in 1.8% of nonoperative early stage HCC cases in 2004 and 4.2% of cases in 2015, whereas PBT was used in 0.1-0.2% of cases every year. The median biologically effective dose (BED) for SBRT and PBT was 100 Gy10 and 98 Gy10, respectively (OR =0.70, P=0.17). Factors predictive of receiving PBT included: white race, higher comorbidity score, higher education, metropolitan residence, tumors >5 cm and recent treatment (all P<0.05). Both PBT (HR =0.48, 95% CI: 0.29-0.78) and BED >=100 Gy10 (HR =0.61, 95% CI: 0.38-0.98) were independent predictors for longer survival. Conclusion(s): Although not implying causation and requiring prospective corroboration, PBT was independently associated with longer survival than SBRT, despite being delivered to HCC patients with multiple poor prognostic factors. PBT may also allow for safer BED escalation, which also independently associated with outcomes.Copyright © 2019 Journal of Gastrointestinal Oncology.",Excluded
3630,"Reduced intensity VEPEMB regimen compared with standard ABVD in elderly Hodgkin lymphoma patients: Results from a randomized trial on behalf of the Fondazione Italiana Linfomi (FIL) Survival rates for elderly Hodgkin Lymphoma (HL) have not improved substantially in recent years, mainly because of a lack of prospective randomized studies, due to difficulties in enrolling patients. Between 2002 and 2006, 54 untreated HL patients, aged between 65 and 80 years and considered 'non-frail' according to a comprehensive geriatric evaluation, were enrolled into a phase III randomized trial to compare a reduced-intensity regimen (vinblastine, cyclophosphamide, procarbazine, prednisone, etoposide, mitoxantrone, bleomycin; VEPEMB) with standard ABVD (adriamycin, bleomycin, vinblastine, dacarbazine). Primary endpoint was progression-free survival (PFS). Seventeen patients were in early stage (I-IIA), while 37 were advanced stage. Median age was 72 years and median follow-up was 76 months. Five-year PFS rates were 48% vs. 70% [adjusted Hazard ratio (HR) = 2.19, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.94-5.10, P = 0.068] and 5-year overall survival (OS) rates were 63% vs. 77% (adjusted HR = 1.67, 95% CI = 0.69-4.03, P = 0.254) for VEPEMB compared to ABVD. Overall treatment-related mortality was 4%. World Health Organization grade 4 cardiac and lung toxicity occurred in four patients treated with ABVD versus no cases in the VEPEMB arm. Standard ABVD regimen resulted in better PFS and OS than the VEPEMB, although the differences were not statistically significant. The low toxicity of both treatments was probably attributable to stringent selection of patients based on a Comprehensive Geriatric Assessment that excluded frail patients.Copyright © 2016 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",Excluded
1476,"Dose escalation of gemcitabine concomitant with radiation and cisplatin for nonsmall cell lung cancer: A phase 1-2 study BACKGROUND: The current study was conducted to evaluate the maximum tolerable dose of weekly gemcitabine administered simultaneously with radiation and cisplatin in patients with locally advanced nonsmall cell lung cancer (NSCLC). METHOD(S): Patients with stage IIIA/B NSCLC received concurrently 63 grays radiation and 20 mg/m2 cisplatin Day 1 to 3 in Weeks 1 and 5, plus weekly gemcitabine at escalating doses (150-700 mg/m2) on Fridays after radiation to avoid radiosensitization. The authors assessed dose-limiting toxicities according to Common Toxicity Criteria. The primary endpoint was maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of gemcitabine. Tumor resectability, survival, and disease-free survival (DFS) were also determined. RESULT(S): Forty-two patients were accrued, of whom 95% received radiation and 66% cisplatin as above. Weekly doses of gemcitabine were escalated to 700 mg/m 2. Grade 3 dysphagia and 1 case of fatal, probably treatment-related pulmonary deterioration established the MTD of gemcitabine at 550 mg/m2 weekly. Twenty-five patients underwent surgery, and histopathological complete regression was documented in 26% of these patients. Overall, median actuarial survival and DFS were 23.8 and 12.4 months, respectively. CONCLUSION(S): Gemcitabine at doses up to 550 mg/m2 weekly can be given simultaneously with radiation and cisplatin to patients with locally advanced NSCLC. Radical resection thereafter is feasible. The impact of this aggressive therapy should be evaluated further. © 2010 American Cancer Society.",Excluded
1140,"Irradiated laboratory animal diets: dominant lethal studies in the mouse In 4 separate dominant lethal experiments groups of mice of either Charles River CD1 or Alderley Park strains were fed laboratory diets (Oakes, 41B, PRD, BP nutrition rat and mouse maintenance diet No. 1). The diets were either untreated (negative control diets) or irradiated at 1, 2.5 and 5 megarad and were freshly irradiated, or stored. The animals were fed their test diets for a period of 3 weeks prior to mating. Groups of mice given a single intraperitoneal injection of 200 mg cyclophosphamide per kg body weight served as the positive controls. Freshly irradiated PRD diet fed to male mice of both strains caused an increase in early deaths in females mated to the males in week 7 and to a lesser extent in week 4. The increase due to irradiation was small by comparison with that produced by the positive control compound. The responses for the other irradiated diets showed no significant increases in early deaths although some values for Oakes diet were high. The effect of storage was examined with PRD and BPN diet on one occasion and produced conflicting results. Thus there was some evidence that irradiated PRD diet has weak mutagenic activity in the meiotic and/or pre-meiotic phase of the spermatogenic cycle which appeared to be lessened on storage; the inclusion of such a diet in toxicological studies would therefore need to be carefully considered.",Excluded
2352,"High-tech facelift Recent technological advances in our specialty have made us reappraise the way we approach facial rejuvenation. Some of these technological interfaces have made it possible, in the author's experience, to improve results and to tackle difficult aesthetic problems. The purpose of this paper is to report how we combine these technological advances in an effort to improve the aesthetic outcomes. These technological advances are: laser skin resurfacing, endoscopy, newer fat grafting procedures, and new alloplastic materials for bone augmentation. Other technological advances are consultations via the Internet, computer imaging for simulation of possible outcomes, etc. Endoscopy is routinely used in our facial rejuvenative procedures, almost always for the forehead, often for the midface and less often for the neck. Fat grafting procedures using newly adapted concepts are used for the brow, glabella, tear trough deformity, cheeks, lips, chin, nasolabial folds, marionette lines, and other areas of soft tissue depressions apparent before or after the lifting procedures. This has allowed us to restore the tridimensional volume and treat the soft tissue atrophy. Patients with significant skeletal soft tissue disproportion due to aging, loss of dentition, prior trauma or congenital defects may receive one or more of the following implants: glabella, cheek, piriformis, angle of the mandible, mandibular body glove type of implant, prejawl implant, chin overlay or a glove type of implant. Our preference is for a porous polyethylene material because of its tissue ingrowth inductiveness. Individuals who have damaged skin due to solar exposure, aging, smoking, etc., may receive Ultrapulse CO2 laser resurfacing at the same operative setting (more often) or in a delayed fashion. The Versapulse laser is also needed for the treatment of some skin changes secondary to aging such as telangiectasias (Variable Pulse Green) and brown spots (Q-Switch 532). The high-tech facelift has allowed us to treat the severely damaged skin, fat atrophy, bone atrophy in many patients, at the same time that the lifting procedure is performed. This provides a more comprehensive approach to facial rejuvenation. The combination of different techniques and technologies maximizes the effectiveness and minimizes the potential side effects of each one. Scars in the forehead and scalp are avoided. Incision and fat removal in the lower eyelid are often unnecessary. It provides a more precise vertical lifting with correction of the tear trough deformity and gives a tridimensional restoration of the facial volume. The facial disharmony is treated at every level starting from the facial skeletal support to the most external envelope (skin). Over 200 patients have been treated this way with a minimal rate of complications. The high-tech facial rejuvenation has allowed us to improve the surgical results of our patients compared with previous isolated techniques. The combination of each one of the techniques require a precise understanding of the limits and benefits of each. Case examples of the different combinations will be shown.",Excluded
2952,"Residential randon exposure and lung cancer risk in Misasa, Japan: a case-control study In order to investigate an association between residential radon exposure and risk of lung cancer, a case-control study was conducted in Misasa Town, Tottori Prefecture, Japan. The case series consisted of 28 people who had died of lung cancer in the years 1976-96 and 36 controls chosen randomly from the residents in 1976, matched by sex and year of birth. Individual residential radon concentrations were measured for 1 year with alpha track detectors. The average radon concentration was 46 Bq/m3 for cases and 51 Bq/m3 for controls. Compared to the level of 24 or less Bq/m3, the adjusted odds ratios of lung cancer associated with radon levels of 25-49, 50-99 and 100 or more Bq/m3, were 1.13 (95% confidence interval; 0.29-4.40), 1.23 (0.16-9.39) and 0.25 (0.03-2.33), respectively. None of the estimates showed statistical significance, due to small sample size.

624,"Cerebral computed tomographic angiography using third-generation reconstruction algorithm provides improved image quality with lower contrast and radiation dose PURPOSE: We hypothesized that cerebral CT angiogram performed using third-generation reconstruction algorithm and lower contrast dose-low-kVp technique (LD-CTA) will provide better image quality when compared with regular contrast dose CTA at 120 kVp using a sinogram-affirmed iterative reconstruction algorithm (ND-CTA)., METHODS: Retrospective imaging review of 100 consecutive patients (50 each in LD- and ND-CTA groups). Two readers independently assessed the subjective image quality across multiple vascular segments on a Likert-like scale. Differences in contrast dose, CT dose index (CTDI), and dose length product (DLP) were compared using Mann-Whitney U test. Fisher's exact test was used to compare subjective image quality. Similarly, contrast- and signal-to-noise ratios (CNR and SNR) were compared in the mid-M1 MCA vessels bilaterally and the mid-basilar artery using Mann-Whitney U test. Interclass correlation coefficient (ICC) was calculated for the SNR/CNR values., RESULTS: Both observers showed excellent correlation in subjective image quality (mean percentage agreement of 95.2% for group 1 versus 89.2% for group 2). LD-CTA group showed better SNR and CNR (p < 0.0001) for both MCA vessels and the mid-basilar artery. Interclass correlation coefficient showed moderate correlation (0.51-0.63) between readers.

612,"Quantitative distribution of iodinated contrast media in body computed tomography: data from a large reference cohort Objectives: Dual-energy computed tomography allows for an accurate and reliable quantification of iodine. However, data on physiological distribution of iodine concentration (IC) is still sparse. This study aims to establish guidance for IC in abdominal organs and important anatomical landmarks using a large cohort of individuals without radiological tumor burden. Method(s): Five hundred seventy-one oncologic, portal venous phase dual-layer spectral detector CT studies of the chest and abdomen without tumor burden at time point of imaging confirmed by > 3-month follow-up were included. ROI were placed in parenchymatous organs (n = 25), lymph nodes (n = 6), and vessels (n = 3) with a minimum of two measurements per landmark. ROI were placed on conventional images and pasted to iodine maps to retrieve absolute IC. Normalization to the abdominal aorta was conducted to obtain iodine perfusion ratios. Bivariate regression analysis, t tests, and ANOVA with Tukey-Kramer post hoc test were used for statistical analysis. Result(s): Absolute IC showed a broad scatter and varied with body mass index, between different age groups and between the sexes in parenchymatous organs, lymph nodes, and vessels (range 0.0 +/- 0.0 mg/ml-6.6 +/- 1.3 mg/ml). Unlike absolute IC, iodine perfusion ratios did not show dependency on body mass index; however, significant differences between the sexes and age groups persisted, showing a tendency towards decreased perfusion ratios in elderly patients (e.g., liver 18-44 years/>= 64 years: 0.50 +/- 0.11/0.43 +/- 0.10, p <= 0.05). Conclusion(s): Distribution of IC obtained from a large-scale cohort is provided. As significant differences between sexes and age groups were found, this should be taken into account when obtaining quantitative iodine concentrations and applying iodine thresholds. Key Points: * Absolute iodine concentration showed a broad variation and differed between body mass index, age groups, and between the sexes in parenchymatous organs, lymph nodes, and vessels. * The iodine perfusion ratios did not show dependency on body mass index while significant differences between sexes and age groups persisted. * Provided guidance values may serve as reference when aiming to differentiate healthy and abnormal tissue based on iodine perfusion ratios.Copyright © 2020, The Author(s).",Excluded

Method(s): Included in the study were 19 patients (4 men, 15 women) with intracranial meningioma remnants who received hypofractionated high-energy proton beam treatment. Patients were examined with 11C-l-methionine PET and MRI prior to treatment and after 6 months, and 1, 2, 3, 5, 7 and 10 years. Temporal changes in methionine uptake ratio, meningioma volume, meningioma regrowth and clinical symptoms throughout the follow-up period were evaluated. Result(s): In 17 patients the tumour volume was unchanged throughout the follow-up. The methionine uptake ratio on PET decreased over the years in most patients. In two patients the tumour remnant showed progression on MRI. In these patients, prior to the volume increase on MRI, the methionine uptake ratio increased. One patient experienced transient clinical symptoms and showed radiological evidence of a radiation-induced reaction close to the irradiated field. Conclusion(s): Proton beam treatment is a safe and effective treatment for achieving long-term growth arrest in meningioma remnants.

In this study, 20 patients with hepatocellular carcinoma were enrolled. Functional liver tissues were defined according to quantitative liver-spleen contrast ratios >=1.5 on a hepatobiliary phase scan. Functional images were fused with the planning computed tomography (CT) images; the following 2 SBRT plans were designed using a ""step-and-shoot"" static IMRT technique for each patient: (1) an anatomical SBRT plan optimization based on the total liver; and (2) a functional SBRT plan based on the functional liver. The total prescribed dose was 48 gray (Gy) in 4 fractions. Dosimetric parameters, including dose to 95% of the planning target volume (PTV D95%), percentages of total and functional liver volumes, which received doses from 5 to 30Gy (V5 to V30 and fV5 to fV30), and mean doses to total and functional liver (MLD and fMLD, respectively) of the 2 plans were compared. Compared with anatomical plans, functional image-guided SBRT plans reduced MLD (mean: plan A, 5.5Gy; and plan F, 5.1Gy; p<0.0001) and fMLD (mean: plan A, 5.4Gy; and plan F, 4.9Gy; p<0.0001), as well as V5 to V30 and fV5 to fV30.

606,"Dosimetry and toxicity of Quadramet for bone marrow ablation in multiple myeloma and other haematological malignancies Standard treatment regimens for haematological malignancies include myeloablative chemoradiotherapy and subsequent rescue by stem cell transplantation. However, these treatment regimens have significant associated mortality and morbidity, and disease recurrence remains a problem. One alternative approach is the targeted delivery of radiotherapy to the marrow using a bone-seeking agent labelled with an appropriate radioisotope, with the aim of delivering a potentially ablative radiation dose to marrow while minimising non-haematological toxicity. Pharmacokinetics and radiation dosimetry for a commercial preparation of samarium-153 ethylene diamine tetramethylene phosphonate (EDTMP; Quadramet) were evaluated in 43 tracer (average dose 740 MBq) studies of 42 patients with haematological malignancies. Measurements of 24-h retention were also available following infusion of 18-48 GBq in 15 patients. Quadramet cleared rapidly from the tissue, with a median biological half-life of 1.4 h. Activity taken up by the skeleton was firmly bound, with activity decreasing according to physical half-life at 24 h in 29 of the 43 cases. The percentage activity retained in the skeleton at 24 h with tracer doses was high (62%+/-13%), although this decreased to approximately 30% with therapy infusions. Because of this decrease in retention, the maximum feasible therapy activity for this formulation of Quadramet is 35 GBq. Median absorbed marrow radiation dose was 0.78 Gy/GBq in tracer studies: the decreased retention at high activities means that this corresponds to a median dose of 12 Gy for 35 GBq administered activity. It is possible to use 24-h retention as a rough guide to marrow dose in individual patients. In tracer studies, median bladder radiation dose was 0.22 Gy/GBq and radiation dose to the liver was very conservatively estimated at 0.2 Gy/GBq. After therapy infusions of up to 50 GBq in 37 patients, non-haematopoietic toxicity was not seen in any patient. In addition, myelosuppression was achieved without evidence of myelofibrosis. The residual dose rate to marrow fell to a level acceptable for stem cell re-infusion by 2 weeks after administration.",Excluded

The number of ablations per artery, peri-procedural complications, procedure time (PT), fluoroscopy time (FT), dose-area product (DAP) and procedure-related complications were documented. Additionally, the radiation dose was compared between obese (body mass index >= 30 kg/m(2)) and non-obese patients., RESULTS: Bilateral RDN was performed in 50/53 (94 %) cases and with a minimum of 4 ablations per artery in 33/50 (66 %), the mean count being 5.4 (range R: 2 - 13) on the right and 4.3 (R: 1 - 10) on the left. The FT and DAP decreased significantly over the first 12 procedures, reaching a steady state with a median FT of 11.2 min (R: 7.5 - 27) and a median DAP of 4796 cGy x cm(2) (R: 1076 - 21 371), resulting in an effective dose of 15.7 mSv. The median PT was 57 min (R: 40 - 70). Obese patients had a 3.3-fold higher radiation dose (p < 0.001). We observed one severe spasm and one imminent respiratory depression, both resolved without sequelae., CONCLUSION: For an experienced interventionalist, RDN has a short learning curve with a low risk profile. The radiation dose does not exceed that of other renal artery interventions, but is explicitly higher in obese patients, who account for a large portion of patients with refractory hypertension.

618,[Stimulation of the suppressor activity in relation to hematopoietic cells in the mouse thymus as affected by pertussis vaccine] After a single intraperitoneal injection of formalinized whole-cell pertussis vaccine 5374 into CBA mice a drastic depletion of cells in the thymus accompanied by the enhancement of suppressor T-cells production is observed. T-cells inhibit the endogenous and exogenous colony-formation in the spleen by hematopoietic stem cells (CFUs). Treatment of thymus cells with the anti-I-Jk alloantiserum against a specific marker of suppressor T-cells in the presence of complement removes the inhibitory effect on CFUs proliferation and has a stimulatory action on the capacity of the marrow CFUs to form macroscopic hematopoietic colonies in the spleen compared with control ones. These results suggest probable involvement of I-J-bearing suppressor T-cells in the hematopoietic disorders induced by pertussis vaccine.,Excluded

Results showed that chronic exposure causes the reduction of hair thickness in female radiation workers than nurses. The hair root,hair nutrition,hair status and hair oil in groups showed no significant difference to each other. However,there was no significant difference in hair parameters between male radiation workers and male non radiation workers. Although attention to safety in working with radiation has increased,damage caused by radiation has not yet been reduced to zero.

3698,"Low dose ionizing radiation exposure and cardiovascular disease mortality: cohort study based on Canadian national dose registry of radiation workers OBJECTIVES: The purpose of our study was to assess the risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) mortality in a Canadian cohort of 337 397 individuals (169 256 men and 168 141 women) occupationally exposed to ionizing radiation and included in the National Dose Registry (NDR) of Canada. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Exposure to high doses of ionizing radiation, such as those received during radiotherapy, leads to increased risk of cardiovascular diseases. The emerging evidence of excess risk of CVDs after exposure to doses well below those previously considered as safe warrants epidemiological studies of populations exposed to low levels of ionizing radiation. In the present study, the cohort consisted of employees at nuclear power stations (nuclear workers) as well as medical, dental and industrial workers. The mean whole body radiation dose was 8.6 mSv for men and 1.2 mSv for women. RESULT(S): During the study period (1951-1995), as many as 3 533 deaths from cardiovascular diseases have been identified (3 018 among men and 515 among women). In the cohort, CVD mortality was significantly lower than in the general population of Canada. The cohort showed a significant dose response both among men and women. Risk estimates of CVD mortality in the NDR cohort, when expressed as excess relative risk per unit dose, were higher than those in most other occupational cohorts and higher than in the studies of Japanese atomic bomb survivors. CONCLUSION(S): The study has demonstrated a strong positive association between radiation dose and the risk of CVD mortality. Caution needs to be exercised when interpreting these results, due to the potential bias introduced by dosimetry uncertainties, the possible record linkage errors, and especially by the lack of adjustment for non-radiation risk factors.",Included

Colonic motility was analyzed in 21 healthy subjects using 84-sensor manometry catheters with 1-cm sensor spacing. Capsule endoscopy and manometry showed evidence of narrow rhythmic circular muscle contractions. X-ray images of haustra and sensor locations allowed us to identify manometry motor activity as intrahaustral activity. Two common motor patterns were observed that we infer to be associated with individual haustra: rhythmic pressure activity confined to a single sensor, and activity confined to a section of the colon of 3-6 cm length. Intrahaustral activity was observed by 3-4 sensors. Approximately 50% of the haustra were intermittently active for -30% of the time; 2,402 periods of haustral activity were analyzed. Intrahaustral activity showed rhythmic pressure waves, propagating in mixed direction, 5-30 mmHg in amplitude at a frequency of -3 cpm (range 2-6) or -12 cpm (range 7-15), or exhibiting a checkerboard segmentation pattern. Boundaries of the haustra showed rhythmic pressure activity with or without elevated baseline pressure. Active haustra often showed no boundary activity probably allowing transit to neighboring haustra. Haustral boundaries were seen at the same sensor for the 6- to 8-h study duration, indicating that they did not propagate, thereby likely contributing to continence. The present study elucidates the motility characteristics of haustral boundaries and the nature of intrahaustral motor patterns and paves the way for investigating their possible role in pathophysiology of defecation disorders.Copyright © 2021 the American Physiological Society",Excluded

3405,"Keratinocyte apoptosis in epidermal remodeling and clearance of psoriasis induced by UV radiation Psoriasis is a common chronic skin disorder, but the mechanisms involved in the resolution and clearance of plaques remain poorly defined. We investigated the mechanism of action of UVB, which is highly effective in clearing psoriasis and inducing remission, and tested the hypothesis that apoptosis is a key mechanism. To distinguish bystander effects, equal erythemal doses of two UVB wavelengths were compared following in vivo irradiation of psoriatic plaques; one is clinically effective (311 nm) and one has no therapeutic effect on psoriasis (290 nm). Only 311 nm UVB induced significant apoptosis in lesional epidermis, and most apoptotic cells were keratinocytes. To determine clinical relevance, we created a computational model of psoriatic epidermis. Modeling predicted apoptosis would occur in both stem and transit-amplifying cells to account for plaque clearance; this was confirmed and quantified experimentally. The median rate of keratinocyte apoptosis from onset to cell death was 20 minutes. These data were fed back into the model and demonstrated that the observed level of keratinocyte apoptosis was sufficient to explain UVB-induced plaque resolution. Our human studies combined with a systems biology approach demonstrate that keratinocyte apoptosis is a key mechanism in psoriatic plaques clearance, providing the basis for future molecular investigation and therapeutic development.",Excluded
894,"Usefulness of additional coronary calcium scoring in low-dose CT coronary angiography with prospective ECG-triggering impact on total effective radiation dose and diagnostic accuracy RATIONALE AND OBJECTIVES: To determine the impact of additional coronary calcium scoring on total effective radiation dose and diagnostic accuracy of low-dose computed tomography coronary angiography (CTCA) with prospective electrocardiogram (ECG) triggering., MATERIALS AND METHODS: Sixty-one consecutive patients underwent 64-slice CTCA using prospective ECG triggering, calcium scoring, and invasive quantitative coronary angiography, the latter served as standard of reference. Diagnostic accuracy was calculated for CTCA, calcium scoring, and for the combination of both. Receiver operator characteristic analyses were performed to determine cutoffs for prediction of significant coronary artery stenoses., RESULTS: Mean effective radiation dose was 2.1 + or - 0.7 mSv (range, 1.0-3.3 mSv) for CTCA and 1.1 + or - 0.1 mSv (range, 0.9-1.4 mSv) for calcium scoring. Per-patient sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value were 100%, 85.7%, 89.2%, and 100% for CTCA, and 72.7%, 82.1%, 82.8%, and 71.9% for calcium scoring. Adding calcium-scoring with a cutoff at 133 in patients aged >50.7 years with nondiagnostic CTCA improved the respective values of diagnostic accuracy of the entire study population to 100%, 96.4%, 97.1%, and 100%; the added value of calcium scoring was confined to only three patients (5%), who were reclassified from false positive to true negative., CONCLUSION: Specificity and PPV of low-dose CTCA may be further improved by combining it with coronary calcium scoring. However, only a fraction of patient may benefit, whereas exposing the entire population to more than 50% increase in effective radiation dose. Copyright 2010 AUR. Published by Elsevier Inc.

1302,"Reconstruction of complex radiation-induced injuries using free-tissue transfer The purpose of this study was to evaluate the use of free-tissue transfers for the reconstruction of radiation-induced complex injuries. The case files for patients who underwent reconstruction for radiation-induced injuries between May 1988 and November 1995 at The University of Texas M. D. Anderson Cancer Center were retrospectively reviewed. Thirty patients in whom 33 free flaps were done were included. Radiation-induced defects were located in the head and neck (n = 23), extremities (n = 4), chest wall (n = 2), and inguinal area (n = 1). The mean period between irradiation and injury was 78 months (range: 4 months to 38 years). Free-tissue transfer was successful in 97 percent (32/33 of patients). The overall complication rate was 40 percent (12/30). Flap donor sites included the fibula (n = 12), latissimus dorsi (n = 6), rectus abdominis (n = 6), iliac crest (n = 4), scapula (n = 3), and radial forearm (n = 2). Large-caliber vessels in the cervical, axillary, or inguinal regions were most commonly used to revascularize flaps. Vein grafts were used in five cases for the artery (2/5) or vein (3/5). Pedicle thrombosis occurred in three cases in recipient vessels located within the irradiated field. Two flaps were salvaged; one was lost, and the patient required a second free-flap reconstruction. The mean follow-up was 40 months (range: 2.5 to 83 months). The disease-free survival rate was 67 percent (20/30), local failures occurred in 10 percent (3/30) of patients, and 23.3 percent (7/30) of patients either died or were lost to follow-up. Healing of radiation-induced wounds may be achieved using free-tissue transfers, but complications are frequent. Large-caliber irradiated vessels maybe used to revascularize flaps, but there may be an increased risk of pedicle thrombosis.",Excluded

Reports are disparate regarding elevated lung cancer mortality risk among workers employed at uranium gaseous diffusion plants. Objective(s): To investigate whether external radiation exposure is associated with lung cancer mortality risk among uranium gaseous diffusion workers. Method(s): A cohort of 6820 nuclear industry workers employed from 1952 to 2003 at the Paducah uranium gaseous diffusion plant (PGDP) was assembled. A job-specific exposure matrix (JEM) was used to determine likely toxic metal exposure categories. In addition, radiation film badge dosimeters were used to monitor cumulative external ionizing radiation exposure. International Classification for Disease (ICD) codes 9 and 10 were used to identify 147 lung cancer deaths. Logistic and proportional hazards regression were used to estimate lung cancer mortality risk. Result(s): Lung cancer mortality risk was elevated among workers who experienced external radiation >3.5 mrem and employment duration >12 years. Conclusion(s): Employees of uranium gaseous diffusion plants carry a higher risk of lung cancer mortality; the mortality is associated with increased radiation exposure and duration of employment.",Included

Material(s) and Method(s):We recruited 83 subjects (females/males = 59/24; age 81.5+/-6.8). Body composition was evaluated by Dual Energy X-ray Absortiometry (DXA) to quantify lean mass (39.1+/-8 kg) and Relative Skeletal Muscle Mass (RSMM) (6.53+/-1.22 kg/m2). Muscle strength was measured by Handgrip test (15.7+/-5.0u). Statistical analysis was performed by three multiple linear regression models, adjusted for age and gender, on RSMM, lean mass, and (right) hand grip indicator. PA (4.69+/-0.91u) was the focus clinical predictor. Parameter estimates (b) with p-values <0.05 were considered significant. Result(s): PA appears to be positively associated with RSMM (b = 0.337, p = 0.017), and with handgrip (b = 1.51, p = 0.015). For a unit increase of PA, RSMM increases of 0.337 kg/m2, while handgrip increases of 1.51 kg. A suggestive association evidence is returned also with lean mass (b = 1.185, p = 0.075).

39,"A comparison of normal tissue complication probability of brain for proton and photon therapy of canine nasal tumors This study compared the calculated normal tissue complication probability of brain in dogs with a nasal tumor, which had both photon and proton treatment planning. Nine dogs diagnosed with a variety of histologies, but all with large, caudally located nasal tumors were studied. Three-dimensional (3-D) photon dose distribution, and a proton dose distribution was calculated for each dog. To calculate the normal tissue complication probability (NTCP) for brain, the partial brain volume irradiated with the prescribed dose was determined, then a mathematic model relating complications to partial volume and radiation dose was used. The NTCP was always smaller for proton plans as compared to photon plans, indicating conformation of the dose to the target allows a higher dose to be given. If a 5% NTCP were accepted, the mean applicable dose for this group of dogs was 50.2 Gy for photons, but 58.3 Gy for protons. Not all dogs would benefit the same from proton irradiation. If a large partial brain volume has to be irradiated, the advantage becomes minimal. There is also a minimal advantage if the planning target volume (PTV) includes a small, superficial brain volume. However, for a complex PTV shape the degree of conformation is clearly superior for protons and results in smaller calculated NTCPs.",Excluded

METHODS: A retrospective review comprised of an interventional case series of patients with pathologically confirmed diagnosis of squamous cell carcinoma of the conjunctiva and cornea, who had failed multiple standard treatments and underwent electron beam radiation therapy. Outcomes, radiation-related complications, and adverse effects were documented. Mortality and local control rates were calculated by the Kaplan-Meier survival probability method.
RESULTS: Eight patients met the inclusion criteria; of these, 6 (75%) were men and 2 (25%) were women, with ages ranging from 38 to 65 years (mean 50 years). One tumor (12.5%) was classified as T2N0M0, 6 (75%) were classified as T3N0M0, and one (12.5%) was classified as T4N0M0. Follow up from electron beam radiation therapy ranged from 3 to 72 months (mean 30.25 months). The most common side effect was erythema and edema of the eyelids with diffuse transient eyelash loss, seen in all patients. Tumor local control and regression after electron beam radiation therapy were noted in 6 patients (75%); recurrence was noted in 2. There was neither metastatic spread nor tumor-related deaths.

The technique is also used for routine monitoring of occupationally exposed workers to determine radiation exposure. An in vitro irradiation study of human peripheral blood lymphocytes was conducted to establish a dose-response curve for radiation-induced dicentric aberrations. Blood samples were collected from volunteer donors and together with optically stimulated luminescence (OSL) dosimeters and were irradiated at 0, 0.1, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1, 2, 4, and 6 Gy using a cobalt-60 radiotherapy unit. Blood samples were cultured for 48 h, and the metaphase chromosomes were prepared following the procedure of the International Atomic Energy Agency's Emergency Preparedness and Response - Biodosimetry 2011 manual. At least 100 metaphases were scored for dicentric aberrations at each dose point. The data were analyzed using R language program. The results indicated that the distribution of dicentric cells followed a Poisson distribution and the dose-response curve was established using the estimated model, Ydic = 0.0003 (+/-0.0003) +0.0336 (+/-0.0115) x D + 0.0236 (+/-0.0054) x D2. In this study, the reliability of the dose-response curve in estimating the absorbed dose was also validated for 2 and 4 Gy using OSL dosimeters. The data were fitted into the constructed curve.

Proton radiation therapy (PRT) offers dosimetric advantages for normal tissue sparing and may benefit previously irradiated patients. Here, we report our initial experience with the use of PRT for H&N reirradiation, with focus on clinical outcomes and toxicity., METHODS AND MATERIALS: We retrospectively reviewed the records of patients who received H&N reirradiation with PRT from April 2011 through June 2015. Patients reirradiated with palliative intent or without prior documentation of H&N radiation therapy were excluded. Radiation-related toxicities were recorded according to the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events Version 4.0., RESULTS: The conditions of 60 patients were evaluated, with a median follow-up time of 13.6 months. Fifteen patients (25%) received passive scatter proton therapy (PSPT), and 45 (75%) received intensity modulated proton therapy (IMPT). Thirty-five patients (58%) received upfront surgery, and 44 (73%) received concurrent chemotherapy. The 1-year rates of locoregional failure-free survival, overall survival, progression-free survival, and distant metastasis-free survival were 68.4%, 83.8%, 60.1%, and 74.9%, respectively. Eighteen patients (30%) experienced acute grade 3 (G3) toxicity, and 13 (22%) required a feeding tube at the end of PRT. The 1-year rates of late G3 toxicity and feeding tube independence were 16.7% and 2.0%, respectively. Three patients may have died of reirradiation-related effects (1 acute and 2 late)., CONCLUSIONS: Proton beam therapy can be a safe and effective curative reirradiation strategy, with acceptable rates of toxicity and durable disease control.

However, proper therapeutic strategies have not been established yet. The purpose of this study is to identify the effects of external beam radiation therapy (EBRT) for MVI of HCC. Method(s): We have analyzed and evaluated 80 consecutive patients with HCC with MVI who underwent EBRT, and factors associated with enhanced survival in EBRT were evaluated by univariate and multivariate analysis. Result(s): The local response rate of radiotherapy for the irradiated MVI was 66.2%. The time to progression of the irradiated MVI was 5.8 months. Univariate and multivariate analyses showed that the higher irradiation dose (over 45 Gy) and the irradiation location (hepatic vein tumor thrombus - HVTT) were significant factors associated with survival benefits of EBRT. The response of EBRT for HVTT was significantly superior to that for portal vein or bile duct tumor thrombus. Conclusion(s): We conclude that a multidisciplinary therapeutic strategy based on EBRT should be proactively selected in the treatment of advanced HCC with MVI.Copyright © 2019 S.

Outcomes with conventional fractionation (2-2.4 Gy per fraction; n = 27) were compared to hypofractionation (4-6 Gy per fraction; n = 36). The primary endpoint was local control and the secondary endpoint was toxicity., RESULTS: Comparable local control rates were found after 2 and 5 years (63% vs 64% and 47% vs 53%; P = .73 for, respectively, conventional fractionation vs hypofractionation). Local recurrences were predominantly present ipsilateral (92%) and within the irradiated volume (88%). Late toxicity grade >= 3 was observed in 2 of 63 patients, 1 patient in both groups., CONCLUSION: Radiotherapy fractionation schedule did not influence the local control rate or the incidence of late toxicity in patients treated with surgery and RT for sinonasal malignant melanoma in this retrospective analysis. Due to this retrospective nature and the limited number of patients, strong recommendations cannot be made. Expected toxicity, patient convenience, and workload may be taken into account for the choice of fractionation schedule until conclusive evidence becomes available.

3711,"Histopathological examination of spine tumors after treatment with radiosurgery OBJECTIVE Increased survival time after diagnosis of neoplastic disease has resulted in a gradual increase in spine tumor incidence. Radiosurgery is frequently a viable alternative to operative management in a population with severe medical comorbidities. The authors sought to assess the histopathological consequences of radiosurgery in the subset of patients progressing to operative intervention. METHODS Eighteen patients who underwent radiosurgery for spine tumors between 2008 and 2014 subsequently progressed to surgical treatment. A histopathological examination of these cases was performed. Indications for surgery included symptomatic compression fractures, radiographic instability, and symptoms of cord or cauda equina compression. Biopsy samples were obtained from the tumor within the radiosurgical zone in all cases and were permanently fixated. Viable tumor samples were stained for Ki 67. RESULTS Fifteen patients had metastatic lesions and 3 patients had neurofibromas. The mean patient age was 57 years. The operative indication was symptomatic compression in 10 cases (67%). The most frequent metastatic lesions were breast cancer (4 cases), renal cell carcinoma (3), prostate cancer (2), and endometrial cancer (2). In 9 (60%) of the 15 metastatic cases, histological examination of the lesions showed minimal evidence of inflammation. Viable tumor at the margins of the radiosurgery was seen in 9 (60%) of the metastatic cases. Necrosis in the tumor bed was frequent, as was fibrotic bone marrow. Vascular ectasia was seen in 2 of 15 metastatic cases, but sclerosis with ectasia was frequent. No evidence of malignant conversion was seen in the periphery of the lesions in the 3 neurofibroma cases. In 1 case of neurofibroma, the lesion demonstrated some small areas of remnant tumor in the radiosurgical target zone. CONCLUSIONS This case series demonstrates important histopathological characteristics of spinal lesions treated by SRS. Regions with the highest exposure to radiation appear to be densely necrotic and show little evidence of tumor growth, whereas peripheral regions distant from the radiation dosage are more likely to demonstrate viable tumor in malignant and benign neoplasms. Physiological tissue appears to be similarly affected. With additional investigation, a more homogenized field of hypofractionated radiation exposure may allow for tumor obliteration with relative preservation of critical anatomical structures.",Excluded

Design and method: A total of 126 HD patients (74m 52w; average age 61.5+/-15.8) were enrolled. All patients were dialysed by European and KDIGO guidelines. ABPM (24-hours) was performed with SpaceLab 90207 after mid-week dialysis; pulse wave velocity (PWV) and aortic augmentation index (AIx) were measured using Arteriograph after mid-week dialysis. Malnutritioninflammation score (MIS) and protein energy wasting (PEW) score were calculated in all enrolled patients. There were 67.6% of patients without prior CV disease, and prior coronary heart disease, valvular disease, atrial fibrillation, stroke, and peripheral arterial disease were diagnosed in 7.1%, 5,6%, 4.7%, 8.7%, 3.9% patients, respectively. Prior diabetes and prior hypertension were diagnosed in 26.2% and 92.4%, respectively. Result(s): There were 74.6% of non-dippers, while white coat hypertension and masked hypertension were diagnosed in 25.4% and 7.9%, respectively. During the follow up period of 48 months 69 patients died from all-cause and 53 from CV mortality. Diurnal variations of blood pressure were not associated with all-cause mortality. Neither white-coat nor masked hypertension were associated with all-cause mortality. Patients with arterio-venous fistula showed significantly better survival when compared to patients with permanent dialysis catheters and in the linear regression model MIS/PEW and PWV were the only predictors of longer survival (b =-0.371, p = 0.001; b =-0.249, p = 0.009). Conclusion(s): Blood pressure characteristics (ABPM) were not predictors of allcause mortality in patients undergoing chronic hemodialysis. On contrary, arterial stiffness and malnutrition were associated with shorter survival. Observed better survival of patients with A-V fistula compared to patients with permanent catheter is very probably reverse epidemiology.

Indications, limits, personal experience In focal kidney disease, contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) using 2 nd generation contrast enhancement allows continuous dynamic assessment of the arterial, venous and late perfusion phases of the renal parenchyma, as well as of focal lesions. CEUS is particularly useful in cases of an uncertain diagnosis after the performance of unenhanced ultrasound (US) and echocolorDoppler (ECD) (e.g. dromedary humps, hypertrophic column of Bertin, outcomes of pyelonephritis), and for differential diagnosis of simple cysts with a suspicious appearance (e.g. cysts with a dense content, calcified cysts) and complex cysts of Bosniak types 2, 3 and 4. Instead, lesions shown to be solid at unenhanced US must be directly evaluated by computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), both to gain a panoramic view and because CEUS is often unable to reveal the precise nature of such lesions. In agreement with the literature, this experience (18 cases) confirms the utility of CEUS in the diagnosis of renal pseudolesions and complex cystic formations, reducing both the risk of radiation exposure and the use of the more costly CT and MRI methodologies.",Excluded

Prominent afterhyperpolarizations that follow action potentials in these neurons strongly affect their excitability. In the present work, we have investigated the regulation of the afterhyperpolarizing current (I(AHP)) by protein kinase C (PKC). Electrophysiological responses and protein translocation were investigated in AH neurons of freshly dissected preparations of myenteric ganglia from the guinea-pig ileum. The activator of conventional and novel PKCs, phorbol dibutyrate, but not the activator of novel PKCs, ingenol, blocked the I(AHP). Phorbol dibutyrate had no effect on the hyperpolarization-activated current (I(h)) or on the A current (I(A)). Stimulation of synaptic inputs to the neurons also reduced the I(AHP), and had no effect on I(h) or I(A). Phorbol dibutyrate also reduced a background outward current that was present after the I(AHP) current had been blocked by clotrimazole. Both phorbol dibutyrate and ingenol caused translocation of the novel PKC, PKCepsilon, in these neurons. Only phorbol dibutyrate caused translocation of PKCgamma, a conventional PKC. The studies thus indicate that the activation of PKC by phorbol esters and by nerve stimulation affects AH neurons in a similar way, and that PKC activation targets both the I(AHP) and another background K(+) current. The I(AHP) is targeted by a conventional PKC, suggested to be PKCgamma, as this is the only conventional PKC that is prominent in AH neurons.",Excluded

432,"DNA alterations detected in the progeny of paternally irradiated Japanese medaka fish (Oryzias latipes) A nonmammalian test system for germ-cell mutagenesis has been developed by using the Japanese medaka fish. We describe a system for detecting DNA alterations in F1 progeny descended from the gamma-irradiated male medaka that uses an arbitrarily primed polymerase chain reaction and fingerprinting. A combination of these two methods has some advantages for screening changes in genomic DNA of individual progeny because this detection system can (i) screen for mutational events before embryos with dominant lethal mutations are eliminated during development and (ii) detect DNA changes in the progeny of irradiated males without functional selection and bias, such as resistance to chemicals. DNA alterations are detected as changes in patterns (i.e., band loss and/or band gain) of DNA fingerprints of progeny descended from males whose spermatozoa or spermatids were gamma-irradiated (4.75 or 9.50 Gy). We determined the frequency of gamma-irradiation-induced band loss in arbitrarily primed polymerase chain reaction fingerprints of DNA from severely malformed embryos with dominant lethal mutations and hatched viable embryos. The frequency of band loss in both dominant lethal embryos and hatched viable embryos increased with increasing gamma-ray dose, although more so in the former.

The system involves the ectopic expression of a hyperactive pro-apoptotic gene that causes embryo-specific lethality when driven by the tetracycline-controlled transactivator (tTA) under the regulation of a cellularization gene enhancer-promoter. We have successfully tested this system in Drosophila melanogaster. The embryonic lethality can be suppressed maternally, which will allow it to be combined with transgenic female-specific lethality systems to raise only vigorous but sterile males.",Excluded
585,"Delineating chromosomal breakpoints in radiation-induced papillary thyroid cancer Recurrent translocations are well known hallmarks of many human solid tumors and hematological disorders, where patient- and breakpoint-specific information may facilitate prognostication and individualized therapy. In thyroid carcinomas, the proto-oncogenes RET and NTRK1 are often found to be activated through chromosomal rearrangements. However, many sporadic tumors and papillary thyroid carcinomas (PTCs) arising in patients with a history of exposure to elevated levels of ionizing irradiation do not carry these known abnormalities. We developed a rapid scheme to screen tumor cell metaphase spreads and identify candidate genes of tumorigenesis and neoplastic progression for subsequent functional studies. Using a series of overnight fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) experiments with pools comprised of bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) clones, it now becomes possible to rapidly refine breakpoint maps and, within one week, progress from the low resolution Spectral Karyotyping (SKY) maps or Giemsa-banding (G-banding) karyotypes to fully integrated, high resolution physical maps including a list of candiate genes in the critical regions. © 2011 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.",Excluded
3666,"Percutaneous argon-helium cryoablation for small hepatocellular carcinoma located adjacent to a major organ or viscus: A retrospective study of 92 patients at a single center Background: Cryoablation of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) close to major organs or viscus is challenging because it can cause complications. This retrospective study aimed to investigate the safety and efficacy of percutaneous argon-helium cryoablation of small HCC located adjacent to major organs or viscus. Material/Methods: Ninety-two patients who underwent percutaneous argon-helium cryoablation between February 2012 and December 2018 at the Fifth Medical Center of the Chinese People's Liberation Army General Hospital were included. Treatment efficacy was evaluated by magnetic resonance imaging or triphasic computed tomography scan within 1 week after each cryoablation procedure. Local tumor progression, distant recurrence, and overall survival were analyzed using the Kaplan-Meier method and log-rank test. Result(s): A total of 92 patients with small HCC located adjacent to major organs or viscus who underwent cryoablation were retrospectively reviewed. The number of patients with tumors adjacent to the gallbladder, portal or hepatic vein, diaphragm, stomach, heart, and intestine was 22, 1, 39, 6, 8, and 16, respectively. Cumulative local tumor progression rates at 1 and 2 years were 2.8% and 7.3%, respectively. Cumulative distant recurrence rates at 1, 2, and 3 years were 11.1%, 17.6%, and 20.7%, respectively. The overall survival rates at 1, 2, and 4 years were 100%, 93.6%, and 74.9%, respectively. Major complications were observed in 5 (5.4%) patients. Minor complications were observed in 85 (92.4%) patients. Conclusion(s): This experience from a single center showed that percutaneous argon-helium cryoablation was safe and effective in the management of small HCC that is located adjacent to major organs or viscus.Copyright © 2021 International Scientific Information, Inc..

To determine the tolerance doses of cutaneous and mucosal tissues of normal birds in order to provide more effective radiation treatment for tumors that have been shown to be radiation responsive in other species, ingluvial mucosa and the skin over the ingluvies of 9 ring-necked parakeets (Psittacula krameri) were irradiated in 4-Gy fractions to a total dose of either 48, 60, or 72 Gy using an isocentric cobalt-60 teletherapy unit. Minimal radiation-induced epidermal changes were present in the high-dose group histologically. Neither dose-related acute nor chronic radiation effects could be detected in any group grossly in cutaneous or mucosal tissue over a 9-month period.

759,"Changes in symptom clusters in patients undergoing radiation therapy GOALS OF WORK: The goals of the study were to determine the occurrence rates for and the severity of symptoms at the middle, end, and 1 month after the completion of radiation therapy (RT), to determine the number and types of symptom clusters at these three time points, and to evaluate for changes over time in these symptom clusters., MATERIALS AND METHODS: Symptom occurrence and severity were evaluated using the Memorial Symptom Assessment Scale (MSAS) in a sample of patients (n = 160) who underwent RT for breast or prostate cancer. At each time point, an exploratory factor analysis was done to determine the number of symptom clusters (i.e., symptom factors) based on the MSAS symptom severity ratings., MAIN RESULTS: The majority of the patients were male and married with a mean age of 61.1 years. The five symptoms with the highest occurrence rates across all three time points were lack of energy, pain, difficulty sleeping, feeling drowsy, and sweats. Although the number of symptoms and the specific symptoms within each symptom cluster were not identical across the three time points, three relatively similar symptom clusters (i.e., mood-cognitive"" symptom cluster, ""sickness-behavior"" symptom cluster, ""treatment-related"", or ""pain"" symptom cluster) were identified in this sample. The internal consistency coefficients for the mood-cognitive symptom cluster and sickness-behavior symptom cluster were adequate at > or =0.68., CONCLUSIONS: Three relatively stable symptom clusters were found across RT. The majority of the symptom cluster severity scores were significantly higher in patients with breast cancer compared to patients with prostate cancer.""",Included

1203,"Initial experience with stereotactic body radiotherapy for intrahepatic hepatocellular carcinoma recurrence after liver transplantation BACKGROUND Graft hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) recurrence after liver transplant is more frequently encountered. Graft hepatectomy is technically challenging and is associated with high morbidity. Stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) has been shown to be safe and effective for the treatment of primary HCC. However, its role in HCC recurrence in a liver graft remains unclear. AIM To evaluate the safety and efficacy of SBRT for the treatment of graft HCC recurrence after liver transplantation. METHODS A retrospective study was conducted. From 2012 to 2018, 6 patients with intrahepatic HCC recurrence after liver transplant were treated with SBRT at Queen Mary Hospital, the University of Hong Kong. The primary outcome was time to overall disease progression and secondary outcomes were time to local progression and best local response, as assessed with the Modified response Evaluation Criteria for Solid Tumours criteria. Patients were monitored for treatment related toxicities and graft dysfunction. RESULTS A total of 9 treatment courses were given for 13 tumours. The median tumour size was 2.3 cm (range 0.7-3.6 cm). Two (22%) patients had inferior vena cava tumour thrombus. The best local treatment response was: 5 (55%) complete response, 1 (11%) partial response and 3 (33%) stable disease. After a median follow up duration of 15.5 mo, no local progression or mortality was yet observed. The median time to overall disease progression was 6.5 mo. There were 6 regional progression in the liver graft (67%) and 2 distant progression in the lung (22%). There was no grade 3 or above toxicity and there was no graft dysfunction after SBRT. CONCLUSION SBRT appears to be safe in this context. Regional progression is the mode of failure.Copyright ©The Author(s) 2020.",Excluded

2865,"Subsequent cooling-circulation after radiofrequency and microwave ablation avoids secondary indirect damage induced by residual thermal energy PURPOSE We aimed to investigate the exact role of residual thermal energy following microwave ablation (MWA) and radiofrequency ablation (RFA) at the final ablation and transition zones and determine whether residual thermal energy could be dissipated by subsequent cooling-circulation. METHODS In an ex vivo study, MWA and RFA were performed on fresh porcine liver, and central and border temperatures were compared. In an in vivo study, MWA and RFA were performed to the livers of New Zealand white rabbits. Tissue samples were stained with alpha-NADH-diaphorase. The coagulation zones (NADH-negative) and transition zones (lightly NADH-stained) of different groups were compared at different time points. RESULTS In the ex vivo model, the residual thermal energy after MWA and RFA could be dispersed by subsequent cooling-circulation due to the temperature decreasing rapidly. In the in vivo study, the coagulation volume in the ablation group was larger than that in the cooling-circulation group (P < 0.05) 2 days after ablation. In the ablation group, the damaged zone (the transition zone plus the coagulation zone) on alpha-NADH-diaphorase-stained images increased rapidly within 2 hours after ablation and slowly reached the maximum on day 2. However, the damaged zones did not change significantly at the three time points observed in the cooling-circulation group. CONCLUSION The residual thermal energy in MWA and RFA induced secondary damage beyond the direct coagulation zone, and it could be dissipated by subsequent cooling-circulation, contributing to smaller ablation and transition zones.Copyright © Turkish Society of Radiology 2019.",Excluded
9,"Integration of magnetoencephalography-generated functional brain maps into dose planning during arteriovenous malformation radiosurgery BACKGROUND: Magnetoencephalography (MEG) can delineate critical regions of the cortex and facilitate conformal stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) dose planning. Despite the substantial role of Gamma Knife R SRS in arteriovenous malformation (AVM) management, MEG-generated maps of critical regions have never been utilized to improve dose planning., PURPOSE: To assess the value of integrating functional brain mapping using MEG with dose planning during treatment of brain AVMs with SRS., METHODS: This case series encompassed 5 patients with motor region AVMs. Noninvasive eloquent cortex mapping was achieved using a whole-head 306-channel Neuromag R Vectorview MEG System 5-10 days before SRS. On the day of SRS, the functional brain maps were integrated onto the intraoperative dose planning magnetic resonance imaging for Leksell GammaPlan R version 10. The median AVM volume treated was 12.7 cm(3), and 18 Gy was the median margin dose., RESULTS: Functional image integration of MEG improved the recognition of critical brain structures adjacent to the AVM. This facilitated anatomical planning designed to reduce the dose to adjacent critical structures while maintaining a therapeutic dose to the AVM target. The 5 patients had no adverse radiation effects during the follow-up., CONCLUSION: Coregistration of MEG data improves the accuracy and dose sparing needed for optimal planning during Gamma Knife SRS.

384,"CyberKnife stereotactic radiosurgery for recurrent, metastatic, and residual hemangiopericytomas Objective. Hemangiopericytoma is a rare and aggressive meningeal tumor. Although surgical resection is the standard treatment, hemangiopericytomas often recur with high incidences of metastasis. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the role of CyberKnife stereotactic radiosurgery (CK) in the management of recurrent, metastatic, and residual hemangiopericytomas. Methods. In a review of the Stanford radiosurgery database between 2002 and 2009, the authors found 14 patients who underwent CK therapy for recurrent, metastatic, and residual hemangiopericytomas. A total of 24 tumors were treated and the median patient age was 52 years (range 29-70 years) at the time of initial CK therapy. The median follow-up period was 37 months (10-73 months) and all patients had been previously treated with surgical resection. Mean tumor volume was 9.16 cm3 and the mean marginal and maximum radiosurgical doses to the tumors were 21.2 Gy and 26.8 Gy, respectively. Result(s): Of the 24 tumors treated, 22 have clinical follow-up data at this time. Of those 22 tumors, 12 decreased in size (54.5%), 6 remained unchanged (27.3%), and 4 showed recurrence (18.2%) after CK therapy. Progression-free survival rate was 95%, 71.5%, and 71.5% at 1, 3, and 5 years after multiple CK treatments. The 5-year survival rate after CK was 81%. Conclusion(s): CK is an effective and safe management option for hemangiopericytomas. The current series demonstrates a tumor control of 81.8%.

2259,"Radiation dose optimization of a dual tracer PET/CT protocol for multiple myeloma: A Whole body ultra-low dose CT Aim/Introduction: To design an optimized dual-tracer PET/CT protocol for multiple myeloma and to retrospectively review the radiation dose received by patients who underwent this procedure. Material(s) and Method(s): In a research project carried out in our PET department, a dual-tracer PET/CT scan covering head to feet and a whole-body low dose CT (WBLDCT) were prescribed for patients with multiple myeloma. For the scope of optimization, PET/CT and WBLDCT were merged in a one-stop-shop. Thus, FDG PET/CT included a diagnostic CT (WBLDCT: 120 kV-80 mAs) while MET PET/ CT included a CT dedicated only for attenuation correction, referred as whole body ultra-low dose CT (WBULDCT: 100 kV-40 mAs). Both PET/CT scans covered the whole patient from head to feet, in supine position with the arms beside the body. Thirty-one patients with proven multiple myeloma who underwent this protocol were retrospectively reviewed. Demographic data and dose parameters (doselength product, DLP) were recorded. Effective doses were calculated with CT-Expo for the CT component and with dose coefficients for the PET contribution (0.019 mSv/MBq for FDG and 0.0084 mSv/MBq for MET). Result(s): We analyzed 31 patients, 23 males and 8 females, aged 59 +/- 10 years, with BMI 27.0 +/- 3.8 kg/m2. DLP expressed as median (interquartile range, IQR) was 790 (IQR: 282) mGy.cm for WBLDCT and 262 (IQR: 123) mGy.cm for WBULDCT (p<0.0001). Patients received a median effective dose of 6.4 (IQR: 2.0) mSv from the WBLDCT and 2.1 (IQR: 0.8) mSv from the WBULDCT (p<0.0001). Patients were administered 327 +/- 75 MBq of FDG and 469 +/- 50 MBq of MET. The resultant effective doses (mean +/- standard deviation) were 6.2 +/- 1.4 mSv and 3.9 +/- 0.4 mSv, respectively. Total effective dose for each PET/ CT was 12.7 +/- 3.0 mSv for FDG and 6.1 +/- 0.8 mSv for MET. Conclusion(s): In this protocol for multiple myeloma evaluation, radiation dose optimization achieved due to both, the merge of nuclear medicine and radiological examinations, and to the inclusion of a WBULDCT (with a 66.7% dose reduction respect to the WBLDCT), entailed a great benefit for the patients. An effort in reviewing each PET/CT indication could lead to the customization and optimization of protocols and to the subsequent dose reduction.",Excluded

3393,"High validity of measuring the width and volume of medial meniscal extrusion three-dimensionally using an MRI-derived tibial model Background: Medial meniscal extrusion (MME) is an important marker of knee osteoarthritis (KOA) progression. The purposes of this study were: 1) to determine whether there are morphological differences between CT- and MRI-derived tibial plateau models; and 2) to determine whether measurement of MME volume and width using an MRI-derived tibial model is as accurate as measurements on a CT-derived tibial model. Method(s): This was a cross-sectional study that enrolled ten participants with medial KOA (Kellgren-Lawrence grade 1 to 3). Primary outcome was surface difference of the medial tibial plateau between CT- and MRI-derived models. Furthermore, volume and cross-sectional area of the medial tibial plateau were compared between CT- and MRI-derived models. Measurements of MME volume and width were compared between CT- and MRI-derived tibial models. Result(s): Minimal and maximal surface differences of the medial tibial plateau between the CT- and MRI-derived models were - 0.15 [- 0.44, 0.14] mm (mean [95% confidence interval]) and 0.24 [- 0.09, 0.57] mm, respectively. There were no significant differences in volume and cross-sectional area of the medial tibial plateau between CT- and MRI-derived tibial models. The MME volumes measured on CT- and MRI-derived models were 942.6 [597.7, 1287.6] mm3 and 916.2 [557.9, 1274.6] mm3, respectively (p = 0.938). The MME widths measured on CT- and MRI-derived models were 4.2 [1.9, 6.5] mm and 4.5 [2.2, 6.9] mm, respectively (p = 0.967). Conclusion(s): CT- and MRI-derived models of the medial tibial plateau did not show significant morphological differences.

Patients and methods. - Seven radiotherapy patients were selected: three were treated for head and neck, prostate and non-Hodgkin lymphoma tumors, and did not develop any significant complications (control group); four patients were treated for bladder, thyroid, head and neck and anal canal tumors and developed serious acute and especially late reactions (hypersensitive group). Primary cell cultures of skin fibroblasts were established and their radiosensitivity studied by the clonogenic assay after exposing to single radiation doses ranging between 1 and 8 Gy. Results. - The survival fraction at 2 Gy (SF2) ranged from 0.27 to 0.38, with a mean of 0.33 for the control group, and from 0.10 to 0.20 with a mean of 0.17 for the hypersensitive group. The Mann-Whitney non-parametric test showed that the difference between the two means was statistically significant (p = 0.03). Conclusion. - The data are in favor of a correlation between the radiosensitivity of patients' fibroblasts and the reactions of different normal tissues to radiotherapy. This association supports the use of the clonogenic survival, or a surrogate test, as a predictive assay. The multiplicity of normal tissues and organs implicated in this association suggests the existence of genetic factors that determine, at least in part, the radiosensitivity of target cells involved in the expression of normal tissues complications following radiotherapy.",Excluded

777,"Predictors of Late Cardiovascular Complications in Survivors of Hematopoietic Cell Transplantation Long-term survival after hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) is now an expected outcome. The growing population of survivors is at risk of developing treatment-related complications, including cardiovascular disease (CVD). A nested case-controlled design was used to identify clinical and treatment-related risk factors for development of late (1+ years after HCT) CVD. Cases were identified from a cohort of 1+-year survivors who underwent transplantation at City of Hope between 1977 and 2006. Controls (HCT survivors without CVD) were matched on age, year of HCT, type of HCT, and duration of follow-up. Sixty-three patients with late CVD were identified, 44 (69.8%) with a coronary artery event and 19 (30.2%) with a cerebrovascular event. Median age at HCT was 49.0 years. Median age at onset of late CVD was 54.0 years; 66.7% of the affected patients had undergone autologous HCT. Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that the presence of multiple cardiovascular risk factors (2 or more of the following: obesity, dyslipidemia, hypertension, and diabetes) after HCT was associated with a 5.2-fold increased risk of late CVD (P < .01), and that pre-HCT chest radiation exposure was associated with a 9.5-fold greater risk of coronary artery disease (P = .03). Pre-HCT exposure to chest radiation and the presence of comorbidities were primarily responsible for the risk associated with late CVD after HCT. These data form the basis for developing predictive models for identifying high-risk individuals for targeted surveillance and aggressive management of comorbidities. © 2010 American Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation.",Excluded

We designed this prospective phase I trial to assess efficacy of this combination treatment for newly diagnosed GBM. Patients with newly diagnosed GBMs deemed amenable to gross total resection were included. This dose-escalation study of I-125 seeds included three 6-patient cohorts, receiving increasing doses of 3000, 6000, and 9000 cGy, and a maximal number of BCNU wafers placed surgically. Postoperatively patients underwent standard fractionated radiation to 5,940 cGy followed by temozolomide chemotherapy. During enrollment of the first 6-patient cohort, the trial was stopped when 3 of 5 patients developed radiation toxicity. Five patients (median age 55 years, range 46-64 years) completed postoperative radiation; Karnofsky Performance Status ranged from 70 to 90. This lowest-dose cohort received I-125 seeds at 3,000 cGy and maximal BCNU wafer placement, and reached endpoint (median 26 weeks follow-up). Two patients developed local disease progression (median 34.4 weeks). The 3 patients who developed radiation toxicity, which was documented on follow-up MRI and confirmed by MRI spectroscopy (median 20 weeks), underwent treatment with steroids and bevacizumab. Our phase I study was closed during enrollment of the first 6-patient cohort because of the high incidence (60 %) of early radiation toxicity.

Operative risks may be increased, but this has not been systematically addressed in published trials or reports. Method(s): This was a prospective, nonrandomized, restricted cohort design of patients (n = 200) from 1997 to 2003 with resectable cancer of the esophagus or esophagogastric junction. A total of 102 patients underwent multimodal therapy with 5-fluorouracil, cisplatin, and radiation therapy before surgery, and 98 patients opted for surgery alone. In-hospital mortality and morbidity were the primary end points, and cancer survival was a secondary end point. Result(s): In patient cohorts matched for operative risk factors, the odds ratio for postoperative sepsis (P = .007), respiratory failure (P = .009), and acute respiratory distress syndrome (P = .02) was increased in the multimodal group. There was no significant difference between groups comparing median and 1-, 2-, and 3-year survivals. Conclusion(s): Multimodal therapy was associated with increased respiratory and septic complications compared with a surgery-only cohort undergoing the equivalent surgery. Respiratory failure was in most cases idiopathic.

Distribution of other prognostic factors, including neurologic function, extent of surgery, tumor size, and sex, was comparable in each treatment arm., RESULTS: One Grade 5 radiation therapy (RT)-related toxic effect was reported (in the 54.4-Gy treatment arm), and the incidence of late Grade 3-5 RT-related toxic effects at 18 months was 1% at 48.0 Gy and 4% at 54.4 Gy. The median survival times (MST) for the 48.0 Gy and 54.4 Gy treatment arms were 11.7 and 10.8 months, respectively, comparable to the MST in prior RTOG trials with a similar proportion of patients with glioblastoma multiforme (79%). For the 123 patients who were 60 years of age or older, the MST for the 48.0 Gy and 54.4 Gy treatment arms were 8.9 and 10.4 months, respectively, and compare favorably with the MST of 6.0 months reported with standard RT and BCNU treatment used for 101 patients who were 60 years of age or older in two prior RTOG malignant glioma trials (74-01 and 79-18). Although these results differ significantly (P = 0.0015), this contrast is not significant when adjusted by performance status., CONCLUSIONS: The maximum tolerated dose of AHRT has yet to be identified, and pursuit of this information may most benefit patients with malignant glioma who are 60 years of age or older.",Excluded
2922,"Loss of heterozygosity on chromosome 5 in vicinity of the telomere in gamma-radiation-induced thymic lymphomas in mice Analysis of the loss of heterozygosity at the D5Mit143 locus was done for thymic lymphlomas induced by gamma-irradiation of mice from two reciprocal backcrosses (BALB/c x CcS-13)F1 x BALB/c and (BALB/c x CcS-13)F1 x CcS-13. BALB/c mice are susceptible to gamma-ray induction of lymphomas. The CcS-13 strain is one of 20 CcS/Dcm (CcS) series of recombinant congenic strains, and the CcS-13 mice are resistant to gamma-radiation-induced lymphomas [1, 8]. Our preliminary tests show 50% (6/12) frequency of allelic loss at the D5Mit143 locus in thymic lymphomas induced by gamma-irradiation of the mice from (BALB/c x CcS-13)F1 x BALB/c backcross. Yet, in gamma-radiation-induced lymphomas from the backcross made in opposite direction, namely, (BALB/c x CcS-13)F1 x CcS-13, the analysis with the DSMit143 marker revealed low incidence of the loss of heterozygosity, 6.7% (15). The D5Mit143 locus resides in the distal part of chromosome 5, close to the telomere. Allelic loss of heterozygosity at the D5Mit143 locus showed strain specificity.

555,"Chest wall reconstruction after full thickness resection: an experience with 22 patients The authors present their experience of chest wall reconstruction after full thickness resection in 22 patients. The patients are from a series of 80 patients treated by chest wall resection from 1967 to 1989. Whether performed on breasts still in place, for recurrent disease, or for radiation-induced lesions (which are often associated), the defect created by complete resection of the chest wall layers causes difficulties. Large cutaneous flaps, often including the opposite breast were used at the beginning of the series. Then came omentum associated to Mersilene mesh and myocutaneous flaps. The results, in terms of comfort and local control are acceptable, even though surgery is only palliative for cancer patients. We feel that full thickness chest wall resection is the only effective treatment for some primary and recurrent malignant tumors and for extensive thoracic radionecroses. Such procedures are designed to improve the patient's quality of life even if they do not actually prolong survival. The goals guiding the reconstruction programme are: (1) the restoration of a stable parietal rigidity; and (2) the reconstruction of long lasting superficial layers.",Excluded
393,"[Phosphorylation of histone H2AX in human lymphocytes as a possible marker of effective cellular response to ionizing radiation] DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) which occurs in cells after ionizing radiation (IR) or chemical agents are the most dangerous lesions in eukariotic cells, which leads to cell death or chromosome abberations and cancer. One of the earliest response of cells to DSBs formation is phosphorylation by 139 serine of core variant histone H2AX in megabase chromatin domains around DSB (gamma-H2AX), which amplify signal and makes it possible to identify even one DSB in genome. Effective formation of gamma-H2AX is very important for maintenance of genome stability. Here, using immunofluorescent and Western blotting techniques, we studied dynamics of gamma-H2AX formation in human lymphocytes of various individuals irradiated ex vivo. We have found that dynamics of gamma-H2AX formation in lymphocytes differ between individuals but have similar kinetics and statistically is independent on people age.",Included
459,"Angiotensin receptor blockade: a novel approach for symptomatic radiation necrosis after stereotactic radiosurgery Preclinical evidence suggests angiotensin blockade therapy (ABT) decreases late radiation toxicities. This study aims to investigate the association between ABT and symptomatic radiation necrosis (SRN) following stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS). Resected brain metastases (rBM) and arteriovenous malformation (AVM) patients treated with SRS from 2002 to 2015 were identified. Patients in the ABT cohort were on therapy during SRS and at 1-month follow up. Kaplan Meier method and cumulative incidence model were used to analyze overall survival (OS) and intracranial outcomes. 228 consecutive patients were treated with SRS: 111 with rBM and 117 with AVM. Overall, 51 (22.4%) patients were in the ABT group: 32 (28.8%) in the rBM and 19 (16.2%) in AVM cohorts. Baseline characteristics were similar, except for higher Graded Prognostic Analysis (3-4) in the rBM (ABT: 25.0% vs. non-ABT: 49.0%, p = 0.033) and median age in the AVM (ABT: 51.4 vs. non-ABT: 35.4, p < 0.001) cohorts. In both populations, OS and intracranial efficacy (rBM-local control; AVM-obliteration rates) were statistically similar between the cohorts. ABT was associated with lower 1-year SRN rates in both populations: rBM, 3.1 versus 25.3% (p = 0.003); AVM, 6.7 vs. 14.6% (p = 0.063). On multivariate analysis, ABT was a significant predictive factor for rBM (HR: 0.17; 95% CI 0.03-0.88, p = 0.035), but did not reach statistical significance for AVM (HR: 0.36; 95% CI 0.09-1.52, p = 0.165). ABT use appears to be associated with a reduced risk of SRN following SRS, without detriment to OS or intracranial efficacy. A prospective trial to validate these findings is warranted.",Excluded
2541,"Rotational angiography for diagnosis and surgical planning in the management of spinal vascular lesions OBJECT: The management of spinal vascular malformations has undergone significant evolution with the advent of advanced endovascular and angiographic technology. Three-dimensional rotational spinal angiography is an advanced tool that allows the surgeon to gain a better appreciation of the anatomy of these spinal vascular lesions and their relation to surrounding structures. This article describes the use of rotational angiography and 3D reconstructions in the diagnosis and management of spinal vascular malformations., METHODS: The authors present representative cases involving surgical treatment planning for spinal vascular malformations with focus on the utility and technique of rotational spinal angiography. They report the use of rotational spinal angiography for a heterogeneous collection of vascular pathological conditions., RESULTS: Eight patients underwent rotational spinal angiography in addition to digital subtraction angiography (DSA) for the diagnosis and characterization of various spinal vascular lesions. Postprocessed images were used to characterize the lesion in relation to surrounding bone and to enhance the surgeon's ability to precisely localize and obliterate the abnormality. The reconstructions provided superior anatomical detail compared with traditional DSA. No associated complications from the rotational angiography were noted, and there was no statistically significant difference in the amount of radiation exposure to patients undergoing rotational angiography relative to traditional angiography., CONCLUSIONS: The use of rotational spinal angiography provides a rapid and powerful diagnostic tool, superior to conventional DSA in the diagnosis and preoperative planning of a variety of spinal vascular pathology. A more detailed understanding of the anatomy of such lesions provided by this technique may improve the safety of the surgical approach.",Excluded
741,"Abdominal applications of 3.0-T MR imaging: comparative review versus a 1.5-T system With the development of dedicated receiver coils and increased gradient performance, 3.0-T magnetic resonance (MR) systems are gaining wider acceptance in clinical practice. The expected twofold increase in signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) compared with that of 1.5-T MR systems may help improve spatial resolution or increase temporal resolution when used with parallel acquisition techniques. Several issues must be considered when applying 3.0-T MR in the abdomen, including the alteration of the radiofrequency field and relaxation time, increase in energy deposition and susceptibility effects, and problems associated with motion artifacts. For the evaluation of liver lesions, higher SNR and greater resolution achieved with the 3.0-T system could translate into better detection of malignant lesions on T2-weighted images obtained with adjusted imaging parameters. For the evaluation of pancreatic and biliary diseases, high-resolution T2-weighted imaging using single-shot turbo spin-echo sequences is useful; improvement in SNR was noticeable on two-dimensional MR cholangiopancreatographic images. For the preoperative imaging of rectal cancer, a single-shot sequence is useful for dramatically decreasing imaging time while maintaining image quality. Substantial modification of examination protocols, with optimized imaging parameters and sequence designs along with ongoing development of hardware, could contribute to an increased role of the 3.0-T system for abdominal MR examinations.",Excluded
2082,"Effect of Denosumab or Alendronic Acid on the Progression of Aortic Stenosis: A Double-Blind Randomized Controlled Trial Background: Valvular calcification is central to the pathogenesis and progression of aortic stenosis, with preclinical and observational studies suggesting that bone turnover and osteoblastic differentiation of valvular interstitial cells are important contributory mechanisms. We aimed to establish whether inhibition of these pathways with denosumab or alendronic acid could reduce disease progression in aortic stenosis. Method(s): In a single-center, parallel group, double-blind randomized controlled trial, patients >50 years of age with calcific aortic stenosis (peak aortic jet velocity >2.5 m/s) were randomized 2:1:2:1 to denosumab (60 mg every 6 months), placebo injection, alendronic acid (70 mg once weekly), or placebo capsule. Participants underwent serial assessments with Doppler echocardiography, computed tomography aortic valve calcium scoring, and 18F-sodium fluoride positron emission tomography and computed tomography. The primary end point was the calculated 24-month change in aortic valve calcium score. Result(s): A total of 150 patients (mean age, 72+/-8 years; 21% women) with calcific aortic stenosis (peak aortic jet velocity, 3.36 m/s [2.93-3.82 m/s]; aortic valve calcium score, 1152 AU [655-2065 AU]) were randomized and received the allocated trial intervention: denosumab (n=49), alendronic acid (n=51), and placebo (injection n=25, capsule n=25; pooled for analysis). Serum C-terminal telopeptide, a measure of bone turnover, halved from baseline to 6 months with denosumab (0.23 [0.18-0.33 microg/L] to 0.11 microg/L [0.08-0.17 microg/L]) and alendronic acid (0.20 [0.14-0.28 microg/L] to 0.09 microg/L [0.08-0.13 microg/L]) but was unchanged with placebo (0.23 [0.17-0.30 microg/L] to 0.26 microg/L [0.16-0.31 microg/L]). There were no differences in 24-month change in aortic valve calcium score between denosumab and placebo (343 [198-804 AU] versus 354 AU [76-675 AU]; P=0.41) or alendronic acid and placebo (326 [138-813 AU] versus 354 AU [76-675 AU]; P=0.49). Similarly, there were no differences in change in peak aortic jet velocity or 18F-sodium fluoride aortic valve uptake. Conclusion(s): Neither denosumab nor alendronic acid affected progression of aortic valve calcification in patients with calcific aortic stenosis. Alternative pathways and mechanisms need to be explored to identify disease-modifying therapies for the growing population of patients with this potentially fatal condition.

Transthoracic echocardiography (TTE), transesophageal echocardiography (TEE), angiography, and follow-up investigations of pulmonic stenosis (PS) with R2A CA were carried out to compare different diagnostic methods., RESULTS: Based on the TTE morphology, PS with an aberrant CA was suspected in all dogs (n = 22) and later confirmed by angiography in 18 cases (18/22), and necropsy in two cases (2/22). In 12 cases (12/22), TEE and angiography were both performed and confirmed the diagnosis of an R2A anomaly. Two cases (2/22) were diagnosed only with TEE., CONCLUSIONS: Transesophageal echocardiography may be considered an effective tool to diagnose CA abnormalities, in particular when TTE is inconclusive. Transesophageal echocardiography offers detailed and easily reproducible views of coronary ostia, and the spatial relationship between the right common CA and the great arteries. Although it is not possible to define the course of the more distal coronary branches, TEE has proven reliable in recognizing those elements that can constitute a risk for the execution of a balloon valvuloplasty (BV). Therefore, TEE can be used to confirm this type of CA anomaly and prevent a BV, which is contraindicated in these cases. In addition, TEE avoids any further vascular access, radiation exposure, and contrast medium injection. Copyright © 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",Excluded

The purpose of this study was to compare and contrast the clinical and sialographic imaging features of 131I radiation-induced submandibular gland sialadenitis to 131I radiation-induced parotitis. Patients and Methods: This retrospective cross-sectional study included patients with 131I radiation-induced submandibular gland sialadenitis and parotitis. Clinical records and sialographic image features were evaluated. The predictor variables included age at the time of diagnosis, gender, course of the disease, site of symptoms, and sialographic image grades. The outcome variable was the location of sialadenitis. A student t-test was conducted to analyze the associations between predictor variables and the outcome. Result(s): The sample was composed of 4 patients with submandibular gland sialadenitis (100% female), 28 with parotitis (85.7% female), and 1 with submandibular gland sialadenitis and parotitis (P <.05). The occurrence of bilateral glands dysfunction was less often in submandibular glands (SMG: 1/4; PG: 19/28). The age and course of disease were not different between submandibular gland sialadenitis and parotitis (Age, SMG: 46.00 +/- 13.59 years; PG: 50.04 +/- 10.71 years, P >.05; Course of the disease, SMG: 11.00 +/- 16.69 months; PG: 6.96 +/- 11.18 months, P >.05). Radiographically, 7 of 16 patients with parotitis were identified as grade 2 and 9 patients as grade 3. In 3 patients with submandibular gland sialadenitis, 1 patient was identified as grade 2 and 2 patients as grade 3. The postoperative pathological results showed that the proliferation of glandular tissue from the hilum of the submandibular gland caused duct stenosis. Conclusion(s): The results suggest 131I radiation-induced submandibular gland sialadenitis has a lower incidence compared with parotitis and 131I radiation-induced submandibular gland sialadenitis might be related to duct stenosis caused by proliferative glandular tissue after 131I radiation treatment.Copyright © 2020 American Association of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgeons",Excluded

Here, we established a mouse model to study the development and progression of radiation-induced atherosclerosis and to compare the phenotype of these lesions with age-related atherosclerosis. Atherosclerosis-prone ApoE-/- mice fed a regular chow diet received single radiation doses of 14 Gy or sham treatments (0 Gy) to the neck, including both carotid arteries. At 22, 28, and 34 weeks after irradiation, blood samples were taken, and the arterial tree was removed for histological examination. Cholesterol levels in irradiated mice were not significantly different from age-matched controls, and markers of systemic inflammation (soluble intercellular adhesion molecule-1, soluble vascular cell adhesion molecule-1, and C-reactive protein) were not elevated. The lesions in irradiated arteries were macrophage rich, with a remarkable influx of inflammatory cells, predominantly granulocytes. Intraplaque hemorrhage and erythrocyte-containing macrophages were seen only in lesions of irradiated arteries. Based on these data, we propose that irradiation accelerates the development of macrophage-rich, inflammatory atherosclerotic lesions prone to intraplaque hemorrhage.",Included
3552,"Characteristics, sources and health risk assessment of airborne particulate PAHs in Chinese cities: A review Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) are organic compounds composed of at least two benzene rings. This paper reviews the characteristics, sources and health risk of airborne particulate PAHs in Chinese cities. The airborne particulate PAH concentrations varied from 3.35 to 910ngm-3, with an average of 75.0ngm-3, and the pollution level of PAHs in northern cities was generally higher than that in southern cities. The PAH concentrations in different cities underwent similar seasonal variations, with high concentrations in the winter and relatively low concentrations in the summer. Many factors, such as meteorological conditions and source emissions, influenced the spatiotemporal pattern of PAHs. High temperatures, frequent flow exchanges, abundant rainfall and strong solar radiation reduced the level of particulate PAHs in the atmosphere. The historical changes in the level of airborne particulate PAHs in four cities were analyzed. The PAH concentrations in Beijing and Taiyuan presented a trend of first increasing and then decreasing, while the level of particulate PAHs in Nanjing and Guangzhou had a decreasing tendency from year 2000-2015. The airborne particulate PAHs in cities were derived from several sources, including coal combustion, vehicle emissions, coking industries, biomass burning and petroleum volatilization. The results of a health risk assessment indicated that the incremental lifetime cancer risk (ILCR) for people in the northern cities was higher than that for people in the other regions, especially during the cold season. Moreover, adults were at greater risk than people in other age groups, and the health risk to females was slightly higher than that to males. The potential risk of airborne particulate PAH exposure was relatively high in some cities, and controlling PAH emissions at the source should be required to prevent pollution.

246,"3D histomorphometric quantification of trabecular bones by computed microtomography using synchrotron radiation Conventional bone histomorphometry is an important method for quantitative evaluation of bone microstructure. X-ray computed microtomography is a non-invasive technique, which can be used to evaluate histomorphometric indices in trabecular bones (BV/TV, BS/BV, Tb.N, Tb.Th, Tb.Sp). In this technique, 3D images are used to quantify the whole sample, differently from the conventional one, in which the quantification is performed in 2D slices and extrapolated for 3D case. In this work, histomorphometric quantification using synchrotron 3D X-ray computed microtomography was performed to quantify the bone structure at different skeletal sites as well as to investigate the effects of bone diseases on quantitative understanding of bone architecture. The images were obtained at Synchrotron Radiation for MEdical Physics (SYRMEP) beamline, at ELETTRA synchrotron radiation facility, Italy. Concerning the obtained results for normal and pathological bones from same skeletal sites and individuals, from our results, a certain declining bone volume fraction was achieved.

Our purpose is to report our clinical experience with patients who underwent endovascular treatment with Wallstents for subacute or chronic benign obstruction of the superior vena cava (SVC). SUBJECTS AND METHODS. Twelve patients who were an average of 54 +/- 12 years old were referred for treatment of severe SVC syndrome related to implanted central venous catheters (n = 8), postradiation fibrosis (n = 2), a permanent pacemaker (n = 1), or a benign tumor (n = 1). Symptoms were present for an average of 16 weeks (range, 4-48 weeks) before treatment. Diagnosis of SVC obstruction was confirmed with helical CT and pretherapeutic phlebography. Four patients had Stanford's type II stenosis; two, type III; and six, type IV. The mean clinical and radiologic follow-up intervals were 11 months (range, 1-36 months) and 7 months (range, 1 week to 32 months), respectively. RESULTS. Recanalization was successful in all patients. Fifteen stents were implanted in the 12 patients. Stents were placed after percutaneous balloon angioplasty in nine patients, and primary stent placement was attempted in three patients. We immediately achieved a satisfactory SVC diameter in all patients, whose symptoms were relieved completely within 1 week of stent placement. No technical or clinical complications occurred. SVC syndrome recurred in one patient 2 months after stent placement and was treated by placing a second stent. CONCLUSION. Endovascular treatment with stent placement should be considered relevant and safe for refractory benign SVC syndrome. However, a larger series and a longer follow-up period are needed to define the role of stent placement for this syndrome.",Excluded

The relationship between bowel volume at various dose levels and prospectively collected late bowel toxicity was explored., RESULTS: Fifteen per cent and 6% of patients experienced grade 1 and grade 2 or more late bowel toxicity, respectively. The mean bowel volume was significantly less at doses >=50 Gy in those treated with reduced high dose volume radiotherapy compared with standard radiotherapy. The probability of late bowel toxicity increased as bowel volume increased (P <= 0.05 for dose levels 30-50 Gy). No grade 2 or more late bowel toxicity was observed in patients with bowel volumes under the thresholds given in the model that predict for 25% probability of late bowel toxicity., CONCLUSIONS: There is a dose volume effect for late bowel toxicity in radical bladder radiotherapy.

Here we identify and characterize mammalian Swi5 and Sfr1 homologues. Mouse Swi5 and Sfr1 are nuclear proteins that form a complex in vivo and in vitro. Swi5 interacts in vitro with Rad51, the DNA strand-exchange protein which functions during HR. By generating Swi5(-/-) and Sfr1(-/-) embryonic stem cell lines, we found that both proteins are mutually interdependent for their stability. Importantly, the Swi5-Sfr1 complex plays a role in HR when Rad51 function is perturbed in vivo by expression of a BRC peptide from BRCA2. Swi5(-/-) and Sfr1(-/-) cells are selectively sensitive to agents that cause DNA strand breaks, in particular ionizing radiation, camptothecin, and the Parp inhibitor olaparib. Consistent with a role in HR, sister chromatid exchange induced by Parp inhibition is attenuated in Swi5(-/-) and Sfr1(-/-) cells, and chromosome aberrations are increased. Thus, Swi5-Sfr1 is a newly identified complex required for genomic integrity in mammalian cells with a specific role in the repair of DNA strand breaks.",Excluded
2562,"Comparison of magnetic wire navigation with the conventional wire technique for percutaneous coronary intervention of chronic total occlusions: a randomised, controlled study Wire crossing of a chronic total coronary occlusion (CTO) is time consuming and limited by the amount of contrast agent and time of radiation exposure.

Forty symptomatic patients with CTO were randomised to MWN (n = 20) or conventional approach (n = 20) for antegrade crossing of the occlusion. In the intention-to-treat analysis, MWN showed a shorter crossing time (412 versus 1131 s; p = 0.001), and, consequently, lower usage of contrast agent (primary endpoint 42 versus 116 ml; p = 0.01), and lower radiation exposure (dose-area product: 29 versus 80 Gy*cm(2); p = 0.002) during wire crossing compared to the conventional approach. Accordingly, in the per-protocol analysis, the wire-crossing rate was, in trend, higher using the conventional approach (17 of 31) compared to MWN (9 of 28; p = 0.08). The use of MWN for revascularisation of CTOs is feasible and reduces crossing time, use of contrast agent, and radiation exposure. However, due to a broader selection of wires, the conventional approach enables wire crossing in cases failed by MWN and seems to be the more successful choice.",Excluded

687,"The use of a fully integrated electronic medical record to minimize cumulative lifetime radiation exposure from CT scanning to detect urinary tract calculi In order to determine the effects of implementation of an electronic medical record on rates of repeat computed tomography (CT) scanning in the emergency department (ED) setting, we analyzed the utilization of CT of the kidneys, ureters, and bladder (CT KUB) for the detection of urinary tract calculi for periods before and after the implementation of a hospital-wide electronic medical record system. Rates of repeat CT scanning within a 6-month period of previous scan were determined pre- and post-implementation and compared. Prior to implementation, there was a 6-month repeat rate of 6.2 % compared with the post-implementation period, which was associated with a 6-month repeat rate of 4.1 %. Statistical analysis using a two-sample, one-tailed t test for difference of means was associated with a p value of 0.00007. This indicates that the implementation of the electronic medical record system was associated with a 34 % decrease in 6-month repeat CT KUB scans. We conclude that the use of an electronic medical record can be associated with a decrease in utilization of unnecessary repeat CT imaging, leading to decreased cumulative lifetime risk for cancer in these patients and more efficient utilization of ED and radiologic resources. © 2013 Am Soc Emergency Radiol.",Excluded
1236,"Collaborative exercise on the use of FISH chromosome painting for retrospective biodosimetry of Mayak nuclear-industrial personnel PURPOSE: To investigate within the framework of a multilaboratory study the suitability of FISH chromosome painting to measure so-called stable translocations in peripheral lymphocytes of Mayak nuclear-industrial workers (from the Southern Urals) and their use for retrospective biodosimetry., MATERIALS AND METHODS: Chromosime analyses were carried out from 69 workers who had received protracted occupational radiation exposures (0.012-6.065 Gy) up to approximately 40 years before blood sampling. Twenty-one unexposed people living in the same area were controls. A multicolour FISH-painting protocol with the target chromosomes 1, 4 and 8 simultaneously with a pancentromeric probe was used to score potentially transmissible chromosome-type aberrations (reciprocal translocations 2B and related 'one-way' patterns I-III according to the S&S classification)., RESULTS: Individual biodosimetry estimates were obtained in terms of these potentially long-term surviving aberration types based on the linear component of a low dose-rate gamma-ray calibration curve produced using identical staining and scoring protocols. For comparison, the workers personal and total background doses were converted to red bone marrow doses. The estimated doses were mainly lower than would be predicted by the calibration curve, particularly at accumulated higher dose levels., CONCLUSIONS: Owing to the limited life-time of circulating T-lymphocytes, the long-term persistence of translocations in vivo requires the assumption of a clonal repopulation of these naturally senescing cells from the haemopoietic stem cell compartments. Obviously such a replacement cannot be fully achieved, leading to a temporal decline even of the yield of transmissible aberrations types. Assuming further a highly selective capacity of stem cells against any type of chromosomal damage and the fact that one must rely on partial genome findings, the potential of FISH chromosome painting for retrospective dose reconstruction is probably limited to a decade or so after high-level protracted radiation exposure.",Included

Initial reports using single-stage radiosurgery have demonstrated excellent tumor control rates. Many patients now elect to undergo radiosurgery given the potential for tumor control while avoiding the morbidity associated with microsurgical resection. In attempt to improve hearing preservation rates of single-state radiosurgery, staged frame-based radiotherapy using a 12-hour interfraction interval was used at the authors' institution and has shown a hearing preservation rate of 77% at 2 years of follow-up. With the arrival of the Cyberknife, a frameless, image-guided radiotherapy system, staged stereotactic radiotherapy for vestibular schwannoma became more practical.

2940,"The Artemis Program: An Overview of NASA's Activities to Return Humans to the Moon NASA is developing a two-phased approach to quickly return humans to the Moon and establish a sustainable presence in orbit and on the surface. The two phases run in parallel, and both have already begun, with selection of the first Gateway element, the Power and Propulsion Element, solicitation activities focused on an American-built, industry-provided Human Landing System, and discussions with industry and international partners about potential opportunities for collaboration. Phase 1 is driven exclusively by the administration's priority to land the first woman and the next man on the lunar South Pole by 2024. In this phase, NASA and its partners will develop and deploy two Gateway components: the Power and Propulsion Element (PPE) that will launch in 2022, and the Habitation and Logistics Outpost (HALO), a minimal habitation capability) that will launch in 2023. Both will launch on commercial rockets, as will Gateway logistics deliveries to outfit the ship and provide supplies for surface expeditions. This initial Gateway configuration represents the beginning of its capability buildup, and the primary components required to support the first human expedition to the lunar South Pole. NASA's baseline reference approach for human expeditions on the surface is for Human Landing Systems to aggregate and dock to the Gateway, then deploy to the lunar South Pole with two astronauts aboard. Phase 2 is focused on advancing the technologies that will foster a sustainable presence on and around the Moon - a lasting and productive presence enabled by reusable systems, access for a diverse body of contributing partners, and repeatable trips to multiple destinations across the lunar surface. In this Phase, we will advance sustainable systems to make surface expeditions more repeatable and affordable. While the Gateway is the first of its kind to be funded, the concept has been proposed for decades as a necessary and foundational capability for a sustainable return to the Moon, and a port for vehicles embarking to farther destinations. It supports every tenet of Space Policy Directive-1 and the infrastructure it provides is critical to an accelerated return to the Moon, and access to more parts of the Moon than ever before. The Gateway also provides a unique platform to conduct cross-discipline science. Science instruments, both internal and external to the Gateway, have the potential to reveal new findings in space science, Earth science, and biological research data from deep space. Additionally, the broad science community will be able to utilize the communications and data relay capabilities of the Gateway, beginning with the PPE in Phase 1. This paper will outline the cross-discipline activities NASA is currently conducting, and those the agency anticipates conducting in the future to successfully implement Phases 1 and 2 in the lunar vicinity, all while preparing for humanity's next giant leap: Mars. 2020 IEEE.",Excluded

657,"Limiting values for the RBE of fission neutrons at low doses for life shortening in mice We have analyzed recently published data on the effects of low doses of fission neutrons on the mean survival times of mice. The analysis for single-dose exposures was confined to doses of 20 rad or less, while for fractionated exposures only total doses of 80 rad or less were considered. We fitted the data to the frequently used power function model: life shortening = beta D lambda, where D is the radiation dose. We show that, at low doses per fraction, either (1) the effects are not additive or (2) the dose-effect curve for single exposures cannot show a greater negative curvature than about the 0.9 power of dose. Analysis of the data for gamma rays showed that an exponent of 1.0 gave an acceptable fit. Taken together, these findings indicate that the RBE for neutrons cannot change more rapidly with neutron dose than about RBEN approximately = k/D0.1N. This conflicts with the more widely accepted relationship, RBEN approximately = k/D0.5N. Because of the inherent implausibility of exponents less than 1.0 for the neutron dose-effect curves at low doses we conclude that at neutron doses of 20 rad or less the RBE for life shortening is constant and ranges from 13 to 22 depending on mouse strain and sex.",Included

Fifty-nine animals were given the opportunity to participate in cognitive cage-side testing. The animals that received single-dose gamma irradiation were significantly less likely to engage in cognitive testing than the controls, suggesting that irradiated animals may have differences in cognitive ability. Five irradiated (6.75-8.05 Gy) and three naive control animals self-selected, were extensively trained and administered a simple visual discrimination with reversal (SVD+R) task 2-3 times per week for 11-18 months. Each session consisted of 30 trials in which the animals were required to choose the correct visual stimulus for a food reward. After the initial presentation, the stimulus that signaled the presence of food was twice reversed once the animal reached criterion (90% accuracy across four consecutive sessions). While the limited sample size precluded definitive statistical analysis, irradiated animals took longer to reach the criterion subsequent to reversal than did control animals, suggesting a relative deficiency in cognitive flexibility. These results provide preliminary data supporting the potential use of a nonhuman primate model to study radiation-induced, late-delayed cognitive deficits.",Included

Method(s): Dosimetry estimates were calculated in subjects undergoing imaging studies to help define the radiation risk of [11C]-glucose PET imaging. Time-dependent radioactivity concentrations in normal tissues in 33 subjects after intravenous injection of [11C]-glucose were obtained by PET imaging. Radiation absorbed doses were calculated according to the procedures of the Medical Internal Radiation Dose (MIRD) committee along with the variation in dose based on the calculated standard deviation of activity distribution seen in the individual patients. Result(s): Total body exposure was a median of 3.0 muGy/MBq in men and 3.8 muGy/MBq in women. The effective dose equivalent was 3.8 muGy/MBq in men and 4.8 muGy/MBq in women. The critical organs were those that typically take up the most glucose (brain, heart wall and liver).

This study aims to determine radiation dose received by relatives who care for non self-supporting I-131 patients at Siriraj Hospital. Material(s) and Method(s): Twenty caregivers of 20 patients underwent I-131 therapy for thyroid cancer with a standard protocol were given specific instructions with regard to radiation safety and provided with electronic digital dosimeter to continuously measure radiation dose received on daily basis, three days in the hospital. On the day patient is released, thyroid uptake estimates were performed to assess internal radiation dose received by caregivers. Result(s): The 3-day accumulative doses to caregivers to patients receiving 150 mCi (n = 11) and 200 mCi (n = 9) of I-131 ranged from 37 to 333 muSv and 176 to 1,920 muSv respectively depending on the level of supports required. Thyroid uptake estimates in all caregivers were undetectable. Dosimeter indicated a maximum whole-body dose of 1.92 mSv was more than the public dose limit of 1 mSv but within the dose constraint of 5 mSv for caregivers. Discussion(s): Radiation dose to caregivers of a non self-supporting hospitalized patient undergoing I-131 therapy were well below the limits recommended by the ICRP. The patients can be comforted with confidence that dose to caregivers will be less than the limit.

72,"Effect of oral administration of Hypericum perforatum extract (St. John's wort) on skin erythema and pigmentation induced by UVB, UVA, visible light and solar simulated radiation Hypericin from St John's wort (Hypericum perforatum L.) is a photosensitizing agent that may cause a severe photodermatitis when higher amounts of St John's wort are ingested by animals. Although Hypericum extracts are widely used in the treatment of depressive disorders, only a little information on the photosensitizing capacity of St John's wort in humans is available. In the present prospective randomized study we investigated the effect of the Hypericum extract LI 160 on skin sensitivity to ultraviolet B (UVB), ultraviolet A (UVA), visible light (VIS) and solar simulated radiation (SIM). Seventy two volunteers of skin types II and III were included and were divided into six groups, each consisting of 12 volunteers. In the single-dose study the volunteers (n = 48) received 6 or 12 coated tablets (5400 or 10800 mug hypericin). In the steady-state study the volunteers (n = 24) received an initial dose of 6 tablets (5400 mug hypericin), and subsequently 3 x 1 tablets (2700 mug hypericin) per day for 7 days. Phototesting was performed on the volar forearms prior to medication and 6 h after the last administration of Hypericum extract. The erythema-index and melanin-index were evaluated photometrically using a mexameter. After both single-dose and steady-state administration, no significant influence on the erythema-index or melanin-index could be detected, with the exception of a marginal influence on UVB induced pigmentation (p = 0.0471) in the single-dose study. The results do not provide evidence for a phototoxic potential of the Hypericum extract LI 160 in humans when administered orally in typical clinical doses up to 1800 mg daily. This is in accordance with previous pharmacokinetics studies that found hypericin serum and skin levels after oral ingestion of Hypericum extract always to be lower than the assumed phototoxic hypericin threshold level of 1000 ng/mL.

To gain insight into the molecular mechanisms that underlie radiation-associated meningioma (RAM), we characterized the somatic genetic alterations in 16 RAMs by using comparative genomic hybridization and compared the pattern of alterations with 17 nonradiation-associated meningiomas (non-RAM). Most tumors (29/33;87.9%) displayed at least one DNA copy number alteration, and 11 out of 33 (33%) exhibited four or more changes. The mean number of DNA copy number changes was similar in RAMs (2.4+/-1.9) and in non-RAMs (2.5+/-1.9). The most common DNA losses were noted in chromosome 22 (56.2% in RAM, and 47% in non-RAM) and chromosome 1 (37.5% in RAM and 35.3% in non-RAM), with no significant differences between the two groups. Noteworthy, gain in DNA copy number of chromosomes 8 and 12 was detected in two RAM tumors only.

2733,"Projected lifetime cancer risks from occupational radiation exposure among diagnostic medical radiation workers in South Korea BACKGROUND: Timely assessment of cancer risk from current radiation exposure among medical radiation workers can contribute to the development of strategies to prevent excessive occupational radiation exposure. The purpose of the present study is to estimate the lifetime risk of cancers induced by occupational radiation exposure among medical radiation workers., METHODS: Using estimated organ doses and the RadRAT risk assessment tool, the lifetime cancer risk was estimated among medical radiation workers who were enrolled in the Korean National Dose Registry from 1996 to 2011. Median doses were used for estimating the risk because of the skewed distribution of radiation doses. Realistic representative exposure scenarios in the study population based on sex, job start year, and occupational group were created for calculating the lifetime attributable risk (LAR) and lifetime fractional risk (LFR)., RESULTS: The mean estimated lifetime cancer risk from occupational radiation exposure varied significantly by sex and occupational group. The highest LAR was observed in male and female radiologic technologists who started work in 1991 (264.4/100,000 and 391.2/100,000, respectively). Female workers had a higher risk of radiation-related excess cancer, although they were exposed to lower radiation doses than male workers. The higher LAR among women was attributable primarily to excess breast and thyroid cancer risks. LARs among men were higher than women in most other cancer sites. With respect to organ sites, LAR of colon cancer (44.3/100,000) was the highest in male radiologic technologists, whereas LAR of thyroid cancer (222.0/100,000) was the highest in female radiologic technologists among workers who started radiologic practice in 1991. Thyroid and bladder cancers had the highest LFR among radiologic technologists., CONCLUSIONS: Our findings provide an assessment of the potential cancer risk from occupational radiation exposure among medical radiation workers, based on current knowledge about radiation risk. Although the radiation-related risk was small in most cases, it varied widely by sex and occupational group, and the risk would be underestimated due to the use of median, rather than mean, doses. Therefore, careful monitoring is necessary to optimize radiation doses and protect medical radiation workers from potential health risks, particularly female radiologic technologists.",Included

OBJECT: The object of this study was to determine whether the radiation dose rate affects clinical outcomes in patients who undergo stereotactic Gamma Knife surgery (GKS) to manage typical trigeminal neuralgia (TN)., METHODS: The authors retrospectively studied pain relief in 165 patients with medically intractable TN, who underwent 80-Gy GKS using a single 4-mm collimator between 1994 and 2005. No patient had received prior radiation treatment. The measured relative helmet output factor of the Gamma Knife was 0.8 throughout this interval, and the dose rate varied from 1.21 Gy/minute to 3.74 Gy/minute (median 2.06 Gy/minute). Irradiation time varied from 26.73 to 95.11 minutes. The authors divided patients into a low-dose-rate (LDR) group, in which the dose rate varied from 1.21 to 2.05 Gy/minute, and a high-dose-rate (HDR) group, in which the dose rate varied from 2.06 to 3.74 Gy/minute. Post-GKS, the patients' pain control was determined using the Barrow Neurological Institute (BNI) pain scale. There was no statistically significant difference between groups with respect to history of prior microvascular decompression (p = 0.410) or peripheral neuroablative procedures (p = 0.583). The length of symptoms in patients varied from 3 to 414 months with a median of 84 months (p = 0.698). Median follow-up was 26 months with a maximum of 139 months., RESULTS: Initial pain relief was obtained in 71% of patients in the LDR group and 78% in the HDR group (p = 0.547). Patients who initially obtained improved pain relief (BNI Scores I-IIIa) after GKS maintained pain control for median durations of 52 months (LDR group) and 54 months (HDR group) (p = 0.403). New or increased facial sensory dysfunction was found in 14.5% of patients in the LDR group and in 19.3% of patients in the HDR group (p = 0.479)., CONCLUSIONS: The authors found that the GKS dose rate did not affect pain control or morbidity within the range of 1.21-3.74 Gy/minute.

2664,"The effect of bone mineral density on proximal junctional failure in thoraco-lumbar fusion INTRODUCTION: Proximal junctional failure can be a catastrophic complication associated with adult spinal deformity surgery. Osteoporosis has been associated with increased risk of proximal failure. Due to regional sclerosis, spinal DEXA (Dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry) scan scores have been reported as flawed and unreliable. Recently, investigators have reported on the use of CT scans as surrogates in place of spinal DEXA scores. The purpose of our study was to investigate if CT based assessments of bone mineral density can predict the possibility of proximal junctional failures. Method(s): Records of spinal deformity patients (n= 26) who had surgeries between 2007- 2012 were retrospectively reviewed from a single academic medical center. All patients included had constructs involving fusions to the pelvis and encompassing at least five lumbar levels. Indications included flat back, positive sagittal balance, and degenerative lumbar scoliosis. All patients had pre-operative standing x-rays and CT scans. Demographic data recorded included age, gender, past medical/ surgical history, diagnosed osteoporosis, and chronic steroid use with patient identifiers removed. The patients were divided into groups with proximal junctional failure (PJF) as either having progression in kyphosis over 10 degrees (proximal junctional kyphosis; PJK) or having a fracture at the proximal level. Three groups were created. Group 1 consisted of patients with no proximal junctional failure (n=16); Group 2 with PJK (n=6); and Group 3 with proximal level fracture (n=4). The CT based bone mineral density (BMD) was calculated by defining a region of interest within the vertebral body in the sagittal plane. Hounsfield units (HU) were measured within this region of interest. The vertebra at the most cranial end of the final construct was defined as the upper instrumented vertebra (UIV). Measurements were made at UIV, UIV + l(proximal), and UIV -l(distal), which is a level above and below the upper instrumented vertebra. Result(s): Statistical analysis was completed using Spss v 18. The comparison between patients with and without proximal junctional failure shows that 10/26 had failure. T5-9 was the most proximal levels for PJF (50%) and without PJF (62.5%). There was no significance comparing mean BMD between Group 1 and 2, but between Group 1 and Group 3, UIV +1 showed significance (p=0.041). The mean proximal kyphosis was 13.8 degrees (10-32 degrees). Of the four patients with proximal level fracture, two involved the vertebral body with implant back out and two had an endplate fracture. SIGNIFICANCE: Bone mineral density measured from a CT scan was an effective tool in planning the proximal extent of fusion in adult deformities. The bone mineral density values of less than 130 HU at the planned upper instrumented vertebra was a risk factor for a proximal junctional fracture. For proximal junctional kyphosis, our study found no statistical significance.",Excluded

Three weeks post-inoculation, the right leg of 12 rats bearing the tumor nodule was treated with BPA-BNCT (BPA-Boronophenylalanine) at the RA-3 nuclear reactor located in Buenos Aires, Argentina, at an absorbed dose of 7.5 Gy to skin as the dose-limiting tissue. The remaining group of 14 tumor-bearing rats were left untreated and used as control. Two weeks post-BNCT, 1 x 106 DHD/K12/TRb cells were injected subcutaneously in the contralateral left hind flank of each of the 26 BDIX rats. Tumor volume in both legs was measured weekly for 7 weeks to determine response to BNCT in the right leg and to assess a potential influence of BNCT in the right leg on tumor development in the left leg. Within the BNCT group, a statistically significant reduction was observed in contralateral left tumor volume in animals whose right leg tumor responded to BNCT (post-treatment/pre-treatment tumor volume <1) versus animals who failed to respond (post/pre >=1), i.e., 13 +/- 15 vs 271 +/- 128 mm3.

However, which techniques give the best results remain unknown. The investigation of a new imaging technique initially requires an analysis of its precision. The primary aim of this study was to investigate the interobserver agreement of high-resolution peripheral quantitative CT (HR-pQCT) in the diagnosis of a scaphoid fracture. A secondary aim was to investigate the interobserver agreement for the presence of other fractures and for the classification of scaphoid fracture. Methods Two radiologists and two orthopaedic trauma surgeons evaluated HR-pQCT scans of 31 patients with a clinically-suspected scaphoid fracture. The observers were asked to determine the presence of a scaphoid or other fracture and to classify the scaphoid fracture based on the Herbert classification system. Fleiss kappa statistics were used to calculate the interobserver agreement for the diagnosis of a fracture. Intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs) were used to assess the agreement for the classification of scaphoid fracture. Results A total of nine (29%) scaphoid fractures and 12 (39%) other fractures were diagnosed in 20 patients (65%) using HR-pQCT across the four observers. The interobserver agreement was 91% for the identification of a scaphoid fracture (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.76 to 1.00) and 80% for other fractures (95% CI 0.72 to 0.87). The mean ICC for the classification of a scaphoid fracture in the seven patients diagnosed with scaphoid fracture by all four observers was 73% (95% CI 0.42 to 0.94).

2444,"Assessment of DNA damage in nuclear medicine personnel--comparative study with the alkaline comet assay and the chromosome aberration test Despite much research over the last few decades, there still remains considerable uncertainty as to the genetic impact of ionizing radiation on human populations, particularly at low levels. The aim of the present study was to provide data on the genetic hazards due to occupational exposure of low doses of ionizing radiation in nuclear medicine departments. The assessment of primary DNA damage in peripheral blood leukocytes of medical staff was performed using the alkaline comet assay and the data obtained were compared with the results of conventional cytogenetic biodosimetry using the chromosome aberration (CA) test. Altogether 120 subjects (60 exposed and 60 controls) participated in the study. Statistically significant increases in primary DNA damage and increased frequencies of CAs compared to controls were observed. Within the exposed population, significant inter-individual differences in DNA damage were found, indicating differences in genome sensitivity. Age and gender were not confounding factors, while smoking enhanced the levels of primary DNA damage only in control subjects, as revealed by both biomarkers studied. The present study suggests that genotoxic damage results from exposure to chronic low doses of ionizing radiation in nuclear medicine departments. Therefore, the exposed medical personnel should carefully comply with the radiation protection procedures and should minimize radiation exposure where possible to avoid potential genotoxic effects. The results obtained in this study point to the significance of biological indicators providing information on the actual risk to the radiation exposed individuals. According to our results, the alkaline comet assay and CA test are sensitive biomarkers that can be used as additional complements to physical dosimetry for assessing exposure to radiation in nuclear medicine personnel.",Included
821,"Sex- and APOE isoform-dependent effects of radiation on cognitive function Clinical irradiation of the brain induces hippocampus-dependent cognitive impairments in some but not all individuals, suggesting the involvement of genetic risk factors. Deficiency of apolipoprotein E (APOE), which is important for the metabolism and redistribution of lipoproteins and cholesterol, increases behavioral impairments after irradiation, supporting a protective role for APOE against radiation-induced cognitive injury. Compared to APOE3, APOE4 increases while APOE2 decreases the risk of developing age-related cognitive decline and Alzheimer's disease, particularly in women. To determine the potential effects of APOE isoform and sex on radiation-induced cognitive impairments, we irradiated 2-month-old male and female APOE2, APOE3 and APOE4 mice and assessed their cognitive performance 3 months later. When hippocampus-dependent spatial learning and memory were assessed in the water maze, sham-irradiated female APOE2, APOE3 and APOE4 and irradiated female APOE2 mice showed spatial memory retention, but irradiated female APOE3 and APOE4 mice did not. Compared to sham-irradiated female APOE4 mice, irradiated female APOE4 mice also required more trials to reach criterion in the hippocampus-dependent passive avoidance test. Radiation had no effects on water maze or passive avoidance learning and memory of male APOE2, APOE3 or APOE4 mice, indicating that the effects of radiation on cognitive performance are dependent on sex- and APOE isoform.",Included
1277,"Effect of combined misonidazole and accelerated neon ions on a human melanoma transplanted into nude mice The response to accelerated neon ions of human Nall melanomas growing in nude mice was measured by an in vitro colony-forming assay following in situ tumor irradiation in the midposition of a 10-cm extended-peak ionization region. Values of the relative biological effectiveness (RBE) for peak neon ions compared with 60Co gamma radiation were 3.2 and 3.4, respectively, at the 1% and 10% survival levels. Following irradiation with peak neon ions, the repair of potentially lethal damage (PLD) was comparable to that observed after gamma irradiation. When misonidazole (1 mg/g intraperitoneal dose) was administered in combination with extended-peak neon ions, the drug enhancement ratio (ER) at the 1% survival level was 1.5 if the tumors were removed and plated in vitro immediately following irradiation, and 1.9 if tumor excision and plating were delayed for greater than 6 hours. Administration of misonidazole completely inhibited PLD repair following either gamma irradiation or extended-peak neon-ion irradiation.",Included
1098,"Patient radiation exposure during diagnostic and therapeutic interventional neuroradiology procedures PURPOSE: Increasing in number and complexity, interventional neuroradiology (INR) procedures are becoming an important source of radiation exposure for patients. In accordance with the ALARA principle, radiation exposure during INR procedures should be curtailed as much as possible while reaching successful treatment outcomes. Moreover, the extent of radiation exposure should be one outcome measure used to assess new technologies and procedural efficacy, and training programs should include techniques for exposure limitation. This study provides a methodology and preliminary data to assess radiation exposure during different INR procedure types., MATERIALS AND METHODS: All patients undergoing endovascular procedures in two biplanar dedicated neuroangiography suites at a major academic medical center were monitored according to procedure type, pathological indication, fluoroscopy time and machine-generated patient dose estimates between April 2006 and July 2008., RESULTS: 1678 patients underwent cerebral arteriography during the study period. Women (62.1%) accounted for the majority of patients, but men (38.9%) were more likely to undergo an interventional procedure than women (32.8%). Diagnostic studies accounted for 64.9% of procedures. Variable exposures were found between diagnostic and interventional procedures. Exposure differed depending on indications for the procedure and procedure type., CONCLUSION: Radiation exposure is an increasingly important consideration in the development of minimally invasive neurological procedures including cerebral angiography and INR. The type of procedure and lesion type allow the practitioner to estimate radiation exposure. Such information informs the clinical decision making process. Normative data should be collected and used for comparison purposes as one measure of technical and procedural success.",Excluded
534,"Post-remission treatment with allogeneic stem cell transplantation in patients aged 60 years and older with acute myeloid leukaemia: A time-dependent analysis Background: Acute myeloid leukaemia mainly affects elderly people, with a median age at diagnosis of around 70 years. Although about 50-60% of patients enter first complete remission upon intensive induction chemotherapy, relapse remains high and overall outcomes are disappointing. Therefore, effective post-remission therapy is urgently needed. Although often no post-remission therapy is given to elderly patients, it might include chemotherapy or allogeneic haemopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) following reduced-intensity conditioning. We aimed to assess the comparative value of allogeneic HSCT with other approaches, including no post-remission therapy, in patients with acute myeloid leukaemia aged 60 years and older. Method(s): For this time-dependent analysis, we used the results from four successive prospective HOVON-SAKK acute myeloid leukaemia trials. Between May 3, 2001, and Feb 5, 2010, a total of 1155 patients aged 60 years and older were entered into these trials, of whom 640 obtained a first complete remission after induction chemotherapy and were included in the analysis. Post-remission therapy consisted of allogeneic HSCT following reduced-intensity conditioning (n=97), gemtuzumab ozogamicin (n=110), chemotherapy (n=44), autologous HSCT (n=23), or no further treatment (n=366). Reduced-intensity conditioning regimens consisted of fludarabine combined with 2 Gy of total body irradiation (n=71), fludarabine with busulfan (n=10), or other regimens (n=16). A time-dependent analysis was done, in which allogeneic HSCT was compared with other types of post-remission therapy. The primary endpoint of the study was 5-year overall survival for all treatment groups, analysed by a time-dependent analysis. Finding(s): 5-year overall survival was 35% (95% CI 25-44) for patients who received an allogeneic HSCT, 21% (17-26) for those who received no additional post-remission therapy, and 26% (19-33) for patients who received either additional chemotherapy or autologous HSCT. Overall survival at 5 years was strongly affected by the European LeukemiaNET acute myeloid leukaemia risk score, with patients in the favourable risk group (n=65) having better 5-year overall survival (56% [95% CI 43-67]) than those with intermediate-risk (n=131; 23% [19-27]) or adverse-risk (n=444; 13% [8-20]) acute myeloid leukaemia. Multivariable analysis with allogeneic HSCT as a time-dependent variable showed that allogeneic HSCT was associated with better 5-year overall survival (HR 0.71 [95% CI 0.53-0.95], p=0.017) compared with non-allogeneic HSCT post-remission therapies or no post-remission therapy, especially in patients with intermediate-risk (0.82 [0.58-1.15]) or adverse-risk (0.39 [0.21-0.73]) acute myeloid leukaemia. Interpretation(s): Collectively, the results from these four trials suggest that allogeneic HSCT might be the preferred treatment approach in patients 60 years of age and older with intermediate-risk and adverse-risk acute myeloid leukaemia in first complete remission, but the comparative value should ideally be shown in a prospective randomised study.

2190,"Can we predict failure of internal fixation when treating femoral neck fractures? At present, femoral head saving surgery is reserved for femoral neck fracture patients who are either young or have suffered a minimally displaced fracture. However, even after this strict selection, an approximate failure rate of internal fixation of 15% is described in the literature. The present study looked if failures can be discerned from successes by baseline differences. Files and X-rays of 164 consecutive femoral neck fracture patients treated by internal fixation in our hospital between 1996 and 2002 were studied, retrospectively. Successfully treated patients and failures (defined as the need for an arthroplasty following internal fixation) were compared with regard to patient's age, pretraumatic mobility, fracture dislocation, fracture angle, operative delay, operative duration and experience of the surgeon. Of the 164 patients undergoing internal fixation for a femoral neck fracture, 16 were classified as failures (10%) and 148 were treated successfully. There was no statistical difference between groups with regard to any of the studied variables. Patients in whom internal fixation of femoral neck fractures fails, cannot be discerned from successfully treated patients by preoperative variables. © 2006 Springer-Verlag.",Excluded
1587,"Radiofrequency ablation is beneficial in simultaneous treatment of synchronous liver metastases and primary colorectal cancer Background: In patients with resectable synchronous colorectal liver metastases (CRLM), either twostaged or simultaneous resections of the primary tumor and liver metastases are performed. Data on radiofrequency ablation (RFA) for the treatment of CRLM during a simultaneous procedure is lacking. The primary aim was to analyze short-term and long-term outcome of RFA in simultaneous treatment. A secondary aim was to compare simultaneous resection with the colorectal-first approach. Method(s): Retrospective analysis of 241 patients with colorectal cancer and synchronous CRLM between 2000-2016. Median follow-up was 36.1 months (IQR 18.2-58.8 months). A multivariable analysis was performed to analyze the postoperative morbidity, using the comprehensive complication index. A propensity matched analysis was performed to compare survival rates. Result(s): In multivariable analysis, the best predictor of lower complication severity was treatment with RFA (p = 0.040). Higher complication rates were encountered in patients who underwent an abdominoperineal resection (p = 0.027) or age > 60 years (p = 0.022). The matched analysis showed comparable overall survival in RFA treated patients versus patients undergoing a liver resection with a five year overall survival of 39.4% and 37.5%, respectively (p = 0.782). In a second matched analysis, 5-year overall survival rates in simultaneously treated patients (43.8%) was comparable to patients undergoing the colorectal first approach (43.0%, p = 0.223). Conclusion(s): RFA treatment of CRLM in simultaneous procedures is associated with a lower complication severity and non-inferior oncological outcome as compared to partial liver resection. RFA should be considered a useful alternative to liver resection.Copyright © 2018 Hof et al.

1803,"Results of adjuvant radiochemotherapy for gastric adenocarcinoma in Slovenia Aims: To analyze the results of postoperative concomitant radiochemotherapy with 5-florouracil (5-FU) and leucovorin (LV) in patients with gastric carcinoma treated in a single institution. Method(s): During 2001-2004, 123 patients with the mean age of 60 years, were treated for adenocarcinoma of the stomach, stage Ib-IV, with postoperative concomitant radiochemotherapy. Radical (R0) and non-radical (R1) resection of the tumor was performed in 107 and 16 patients, respectively. Adjuvant treatment consisted of five cycles of five-day chemotherapy with 5-FU (425 mg/m2) and LV (20 mg/m2) and concomitant radiotherapy with the total dose of 45 Gy. Result(s): The treatment was completed according to the protocol in 101 patients. Stomatitis, dysphagia, and nausea and vomiting of grade three occurred in 32, 27, and 23 patients, respectively. The median follow-up time of 87 survivors was 30.4 months (range 17.4-58.3 months). At two years, locoregional control (LRC), disease-free survival (DFS), disease-specific survival (DSS) and overall survival (OS) rates were 86%, 65%, 74%, and 73%, respectively. In the multivariate analysis, the initial Hb level was identified as independent prognostic factor for all survival four endpoints, the involvement of whole stomach with cancer for LRC, the total dose of 5-FU per five-day cycle for DFS, and pT stage for DSS. Conclusion(s): In operable gastric carcinoma, postoperative concomitant radiochemotherapy with 5-FU and LV is feasible and its toxicity acceptable. Its potential to improve the treatment outcome compared to the surgery alone is yet to be tested in well designed prospective randomized studies. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",Excluded
2685,"Thigh Ultrasound Used to Identify Frail Elderly Patients with Sarcopenia Undergoing Surgery: A Pilot Study BACKGROUND: Computed tomography (CT) scan quantifying skeletal muscle mass is the gold standard tool to identify sarcopenia. Unfortunately, high cost, limited availability, and radiation exposure limit its use. We suggest that ultrasound of the thigh muscle could be an objective, reproducible, portable, and risk-free tool, used as a surrogate to a CT scan, to help identify frail patients with sarcopenia., MATERIALS AND METHODS: We included 49 patients over 64 y old, referred to the acute care surgery service. An ultrasound of thigh muscle thickness was standardized to patient thigh length (U/Swhole/L). CT skeletal muscle index (SMI) was calculated using skeletal muscle surface area of the L3 region divided by height2. Frailty status was assessed using the Canadian Study of Healthy Aging Clinical Frailty Scale., RESULTS: The mean (SD) age was 76 (8) y, and 34% (n = 17) were men. CT-defined sarcopenia was identified in 65% (n = 11) of men and 75% (n = 24) of women. In general, women had longer stay in hospital than men (mean + SD 14 +/- 9 versus 7 +/- 3 d, P = 0.003). There was a significant positive correlation between thigh U/Swhole/L and CT SMI. There was an inverse correlation between thigh U/Swhole/L and frailty score; a similar relationship was observed between CT SMI and frailty. There was an association between U/Swhole/L and postoperative major complications., CONCLUSIONS: This prospective observational study illustrates that the U/Swhole/L index can be used as a surrogate to CT scan, whereby it can identify elderly frail patients with sarcopenia. Thigh ultrasound should be further tested as an objective tool to assess for stratifying frailty. Copyright © 2020 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.",Excluded
356,"Increased circulating cell-free DNA levels and mtDNA fragments in interventional cardiologists occupationally exposed to low levels of ionizing radiation Circulating cell-free DNA (ccf-DNA) and mtDNA (ccf-mtDNA) have often been used as indicators of cell death and tissue damage in acute and chronic disorders, but little is known about changes in ccf-DNA and ccf-mtDNA concentrations following radiation exposure. The aim of the study was to investigate the impact of chronic low-dose radiation exposure on serum ccf-DNA levels and ccf-mtDNA fragments (mtDNA-79 and mtDNA-230) of interventional cardiologists working in high-volume cardiac catheterization laboratory to assess their possible role as useful radiation biomarkers. We enrolled 50 interventional cardiologists (26 males; age = 48.4 +/- 10 years) and 50 age- and gender-matched unexposed controls (27 males; age = 47.6 +/- 8.3 years). Quant-iT TM dsDNA High-Sensitivity assay was used to measure circulating ccf-DNA isolated from serum samples. Quantitative analysis of mtDNA fragments was performed by real-time PCR. No significant relationships were found between ccf-DNA and ccf-mtDNA, and age, gender, smoking, or other clinical parameters. Ccf-DNA levels (44.2 +/- 31.1 vs. 30.6 +/- 19.2 ng/ml, P = 0.013), ccf-mtDNA-79 (2.6 +/- 2.1 vs. 1.1 +/- 0.8, P < 0.01), and ccf-mtDNA-230 copies (2.0 +/- 1.8 vs. 1.04 +/- 0.9, P = 0.02) were significantly higher in interventional cardiologists compared with the non-exposed group. In a subset (n = 15) of interventional cardiologists with a reliable reconstruction of cumulative professional exposure (59.7 +/- 48.4 mSv; range: 1.4-182 mS), ccf-DNA (53.2 +/- 41.3 vs. 36.4 +/- 22.9 and 32.2 +/- 20.5, P = 0.08), mtDNA-79 (2.4 +/- 2.1 vs. 2.03 +/- 1.7 and 1.09 +/- 0.82, P = 0.05), and mtDNA-230 (2.0 +/- 2.2 vs. 1.5 +/- 1.4 and 1.04 +/- 0.9, P = 0.09) tended to be significantly increased in high-exposure subjects compared with both low-exposure interventional cardiologists and controls. Our results provide evidence for a possible role of circulating DNA as a relevant biomarker of cellular damage induced by exposure to chronic low-dose radiation.

3492,"Role of Angiogenesis in Chronic Radiation Proctitis: New Evidence Favoring Inhibition of Angiogenesis Ex Vivo Background: Chronic radiation proctitis (CRP), a common complication after radiotherapy for pelvic malignancies, compromises patient quality of life. Vascular damage and aberrant angiogenesis in the mucosal layer are essential histological features, but changes to the submucosal layer are unclear. Thus, we evaluated the histological characteristics and distribution changes of key angiogenic factors in full-layered human CRP samples. Method(s): Thirty paraffin-embedded CRP and twenty-nine non-CRP tissues were used to evaluate histopathological changes. Immunohistochemistry with anti-CD34 antibody was performed to calculate microvascular density (MVD). Frozen tissues from eight CRP patients and five non-CRP controls were collected and analyzed by antibody array, which contained sixty human angiogenesis-related factors. Quality controls with positive and negative controls were performed during antibody array analysis. Two differentially expressed factors were confirmed by ELISA. Result(s): CRP lesions showed vasculopathy, fibrosis, mucosal ulceration, edema, and inflammatory cell infiltration. Human angiogenesis antibody array and ELISA confirmed the increased angiostatin in CRP lesions. Immunohistochemical staining showed dispersed distribution of angiostatin throughout the mucosal and submucosal layers in CRP lesions, while angiostatin accumulated within the vessel lumens in non-CRP tissues. MVD significantly decreased in the submucosal layer of CRP, suggesting a potential association with increased angiostatin. Conclusion(s): Angiostatin increased and had a distinct distribution in CRP lesions. Compensatory telangiectasia in the mucosa, vessel stenosis, and reduced MVD might attenuate blood flow in the submucosa and contribute to CRP progression. Restoration of vascular functionality by promoting angiogenesis in the submucosal layer may help alleviate CRP in clinical practice.Copyright © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.",Excluded
372,"Low-dose MDCT and CT enterography of patients with crohn disease: Feasibility of adaptive statistical iterative reconstruction OBJECTIVE. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the image quality and diagnostic performance of low-dose MDCT and CT enterography with adaptive statistical iterative reconstruction (ASIR) in the evaluation of Crohn disease. SUBJECTS AND METHODS. Forty-eight patients (20 men, 28 women; mean age, 33.3 years; range, 17-83 years) with known or suspected Crohn disease who underwent low-dose MDCT and CT enterography with ASIR between December 2008 and December 2009 were included in the study. Twenty-seven patients had previously undergone standard-dose 64-MDCT and CT enterography with filtered back projection (FBP), and those images were used for comparison. The weight-based IV contrast protocol and scan parameters (120 kVp, 5-mm section thickness, 0.5-second rotation, pitch of 1.375, 64 x 0.625 mm detector configuration) were constant for the two techniques except for a higher noise index (x1.3) in the ASIR group. Two blinded readers reviewed 75 randomized MDCT-CT enterographic scans of 48 patients to assess image quality and diagnostic performance in the evaluation of Crohn disease, and the radiation dose for the studies was estimated. RESULTS. All 75 MDCT and CT enterographic scans had acceptable quality for diagnostic interpretation. Findings of Crohn disease were seen on 63 of 75 scans (84%). Low-dose scans in the ASIR group had optimal image quality and were rated comparable to or better than standard-dose FBP images (mean score, 4.2 vs 3.87; p = 0.007). The subjective image noise score (mean, 1.43 vs 1.58; p = 0.2) and objective image noise measurements were lower for ASIR images (p < 0.001). Low-dose studies with ASIR allowed average dose reduction of 34.5% compared with standard-dose scans with FBP (volume CT dose index for ASIR, 7.7 +/- 2.1 mGy; for FBP, 12 +/- 5.5 mGy; p < 0.01). CONCLUSION. Low-dose MDCT and CT enterographic studies reconstructed with ASIR were of appropriate quality for confident evaluation of the manifestations of Crohn disease while allowing approximately 34% dose reduction in comparison with FBP technique. © American Roentgen Ray Society.",Excluded
3501,"Ultraviolet B enhances DNA hypomethylation of CD4+ T cells in systemic lupus erythematosus via inhibiting DNMT1 catalytic activity Background: CD4+ T cells DNA hypomethylation is involved in the pathogenesis of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). Recent studies showed that ultraviolet B (UVB, 290-320. nm) might induce the exacerbation of SLE by decreasing the DNA methylation level. However, the role of DNA methyltransferase 1 (DNMT1) in the UVB-induced CD4+ T cells DNA hypomethylation remains unclear. Objective(s): To elucidate the role of DNMT1 in lupus CD4+ T cells global DNA hypomethylation enhanced by UVB. Method(s): 35 SLE patients and 15 healthy controls were enrolled in the study. CD4+ T cells from SLE patients and healthy controls exposed to different dosages of UVB were analyzed. The global DNA methylation measurement, real-time PCR, Western blotting and DNMT1 catalytic activity detection were employed. Result(s): The level of global DNA methylation and DNMT1 mRNA expression in CD4+ T cells from SLE patients were significantly lower than those from the control group. DNA methylation was decreased after UVB exposure in a dosage-dependent manner in SLE patients, but not in the control group. DNMT1 mRNA and protein expression level were not affected by UVB exposure in both SLE patients and healthy controls. DNMT1 catalytic activity was significantly decreased in CD4+ T cells from SLE patients after UVB exposure in a dosage-dependent manner. DNMT1 catalytic activity was lower and more sensitive to UVB exposure in CD4+ T cells from active SLE patients that from stable ones.

Patients were randomized to 80-kVp imaging (n = 103) or 100-kVp imaging (n = 105). Three blinded readers graded interpretability and image quality. Study signal, noise, and contrast were also compared., RESULTS: Imaging with 80 kVp instead of 100 kVp was associated with 47% lower median radiation dose (median dose-length product, 62.0 mGy . cm [interquartile range, 54.0-123.3 mGy . cm] vs 117.0 mGy . cm [110.0-225.9 mGy . cm], respectively; 0.9 mSv [0.8-1.7 mSv] vs 1.6 mSv [1.4-3.2 mSv]; p < 0.001 for each) with no significant difference in interpretability (99% vs 99%; p = 0.99) or image quality (median score, 4.0 [interquartile range, 3.6-4.0] vs 4.0 [interquartile range, 3.8-4.0]; p = 0.20). Studies obtained using 80 kVp were associated with 27% increased signal (mean +/- SD, 756 +/- 157 vs 594 +/- 105 HU; p < 0.001), 25% higher contrast (890 +/- 156 vs 709 +/- 108 HU; p < 0.001), and 50% greater noise (55 +/- 15 vs 37 +/- 12 HU; p < 0.001) with resultant 15% and 16% decreases in signal-to-noise (mean +/- SD, 15 +/- 5 vs 17 +/- 5; p < 0.001) and contrast-to-noise (mean +/- SD, 17 +/- 6 vs 21 +/- 5; p < 0.001) ratios, respectively., CONCLUSION: Coronary CTA using 80 kVp instead of 100 kVp was associated with a nearly 50% reduction in radiation dose with no significant difference in interpretability and noninferior image quality despite lower signal-to-noise and contrast-to-noise ratios. The use of 80-kVp tube voltage should be considered in dose-reduction strategies for coronary CTA of individuals with a normal BMI.",Excluded
3159,"UVB induces epidermal 11beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 1 activity in vivo Detrimental consequences of ultraviolet radiation (UVR) in skin include photoageing, immunosuppression and photocarcinogenesis, processes also significantly regulated by local glucocorticoid (GC) availability. In man, the enzyme 11beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 1 (11beta-HSD1) generates the active GC cortisol from cortisone (or corticosterone from 11-dehydrocorticosterone in rodents). 11beta-HSD1 oxo-reductase activity requires the cofactor NADPH, generated by hexose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase. We previously demonstrated increased 11beta-HSD1 levels in skin obtained from photoexposed versus photoprotected anatomical regions. However, the direct effect of UVR on 11beta-HSD1 expression remains to be elucidated. To investigate the cutaneous regulation of 11beta-HSD1 following UVR in vivo, the dorsal skin of female SKH1 mice was irradiated with 50, 100, 200 and 400 mJ/cm2 UVB. Measurement of transepidermal water loss, 11beta-HSD1 activity, mRNA/protein expression and histological studies was taken at 1, 3 and 7 days postexposure. 11beta-HSD1 and hexose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase mRNA expression peaked 1 day postexposure to 400 mJ/cm2 UVB before subsequently declining (days 3 and 7). Corresponding increases in 11beta-HSD1 protein and enzyme activity were observed 3 days postexposure coinciding with reduced GC receptor mRNA expression. Immunofluorescence studies revealed 11beta-HSD1 localization to hyperproliferative epidermal keratinocytes in UVB-exposed skin. 11beta-HSD1 expression and activity were also induced by 200 and 100 (but not 50) mJ/cm2 UVB and correlated with increased transepidermal water loss (indicative of barrier disruption). UVB-induced 11beta-HSD1 activation represents a novel mechanism that may contribute to the regulation of cutaneous responses to UVR exposure.Copyright © 2015 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

455,"Oxidative stress and low dose ionizing radiation The field of radiation biochemistry has provided tremendous impact in recent years as extensive research on free radicals has implicated them in radiation damage. An important offshoot of this field is the branch dealing with radiological protection in medical applications like diagnostic radiology. Hence, we decided to investigate the relationship between oxidative stress and low dose ionizing radiation (x-rays) in the work environment of x-ray technicians (radiographers), by comparing their RBC malondialdehyde, % hemolysis, catalase and plasma vitamin E levels with those of controls. There was a significant increase in the susceptibility of RBCs to hemolysis in radiographers compared to controls. Malondialdehyde and catalase levels were slightly increased in the radiographers, but this did not disturb the steady state concentration of their plasma vitamin E. These findings go in favour of theories stating that exposure to low dose ionizing radiation does cause a greater amount of oxidative stress, than that caused during normal routine metabolic processes.",Included

In addition, five males and five females were treated in a similar fashion, but were exposed to sham conditions. For each subject, a blood sample was obtained prior to the exposure period and aliquots were used as negative- (pre-exposure) and positive- [1.5 Gray (Gy) (60)Cobalt ((60)Co) gamma-irradiation] controls. At the end of the 4 h exposure period, a second blood sample was obtained. The extent of DNA damage was assessed in peripheral human blood leukocytes from all samples using the alkaline comet assay. To detect possible clastogenic effects, the incidence of micronuclei was assessed in phytohemagglutinin (PHA)-stimulated lymphocytes using the cytokinesis-block micronucleus assay., RESULTS: There was no evidence of either increased DNA damage, as indicated by the alkaline comet assay, or increased incidence of micronuclei (MN) in the magnetic field exposed group. However, an in vitro exposure of 1.5 Gy gamma-irradiation caused a significant increase in both DNA damage and MN induction., CONCLUSIONS: This study found no evidence that an acute, whole-body exposure to a 200 microT, 60 Hz magnetic field for 4 hours could cause DNA damage in human blood.",Excluded
1062,"Computed tomography in patients with abdominal pain and diarrhoea: Does the benefit outweigh the drawbacks? The role of computed tomography (CT) in the evaluation of abdominal pain is well established. However, concern exists in regard to procedure-related radiation levels, contrast-medium toxicity and costs. We sought to determine whether the use of abdominal CT caused major changes in the management of patients who had abdominal pain and diarrhoea. We reviewed all abdominal CT examinations that were performed at our hospital from October through December 2010. We selected 574 scans that had been performed in patients who presented with or without diarrhoea. We examined the selected medical records to determine whether the CT scan changed patients' management. A scan was considered to be management changing if a decisive intervention occurred on the basis of the scan results. Among 124 scans in patients with diarrhoea and 450 scans in patients without diarrhoea, the scan results changed management in 13 of the patients with diarrhoea (11%) and in 233 of those without diarrhoea (52%) (P<0.001). When management changed, the changes resulted from findings unrelated to diarrhoea. Despite its defined role in the assessment of abdominal pain, CT of patients that also had diarrhoea seldom caused a major change in management. The probability of CT causing such a change does not outweigh the cost, radiation risk or potential for contrast-induced nephropathy. © 2013 Royal Australasian College of Physicians.",Excluded
2278,"Increased susceptibility to ionizing radiation in mice with ST6Gal-1 deficiency Sporadic reports have associated the degree of N-linked alpha2,6 sialylation, mediated by the sialyltransferase ST6Gal-1, with increased chemo-and radio-resistance of tumor cells, therapeutic failures in colorectal cancers, and protection against Fas-mediated apoptosis. Radiation exposure, whether iatrogenic or accidental, is a significant health concern. ST6Gal-1 has been suggested as a candidate biomarker for exposure to ionizing radiation; both enzyme expression and the level of protein sialylation increase following radiation exposure in a dose dependent manner. Here we report a striking sensitivity of animals with non-functional ST6Gal-1 to ionizing radiation. We attempted to rescue st6gal1-KO and wild-type C57BL/6J mice that were subjected to 12 Gy full body irradiation by bone marrow transplantation with congenic wild-type marrow cells. While the wild-type, st6gal1-normal animals uniformly survived the procedure, st6gal1-KO mice suffered 100% morbidity within 8 days of irradiation. There was comparable homing and retention of donor cells to the marrow of st6gal1-KO and wild-type recipients, and failure of hematopoietic cell engraftment was unlikely as a cause for morbidity. However, st6gal1-KO recipients suffered heavy damage to the gastrointestinal tract resulting in an almost complete loss of absorptive tissue and integrity of the gastrointestinal architecture. This damage was far less severe in the wild-type recipients. Damage to the gastrointestinal tract is an especially frequent and detrimental complication of radiation used in cancer therapy. Our data indicate a critical role for ST6Gal-1 in the maintenance of radioresistance in the gastrointestinal tract.",Included
3003,"Radiation dose values for various coronary calcium scoring protocols in dual-source CT PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to assess the radiation dose and associated image noise of previously suggested calcium scoring protocols using dual-source CT., METHODS: One hundred consecutive patients underwent coronary calcium scoring using dual-source CT. Patients were randomly assigned to five different protocols: retrospective ECG-gating and tube current reduction to 4% outside the pulsing window at 120 (protocol A) and 100 kV (B), prospective ECG-triggering at 120 (C) and 100 kV (D), and prospective ECG-triggering at 100 kV with attenuation-based tube current modulation (E). Radiation dose parameters and image noise were determined and compared., RESULTS: Protocol A resulted in an effective dose of 1.3 +/- 0.2 mSv, protocol B in 0.8 +/- 0.2 mSv, protocol C in 1.0 +/- 0.2 mSv, protocol D in 0.6 +/- 0.1 mSv, and protocol E in 0.7 +/- 0.1 mSv. Effective doses were significantly lower (P < 0.001) with 100 kV when compared to 120 kV protocols, and were significantly lower (P < 0.001) for prospective versus retrospective ECG-gating. No significant difference was found between protocol D and E. Significant negative correlations were found between the CTDI(vol) and heart rate for both retrospective ECG-gating protocols (protocol A: r = -0.98, P < 0.001; protocol B: r = -0.83, P < 0.001). The mean image noise was 29.0 +/- 6.7 HU, with no significant differences between the five protocols. The image noise was significantly correlated with the body weight (r = 0.21, P < 0.05) and BMI (r = 0.31, P < 0.01)., CONCLUSIONS: Effective dose of calcium scoring using dual-source CT ranges from 0.6 to 1.3 mSv. Prospective triggering and lower tube voltage significantly reduces the radiation but yield similar image noise.",Excluded
3298,"Radioadaptive response in human lymphocytes in vitro Exposure to low doses of radiation and/or chemicals can prime an organism to withstand the stress of a subsequent exposure to higher doses of the same agent. In the case of radiation, this phenomenon has been called radioadaptive response. Cytogenetic studies have been undertaken in human lymphocytes to investigate adaptive response (AR) to ionizing radiation, in particular to seek the role of variables such as priming dose, cell cycle stage, and age and gender of the donor. We demonstrated that pre-exposure of lymphocytes in whole blood cultures to very low doses in the range of about 1 cGy (priming or adaptive dose [AD]) reduced the frequency of micronuclei in binucleated cells induced by 100 cGy - that is, produced an AR in these cells in vitro. However, pre-exposure of cells to 10.0 cGy did not reduce the chromosomal damage (micronuclei) induced by the challenging dose (CD) of 100 cGy under the same protocol, thus exhibiting an inverse dose-response relationship. There was marked variability in the AR among the individuals investigated in the study. The extent of AR also depended on the stage of cell cycle exposed to the CD of radiation. Maximum AR was observed when CD of 100 cGy was given 4 hours after AD, 30 hours following the mitogenic stimulation of lymphocytes. The least AR was observed when CD was given 48 hours after stimulation. Interestingly, AR was also found to be dependent on the age of the donor, a decrease in AR being observed with an increasing age. No significant difference in AR was observed between male and female donors. To understand the molecular events underlying AR, protein synthesis patterns were studied in human lymphocytes subjected to mitogen, heat, or radiation stress. Heat shock (45 degreeC, for 15 min) induced 7 proteins with molecular weights ranging from 40 to 80 kDa, while treatment with phytohemagglutinin (40 mug/ mL) showed induction of 2 proteins of molecular weights 38 and 48 kDa, respectively. However, exposure of human lymphocyte cultures to gamma radiation did not significantly induce synthesis of any protein, up to 800 cGy dose. Lack of induction of proteins by gamma radiation in human lymphocytes contrasts with the previous reports showing X-ray radiation-enhanced gene expression in melanoma cells and/or human tumor fibroblasts.",Included
750,"Systematic effects of surgical treatment of hip fractures: gliding screw-plating vs intramedullary nailing AIM: Numerous studies have been published regarding the comparison between intramedullary nail and the dynamic hip screw and plate for the fixation of intertrochanteric fractures in elderly patients. In this paper we present a comparative study of these two methods regarding their systemic effects on this group of patients., MATERIALS-METHODS: This is a randomized trial of 120 consecutive patients with an intertrochanteric fracture treated with either extramedullary fixation (dynamic hip screw and plate; DHS, Synthes-Stratec, Oberdorf, Switzerland) or intramedullary nail (Gamma nail, Stryker Howmedica, Freiburg, Germany and Endovis BA, Citieffe, Bologna, Italy). The parameters that we assessed pre-operatively, in addition to their demographics, included their mental state (MMSE), their nutritional and immune state and their pulmonary function. Intra-operatively we calculated the amount of radiation exposure, the amount of blood loss and the length of operative time for each procedure. Postoperatively we repeated the calculation of the mental and pulmonary state and the blood loss, during days 1, 3, and 10 and related them to the ease of the patient's mobilization., RESULTS: Decreased bleeding and post-operative pain, reduced post-operative morbidity and faster recovery of function were better but not significant in the group of intramedullary fixation (all p>0.05). However, in the same group there were slightly more patients in whom the MMSE was falling, together with their pulmonary function, suggesting that this method probably predisposes to higher chances of pulmonary dysfunction and the possibility of pulmonary embolism., CONCLUSION: We found no significant differences between the two methods of stabilization of these fractures regarding their systemic effects perioperatively. The classic dynamic hip screw can preserve its position as a safe and effective solution for these already vulnerable patients having sustained a trochanteric fracture against the novel intramedullary techniques.

312,"Characteristics of photopheresis treatments for the management of rejection in heart and lung transplant recipients Photopheresis has been used in the management of rejection of heart and/or lung transplants. Although its mechanism of action remains unknown, irradiated T-helper cell-induced immunosuppression is the main theory. Since transplant recipients are often lymphopenic and lymphocytes are the target cells in photo-therapy, we performed this study to determine which factors affect the cellular yield to undergo irradiation. We reviewed the records of all photophereses performed in our institution between July 1998 and April 2000 using the UVAR (first generation) or XTS (second generation) instruments (Therakos, Exton, PA). Our data included patient's blood volume, absolute lymphocyte count and hematocrit, catheter type, flow rate of collection cycles and centrifuge bowl size, as well as volume, hematocrit, and lymphocyte count of the cell suspension. With a mixed model multivariate analysis we sought to determine which variables predicted the lymphocyte yield. A total of 406 procedures in 25 adult patients was analyzed. There was no significant difference between the lymphocyte yield among the procedures performed with the first- and the second-generation instruments. The patient's absolute lymphocyte count was the only parameter, which positively correlated with the total number of lymphocytes collected for irradiation (P < 0.0001). Indeed, based on the mixed model, the total number of lymphocytes for irradiation can be predicted from the pre-procedure lymphocyte count. Additional studies are necessary to correlate the number of treated cells with patient outcome. © 2002 Wiley-Liss, Inc.",Excluded

Between March 2008 and August 2009, 10 patients were treated with SRT boost using CyberKnife system due mainly to unfavorable condition such as tumors in close proximity to serial organs or former radiotherapy fields. Treatment sites were the external auditory canal in two, the nasopharynx in one, the oropharynx in three, the nasal cavity in one, the maxillary sinus in two, and the oligometastatic cervical lymph node in one. All patients underwent preceding conventional radiotherapy of 40 to 60 Gy. Dose and fractionation scheme of the Cyberknife SRT boost was individualized, and prescribed dose ranged from 9 Gy to 16 Gy in 3 to 4 fractions. Among four patients for whom dose to the optic pathway was concerned, the maximum dose was only about 3 Gy for three patients whereas 9.6 Gy in the remaining one patient. The maximum dose for the mandible in one of three patients with oropharyngeal cancer was 19.7 Gy, whereas majority of the bone can be spared by using non-isocentric conformal beams. For a patient with nasopharyngeal cancer, the highest dose in the brain stem was 15 Gy. However, majority of the brain stem received less than 40% of the maximum dose. Although a small volume high dose area within the normal structure could be observed in several patients, results of the present study showed potential benefits of the CyberKnife SRT boost.",Excluded

Radiation exposure of radiologists' left and right hands during 44 percutaneous drainages involving fluoroscopy was measured with thermoluminescent dosimeters. Finger doses of 3.4-1,300 microGy (mean 180, median 110) were recorded. Finger exposure seemed to show a significant, positive correlation with the screening time, but not with the patients' body mass indexes or ages. The mean personal doses of the radiologists were different and, in one case, the difference between the individual radiologists' doses was statistically significant. The personal working technique may therefore partly explain the amount of radiation exposure to the fingers.",Excluded
2880,"Subfoveal choroidal thickness and foveal retinal thickness during head-down tilt Introduction: To reveal subtle morphological changes in the eye during simulated microgravity for spaceflights, we measured subfoveal choroidal thickness and foveal retinal thickness during 10degree head-down tilt (HDT). We hypothesized that elevated ophthalmic vein pressure during simulated microgravity increases subfoveal choroidal thickness via enlargement of the choroidal vasculature and greater choroidal blood volume. Method(s): The right eyes of nine healthy subjects (seven men, two women) were examined. Subfoveal choroidal thickness and foveal retinal thickness were measured using spectral domain-optical coherence tomography in the sitting position, and after 15 and 30 min of 10degree HDT. Intraocular pressure was also measured. Result(s): Mean subfoveal choroidal thickness (+/- SEM) increased from 300 +/- 31 mum in the sitting position to 315 +/- 31 mum with 15-min HDT, and 333 +/- 31 mum with 30-min HDT. However, no change in foveal retinal thickness was observed (228 +/- 9 mum in the sitting position, 228 +/- 10 mum with 15-min HDT and 228 +/- 9 mum with 30-min HDT). Intraocular pressure increased from 14 +/- 1 mmHg in the sitting position to 21 +/- 2 mmHg with 30-min HDT (54 +/- 6%, N = 5).

132,"Stereotactic radiosurgery for intractable cluster headache: An initial report from the North American Gamma Knife Consortium: Clinical article Object. The aim of this study was to evaluate the outcomes of Gamma Knife surgery (GKS) when used for patients with intractable cluster headache (CH). Methods. Four participating centers of the North American Gamma Knife Consortium identified 17 patients who underwent GKS for intractable CH between 1996 and 2008. The median patient age was 47 years (range 26-83 years). The median duration of pain before GKS was 10 years (range 1.3-40 years). Seven patients underwent unsuccessful prior surgical procedures, including microvascular decompression (2 patients), microvascular decompression with glycerol rhizotomy (2 patients), deep brain stimulation (1 patient), trigeminal ganglion stimulation (1 patient), and prior GKS (1 patient). Fourteen patients had associated autonomic symptoms. The radiosurgical target was the trigeminal nerve (TN) root and the sphenopalatine ganglion (SPG) in 8 patients, only the TN in 8 patients, and only the SPG in 1 patient. The median maximum TN and SPG dose was 80 Gy. Results. Favorable pain relief (Barrow Neurological Institute Grades I-IIIb) was achieved and maintained in 10 (59%) of 17 patients at a median follow-up of 34 months. Three patients required additional procedures (repeat GKS in 2 patients, hypothalamic deep brain stimulation in 1 patient). Eight (50%) of 16 patients who had their TN irradiated developed facial sensory dysfunction after GKS. Conclusions. Gamma Knife surgery for intractable, medically refractory CH provided lasting pain reduction in approximately 60% of patients, but was associated with a significantly greater chance of facial sensory disturbances than GKS used for trigeminal neuralgia.",Excluded
42,"Back-scattered electron imaging and elemental analysis of retrieved bone tissue following sinus augmentation with deproteinized bovine bone or biphasic calcium phosphate OBJECTIVES: To compare resorption of a synthetic biphasic calcium phosphate (BCP) bone-graft substitute with deproteinized bovine bone (DBB) used for human maxillary sinus augmentation., MATERIALS AND METHODS: Eleven patients underwent bilateral maxillary sinus floor augmentation with DBB in one side and a BCP (40%beta-tricalcium phosphate (beta-TCP) and 60% hydroxyapatite) in the contralateral side. Simultaneously, with the augmentation on each side a microimplant was placed vertically from the top of the alveolar crest penetrating the residual bone and the grafting material. Eight months after initial surgery the microimplants were retrieved with a surrounding bone core. The composition of residual graft material and surrounding bone was analysed by scanning electron microscopy and energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy., RESULTS: Residual graft material of both types was present as 10-500 mum particles in direct contact with, or completely surrounded by, newly formed bone; smaller particles were also present in non-mineralized tissue. In the case of BCP the bone-graft substitute interface showed evidence of superficial disintegration of particles into individual grains. Median Ca/P ratios (at.%), determined from >200 discreet sites within residual graft particles and adjacent bone, were: DBB: 1.61 (confidence interval [CI] 1.59-1.64); BCP: 1.5 (CI 1.45-1.52); DBB-augmented bone: 1.62 (CI 1.59-1.66); BCP-augmented bone: 1.52 (CI 1.47-1.55); P=0.028 for DBB vs. BCP and DBB- vs. BCP-augmented bone. The reduction in Ca/P ratio for BCP over the healing period is consistent with the dissolution of beta-TCP and reprecipitation on the surface of calcium-deficient hydroxyapatite., CONCLUSION: The beta-TCP component of BCP may be gradually substituted by calcium-deficient hydroxyapatite over the healing period. This process and superficial degranulation of BCP particles may influence the progress of resorption and healing.",Excluded

Best known are the effects of UVB (290-320 nm) and UVA2 (320-340 nm), which cause DNA damage and increased risk of cancer. However, the effects of UVA1 (340-400 nm) have been not completely investigated. Method(s): The effects of repetitive low doses of UVA1 and visible light were studied in 12 healthy individuals. A part of the buttock was exposed to 20 J/cm2 UVA1 and another part to 126 J/cm2 of visible light three times a week for 4 weeks. Repeated punch biopsies were taken during the 4 weeks of treatment and also 2 weeks after the last irradiation. The avidin-biotin-immunoperoxidase technique was used to investigate the expression of p53, p21WAF, bcl-2, Ki67 and cyclin A. Result(s): By comparison to untreated skin, an increased expression of p53 but not p21WAF in keratinocytes was seen. The bcl-2 protein expression increased slightly after both UVA1 and visible light. An increased staining with Ki67 and cyclin A after UVA1 but not after visible light was observed as a sign of increased proliferation. Conclusion(s): These results suggest that suberythemal doses of UVA1 and even visible light may cause DNA damage.",Excluded

To evaluate the maintenance of T-cell memory within A-bomb survivors 60 years after radiation exposure, we examined functionally distinct memory CD4 T-cell subsets in the peripheral blood lymphocytes of the survivors., METHODS: Three functionally different subsets of memory CD4 T cells were identified by differential CD43 expression levels and measured using flow cytometry. These subsets consist of functionally mature memory cells, cells weakly responsive to antigenic stimulation, and those cells functionally anergic and prone to spontaneous apoptosis., RESULTS: The percentages of these subsets within the peripheral blood CD4 T-cell pool all significantly increased with age. Percentages of functionally weak and anergic subsets were also found to increase with radiation dose, fitting to a log linear model. Within the memory CD4 T-cell pool, however, there was an inverse association between radiation dose and the percentage of functionally mature memory cells., CONCLUSION: These results suggest that the steady state of T cell memory, which is regulated by cell activation and/or cell survival processes in subsets, may have been perturbed by prior radiation exposure among A-bomb survivors.",Included
456,"Effective surgical adjuvant therapy for high-risk rectal carcinoma BACKGROUND: Radiation therapy as an adjunct to surgery for rectal cancer has been shown to reduce local recurrence but has not improved survival. In a previous study, combined radiation and chemotherapy improved survival significantly as compared with surgery alone, but not as compared with adjuvant radiation, which many regard as standard therapy. We designed a combination regimen to optimize the contribution of chemotherapy, decrease recurrence, and improve survival as compared with adjuvant radiation alone., METHODS: Two hundred four patients with rectal carcinoma that was either deeply invasive or metastatic to regional lymph nodes were randomly assigned to postoperative radiation alone (4500 to 5040 cGy) or to radiation plus fluorouracil, which was both preceded and followed by a cycle of systemic therapy with fluorouracil plus semustine (methyl-CCNU)., RESULTS: After a median follow-up of more than seven years, the combined therapy had reduced the recurrence of rectal cancer by 34 percent (P = 0.0016; 95 percent confidence interval, 12 to 50 percent). Initial local recurrence was reduced by 46 percent (P = 0.036; 95 percent confidence interval, 2 to 70 percent), and distant metastasis by 37 percent (P = 0.011; 95 percent confidence interval, 9 to 57 percent). In addition, combined therapy reduced the rate of cancer-related deaths by 36 percent (P = 0.0071; 95 percent confidence interval, 14 to 53 percent) and the overall death rate by 29 percent (P = 0.025; 95 percent confidence interval, 7 to 45 percent). Its acute toxic effects included nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, leukopenia, and thrombocytopenia. These effects were seldom severe. Severe, delayed treatment-related reactions, usually small-bowel obstruction requiring surgery, occurred in 6.7 percent of all patients receiving radiation, and the frequencies of these complications were comparable in both treatment groups., CONCLUSIONS: The combination of postoperative local therapy with radiation plus fluorouracil and systemic therapy with a fluorouracil-based regimen significantly and substantively improves the results of therapy for rectal carcinoma with a poor prognosis, as compared with postoperative radiation alone.",Excluded

1572,"Leukopenia is a biomarker for effective temozolomide dosing and predicts overall survival of patients with glioblastoma The median survival time of patients with glioblastoma is 14-16 months with a 5-year overall survival rate of 9.8%. Standard of care treatment includes radiation with concomitant temozolomide followed by cyclic temozolomide. If the patient develops myelosuppression (thrombocytopenia, leukopenia or anemia), the dose of temozolomide is reduced or stopped to avoid bleeding or infections. Recent studies have demonstrated that mild leukopenia is associated with increased overall survival in patients with glioblastoma. To confirm prior results showing that leukopenia is associated with increased overall survival as a primary outcome in patients with glioblastoma, the present study retrospectively collected complete blood counts from 141 patients with glioblastoma treated at the Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center (Boston, USA) between January 2012 and December 2017. According to Kaplan-Meier analysis with a log-rank test, the presence of leukopenia was associated with increased overall survival (P=0.008). Furthermore, patients with grade 2 leukopenia (Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events version 5.0) survived longer than those without myelosuppression (P=0.024). There was no difference in overall survival between patients with grade 1, 3 or 4 leukopenia and those without myelosuppression. Leukopenia was associated with longer survival independent of age or extent of surgery in Cox proportional hazards regression modeling (P=0.00205). A possible interpretation is that grade 2 leukopenia is a biomarker of adequate temozolomide dosing in a population with diverse DNA repair function, which may be the consequence of variable O6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase activity. A prospective dose escalation trial is necessary to determine if treatment-induced leukopenia is beneficial for all patients receiving temozolomide.Copyright © 2020, Spandidos Publications.

1368,"Compartments and cell flows within the mouse haemopoietic system. II. Estimated rates of interchange Part-body irradiated CBA mice were injected with CBA-T6 bone marrow. In this way a predominantly donor population was established in the femora while the marrow of the humeri remained largely (average 94%) of host origin. In animals examined cytologically up to 2 years later, no tendency was observed for the proportion of donor cells in the humeri to increase. Splenectomy had no effect on this. When femoral bone marrow from the experimental mice was injected into lethally (whole-body) irradiated recipients, cells originating from the primary host repopulated the lymph nodes to a disproportionate extent. Equilibration between the cell populations of femora and humeri occurred after re-exposure to 600 rad whole-body irradiation, but not after 100 rad or 350 rad; thus, regeneration of damaged bone marrow involved a significant contribution from extrinsic stem cells only after the highest dose of radiation. The data are compatible with an inflow of at most ten effective stem cells per humerus per day from the blood, and suggest a much lower figure. This means that few if any of the stem cells of peripheral blood enter the bone marrow and found haemopoietic clones. Evidence is adduced for the existence of a proliferating lymphoid sub-population in the bone marrow, contributing some 5-10% of the observed mitoses. The mitotic cells in the lymph nodes are replaced from marrow-derived progenitors at an estimated rate of 4-5%/day. The relevant data for the thymus are more variable, but suggest an average figure of 8-11%/day. Earlier data from mouse parabionts suggest a lower rate of inflow to the thymus.",Excluded

Method(s): Twenty-seven patients with intracranial skull base benign meningiomas treated with fractionated stereotactic radiotherapy were retrospectively reviewed. Twenty-seven cases were diagnosed as benign meningiomas on pathological (17 cases) or radiological (10 cases) examination. The median follow-up time was 90 months after initial treatment and 63 months after fractionated stereotactic radiotherapy. The median biological equivalent dose calculated using an alpha/beta ratio of 2.0 Gy was 82.0 Gy (range, 60-106 Gy). Result(s): The 5-year overall survival was 95.7 (95% confidence interval: 87.3-100)% after initial treatment and 96.2 (88.8-100)% after fractionated stereotactic radiotherapy. The 5-year overall survival and local control rate of patients who received4/8/2011 fractionated stereotactic radiotherapy alone were both 100%. The 5-year progression-free survival and local control rate after fractionated stereotactic radiotherapy were all 100% with a tumor volume of <9.1 cc and 68.2 (37.2-99.2) and 75.8 (45.2-100)% for the tumors 9.1 cc, respectively. The difference was significant in progression-free survival (P = 0.022) and local control rate (P = 0.044). The local control rate was significantly worse in patients who received fractionated stereotactic radiotherapy for relapsed tumors (P = 0.01). No late radiation damage was observed in the follow-up period. Conclusion(s): The long-term outcome suggests that fractionated stereotactic radiotherapy is a safe and effective treatment for intracranial skull base benign meningioma, especially for those who have tumors <9.1 cc or would receive fractionated stereotactic radiotherapy with or without surgery as the initial treatment. © The Author (2010).

2883,"Multifaceted applications of pre-mature chromosome condensation in radiation biodosimetry Background: Biodosimetry with persistent cytogenetic indicators in peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBLs) plays crucial role in regulatory/medical management of individuals overexposed to radiation. Conventional methods require ~48 h culture and have limited dose range (0.1-5Gy) applications due to checkpoint arrest/poor stimulation. G0-Phase Premature chromosome condensation (G0-PCC) allows chromosome aberration analysis within hours after blood collection.

Material(s) and Method(s): PBLs were exposed to Gamma-Radiation and G0-PCC was performed at different time points. Decay kinetics and dose response curve were established. Gender Variation of the frequency of the fragments was assessed at 0, 2 and 4 Gy. FISH was performed with G0-PCC applying centromere probe, whole chromosome paints, multi-color FISH and multi-color banding probes. Result(s): Radiation response curve for fragments was found to be linear (Slope 1.09 +/- 0.031 Gy-1). Background frequency as well as dose response did not show significant gender bias. Based on variation in background frequency of fragments MDL was calculated to be ~0.3 Gy. Kinetics of fragment tested at 0, 4, 8, 16 and 24 h showed exponential decay pattern from 0 to 8 h and without further decay. Final dose estimation of five samples was completed within 13 man-hours. Dicentric chromosomes, translocations, insertions and breaks were identifiable in combination with centromere FISH and WCP. Advanced methods employing multicolor FISH and multi-color banding were also demonstrated with PCC spreads. Conclusion(s): G0-PCC, can be useful tool for high dose biodosimetry with quick assessment of fragment frequency. Further, it holds potential for multi-parametric dosimetry in combination with FISH.© Copyright © 2020 Taylor & Francis Group LLC.",Included
910,"Evaluating the radioprotective effect of Cimetidine, IMOD, and hybrid radioprotectors agents: An in-vitro study INTRODUCTION: There are various radioprotective agents with different mechanisms that help to decrease ionizing radiation side effects. The radioprotective effect of Cimetidine and IMOD was assessed individually and compared with the hybrid radioprotectors agents (HRPAs-IMOD and Cimetidine) on human lymphocyte cells., METHODS: Twenty healthy volunteers (ten men and ten women) participated in the present study. About 75 mL peripheral blood lymphocytes from each individual were collected, and they were divided into 36 groups. Briefly, the blood samples were treated with different concentrations of Cimetidine (12.6 and 25.2 mug/mL) and IMOD (0.04, 0.08, and 0.12 mg/mL), and also a combination of these agents, namely hybrid radioprotectors agents (HRPAs). Besides, the irradiated groups were exposed to 2 and 4 Gy of Co-60 gamma irradiation. The amount of cellular damage was assessed using the micronucleus assay. The repeated measurements and paired T-test statistical analysis were used to compare the micronucleus frequencies in different groups., RESULTS: The micronucleus frequencies were significantly reduced (p < 0.05) in irradiated groups when the non-toxic concentrations of Cimetidine, IMOD, and HRPAs have been used. The reduction in micronucleus frequency was obtained 5-29% for Cimetidine and 40-51% for IMOD in peripheral blood lymphocytes irradiated with 2 Gy. This reduction in 4 Gy irradiation was 8-17% for Cimetidine and 27-37% for IMOD. The HRPAs resulted in a higher radioprotective effect, in a way that they cause up to 58% and 43% micronucleus frequency reduction in 2 and 4 Gy, respectively., CONCLUSION: In conclusion, the HRPAs showed the highest level of radioprotective. In addition, IMOD was remarkably higher radioprotective than Cimetidine, which may be related to its greater non-toxic concentrations. Copyright © 2021 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",Included
1767,"The use of Gamma-irradiated proximal femoral allografts for bone stock reconstruction in complex revision hip arthroplasty We have followed a consecutive series of 49 revision hip arthroplasties, performed for severe femoral bone loss using Gamma-irradiated anatomic-specific proximal femoral allografts longer than five centimetres. The patients were followed for a median 10.2 years, with a five year minimum follow-up. The median preoperative Harris Hip Score (HHS) improved from 42 points to 77 points postoperatively. In four hips the femoral component was further revised for non-union of the allograft and aseptic failure. In one hip the allograft and the femoral component were removed because of infection. In one hip the allograft and the femoral component were re-revised for host step-cut fracture. Junctional-union was observed in 44/49 hips. By defining success as an increase of HHS by 20 points or more, a stable implant and no need for any subsequent re-operations related to the allograft and /or the implant, a success rate of 76% was observed. Kaplan-Meier survivorship analysis predicted 79% rate of survival at 10 years and 75% rate of survival at 17 years, with the need for further revision of the allograft and/or implant as the end point. Three hips underwent re-attachment of the greater trochanter for trochanteric escape. Asymptomatic non-union of the greater trochanter was noticed in another three hips. Moderate allograft resorption was observed in four hips. Two fractures of the host step-cut occurred. There were four dislocations. Good long-term results with the use of large anatomic-specific femoral allografts justify their continued use in cases of revision hip arthroplasty complicated with severe femoral bone loss.",Excluded
549,"Radio-adaptive response in human lymphocytes in vitro An attempt has been made to investigate the adaptive response to ionizing radiation in the human lymphocytes in vitro using cytochalasin-B blocked micronucleated binucleate cells (mn-BNCs) as a cytogenetic end point. Whole blood samples drawn from healthy donors, of either sex were irradiated in vitro at a dose of 1 cGy (adaptive or conditioning dose) Cobalt-60 gamma radiation (dose rate 1.12 cGy/min) at about 26 hr after mitogenic stimulation. After 31 hr of their initiation, groups of cultures were subsequently exposed to a challenging dose of 100 cGy gamma radiation (dose rate 82 cGy/min.). Eight males in the age group ranging from 25 to 55 years and eight females (age group 25 to 29 years), have been analysed during this study. Analysis of data revealed 40.6% reduction in the frequency of mn-BNCs among the males with a range from 25.7% to 54.7%. In case of females, also the per cent reduction varied from 26.3% to 49.0%, with a mean value of 33.7%. Pooling the data from males and females gave an overall reduction of 37.1% in the frequency of radiation induced mn-BNCs due to pre-exposure to 1 cGy radiation.",Included
1950,"Clinical Research and Technique Note of TLIF by Wiltse Approach for the Treatment of Degenerative Lumbar Objective: To assess the clinical efficacy and share the technique notes of Wiltse Approach TLIF for the treating single segment degenerative lumbar spinal disease. Method(s): In this retrospective controlled study, 780 patients with single segment degenerative lumbar disease who were operated in our hospital from January 2016 to December 2020 were analyzed retrospectively. The patients were randomly assigned to Wiltse approach group (group A, 410 cases) and conventional open approach group (group B, 370 cases). Patient's assessment of pain and disability were evaluated by the visual analogue scale (VAS) and the Oswestry disability index (ODI) before and after surgery. The incision length, operative time, exposure time, intraoperative blood loss, hidden blood loss, time to ambulation, total length of hospitalization, serum creatine kinase, X-rays, CT and MRI were also evaluated. Result(s): There were no differences in sex, age, pre-operative ODI score, VAS score between the two groups (P > 0.05). The Wiltse approach group had a shorter incision length with 7.69 +/- 0.44 cm compared to the conventional group with 11.13 +/- 0.36 cm (P < 0.01). The average operative time was 119.20 +/- 14.64 min with exposure time of 16.20 +/- 3.42 min in the Wiltse approach group and 145.65 +/- 16.98 min with 29.20 +/- 3.42 min in the conventional group (P < 0.05, P < 0.01). Comparing the intraoperative blood loss, hidden blood loss, serum creatine kinase, time to ambulation, total length of hospitalization, the Wiltse approach group was less than the conventional open approach group (P < 0.05). The VAS score of the two groups decreased significantly with time, and the VAS score of the Wiltse group was significantly lower than that of the conventional open approach group (P < 0.05). At last investigation after operation, ODI scores of the two groups were significantly decreased compared with that before operation. Wiltse approach group was significantly lower than that of the conventional open approach group (P < 0.05). The multifidus of the two groups of patients had a certain degree of atrophy. But the Wiltse approach group multifidus muscle atrophy rate is significantly lower than the conventional open approach group. Conclusion(s): The Wiltse approach TLIF significantly reduces the damage to the paravertebral muscles and the postoperative incidence of chronic low back pain.Copyright © 2021 The Authors.

3282,"[Characteristics of the humoral immune system and lipid peroxidation processes in people living in territories contaminated with radionuclides] Among 33 patients with Stage II hypertension, 25 persons were inhabitants of the Russian radionuclide-contaminated areas and 8 patients had no prior contacts with ionizing radiation (control). All the patients examined were maintained within 4 weeks on a diet, radioprotective effect of which was realized due to the elevated content of sulfur containing amino acids, antioxidants and complexes. In the patients who lived in the radionuclide-contaminated areas, a moderate activation of lipid peroxidation was detected simultaneously with marked alterations in the humoral component of the immunity system, which involved a considerable increase in the levels of IgG and complements C3 and C4. A decrease in content of malonic dialdehyde and diene conjugates as well as normalization of IgG and decrease in content of IgA, IgM and C3 were observed in blood plasma of the patients on diet. Supplementation of omega 3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (omega 3-PUFA), 5 g/day and alpha-tocopherol, 12.5 mg/day, to the diet elevated the serum concentrations of all lg classes, which suggests the presence of an immunomodulating effect of omega 3-PUFA. Moreover, the content of malonic dialdehyde was not increased in blood plasma if 3-PUFA was used. Hence, increased alpha-tocopherol levels should be used in the treatment of these patients with omega 3-PUFA (up to 5-7 mg per g PUFA) in order to stabilize lipid peroxidation.",Excluded

3440,"Mitochondrial DNA heteroplasmy in laboratory mice experimentally enclosed in the radioactive Chernobyl environment Mitochondrial DNA heteroplasmy using the protein-coding cytochrome b (Mtcyb) gene was assessed in laboratory mice (C57BL/6 and BALB/c) exposed to the Chernobyl environment. Subacute to subchronic (30-40 days) exposure resulted in a cumulative radiation dose of 1.2-1.6 Gy ( approximately 0.04 Gy/day). Mice were sampled prior to introduction into the enclosures and again after removal from the enclosures. Nucleotide variation (site heteroplasmy) in 306 pre-exposure Mtcyb gene copies (122400 base pairs) was compared to variation in 354 postexposure gene copies (141600 base pairs). Five mutant copies, each characterized by a single nucleotide substitution, were observed (four in the pre-exposure samples, one in a postexposure sample). The frequencies of mutant gene copies and nucleotide substitutions in pre-exposure and postexposure samples were not significantly different. This suggests that this type of exposure (i.e. low dose rate) does not pose a significant mutation risk to the Mtcyb gene in digit tissue. Furthermore, no significant radiation risk to analogous human tissues may exist when occupational exposures involve low dose rates such as these. Finally, linear, cumulative models of genetic risk currently used to estimate radiation-induced effects are likely to be inappropriate for low-dose-rate exposures and need to be re-evaluated critically.",Included
3444,"Development of gravity-sensing organs in altered gravity Experiments are described in which the development of the gravity-sensing organs was studied in newt larvae reared in microgravity on the IML-2 mission and in Aplysia embryos and larvae reared on a centrifuge at 1 to 5 g. In Aplysia embryos, the statolith (single dense mass on which gravity and linear acceleration act) was reduced in size in a graded fashion at increasing g. In early post-metamorphic Aplysia or even in isolated statocysts from such animals, the number of statoconia produced is reduced at high g. Newt larvae launched before any of the otoconia were formed and reared for 15 days in microgravity had nearly adult labyrinths at the end of the IML-2 mission. The otoliths of the saccule and utricle were the same size in flight and ground-reared larvae. However, the system of aragonitic otoconia produced in the endolymphatic sac in amphibians was much larger and developed earlier in the flight-reared larvae. At later developmental stages, the aragonitic otoconia enter and fill the saccule. One flight-reared larva was maintained for nine months post-flight and the size of the saccular otolith, as well as the volume of otoconia within the endolymphatic sac, were considerably larger than in age-matched, ground-reared newts. This suggests that rearing in microgravity initiates a process that continues for several months after introduction to 1-g, which greatly increases the volume of otoconia. The flight-reared animal had abnormal posture, pointing its head upward, whereas normal ground-reared newts always keep their head horizontal. This suggests that rearing for even a short period in microgravity can have lasting functional consequences in an animal subsequently reared in 1-g conditions on Earth.",Excluded

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Three radiologists retrospectively reviewed the pretreatment x-ray angiographic and MR angiographic studies obtained in 30 consecutive patients: 15 patients (15 limbs) evaluated for limb salvage and 15 patients (20 limbs) evaluated because of claudication. MR angiography included acquisition of 2D contrast-enhanced MR digital subtraction angiograms of the area from the adductor canal to the feet and 3D spoiled gradient-recalled-echo bolus chase MR angiograms obtained in three stations from the aorta to the middle portion of the calf. Each reader reviewed the x-ray and MR angiograms to determine the inflow and outflow segments for a hypothetical bypass graft placement. RESULT(S): The three readers selected identical segments for inflow at MR angiography and x-ray angiography in 32, 32, and 35 of the 35 limbs evaluated (mean percentages of agreement [95% Cl]: 91% [77%, 98%], 91% [77%, 98%], and 95% [90%, 100%], respectively).

CONCLUSION(S): Preliminary data support the combining of 2D MR digital subtraction angiography with 3D bolus chase MR angiography to extend the utility of 3D MR angiography in treatment planning to include patients being evaluated for limb salvage, as well as those being evaluated for claudication. © RSNA, 2002.",Excluded
3543,"Optimal scan parameters for ct fluoroscopy in lung interventional radiologic procedures: Relationship between radiation dose and image quality Purpose: To evaluate the relationship between radiation doses and lung computed tomographic (CT) fluoroscopic scan parameters and to determine optimal scan parameters for performance of lung interventional radiologic (IR) procedures. Material(s) and Method(s): The institutional review board approved this prospective study, which included 32 patients with a single lung tumor;written informed consent was obtained. CT fluoroscopic images were obtained with three tube voltages (80,120,135 kV) and three tube currents (10, 20, 30 mA) in each patient. The signal-to-noise ratios(SNRs) and the contrast-to-noise ratios (CNRs) were measured quantitatively. To evaluate the feasibility of performing lung IR procedures, four readers visually scored the image quality. Acceptable CT fluoroscopic images were determined by using agreement of at least three of the four readers. The weighted CT dose index for each CT scan parameter was measured. A piecewise linear regression equation was obtained from the relationship between radiation doses and visual image scores. Result(s): Both the SNR and the CNR improved as the radiation dose increased, leading to improvement in the image quality. Acceptable image quality was achieved in 94% (30 of 32) of patients when the radiation dose was 1.18 mGy/sec (120 kV, 10 mA) and in all patients when it was greater than 1.48 mGy/sec (135 kV, 10 mA). The piecewise linear curve showed rapid improvement in image quality until the radiation dose increased to 1.48 mGy/sec (135 kV, 10 mA). When the radiation dose was increased greater than 1.48 mGy/sec, improvement in the image quality became more gradual. Conclusion(s): Results of this study can be used to guide the determination of optimal scan parameters in lung CT fluoroscopy. © RSNA, 2010.",Excluded

Sixteen medullary sponge kidney patients with complex renal calculi underwent minimally invasive percutaneous nephrolithotomy procedures in our center were entered into this retrospective study. The data analyzed included patients' demographics, stone burden, operative time, operative blood loss, length of hospital stay, complications according to the modified Clavien system, and stone-free rate. All the patients in this study had complex renal stones that included 14 multiple stones and 3 partial staghorn calculi. The mean stone surface area was 779.5 +/- 421.1 mm2. Preoperative urinary tract infection was noted in 5 (31.2 %) patients. Minimally invasive percutaneous nephrolithotomy was successfully completed in 15 renal units in 14 patients. Two patients failed the procedure. The mean operative time was 87.3 +/- 32.3 min. Mean hemoglobin drop was 25.3 +/- 16.5 g/L. An initial stone-free rate of 60 % was achieved after the procedure, and the final stone-free rate was 86.6 % after auxiliary second look and/or shock-wave lithotripsy. Clavien grade I and II complications occurred in 3 (21.4 %) patients including the one (7.1 %) patient who required transfusion. All the complications were managed conservatively. No major complications occurred. This retrospective analysis confirmed that minimally invasive percutaneous nephrolithotomy was a safe alternative treatment for the medullary sponge kidney patients with complex renal calculi. This procedure provided an acceptable stone-free rate and low incidence of high-grade complications. Stone-free rate further could be further improved with auxiliary procedures.Copyright © 2015, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.",Excluded

1458,"Potential benefits and pitfalls of respiratory-gated radiotherapy in the treatment of thoracic malignancy Aim: Despite advances in radiotherapy delivery, the prognosis of lung cancer remains poor. Higher doses of radiation have been associated with improved outcomes but may result in higher toxicities. Respiratory gated radiotherapy (RGRT) has the potential to reduce pulmonary toxicity but there are significant limitations and pitfalls to its use. The aim of this article is to (i) describe the RGRT technique currently employed at Nepean and Westmead Hospitals; (ii) discuss the practical issues of implementing such a program; (iii) present the results of our RGRT program and (iv) review the potential uncertainties in using this technique and the methods we have used to overcome these. Method(s): A retrospective review of all patients who had a 4D-computed tomography (4D-CT) scan was undertaken. Records from treatment planning systems were used to assess the prospective gating program. Result(s): Between September 2007 and June 2011, 53 patients at Nepean and 26 patients at Westmead Hospital underwent a 4D-CT. Between April and August 2011, 26 patients at Westmead Hospital underwent a prospective 4D-CT scan as treatment verification. Two of the 26 patients (7.7%) were found to have incomplete coverage of the planning target volume. Both patients underwent respiratory re-coaching, alleviating the need for replanning. Conclusion(s): RGRT may reduce doses to organs at risk with the potential for dose escalation. However its implementation requires significant staff training, treatment time and resources. Treatment verification with image guided radiation therapy are essential for safe delivery. © 2013 Wiley Publishing Asia Pty Ltd.",Excluded
1740,"Radiosensitivity: Gender and Order of Administration of G-CSF, An Experimental Study in Mice To elucidate the potential influence of stimulating bone marrow before cell-cycle-dependent irradiation, we sought to determine overall survival in mice receiving total-body irradiation (TBI) when administered granulocyte stimulating factor (G-CSF) at different time points. Gender differences were also studied. C57/BL/6J mice, aged 9-14 weeks, received 8 Gy TBI in a perspex cage using a linear accelerator. In each of five different experiments, three groups were studied: 1. one control group receiving TBI only; 2. one group treated with filgrastim [500 lg/kg subcutaneously/intraperitoneally (s.c./i.p.)] the day before TBI, followed by daily filgrastim injections postirradiation (1-5 days); and 3. one group treated with daily filgrastim injections only post-TBI (1-5 days). Each experimental group included male and female mice. Survival of the mice was monitored daily, and mice were euthanized when their condition deteriorated. A total of 293 mice were monitored for at least 37 days post-TBI. Control mice that received 8 Gy TBI showed a significant gender difference, with a median survival of 22 days in females and 17 days in males. Addition of G-CSF, irrespective of pre- or postirradiation, significantly improved survival, but in males the improvement was significantly better when G-CSF was not given before TBI. Improved survival in females was independent of the order of administration of GCSF. Multiple filgrastim injections were more effective than a single injection, and s.c. administration was not better than i.p. In conclusion, these findings indicate that male mice are more sensitive to TBI than females. Filgrastim improved survival in both genders irrespective of whether given pre- or postirradiation, but in males the improvement was significantly less if an injection was given before irradiation. These results suggest that, to prevent toxicity most effectively, GCSF should not be given before cytotoxic therapy. While a completely different experimental model was used here, these results may also be extrapolated to indicate that endocrine cell-cycle suppression therapy should not be given before or during cytotoxic therapy of hormone-dependent tumors (e.g., breast and prostate cancer), thus a reduction in the efficacy of cell-cycle-dependent therapy can be prevented.Copyright © 2019 by Radiation Research Society.

Risk factors and specific modifiers of the dose-response relationship may vary among different populations and not be well recognized. Many thyroid studies have considered thyroid nodularity itself, but not specific morphological types of thyroid nodules. There are many specific types of thyroid nodules which follow a morphological classification of thyroid lesions, including some congenital and tumor-like conditions. Modern equipment and technique can help us to identify particular specific types of thyroid nodules. In this study we report some results of a clinically applicable approach to materials derived from three studies. From 1999 through 2002, we have screened 571 current residents from 4 exposed and 1 control village near the Semipalatinsk Nuclear Test Site area, who were of similar ages (<20) at the time of major radiation fallout events at the SNTS. Prevalent nodules were identified by ultrasound and fine-needle aspiration biopsy, cytopathology results. Analysis of ultrasound images and cytopathology of thyroid lesions among exposed and non-exposed population allowed us to distinguish some interesting ultrasound features for specific types of thyroid nodules. We believe that it would be interesting and possibly more informative for thyroid dosimetry studies to consider specific morphological types of thyroid nodules. We need more detailed research to clarify the feasibility of applying these findings for study of the dose-response relationship.",Included

However, there is no consensus regarding delineation of the nodal clinical target volume (CTVn), especially for lower cervical lymph nodes. This study aimed to map the location of metastatic supraclavicular lymph nodes in thoracic esophageal carcinoma patients with supraclavicular node involvement and generate an atlas to delineate the CTVn for elective nodal radiation of esophageal squamous cell carcinoma. Patients and Methods: In this study, the supraclavicular regional lymph node was further divided into four subgroups. The locations of the involved supraclavicular nodes for all patients were then transferred onto a template computed tomography (CT) image. A volume probability map was then generated with nodal volumes, and was displayed on the template CT to provide a visual impression of nodal frequencies and anatomic distribution. Result(s): We identified 154 supraclavicular nodal metastases based on CT image in 96 patients. Of these, 29.2% were located in group I region, 59.7% in group II region, 10.4% in group III region, and 0.7% in group IV region.

Material(s) and Method(s): Multicenter prospective observational study. Patient eligibility: pathologically proven stage I-III non-small cell lung cancer planned for definitive radiotherapy (minimum 50 Gy in 20 fractions) using CT-based contouring. Volumes of the primary tumor and enlarged nodes were measured according to a standardized protocol. Survival was adjusted for the effect of T and N stage. Result(s): There were 509 eligible patients. Five-year survival rates for tumor volume grouped by quartiles were, for increasing tumor volume, 22%, 14%, 15% and 21%. Larger primary tumor volume was associated with shorter survival (HR = 1.060 (per doubling); 95% CI 1.01-1.12; P = 0.029). However, after adjusting for the effects of T and N stage, there was no evidence for an association (HR = 1.029, 95% CI, 0.96-1.10, P = 0.39). There was evidence, however, that larger primary tumor volume was associated with an increased risk of dying, independently of T and N stage, in the first 18 months but not beyond. Conclusion(s): In patients treated by non-surgical means we were unable to show that lung tumor volume, overall, provides additional prognostic information beyond the T and N stage (TNM, 6th edition). There is evidence, however, that larger primary tumor volume adversely affects outcome only within the first 18 months. Larger tumor size alone should not by itself exclude patients from curative (chemo)radiotherapy. © 2013 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.",Excluded

Method(s): This was a randomized, clinical, single-center, single-blind (participant), non-inferiority, phase IV, and parallel-group trial. The primary endpoint was the incidence of POPF. The secondary endpoints were risk factors for POPF, drain removal days, incidence of complication, 90-day mortality, and length of hospital stay. Result(s): This study evaluated a total of 53 patients, of whom 26 patients were in the intervention group (flowable hemostatic matrix) and 27 patients were in the control group (thrombin-coated collagen patch). POPF was more common in the control group than in the intervention group (59.3% vs. 30.8%, p = 0.037). Among participants who underwent distal pancreatectomy, POPF (33.3% vs. 92.3%, p = 0.004), and clinically relevant POPF (8.3% vs. 46.2%, p = 0.027) was more common in the control group. A multivariate logistic regression model identified flowable hemostatic matrix use as an independent negative risk factor for POPF, especially in cases of distal pancreatectomy (DP) (odds ratio 17.379, 95% confidential interval 1.453-207.870, p = 0.024). Conclusion(s): Flowable hemostatic matrix application is a simple, feasible, and effective method of preventing POPF after pancreatectomy, especially for patients with DP. Non-inferiority was demonstrated in the efficacy of preventing POPF in the intervention group compared to the control group.Copyright © 2020 by the authors.

3309,"Salivary and serum proteomics in head and neck carcinomas: Before and after surgery and radiotherapy Several body fluids have been evaluated as new sources for cancer biomarker discovery. In this context, salivary and serum proteomics seem promising diagnostic and predictive tools for head and neck diseases. In the present study, we performed a proteomic analysis of saliva and serum from patients presenting head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) and compared the results before and after therapy. In saliva of cancer patients, we observed an altered protein profile, including over-expression of PLUNC and zinc-alpha-2-glycoprotein. Both proteins may contribute to control tumor growth and, therefore, represent targets for new analysis. We also detected serotransferrin and a modified transthyretin form with altered levels in serum from patients. Comparing preoperative and postreatment samples, the results showed that the protein profile after treatment reverted to a pattern closer to those observed for controls. These results add information on the role of secreted proteins in the cancer process and emphasize the potential of saliva and serum analysis for diagnosis and monitoring of HNSCC. © 2010/2011 - IOS Press and the authors.

648,"The effect of oral administration of ursodeoxycholic acid and high-dose proton pump inhibitors on the histology of Barrett's esophagus Bile acids may play a role in the pathogenesis of Barrett's esophagus (BE). Bile composition can be influenced by oral administration of ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA). We prospectively investigated the effect of proton pump inhibitors (PPI) supplemented with UDCA in vivo in patients with BE. Patients with no or low-grade dysplasia who were clinically asymptomatic on PPI were eligible for the study. In order to exclude the effects of acid reflux, all patients were initially treated with 40 mg esomeprazole (ESO) twice daily for 6 months and continued on this dose till the end of the study (t = 12 months). During a period of 6 months (t = 6 month - t = 12 month) patients were treated with oral UDCA (600 mg twice daily). Patients underwent endoscopy at t = 0 months, t = 6 months and t = 12 months with multiple biopsies of the distal and proximal BE segment, normal squamous and gastric cardia. In addition, pH was measured at t = 0 months and t = 6 months using a BRAVO wireless pH capsule. Bile was sampled at the beginning of the UDCA treatment and 6 months later (t = 6 month and t = 12 month). All biopsies were reviewed for the extent of metaplasia, dysplasia, and acute and chronic inflammation. In addition, proliferation (Ki67), differentiation (villin, cytokeratins 7 and 20) and inflammation (COX-2) were investigated by immunohistochemistry (IHC). Nine patients (mean age 60 years, median BE length 7 cm) were included, of whom six had no dysplasia and three had low-grade dysplasia. pH measurements revealed a normal acid exposure in most patients at t = 0 and t = 6 months. In addition, bile composition analysis demonstrated the efficacy of UDCA. Combining the results of both phases of the study, no significant changes were seen in any of the histological or IHC parameters. Differentiation and proliferation parameters showed no significant changes. In this study, in BE patients who were clinically asymptomatic on PPI, increasing the PPI dose to the maximum for 6 months followed by the addition of UDCA for 6 months did not result in significant histological or IHC changes in their BE.",Excluded

A phase I/II trial was performed in order to evaluate both feasibility and outcome of combined radiochemotherapy in malignant glioma., PATIENTS AND METHODS: 56 patients were included in the trial. Paclitaxel was administered on days 1-4, 15-18 and 29-32 18 to 24 hours prior to irradiation. Radiotherapy with 60 Gy in conventional fractionation was initiated on day 2.31 patients were included in a dose-escalation trial starting with 20 mg/m2/d and increasing up to 60 mg/m2/d in 10-mg steps. Additional 25 patients were treated with 50 mg/m2/d., RESULTS: The regimen was very well tolerated with minimal subjective impairment such as sickness or weakness. Maximal tolerable dose was 50 mg/m2/d, with neutropenia being the dose-limiting toxicity. There were four allergic reactions and five thromboembolisms; furthermore, one patient with a normal blood count died due to pneumonia. The median survival was 12 months, and significantly favorable factors were a young age, a lower tumor grade (grade 3) and a complete resection. Varying the paclitaxel dose had no influence on outcome., CONCLUSIONS: Combined radiochemotherapy with paclitaxel in the treatment of malignant glioma was well tolerated. Maximal tolerable dose was 50 mg/m2/d. There was no increase in survival compared with results reported in the literature.",Excluded
441,"Nomogram for predicting symptom severity during radiation therapy for head and neck cancer OBJECTIVES: Radiation therapy (RT), with or without chemotherapy, can cause significant acute toxicity among patients treated for head and neck cancer (HNC), but predicting, before treatment, who will experience a particular toxicity or symptom is difficult. We created and evaluated 2 multivariate models and generated a nomogram to predict symptom severity during RT based on a patient-reported outcome (PRO) instrument, the MD Anderson Symptom Inventory-Head and Neck Module (MDASI-HN)., STUDY DESIGN: This was a prospective, longitudinal, questionnaire-based study., SETTING: Tertiary cancer care center., SUBJECTS AND METHODS: Subjects were 264 patients with HNC (mostly oropharyngeal) who had completed the MDASI-HN before and during therapy. Pretreatment variables were correlated with MDASI-HN symptom scores during therapy with multivariate modeling and then were correlated with the composite MDASI-HN score during week 5 of therapy., RESULTS: A multivariate model incorporating pretreatment PROs better predicted MDASI-HN symptom scores during treatment than did a model based on clinical variables and physician-rated patient performance status alone (Akaike information criterion = 1442.5 vs 1459.9). In the most parsimonious model, pretreatment MDASI-HN symptom severity (P < .001), concurrent chemotherapy (P = .006), primary tumor site (P = .016), and receipt of definitive (rather than adjuvant) RT (P = .044) correlated with MDASI-HN symptom scores during week 5. That model was used to construct a nomogram., CONCLUSION: Our model demonstrates the value of incorporating baseline PROs, in addition to disease and treatment characteristics, to predict patient symptom burden during therapy. Although additional investigation and validation are required, PRO-inclusive prediction tools can be useful for improving symptom interventions and expectations for patients being treated for HNC.

2019,"Argon plasma coagulation for the treatment of hemorrhagic radiation proctitis BACKGROUND AND STUDY AIMS: Chronic radiation proctitis is a complication of radiotherapy for malignant pelvic diseases. Rectal bleeding caused by radiation proctitis is difficult to manage. Argon plasma coagulation (APC) is an electrocoagulation technique that appears to be an effective and low-cost alternative to the use of lasers in gastrointestinal endoscopy. The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of APC, as well as patients' tolerance of the procedure, in the treatment of bleeding radiation-induced proctitis., PATIENTS AND METHODS: The charts of 16 patients with chronic radiation proctitis were analyzed retrospectively. Their average age was 73.5 (range 62-80). Fifteen patients had prostate cancer, and one had uterine cancer. The average time to onset of symptoms after radiotherapy was 15 months (range 6-36 months). All patients had intermittent or daily rectal bleeding, and three patients needed blood transfusions. The severity of bleeding was graded from 0 to 4. APC treatment was administered every month; the argon gas flow was set at 0.6 l/min with an electrical power setting of 40 W., RESULTS: All patients were improved with APC treatment. A mean of 3.7 sessions was necessary to relieve symptoms. APC therapy resulted in a reduction in the mean severity score from 2.4 to 0.6. Seven patients had no recurrent rectal bleeding, and the bleeding was significantly reduced to occasional and negligible spotting (less than one bleeding episode per week) in nine patients. None of the patients required transfusions after treatment. During the follow-up period (average 10.7 months, range 8-28 months), one patient had a recurrence of rectal bleeding that required two repeat sessions. The tolerance was good, with no long-term treatment-related complications., CONCLUSIONS: APC is an effective, safe and well-tolerated treatment for rectal bleeding caused by chronic radiation proctitis. It should be considered as a first-line therapy for radiation proctitis.",Excluded
762,"Measurement of lung airways in three dimensions using hyperpolarized helium-3 MRI Large airway measurement is clinically important in cases of airway disease and trauma. The gold standard is computed tomography (CT), which allows for airway measurement. However, the ionizing radiation dose associated with CT is a major limitation in longitudinal studies and trauma. To avoid ionizing radiation from CT, we present a method for measuring the large airway diameter in humans using hyperpolarized helium-3 (HPHe) MRI in conjunction with a dynamic 3D radial acquisition. An algorithm is introduced which utilizes the significant airway contrast for semi-automated segmentation and skeletonization which is used to derive the airway lumen diameter. The HPHe MRI method was validated with quantitative CT in an excised and desiccated porcine lung (linear regression R(2) = 0.974 and slope = 0.966 over 32 airway segments). The airway lumen diameters were then compared in 24 human subjects (22 asthmatics and 2 normals; linear regression R(2) value of 0.799 and slope = 0.768 over 309 airway segments). The feasibility for airway path analysis to areas of ventilation defect is also demonstrated.",Excluded

The CTO target vessel was the right coronary artery (55%), circumflex (23%), left anterior descending artery (21%), and left main or bypass graft (1%). The retrograde approach was used in 34% of all procedures. The technical and procedural success rates were 85.5 and 84.2%, respectively. The mean procedural time, fluoroscopy time, and contrast utilization were 113 +/- 61 min, 42 +/- 29 min, and 294 +/- 158 mL, respectively. Years since initiation of CTO PCI were independently associated with higher technical success rate (odds ratio [OR] = 1.52, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.52-1.70, P < 0.001), lower fluoroscopy time (OR = 0.84, 95% CI = 0.75-0.95, P = 0.005), and contrast utilization (OR = 0.84, 95% CI = 0.62-0.79, P < 0.001) during the study period., CONCLUSIONS: Among selected US-based institutions performing CTO PCI, we observed a significant reduction in total fluoroscopy time and contrast utilization paralleled with an improved technical success rate over time.

The present work describes GMP synthesis of 6-[18F]FDF in an automated synthesis unit (ASU) and dosimetry calculations to determine radiation doses in humans. GMP synthesis and dosimetry calculations are important prerequisites for first-in-human clinical studies of 6-[18F]FDF. The radiochemical synthesis of 6-[18F]FDF was optimized and adapted to an automated synthesis process using a Tracerlab FXFN ASU (GE Healthcare). Starting from 30 GBq of cyclotron-produced n.c.a. [18F]fluoride, 2.9 +/- 0.1 GBq of 6-[18F]FDF could be prepared within 50 min including HPLC purification resulting in an overall decay-corrected radiochemical yield of 14 +/- 3% (n = 11). Radiochemical purity exceeded 95%, and the specific activity was greater than 5.1 GBq/mumol. Sprague-Dawley rats were used for biodistribution experiments, and dynamic and static small animal PET experiments. Biodistribution studies served as basis for allometric extrapolation to the standard man anatomic model and normal organ-absorbed dose calculations using OLINDA/EXM software. The calculated human effective dose for 6-[18F]FDF was 0.0089 mSv/MBq. Highest organ doses with a dose equivalent of 0.0315 mSv/MBq in a humans were found in bone. Injection of 370 MBq (10 mCi) of 6-[18F]FDF results in an effective whole body radiation dose of 3.3 mSv in humans, a value comparable to that of other 18F-labeled PET radiopharmaceuticals. The optimized automated synthesis under GMP conditions, the good radiochemical yield and the favorable human radiation dosimetry estimates support application of 6-[18F]FDF in clinical trials for molecular imaging of GLUT5 in breast cancer patients.",Excluded
3165,"Different outdoor professions have different risks - a cross-sectional study comparing non-melanoma skin cancer risk among farmers, gardeners and mountain guides Background: One of the main risk factors for non-melanoma skin cancer (NMSC), the most common cancer worldwide, is solar ultraviolet radiation (UVR). This has led to the recognition of NMSC as occupational disease for outdoor workers in several countries. However, outdoor professions are a very heterogeneous group with diverse daily activities and associated UVR exposure. Objective(s): To compare the prevalence of NMSC and associated risk behaviour in different outdoor professions. Method(s): Cross-sectional study among outdoor workers (farmers, gardeners, mountain guides) and indoor workers (office employees) as control group using a paper-based questionnaire on UVR exposure and protective behaviour followed by a skin examination by a dermatologist. Result(s): A total of 563 participants (46.9% women, 46.9 +/- 13.8 years) consisting of 348 outdoor workers (38.8% farmer, 35.3% gardener, 25.9% mountain guides) and 215 indoor workers were included in the study between March and September 2017. NMSC incl. actinic keratosis was diagnosed in 33.3% of mountain guides, 27.4% of farmers, 19.5% of gardeners and in 5.6% of indoor workers. Significant differences were seen between the outdoor professions with mountain guides at highest risk compared to farmers (OR = 2.6, 95% CI = 1.2-5.7). Substantial differences between the professions were also seen in skin cancer screening attendance rates (indoor worker 61.4%, mountain guides 57.8%, farmers 31.9%, gardeners 27.6%), daily UVR exposure during work and protective behaviour such as sunscreen use during work. Conclusion(s): Different outdoor professions have significant different risks for NMSC and show different risk behaviour. Tailoring prevention efforts to different professions based on their individual needs could be the key to lower the global burden of (occupational) NMSC.Copyright © 2018 European Academy of Dermatology and Venereology",Excluded

The plan quality and performance of dual arc-VMAT (DA-VMAT) using the Pinnacle3 Smart-Arc system (clinical version 9.0; Philips, Fitchburg, WI, USA) were evaluated and compared with those of seven-field (7F)-IMRT in 18 consecutive NPC patients. Analysis parameters included the conformity index (CI) and homogeneity index (HI) for the planning target volume (PTV), maximum and mean dose, normal tissue complication probability (NTCP) for the specified organs at risk (OARs), and comprehensive quality index (CQI) for an overall evaluation in the 11 OARs. Treatment delivery time, monitor units per fraction (MU/fr), and Gamma(3 mm, 3%) evaluations were also analyzed. DA-VMAT achieved similar target coverage and slightly better homogeneity than conventional 7F-IMRT with a similar CI and HI. NTCP values were only significantly lower in the left parotid gland (for xerostomia) for DA-VMAT plans. The mean value of CQI at 0.98 +/- 0.02 indicated a 2% benefit in sparing OARs by DA-VMAT. The MU/fr used and average delivery times appeared to show improved efficiencies in DA-VMAT. Each technique demonstrated high accuracy in dose delivery in terms of a high-quality assurance (QA) passing rate (> 98%) of the Gamma(3 mm, 3%) criterion. The major difference between DA-VMAT and 7F-IMRT using a sequential mode for treating NPC cases appears to be improved efficiency, resulting in a faster delivery time and the use of fewer MU/fr.",Excluded
3549,"Carotid blowout syndrome in pharyngeal cancer patients treated by hypofractionated stereotactic re-irradiation using CyberKnife: A multi-institutional matched-cohort analysis BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Although reirradiation has attracted attention as a potential therapy for recurrent head and neck tumors with the advent of modern radiotherapy, severe rate toxicity such as carotid blowout syndrome (CBOS) limits its potential. The aim of this study was to identify the risk factors of CBOS after hypofractionated stereotactic radiotherapy (SBRT)., METHODS AND PATIENTS: We conducted a matched-pair design examination of pharyngeal cancer patients treated by CyberKnife reirradiation in four institutes. Twelve cases with CBOS were observed per 60 cases without CBOS cases. Prognostic factors for CBOS were analyzed and a risk classification model was constructed., RESULTS: The median prescribed radiation dose was 30 Gy in 5 fractions with CyberKnife SBRT after 60 Gy/30 fractions of previous radiotherapy. The median duration between reirradiation and CBOS onset was 5 months (range, 0-69 months). CBOS cases showed a median survival time of 5.5 months compared to 22.8 months for non-CBOS cases (1-year survival rate, 36% vs.72%; p=0.003). Univariate analysis identified an angle of carotid invasion of >180degree, the presence of ulceration, planning treatment volume, and irradiation to lymph node areas as statistically significant predisposing factors for CBOS. Only patients with carotid invasion of >180degree developed CBOS (12/50, 24%), whereas no patient with tumor involvement less than a half semicircle around the carotid artery developed CBOS (0/22, 0%, p=0.03). Multivariate Cox hazard model analysis revealed that the presence of ulceration and irradiation to lymph nodes were statistically significant predisposing factors. Thus, we constructed a CBOS risk classification system: CBOS index=(summation of risk factors; carotid invasion >180degree, presence of ulceration, lymph node area irradiation). This system sufficiently separated the risk groups., CONCLUSION: The presence of ulceration and lymph node irradiation are risk factors of CBOS. The CBOS index, including carotid invasion of >180degree, is useful in classifying the risk factors and determining the indications for reirradiation. Copyright © 2015.

258,"Stimulus intensity affects early sensory processing: visual contrast modulates evoked gamma-band activity in human EEG We studied the effect of different contrast levels on the visual evoked gamma-band response (GBR) in order to investigate whether the GBR is modulated in a similar manner as previously reported for visual evoked potentials. Previous studies showed that the GBR can be modulated by individual characteristics (age) and experimental conditions (task difficulty, attention). However, stimulus properties, such as size and spatial frequency, also have a large impact on the GBR, which necessitates identification and control of relevant stimulus properties for optimal experimental setups. Twenty-one healthy participants were investigated during a forced-choice discrimination task. Sinusoidal gratings were presented at three contrast levels with a constant spatial frequency of 5 cycles per degree visual arc (cpd). The present data replicate the results reported for visual evoked potentials and exhibit a contrast dependent modulation of the GBR. Gamma activity is increased for higher contrast levels. These results demonstrate the importance of stimulus contrast for evoked gamma activity. Thus, it appears meaningful to control the contrast of stimuli in experiments investigating the role of gamma activity in perception and information processing.",Excluded

To determine whether female patients operated on for non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) have a survival advantage compared to male patients. Methods and study design. We analyzed data from 1,426 prospectively collected patients submitted to lung resection for NSCLC between 1999 and 2008. Results. Two groups, including 1,014 male and 412 female patients, were compared. Female patients were significantly younger, were more frequently asymptomatic, were less likely to be smokers, had better preoperative respiratory function, had a lower frequency of COPD, and were less commonly affected by cardiovascular comorbidity than men. Adenocarcinoma was more frequently present and early pathological stage (stage IA) more frequently detected in women at diagnosis. The operative mortality was significantly lower among women (1.6% vs 4.6%) (P = 0.012), and women underwent significantly more segmentectomies and fewer pneumonectomies (P = 0.001). The disease-related 5-year survival rate was significantly higher in women (66% vs 51%) (P = 0.0008). At univariate analysis the absence of symptoms at presentation, lower pathological stage, squamous cell type, and female gender were positive factors influencing long-term survival. At multivariate analysis low pathological stage, squamous cell type and female gender were confirmed as independent positive prognostic predictors. Women had a significant survival advantage irrespective of the histological subtype at pathological stage IA, IB, IIB and IIIA disease (P <0.05). Conclusions. Female gender was confirmed to be a particular subset amongst patients affected by NSCLC and exerted a positive effect on disease-related survival of patients submitted to surgical resection. This important effect of gender should be cautiously kept in mind in analyzing the results of current and future trials for lung cancer therapy.",Excluded

We retrospectively analyzed 232 patients with Stage T1-3 N0-3 M0 NPC who underwent definitive IMRT with or without additional ICBT boost between 2002 and 2013. For most of the 124 patients who had ICBT boost, the additional brachytherapy was given as 6 Gy in 2 fractions completed within 1 week after IMRT of 70 Gy. CCRT with or without adjuvant chemotherapy was used for 176 patients, including 88 with and 88 without ICBT boost, respectively. The mean follow-up time was 63.1 months. The 5-year overall survival and local control rates were 81.5% and 91.5%, respectively. ICBT was not associated with local control prediction (P = 0.228). However, in a subgroup analysis, 75 T1 patients with ICBT boost had significantly better local control than the other 71 T1 patients without ICBT boost (98.1% vs 85.9%, P = 0.020), despite having fewer patients who had undergone chemotherapy (60.0% vs 76.1%, P = 0.038). Multivariate analysis showed that both ICBT (P = 0.029) and chemotherapy (P = 0.047) influenced local control for T1 patients. Our study demonstrated that dose escalation with ICBT can improve local control of the primary tumor for NPC patients with T1 disease treated with IMRT, even without chemotherapy.

Material(s) and Method(s): Thirty-eight patients with T1-4, N0-2, M0 NPC received conventional radiotherapy. Stimulated whole saliva was collected at baseline and 2, 6 and 12 months after radiotherapy. Salivary anions levels were measured using ion chromatography. Result(s): A reduction in stimulated saliva flow and salivary pH was accompanied by sustained changes in anionic composition. At 2 months following radiotherapy, there was a significant increase in chloride, sulphate, lactate and formate levels while significant reductions in nitrate and thiocyanate levels were found. No further changes in these anion levels were observed at 6 and 12 months. No significant changes were found in phosphate, acetate, or propionate levels throughout the study period. Conclusion(s): Conventional radiotherapy has a significant and prolonged impact on certain anionic species, likely contributing to increased cariogenic properties and reduced antimicrobial capacities of saliva in NPC patients post-radiotherapy.Copyright © 2016 Pow et al.

Methods and Materials: In this multicenter prospective study, patients scheduled to receive nCRT followed by esophagectomy for esophageal cancer underwent 18F-FDG PET/CT and DW-MRI scanning before the start of nCRT, during nCRT, and before esophagectomy. Response to nCRT was based on histopathologic evaluation of the resection specimen. Relative changes in 18F-FDG PET/CT and DW-MRI parameters were compared between patients with pCR and non-pCR groups. Multivariable ridge regression analyses with bootstrapped c-indices were performed to evaluate the individual and combined value of 18F-FDG PET/CT and DW-MRI. Result(s): pCR was found in 26.1% of 69 patients. Relative changes in 18F-FDG PET/CT parameters after nCRT (DELTA standardized uptake value [SUV]mean,post P = .016, and DELTA total lesion glycolysis post P = .024), as well as changes in DW-MRI parameters during nCRT (DELTA apparent diffusion coefficient [ADC]during P = .008) were significantly different between pCR and non-pCR. A c-statistic of 0.84 was obtained for a model with DELTAADCduring, DELTASUVmean,post, and histology in classifying patients as pCR (versus 0.82 for DELTAADCduring and 0.79 for DELTASUVmean,post alone). Conclusion(s): Changes on 18F-FDG PET/CT after nCRT and early changes on DW-MRI during nCRT can help identify pCR to nCRT in esophageal cancer. Moreover, 18F-FDG PET/CT and DW-MRI might be of complementary value in the assessment of pCR.Copyright © 2020 Elsevier Inc.",Excluded
2145,"Clinical PET of neuroendocrine tumors using 64Cu-DOTATATE: first-in-humans study UNLABELLED: The use of positron emitter-labeled compounds for somatostatin receptor imaging (SRI) has become attractive because of the prospect of improved spatial resolution, accelerated imaging procedures, and the ability to quantify tissue radioactivity concentrations. This paper provides results from first-in-humans use of (64)Cu-DOTATATE, an avidly binding somatostatin receptor ligand linked to a radioisotope with intermediate half-life and favorable positron energy (half-life, 12.7 h; maximum positron energy, 0.653 MeV)., METHODS: In a prospective setup, 14 patients with a history of neuroendocrine tumors underwent both PET/CT with (64)Cu-DOTATATE and SPECT/CT with our current routine imaging agent (111)In-diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid-octreotide. After intravenous injection of 193-232 MBq of (64)Cu-DOTATATE, whole-body PET scans were acquired at 1 h (n = 14), 3 h (n = 12), and 24 h (n = 5) after administration. Tissue radioactivity concentrations for normal organs and lesions were quantified, and standardized uptake values were calculated for the early (1 h) and delayed (3 h) scans. Using the data for 5 patients, we assessed the radiation dose with OLINDA/EXM software. Furthermore, the clinical performance of (64)Cu-DOTATATE with respect to lesion detection was compared with conventional SRI., RESULTS: SRI with (64)Cu-DOTATATE produced images of excellent quality and high spatial resolution. Images were characterized by high and stable tumor-to-background ratios over an imaging time window of at least 3 h. Compared with conventional scintigraphy, (64)Cu-DOTATATE PET identified additional lesions in 6 of 14 patients (43%). In 5 patients, lesions were localized in organs and organ systems not previously known as metastatic sites, including the early-stage detection of a secondary neuroendocrine tumor in a patient with a known mutation in the multiple endocrine neoplasia type I gene. All major additional findings seen only on PET could be confirmed on the basis of a clinical follow-up interval of 18 mo. Calculated radiation dose estimates yielded an effective dose of 6.3 mSv for an injected activity of 200 MBq of (64)Cu-DOTATATE, with the liver being the organ with the highest absorbed radiation dose (0.16 mGy/MBq)., CONCLUSION: This first-in-humans study supports the clinical use of (64)Cu-DOTATATE for SRI with excellent imaging quality, reduced radiation burden, and increased lesion detection rate when compared with (111)In-diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid-octreotide.",Excluded
1069,"Effects of X-rays and cigarette smoking on leukocyte, lymphocyte and mitotic index values and SCE rates: the relationship between mitotic index and lymphocyte count Many previous studies revealed that smoking increases leukocyte and lymphocyte counts while exposure to X-rays decreases these counts. However the relationships between lymphocyte life span and smoking as well as X-rays were not well documented. The primary aim of this study was to determine relationships between smoking X-rays (in combination and individually) and life span of lymphocytes. Blood samples from 200 healthy individuals, half of which were X-ray exposed individuals, were collected. Half of X-ray exposed and of non-X-ray exposed individuals were smokers. There were equal numbers of male and female participants. Two lymphocyte cultures, one for the sister chromatid exchange (SCE) analysis and the other for the determination of mitotic index values were prepared using one part of the blood samples collected from the individuals. From the other part of the blood sample leukocyte and lymphocyte counts were determined with a haemogram device. Evaluation of the findings suggested that leukocyte count, lymphocyte count, mitotic index were relatively lower for the X-ray exposed individuals. In addition these values were higher for smokers than nonsmokers in general. The highest SCE rates were recorded for smoking radiology technicians. The most important finding is that lymphocyte life span is relatively low in smokers and in X-ray exposed males.",Included
3318,"Effects of 2 different swallowing exercise regimens during organ-preservation therapies for head and neck cancers on swallowing function Background. This study investigated the effects of 2 different swallowing exercise regimens performed during radiation therapy with/without chemotherapy on swallowing function. Methods. Fifty patients were recruited prospectively to 2 groups (the exercise group, n = 26 and the repetitive swallow group, n = 24). Functional Oral Intake Scale (FOIS) scores and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) placements were compared at posttreatment and at 3 months. Results. The exercise group eliminated significantly more PEG tubes at 3 months posttreatment compared to the swallow group (16% vs 50%). Among patients who received both radiation and chemotherapy, the exercise group had significantly less PEG tubes immediately posttreat-ment as well as 3 months posttreatment (35% and 10%), compared to the swallow group (69% and 50%). Conclusion. Findings indicate significant benefits of the exercise group's exercise regimen in reducing PEG dependence and oral intake difficulties.Copyright © 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",Excluded

2862,"Microvascular decompression after gamma knife surgery for trigeminal neuralgia: intraoperative findings and treatment outcomes OBJECT: The authors sought to determine whether the results of trigeminal microvascular decompression (MVD) are influenced by prior gamma knife surgery (GKS). METHOD(S): Gamma knife surgery is an established procedure for treating medically intractable trigeminal neuralgia but failures do occur. The authors assessed six patients (two men and four women; mean age 52 years) who experienced pain recurrence after GKS and elected to undergo trigeminal MVD via retrosigmoid craniotomy. Three patients underwent a single GKS to a maximal dose of 80 Gy, whereas three others underwent a second GKS to total of 120 to 135 Gy. At surgery, none of the six patients demonstrated excess arachnoid thickening, grossly apparent changes in the nerve itself, or any other tissue alterations that made successful mobilization of a blood vessel from the trigeminal root entry zone technically more difficult. A single individual had a small atherosclerotic plaque in the superior cerebellar artery near its contact point with the trigeminal nerve. Follow up at a mean of 25.4 months (range 7.5-42 months) indicated that five patients were pain free. One patient had improved but still relied on medications for pain control. CONCLUSION(S): In the authors' experience, trigeminal MVD can be performed without added difficulty in patients who have previously undergone GKS. The success rates seem similar to those normally associated with MVD. Patients who elect the less invasive option of GKS can be assured that trigeminal MVD remains a viable alternative at a later date if further surgery is required.",Excluded
3312,"Weekly 70 Gy thoracic radiotheraphy concurrent with docetaxel or paclitaxel after induction chemotherapy of patients with locally advanced non-small cell lung cancer: Prospective study of tolerance and efficacy Introduction: Chemotherapy (CT) and thoracic radiotherapy (TRT) constitute the standard care of patients with inoperable/unresectable locally advanced NSCLC. However, the optimal schedule of treatment remains to be determined. Method(s): A prospective study was conducted in patients with locally advanced stage IIIA or IIIB NSCLC, to determine the tolerability and local control obtained with 7 weekly courses of concurrent chemo-radiotherapy using Docetaxel (D: 20 mg/m2) or Paclitaxel (P: 60 mg/m2) and TRT (2 Gy daily Monday through Friday, totalizing 70 Gy in the seven weeks), after 3 cycles of cisplatinum-based induction chemotherapy (cisplatinum + gemcitabine +/- vinorelbine). Result(s): From December 1999 to December 2004, fifty two out of 129 patients treated with induction chemotherapy and at least with stable disease were considered eligible for analysis. Twenty seven were treated with docetaxel (D) and twenty five with paclitaxel (P). The average of weeks of treatment was 5 for D (range 7-3) and 6 for P (7-1), and 40% and 58% of patients respectively in each group completed 7 weeks and received the programmed doses. Significant toxicity during concurrent therapy included (D/P %): esophagitis (grade I, 22/18; grade II, 25/29; grade III, 30/8), pneumonitis (grades I-II, 14/5), diarrhea (grades I-II, 14/0). The percentage of local progression and median time elapsed were 41% and 180 days in the D group of patients, and 46% and 240 days in the P group. Conclusion(s): No definitive conclusions can be made, considering the small size of the sample in this study, but the observed trends suggest that concurrent chemo-radiotherapy employing TRT and Docetaxel or Paclitaxel administered weekly offer similar local efficacy, Paclitaxel showing a lower toxicity.",Excluded

1656,"Addition of Astatine-211-Labeled Anti-CD45 Antibody to TBI as Conditioning for DLA-Identical Marrow Transplantation: A Novel Strategy to Overcome Graft Rejection in a Canine Presensitization Model: ""Radioimmunotherapy to Overcome Transfusion-Induced Sensitization"" In a canine model of presensitization using donor blood transfusions, 100% of historical control dogs receiving 9.2 Gy total body irradiation (TBI) conditioning before dog leukocyte antigen (DLA)-identical marrow grafts had graft rejection. In this presensitization model, we investigated whether the addition of monoclonal antibody (mAb)-based targeted radioimmunotherapy (RIT) with astatine-211 (211At) to TBI could overcome graft rejection. 211At is an alpha-particle-emitting isotope that has a short path length, very high energy, and a short t1/2 of 7.2 hours, which allowed targeting radiation to the T cells responsible for graft rejection. Normal canine recipients were given three preceding transfusions of unirradiated whole blood on days -24, -17, and -10 before transplant from their DLA-identical marrow donors. 211At-anti-CD45 mAb was administered on day -3, and TBI followed by marrow grafts on day 0. Six of the 7 dogs (86%) achieved sustained engraftment as assessed by 100% donor chimerism in mononuclear cells, granulocytes, and CD3+ T cells. One dog receiving the lowest CD34+ cell content (0.35 x 106 cells/kg) rejected the graft. There were no late rejections in dogs followed up to 1 year. Graft-versus-host disease was seen in one dog. 211At-anti-CD45 mAb in combination with TBI as conditioning was successful in abrogating graft rejection in 86% of dogs in this presensitization model. 211At-anti-CD45 mAb conditioning with TBI may serve as a novel promising strategy to overcome graft rejection in heavily transfused patients with red cell disorders.Copyright © 2021 The American Society for Transplantation and Cellular Therapy",Excluded
3657,"Relation between clinical mature and immature lymphocyte cells in human peripheral blood and their spatial label free scattering patterns A single living cell's light scattering pattern (LSP) in the horizontal plane, which has been denoted as the cell's ""2D fingerprint,"" may provide a powerful label-free detection tool in clinical applications. We have recently studied the LSP in spatial scattering planes, denoted as the cell's ""3D fingerprint,"" for mature and immature lymphocyte cells in human peripheral blood. The effects of membrane size, morphology, and the existence of the nucleus on the spatial LSP are discussed. In order to distinguish clinical label-free mature and immature lymphocytes, the special features of the spatial LSP are studied by statistical method in both the spatial and frequency domains. Spatial LSP provides rich information on the cell's morphology and contents, which can distinguish mature from immature lymphocyte cells and hence ultimately it may be a useful label-free technique for clinical leukemia diagnosis.",Excluded
906,"The characteristics of esophagogastric junction contractile index in patients with gastroesophageal reflux disease or functional heartburn OBJECTIVE: To study the role of esophagogastric junction contractile index (EGJ-CI) in evaluating the function of anti-reflux barrier, and in differentiating patients with gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) from those with functional heartburn (FH)., METHODS: A total of 115 patients presenting heartburn were enrolled in the study from January 2012 to June 2015.All subjects had completed Gerd-Q questionnaire and undergone gastroscopy, 24-hour pH-impedance monitoring and esophageal high-resolution manometry. GERD patients were divided into as reflux esophagitis, acid-nonerosive reflux disease (NERD) and weakly acid-NERD groups. Patients with normal esophageal mucosa, normal acid exposure and negative proton pump inhibitor test were enrolled in FH group. EGJ-CI (mmHg.cm) as well as EGJ rest pressure and 4s integrated relaxation pressure (IRP 4s) were measured., RESULTS: Among the 115 patients, 18 were reflux esophagitis [(49.0+/-18.9) years, M:F=10:8], 25 were acid-NERD [(48.7+/-14.4) years, M:F=13:12], 37 were weakly acid-NERD [(52.0+/-14.8) years, M:F=15:22] and 35 were FH [(53.6+/-14.8), M:F=8:27]. No differences of Gerd-Q scores were noticed between the four groups. (1)Negative correlations were demonstrated between EGJ-CI and esophageal acid exposure time (r=-0.283, P=0.002), EGJ-CI and acid reflux events (r=-0.233, P=0.012), EGJ-CI and weakly acid reflux events (r=-0.213, P=0.022), EGJ-CI and non-acid reflux events (r=-0.200, P=0.032). (2)The value of EGJ-CI was significantly higher in FH patients than in the three subgroups of GERD(all P<0.01). EGJ rest pressure of FH group was higher than that of acid-NERD (P<0.01). IRP 4s in acid-NERD group was lower than that of FH and weakly acid-NERD (P<0.05). (3)The area under curve (AUC) of EGJ-CI was higher than that of EGJ-CIT, EGJ rest pressure or IRP 4s(0.686 vs 0.678, 0.641 and 0.578). The cut-off value of EGJ-CI to differentiate GERD from FH was 9.74 mmHg.cm with sensitivity 82.86% and specificity 51.52%., CONCLUSIONS: The EGJ-CI values are negatively correlated with esophageal acid exposure time, weakly acid reflux events and non-acid reflux events. Thus it might be used as a metric to reflect the anti-reflux function of EGJ. According to the cut-off value of EGJ-CI 9.74 mmHg.cm, patients with GERD can be sensitively differentiated from patients with FH.",Excluded
2844,"Can Radiation Dose Burden of CT Angiography be Reduced While Still Accurately Diagnosing Etiology of Acute Chest Pain? Background: Multidetector-row computed tomography is often used as a first-line test in the diagnostic evaluation of cardiovascular diseases including aortic dissection, coronary artery disease and pulmonary embolism. This study evaluated the impact of reducing the tube potential from 120 kVp to 100 kVp in a selected group of patients presenting to the Emergency Room with acute chest pain. The primary end point was how the reduction of radiation dose affected image quality. Method(s): The current study was performed over a period of 2 years between July, 2016 and July, 2018. This study included patients who presented to the Emergency Room or to an outpatient clinic and were suspected to have a coronary, a pulmonary (pulmonary embolism), or an aortic (aortic dissection) etiology. Suspicion was determined by the medical provider based on clinical picture, EKG, and lab results when available. All patients were referred for computed tomography angiography (CTA) testing as part of their diagnostic evaluation. A total of 84 patients were involved in the study. Seventy of the patients underwent the low acquisition Kvp technique (100 Kvp - Group I). In the remaining 14 patients, the standard acquisition technique (120-140 Kvp - Group II) was utilized. Result(s): This study showed the feasibility of using low energy CTA to significantly reduce the patient's radiation exposure without markedly affecting the image quality and diagnostic accuracy. Conclusion(s): The use of low energy CTA protocols in cases of acute chest pain revealed no major difference regarding the image quality with marked reduction of the radiation dose received by the patient.Copyright © 2020 Elsevier Inc.",Excluded

Caregivers of the patient may receive higher radiation doses than normal. The purposes of this study were to estimate the total effective dose equivalent from internal and external exposure to caregivers of patients treated with high dose I-131 admitted at Siriraj Hospital, and to compare the estimated dose with the dose constraint of 5 mSv per annum for caregivers. Thirteen caregivers of 13 patients who underwent radioiodine therapy for thyroid cancers following a standard protocol were given specific instructions with regard to radiation safety and were attached to an electronic personal dosimeter and a personal air sampler pump continuously to measure received radiation dose on a daily basis over three days in the hospital. On discharge day, caregivers were asked to perform an in vivo bioassay by the thyroid uptake instrument. The results from the thirteen caregivers were divided into 3 groups. The total effective dose equivalent to caregivers of patients administered 3.7 GBq (n = 1), 5.55 GBq (n = 9), and 7.4 GBq (n = 3) were 0.159 mSv, 0.123 to 0.629 mSv, and 0.631 to 0.718 mSv, respectively.

Randolph Lovelace II suggested that it would be more practical from an engineering standpoint to send women rather than men into space due to their lower body weights and oxygen requirements. When the Air Force decided not to pursue this project, Dr. Lovelace assumed leadership of the Woman in Space Program and began medical and physiological testing of a series of accomplished women aviators at the Lovelace Medical Clinic in Albuquerque, NM, in 1960. The tests that these women underwent were identical to those used to test the original Mercury astronauts, with the addition of gynecological examinations. Thirteen of the nineteen women tested passed these strenuous physiological exams (for comparison, 18 of 32 men tested passed); a subset of these pilots was further tested on a series of psychological exams that were similar to or, in some instances, more demanding than those given to male Mercury candidates. Despite these promising results, further testing was halted, and the Woman in Space Program was disbanded in 1962.

In this study, radiation-induced kidney injury represented by changes of creatinine clearance (Ccr) and renal parenchymal volume measured by computed tomography (CT) were evaluated by analysing dose-volume histograms (DVHs) in patients with primary gastric diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (PGDLBCL) treated with chemoradiotherapy., MATERIALS AND METHODS: Thirty-eight PGDLBCL patients (seventy-six kidneys) treated with chemoradiotherapy were included in this study. At least 4 years of follow-up was required for eligibility. Patients underwent (immuno-) chemotherapy followed by radiotherapy with approximately 40Gy to the whole stomach and perigastric lymph nodes. Ccr and CT were obtained at least annually. Changes of Ccr and renal parenchymal volume before and 4years after radiotherapy were compared using DVH parameters., RESULTS: Mean Ccr decreased significantly from 82.7mL/min (range, 39-124mL/min) before radiotherapy to 70.4mL/min (range, 35-109mL/min) (p=0.01) 4years after radiotherapy.

The prospective study included 25 patients who were referred to CT scan for the assessment of pulmonary metastases. All patients underwent CT examinations at both standard- (200 mA, 120 kV, collimation 5 mm, table feed 10 mm per rotation) and low-dose (50 mA, 120 kV, collimation 5 mm, table feed 10 mm per rotation). The number of nodules detected at each protocol was recorded. The size of the nodules was measured electronically and categorized as <3, 3-4.9, 5-6.9, 7-9.9, and >/=10 mm. Finally, the nodules detected at only standard- or low-dose CT were assessed for the underlying causes of discrepancy. In 25 patients, 533 nodules were detected at standard-dose, whereas 518 nodules were observed at low-dose CT. There were no statistically significant differences in the number of nodules detected at standard- or low-dose CT ( p>0.05). Four hundred ninety-one (87.7%) nodules were detected at both standard- or low-dose CT, 42 (7.5%) nodules were observed only at standard-dose CT, and 27 (4.8%) nodules were seen only at low-dose CT. The sensitivity of low-dose CT was 92.5% for all nodules, 88.1% for nodules <5 mm, and 97.4% for nodules >/=5 mm. No significant image artifact interfering with nodule detection was observed at low-dose CT.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Institutional review board approval and informed consent were obtained. The study included 107 patients (62 men, 45 women; mean age, 55 years; range, 22-81 years) with a solitary pulmonary nodule. After unenhanced CT (2.5-mm collimation) scans were obtained, dynamic CT was performed by using a helical technique (series of images obtained throughout the nodule, with 2.5-mm collimation, at 30, 60, 90, and 120 seconds and 4, 5, 9, 12, and 15 minutes) after intravenous injection of contrast medium (120 mL). Tissue diagnosis was made in 70 nodules, and follow-up images showed benignancy in the remaining 37 (no change in size, n = 32; decrease in size, n = 5). CT findings were analyzed in terms of wash-in and washout of contrast medium. Sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy for malignant nodules were calculated by considering both the wash-in and washout characteristics at dynamic CT. RESULT(S): There were 49 malignant and 58 benign nodules. When diagnostic criteria for malignancy of both wash-in of 25 HU or greater and washout of 5-31 HU were applied, sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy for malignancy were 94% (46 of 49 nodules), 90% (52 of 58 nodules), and 92% (98 of 107 nodules), respectively.

231,"Randomized trial addressing risk features and time factors of surgery plus radiotherapy in advanced head-and-neck cancer Purpose: A multi-institutional, prospective, randomized trial was undertaken in patients with advanced head-and-neck squamous cell carcinoma to address (1) the validity of using pathologic risk features, established from a previous study, to determine the need for, and dose of, postoperative radiotherapy (PORT); (2) the impact of accelerating PORT using a concomitant boost schedule; and (3) the importance of the overall combined treatment duration on the treatment outcome. Methods and Materials: Of 288 consecutive patients with advanced disease registered preoperatively, 213 fulfilled the trial criteria and went on to receive therapy predicated on a set of pathologic risk features: no PORT for the low-risk group (n=31); 57.6 Gy during 6.5 weeks for the intermediate-risk group (n=31); and, by random assignment, 63 Gy during 5 weeks (n=76) or 7 weeks (n=75) for the high-risk group. Patients were irradiated with standard techniques appropriate to the site of disease and likely areas of spread. The study end points were locoregional control (LRC), survival, and morbidity. Result(s): Patients with low or intermediate risks had significantly higher LRC and survival rates than those with high-risk features (p=0.003 and p=0.0001, respectively), despite receiving no PORT or lower dose PORT, respectively. For high-risk patients, a trend toward higher LRC and survival rates was noted when PORT was delivered in 5 rather than 7 weeks. A prolonged interval between surgery and PORT in the 7-week schedule was associated with significantly lower LRC (p=0.03) and survival (p=0.01) rates. Consequently, the cumulative duration of combined therapy had a significant impact on the LRC (p=0.005) and survival (p=0.03) rates. A 2-week reduction in the PORT duration by using the concomitant boost technique did not increase the late treatment toxicity. Conclusion(s): This Phase III trial established the power of risk assessment using pathologic features in determining the need for, and dose of, PORT in patients with advanced head-and-neck squamous cell cancer in a prospective, multi-institutional setting. It also revealed the impact of the overall treatment time in the combination of surgery and PORT on the outcome in high-risk patients and showed that PORT acceleration without a reduction in dose by a concomitant boost regimen did not increase the late complication rate. These findings emphasize the importance of coordinated interdisciplinary care in the delivery of combined surgery and RT. © 2001 Elsevier Science Inc.",Included
1008,"Cytogenetic and molecular characterization of plutonium-induced rat osteosarcomas The association between ionizing radiation and the subsequent development of osteosarcoma has been well described, but little is known about the cytogenetic and molecular events, which could be involved in the formation of radiation-induced osteosarcomas. Here, we performed comparative genomic hybridization (CGH) to detect chromosomal copy number changes in a series of 16 rat osteosarcomas induced by injection of plutonium-238. Recurrent gains/amplifications were observed at chromosomal regions 3p12-q12, 3q41-qter, 4q41-qter, 6q12-q16, 7q22-q34, 8q11-q23, 9q11-q22, 10q32.1-qter, and 12q, whereas recurrent losses were observed at 1p, 1q, 3q23-q35, 5q21-q33, 8q24-q31, 10q22-q25, 15p, 15q, and 18q. The gained region at 7q22-q34 was homologous to human chromosome bands 12q13-q15/8q24/22q11-q13, including the loci of Mdm2, Cdk4, c-Myc and Pdgf-b genes. The lost regions at 5q21-q33, 10q22-q25 and 15q contained tumor suppressor genes such as p16INK4a/p19ARF, Tp53 and Rb1. To identify potential target gene(s) for the chromosomal aberrations, we compared the expression levels of several candidate genes, located within the regions of frequent chromosomal aberrations, between the tumors and normal osteoblasts by using quantitative RT-PCR analysis. The Cdk4, c-Myc, Pdgf-b and p57KIP2 genes were thought to be possible target genes for the frequent chromosomal gain at 7q22-34 and loss at 1q in the tumors, respectively. In addition, mutations of the Tp53 gene were found in 27% (4 of 15) osteosarcomas. Our data may contribute to further understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying osteosarcomas induced by ionizing radiation in human.",Excluded
2070,"Radiation Exposure to the Surgeon, Surgical Assistant, and Scrub Nurse during Closed Intramedullary Nailing of Long Bones-Does It Vary Depending on the Experience of the Surgeon? Objectives:To assess radiation exposure (RE) to the surgical team and fluoroscopy time (FT) during closed nailing of long bone fractures performed under fluoroscopic guidance with regard to surgeon's experience. Design(s):Prospective observational study. Setting(s):Level-1 trauma center. Participant(s):Surgical team, comprising a surgeon, a surgical assistant, and a scrub nurse, for closed nailing procedures performed in 202 consecutive closed tibial and femoral diaphyseal fractures. Intervention(s):Dosimeter provided to each member of surgical team. Surgeon experience level (trainee, senior registrar, and consultant).Main Outcome Measurements:RE (microsieverts) to the surgical team and FT (minutes) were recorded from the dosimeter and fluoroscopic unit, respectively, and correlated with surgeon's experience. Result(s):In tibial nailing, mean RE (in Sv) per procedure to surgeon, surgical assistant, and scrub nurse was 15.2, 9.2, and 2.0 for trainees, 14.5, 8.1, and 1.6 for senior registrars, and 13.6, 7.4, and 1.5 for consultants, respectively. In femoral nailing, mean RE per procedure to surgeon, surgical assistant, and scrub nurse was 181.6, 113.6, and 37.1 for trainees, 110.1, 66.7, and 20.4 for senior registrars, and 79.9, 30.9, and 12.5 for consultants, respectively. RE to the surgeon was highest followed by surgical assistant and scrub nurse irrespective of operating surgeon's experience in both tibial and femoral nailing (P < 0.001). In tibial nailing, there was a significant difference in FT only for the stage of guide wire passage (P = 0.041), whereas in femoral nailing, total FT (P < 0.001), nail entry verification (P = 0.02), guide wire passage (P = 0.013), nail introduction (P = 0.006), and distal locking (P < 0.001) showed a significant difference. Conclusion(s):RE was maximum for operating surgeon and least for scrub nurse irrespective of operating surgeon's experience in both femoral and tibial nailing. FT and RE to the surgical team decreased with increasing experience of the surgeon in femoral nailing. Level of Evidence:Prognostic Level II.

237,"Disaster preparedness education and a Midwest Regional Poison Center OBJECTIVE: To assess knowledge and comfort related to disaster preparedness and response gained and retained from a disaster medicine workshop given to Certified Specialists in Poison Information (CSPI). DESIGN: A pilot study with a pre-post intervention design. SETTING: A Midwest Regional Poison Center. PARTICIPANTS: All CSPIs employed at the participating Poison Center (N = 27) were recruited. Participation ranged from 44 percent (n = 12) for the 4-month postworkshop knowledge quiz to 78 percent (n = 21) for the preworkshop survey. INTERVENTION: A disaster medicine workshop was given to the CSPIs. Quizzes and surveys were done preworkshop and then repeated at 1 week, 4 months, and 14 months postworkshop. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: CSPI knowledge and comfort pertaining to disaster-related calls. RESULT(S): CSPIs' comfort levels with calls regarding major chemical or nuclear/radiation disasters significantly increased and stayed elevated during all follow-up periods [Kruskal-Wallis chi2 (3) = 13.1, p = 0.01]. The average preworkshop quiz score was 58.2 percent. A statistically significant increase in mean quiz score was demonstrated amongst preworkshop and postworkshop scores at all tested time intervals (F = 18.8, p < 0.001). CONCLUSION(S): CSPIs' knowledge regarding disaster management significantly increased after a disaster medicine workshop, and this knowledge was significantly retained for the 14-month duration of this study. Currently, there are no uniform guidelines for Poison Centers regarding disaster response training. Studies targeted at the development of educational competencies for CSPIs and disaster response would help to standardize this much needed education.",Excluded
2988,"Anthropometric factors and cutaneous melanoma: Prospective data from the population-based Janus Cohort The aim of the present study was to prospectively examine risk of cutaneous melanoma (CM) according to measured anthropometric factors, adjusted for exposure to ultraviolet radiation (UVR), in a large population-based cohort in Norway. The Janus Cohort, including 292,851 Norwegians recruited 1972-2003, was linked to the Cancer Registry of Norway and followed for CM through 2014. Cox regression was used to estimate hazard ratios (HRs) of CM with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Restricted cubic splines were incorporated into the Cox models to assess possible non-linear relationships. All analyses were adjusted for attained age, indicators of UVR exposure, education, and smoking status. During a mean follow-up of 27 years, 3,000 incident CM cases were identified. In men, CM risk was positively associated with body mass index, body surface area (BSA), height and weight (all ptrends < 0.001), and the exposure-response curves indicated an exponential increase in risk for all anthropometric factors. Weight loss of more than 2 kg in men was associated with a 53% lower risk (HR 0.47, 95% CI: 0.39, 0.57). In women, CM risk increased with increasing BSA (ptrend = 0.002) and height (ptrend < 0.001). The shape of the height-CM risk curve indicated an exponential increase. Our study suggests that large body size, in general, is a CM risk factor in men, and is the first to report that weight loss may reduce the risk of CM among men.Copyright © 2017 UICC",Excluded
3027,"Combined use of automatic tube potential selection with tube current modulation and iterative reconstruction technique in coronary CT angiography Purpose: To analyze the effect of automatic tube potential selection with tube current modulation (APSCM) and iterative reconstruction on image quality, diagnostic accuracy, and radiation dose at computed tomographic (CT) angiography and compare it with APSCM-only and body mass index (BMI)-based examination protocols. Material(s) and Method(s): This study was approved by the institutional review board, and informed consent was obtained from all patients. Images from 185 patients who underwent a BMI-based protocol and 197 patients who underwent an APSCM protocol with filtered back projection (FBP) and an APSCM protocol with sinogram-affirmed iterative reconstruction (SAFIRE) were retrospectively evaluated. Diagnostic performance was compared with that of conventional coronary angiography in a subgroup of 51 patients. Statistical analysis was performed by using the independent or paired t test, Mann-Whitney U test, Wilcoxon signed rank test, x2 statistics, linear weighted k statistics, and generalized estimating equation. Result(s): The APSCM group with SAFIRE had a significant reduction in image noise and a significant increase in CT number, contrast enhancement, signal-to-noise ratio, and contrast-to-noise ratio compared with the APSCM group with FBP (P < .0001) and the BMI-based group (P < .001, except P = .002 for image noise). Image quality and diagnostic accuracy showed no significant difference between the three groups. The use of APSCM resulted in a significant reduction in radiation dose compared with the BMI-based protocol. Conclusion(s): The combination of SAFIRE and APSCM at coronary CT angiography significantly improves objective image quality while maintaining diagnostic accuracy and reduced radiation dose. © RSNA, 2013.",Excluded
18,"Clinical usefulness of the novel tag-less Pillcam patency capsule for the screening of patients with suspected small bowel strictures BACKGROUND:Capsule endoscopy (CE) is a non-invasive diagnostic tool for the study of the small bowel. The main complication of CE is capsule retention, defined as a failure to excrete the capsule for 2 weeks or more requiring directed medical, endoscopic, or surgical intervention. Due to the risk of capsule retention, CE is contraindicated in patients with suspected small bowel strictures. The novel tag-less PillCam Patency Capsule (PPC) for preventing capsule retention which was marketed in 2012 in Japan has expanded the indication of small bowel disease for CE. OBJECTIVE(S):We investigated the safety and clinical usefulness of the novel tag-less PillCam Patency Capsule for preventing capsule retention in patients with suspected small bowel strictures. PATIENTS AND METHODS:Sixteen patients who suspected small bowel strictures were included (mean age: 66.2) in this retrospective study. If patients had already excreted the intact PPC in the stool at 30 h after ingestion of PPC, patency of the small bowel was confirmed. If the confirmation at 30 h was not successful, reconfirmation was performed by abdominal X-ray and/or computed tomography (CT) within 33 hours after the ingestion. If the intact PPC had reached to colon, we judged patency"". Except for the above-mentioned, we judged ""no patency"". If patency was established, then the patients underwent CE. RESULT(S):Male/Female (8/8). Clinical indications before the PPC were melena or hematochezia (6), abdominal pain (3), abdominal distension (2), abdominal mass (4) constipation (1), diarrhea (1), anemia (2), no abdominal symptom (4). A history of abdominal surgery +/- (4/12). A history of abdominal irradiation +/- (5/11). Fourteen cases (87.5%) had complete PPC examination followed by CE within 2 weeks. We judged 2 cases ""no patency"". Each of two cases showed the symptoms of ileus. One case needed ileus tube insertion and gastrografin enema showed stricture. In another case, gastric tube was inserted. In both cases, the ileus improved after conservative treatment. Fourteen patients underwent CE following the patency capsule examination. In 10 cases (71.4%) of them, the significant pathologic findings were found by CE. Although the confirmation of the patency by PPC was established, retention occurred in one case with asymptomatic. The patient had prior operation history of ileum-transverse colon bypass. CONCLUSION(S):Passage is a direct proof of the patency of small bowel. The tag-less PillCam Patency Capsule was useful to evaluate the patency of the small bowel to confirm the safer capsule endoscopy in patients with suspected small bowel strictures. However, the PPC itself may show the symptoms of ileus. The cases with abdominal surgical history could be a risk for capsule retention even though PillCam Patency Capsule confirmed the patency.""",Excluded
3697,"Risk of stomach cancer incidence in a cohort of Mayak PA workers occupationally exposed to ionizing radiation Stomach cancer is a widespread health condition associated with environmental and genetic factors. Contribution of ionizing radiation to stomach cancer etiology is not sufficiently studied. This study was aimed to assess an association of the stomach cancer incidence risk with doses from occupational radiation exposure in a cohort of workers hired at main Mayak production association facilities in 1948-1982 taking into account non-radiation factors including digestive disorders. The study cohort comprised 22,377 individuals and by 31.12.2013 343 stomach cancer diagnoses had been reported among the cohort members. Occupational stomach absorbed doses were provided by the Mayak Worker Dosimetry System- 2008 (MWDS-2008) for external gamma ray exposure and by the Mayak Worker Dosimetry System- 2013 (MWDS-2013) for internal exposure to plutonium. Excess relative risks (ERR) per Gy for stomach cancer were estimated using the Poisson's regression. Analyses were run using the AMFIT module of the EPICURE software. The stomach cancer incidence risk in the study cohort was found to be significantly associated with the stomach absorbed dose of gamma rays: ERR/Gy = 0.19 (95% CI: 0.01, 0.44) with a 0 year lag, and ERR/Gy = 0.20 (95% CI: 0.01, 0.45) with a 5 year lag. To estimate the baseline risk, sex, attained age, smoking status and alcohol consumption, chronic diseases (peptic ulcer, gastritis and duodenitis) were taken into account. No modifications of the radiogenic risk by non-radiation factors were found in the study worker cohort. No association of the stomach cancer incidence risk with internal exposure to incorporated plutonium was observed.Copyright: © 2020 Zhuntova et al.

198,"Long-term outcomes after radiosurgery for acoustic neuromas BACKGROUND: Stereotactic radiosurgery is the principal alternative to microsurgical resection for acoustic neuromas (vestibular schwannomas). The goals of radiosurgery are the long-term prevention of tumor growth, maintenance of neurologic function, and prevention of new neurologic deficits. Although acceptable short-term outcomes have been reported, long-term outcomes have not been well documented., METHODS: We evaluated 162 consecutive patients who underwent radiosurgery for acoustic neuromas between 1987 and 1992 by means of serial imaging tests, clinical evaluations, and a survey between 5 and 10 years after the procedure. The average dose of radiation to the tumor margin was 16 Gy, and the mean transverse diameter of the tumor was 22 mm (range, 8 to 39). Resection had been performed previously in 42 patients (26 percent); in 13 patients the tumor represented a recurrence of disease after a previous total resection. Facial function was normal in 76 percent of the patients before radiosurgery, and 20 percent had useful hearing., RESULTS: The rate of tumor control (with no resection required) was 98 percent. One hundred tumors (62 percent) became smaller, 53 (33 percent) remained unchanged in size, and 9 (6 percent) became slightly larger. Resection was performed in four patients (2 percent) within four years after radiosurgery. Normal facial function was preserved in 79 percent of the patients after five years (House-Brackmann grade 1), and normal trigeminal function was preserved in 73 percent. Fifty-one percent of the patients had no change in hearing ability. No new neurologic deficits appeared more than 28 months after radiosurgery. An outcomes questionnaire was returned by 115 patients (77 percent of the 149 patients still living). Fifty-four of these patients (47 percent) were employed at the time of radiosurgery, and 37 (69 percent) remained so. Radiosurgery was believed to have been successful by all 30 patients who had undergone surgery previously and by 81 (95 percent) of the 85 who had not. Thirty-six of the 115 patients (31 percent) described at least one complication, which resolved in 56 percent of those cases., CONCLUSIONS: Radiosurgery can provide long-term control of acoustic neuromas while preserving neurologic function.",Included
1073,"Mesenchymal stem cell therapy for cutaneous radiation syndrome Systemic and local radiation injuries caused by nuclear power reactor accidents, therapeutic irradiation, or nuclear terrorism should be prevented or properly treated in order to improve wound management and save lives. Currently, regenerative surgical modalities should be attempted with temporal artificial dermis impregnated and sprayed with a local angiogenic factor such as basic fibroblast growth factor, and secondary reconstruction can be a candidate for demarcation and saving the donor morbidity. Human mesenchymal stem cells and adipose-derived stem cells, together with angiogenic and mitogenic factor of basic fibroblast growth factor and an artificial dermis, were applied over the excised irradiated skin defect and were tested for differentiation and local stimulation effects in the radiation-exposed wounds. The perforator flap and artificial dermal template with growth factor were successful for reconstruction in patients who were suffering from complex underlying disease. Patients were uneventfully treated with minimal morbidities. In the experiments, the hMSCs are strongly proliferative even after 20 Gy irradiation in vitro. In vivo, 4 Gy rat whole body irradiation demonstrated that sustained marrow stromal (mesenchymal stem) cells survived in the bone marrow. Immediate artificial dermis application impregnated with cells and the cytokine over the 20 Gy irradiated skin and soft tissues demonstrated the significantly improved fat angiogenesis, architected dermal reconstitution, and less inflammatory epidermal recovery. Detailed understanding of underlying diseases and rational reconstructive procedures brings about good outcomes for difficult irradiated wound healing. Adipose-derived stem cells are also implicated in the limited local injuries for short cell harvesting and processing time in the same subject. Copyright © 2010 Health Physics Society.",Included
1833,"Utility of new bioabsorptive screws in cervical anterior fusion Background: The aim of this study is to report our use of new bioabsorbable screws in cervical anterior fusion. These screws need not be removed because they are completely absorbed by resolution in vivo. We describe our method and the new bioabsorbable screws. Method(s): We used PLLA screws until September 2004 and uncalcined uHA-PLLA screws thereafter. They are completely absorbed by resolution to water and carbon dioxide upon in vivo hydrolysis. The uHA-PLLA screws are x-ray impenetrable, and their uHA content renders them osteoconductive. In cervical anterior fusion, the graft is inserted in the area of deletion resulting from decompression. The screws are inserted in the 4 corners of the vertebral body and graft. In long fusion, they are introduced in the 2 lateral wings of the bone graft on each vertebral body and in the 4 corners. Our method eliminates the need for plates or mesh. Result(s): We have used this method in 62 patients and encountered no complications. There were no screw or graft extrusions and no surgery-related infections. The patients were able to walk a few hours after the operation and wore a simple neck collar for a few days. Conclusion(s): This safe and easy method shortens the hospital stay and reduces the risk of graft extrusion and complications associated with the use of nonabsorbable devices. © 2007 Elsevier Inc.

Patients who received radiation therapy had no clearance of saccharin from the nasal cavity at a minimum of 20 minutes. The controls had a median clearance time of 5 minutes. The patients noted a higher prevalence of nasal congestion, drainage, and facial pain after radiation therapy. This study demonstrates that radiation therapy to the nasal cavity causes a decrease in nasal mucociliary clearance.

453,"Utility of postoperative radiographs for cervical spine fusion: A comprehensive evaluation of operative technique, surgical indication, and duration since surgery STUDY DESIGN.: A retrospective study. OBJECTIVE.: To assess the utility of postoperative radiographs in patients across a spectrum of cervical fusion procedures, surgical indication, and time since surgery. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA.: Postoperative radiographs are routinely obtained after cervical spine fusion despite lack of evidence supporting such practice. Studies assessing postoperative radiographical utility in the cervical spine have been limited. To date, no study has comprehensively evaluated the utility of obtaining such radiographs across multiple cervical fusion procedures. METHODS.: A total of 972 clinic notes from 301 patients during a 10-year period at a single institution were retrospectively reviewed. Patients in this study underwent an anterior cervical discectomy and fusion, anterior corpectomy and fusion, a combined anterior cervical discectomy and fusion and anterior corpectomy and fusion (hybrid), posterior spine fusion, or 360degree fusion. All postoperative clinic notes and radiographs were reviewed for abnormalities and changes in treatment course. It was determined whether an abnormal radiograph alone led to a change in treatment course among the various operative techniques, surgical indication, or time since surgery. RESULTS.: No statistical significant difference in radiograph utility between anterior cervical discectomy and fusion (0 changes in treatment course due to radiograph alone out of 332 clinic notes), anterior corpectomy and fusion (0 of 140), hybrid procedure (1 of 72), posterior spine fusion (5 of 357), and 360degree fusion (0 of 71) was found. Surgical indication (trauma vs. degeneration) and duration from surgery yielded no statistical significant difference in radiograph utility. The overall sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values of radiographs were 33.8%, 87.6%, 19.0%, and 93.9%, respectively. CONCLUSION.: Regardless of operative techniques performed, surgical indication, and time since surgery, routine postoperative radiographs provide low utility in guiding treatment course in asymptomatic patients. Although radiographs may provide important diagnostic utility in certain individual cases, the results of this study provide further evidence that radiographs should not be considered routine during postoperative visits, thus minimizing unnecessary radiation exposure and medical costs.

2661,"Intravenous contrast agent influence on thoracic computed tomography simulation investigated through a heterogeneous dose calculation method using 5-Bulk densities Objective: Using 5-bulk-density heterogeneous dose calculation, we investigated whether contrast-enhanced (CE+) computed tomography (CT) will affect dose-calculation accuracy in the thoracic area. Method(s): We analyzed 17 radiation-oncology patients who underwent thoracic CE+ CTs. Full-resolution CT and 5-bulk-density plans were generated using an adaptive convolution algorithm. Bulk densities for air, lung, fat, soft tissue, and bone were applied to regions identified by an isodensity segmentation tool. The population-averaged physical density of each region was calculated and compared with the reference value calculated from 66 noncontrast-enhanced (CE-) thoracic CT images. Using the 5-bulk densities, we created a new plan in which the physical densities of each area were forced to be the same as the CE- reference value, and we compared the dose-volume histograms (DVH). Result(s): Average physical density for the segmented air, lung, fat, soft tissue, and bone for CE+ were 0.14, 0.29, 0.90, 1.03, and 1.13 g/cm3, and the reference values for CE- were 0.14, 0.26, 0.89, 1.02, and 1.12 g/cm3, respectively. In all the cases, the normal-tissue DVH agreed to better than 1%. In 15 cases, DVH of the planning target volume (PTV) agreed to better than 3%. In 2 patients, >3% difference in the PTV dose was observed. Conclusion(s): Only 2 patients with a strong injection artifact in the PTV or beam showed >3% discrepancy in the target dose.

Parameters (TD(50), n, and m) of the LKB NTCP model predicting for>grade 2 AE (RTOG grading) were identified using maximum likelihood analysis. Univariate and multivariate analyses using a binary regression logistic model were performed to identify patient, tumor and dosimetric predictors of AE., RESULTS: Grade 2 or 3 AE occurred in 24% and 52% of pts in group 1 and 2, respectively (p<0.001). For the 93 group 1 pts, the fitted LKB model parameters were: m=0.15, n=0.29 and TD(50)=46 Gy. For the 64 group 2 pts, the parameters were: m=0.42, n=0.09 and TD(50)=36 Gy. In multivariate analysis, the only significant predictors of AE were: NTCP (p<0.001) and V(50), as continuous variable (RR=1.03, p=0.03) or being more than a threshold value of 11% (RR=3.6, p=0.009)., CONCLUSIONS: A LKB NTCP model has been established to predict AE in a Chinese population, receiving thoracic RT, alone or combined with CT. The parameters of the models appear slightly different than the previous one described in Western countries, with a lower volume effect for Chinese patients. Copyright © 2010 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

2502,"Cytogenetic assessment of heterogeneous radiation doses in cancer patients treated with fractionated radiotherapy The purpose of this study was to evaluate the in vivo dose-response relation of chromosome aberration formation and distribution in a context of localised and fractionated radiotherapy. Cytogenetic analysis was applied to eight patients, all treated for the same tumour localisation; the same localisation was used to prevent the variability usually observed between patients treated with radiotherapy and to allow the corresponding roles of the size of irradiation field and of the dose rate to be studied. The yield of dicentrics, centric rings and fragments was measured in blood samples taken before treatment, during the course of radiotherapy and up to 6 months after. After the first fraction of radiotherapy, we observed that the whole-body dose estimated from the yield of dicentrics and rings was higher (0.35+/-0.2 Gy) than the calculated equivalent whole-body dose (0.07+/-0.04 Gy). By contrast, the partial-body dose derived from the Qdr (quotient of dicentrics and rings) model was estimated to be 2.2+/-0.3 Gy, which agreed quite well with the dose delivered to the tumour (2.1+/-0.1 Gy). We also found a correlation between the yield of induced chromosome aberrations and the target field size (p = 0.014). U-value analysis showed that the distribution of dicentrics and rings was overdispersed, despite the fractionation of the exposure, and a positive correlation between the U-value and the dose rate was observed (p = 0.017). Overall, these results suggest that the proportion of undamaged lymphocytes could increase with the dose rate.",Excluded

A thermolucent digital dosimeter was worn at chest level without a lead apron. Dosimeter readings and distance from the spine surgeon were recorded. RESULTS .: Average surgeon exposure was 44.22 +/- 17.4 murem (range: 17.71-70.76 murem). The mean distance from the O-ARM was 4.56 +/- .32 m, and the surgeon was exposed for an average of 19.6 +/- 5.7 seconds (range: 8.05-28.7 s). The annual number of necessary procedures required to surpass the exposure limit, according to the data presented here, would be 113,071 operations using O-ARM. Hence, the number of necessary procedures for O-ARM use is predicted to be 1,130,710 annual procedures to reach the occupational exposure limits for extremity, skin, and all other organs and 339,213 procedures to reach the limits for the lens of eye., CONCLUSION: Radiation exposure is minimal to the surgical team during routine use of the O-ARM imaging system. The number of procedures required to surpass occupational exposure limits is high if using appropriate distance from the O-ARM.",Excluded
48,"The relationship between occupational radiation exposure and thyroid nodules Background: Considering that thyroid nodules and thyroid cancer occur more frequently in people chronically exposed to radiation, the aim of this study was to evaluate the prevalence of thyroid nodules in a population occupationally exposed to radiation in hospitals of Isfahan, Iran. Material(s) and Method(s): In this case-control study, the prevalence of thyroid nodules in staff members occupationally exposed to radiation was determined by ultrasonography. The results were compared with the results of another study among the adult population of Isfahan which selected by cluster random sampling method. The 2 studied groups were matched according to sex and age. Result(s): The case and control groups included 124 and 471 persons, respectively. The prevalence of thyroid nodules in the case and control groups was 22.6% and 24.6%, respectively (p > 0.05). Although thyroid nodules were significantly more prevalent in females in the control group, no such difference was observed between females and males of the case group (p > 0.05). The number of thyroid nodules (single or multiple) and calcification were not different between the two groups (p > 0.05). In addition, hypoechogenicity of thyroid nodules was not different between the two groups for (p > 0.05). Conclusion(s): In our study, there was not any correlation between chronic occupational exposure to low dose of radiation and the risk of developing thyroid nodules. Further studies with larger sample sizes, at different doses of radiation, and considering iodine status and thyroid function are thus required.",Included
2673,"Biological effects of low-dose chest CT on chromosomal DNA Background: Although the National Lung Screening Trial reported a significant reduction in lung cancer mortality when low-dose (LD) CT chest examinations are used for a diagnosis, their biologic effects from radiation exposure remain unclear. Purpose(s): To compare LD CT and standard-dose (SD) CT for DNA double-strand breaks and chromosome aberrations (CAs) in peripheral blood lymphocytes. Material(s) and Method(s): Between March 2016 and June 2018, 209 participants who were referred to a respiratory surgery department for chest CT studies were prospectively enrolled in this study. Individuals were excluded if they had undergone radiography examinations within the last 3 days or had undergone chemotherapy or radiation therapy. Peripheral blood samples were obtained before and 15 minutes after CT. The number of g-H2AX foci and unstable CAs in lymphocytes was quantified by immunofluorescent staining of g-H2AX and by fluorescence in situ hybridization by using peptide nucleic acid probes for centromeres and telomeres, respectively. The Wilcoxon signed rank test was used for statistical analysis. Bonferroni correction was applied for multiple comparisons. Result(s): Of the 209 participants (105 women, 104 men; mean age, 67.0 years 6 11.3 [standard deviation]), 107 underwent chest LD CT and 102 underwent chest SD CT. Sex distribution, age, and body size metrics were similar between the two groups. The median effective dose of LD CT and SD CT was 1.5 and 5.0 mSv, respectively. The number of double-strand breaks and CAs increased after a SD CT examination (g-H2AX, P , .001; CAs, P = .003); the number of double-strand breaks and CAs before and after LD CT was not different (g-H2AX, P = .45; CAs, P = .69). Conclusion(s): No effect of low-dose CT on human DNA was detected. In the same setting, DNA double-strand breaks and chromosome aberrations increased after standard-dose CT.Copyright © RSNA, 2020.",Included

Attenuation values of abdominal organs and image noise were measured, and the contrast-to-noise ratios (CNRs) were calculated. Subjective image quality was assessed by three independent radiologists. Radiation exposure was assessed by size-specific dose estimate (SSDE)., RESULTS: The mean attenuation of the kidney increased by 20% at 100 kVp (p<0.0001), and the mean image noise was 27% higher in the 100 kVp (p=0.003). The CNR did not significantly differ between the groups (120 kVp, 6.6+/-2.8; 100 kVp, 7.4+/-3.6; p=0.26). Except for subjective image noise (p<0.001), no other subjective quality parameters (e.g., contrast, artefacts) were significantly different between the two groups (p between 0.094 and 0.761). The mean SSDE in the 100-kVp group (9.8+/-1.8 mGy) was reduced by 19% compared to the 120-kVp group (12.1+/-1.8 mGy; p<0.0001)., CONCLUSION: Manual reduction of tube voltage from the standard 120 to 100 kVp for portal-venous phase CT in patients with body weights <=75 kg resulted in a 19% dose reduction while maintaining objective and subjective image quality.

941,"Age at exposure to ionising radiation and cancer mortality among Hanford workers: Follow up through 1994 Background: Studies of workers at the plutonium production factory in Hanford, WA have led to conflicting conclusions about the role of age at exposure as a modifier of associations between ionising radiation and cancer. Aim(s): To evaluate the influence of age at exposure on radiation risk estimates in an updated follow up of Hanford workers. Method(s): A cohort of 26 389 workers hired between 1944 and 1978 was followed through 1994 to ascertain vital status and causes of death. External radiation dose estimates were derived from personal dosimeters. Poisson regression was used to estimate associations between mortality and cumulative external radiation dose at all ages, and in specific age ranges. Result(s): A total of 8153 deaths were identified, 2265 of which included cancer as an underlying or contributory cause. Estimates of the excess relative risk per Sievert (ERR/Sv) for cumulative radiation doses at all ages combined were negative for all cause and leukaemia and positive for all cancer and lung cancer. Cumulative doses accrued at ages below 35, 35-44, and 45-54 showed little association with mortality. For cumulative dose accrued at ages 55 and above (10 year lag), the estimated ERR/Sv for all cancers was 3.24 (90% CI: 0.80 to 6.17), primarily due to an association with lung cancer (ERR/Sv. 9.05, 90% CI: 2.96 to 17.92). Conclusion(s): Associations between radiation and cancer mortality in this cohort are primarily a function of doses at older ages and deaths from lung cancer. The association of older age radiation exposures and cancer mortality is similar to observations from several other occupational studies.",Included

The management of incomplete excision remains undecided with post-operative radiotherapy advocated by some and observation by others., METHODS: 190 patients who underwent resection of PSA of the parotid gland within the West of Scotland region from 1981 to 2008 were identified and data collected., RESULTS: 78/190 patients had a primary incomplete excision. 25/78 received post-operative radiotherapy and 53 were observed. Recurrences occurred in 11/53 in those observed and in 1/25 of those who received radiotherapy. 21/25 complained of significant side effects from the radiotherapy. 38 surgeons performed 190 procedures, with a range of experience from 1 to28 procedures., CONCLUSIONS: Radiotherapy does appear to reduce recurrence with incomplete excision, however it is associated with significant side effects. We therefore feel radiotherapy should not be routinely recommended. Subspecialisation should be adopted to increase the operating surgeon's experience.

Conventional treatments include parent vessel occlusion, endovascular coiling or covered stenting. Use of the Pipeline embolization device (PED) for pseudoaneurysm exclusion at the skull base is not well described. Objective To report the clinical and angiographic outcome after using multiple PEDs to treat recently ruptured radiation-induced carotid pseudoaneurysms at the skull base. Methods Retrospective review of the clinical and angiographic records of patients who received PEDs as primary treatment for skull base carotid pseudoaneurysm between April 1, 2011 to March 31, 2013. Results Seven patients (five men, two women) with a mean age of 58 years (range 47-65) were treated in the study period. Primary treatment with the PED alone, with adjunct coil embolization in two patients, achieved immediate hemostasis in all patients, with no pseudoaneurysm rebleeding after a mean follow-up of 15.3 months (range 4-24 months). One patient had periprocedural cerebral infarction. Delayed internal carotid artery occlusion secondary to in-stent thrombosis occurred in three patients, one of whom had lacunar infarct and two remained asymptomatic. Conclusions Endovascular treatment with the PED was effective in excluding skull base post-irradiated carotid pseudoaneurysms and preventing recurrent blowout. However, the risk of ischemic complications in this group of patients was high and our experience did not support the use of flow diverters as a first-line treatment for this condition.",Excluded

The predominant primary site was the oral cavity in 24 patients (51%), 27 had nodal disease with extracapsular extension, and 26 had positive or close mucosal margins (<5 mm). Ten patients had undergone resection of recurrent disease after previous surgery. Twenty-seven (57%) were treated with cisplatin, and the remaining patients received carboplatin because of contraindications to cisplatin. The median radiotherapy dose was 60 Gy (range, 50-66 Gy). Of the 47 patients, 45 (96%) completed at least four of the six planned doses of chemotherapy and 45 (96%) completed the planned course of radiotherapy. Nineteen patients (40%) had confluent mucositis, eight (17%) had Grade 3-4 hematologic toxicity, and four (9%) had febrile neutropenia. No treatment-related deaths occurred. The estimated 2-year locoregional control, progression-free survival, and overall survival rate was 73%, 56%, and 62%, respectively. Excluding the 10 patients with recurrence after previous surgery, the locoregional control, progression-free survival, and overall survival rate was 81%, 64%, and 71%, respectively. Five cases of Grade 3-4 late treatment-related sequelae developed., CONCLUSION: Treatment with postoperative concurrent weekly cisplatin or carboplatin and radiotherapy was reasonably well tolerated. Acute and late toxicity was acceptable. The overall results achieved are comparable with the preliminary results of recent randomized trials.

1593,"Development of Simple Methods to Reduce the Exposure of the Public to Radiation from Patients Who Have Undergone 18F-FDG PET/CT At a time when reducing the radiation dose to patients and the public has become a major focus, we assessed the radiation exposure rate from patients after an 18F-FDG PET/CT scan and evaluated different interventions to reduce it. Methods: We enrolled 100 patients, divided into 2 groups. For both groups, the radiation dose rate was measured with an ionization survey meter immediately after the scan. For group 1, the patients then voided and their dose rate was measured again. For group 2, the patients waited 30 min before voiding, and we measured the dose rate before (group 2A) and after (group 2B) they voided. Results: In total, 74 of the 100 patients exceeded the 20 muSv/h (2 mR/h) threshold immediately after the scan. In group 1, the mean dose rate decreased by 20.0% from the postscan measurement, with 12 of 36 remaining at or above 20 muSv/h. In group 2A, the mean dose rate decreased by 23% from the postscan measurement, with 9 of 38 remaining at or above 20 muSv/h. In group 2B, the mean dose rate decreased by 35% from the postscan measurement, with 1 of 38 remaining at 20 muSv/h. Conclusion: Nearly 75% of patients undergoing an 18F-FDG PET/CT scan exceed 20 muSv/h when leaving the imaging facility. The most effective method to reduce radiation exposure was to have the patient void 30 min after the examination. Copyright © 2020 by the Society of Nuclear Medicine and Molecular Imaging.",Excluded
3213,"Heavy ion radiotherapy in lung cancer (Introduction) In radiotherapy of nonsmall cell lung cancer (NSCLC), carbon ion beams offer improved dose distributions as compared to photon beams and thus enable dose escalation within a target while sparing the surrounding normal tissues. Furthermore, carbon ions being heavier than protons provide a higher biological effectiveness, which increases with depth, reaching the maximum at the end of the range. At the National Institute of Radiological Sciences (NIRS), clinical research on carbon ion radiotherapy (C-ion RT) was started in 1994 using carbon-ions generated by Heavy Ion Medical Accelerator in Chiba (HIMAC). So far, almost 6,000 patients have been treated, where the benefit of C-ion RT over other modalities has been demonstrated in terms of high local control rates and a significant reduction in overall treatment time with acceptable toxicities in most cases. In this paper, the results of treatment for Stage I NSCLC using 9 and 4 fractions are reviewed, as well as preliminary results of single fraction treatment is described. Also, results of other RT reported in the literatures are compared. (Methods and materials) Stage I lung cancer is divided into two types depending on tumor location: peripheral-type and central-type. This classification is made on the assumption that the two types may tolerate radiation differently. Therefore, different fractionation regimens were investigated for each type. The patients eligible for either treatment are those for whom surgery was not indicated due to medical reasons or refusal. From 1999 to 2003, a total of 131 tumors in129 patients received C-ion RT with 9 fractions and 4 fractions, including 94 males and 37 females with an average age of 74.5 years. Out of the 131 foci, there were 72 T1 tumors and 59 T2 tumors. There were 85 adenocarcinomas, 43 epidermoid cancers and 3 other types. Regarding dose fractionations, 51 cases were treated with 72.0GyE/9 fractions, and 80 cases were treated with 52.8GyE/4fr for stage IA and 60.0GyE/4fr for stage IB. Since 2003, a doseescalation study using single fraction treatment has been conducted for peripheral-type NSCLC. The initial dose was 28.0 GyE, which was then escalated at increments of 5%. At each dose level, about 10 to 30 patients were registered for evaluation of toxicity and local control with carbon ions. C-ion RT has also been applied to locally advanced lung cancers and hilar-type cancers, and case studies are being accumulated. The locally advanced lung cancers included Pancoast tumors and mediastinal-type tumors in stages II-IIIA. (Results) All of the patients treated with 9 fractions/3 weeks (50 patients) and 4 fractions/1 week (79 patients) developed no evidence of severe toxicities. The 5-year local control rates were 98.6% for stage-IA cases and 89.7% for stage- IB cases, and the 5-year survival rates were 63.1% for stage-IA cases and 50.0% for stage-IB cases. In single fraction treatment, a total of 218 patients have been registered, in which the total dose has been escalated from 28.0 to 48.0 GyE. So far, no serious adverse events have been observed, and local control appears to be improving with increasing total dose. For skin reactions, six grade 2 toxicity (3.3%) but no grade 3 or higher was observed. For radiation pneumonitis, only one grade 1 was reported, and no toxicities greater than grade 2 occurred. The overall local control rate was 91.8%, and the causespeci fic survival rate at 5-years was 71.8%. The superficial lesions arising at the hilar region have been successfully treated with acceptable toxicities. Similarly, in the preoperative radiotherapy for patients with chest wall invasion, high anti-tumor effect was confirmed in the pathological findings after the lung was surgically removed. (Discussion) Only at NIRS, Japan, NSCLC has been treated with carbon ions. For peripheral tumor, we have been conducting clinical studies to establish a short-course, hypo-fractionated radiotherapy. We first performed a dose-escalation study using 18 fractions/6 weeks. The number of fractions and treatment times were subsequently reduced to 9 fractions over 3 weeks, 4 fractions over one week, and eventually to a single fraction treatment. The preliminary data suggested favorable local control and very few toxic reactions with a median follow up time of about 16 months. Compared with pulmonary damage reported for stereotactic radiotherapy in stage I lung cancer, the incidence and severity in our patients seemed to be remarkably low. The decreased adverse effects on the lung are likely achieved due to the small volume irradiated. When comparing proton vs C-ion RT, local control results are comparable for T1 tumors, but for T2 tumors 2-5 year local control rates are higher in C-ion RT. It is of note that in most reported data for proton therapy, follow-up periods are short relative to the time required for full evaluation of TCP, late NTCP and survival. Considering that the average age of the patients receiving C-ion RT was about 75 years, about 10 years older than that of 65 years in the operated patients, the results of C-ion RT for stage-I lung cancer may be comparable to surgical results. Thus, the single-fraction irradiation method may be described as the ultimate type of treatment using carbon ion, and would be a valid alternative to surgery, especially for elderly and inoperable patients.",Excluded

1800,"A prospective study comparing the predictions of doctors versus models for treatment outcome of lung cancer patients: a step toward individualized care and shared decision making BACKGROUND: Decision Support Systems, based on statistical prediction models, have the potential to change the way medicine is being practiced, but their application is currently hampered by the astonishing lack of impact studies. Showing the theoretical benefit of using these models could stimulate conductance of such studies. In addition, it would pave the way for developing more advanced models, based on genomics, proteomics and imaging information, to further improve the performance of the models., PURPOSE: In this prospective single-center study, previously developed and validated statistical models were used to predict the two-year survival (2yrS), dyspnea (DPN), and dysphagia (DPH) outcomes for lung cancer patients treated with chemo radiation. These predictions were compared to probabilities provided by doctors and guideline-based recommendations currently used. We hypothesized that model predictions would significantly outperform predictions from doctors., MATERIALS AND METHODS: Experienced radiation oncologists (ROs) predicted all outcomes at two timepoints: (1) after the first consultation of the patient, and (2) after the radiation treatment plan was made. Differences in the performances of doctors and models were assessed using Area Under the Curve (AUC) analysis., RESULTS: A total number of 155 patients were included. At timepoint #1 the differences in AUCs between the ROs and the models were 0.15, 0.17, and 0.20 (for 2yrS, DPN, and DPH, respectively), with p-values of 0.02, 0.07, and 0.03. Comparable differences at timepoint #2 were not statistically significant due to the limited number of patients. Comparison to guideline-based recommendations also favored the models., CONCLUSION: The models substantially outperformed ROs' predictions and guideline-based recommendations currently used in clinical practice. Identification of risk groups on the basis of the models facilitates individualized treatment, and should be further investigated in clinical impact studies. Copyright © 2014 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

Method We analysed 170 patients treated with Gamma Knife radiosurgery, recorded the evolution of visual acuity and complication rates, and compared their survival with 620 patients treated with eye enucleation. Different peripheral doses (using the 50% therapeutic isodose) were employed: 50-70 Gy for 24 patients, 45 Gy for 71 patients, 35 Gy for 62 patients. Findings There was no significant difference in survival between the 35-Gy, 45-Gy and 50- to 70-Gy groups when compared between themselves (p00.168) and with the enucleation group (p00.454). The 5-year survival rates were: 64% for 35 Gy, 62.71% for 45 Gy, 63.6% for 50-70 Gy and 65.2% for enucleated patients. Clinical variables influencing survival for radiosurgery patients were tumour volume (p00.014) and location (median 66.4 vs 37.36 months for juxtapapillary vs peripheral tumours, respectively; p00.001), while age and gender did not prove significant. Regarding complications, using 35 Gy led to more than a 50% decrease, when compared with the 45-Gy dose, in the incidence of cataract, glaucoma and retinal detachment. Retinopathy, optic neuropathy and vitreous haemorrhage were not significantly influenced. Blindness decreased dramatically from 83.7% for 45 Gy to 31.4% for 35 Gy (p00.006), as well as postradiosurgery enucleation: 23.9% for 45 Gy vs 6.45% for 35 Gy (p00.018).

135,"Simulator training reduces radiation exposure and improves trainees' performance in placing electrophysiologic catheters during patient-based procedures Background: Currently, training in interventional electrophysiology is based on conventional methodologies, and a paucity of data on the usefulness of simulation in this field is available. Objective(s): The purpose of this study was to evaluate the impact of simulator training on trainees' performance in electrophysiologic catheter placement during the early phase of their learning curve. Method(s): Inexperienced electrophysiology fellows were considered. A hybrid high-fidelity simulator (Procedicus VIST, version 7.0, Mentice AB Gothenburg, Sweden for Biosense Webster) was used. The following parameters were evaluated in 3 consecutive patient-based procedures before and after two training sessions of at least 1.5 hours on the simulator: (1) ability to place catheters in conventional recording/pacing sites (coronary sinus, His-bundle area, high right atrium, and right ventricular apex); (2) amount of help provided by the supervisor (scale from 1-3; 3 for maximal help); (3) fluoroscopy time; and (4) positioning time. Result(s): Seven fellows performed 168 catheter placements during 42 patient-based procedures with no complications. Comparing parameters before and after simulator training, there was a significant reduction in the mean amount of help and in fluoroscopy and positioning times per placement: from 1.71 +/- 1.24 to 0.42 +/- 0.68 (P <.001), from 121 +/- 88 seconds to 76 +/- 54 seconds (P <.001), and from 175 +/- 138 seconds to 102 +/- 74 seconds (P <.001), respectively. Overall fluoroscopy time per patient decreased from 567 +/- 220 seconds to 305 +/- 111 seconds (P <.0001). Improvement appeared to be related to simulator training alone and not to the previously performed patient-based procedures.

We investigated the role of radiation therapists as key personnel for collecting daily pain scores to supplement assessments by physician and oncology nursing staff and manage pain more effectively during radiation treatment. Methods and Materials: Daily pain scores were obtained by the radiation therapists for 89 patients undertaking a total of 124 courses of EBRT for bone metastases and compared with pretreatment pain scores. The majority of patients (71%) were treated to 30 Gy (range, 20-37.5) in 10 fractions (range, 8-15 fractions). Result(s): One hundred nineteen treatment courses (96%) were completed. Pain scores declined rapidly to 37.5%, 50%, and 75% of the pretreatment levels by Days 2, 4, and 10, respectively. Pain was improved in 91% of patients with only 4% of worse pain at the end of treatment. Improved pain scores were maintained in 83% of patients at 1-month follow-up, but in 35% of them, the pain was worse than at the end of treatment. Conclusion(s): Collection of daily pain scores by radiation therapists was associated with an effective reduction in pain scores early on during EBRT of painful osseous metastases. © 2010 Elsevier Inc.

1173,"A preliminary study of the use of ultrasound in defining nasal fractures: Criteria for a confident diagnosis Nasal fractures are usually diagnosed by clinical examination, with or without the support of imaging studies. While plain-film radiography lacks sensitivity and specificity for diagnosing nasal fractures, and computed tomography (CT) is not always practical or cost-effective, ultrasonography (US) may be useful in this regard. The criteria by which adult nasal fractures are reliably identified on US must be clear. We conducted a preliminary prospective, controlled, observational study to define the appearance of nasal fractures on US. We used US to image 12 patients with a clinical or radiologic (CT or x-ray) diagnosis of nasal fracture. All patients presented within 2 weeks of their injury. For comparison purposes, we also obtained US images from 12 control subjects who had no history of nasal trauma or surgery. We found that we could confidently diagnose nasal fractures on lateral-view US on the basis of a disruption of bone continuity and/or displacement of fracture segments. However, our findings were not as consistent with dorsal-view US, and we do not believe it is adequate for diagnosis. We conclude that lateral US can be used to detect nasal fractures in adults, but further studies are needed to assess its sensitivity, specificity, cost-effectiveness, and practicality.",Excluded

2112,"Outcome and complications of distal tibia fractures treated with intramedullary nails versus minimally invasive plate osteosynthesis and the role of fibula fixation Introduction: Distal tibia fractures have been managed conservatively as well surgically. A large number of implants have been used for surgical management of these fractures. No treatment method or implant has been proven to be superior to others. In this prospective comparative study, the complications and outcome of distal tibia fractures managed with intramedullary nails and minimally invasive plate osteosynthesis has been compared. Further, the role of fibula fixation in these fractures has been evaluated. Material(s) and Method(s): One hundred and fifty-four patients of distal tibia fractures with concomitant fibula fractures were randomized into 4 treatment groups based on predetermined inclusion criteria. Functional outcome in these groups was compared based on AOFAS score at 1 year. Intra-operative, post-operative parameters as well as radiological alignment, complications and the need for reoperation were also compared in these groups. Result(s): The functional outcome in all four treatment groups was similar. The duration of surgery and radiation exposure was higher with minimally invasive plate osteosynthesis. There was no improvement in outcome with plating of fibula. However, fixation of fibula improved the rotational alignment in distal tibia fractures. Conclusion(s): Although there is no difference in outcome of distal tibia fractures with either nailing or minimally invasive plating, nailing is recommended for closed displaced extraarticular fractures. Fixation of fibula should not be done routinely but should be reserved only for a few specific fracture patterns.Copyright © 2020, Springer-Verlag France SAS, part of Springer Nature.",Excluded
1452,"Detection of unwarranted CT radiation exposure from patient and imaging protocol meta-data using regularized regression Background: Variability in radiation exposure from CT scans can be appropriate and driven by patient features such as body habitus. Quantitative analysis may be performed to discover instances of unwarranted radiation exposure and to reduce the probability of such occurrences in future patient visits. No universal process to perform identification of outliers is widely available, and access to expertise and resources is variable. Objective(s): The goal of this study is to develop an automated outlier detection procedure to identify all scans with an unanticipated high radiation exposure, given the characteristics of the patient and the type of the exam. Material(s) and Method(s): This Institutional Review Board-approved retrospective cohort study was conducted from June 30, 2012 - December 31, 2013 in a quaternary academic medical center. The de-identified dataset contained 28 fields for 189,959 CT exams. We applied the variable selection method Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) to select important variables for predicting CT radiation dose. We then employed a regression approach that is robust to outliers, to learn from data a predictive model of CT radiation doses given important variables identified by LASSO. Patient visits whose predicted radiation dose was statistically different from the radiation dose actually received were identified as outliers. Result(s): Our methodology identified 1% of CT exams as outliers. The top-5 predictors discovered by LASSO and strongly correlated with radiation dose were Tube Current, kVp, Weight, Width of collimator, and Reference milliampere-seconds. A human expert validation of the outlier detection algorithm has yielded specificity of 0.85 [95% CI 0.78-0.92]and sensitivity of 0.91 [95% CI 0.85-0.97](PPV = 0.84, NPV = 0.92). These values substantially outperform alternative methods we tested (F1 score 0.88 for our method against 0.51 for the alternatives). Conclusion(s): The study developed and tested a novel, automated method for processing CT scanner meta-data to identify CT exams where patients received an unwarranted amount of radiation. Radiation safety and protocol review committees may use this technique to uncover systemic issues and reduce future incidents.Copyright © 2019 The Authors",Excluded
318,"Prospective Pilot Study of Consolidation Chemotherapy With Docetaxel and Cisplatin After Concurrent Chemoradiotherapy for Advanced Head and Neck Cancer Purpose: With the improvement concurrent chemoradiotherapy (CCRT) in the management of patients with locoregionally advanced head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC), distant failures have become a more relevant problem in terms of survival. The primary objective of this Phase II study is to assess the feasibility of docetaxel and cisplatin consolidation after primary CCRT for patients with HNSCC. Methods and Materials: Patients with locoregionally advanced HNSCC received chemotherapy with three cycles of cisplatin, 100 mg/m2, on Days 1, 22, and 43. Concurrent radiotherapy to the primary tumor and neck was given in a daily dose of 2 Gy to a total dose of 70-70.2 Gy over 7 weeks. After completion of CCRT, patients without evidence of disease progression received an additional four cycles of consolidation chemotherapy with docetaxel, 75 mg/m2, and cisplatin, 75 mg/m2, every 3 weeks. Result(s): Of 33 patients, 27 (81%) completed CCRT. After CCRT, three complete and 19 partial responses were recorded, giving an overall response rate of 67%. Of 19 patients who went to the consolidation phase, only 4 (21%) received all four cycles of docetaxel and cisplatin. Causes of failure of consolidation chemotherapy were toxicity in 11 patients, including three treatment-related deaths, and progression in 4 patients. Three patients died of sepsis during the consolidation phase. Median survival was 11 months for all patients and 8 months for those treated with consolidation chemotherapy. Conclusion(s): The poor compliance and high incidence of severe toxicities prompted no further evaluation of this consolidation chemotherapy after CCRT. © 2008 Elsevier Inc.

2363,"Brugia malayi: effects of gamma radiation on adult worms and their intracellular Wolbachia bacteria Prior studies have shown that intracellular Wolbachia endobacteria are necessary for the normal development, reproduction, and survival of filarial nematodes. The purpose of this study was to examine effects of gamma radiation on Wolbachia and reproduction in Brugia malayi adult worms. Worms were exposed to 0, 10, 25, 45, 75, and 105 krad of gamma radiation from a 137cesium source and cultured in vitro for 10 days. Irradiation reduced production of microfilariae in a dose-dependent manner. Embryograms of irradiated female worms showed dose-related abnormalities with arrested development at the early embryo stage. Irradiation reduced the viability of adult worms in a dose-dependent manner, but no lethal effect was observed. Electron microscopy studies showed that irradiation cleared Wolbachia from worm tissues. Real-time polymerase chain reaction studies demonstrated greatly reduced Wolbachia DNA in irradiated worms. These effects are essentially the same as those observed in adult worms treated with doxycycline. These studies suggest that effects of irradiation on reproduction in Brugia malayi may be caused by effects of irradiation on Wolbachia.",Included
1482,"Comparative evaluation of the in vitro micronucleus test and the comet assay for the detection of genotoxic effects of X-ray radiation The genotoxic effects of X-ray radiation on human lymphocytes were measured using the single cell gel electrophoresis (SCGE) assay (comet assay) and the cytokinesis-blocked micronucleus (CBMN) test; both were carried out in vitro on isolated human lymphocytes in order to compare the relationship and sensitivity of these two detecting methods. The radiation-doses were 0.00, 0.02, 0.05, 0.10, 0.25, 0.50, 1.00 and 2.00 Gy. In the comet assay, the average comet length (38.6+/-0.8 microm) of 0.05 Gy was significantly longer than that (29.4+/-1.1 microm) of 0 Gy (P<0.01), moreover, the average comet length increased with the dose of X-ray radiation. In the CBMN, both the average micronucleus rate (MN) and micronucleated cell rate (MNC) of 0.05 Gy were 11.5+/-4.5 per thousand, which showed no difference with that (7.5+/-0.5 per thousand) of 0 Gy (P>0.05). The lowest dose, which induced significant increase of average MN and MNC, was 0.25 Gy. The average MN and MNC rates increased with radiation-dose. The results showed that there was correlation between SCGE and CBMN, and the sensitivity of SCGE was significantly higher than that of CBMN.",Included
2058,"The impact of radiotherapy dose and other treatment-related and clinical factors on in-field control in stage I and II non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Purpose/Objective: To assess local (in-field) disease control, identify potential prognostic factors, and elucidate the optimal radiotherapy dose in various clinical settings of Stage I and II nonHodgkin's lymphoma (non-CNS). Material(s) and Method(s): A total of 285 consecutive patients with Stage I and II non-Hodgkin's lymphoma were treated with curative intent, including 159 with radiotherapy (RT) alone and 126 with combined-modality therapy (CMT). Of these, 72 patients had low-grade lymphomas (LGL), 92 had intermediate or high-grade lymphomas (I/HGL), and 21 had unclassified lymphomas. Clinical and treatment variables with potential prognostic significance for in-field disease control, freedom from relapse (FFR), and absolute survival (AS) were evaluated by univariate and multivariate analyses. Result(s): The 5-, 10-, and 20-year actuarial AS rates were 73%, 46%, and 33% for patients with LGL and 64%, 44%, and 18% for patients with I/HGL, respectively. The 5-, 10-, and 20- year actuarial FFR rates were 62%, 59%, and 49% for patients with LGL and 66%, 57%, and 57% for patients with I/HGL, respectively. Significant prognostic factors identified by the multivariate analysis were age, tumor size, and histology for AS; tumor size and treatment for FFR; and only tumor size for in-field disease control. There were 95 total failures, with only 12 occurring infield. Most failures (65%) were in contiguous unirradiated sites. All 4 in-field failures in patients with LGL occurred after RT doses < 30 Gy, although none occurred in 10 patients with small-volume LGL of the orbit treated with doses < 30 Gy. The 8 in-field failures in patients with I/HGL were distributed evenly throughout the RT dose range; 5 occurred in patients treated with CMT, all with tumors > 6 cm, and 4 with less than a complete response (CR) to chemotherapy. Conclusion(s): Our analysis suggests that the overwhelming problem in the treatment of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma is not in- field failure but, rather, failure in contiguous unirradiated sites. A dose of 20-25 Gy may be sufficient for small-volume LGL of the orbit. A dose of 30 Gy is sufficient for LGL in general, as well as for patients with nonbulky (<= 6 cm) I/HGL treated with CMT who have a CR. However, patients with I/HGL treated with CMT for tumors > 6 cm and/or without a CR may benefit from doses >= 40 Gy.",Excluded
2876,"Genetic susceptibility to thymic lymphomas and K-ras gene mutation in mice after exposure to X-rays and N-ethyl-N-nitrosourea PURPOSE: Ras activation is one of the major mechanisms for the development of murine thymic lymphomas by radiation and chemical carcinogens. To gain insight into the relationship between genetic susceptibility and ras gene mutation, the frequency and spectrum of ras gene mutation was examined in thymic lymphomas from susceptible and resistant mice., MATERIALS AND METHODS: K- and N-ras mutations in thymic lymphomas that arose in X-ray-irradiated and N-ethyl-N-nitrosourea (ENU)-treated mice of susceptible C57BL/6, rather resistant C3H and their hybrid B6C3F1 were analysed by polymerase chain reaction-single-strand conformation polymorphism and subsequent DNA sequencing., RESULTS: C57BL/6 exhibited a higher incidence of thymic lymphomas after exposure to X-rays and ENU than C3H, with B6C3F1 being intermediate. K-ras gene mutations occurred frequently in the pathogenesis of ENU-induced thymic lymphomas in susceptible C57BL/6 as opposed to resistant C3H. The ras mutations were more frequent in ENU-induced thymic lymphomas than X-ray-induced thymic lymphomas, and with the latter, there was no clear evidence for strain differences, suggesting that the genetic susceptibility to X-rays was independent of ras activation. The mutations of K-ras in thymic lymphomas from C57BL/6 were predominantly GGT to GAT in codon 12, whereas this mutation type was never found in those from C3H. No strain difference was observed in the nucleotide sequence or expression levels of O(6)-alkylguanine alkyltransferase, indicating that this enzyme did not account for the genetic susceptibility to ras activation., CONCLUSIONS: The results indicate that there is a clear strain and carcinogen dependency of K-ras mutation and that the frequency of ras mutation might determine the genetic susceptibility to ENU-induced lymphomagenesis, whereas pathways independent of ras activation might determine the susceptibility to X-ray-induced lymphomagenesis.",Included
1167,"Three-dimensional surface imaging for detection of intra-fraction setup variations during radiotherapy of pelvic tumors PURPOSE: Surface-based image guided radiotherapy (IGRT) allows positioning and/or monitoring patients in 3 dimensions (3D), without the use of ionizing radiation. In this study, we report on intra-fraction motion measured by acquisition of multiple images of 3D body surfaces., MATERIALS AND METHODS: Twenty-nine patients treated for pelvic tumors were enrolled. Setup variations (SV) through three consecutive body surfaces acquired by the optical IGRT system Align-RT (Vision-RT, London, UK) were analyzed before, during and at the end of treatment delivery. Displacements along the main axes (X, Y and Z) from initial (I) to mid-treatment (MT) and final (F) acquisitions were recorded. Time and direction of SV were assessed., RESULTS: A total of 6272 images from 792 fractions of 29 patients were available. The main source of misalignment was between I and MT acquisition (p < 0.001). The dominant SV direction was the vertical one (Z axis), with mean SV of -1.20 +/- 0.06 mm and -1.55 +/- 0.06 mm for I-MT and I-F acquisitions, respectively. The Y mean components of SV were, respectively, -0.95 +/- 0.10 mm and -1.0 +/- 0.10 for I-MT and I-F acquisitions, while the X deviations were 0.07 +/- 0.08 mm for I-MT and 0.26 +/- 0.08 mm I-F., CONCLUSION: Three-D surface imaging for patient setup monitoring highlighted remarkable mobility of patients during RT session, especially in the anterior-posterior direction (Z axis). The largest magnitude in patient movements occurred during the first part of delivery. These findings suggest that the initial setup control cannot not to be sufficient to guarantee treatment reproducibility, especially for long-lasting RT treatments.",Excluded

3120,"Tube placement using 'IRIS': A pilot assessment of its utility and safety INTRODUCTION: Most critically ill patients have a feeding tube placed blindly, but 0.5% result in a major lung complication because misplacement is only detected at the end of procedure. Real-time guided tube placement may pre-empt such complications. This clinical effectiveness study examined the ability to visualise anatomy using KangarooTM feeding tubes with IRIS technology ('IRIS' tube). METHOD(S): In a single centre, gastric or intestinal integrated real-time imaging system (IRIS) tubes were prospectively placed in critically ill patients noting the anatomical visualisation. RESULT(S): Of 15 placements, 13 were successful gastric placements and used for feeding but one gastric and one intestinal placement failed because of signal loss and inability to find the pylorus, respectively; both tubes were removed. Air insufflation and fluid aspiration were possible with all tubes. Respiratory misplacement was clearly differentiated, prior to reaching the main carina, from gastrointestinal (GI) anatomical markers, permitting removal before causing trauma. Furthermore, non-traumatic placement was visualised in high-risk cases including during advancement through a nostril with a base of skull fracture and into a stomach with a recently haemorrhaging gastric polyp. Individually assessed, direct vision may offer greater safety. X-ray or pH of aspirated fluid confirmed the position of GI tube placements. One adverse event occurred during placement, reversible bradycardia, in a patient previously having bradycardia. Vision was intermittently obscured by bile, mucus or impaction with mucosa. CONCLUSION(S): 'IRIS' tubes offer real-time guidance regarding anatomical position. Larger studies are needed to establish the best techniques of deploying this equipment and over-coming the difficulties observed.Crown Copyright © 2021. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

2256,"Cytogenetic responses to G2 phase X-irradiation of cells from retinoblastoma patients Fibroblast cell lines from 20 retinoblastoma (RB) patients with the hereditary bilateral form of disease compared with 16 lines from normal donors had a significantly higher chromatid aberration frequency (CAF), and more displaced and nondisplaced breaks per 100 metaphase cells after x- irradiation during the G2 phase of the cell cycle. The mean CAF was 39 +/- 1.0, range 30-46, for cells from normal subjects, compared to a mean of 245.6, range 101-506, for cells from hereditary RB patients (p < 10-6). Of fibroblast lines from eight patients with unilateral RB, four had a CAF comparable to that of lines from normal donors (< 60) and four had a high CAF (> 130), resembling that of hereditary forms; two of the latter four lines were from patients with familial or deletion 13 forms of RB. Furthermore, in two families, PHA-stimulated blood lymphocytes from RB patients, one bilateral and one unilateral, and from certain unaffected first-degree relatives after G2 phase X-irradiation had a high CAF (>= 110) compared to a CAF (>= 53) of cells from three normal donors sampled at the same time. These results were shown not to be related to differences in cell cycle progression or initial extent of chromatid damage. The results suggest that the high frequency of chromatid aberrations in the cells from hereditary RB patients results from a genetic deficiency in DNA repair.",Included
420,"Effect of gamma radiation on resting B lymphocytes. II. Functional characterization of the antigen-presentation defect The effect of radiation on three discrete Ag-presentation functions in resting B cells was examined: 1) Ag uptake and processing, 2) expression of processed Ag in the context of functional class II molecules, and 3) provision of necessary co-stimulatory, or second,"" signals. Analysis of radiation's effect on B cell presentation of intact vs fragmented Ag or its effect on presentation by Ag-pulsed B cells indicated that damage to Ag uptake and processing could not account for the bulk of the radiation-induced Ag-presentation defect. Experiments with phosphatidylinositol hydrolysis as an indirect measure of TCR occupancy suggested that irradiation caused a fairly rapid (within 1 to 2 h) decrease in the ability of the B cell APC to display a stimulatory combination of Ag and class II molecule. Ag dose-response analyses demonstrated that when presenting a fragment of the Ag pigeon cytochrome c to a T cell clone, 3000 rad-treated B cell APC were able to stimulate approximately 50% as much phosphatidylinositol turnover as unirradiated B cells. It was also found that, in contrast to their inability to initiate T cell proliferation, and similarly to chemically cross-linked splenocytes, heavily irradiated resting B cells plus Ag induced a state of Ag hyporesponsiveness in T cell clones. This effect on T cells had the same Ag- and MHC-specificity as did receptor occupancy required for proliferation, indicating that heavily irradiated resting B cells bear functional class II molecules. Co-culture of T cells with allogeneic B cells and syngeneic heavily irradiated B cells or chemically cross-linked splenic APC plus Ag resulted in T cell proliferation and interfered with the induction of the hyporesponsive state. This co-stimulatory function was radiosensitive in resting allogeneic B cells. Together, these data support the hypothesis that the major functional consequences of radiation to resting B cell APC are a reduction in the effective display of Ag plus class II molecules and, probably what is more important, a loss in the ability to provide APC-derived co-stimulatory signals.""",Included

1260,"Effect of a proton pump inhibitor on postprandial gastric volume, emptying and symptoms in healthy human subjects: A pilot study Background: In consensus guidelines, proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) are recommended for the treatment of functional dyspepsia. It is unclear whether PPIs change gastric volume or emptying. Aim(s): To assess the effect of a PPI, rabeprazole, on gastric volume and emptying and postprandial symptoms. Method(s): In a double-blind, parallel-group placebo-controlled trial, 13 healthy participants were randomized to rabeprazole, 20 mg b.d., or placebo. On day 3, fasting gastric volume was measured using intravenous 99mTc- pertechnate and single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT). After the last dose of study medication, an 111In-chloride egg meal (300 kcal) was ingested, and postprandial gastric volume and emptying were measured by SPECT. Symptom ratings using a visual analogue scale (fullness, nausea, bloating, abdominal pain, aggregate score) were obtained at baseline and 15, 30, 45, 60 and 75 min postprandially. Group comparisons were performed using Mann-Whitney rank sum test. Result(s): There were no statistically significant differences in gastric volume or emptying in the two groups. However, there was a borderline increase in gastric volume with rabeprazole compared with placebo.

The results were compared with the ultrasound results of a control group of 142 patients presenting with symptoms of cerebrovascular disease or carotid bruit., RESULTS: NPC patients had a higher incidence of carotid stenosis (77 vs. 50.7%). The common carotid arteries were most commonly affected by radiation-induced stenosis (93/142 vs. 37/284 in the control group), whereas the carotid bulb was the most commonly affected (56/284) site in the control group. Significantly more NPC patients had moderate-to-severe stenosis (21/71 vs. 27/142). Analysis of the sonographic appearance of radiation-induced and atherosclerotic plaques showed more diffuse involvement in the post-radiation group. Non-calcified plaques and intraplaque hypoechoic foci were also more frequent in the post-radiation group., CONCLUSIONS: Radiation-induced carotid stenosis is more diffuse in distribution, is associated with more severe luminal stenosis and has different sonographic plaque characterisation compared with carotid stenosis without radiation exposure.

2247,"The patient's experience of defaecating proctography: Comparing magnetic resonance with conventional fluoroscopy techniques Introduction: Fluoroscopy and MRI are currently used to investigate defaecation and pelvic floor dysfunction, with advantages and disadvantages to both modalities. Anecdotally it is suspected that MRI, allowing more privacy, may be better tolerated by patients but that symptoms may be more easily replicated with fluoroscopic technique due to the physiological position. The aim of this study was to evaluate the patient experience of both techniques to potentially help guide the choice of defaecating proctography modality in the future. Method(s): This prospective study was conducted June 2015-March 2017 in a large teaching hospital. Patients undergoing fluoroscopy (FDP) or MR defaecating proctography (MRDP) completed a post-procedure questionnaire rating their satisfaction (1-5, 5 being most satisfied) of different aspects of the test. Result(s): 24 patients underwent FDP and 17 MRDP. Both procedures were scored highly in general for all questions with mean >4.1 and median 5, out of 5. Though not statistically significant, the mean scores for all aspects of the test were slightly higher for fluoroscopy than MR. As well as scoring higher for comfort (4.8 vs 4.4) and dignity maintained (4.6 vs 4.1), the patients who underwent fluoroscopy thought it was easier to replicate symptoms than the patient who underwent MR defaecating proctography (4.6 vs 4.2). Conclusion(s): This study shows that both FDP and MRDP are well tolerated in the investigation of defaecation and pelvic floor dysfunction. FDP was scored consistently higher than MRDP, but this was not statistically significant. Thus, this study suggests that patient tolerance of the test is unlikely to be any worse for FDP than for MRDP. Clinicians and radiologists should take into account risks of radiation exposure as well as potential for surgical management when making their decision as to which test is appropriate. The authors recommend that if the patient is unable to replicate their symptoms in MRDP, fluoroscopy should be performed to ensure significant pathology is not being missed.Copyright © 2018",Excluded

BCVA was measured and fundus photography, optical coherence tomography (OCT) and fluorescein angiography were performed at baseline. BCVA and OCT were recorded at each monthly visit. The duration of follow-up ranged from 6 months to 2 years., RESULTS: Five patients (7 eyes) were recruited. At the final visit, 3 eyes (71.4%) showed reduction in the central subfield thickness (CST; mean reduction of 17.6%, range 9-149 microm) with improvement in BCVA, whilst 2 eyes worsened in terms of CST and final BCVA. Another 2 eyes remained altered in BCVA despite slight improvement in CST., CONCLUSION: The use of intravitreal bevacizumab in this group of patients showed variable response in terms of CST and BCVA outcome but remains a viable option to treat this challenging condition.

3153,"The relationship between cumulative lifetime ultraviolet radiation exposure, bone mineral density, falls risk and fractures in older adults Data linking cumulative lifetime vitamin D status with skeletal outcomes are lacking. We show that increasing cumulative sun exposure was associated with higher bone mineral density in younger males and protective against fractures in females independent of current vitamin D. This supports the concept that cumulative sun exposure is an important contributor to skeletal health., INTRODUCTION: While low 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels are associated with increased fracture risk, this reflects only recent sun exposure. The Beagley-Gibson (BG) method utilises microtopographical skin changes to quantify cumulative lifetime ultraviolet radiation (sun) exposure. This study aimed to describe the relationship between BG grade, BMD, falls risk and fractures in older adults., METHODS: Eight hundred thirty-five community-dwelling adults aged 53-83 years had silicone casts from the dorsum of both hands graded by the BG method. BMD was measured using DXA and falls risk using the short form of the Physiological Profile Assessment. Vertebral deformities and symptomatic fractures were assessed by DXA and questionnaire, respectively., RESULTS: The relationship between BG grade, spine BMD and vertebral fracture varied depending upon sex. In females, increasing grade was associated with lower vertebral fracture prevalence (OR = 0.44/grade, p = 0.018) and fewer fractures (OR = 0.82/grade, p = 0.021), particularly major fractures (OR = 0.75/grade, p = 0.03). In males, increasing grade was associated with more DXA-detected vertebral deformities (RR = 1.28/grade, p = 0.001), but not symptomatic fractures. These relationships were independent of BMD, falls risk, smoking and current 25-hydroxyvitamin D. BG grade was not associated with falls risk. For BMD, there were interactions between BG grade and both age and sex and a positive trend with hip BMD in younger males., CONCLUSIONS: BG grade demonstrated beneficial associations with fracture outcomes in females and BMD in younger males independent of current 25-hydroxyvitamin D. These data support the concept that cumulative ultraviolet radiation exposure is an important determinant of skeletal health. The association with vertebral deformities in males may reflect outdoor physical trauma in younger life.",Excluded
2361,"Low dose IR-induced IGF-1-sCLU expression: a p53-repressed expression cascade that interferes with TGFbeta1 signaling to confer a pro-survival bystander effect Inadvertent mammalian tissue exposures to low doses of ionizing radiation (IR) after radiation accidents, remediation of radioactive-contaminated areas, space travel or a dirty bomb represent an interesting trauma to an organism. Possible low-dose IR-induced bystander effects could impact our evaluation of human health effects, as cells within tissue are not equally damaged after doses of IR <=10 cGy. To understand tissue responses after low IR doses, we generated a reporter system using the human clusterin promoter fused to firefly luciferase (hCLUp-Luc). Secretory clusterin (sCLU), an extracellular molecular chaperone, induced by low doses of cytotoxic agents, clears cell debris. Low-dose IR (>=2 cGy) exposure induced hCLUp-Luc activity with peak levels at 96 h, consistent with endogenous sCLU levels. As doses increased (>=1 Gy), sCLU induction amplitudes increased and time-to-peak response decreased. sCLU expression was stimulated by insulin-like growth factor-1, but suppressed by p53. Responses in transgenic hCLUp-Luc reporter mice after low IR doses showed that specific tissues (that is, colon, spleen, mammary, thymus and bone marrow) of female mice induced hCLUp-Luc activity more than male mice after whole body (>=10 cGy) irradiation. Tissue-specific, non-linear dose- and time-responses of hCLUp-Luc and endogenous sCLU levels were noted. Colon maintained homeostatic balance after 10 cGy. Bone marrow responded with delayed, but prolonged and elevated expression. Intraperitoneal administration of alpha-transforming growth factor (TGF)beta1 (1D11), but not control (13C4) antibodies, immediately following IR exposure abrogated CLU induction responses. Induction in vivo also correlated with Smad signaling by activated TGFbeta1 after IR. Mechanistically, media with elevated sCLU levels suppressed signaling, blocked apoptosis and increased survival of TGFbeta1-exposed tumor or normal cells. Thus, sCLU is a pro-survival bystander factor that abrogates TGFbeta1 signaling and most likely promotes wound healing.",Included
450,"V30 as a predictor for radiation-induced hypothyroidism: A dosimetric analysis in patients who received radiotherapy to the neck Introduction: The purpose of this study is to evaluate the possible predictors of thyroid disorders after neck radiotherapy, with a focus on radiation dose-volume factors. Method(s): Thyroid function was measured in 100 patients who had received radiotherapy to the neck, including the thyroid. All radiation-induced thyroid dysfunctions were determined with an endpoint of abnormal thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH), free triiodothyronine (fT3) and thyroxine (fT4) and thyroid peroxidase antibodies and (TPA). The total volume of the thyroid, mean radiation dose to the thyroid (Dmean) and thyroid volume percentage that received radiation doses of 10-50 Gy (V10-V50) were calculated in all patients. The evaluated risk factors for thyroid dysfunction included dose-volume parameters, sex, age, previous surgery, chemotherapy and comorbidity. Result(s): There were 52 patients with hypothyroidism and V30 (p = 0.03), thyroid volume (p = 0.01) and Dmean (p = 0.03) appeared to be correlated with hypothyroidism in univariate analysis. However, there was not association found in multivariate analysis for these factors. Conclusion(s): Thyroid disorders after radiation therapy to the neck still represent a clinically underestimated problem. V30 may be a useful tool for evaluating the risk of hypothyroidism when determining an individual patient's treatment. © 2014 Akgun et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",Excluded
3672,"Risk factors of radiation-induced acute esophagitis in non-small cell lung cancer patients treated with concomitant chemoradiotherapy BACKGROUND: To analyze the clinical and dosimetric risk factors of acute esophagitis (AE) in non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients treated with concomitant chemoradiotherapy., METHODS: Seventy-six NSCLC patients treated with concomitant chemoradiotherapy were retrospectively analyzed. Forty-one patients received concomitant chemoradiotherapy with vinorelbine/cisplatin (VC), 35 with docetaxel/cisplatin (DC). AE was graded according to criteria of the Radiation Therapy Oncology Group (RTOG). The following clinical and dosimetric parameters were analyzed: gender, age, clinical stage, Karnofsky performance status (KPS), pretreatment weight loss, concomitant chemotherapy agents (CCA) (VC vs. DC), percentage of esophagus volume treated to >= 20 (V20), >= 30 (V30), >= 40 (V40), >= 50 (V50) and >= 60 Gy (V60), and the maximum (Dmax) and mean doses (Dmean) delivered to esophagus. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analysis were used to test the association between the different factors and AE., RESULTS: Seventy patients developed AE (Grade 1, 19 patients; Grade 2, 36 patients; and Grade 3, 15 patients). By multivariate logistic regression analysis, V40 was the only statistically significant factor associated with Grade >= 2 AE (p<0.001, OR = 1.159). A V40 of <23% had a 33.3% (10/30) risk of Grade >= 2 AE, which increased to 89.1% (41/46) with a V40 of >= 23% (p<0.001). CCA (p =0.01; OR = 9.686) and V50 (p<0.001; OR = 1.122) were most significantly correlated with grade 3 AE. A V50 of <26.5% had a 6.7% (3/45) risk of Grade 3 AE, which increased to 38.7% (12/31) with a V50 of >= 26.5% (p = 0.001). On the linear regression analysis, V50 and CCA were significant independent factors affecting AE duration. Patients who received concomitant chemotherapy with VC had a decreased risk of grade 3 AE and shorter duration compared with DC., CONCLUSIONS: Concomitant chemotherapy agents have potential influence on AE. Concomitant chemotherapy with VC led to lower risk of AE compared with that using DC. V40 and V50 of esophagus can predict grade >= 2 and >= 3 AE, respectively.",Excluded
3345,"Humanized mouse model: Hematopoietic stemcell transplantation and tracking using short tandem repeat technology Introduction: Models of mice carrying a human immune system, so-called humanized mice, are used increasingly as preclinical models to bridge the gap between model organisms and human beings. Challenges of the humanized mouse model include finding suitable sources for human hematopoietic stem cells (HSC) and reaching sufficient engraftment of these cells in immunocompromised mice. Method(s): In this study, we compared the use of CD34+ HSC from cord blood (CB) vs HSC from adult mobilized peripheral blood. Furthermore, we developed a simple and highly specific test for donor identification in humanized mice by applying the detection method of short tandem repeats (STR). Result(s): It was found that, in vitro, CB-derived and adult HSC show comparable purity, viability, and differentiation potential in colony-forming unit assays. However, in vivo, CB-derived HSC engrafted to a significantly higher extent in NOD.Cg-PrkdcscidIL2rgammatm1Wjl/SzJ (NSG) mice than adult HSC. Increasing the cell dose of adult HSC or using fresh cells without cryopreservation did not improve the engraftment rate. Interestingly, when using adult HSC, the percentage of human cells in the bone marrow was significantly higher than that in the peripheral blood. Using the STR-based test, we were able to identify and distinguish human cells from different donors in humanized mice and in a humanized allogeneic transplantation model. Conclusion(s): From these findings, we conclude that adult mobilized HSC are less suitable for generating a humanized immune system in mice than CB-derived cells.Copyright © The Authors.

3297,"The role of barium swallow in the management of the globus pharyngeus Globus pharyngeus is a common benign condition with controversial management. Patients with globus pharyngeus are usually investigated to exclude the possibility of upper aerodiagestive malignancies. There is a great debate about the role of barium swallow in the management of this condition. Review of 1,145 barium swallow repourts of patients presented with globus pharyngeus between 1999 and 2004 has failed to diagnose any patient with pharyngeal or oesophageal cancer. We conclude that barium swallow should not be requested systematically as part of management of globus pharyngeus patients.

267,"Prospective Evaluation of Reduced Dose Computed Tomography for the Detection of Low-Contrast Liver Lesions: Direct Comparison with Concurrent Standard Dose Imaging OBJECTIVES: To prospectively compare the diagnostic performance of reduced-dose (RD) contrast-enhanced CT (CECT) with standard-dose (SD) CECT for detection of low-contrast liver lesions., METHODS: Seventy adults with non-liver primary malignancies underwent abdominal SD-CECT immediately followed by RD-CECT, aggressively targeted at 60-70 % dose reduction. SD series were reconstructed using FBP. RD series were reconstructed with FBP, ASIR, and MBIR (Veo). Three readers-blinded to clinical history and comparison studies-reviewed all series, identifying liver lesions >=4 mm. Non-blinded review by two experienced abdominal radiologists-assessing SD against available clinical and radiologic information-established the reference standard., RESULTS: RD-CECT mean effective dose was 2.01 +/- 1.36 mSv (median, 1.71), a 64.1 +/- 8.8 % reduction. Pooled per-patient performance data were (sensitivity/specificity/PPV/NPV/accuracy) 0.91/0.78/0.60/0.96/0.81 for SD-FBP compared with RD-FBP 0.79/0.75/0.54/0.91/0.76; RD-ASIR 0.84/0.75/0.56/0.93/0.78; and RD-MBIR 0.84/0.68/0.49/0.92/0.72. ROC AUC values were 0.896/0.834/0.858/0.854 for SD-FBP/RD-FBP/RD-ASIR/RD-MBIR, respectively. RD-FBP (P = 0.002) and RD-MBIR (P = 0.032) AUCs were significantly lower than those of SD-FBP; RD-ASIR was not (P = 0.052). Reader confidence was lower for all RD series (P < 0.001) compared with SD-FBP, especially when calling patients entirely negative., CONCLUSIONS: Aggressive CT dose reduction resulted in inferior diagnostic performance and reader confidence for detection of low-contrast liver lesions compared to SD. Relative to RD-ASIR, RD-FBP showed decreased sensitivity and RD-MBIR showed decreased specificity., KEY POINTS: * Reduced-dose CECT demonstrates inferior diagnostic performance for detecting low-contrast liver lesions. * Reader confidence is lower with reduced-dose CECT compared to standard-dose CECT. * Overly aggressive dose reduction may result in misdiagnosis, regardless of reconstruction algorithm. * Careful consideration of perceived risks versus benefits of dose reduction is crucial.",Excluded
342,"Malignant melanoma risk by nativity, place of residence at diagnosis, and age at migration Although geographic latitude is clearly linked to the risk of cutaneous malignant melanoma, the chronology of this link is unclear. Based on the 4,611 cases of melanoma with known place of nativity diagnosed in 1972-82 among the non-Latino White residents of Los Angeles County (California, United States) of known place of origin, migrants to Los Angeles from higher US latitudes enjoy relative safety from skin melanoma. This relative safety is largely unaffected by the interval since migration, even after decades of residence in Los Angeles. The same relative protection is enjoyed by native residents of more northerly US communities in comparison with co-resident migrants from the southwestern US. While the observed effect of latitude is consistent with the accepted importance of solar radiation as a determinant of melanoma risk, it suggests that early, rather than late or cumulative, exposure is of most importance. This finding does not affirm the belief that protection of adult skin from exposure to the sun will reduce the risk from melanoma. It does suggest that decades must pass before it will be possible to assess the impact on melanoma risk of any increase in ultraviolet radiation delivered to the earth as a result of the destruction of atmospheric ozone.",Excluded
3186,"Extreme solar event of AD775: Potential radiation exposure to crews in deep space The existence of a historically large cosmic event in AD774 or 775, of probable solar origin, has recently been confirmed from records of 14C levels in tree rings located at widely separated locations on Earth, 10Be records in polar ice cores, and historical records of aurora sightings. Usoskin et al (Astronomy & Astrophysics, 2013) suggest that such an event, of solar origin, would have a proton fluence of 4.5 1010 cm-2 at energies above 30 MeV, with a hard energy spectrum comparable to the event of 23 February 1956. In this work we investigate the possible radiation exposures to crews of missions on the surface of Mars, from such an event. In this work we use the HZETRN radiation transport code, originally developed at NASA Langley Research Center, and the Computerized Anatomical Male and Female human geometry models to estimate exposures for a variety of aluminum shield areal densities similar to those provided by a spacesuit, surface lander, and permanent habitat on the Martian surface. Comparisons of the predicted organ exposures with recently-recommended radiation exposure limits are made. Potential health effects on crews, of such an event, are also discussed.",Excluded

819,"Role of aortic calcification, stiffness and wave reflections in cardiovascular risk in dialysis patients: Baseline data from the CORD study Background: Accurate cardiovascular risk estimation in dialysis patients remains challenging because different pathogenetic mechanisms act simultaneously in this heterogeneous population. Radiographic calcification, aortic stiffness and wave reflection, have each individually been proven to be reliable surrogate markers for outcome. We aimed to explore to what extent these parameters intermutually provide complementary or overlapping information. Method(s): Abdominal aortic calcification scoring of a plain lateral abdominal X-ray, carotid-femoral pulse wave velocity (PWV), and central augmentation index (AIx) were measured in 1084 dialysis patients, recruited from 47 European dialysis centers. Result(s): Abdominal calcification correlated well with PWV (R = 0.44, P < 0.001) but poorly with AIx (R = 0.07, P = 0.04). Next to abdominal calcification, tertiles of PWV were associated with a stepwise increase age, blood pressure, and cardiovascular history, and tertiles of AIx with age, heart rate, and anthropometric factors. In multivariate analysis, only PWV remained significantly associated with calcification score. In addition to age and blood pressure, stiffness was mainly related to diabetes and calcification score (R2 = 0.39, P < 0.001), whereas AIx was more dependent on anthropometry, gender and heart rate (R2 = 0.36, P < 0.001). Conclusion(s): Information on aortic calcification and arterial abnormalities can be obtained by simple and inexpensive methodologies. Variation in wave reflections was mainly explained by anthropometric parameters. Stiffness and calcification partly provided complementary information, particularly in low-risk patients. In this group, likely to benefit most from preventive strategies and commonly considered for renal transplantation, evaluation of cardiovascular risk could be made more accurate by the assessment of both aortic calcification and arterial stiffness. © 2010 Association for Research into Arterial Structure and Physiology.",Excluded
1341,"Cisplatin-based chemoradiation plus cetuximab in locally advanced head and neck cancer: A phase II clinical study Background: Intensification of chemoradiation for advanced head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) is unlikely due to toxicity. Cetuximab combined either with radiotherapy or with chemotherapy showed favourable toxic profile with positive results in both combinations. Therefore, cetuximab could intensify chemoradiation without worsening toxicity. We conducted a phase II study of chemoradiation and cetuximab. Patients and Methods: Eligible patients had stage III-IV M0 HNSCC. Treatment consisted of three cycles of cisplatin (20 mg/m2/day x 5 days) and fluorouracil (200 mg/m2/day x 5 days) rapidly alternated to three split courses of radiotherapy up to 70 Gy and concurrent weekly cetuximab. The primary end point of the study was complete response (CR) rate. Secondary end points were toxicity, progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS). Result(s): Fourty-five patients were enrolled: median age was 56 years, 38 had stage IV disease and 40 nodal involvement. CR occurred in 32 patients (71%). PFS and OS was 21+ months and 32.6+, respectively. Acute grade 3-4 toxic effects were in the expected range, but grade 3 radiodermatitis occurred in 33 patients. Conclusion(s): The combination of cetuximab, cisplatin, fluorouracil and radiotherapy leads to a very high proportion of CR and it is feasible with toxic effects similar to those expected by radiochemotherapy. The only unexpected toxicity was skin toxicity: grade 3 radiodermatitis occurred in 73% of the patients. © The Author 2010.

Material(s) and Method(s): Irradiated head and neck cancer patients reporting for dental extractions were prospectively enrolled to the study between January 2002 and December 2009. Selection criteria for the patients included the presence of nonrestorable tooth/teeth in the field of radiation, latency period of 6 months since completion of radiotherapy, radiation dosages >60 Gy, and availability for follow-up. Starting from 10 days preextraction, the patients were prescribed 8th hourly oral amoxicillin 500 mg along with 12th hourly mouthwashes using 10 ml of undiluted chlorhexidine gluconate 0.2% solution. The same prescription was continued for 7 days postextraction. All patients were followed-up at regular intervals until December 2013. Result(s): A total of 89 patients (55 male and 34 female) underwent extractions of teeth which were present in the radiation field. Mean age of the patients was 41.8 years (range 36-54 years) and extractions were done between 12 and 33 months (mean - 15 months) postradiation therapy.

We sought to determine the noninvasive factors (without radiation exposure) significantly associated with CAC in low-risk, asymptomatic persons. In a cross-sectional analysis, we studied 3,046 participants from the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis at a low 10-year predicted risk (Framingham risk score <10%) of coronary heart disease events. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was used to assess the association of novel markers with the presence of any CAC (CAC >0) and advanced CAC (CAC >= 300). A CAC level of >0 and of >= 300 was present in 30% and 3.5% of participants, respectively. Factor VIIIc, fibrinogen, and soluble intercellular adhesion molecule were each associated with the presence of CAC (p <= 0.02), and C-reactive protein, D-dimer, and the carotid intima-media thickness with advanced CAC (p <= 0.03). The base model combining the traditional risk factors had excellent discrimination for advanced CAC (C-statistic 0.808). The addition of the 2 best-fit models combining the biomarkers with or without carotid intima-media thickness improved the c-statistic to 0.822 and 0.820, respectively. All 3 models calibrated well but were similar in estimating the individual risk probabilities for advanced CAC (prevalence 9.97%, 10.63%, and 10.10% in the greatest quartiles of predicted probabilities vs 0.26%, 0.26%, and 0.26% in the lowest quartiles, respectively). In conclusion, in low-risk persons, the traditional risk factors alone predicted advanced CAC with high discrimination and calibration. The biomarker combinations with and without carotid intima-media thickness were also significantly associated with advanced CAC; however, the improvement in the prediction and estimation of the clinical risk were modest compared to the traditional risk factors alone.

150,"Estimation of activity of administered 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose by measurement of the dose equivalent rate on the right temporal region of the head Background: Positron emission tomography (PET) with 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) is now a routine procedure for the management of cancer patients. Intravenous administration of FDG is sometimes halted due to troubles. In such cases, estimations of the FDG dosage injected prior to halting administration may be helpful. We have established a method of estimating the activity of FDG to patients on the basis of the dose equivalent rate on the surface of the right temporal region of the head. The correlation of actual administered dosage with independent variables, such as the dose equivalent rate on the right temporal region of the head, age, sex, and body weight, was analyzed using multiple regression analysis to obtain linear, quadratic, and cubic regression equations. Result(s): When entering independent variables, the cubic regression equation could be used to estimate an administered dosage with an accuracy of +/-10 % for 62 % of all patients and +/-20 % for 90 % of all patients. Conclusion(s): We conclude that this method is useful for estimating the administered dosage from the dose equivalent rate on the temporal region of the head.Copyright © 2016, The Author(s).",Excluded
