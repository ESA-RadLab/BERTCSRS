623,"Risks factors concerning bone loss in Moroccan patients with inflammatory bowel diseases Background: Osteoporosis and osteopenia have been reported frequently in patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). The aim of the study: To determine the prevalence and risk factors of osteoporosis in patients with IBD. Method(s): Prospective study was performed from January 2010 to October 2011 in our center, 96 patients with IBD (55 Crohn's Disease, 41 Ulcerative Colitis) were included, 54 men and 42 women with a mean age of 36+/-10.4 years (18 68 years) and no history of disorders known to influence bone metabolism. Dualenergy X-ray absorptiometry measurements of bone mineral density (BMD) were obtained at the femoral neck and lumbar spine. A multivariate model including those factors significantly associated with low BMD in the univariate analysis was used to identify independent risk factors. Result(s): Osteopenia was found in 37.7% and osteoporosis in 22.5% of patients. Low BMD was significantly associated with low body mass index (BMI), colonic involvement, and glucocorticoid therapy. Low BMI was an independent risk factor for low BMD. Malnutrition with BMI <18 kg/m2 was noted in 41 patients, of whom 76% had low BMD values, as compared to 49% of the patients whose BMI was >18 kg/m2 (P = 0.02, odds ratio = 3.5). Conclusion(s): Among risk factors for bone loss in patients with IBD, malnutrition plays a prominent role that deserves attention when planning treatment programs.",Excluded
485,"Diagnostic capability and radiation dose of cone beam CT dacryocystography in different scanning fields of view in healthy volunteers OBJECTIVES: Cone beam CT dacryocystography (CBCT-DCG) is a new imaging technique for assessing the lacrimal drainage system (LDS). The purpose of this pilot study is to compare the diagnostic capability and radiation dose of CBCT-DCG in different scanning fields of view (FOV) to evaluate the possibilities of the reduction of radiation dose. METHOD(S): Fifteen healthy volunteers underwent CBCT-DCG in an upright position. The first five subjects were scanned using the scanning FOV of 11x10 cm (Group A), then 8x8 cm (Group B), and the last five subjects 5x5.5 cm (Group C). The image quality and diagnostic validity of different groups were evaluated by two experienced otolaryngologists. The effective dose of each group was calculated and compared. RESULT(S): All images showed good delineation of the LDS and its surrounding structures. With regard to the image quality and diagnostic validity, no differences were found among different groups. Compared with Group A, the effective radiation dose for Group B (38.40 muSv) was 38.54% lower and that for Group C (17.12 muSv) was 72.60% lower. CONCLUSION(S): A substantial reduction of the effective dose for CBCT-DCG in healthy volunteer by decreasing FOV is possible without compromising the diagnostic capability. CBCT-DCG is a potential valid first-line imaging test for the evaluation of LDS, and it permits functional assessment of lacrimal drainage.",Excluded
950,"Application of Mixed Reality Using Optical See-Through Head-Mounted Displays in Transforaminal Percutaneous Endoscopic Lumbar Discectomy Purpose. Mixed reality (MixR) technology merges the real and virtual worlds to produce new environments and visualizations; it is being tested for numerous minimally invasive surgical procedures. This study is aimed at evaluating the use of MixR technology using optical see-through head-mounted displays (OST-HMDs) during transforaminal percutaneous endoscopic discectomy (TPED). Methods. Forty-four patients treated with MixR-assisted TPED through OST-HMDs were compared with matched patients treated with conventional TPED (n=43). In the MixR-assisted TPED group, MixR technology was used to navigate the four procedures of marking, needle insertion, foraminoplasty, and positioning of the working sheath. The clinical outcomes were evaluated based on the numerical rating scale (NRS) scores and Oswestry Disability Index (ODI) on preoperative and postoperative day 1 and at the last follow-up examination. The procedural times, radiation exposure, and eye fatigue were also recorded. All patients were followed up for at least 6 months. Results. The NRS scores and ODI were significantly improved in both groups at the last follow-up visit compared with the preoperative values (P<0.05); these values were not statistically different between the groups. The operation time and radiation exposure during marking, needle insertion, and total procedure significantly decreased in the MixR-assisted TPED group compared to those in the conventional TPED group (P<0.05). Unfortunately, the incidence of eye fatigue increased owing to the use of OST-HMDs in the MixR-assisted TPED group. Conclusion. This study shows the utility of MixR technology for image guidance in conventional TPED. Radiation exposure is decreased, and this technology serves as a valuable tool during the TPED procedure; however, the assistance of conventional fluoroscopy is still required.

439,"Mortality from diseases other than cancer following low doses of ionizing radiation: results from the 15-Country Study of nuclear industry workers BACKGROUND: Ionizing radiation at very high (radio-therapeutic) dose levels can cause diseases other than cancer, particularly heart diseases. There is increasing evidence that doses of the order of a few sievert (Sv) may also increase the risk of non-cancer diseases. It is not known, however, whether such effects also occur following the lower doses and dose rates of public health concern., METHODS: We used data from an international (15-country) nuclear workers cohort study to evaluate whether mortality from diseases other than cancer is related to low doses of external ionizing radiation. Analyses included 275 312 workers with adequate information on socioeconomic status, over 4 million person-years of follow-up and an average cumulative radiation dose of 20.7 mSv; 11 255 workers had died of non-cancer diseases., RESULTS: The excess relative risk (ERR) per Sv was 0.24 [95% CI (confidence intervals) -0.23, 0.78] for mortality from all non-cancer diseases and 0.09 (95% CI -0.43, 0.70) for circulatory diseases. Higher risk estimates were observed for mortality from respiratory and digestive diseases, but confidence intervals included zero. Increased risks were observed among the younger workers (attained age <50 years, identified post hoc) for all groupings of non-cancer causes of death, including external causes. It is unclear therefore whether these findings reflect real effects of radiation, random variation or residual confounding., CONCLUSIONS: The most informative low-dose radiation study to date provides little evidence for a relationship between mortality from non-malignant diseases and radiation dose. However, we cannot rule out risks per unit dose of the same order of magnitude as found in studies at higher doses.",Included
767,"The Role of Parathyroid Hormone-Related Protein (PTHrP) in Osteoblast Response to Microgravity: Mechanistic Implications for Osteoporosis Development Prolonged skeletal unloading through bedrest results in bone loss similar to that observed in elderly osteoporotic patients, but with an accelerated timeframe. This rapid effect on weight-bearing bones is also observed in astronauts who can lose up to 2% of their bone mass per month spent in Space. Despite the important implications for Spaceflight travelers and bedridden patients, the exact mechanisms involved in disuse osteoporosis have not been elucidated. Parathyroid hormone-related protein (PTHrP) regulates many physiological processes including skeletal development, and has been proposed as a mechanosensor. To investigate the role of PTHrP in microgravity-induced bone loss, trabecular and calvarial osteoblasts (TOs and COs) from Pthrp +/+ and -/- mice were subjected to actual Spaceflight for 6 days (Foton M3 satellite). Pthrp +/+, +/- and -/- osteoblasts were also exposed to simulated microgravity for periods varying from 6 days to 6 weeks. While COs displayed little change in viability in 0g, viability of all TOs rapidly decreased in inverse proportion to PTHrP expression levels. Furthermore, Pthrp+/+ TOs displayed a sharp viability decline after 2 weeks at 0g. Microarray analysis of Pthrp+/+ TOs after 6 days in simulated 0g revealed expression changes in genes encoding prolactins, apoptosis/survival molecules, bone metabolism and extra-cellular matrix composition proteins, chemokines, insulin-like growth factor family members and Wnt-related signalling molecules. 88% of 0g-induced expression changes in Pthrp+/+ cells overlapped those caused by Pthrp ablation in normal gravity, and pulsatile treatment with PTHrP1-36 not only reversed a large proportion of 0g-induced effects in Pthrp+/+ TOs but maintained viability over 6-week exposure to microgravity. Our results confirm PTHrP efficacy as an anabolic agent to prevent microgravity-induced cell death in TOs.",Excluded
22,"Automated identification and grading of coronary artery stenoses with X-ray angiography BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: X-ray coronary angiography (XCA) remains the gold standard imaging technique for the diagnosis and treatment of cardiovascular disease. Automatic detection and grading of coronary stenoses in XCA are challenging problems due to the complex overlap of different background structures with intensity inhomogeneities. We present a new computerized image based method to accurately identify and quantify the stenosis severity on XCA., METHODS: A unified framework, consisting of Hessian-based vessel enhancement, level-set skeletonization, improved measure of match measurement, and local extremum identification, is developed to distinctly reveal the vessel structures and accurately determine the stenosis grades. The methodology was validated on 143 consecutive patients who underwent diagnostic XCA through both qualitative and quantitative evaluations., RESULTS: The presented algorithm was tested on a set of 267 vessel segments annotated by two expert cardiologists. The experimental results show that the method can effectively localize and quantify the vessel stenoses, achieving average detection accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and F-score of 93.93%, 91.03%, 93.83%, 89.18%, respectively., CONCLUSIONS: A fully automatic coronary analysis method is devised for vessel stenosis detection and grading in XCA. The presented approach can potentially serve as a generalized framework to handle different image modalities. Copyright © 2018. Published by Elsevier B.V.",Excluded
1052,"Diagnostic accuracy of ultra-low-dose CT for torsion measurement of the lower limb Objectives: The study aimed to investigate the diagnostic performance of simulated ultra-low-dose CT (ULD-CT) for torsion measurement of the lower limb. Method(s): Thirty retrospectively identified patients were included (32.3 +/- 14.2 years; 14 women, 16 men). ULD-CT simulations were generated at dose levels of 100%, 10%, 5%, and 1% using two reconstruction methods: standard filtered back projection (FBP) and iterative reconstruction (ADMIRE). Two readers measured the lower limb torsion in all data sets. The readers also captured image noise in standardized anatomical landmarks. All data sets were evaluated regarding subjective diagnostic confidence (DC; 5-point Likert scale). Effective radiation dose of the original data sets and the simulated ULD-CT was compared. Result(s): There was no significant difference of measured lower limb torsion in any simulated dose level compared to the original data sets in both readers. Dose length product (DLP) of the original examinations was 402.1 +/- 4.3 mGy cm, which resulted in an effective radiation dose of 4.00 +/- 2.12 mSv. Calculated effective radiation dose in ULD-CT at 1% of the original dose was 0.04 mSv. Image noise increased significantly with dose reduction (p < 0.0001) and was dependent on the reconstructional method (p < 0.0001) with less noise using ADMIRE compared to FBP. Both readers rated DC at doses 100%, 10%, and 5% with 5.0/5: there were no ratings worse than 3/5 at 1% dose level. Conclusion(s): The results suggest that radiation dose reduction down to 1% of original CT dose levels may be achieved in CT torsion measurements of the lower limb without compromising diagnostic accuracy. Key Points: * Modern CT delivers exceptional high image quality in musculoskeletal imaging, especially for evaluation of osseous structures. * Usually, this high image quality is accompanied by significant radiation exposure to the patient and may not always be required for the intended purpose, e.g., pure delineation of cortical bone of the lower limb. * This study shows the tremendous prospects of radiation dose reduction without compromising diagnostic confidence in CT torsion measurement of the lower limb.Copyright © 2020, European Society of Radiology.",Excluded
160,"Anaplastic thyroid cancer in British Columbia 1985-1999: A population-based study Aims: To review the outcome of patients diagnosed with anaplastic thyroid carcinoma in British Columbia between January 1985 and December 1999. Material(s) and Method(s): Seventy-five patients were identified. Survival curves were calculated using Kaplan-Meier estimates, and the charts of the 62 patients referred to a British Columbia Cancer Agency (BCCA) facility were reviewed. Result(s): All cases: 51 out of 75 patients (68%) were women; median age of all patients was 74 years. The overall- and cancer-specific 5-year survival rates for the whole group were 5%. Non-referred cases: nine out of 13 patients were women; median age at diagnosis 84 years. Eleven of the 13 patients died within 1 month of diagnosis. Referred cases: 42 out of 62 patients were women; median age 72 years; median survival 5.1 months; 1-year survival 19%. Forty-eight patients presented with tumours that extended through the thyroid capsule, 10 presented with distant metastases. Four patients had a total thyroidectomy, nine a partial thyroidectomy, and 49 a biopsy only. Fifty-seven patients received radiotherapy, nine of these had concurrent chemotherapy: Thirty-three patients received less than 40 Gy and 24 patients received 40 Gy or more. Median survival was longer (9 vs 3 months) in patients receiving 40 Gy or more; this group included four patients who had prolonged survival. Conclusion(s): Long-term, disease-free survival was achieved in a few patients who were able to receive high-dose radiotherapy, preferably after adequate surgery. © 2005 The Royal College of Radiologists.

Two hundred and sixty two (31.8%) of the diabetics had shoulder calcification compared with 33 (10.3%) of the control group, with a preponderant localisation in the right shoulder. Diabetes of long duration treated with insulin for a long time was associated with a larger percentage of shoulder calcifications. These data and previous laboratory findings suggest a possible pathogenetic correlation between the prevalence of calcific shoulder tendinitis and diabetes.",Excluded
624,"Cerebral computed tomographic angiography using third-generation reconstruction algorithm provides improved image quality with lower contrast and radiation dose PURPOSE: We hypothesized that cerebral CT angiogram performed using third-generation reconstruction algorithm and lower contrast dose-low-kVp technique (LD-CTA) will provide better image quality when compared with regular contrast dose CTA at 120 kVp using a sinogram-affirmed iterative reconstruction algorithm (ND-CTA)., METHODS: Retrospective imaging review of 100 consecutive patients (50 each in LD- and ND-CTA groups). Two readers independently assessed the subjective image quality across multiple vascular segments on a Likert-like scale. Differences in contrast dose, CT dose index (CTDI), and dose length product (DLP) were compared using Mann-Whitney U test. Fisher's exact test was used to compare subjective image quality. Similarly, contrast- and signal-to-noise ratios (CNR and SNR) were compared in the mid-M1 MCA vessels bilaterally and the mid-basilar artery using Mann-Whitney U test. Interclass correlation coefficient (ICC) was calculated for the SNR/CNR values., RESULTS: Both observers showed excellent correlation in subjective image quality (mean percentage agreement of 95.2% for group 1 versus 89.2% for group 2). LD-CTA group showed better SNR and CNR (p < 0.0001) for both MCA vessels and the mid-basilar artery. Interclass correlation coefficient showed moderate correlation (0.51-0.63) between readers. LD-CTA group also used lower contrast (49 cc versus 97 cc in ND-CTA) and had lower radiation exposure (DLP/CTDI for both groups 268.3/80.7 vs 519.5/36.08, both < 0.0001)., CONCLUSION: Next-generation reconstruction algorithm and low-kV scanning significantly improved image quality on cerebral CTA images despite lower contrast dose and, in addition, have lower radiation exposure.",Excluded
477,"Infrastructure of radiotherapy in the Netherlands: Evaluation of prognoses and introduction of a new model for determining the needs Background and purpose: In the Netherlands, the radiotherapy infrastructure is regulated by a Governmental license system. This requires timely and realistic prognostication of the needs for radiotherapy. In the present study, the latest prognoses (1993) and the realized changes in infrastructure are evaluated and a new prognosis for the period until 2010, which has been calculated using a new model, is presented. Material(s) and Method(s): Data on cancer incidence and use of radiotherapy were obtained from various published national reports and from a survey of all radiotherapy departments. Result(s): The cancer incidence over the period 1993-1997 was about 10% higher than predicted. In 1996 and 1997, the percentage of new cancer patients treated with radiotherapy was 45.6 and 48.2%, respectively. The absolute number of newly irradiated patients was about 10% higher than foreseen in the prognosis. The needs for radiotherapy infrastructure not only depend on epidemiological data and changes in indications for radiotherapy, but also on changes in types of treatment with different workloads. A new model, which uses four categories for teletherapy and four categories for brachytherapy is described and a new prognosis for the required number of linear accelerators and staff up to the year 2010 is presented. Conclusion(s): The original prognosis on cancer incidence and radiotherapy patients underestimated the actual figures considerably. The new prognosis, based on a model, which not only accounts for an increase in number of patients, but also for changes in treatment techniques, is expected to more accurately predict and acquire the required radiotherapy capacity. © 2003 Elsevier Science Ireland Ltd.

121,"Human dosimetry and preliminary tumor distribution of 18F- fluoropaclitaxel in healthy volunteers and newly diagnosed breast cancer patients using PET/CT 18F-fluoropaclitaxel is a radiolabeled form of paclitaxel, a widely used chemotherapy agent. Preclinical data suggest that 18F-fluoropaclitaxel may be a reasonable surrogate for measuring the uptake of paclitaxel. As a substrate of P-glycoprotein, a drug efflux pump associated with multidrug resistance, 18F-fluoropaclitaxel may also be useful in identifying multidrug resistance and predicting tumor response for drugs other than paclitaxel. Method(s): After informed consent was obtained, 3 healthy volunteers and 3 patients with untreated breast cancer (neoadjuvant chemotherapy candidates, tumor size > 2 cm) received an intravenous infusion of 18F-fluoropaclitaxel and then underwent PET/CT. Healthy volunteers underwent serial whole-body imaging over an approximately 3-h interval, and organ 18F residence times were determined from the time-activity curves uncorrected for decay to determine dosimetry. Radiation dose estimates were calculated using OLINDA/EXM software. For breast cancer patients, dynamic imaging of the primary tumor was performed for 60 min, followed by static whole-body scans at 1 and 2 h after injection. Result(s): Dosimetry calculations showed that the gallbladder received the highest dose (229.50 muGy/MBq [0.849 rad/mCi]), followed by the small and large intestines (161.26 muGy/MBq [0.597 rad/mCi] and 184.59 muGy/MBq [0.683 rad/mCi]). The resultant effective dose was 28.79 muGy/MBq (0.107 rem/mCi). At approximately 1 h after injection, an average of 42% of the decay-corrected activity was in the gastrointestinal system, with a mean of 0.01% in the tumor. All 3 breast cancer patients showed retention of 18F-fluoropaclitaxel and ultimately demonstrated a complete pathologic response (no invasive cancer in the breast or axillary nodes) to chemotherapy that included a taxane (either paclitaxel or docetaxel) at surgical resection. The tumor-to-background ratio increased with time to a maximum of 7.7 at 20 min. Conclusion(s): This study demonstrates the feasibility of using 18F-fluoropaclitaxel PET/CT tumor imaging and provides radiation dosimetry measurements in humans. Although further study is needed, it is hoped that the measured intratumoral 18F-fluoropaclitaxel distribution can serve as a surrogate for paclitaxel, and potentially other chemotherapeutic agent retention, in solid tumors.

777,"Predictors of Late Cardiovascular Complications in Survivors of Hematopoietic Cell Transplantation Long-term survival after hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) is now an expected outcome. The growing population of survivors is at risk of developing treatment-related complications, including cardiovascular disease (CVD). A nested case-controlled design was used to identify clinical and treatment-related risk factors for development of late (1+ years after HCT) CVD. Cases were identified from a cohort of 1+-year survivors who underwent transplantation at City of Hope between 1977 and 2006. Controls (HCT survivors without CVD) were matched on age, year of HCT, type of HCT, and duration of follow-up. Sixty-three patients with late CVD were identified, 44 (69.8%) with a coronary artery event and 19 (30.2%) with a cerebrovascular event. Median age at HCT was 49.0 years. Median age at onset of late CVD was 54.0 years; 66.7% of the affected patients had undergone autologous HCT. Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that the presence of multiple cardiovascular risk factors (2 or more of the following: obesity, dyslipidemia, hypertension, and diabetes) after HCT was associated with a 5.2-fold increased risk of late CVD (P < .01), and that pre-HCT chest radiation exposure was associated with a 9.5-fold greater risk of coronary artery disease (P = .03). Pre-HCT exposure to chest radiation and the presence of comorbidities were primarily responsible for the risk associated with late CVD after HCT. These data form the basis for developing predictive models for identifying high-risk individuals for targeted surveillance and aggressive management of comorbidities. © 2010 American Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation.",Excluded
1170,"Does the Gamma Knife dose rate affect outcomes in radiosurgery for trigeminal neuralgia? OBJECT: The object of this study was to determine whether the radiation dose rate affects clinical outcomes in patients who undergo stereotactic Gamma Knife surgery (GKS) to manage typical trigeminal neuralgia (TN)., METHODS: The authors retrospectively studied pain relief in 165 patients with medically intractable TN, who underwent 80-Gy GKS using a single 4-mm collimator between 1994 and 2005. No patient had received prior radiation treatment. The measured relative helmet output factor of the Gamma Knife was 0.8 throughout this interval, and the dose rate varied from 1.21 Gy/minute to 3.74 Gy/minute (median 2.06 Gy/minute). Irradiation time varied from 26.73 to 95.11 minutes. The authors divided patients into a low-dose-rate (LDR) group, in which the dose rate varied from 1.21 to 2.05 Gy/minute, and a high-dose-rate (HDR) group, in which the dose rate varied from 2.06 to 3.74 Gy/minute. Post-GKS, the patients' pain control was determined using the Barrow Neurological Institute (BNI) pain scale. There was no statistically significant difference between groups with respect to history of prior microvascular decompression (p = 0.410) or peripheral neuroablative procedures (p = 0.583). The length of symptoms in patients varied from 3 to 414 months with a median of 84 months (p = 0.698). Median follow-up was 26 months with a maximum of 139 months., RESULTS: Initial pain relief was obtained in 71% of patients in the LDR group and 78% in the HDR group (p = 0.547). Patients who initially obtained improved pain relief (BNI Scores I-IIIa) after GKS maintained pain control for median durations of 52 months (LDR group) and 54 months (HDR group) (p = 0.403). New or increased facial sensory dysfunction was found in 14.5% of patients in the LDR group and in 19.3% of patients in the HDR group (p = 0.479)., CONCLUSIONS: The authors found that the GKS dose rate did not affect pain control or morbidity within the range of 1.21-3.74 Gy/minute. Cobalt 60 source decay did not affect outcomes of GKS for TN pain management, even for dose rates approximating a 2-half-life decay of the isotope.",Excluded
897,"Machine learning applied on chest x-ray can aid in the diagnosis of COVID-19: a first experience from Lombardy, Italy BACKGROUND: We aimed to train and test a deep learning classifier to support the diagnosis of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) using chest x-ray (CXR) on a cohort of subjects from two hospitals in Lombardy, Italy., METHODS: We used for training and validation an ensemble of ten convolutional neural networks (CNNs) with mainly bedside CXRs of 250 COVID-19 and 250 non-COVID-19 subjects from two hospitals (Centres 1 and 2). We then tested such system on bedside CXRs of an independent group of 110 patients (74 COVID-19, 36 non-COVID-19) from one of the two hospitals. A retrospective reading was performed by two radiologists in the absence of any clinical information, with the aim to differentiate COVID-19 from non-COVID-19 patients. Real-time polymerase chain reaction served as the reference standard., RESULTS: At 10-fold cross-validation, our deep learning model classified COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 patients with 0.78 sensitivity (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.74-0.81), 0.82 specificity (95% CI 0.78-0.85), and 0.89 area under the curve (AUC) (95% CI 0.86-0.91). For the independent dataset, deep learning showed 0.80 sensitivity (95% CI 0.72-0.86) (59/74), 0.81 specificity (29/36) (95% CI 0.73-0.87), and 0.81 AUC (95% CI 0.73-0.87).

Methods and materials Patients were required to have locally advanced T1-T3 resectable pancreatic cancer. Gemcitabine, given twice weekly before irradiation as a 30-min infusion, was tested at 3 dose levels: 20, 50, and 100 mg/m2. The radiation dose was 50.4 Gy (ICRU) in 28 fractions. The targeted irradiation volume included the tumor, edema, and a 1-cm margin. Results Twenty-eight of 34 patients was eligible for analysis of the treatment. The median age was 67 years (range 38-82). Six patients had T1, 9 had T2, and 19 had T3 diseases (AJCC). Dose-limiting toxicities were Grade 4, fatigue and nausea; Grade 3, thrombocytopenia, diarrhea, and infection. The MTD established was at the 50-mg/m2 gemcitabine dose. A total of 21 of 28 patients underwent surgery: 18 had pancreaticoduodenectomy, 2 had total pancreatectomy, and 1 for palliative surgery. At the time of analysis, 13 of 28 (46%) were disease-free. The estimated median survival was 25 months and overall survival rate at 2 years (Kaplan-Meier) was 55%.

1091,"670 nm light mitigates oxygen-induced degeneration in C57BL/6J mouse retina BACKGROUND: Irradiation with light wavelengths from the far red (FR) to the near infrared (NIR) spectrum (600 nm -1000 nm) has been shown to have beneficial effects in several disease models. In this study, we aim to examine whether 670 nm red light pretreatment can provide protection against hyperoxia-induced damage in the C57BL/6J mouse retina. Adult mice (90-110 days) were pretreated with 9 J/cm2 of 670 nm light once daily for 5 consecutive days prior to being placed in hyperoxic environment (75% oxygen). Control groups were exposed to hyperoxia, but received no 670 nm light pretreatment. Retinas were collected after 0, 3, 7, 10 or 14 days of hyperoxia exposure (n = 12/group) and prepared either for histological analysis, or RNA extraction and quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR). Photoreceptor damage and loss were quantified by counting photoreceptors undergoing cell death and measuring photoreceptor layer thickness. Localization of acrolein, and cytochrome c oxidase subunit Va (Cox Va) were identified through immunohistochemistry. Expression of heme oxygenase-1 (Hmox-1), complement component 3 (C3) and fibroblast growth factor 2 (Fgf-2) genes were quantified using qPCR., RESULTS: The hyperoxia-induced photoreceptor loss was accompanied by reduction of metabolic marker, Cox Va, and increased expression of oxidative stress indicator, acrolein and Hmox-1. Pretreatment with 670 nm red light reduced expression of markers of oxidative stress and C3, and slowed, but did not prevent, photoreceptor loss over the time course of hyperoxia exposure., CONCLUSION: The damaging effects of hyperoxia on photoreceptors were ameliorated following pretreatment with 670 nm light in hyperoxic mouse retinas. These results suggest that pretreatment with 670 nm light may provide stability to photoreceptors in conditions of oxidative stress.",Excluded

312,"Characteristics of photopheresis treatments for the management of rejection in heart and lung transplant recipients Photopheresis has been used in the management of rejection of heart and/or lung transplants. Although its mechanism of action remains unknown, irradiated T-helper cell-induced immunosuppression is the main theory. Since transplant recipients are often lymphopenic and lymphocytes are the target cells in photo-therapy, we performed this study to determine which factors affect the cellular yield to undergo irradiation. We reviewed the records of all photophereses performed in our institution between July 1998 and April 2000 using the UVAR (first generation) or XTS (second generation) instruments (Therakos, Exton, PA). Our data included patient's blood volume, absolute lymphocyte count and hematocrit, catheter type, flow rate of collection cycles and centrifuge bowl size, as well as volume, hematocrit, and lymphocyte count of the cell suspension. With a mixed model multivariate analysis we sought to determine which variables predicted the lymphocyte yield. A total of 406 procedures in 25 adult patients was analyzed. There was no significant difference between the lymphocyte yield among the procedures performed with the first- and the second-generation instruments. The patient's absolute lymphocyte count was the only parameter, which positively correlated with the total number of lymphocytes collected for irradiation (P < 0.0001).

696,"A noninvasive objective measure of sunscreen use and reapplication OBJECTIVES: To study whether a noninvasive swabbing technique can detect sunscreen use for up to 6 hours, and whether the technique can detect reapplication of sunscreen., METHODS: Thirty volunteer office workers were randomly assigned to have one of a variety of sunscreens applied using recommended application techniques, and half were randomly assigned to have sunscreen reapplied after 3 hours. Alcohol-based swabs were used to obtain a sample from participants' arm at 20 minutes, and hourly from 1 to 6 hours post-application. Absorption readings were analyzed using an UV-visible spectrophotometer., RESULTS: The swabbing technique was consistently able to distinguish the sunscreen from control swabs for up to 6 hours. The absorption readings between 20 minutes and 6 hours were significantly higher than control swabs. There were no differences between the group that had sunscreen reapplied and the group that did not., CONCLUSION: The sunscreen swabbing technique is an effective noninvasive method for detecting a variety of sunscreen products in adults over a 6-hour period. No differences in absorption readings were found with sunscreen reapplication. This procedure will be a useful adjunct to other objective measures of sun protection and UV radiation exposure, resulting in a more accurate picture of the sun protection habits of individuals.",Excluded

METHOD(S):: Five patientsE charts were retrospectively reviewed. The main outcome measures were visual acuity and mean central retinal thickness. RESULT(S):: All patients received a radiation dose of 60 cobalt gray equivalent. Radiation macular edema occurred within a mean time of 26 months after irradiation. Mean preinjection visual acuity was 41 Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study letters. Mean central retinal thickness was 487.1 mum. Two months after injection, mean visual acuity was 47 Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study letters. It improved for 3 patients (+4, +9 and, +15 letters) and remained unchanged for 2. Mean central retinal thickness was 331 mum. It decreased for 4 patients (-111,-134,-336, and-187 mum). Two patients underwent a second injection of dexamethasone performed 5 months after the first injection. The gain of visual acuity was +8 and +23 letters with a decrease in central retinal thickness of 158 and 262 mum, respectively. Intraocular pressure increased for 1 patient over a mean follow-up period of 6.4 months. CONCLUSION(S):: Intravitreal dexamethasone implant can improve visual acuity in radiation macular edema.

509,"[Clinical study of adrenal imaging with 123I-labeled-6 beta-iodomethyl-19-norcholesterol (author's transl)] Although adrenal scintigraphy with 131I-6 beta-iodomethyl-19-norcholesterol (NCL-6-131I) was used for the first noninvasive imaging of the adrenal glands, it has the disadvantages. These are: (i) relatively high radiation dose to patients, (ii) the long time required for completion of the scan. To solve these problems, 123I-labeled 6 beta-iodomethyl-19-norcholesterol (NCL-6-123I) was synthesized and was used for adrenal scintigraphy in 6 cases. Successful images were obtained with 185 MBq (5 mCi)-260 MBq (7 mCi) of NCL-6-123I, and optimal time required for the satisfactory scan was 2-3 days after the administration. The estimate radiation dose was reduced by using 185 MBq (5 mCi) of NCL-6-123I instead of 18.5 MBq (0.5 mCi) of NCL-6-131I. From the result of this clinical study, NCL-6-123I was preferred for the adrenal scintigraphy.",Excluded
1208,"Indoor exposure to 222Rn: a public health perspective The objective of this study was to assess the lung cancer risk resulting from indoor radon exposure in the province of Quebec, Canada, and to evaluate the efficacy of mitigation measures to reduce this exposure. Concentrations of radon were determined in a representative sample of houses, and the corresponding lung cancer risk estimates were generated using the BEIR IV model, taking into account smoking, residential mobility, and regional variations in radon concentrations. Mean (geometric) radon concentrations in basements (n = 418) and on first floors (n = 319) were, respectively, 34.4 (95% CI-30.6 to 38.8) and 16.5 Bq m(-3) (14.2 to 19.3). A total of 109 deaths from lung cancer are predicted to occur as a result of this exposure in a cohort of 60,000 people. Detecting all residences with high radon concentrations (equal to or above 200 Bq m(-3)) and implementing mitigation measures in each of them would reduce by 4 the number of lung cancer deaths attributable to indoor radon exposure. A reduction of 0.05% in the prevalence of smoking would prevent as many deaths from lung cancer as would radon mitigation. From a public health perspective, in order to reduce mortality from lung cancer, most efforts should be focused on smoking, not on the relatively minor and hardly preventable population risk arising from household radon exposure.",Excluded
855,"Physicochemical properties of calcific deposits isolated from porcine bioprosthetic heart valves removed from patients following 2-13 years function The purpose of this study was to characterize the physicochemical properties of calcific deposits that cause the failure of tissue-derived heart valve bioprostheses. This was done in an effort to understand the mechanism of pathologic biomineralization in the cardiovascular system and potentially prevent deterioration of bioprostheses. Calcific deposits taken from 10 failed bioprosthetic valves that had been implanted in patients for 2-13 years were characterized by chemical analysis, x-ray diffraction, FTIR spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy, polarized light microscopy, and solubility measurements. The combined results identified the biomineral as an apatitic calcium phosphate salt with substantial incorporation of sodium, magnesium and carbonate. The average Ca/PO4 ratio for this young"" pathologic biomineral was approximately 1.3, considerably lower than approximately 1.7 found in mature atherosclerotic plaque biomineral and mature skeletal biomineral, both of which approximate hydroxyapatite in composition. Deproteinated calcific deposits from bioprostheses had thermodynamic solubilities comparable to those of both atherosclerotic plaque, typical pathologic biomineral and hydrolyzed octacalcium phosphate (OCP, Ca4H(PO4)3 x 2.5 H2O), a proposed precursor phase to biomineral apatite. This later finding, together with chemical composition and structural details of the bioprosthetic deposits themselves, supports a mechanism of cardiovascular calcification in which OCP plays a crucial role in the formation of the final apatitic phase. This suggests an approach toward prevention of bioprosthetic tissue calcification through control of the formation of the kinetically favored OCP precursor and/or its transformation into bioapatite.""",Excluded
2,"Distal radius morphometry of Indonesian population Background: Distal radius morphometry (radial inclination, palmar tilt, radial height, and ulnar variance) is an important parameter in the evaluation and treatment of distal radius fractures in which anatomical alignment must be corrected. Currently, treatment of distal radius fractures in Indonesia is still based on morphometry of western population or from the contralateral side. The aim of this study is to determine distal radius morphometry of Indonesian population and to compare between right and left side, male and female gender. Method(s): Distal radius morphometry was measured from 400 plain X-ray of right and left wrist AP and lateral projection. Samples were taken consecutively in Moh. Ridwan Meuraksa Army Hospital, Jakarta, from June to September 2010. Radial inclination, palmar tilt, radial height, and ulnar variance was measured. Data were recorded using tables and grouped between male and female, right and left side, statistical analysis was performed using Mann-Whitney test. Result(s): From 400 plain X-ray evaluated, there were 300 males and 100 females with the mean age of 25.5 years old (18-48). The mean of radial inclination was 23.99 +/- 3.75degree, palmar tilt 13.76 +/- 4.36degree, radial height 11.31 +/- 1.66 mm, and ulnar variance -0.45 +/- 2.03 mm. There were statistically significant differences between right and left side of radial inclination, palmar tilt, radial height, and ulnar variance. There was also statistically significant difference between male and female. Conclusion(s): Distal radius morphometry of Indonesian population may provide valuable data for the treatment of distal radius fractures. The use of contralateral side as reference should be reconsidered.Copyright © 2013, Faculty of Medicine, Universitas Indonesia. All rights reserved.",Excluded

721,"Radiation-induced bystander effects in vivo are sex specific Ionizing radiation (IR) effects span beyond the area of direct exposure and can be observed in neighboring and distant naive cells and organs. This phenomenon is termed a 'bystander effect'. IR effects in directly exposed tissue in vivo are epigenetically mediated and distinct in males and females. Yet, IR-induced bystander effects have never been explored in a sex-specificity domain. We used an in vivo mouse model, whereby the bystander effects are studied in spleen of male and female animals subjected to head exposure when the rest of the body is protected by a medical-grade lead shield. We analyzed the induction of DNA damage and alterations in global DNA methylation. Molecular parameters were correlated with cellular proliferation and apoptosis levels. The changes observed in bystander organs are compared to the changes in unexposed animals and animals exposed to predicted and measured scatter doses. We have found the selective induction of DNA damage levels, global DNA methylation, cell proliferation and apoptosis in exposed and bystander spleen tissue of male and female mice. Sex differences were significantly diminished in animals subjected to a surgical removal of gonads. These data constitute the first evidence of sex differences in radiation-induced bystander effects in mouse spleen in vivo. We show the role of sex hormones in spleen bystander responses and discuss implications of the observed changes.",Included
949,"A new diagnosis standard for enterovesical fistula in crohn's disease by intracavitary contrast-enhanced ultrasound Enterovesical fistula is a relatively rare condition complicating Crohn's disease (CD), often requiring surgical treatment [1]. Ascertaining the presence of fistula and visualization of its anatomy are important for undertaking a decision for surgery and may impact the operative strategy. However, conventional x-ray studies often fail to demonstrate the fistula tract. Ultrasonography (US), computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance (MR) imaging have a high sensitivity and specificity for the diagnosis of intra-abdominal fistulas, with similar diagnostic accuracies [2]. However, these methods may still fall short of detection of occult and complex fistulas and/or delineating their tracts. Intra-cavitary contrast-enhanced ultrasound (IC-CEUS) was recently proved useful for detecting biliary tract and perianal fistula by locally-injected contrast agent [3-4]. Compared with CT and MR, IC-CEUS has the advantages of non-ionizing radiation and cost-efficacy. We describe the feasibility of IC-CEUS for detection of entero-vesical fistula in a patient with CD using surgery as reference standard. Our center is one of the starting area of the first domestic CD bowel ultrasound unit, has accumulated more than 600 cases, this paper reviews the literature at home and abroad, and combined with the ultrasonic diagnosis and the experience with abdominal abscess on CD interventional therapy - catheter drainage in 30 cases is discussed.",Excluded
354,"Left bundle branch block and suspected myocardial infarction: Does chronicity of the branch block matter? Background: Our aim was to investigate if patients with suspected myocardial infarction (MI) and a new or presumed new left bundle branch block (nLBBB) were treated according to the ESC reperfusion guidelines and to compare them with patients having a previously known LBBB (oLBBB). Furthermore, we investigated the prevalence of ST-segment concordance in this population. Method(s): Retrospective data was collected from the Swedeheart registry for patients admitted to the cardiac care unit at Orebro University Hospital with LBBB and suspected MI during 2009 and 2010. The patients were divided in two age groups; <80 or >=80 years and analysed for LBBB chronicity (nLBBB or oLBBB), MI, and reperfusion treatment. We also compared our data with the national Swedeheart database for 2009. Result(s): A total of 99 patients fulfilled the inclusion criteria. A diagnosis of MI was significantly more common in the group >=80 years compared to the group <80 years (53.8 vs. 25%, p=0.007). The rate of MI was similar in the groups with nLBBB and oLBBB (33 and 37% respectively, p=0.912). Of the 36 patients with a final diagnosis of MI, only eight (22%) had nLBBB. Reperfusion treatment, defined as an acute coronary angiography with or without intervention, was significantly more often performed in patients with nLBBB compared to patients with oLBBB (42 vs. 8%, p<0.001). The rate of MI and reperfusion treatment did not differ between our institution and the Swedish national data. ST-concordance was present in only two cases, one of which did not suffer an MI. Conclusion(s): The proportion of patients receiving reperfusion treatment was low, but higher in nLBBB, reflecting a partial adherence to the guidelines. We found no correlation between LBBB chronicity and MI. Furthermore, only a minority of the MIs occurred in patients with nLBBB. ST-concordance was found in only one of 36 MI cases, indicating lack of sensitivity for this test. © The European Society of Cardiology 2013.",Excluded

Pre- and post-surgical study Objective: The aim of this study was to characterize regional cerebral blood flow in patients with Adult Hydrocephalus Syndrome (AHS) and to evaluate the changes in brain perfusion after surgical derivation treatment. Patients and Methods: 20 patients with AHS (age: 72 +/- 14, 12 men) were studied before and six months after surgery. All patients underwent a brain perfusion SPECT (99mTc-HMPAO) prior to surgery and at 6 months post-surgery. Semi-quantitative analysis was done for brain uptake: 0 = Normal, 1 = Mild, 2 = Moderate, 3 = Severe, 4 = No uptake. The severity of ventricular dilatation was assessed by classifying the intensity and extension of subcortical defects: 0 = Normal, 1 = Mild, 2 = Moderate, 3 = Severe. The scores of the pre- and post-surgical studies were compared using the Student-t test. Result(s): A global reduction of brain uptake was observed (mean score 12.85), mainly in frontal, parietal and temporal lobes, with a significant improvement in post surgical studies (mean score 6, p < 0,001). After surgery, 16 (80 %) of the 20 patients improved brain uptake. In relationship to subcortical uptake, 5 patients showed mild defects, 9 moderate defects and 6 patients presented severe uptake reduction. In post-surgical studies 15 (75%) patients improved almost one degree in the subcortical score and 65 % of the patients showed a normal or mild subcortical uptake reduction.

A thermolucent digital dosimeter was worn at chest level without a lead apron. Dosimeter readings and distance from the spine surgeon were recorded. RESULTS .: Average surgeon exposure was 44.22 +/- 17.4 murem (range: 17.71-70.76 murem). The mean distance from the O-ARM was 4.56 +/- .32 m, and the surgeon was exposed for an average of 19.6 +/- 5.7 seconds (range: 8.05-28.7 s). The annual number of necessary procedures required to surpass the exposure limit, according to the data presented here, would be 113,071 operations using O-ARM. Hence, the number of necessary procedures for O-ARM use is predicted to be 1,130,710 annual procedures to reach the occupational exposure limits for extremity, skin, and all other organs and 339,213 procedures to reach the limits for the lens of eye., CONCLUSION: Radiation exposure is minimal to the surgical team during routine use of the O-ARM imaging system.

853,"Spin echo functional MRI in bilateral auditory cortices at 7T: An application of B1 shimming Ultra high fields (UHF) permit unprecedented explorations of functional organizations and insight into basic neuronal processes. Increases in the signal and contrast to noise ratios have allowed increases in the spatial resolution of T2* weighted gradient echo (GE) echo planar imaging (EPI). Furthermore, while the use of T2 weighted imaging methods at UHF (e.g. spin echo (SE) EPI, gradient and spin echo (GRASE) EPI) can also permit higher resolution images, they in addition allow for increased spatial specificity of functional responses, permitting the in-vivo study of functional organizations down to the columnar level of the cortex. The study of the visual cortex has, thus far, benefitted the most from higher resolution T2 weighted studies as achieving the required transmit B1 magnitude at 7T is more challenging in other brain regions, such as the auditory cortex. As such, auditory fMRI studies at UHF have been limited to T2* weighted GE sequences. Recent advances in multi-channel RF transmission (e.g. B1 shimming) have enabled procedures to efficiently address deficiencies in transmit B1 profiles. However, these techniques, shown to be advantageous in anatomical imaging at UHF, are not generally utilized to facilitate T2 weighted fMRI studies.Here we investigate the feasibility of applying B1 shimming to achieve efficient RF transmission in the human auditory cortex. We demonstrate that, with B1 shimming, functional responses to simple tones and to complex sounds (i.e. voices, speech, animal cries, tools and nature) can be efficiently measured with T2 weighted SE-EPI in the bilateral human auditory cortex at 7T without exceeding specific absorption rate (SAR) limits. © 2012 Elsevier Inc.",Excluded

72,"Effect of oral administration of Hypericum perforatum extract (St. John's wort) on skin erythema and pigmentation induced by UVB, UVA, visible light and solar simulated radiation Hypericin from St John's wort (Hypericum perforatum L.) is a photosensitizing agent that may cause a severe photodermatitis when higher amounts of St John's wort are ingested by animals. Although Hypericum extracts are widely used in the treatment of depressive disorders, only a little information on the photosensitizing capacity of St John's wort in humans is available. In the present prospective randomized study we investigated the effect of the Hypericum extract LI 160 on skin sensitivity to ultraviolet B (UVB), ultraviolet A (UVA), visible light (VIS) and solar simulated radiation (SIM). Seventy two volunteers of skin types II and III were included and were divided into six groups, each consisting of 12 volunteers. In the single-dose study the volunteers (n = 48) received 6 or 12 coated tablets (5400 or 10800 mug hypericin). In the steady-state study the volunteers (n = 24) received an initial dose of 6 tablets (5400 mug hypericin), and subsequently 3 x 1 tablets (2700 mug hypericin) per day for 7 days. Phototesting was performed on the volar forearms prior to medication and 6 h after the last administration of Hypericum extract. The erythema-index and melanin-index were evaluated photometrically using a mexameter. After both single-dose and steady-state administration, no significant influence on the erythema-index or melanin-index could be detected, with the exception of a marginal influence on UVB induced pigmentation (p = 0.0471) in the single-dose study. The results do not provide evidence for a phototoxic potential of the Hypericum extract LI 160 in humans when administered orally in typical clinical doses up to 1800 mg daily. This is in accordance with previous pharmacokinetics studies that found hypericin serum and skin levels after oral ingestion of Hypericum extract always to be lower than the assumed phototoxic hypericin threshold level of 1000 ng/mL.

The MFD schedule was designed to achieve higher tumour concentrations of cisplatin at the time of irradiation by reducing the number of radiation treatment weeks from 7 to 3, allowing recovery from side-effects of both irradiation and cystostatic drugs during the rest periods, while keeping the same total dose and overall treatment time. Patients were randomised between a conventional fractionation scheme (CF) of 70 Gy in 7 weeks with 2 Gy per fraction with a daily dose of 6 mg/m2 cisplatin and a modified fractionation scheme (MFD) delivering three fractions of 1.6 Gy per day, in weeks 1, 4 and 7, keeping the same overall treatment time and total dose. In the modified treatment regime, a daily dose of 10 mg/m2 cisplatin was administered. 53 patients were entered in this trial and radiotherapy was given according to the schedule to all patients in both treatment arms. Cisplatin was given during the whole course of radiotherapy to only one quarter of the patients in the CF arm, stopping mostly after 5-6 weeks due to bone marrow depression and kidney toxicity, while patients in the MFD arm received it according to schedule. No difference was observed in acute and late toxicity in both treatment arms, while a similar or even better tumour response was obtained with MFD.

66,"Occipitocervical fixation in the management of craniocervical instabilities Introduction: The occipitocervical junction presents a unique, complex, biomechanical interface between the cranium and the upper cervical spine. Occipitocervical fixation has undergone significant evolution due to advances in operative techniques and instrumentation techniques. Objective(s): This study was done to evaluate clinical picture, radiographic findings and results of occipitocervical fusion in 10 patients with craniocervical instabilities. Also to compare these results with other results reported in the literature. Method(s): This retrospective study reviewed 10 patients who underwent occipitocervical fixation for craniocervical instabilities between April 2007 and October 2010 in Alexandria hospitals. There were 7 males and 3 females and their ages ranged from 16 to 63. years with mean age of 42.1. years. As regards the clinical presentation, all patients had presented with neck pain before surgery, 8 patients (80%) with myelopathy, and 8 patients (80%) had presented with a neurological deficit either motor or sensory or both. The etiologies of occipitocervical instability in this study were trauma in three patients, rheumatoid arthritis in three patients, tumor in two patients and Down syndrome in two patients. All patients had preoperative craniocervical plain X-ray, CT and MRI examination. All patients underwent occipitocervical fixation surgery with various fixation systems and autologous bone grafts for fusion. Fusion was assessed by plain cervical X-ray films and CT scan, and the neurological outcome by Frankel grade. The mean follow-up period was 14.7. months (range, 4-24. months) including both clinical and radiological examinations. Result(s): There were no operative mortalities or vascular injuries in this series. Two patients showed transient neurological deterioration postoperatively that had resolved within three months. Two cases had superficial wound infection and one case had cerebrospinal fluid leak. The mean operation time was 207. min (range 130-320. min) and the mean volume of blood loss was 354. mL (range 120-750. mL). Neck pain improved in all patients and no new instability developed at adjacent levels. Regarding the Frankel grade, five patients had shown improvement (Three patients improved from Frankel grade C to grade D, one patient from grade A to grade B and one patient from grade D to grade E), while five patients remained stationary at the same grade. At the last follow-up examination period, a solid fusion was achieved in nine patients out of ten (90%). Conclusion(s): Occiptocervical fixation is indicated in the management of craniocervical instabilities resulting from trauma, rheumatoid arthritis, tumors and congenital anomalies of the craniocervical junction. Accurate imaging studies and proper patient selection are the keys to a successful outcome. Occipitocervical fusion procedures can be performed with low morbidity.

In study 2, 26 patients received a continuous course of 74.4 Gy of HFRT with concurrent weekly paclitaxel (50 mg/m) and cisplatin (30 mg/m). Result(s): Tumor locations included oropharynx 48%, hypopharynx 24%, larynx 12%, paranasal sinuses 7%, salivary gland 2%, oral cavity 2% and unknown primary 5%. In study 1, all patients received 3 to 4 cycles of chemotherapy and completed the programmed radiotherapy course. In study 2, 69% received 5 to 6 cycles of chemotherapy and 92% completed the irradiation. Overall, 93% of objective responses were observed (complete 76%, partial 17%). Median follow-up was 50 months (range: 12-97). Pattern of recurrence was local 8%, distant 13%, and combined 3%. Acute toxicity grades 3 to 4 in studies 1 and 2 was 75% and 88%, respectively (P = ns). Globally, 5-year overall survival were 68%, with a median of 71 months (range: 50-91). On multivariate analysis, male gender (P = 0.04) and complete response (P = 0.01) were predictive of improved survival. Conclusion(s): HFRT combined with cisplatin and paclitaxel is very active but at the expense of severe toxicity. Efficacy and toxicity in studies.1 and 2 were not different despite completely different treatment strategies (chemotherapy dose intensity vs. radiotherapy dose intensity).

408,"The usefulness of a prospective ECG gated CT angiography by 256 MDCT: Feasibility and image quality Purpose: To evaluate the usefulness of a prospectively gated transverseaxial scan (PGT) by 256-slice multidetector-row CT (MDCT) coronary angiography compared with a retrospectively gated helical scan (RGH) in patients with atypical chest pain who visited emergency room. Method(s): Between December 2009 and January 2010, among 70 consecutive patients with atypical chest pain who visited ER who performed with 256-slice CT scanner, we included the patients with heart rate (HR) of <= 75 bpm and HR variation <= 10 bpm. Therefore, we included 24 patients obtaining with PGT (mean age, 58.8+/-16.2 years; 12 men and 12 women) and 24 patients obtaining with RGH (mean age, 57.2+/-14.5 years; 12 men and 12 women). Scan was obtained from apex to kidney level. For each of 15 segments indentified according to the American Heart association's segmental model, image quality was evaluated by a radiologist using a four point grading scale: grade 4, excellent and no motion artifacts; grade 3, good and minor stairstep or motion artifacts; grade 2, moderate and presenting artifacts but still diagnostic; and grade 1, poor and not diagnostic. For each scan, radiation dose and additional extracardiac findings were estimated. Diagnostic accuracy was also evaluated the 2 patients performed conventional angiography. The image quality results between PGT and RGH scans were compared using Mann-Whitney Test. Result(s): No statistically significant differences were evident between these two groups in terms of clinical and demographic characteristics. The difference of image quality between PGT and RGH scans was not statistically significant (p = 0.5843). The image quality was regarded as grade 4 for most segments in both PGT (96.7%, 348/360) and RGH scans (98.9%, 356/360). Mean effective radiation dose was 10.4+/-1.2 mSv in patients with PGT as compared to 23.0+/-4.6 mSv in patients with RGH. Additional extracardiac findings are 10 cases in patients with PGT including lung nodule, thyroid nodule. Conclusion(s): Prospective ECG-gated CTA by using the PGT is useful for patients with atypical chest pain who visited ER because it can reduce radiation dose to 54.8% while maintaining image quality and diagnostic accuracy in patients with HR less than 75 bpm, and evaluate the coronary arteries, aorta, pulmonary arteries, and entire intra-thoracic structures at the same time.",Excluded
1117,"Volumetric modulated arc therapy with flattening filter free beams for isolated abdominal/pelvic lymph nodes: Report of dosimetric and early clinical results in oligometastatic patients Background: SBRT is a safe and efficient strategy to locally control multiple metastatic sites. While research in the physics domain for Flattening Filter Free Beams (FFF) beams is increasing, there are few clinical data of FFF beams in clinical practice. Here we reported dosimentric and early clinical data of SBRT and FFF delivery in isolated lymph node oligometastatic patients. Method(s): Between October 2010 and March 2012, 34 patients were treated with SBRT for oligometastatic lymph node metastasis on a Varian TrueBeamTM treatment machine using Volumetric Modulated Arc Therapy (RapidArc). We retrospectively evaluated a total of 25 patients for isolated lymph node metastases in abdomen and/or pelvis treated with SBRT and FFF (28 treatments). Acute toxicity was recorded. Local control evaluation was scored by means of CT scan and/or PET scan. Result(s): All dosimetric results are in line with what published for the same type of stereotactic abdominal lymph node metastases treatments and fractionation, using RapidArc. All 25 FFF SBRT patients completed the treatment. Acute gastrointestinal toxicity was minimal: one patient showed Grade 1 gastrointestinal toxicity. Three other patients presented Grade 2 toxicity. No Grade 3 or higher was recorded. All toxicities were recovered within one week. The preliminary clinical results at the median follow up of 195 days are: complete response in 12 cases, partial response in 11, stable disease in 5, with an overall response rate of 82%; no local progression was recorded. Conclusion(s): Data of dosimetrical findings and acute toxicity are excellent for patients treated with SBRT with VMAT using FFF beams. Preliminary clinical results showed a high rate of local control in irradiated lesion. Further data and longer follow up are needed to assess late toxicity and definitive clinical outcomes. © 2012 Alongi et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",Excluded
1128,"Acute effects of the electromagnetic waves emitted by mobile phones on attention in emergency physicians STUDY OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to investigate the acute effects of the electromagnetic waves (EMW) emitted by mobile phones on attention in emergency physicians., METHODS: This single-center, prospective, randomized, double-blinded clinical study was performed among emergency physicians in a tertiary hospital. Thirty emergency physicians were enrolled in the study. Initial d2 test was applied in the evaluation of attention and concentration of all the physicians, who were randomly assigned into one of two groups. The control group members hold mobile phones in 'off' mode to their left ears for 15min. The members of the intervention group hold mobile phones in 'on' mode to their left ears for 15min, thus exposing them to 900-1800MHz EMW. The d2 test was re-applied to both groups after this procedure. Differences in attention and concentration levels between the groups were compared., RESULTS: Difference between initial and final d2 test in total performance (TN-E, p=0.319), in total number of figures marked (TN, p=0.177), in test performance percentile (PR, p=0.619) and in attention fluctuation (FR, p=0.083) were similar between the groups. However, difference in the number of figures missed (E1 selective attention, p=0.025), difference between numbers of incorrectly marked figures (E2, p=0,018) and difference in focus levels (E, p=0.016) were significantly in favor of the intervention group., CONCLUSION: According to our study findings, the EMW emitted by mobile phones has no deleterious effect on the attention and concentration levels of emergency physicians, and even has a positive impact on selective attention levels.

548,"Trends in computed tomography utilization rates: a longitudinal practice-based study OBJECTIVES: Computed tomography (CT) use has increased dramatically over the past 2 decades, leading to increased radiation exposure at the population level. We assessed trends in CT use in a primary care (PC) population from 2000 to 2010., METHODS: Trends in CT use from 2000 to 2010 were assessed in an integrated, multi-specialty group practice. Administrative data were used to identify patients associated with a specific primary care provider and all CT imaging procedures. Utilization rates per 1000 patients and CT rates by type and medical specialty were calculated., RESULTS: Of 179,032 PC patients, 55,683 (31%) underwent CT. Mean age (SD) was 31.0 (23.6) years; 53% were female patients. In 2000, 178.5 CT scans per 1000 PC patients were performed, increasing to 195.9 in 2010 (10% absolute increase, P = 0.01). Although utilization rates across the 10-year period remained stable, emergency department (ED) CT examinations rose from 41.1 per 1000 in 2000 to 74.4 per 1000 in 2010 (81% absolute increase, P < 0.01). CT abdomen accounted for more than 50% of all CTs performed, followed by CT other (19%; included scans of the spine, extremities, neck and sinuses), CT chest (16%), and CT head (14%). Top diagnostic CT categories among those undergoing CT were abdominal pain, lower respiratory disease, and headache., CONCLUSIONS: Although utilization rates across the 10-year period remained stable, CT use in the ED substantially increased. CT abdomen and CT chest were the two most common studies performed and are potential targets for interventions to improve the appropriateness of CT use.",Excluded
411,"Parkinson's disease: a test of the multifactorial etiologic hypothesis We studied the relative etiologic importance upon the development of Parkinson's disease (PD) of occupational exposure to herbicides and other compounds, ionizing radiation exposure, family history of PD and essential tremor, smoking, and history of various viral and other medical conditions. We identified patients (n = 130) with neurologist-confirmed idiopathic PD through contacts with Calgary general hospitals, long-term care facilities, neurologists, the Movement Disorder Clinic, and the Parkinson's Society of Southern Alberta, and selected two matched (by sex and age +/- 2.5 years) community controls for each case by random digit dialing. We obtained lifetime work, chemical, radiation, medical, and smoking exposure histories and family histories of PD and essential tremor by personal interviews, and analyzed the data using conditional logistic regression for matched sets. After controlling for potential confounding and interaction between the exposure variables, using multivariate statistical methods, having a family history of PD was the strongest predictor of PD risk, followed by head trauma and then occupational herbicide use. Cases and controls did not differ in their previous exposures to smoking or ionizing radiation; family history of essential tremor; work-related contact with aluminum, carbon monoxide, cyanide, manganese, mercury, or mineral oils; or history of arteriosclerosis, chicken pox, encephalitis, hypertension, hypotension, measles, mumps, rubella, or Spanish flu. These results support the hypothesis of a multifactorial etiology for PD, probably involving genetic, environmental, trauma, and possibly other factors.",Excluded

1089,"Predictors and clinical significance of local recurrence in extremity soft tissue sarcoma Background. Limb salvage surgery (LSS) has gained widespread acceptance as the current treatment for treating extremity soft tissue sarcoma (STS) and has been greatly refined since its inception. Combined with improved adjuvant treatment modalities, rates of local relapse have greatly decreased. Nonetheless, local recurrence still occurs and identifying the cause and the subsequent effects of local recurrence can provide valuable insights as LSS continues to evolve. Methods. This retrospective study evaluated 278 patients treated for STS of the extremities between 2000 and 2006. Of these, 41 patients developed a local recurrence while 247 did not. Tumor characteristics and prognostic outcomes were analyzed. Wilcoxon rank sum test and either chi or Fisher's exact was used to compare variables. Kaplan Meier and Gray's test for cumulative risk were also performed. Results. Patients who had a positive margin were 3.76 times more likely to develop local recurrence when compared to those with negative margins. This corresponds to a 38% risk of local recurrence if the margins were positive after six years vs. 12% if the margins were negative. In patients who underwent a re-excision, the presence or absence of residual disease upon re-excision did not have any bearing on local recurrence (p =0.27). In comparing patients with and without local recurrence, there was no statistically significant difference in the rate and the proportion encountering distant metastasis and death due to sarcoma (p >0.05). Conclusions. Despite advancements in surgery, radiation and imaging, positive margins still occur, and the presence of positive margins following definitive treatment continues to remain as a strong predictor for local recurrence. While local recurrence represents a negative outcome for a patient, its impact on future prognosis is influenced by a variety of factors such as time to local recurrence as well as the tumor's inherent biological characteristics. © 2013 Informa Healthcare.",Excluded
1165,"Clinical outcome of stereotactic body radiotherapy for primary and oligometastatic lung tumors: A single institutional study with almost uniform dose with different five treatment schedules Background: To evaluate clinical outcomes of stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) for localized primary and oligometastatic lung tumors by assessing efficacy and safety of 5 regimens of varying fraction size and number. Method(s): One-hundred patients with primary lung cancer (n = 69) or oligometastatic lung tumors (n = 31), who underwent SBRT between May 2003 and August 2010, were included. The median age was 75 years (range, 45-88). Of them, 98 were judged to have medically inoperable disease, predominantly due to chronic illness or advanced age. SBRT was performed using 3 coplanar and 3 non-coplanar fixed beams with a standard linear accelerator. Fraction sizes were escalated by 1 Gy, and number of fractions given was decreased by 1 for every 20 included patients. Total target doses were between 50 and 56 Gy, administered as 5-9 fractions. The prescribed dose was defined at the isocenter, and median overall treatment duration was 10 days (range, 5-22). Result(s): The median follow-up was 51.1 months for survivors. The 3-year local recurrence rates for primary lung cancer and oligometastasis was 6 % and 3 %, respectively. The 3-year local recurrence rates for tumor sizes <=3 cm and >3 cm were 3 % and 14 %, respectively (p = 0.124). Additionally, other factors (fraction size, total target dose, and BED10) were not significant predictors of local control. Radiation pneumonia (>= grade 2) was observed in 2 patients. Radiation-induced rib fractures were observed in 22 patients. Other late adverse events of greater than grade 2 were not observed. Conclusion(s): Within this dataset, we did not observe a dose response in BED10 values between 86.4 and 102.6 Gy. SBRT with doses between 50 and 56 Gy, administered over 5-9 fractions achieved acceptable tumor control without severe complications.Copyright © 2016 Aoki et al.",Excluded

205,"Iodine-125 brachytherapy as upfront and salvage treatment for brain metastases : A comparative analysis BACKGROUND: Outcome and toxicity profiles of salvage stereotactic ablative radiation strategies for recurrent pre-irradiated brain metastases are poorly defined. This study compared risk-benefit profiles of upfront and salvage iodine-125 brachytherapy (SBT) for small brain metastases. As the applied SBT treatment algorithm required histologic proof of metastatic brain disease in all patients, we additionally aimed to elucidate the value of biopsy before SBT., PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients with small untreated (n = 20) or pre-irradiated (n =28) suspected metastases intended for upfront or salvage SBT, respectively, were consecutively included. Temporary iodine-125 implants were used (median reference dose: 50 Gy, median dose rate: 15 cGy/h). Cumulative biologically effective doses (BED) were calculated and used for risk assessment. Treatment toxicity was classified according to Radiation Therapy Oncology Group/European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (RTOG/EORTC) criteria., RESULTS: Upfront SBT was initiated in 20 patients and salvage SBT in 23. In 5 patients, salvage SBT was withheld because of proven radiation-induced lesions. Treatment groups exhibited similar epidemiologic data except for tumor size (which was slightly smaller in the salvage group). One-year local/distant tumor control rates after upfront and salvage SBT were similar (94 %/65 % vs. 87 %/57 %, p = 0.45, respectively). Grade I/II toxicity was suffered by 2 patients after salvage SBT (cumulative BED: 192.1 Gy3 and 249.6 Gy3). No toxicity-related risk factors were identified., CONCLUSION: SBT combines diagnostic yield with effective treatment in selected patients. The low toxicity rate in the salvage group points to protective radiobiologic characteristics of continuous low-dose rate irradiation. Upfront and salvage SBT are similarly effective and safe. Histologic reevaluation should be reconsidered after previous radiotherapy to avoid under- or overtreatment.",Excluded
188,"[Treatment of patients with malignant neoplasms of the nose and paranasal sinuses] The author analyzes and discusses characteristic features of the results of combined treatment in 260 patients with malignant tumours of the superior maxilla, nose and accessory sinuses. The majority of patients were from 40 to 60 years old (81.5%). These were 158 men and 102 women. Epithelial tumours were diagnosed in 91.5%, sarcomas in 8.5% cases. The flattened-cell form of cancer with or without keratosis was diagnosed in 82.7%; other forms of cancer-in 17.3% cases. Sarcoma in women was diagnosed 3.5 times as often as in men. Tumours of the I stage were found in 12, of the II stage in 34. of the III stage in 146, of the IV stage in 73 patients. All patients were subjected to combined treatment-telegammatherapy and resection of the tumour with an electroknife. Patients with cancer of the I stage were first operated on with the electroknife and then subjected to radiotherapy with a focal dose of 3000-4000 rad. The 34 patients with cancer of the II stage underwent preoperative radiotherapy with a focal dose of 4500 to 5000 rad, then surgical intervention followed in 2-5 weeks. Preoperative radiotherapy was practiced in the 146 patients with cancer of the III stage, the total dose per focus being 5000-6000 rad, surgical intervention followed in 3-5 weeks. The 73 patients with cancer of the IV stage were operated on after radiotherapy with a focal dose of 6500-700 rad. Early and remote results of combined treatment in 260 patients were favourable.

360,"Factors associated with presence and extent of coronary calcium in those predicted to be at low risk according to Framingham risk score (from the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis) Even among asymptomatic persons at low risk (<10%) according to the Framingham risk score, high coronary artery calcium (CAC) scores signify a greater predicted risk of coronary heart disease events. We sought to determine the noninvasive factors (without radiation exposure) significantly associated with CAC in low-risk, asymptomatic persons. In a cross-sectional analysis, we studied 3,046 participants from the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis at a low 10-year predicted risk (Framingham risk score <10%) of coronary heart disease events. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was used to assess the association of novel markers with the presence of any CAC (CAC >0) and advanced CAC (CAC >= 300). A CAC level of >0 and of >= 300 was present in 30% and 3.5% of participants, respectively. Factor VIIIc, fibrinogen, and soluble intercellular adhesion molecule were each associated with the presence of CAC (p <= 0.02), and C-reactive protein, D-dimer, and the carotid intima-media thickness with advanced CAC (p <= 0.03). The base model combining the traditional risk factors had excellent discrimination for advanced CAC (C-statistic 0.808). The addition of the 2 best-fit models combining the biomarkers with or without carotid intima-media thickness improved the c-statistic to 0.822 and 0.820, respectively. All 3 models calibrated well but were similar in estimating the individual risk probabilities for advanced CAC (prevalence 9.97%, 10.63%, and 10.10% in the greatest quartiles of predicted probabilities vs 0.26%, 0.26%, and 0.26% in the lowest quartiles, respectively). In conclusion, in low-risk persons, the traditional risk factors alone predicted advanced CAC with high discrimination and calibration. The biomarker combinations with and without carotid intima-media thickness were also significantly associated with advanced CAC; however, the improvement in the prediction and estimation of the clinical risk were modest compared to the traditional risk factors alone.

620,"Escalated-dose versus control-dose conformal radiotherapy for prostate cancer: Long-term results from the MRC RT01 randomised controlled trial Background: The aim of this trial was to compare dose-escalated conformal radiotherapy with control-dose conformal radiotherapy in patients with localised prostate cancer. Preliminary findings reported after 5 years of follow-up showed that escalated-dose conformal radiotherapy improved biochemical progression-free survival. Based on the sample size calculation, we planned to analyse overall survival when 190 deaths occurred; this target has now been reached, after a median 10 years of follow-up. Method(s): RT01 was a phase 3, open-label, international, randomised controlled trial enrolling men with histologically confirmed T1b-T3a, N0, M0 prostate cancer with prostate specific antigen of less than 50 ng/mL. Patients were randomly assigned centrally in a 1:1 ratio, using a computer-based minimisation algorithm stratifying by risk of seminal vesicle invasion and centre to either the control group (64 Gy in 32 fractions, the standard dose at the time the trial was designed) or the escalated-dose group (74 Gy in 37 fractions). Neither patients nor investigators were masked to assignment. All patients received neoadjuvant androgen deprivation therapy for 3-6 months before the start of conformal radiotherapy, which continued until the end of conformal radiotherapy. The coprimary outcome measures were biochemical progression-free survival and overall survival. All analyses were done on an intention-to-treat basis. Treatment-related side-effects have been reported previously. This trial is registered, number ISRCTN47772397. Finding(s): Between Jan 7, 1998, and Dec 20, 2001, 862 men were registered and 843 subsequently randomly assigned: 422 to the escalated-dose group and 421 to the control group. As of Aug 2, 2011, 236 deaths had occurred: 118 in each group. Median follow-up was 10.0 years (IQR 9.1-10.8). Overall survival at 10 years was 71% (95% CI 66-75) in each group (hazard ratio [HR] 0.99, 95% CI 0.77-1.28; p=0.96). Biochemical progression or progressive disease occurred in 391 patients (221 [57%] in the control group and 170 [43%] in the escalated-dose group). At 10 years, biochemical progression-free survival was 43% (95% CI 38-48) in the control group and 55% (50-61) in the escalated-dose group (HR 0.69, 95% CI 0.56-0.84; p=0.0003). Interpretation(s): At a median follow-up of 10 years, escalated-dose conformal radiotherapy with neoadjuvant androgen deprivation therapy showed an advantage in biochemical progression-free survival, but this advantage did not translate into an improvement in overall survival. These efficacy data for escalated-dose treatment must be weighed against the increase in acute and late toxicities associated with the escalated dose and emphasise the importance of use of appropriate modern radiotherapy methods to reduce side-effects.

Method(s): Clinical records of patients with a diagnosis of MCC and with an indication to undergo RT at the European Institute of Oncology between 2003 and 2018 were reviewed retrospectively. Result(s): Twenty-six patients were included in the analysis (median age 65 years, range 42-87). Nineteen received adjuvant RT, 4 exclusive RT, and the remainder palliative RT. Intensity-modulated RT was used in 13 cases, a 3D conformal technique in 11 cases, and stereotactic RT in 2 cases. No major toxicities were recorded. The median relapse-free survival (RFS) after adjuvant RT was 20.5 months, while for unknown primary MCC, it was 23 months. In the adjuvant setting, median polyomavirus-positive RFS was 21.5 months (range 1-49) and median polyomavirus-negative RFS was only 14 months (range 4-45). Overall, RFS of polyomavirus-positive and polyomavirus-negative patients was 10.5 and 8 months, respectively. After adjuvant RT, only 1 out of 10 patients had a recurrence in the RT field. At the time of data collection, 16 patients were alive with no evidence of disease, 1 patient was alive with advanced status of disease, 8 patients died of disease progression, and 1 patient died of other causes. Conclusion(s): The management of unknown primary and polyomavirus-positive cases, which had a better prognosis in our series, may benefit from a multidisciplinary approach, given the limited data available regarding optimal treatment.Copyright © Fondazione IRCCS Istituto Nazionale dei Tumori 2020.",Excluded
13,"Thin-plate spline analysis of the cranial base in African, Asian and European populations and its relationship with different malocclusions OBJECTIVES: To test the hypothesis that midline basicranial orientation and posterior cranial base length are discriminating factors between adults of different populations and its potential maxillo/mandibular disharmonies., DESIGN: Twenty-nine 2D landmarks of the midline cranial base, the face and the mandible of dry skull X-rays from three major populations (45 Asians, 34 Africans, 64 Europeans) were digitized and analysed by geometric morphometrics. We used, first, MANOVA to test for mean shape differences between populations; then, principal components analysis (PCA) to assess the overall variation in the sample and finally, canonical variate analysis (CVA) with jack-knife validations (N=1000) to analyse the anatomical features that best distinguished among populations., RESULTS: Significant mean shapes differences were shown between populations (P<0.001). CVA revealed two significant axes of discrimination (P<0.001). Jack-knife validation correctly identified 92% of 15,000 unknowns. In Africans the whole cranial base is rotated into a forward-downward position, while in Asians it is rotated in the opposite way. The Europeans occupied an intermediate position. African and Asian samples showed a maxillo/mandibular prognathism. African prognathism was produced by an anterior positioned maxilla, Asian prognathism by retruded anterior cranial base and increase of the posterior cranial base length. Europeans showed a trend towards retracted mandibles with relatively shorter posterior cranial bases., CONCLUSIONS: The results supported the hypothesis that basicranial orientation and posterior cranial base length are valid factors to distinguish between geographic groups. The whole craniofacial configuration underlying a particular maxillo-facial disharmony must be considered in diagnosis, growth predictions and resulting treatment planning.",Excluded
907,"Actinic cheilitis: Clinicopathologic profile and association with degree of dysplasia Background: Actinic cheilitis (AC) is a potentially malignant disorder of the lip caused by exposure to solar radiation. Objective(s): This study was conducted to evaluate the clinicopathologic profile of cases of AC and to verify associations with the degree of dysplasia. Method(s): This retrospective study analyzed data for 40 patients with AC. Demographic, clinical, and histopathologic data were evaluated. Sections measuring 5 mum in thickness were cut, deparaffinized, and stained with hematoxylin and eosin for histologic examination. The degree of epithelial dysplasia was graded using the criteria defined by the World Health Organization. Two calibrated oral pathologists analyzed the slides. Result(s): Analysis of the AC patients sampled showed that 75.0% were male (P = 0.002), 80.0% were aged >=40 years (P < 0.001), 74.3% were Caucasian (P = 0.004), and 68.6% had occupational exposure to sunlight (P = 0.028). The most common clinical manifestation was white lesions (55.0%), and 40.0% of patients had no dysplasia. No significant associations emerged between the histologic grading of AC and gender (P = 1.000), age (P = 1.000), ethnicity (P = 0.416), occupational exposure to sunlight (P = 1.000), and clinical presentation (P = 0.467). Conclusion(s): The degree of dysplasia in AC was not statistically associated with gender, age, ethnicity, occupational exposure to sunlight, or clinical appearance. This study provides some support for the hypothesis that clinicopathologic features are not related to the degree of dysplasia in AC. © 2013 The International Society of Dermatology.",Excluded
50,"Fluoroscopy Learning Curve in Hip Arthroscopy-A Single Surgeon's Experience PURPOSE: To determine if (1) absorbed radiation dose and (2) fluoroscopy time decreased with experience over the first 100 cases of a single surgeon's hip arthroscopy practice., METHODS: Subjects who underwent hip arthroscopy for symptomatic femoroacetabular impingement and labral injury were eligible for analysis. Inclusion criteria included the first 100 subjects who underwent hip arthroscopy by a single surgeon (December 2013 to December 2014). Subject demographics, procedure details, fluoroscopy absorbed dose (milligray [mGy]), and time were recorded. Subjects were categorized by date of surgery to one of 4 possible groups (25 per group). One-way analysis of variance was used to determine if a significant difference in dose (mGy) or time was present between groups. Simple linear regression analysis was performed to determine the relation between case number and both radiation dose and fluoroscopy time., RESULTS: Subjects underwent labral repair (n = 93), cam osteoplasty (n = 90), and pincer acetabuloplasty (n = 65). There was a significant (P < .001 for both) linear regression between case number and both radiation dose and fluoroscopy time. A significant difference in mGy was observed between groups, group 1 the highest and group 4 the lowest amounts of radiation (P = .003). Comparing individual groups, group 4 was found to have a significantly lower amount of radiation than group 1 (P = .002), though it was not significantly lower than that of group 2 (P = .09) or group 3 (P = .08). A significant difference in fluoroscopy time was observed between groups, group 1 the highest and group 4 the lowest times (P = .05). Comparing individual groups, group 4 was found to have a significantly lower fluoroscopy time than group 1 (P = .039). Correction for weight, height, and body mass index all revealed the same findings: significant (P < .05) differences in both dose and time across groups., CONCLUSIONS: The absorbed dose of radiation and fluoroscopy time decreased significantly over the first 100 cases of a single surgeon's hip arthroscopy practice learning curve., LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Level IV, therapeutic, retrospective, noncomparative case series.

670,"Multimodal treatment for T1-2 supraglottic cancer: The impact of tumor location Aim: To examine the outcome and prognostic factors after multimodal treatment of T1-2 supraglottic cancer. Patients and Methods: We analyzed 49 patients with T1-2 supraglottic cancer who received multimodal treatment between 1990 and 2011. Their age range was 43-86 years (median=66 years). Fifteen patients had a T1 tumor and 34 had a T2 tumor (40 N0, 3 N1, 4 N2, and 2 N3). Debulking using transoral laser excision was employed in 25 patients. Neck dissection was performed in four patients. Chemotherapy was administered to 29 patients: intra-arterial infusion in four and systemic infusion in 25. Radiotherapy was administered at a median dose of 64.8 Gy (range=30-70 Gy) with once- or twice-daily fractionation. Median follow-up time was 60 months (range=12-153 months). Result(s): Two patients interrupted radiotherapy because of a poor response at 30 Gy (T2N2) and 49.9 Gy (T2N0). They underwent total laryngectomy and were still alive without any evidence of cancer 48 and 28 months after treatment, respectively. The other 47 patients (96%) had a complete local response to treatment. Locoregional failure was observed in six tumor sites, and one patient had simultaneous locoregional recurrence. The 5-year local control, disease-free, overall survival, and laryngeal preservation rates were 82%, 74%, 82%, and 90%, respectively. The location of a primary tumor within the supraglottis (epilarynx or elsewhere) was identified as the only factor predictive of progression-free survival by univariate and multivariate analyses (p=0.04). Acute adverse reactions of grade 3 or more were: one grade 3 laryngeal edema, one grade 3 dyspnea, and one grade 5 hematological toxicity (disseminated intravascular coagulation). Among late adverse events, one grade 1, one grade 2 hoarseness, and grade 3 laryngeal necrosis were observed. Conclusion(s): Multimodal radiotherapy produced a good outcome. Localization of the tumor in the epilarynx was associated with a better progression-free survival rate than that in the other parts of the supraglottis.Copyright © 2014, International Institute of Anticancer Research.

1003,"The value of the initial post-EVAR computed tomography angiography scan in predicting future secondary procedures using the Powerlink stent graft Objective: Current long-term surveillance after endovascular abdominal aortic aneurysm repair (EVAR) is based on high-resolution contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) scans at scheduled, lifelong intervals. The cancer and nephrotoxicity risks of interval CT scanning and prolonged radiation exposure are concerning. We sought to determine if surveillance CT angiography (CTA) can be safely reduced. Method(s): From July 2000 to November 2007, 345 patients were enrolled in U.S. Food and Drug Administration trials of the Powerlink System (Endologix, Irvine, Calif). An independent core laboratory analyzed 1519 post-EVAR CT scans (N = 1519) to 5 years to evaluate aneurysm size, migration, presence of endoleak, and evidence of graft obstruction. Analyses were conducted to determine the value of the initial CTA scan in predicting future secondary procedures in enrolled patients. Result(s): At any time during follow-up, CTA identified endoleak in 123 patients (36%), with 95% of endoleaks being type II. In addition, 49 patients underwent 72 secondary procedures at a mean of 22 +/- 21 months (range, 2-2007 days) after initial EVAR. These were based on clinical identification of limb ischemia in 13 interventions (18%) or core laboratory identification of abnormal CT finding in 58 interventions (81%). Of the 58 core laboratory identified findings, the inciting abnormality was present on the initial postoperative scan in 49 (84%). Of the remaining nine CT-driven procedures, three (5.2%) were due to late sac expansion attributed to type II endoleak (n= 2) or endotension (n= 1); two (3.4%) were for prophylactic reasons in the absence of endoleak; and four (6.8%) were in patients with type II endoleak not observed by the core laboratory and without sac expansion. The negative predictive value of the initial postoperative CTA for the need for a secondary procedure is therefore 96.4%, which can be improved to 97.6% with duplex ultrasound surveillance to detect sac expansion. Thus, a negative initial postoperative CTA is highly predictive of long-term freedom from secondary intervention. Conclusion(s): Among enrolled patients with suitable anatomy for EVAR, most abnormalities that result in a secondary procedure are detected on the initial postoperative CTA or present with clinical symptoms. Long-term surveillance CTA may therefore be replaced by duplex ultrasound imaging if the initial postoperative CTA shows no abnormalities.

117,"Risk Factors for Keratinocyte Carcinoma in Recipients of Allogeneic Hematopoietic Cell Transplants Importance: Allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplant (alloHCT) is known to increase the risk for keratinocyte carcinoma. The extent to which host characteristics, including pigmentary phenotype and UV radiation exposure, contribute is unknown., Objective: To identify and validate independent risk factors for keratinocyte carcinoma after alloHCT, including those associated with the transplant and the host., Design, Setting, and Participants: This retrospective cohort study analyzed a consecutive sample of alloHCT recipients from January 1, 2000, to December 31, 2014, at the Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota (n = 872) and University Hospitals Cleveland Medical Center, Cleveland, Ohio (n = 147). Participants from the Mayo Clinic were randomly allocated (2:1) into discovery (n = 581) and validation (n = 291) cohorts. Time to first keratinocyte carcinoma and information about transplant- and host-associated risk factors were extracted. A multivariate keratinocyte carcinoma risk model was created using a stepwise Cox proportional hazards regression model with P <= .05 for entry that incorporated all covariates that were individually statistically significant at alpha = 0.05 in the discovery cohort. The risk model was first internally validated using the Mayo Clinic validation cohort and then externally validated using the independent cohort of alloHCT recipients at University Hospitals Cleveland Medical Center. Data were analyzed from March 13, 2018, to June 12, 2019., Exposures: Allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplant., Main Outcomes and Measures: The primary outcome was time to development of the first cutaneous keratinocyte carcinoma after alloHCT; secondary outcome, time to development of the first individual basal and/or squamous cell carcinoma after alloHCT., Results: Of the 872 alloHCT recipients identified in the Mayo Clinic cohort (520 men [59.6%]; mean [SD] age, 48.3 [12.6] years), 95 (10.9%) developed keratinocyte carcinoma after alloHCT during 5349 person-years of follow-up. Of the 147 alloHCT recipients in the exernal validation cohort (86 men [58.5%]; mean [SD] age, 47.9 [17.5] years), 18 (12.2%) developed keratinocyte carcinoma after alloHCT in 880 person-years of follow up. Risk factors independently associated with keratinocyte carcinoma after alloHCT included age (hazard ratio [HR] per 10 years, 1.72; 95% CI, 1.21-2.42), chronic lymphocytic leukemia (HR, 2.47; 95% CI, 1.20-5.09), clinically photodamaged skin (HR, 3.47; 95% CI, 1.87-6.41), and history of cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (HR, 2.60; 95% CI, 1.41-5.91). Harrell concordance statistics were 0.81 (95% CI, 0.72-0.90) and 0.86 (95% CI, 0.74-0.98) for internal and external validation of the keratinocyte carcinoma risk model, respectively., Conclusions and Relevance: This study found validated independent risk factors for keratinocyte carcinoma after alloHCT that are enriched with host- compared with transplant-associated risk factors. These findings highlight the importance of assessing host-associated risk factors for keratinocyte carcinoma in patients eligible for alloHCT. Future studies should examine whether keratinocyte carcinoma risk stratification before alloHCT may inform long-term surveillance strategies.",Excluded
718,"Radiation or chemotherapy cystitis with pseudocarcinomatous"" features"" BACKGROUND: The features of radiation or chemotherapy cystitis mimicking invasive urothelial cancer are not widely known., DESIGN: A search of the consultation files from our institution between January 1996 and September 2003 identified 20 patients with bladder biopsies showing cystitis mimicking invasive urothelial cancer., RESULTS: The mean age at diagnosis was 69 years (range, 40-85 years); 80% were males. Complete history was not available in 1 patient. Seventeen patients had a history of pelvic irradiation (15 prostate cancer and 2 endometrial cancer). Two patients had systemic chemotherapy (1 metastatic colon cancer and 1 mixed connective tissue disease). All patients presented with hematuria. The mean time from radiation and/or chemotherapy to presentation was 27 months (range, 0-84 months). All cases showed epithelial proliferation that mimicked invasive cancer within the lamina propria, with marked proliferation seen in 45% of cases. Mild to moderate nuclear pleomorphism was seen in all cases. A characteristic feature was the presence of pseudoinvasive urothelial nests wrapping around the vessels associated with fibrin deposition. Most cases did not show any mitoses (75%). Ulceration was seen in 39% of cases. All cases showed some degree of hemorrhage, fibrin deposition and fibrin thrombi, fibrosis, and acute and chronic inflammation, with hemosiderin identified in 60% of cases. Edema and vascular congestion were common features (95% and 80%, respectively). Thickened vessels and vascular changes associated with radiation injury were identified in 75% of cases. Seventeen patients were followed for a mean of 9 months (range, 0.25-37 months), and none developed bladder cancer., CONCLUSIONS: Radiation or chemotherapy cystitis can show epithelial proliferations that may be confused with invasive urothelial carcinomas. Other findings characteristic of radiation or chemotherapy cystitis, such as hemorrhage, fibrin, and vascular changes, are often seen in association with the epithelial proliferations and are helpful in distinguishing it from invasive cancer. Pathologists must be aware that these changes may be seen with a remote radiation or chemotherapy history, where this information may not be provided or known at the time of the biopsy evaluation.",Excluded
181,"Intramedullary Nailing of Femoral Diaphyseal Metastases: Is it Necessary to Protect the Femoral Neck? Background : Intramedullary nailing is the accepted form of treatment for impending or pathologic fractures of the femoral diaphysis. Traditional teaching promotes the use of a cephalomedullary nail so that stabilization is provided for the femoral neck in the event that a future femoral neck metastasis develops. However, that approach may add cost, surgical time, blood loss, and added radiation exposure to staff members, and there is limited evidence in the literature that supports this practice. Questions/purposes: The purpose of our study was to evaluate the incidence of femoral neck metastases in patients who underwent femoral nailing of diaphyseal metastases. Patients and Methods: Retrospective analysis of our Musculoskeletal Oncology database identified 145 femoral nailings performed for metastatic disease, myeloma, or lymphoma of the femoral diaphysis between 2001 and 2011. Average patient age was 59 years. One hundred forty-one patients underwent 145 femoral nailings (four were bilateral). One hundred forty-four of the nails used were cephalomedullary implants and one was a flexible nail. Thirty-six (25%) femurs had sustained a pathologic fracture and 109 (75%) femurs were treated as impending fractures. Eighty-four patients received either preoperative or postoperative radiation therapy. Average radiographic followup was 13 months and average postoperative survival was 16 months. Of the 141 patients in this series, 121 (86%) are known to have died at a median of 9 months (range, 0.1-133 months) after surgery. The latest followup radiographs were obtained at a median of 5 months after the femoral nailing (range, 0-119 months). Of the 90 patients with documented dates of death and radiographic followup greater than zero months, 76 (84%) had radiographs available within a year of death. Thirty-one patients had zero months radiographic followup. The median survival for this group of patients was only 0.9 months (range, 0.1-12 months). Results : No patients (0%) in this series had femoral neck metastases develop postoperatively. Conclusion : Despite traditional teaching that supports the use of cephalomedullary implants when treating metastatic disease of the femur, we were unable to identify a single patient who had femoral neck metastasis after surgery on the femur. Our findings do not support the use of cephalomedullary implants in this patient population for the sole purpose of prophylactic femoral neck stabilization; however, this series was relatively small, and the experiences of other centers will be needed to come to a more-complete sense of the frequency of what in all likelihood is a rare event.

600,"Selective arterial embolisation for the treatment of mobile spine aneurismal bone cyst: Prospective study Introduzione: Aneurismal Bone Cyst (ABC) is a benign cystic lesion of the bone made of blood containing gaps separated by connective tissue. In 10-30 % of cases ABC is localized at spine level. Different treatment options are possible: 1) curettage and bone grafting; 2) en bloc excision; 3) selective arterial embolization (SAE); 4) radiotherapy; 5) combination of these procedures. The aim of this study is to evaluate prospectively the results obtained using SAE only for the treatment of ABC. Materiali e metodi: 20 patients (9 female, 11 male), mean age 24 years (range: 12-39 years), mean follow up 40 months (range: 9.4- 49.4 months) affected by Aneurismal Bone Cyst of the mobile spine without instability were analyzed. Patients underwent the same diagnostic protocol (X-ray, CT scan, MRI) and the same treatment (selective arterial embolization). The same evaluation protocol was used for all patients (X-ray, CT scan at 8 weeks following embolization). Risultati: From one to seven SAE were performed depending on cases. The mean length of hospital stay was 2.2 days for each embolization treatment (range 2-5 days). 18 patients on 20 were treated using SAE only. In 1 case, presenting progressive paraplegia due to T8 ABC, surgical decompression and T6-T10 fixation were needed. (Frankel E after surgery). After 3 months F.U. local recurrence was observed and it is being treated using SAE. In 1 case, presenting C7 ABC, an Halo Vest was necessary for 30 days, being substituted by a Minerva plaster for three months. 19 patient on 20 are classified as NED (no evidence of disease) at the last F.U. 1 patient as AWD (alive with disease). Discussione e conclusioni: ABC is a benign lesion but in some cases can be locally aggressive causing pain, loss of function, spinal cord, nerve roots or cauda equina compression and pathological fractures. Selective arterial embolization (SAE) was used first as adjuvant procedure to reduce bleeding during surgery. First, De Rosa in 1990 treated ABC using embolization only. Nowadays SAE represents an effective, safe and minimally invasive approach for the treatment of ABC. It could be considered the gold standard treatment for ABC without instability or neurological complications. In the case of failure or poor results surgical treatment must be considered.",Excluded

1193,"Hexagon TB for the rapid diagnosis of lung TBC in praxis Hexagon TB is intended for the rapid diagnostics of tuberculosis. Tuberculosis is a contagious and epidemic disease. According to the data published by WHO, 3-4 millions of patients are diagnosed with this disease annually. In 2004, 107 new cases were discovered in the area of Tuzla Municipality. Annual incidence of this disease is 62,9 per 100 000 inhabitants in Bosnia and Herzegovina; 28,9 in Slovenia; 33,2 in FYRM; 48,5 in Croatia; 41,8 in Serbia and Montenegro. Western European countries have a rather low rate of the disease--5-10 cases per 100 000 inhabitants. Efficiency of Hexagon TB examination method was tested on 100 patients. The subjects were patients with clinical symptoms of active TBC infection, persons who were in contact with TBC patients and persons earlier cured of TBC. All the subjects were tested with Hexagon TB, and the results were compared against lungs X-rays and sputum test for BK and LOW. Hexagon TB is intended for rapid, qualitative detection of IgG, IgA, IgM antibodies against M. tuberculosis and mycobacterium in human serum, plasma or whole blood as an aid in the early diagnostics of tuberculosis infections for professional use. Hexagon TB was positive in 11 of the examined patients. 10 patients had changes suggesting TBC. 1 patient was directly positive for BK and 3 patients were positive for LOW.

1147,"Emotional intelligence may influence the effectiveness of antihypertensive therapy in patients with hypertension Objective: The aim of study was to definite if the emotional intelligence (EI) of patients with arterial hypertension (AH) can influence the effectiveness of antihypertensive therapy. Design and method: We assessed 70 ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM) data of AH patients. ABPM monitor (Spacelabs 90207) was applied after the washout period. We defined daytime period as 8.00-22.00, nighttime - 0.00-6.00, and work period as 11.00-19.00. After ABPM session patients completed the emotional intelligence questionnaire (EmIn) by Lyusin D. We analyzed following EmIn scale scores: I emotion self-awareness; II management of one's own emotions; III control of emotional expression; IV understanding others' emotions; V management of others' emotions. The patients were randomized to treatment antihypertensive drugs. Then the patients were randomized to the control and intervention groups. In the control group patients were given standard recommendations for cardiovascular disease patients. In the intervention group patients were given standard recommendations and advice on lifestyle change according to the results of the EmIn questionnaire. The patients were treated with antihypertensive drugs in average therapeutic doses for 3 weeks (amlodipine, metoprolol, enalapril, telmisartan). In the absence of the therapy effectiveness, the patients began to treatment with the combined therapy, but these data were not included in the analysis. At the end of the three-week therapy was performed EmIn test and ABPM. Result(s): The mean daytime BP was (M +/- SD): systolic (SBP) - 142.1 +/- 14.5; diastolic (DBP) - 90.1 +/- 10.9 mm Hg. In each group there were 35 patients who were comparable in baseline BP, sex, age, EmIn characteristics, body mass index and drugs doses. We found that treatment with average therapeutic doses of antihypertensive drugs is not effective (table 1) in the control group. However, in the intervention group, the same doses of the drug leads to the significant BP reduction of workplace and daytime BP levels. Night BP indices in this patients did not significantly decreased (table 2). Conclusion(s): Thus, lifestyle changes, not only in according to conventional recommendations for cardiovascular patients, but also with regard of test results of emotional intelligence can enhance the effectiveness of antihypertensive therapy.",Excluded
1167,"Three-dimensional surface imaging for detection of intra-fraction setup variations during radiotherapy of pelvic tumors PURPOSE: Surface-based image guided radiotherapy (IGRT) allows positioning and/or monitoring patients in 3 dimensions (3D), without the use of ionizing radiation. In this study, we report on intra-fraction motion measured by acquisition of multiple images of 3D body surfaces., MATERIALS AND METHODS: Twenty-nine patients treated for pelvic tumors were enrolled. Setup variations (SV) through three consecutive body surfaces acquired by the optical IGRT system Align-RT (Vision-RT, London, UK) were analyzed before, during and at the end of treatment delivery. Displacements along the main axes (X, Y and Z) from initial (I) to mid-treatment (MT) and final (F) acquisitions were recorded. Time and direction of SV were assessed., RESULTS: A total of 6272 images from 792 fractions of 29 patients were available. The main source of misalignment was between I and MT acquisition (p < 0.001). The dominant SV direction was the vertical one (Z axis), with mean SV of -1.20 +/- 0.06 mm and -1.55 +/- 0.06 mm for I-MT and I-F acquisitions, respectively. The Y mean components of SV were, respectively, -0.95 +/- 0.10 mm and -1.0 +/- 0.10 for I-MT and I-F acquisitions, while the X deviations were 0.07 +/- 0.08 mm for I-MT and 0.26 +/- 0.08 mm I-F., CONCLUSION: Three-D surface imaging for patient setup monitoring highlighted remarkable mobility of patients during RT session, especially in the anterior-posterior direction (Z axis). The largest magnitude in patient movements occurred during the first part of delivery. These findings suggest that the initial setup control cannot not to be sufficient to guarantee treatment reproducibility, especially for long-lasting RT treatments.",Excluded
289,"Regulation of Nucleolar Dominance Within the Species Drosophila Melanogaster and Within Interspecies Drosophila Hybrids In eukaryotes, ribosomal RNA (rRNA) genes are tandemly repeated, forming ribosomal DNA (rDNA) loci that contain hundreds of rRNA genes to meet the demand of ribosome biogenesis. Individual rDNA loci can be entirely silenced or transcribed (termed nucleolar dominance) to control rRNA dosage. The mechanisms through which rDNA silencing is regulated has been extensively studied, however how or why particular loci are chosen to be silenced/transcribed remain elusive. This dissertation aims to understand how the large-scale silencing of nucleolar dominance is determined and how this choice"" might affect a cell or organism. This dissertation utilizes RNA in situ hybridization techniques and chromosome inversions/translocations to characterize nucleolar dominance within the species D. melanogaster. We show that nucleolar dominance is a developmentally-regulated program in D. melanogaster X/Y males, where the Y rDNA dominates in expression over the X rDNA locus over developmental time and in a tissue-specific manner. We expand on the observation that nucleolar dominance does not typically occur between two X rDNA loci in females across development, and that this difference between male and female nucleolar dominance is not due to cellular sex. We further show that the short arm of the Y chromosome, including its rDNA locus, likely contains elements that dictate its dominant expression over the X rDNA locus. This study on nucleolar dominance in D. melanogaster adds insights into how the ""choice"" of rDNA locus silencing/expression is made.Nucleolar dominance was originally discovered to occur in interspecies hybrids where one species rDNA dominates over another. Whether or not nucleolar dominance is similar within a species and in interspecies hybrids has been extensively studied in Arabidopsis, but has been limited in studies of Drosophila. By utilizing RNA in situ hybridization probes that distinguish rRNA from the closely related species D. melanogaster and D. simulans, we expand on the characterization of nucleolar dominance in Drosophila interspecies hybrids to different stages of development. We find that both rDNA loci in interspecies hybrid Drosophila are expressed in early embryogenesis and that nucleolar dominance (D. melanogaster rDNA dominance and D. simulans rDNA silencing) is established across development, similar to that seen in ""pure species"" Drosophila and Arabidopsis. When D. simulans females and D. melanogaster males form hybrids, the female progeny die during early embryonic divisions as a result of chromosome bridge formation at the large X-chromosome specific heterochromatic block of 359-bp satellite DNA, a satellite DNA specific to D. melanogaster. The D. melanogaster mutant Zhr1, which lacks 359-bp satellite DNA on the X chromosome, is known to rescue this female lethality. This dissertation reveals for the first time that Zhr1-rescued interspecies hybrid females have reversed nucleolar dominance where D. simulans rDNA is expressed and D. melanogaster rDNA is silenced. This dissertation suggests that rDNA and Zhr (359-bp) have a relationship that may connect nucleolar dominance with female lethality seen in these D. melanogaster D. simulans hybrids. This dissertation lays the groundwork to further understand how the organization and function of highly repetitive regions (rDNA) and proximal species-specific satellite DNAs (359-bp) may have relationships that act as barriers between species. In summary, this dissertation begins to uncover the mechanisms underlying nucleolar dominance within the species D. melanogaster and aims to understand how the regulation and divergence of nucleolar dominance and satellite DNAs may have consequences that manifest in barriers between species.

811,"Clinical and lung ultrasonographic features of transient tachypnea of newborn in a tertiary care hospital in Bangalore Introduction: Transient tachypnea of the newborn (TTN) also called wet lung, occurs due to delayed clearance of lung fluid. The diagnosis of TTN was primarily based on medical history, clinical manifestations, arterial blood gas analysis, and chest radiography (CXR). It is estimated that over 70% of infants with TTN are clinically misdiagnosed with Respiratory distress syndrome (RDS). Lung ultrasound (LUS) is an emerging technique that could be used for early detection of TTN. This study aims to evaluate the value of lung ultrasound in the diagnosis of TTN in late-preterm and full-term neonates. Material(s) and Method(s): Sixty five late preterm and term neonates with signs of respiratory distress were included in this prospective observational study from January 2016 to June 2017. Lung ultrasound was done within the first 24 hours of birth and assessed according to the observation indices like A-line, B-line and Double lung point. Result(s): On lung ultrasound, 53 (81.5%) neonates showed the feature of double lung point (DLP) while 41 (63.1%) neonates showed A-line. The respiratory symptoms subsided in 38 (58.4%) babies at room air while only 2 (3.1%) babies required continuous positive airway pressure ventilation. The DLP feature on LUS was significantly more in babies born to primi mothers than multigravida (p value 0.02) and those delivered through LSCS when compared to babies delivered vaginally (p value-0.01). Conclusion(s): TTN is a self-limiting condition and treatment is mainly supportive. The results of this study further demonstrate that LUS can accurately and reliably diagnose TTN. Therefore, significantly reducing the need for chest X-rays and ultimately result in lower exposure of a neonate to ionizing radiation. This will aid in counselling the parents regarding its benign nature and conservative management. Copyright © 2019, Scientific Publishers of India. All rights reserved.",Excluded
55,"Environmental and occupational causes of cancer: new evidence 2005-2007 What do we currently know about the occupational and environmental causes of cancer? As of 2007, the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) identified 415 known or suspected carcinogens. Cancer arises through an extremely complicated web of multiple causes, and we will likely never know the full range of agents or combinations of agents. We do know that preventing exposure to individual carcinogens prevents the disease. Declines in cancer rates-such as the drop in male lung cancer cases from the reduction in tobacco smoking or the drop in bladder cancer among cohorts of dye workers from the elimination of exposure to specific aromatic amines-provides evidence that preventing cancer is possible when we act on what we know. Although the overall age-adjusted cancer incidence rates in the United States among both men and women have declined in the last decade, the rates of several types of cancers are on the rise; some of which are linked to environmental and occupational exposures. This report chronicles the most recent epidemiologic evidence linking occupational and environmental exposures with cancer. Peer-reviewed scientific studies published from January 2005 to June 2007 were reviewed, supplementing our state-of-the-evidence report published in September 2005. Despite weaknesses in certain individual studies, we consider the evidence linking the increased risk of several types of cancer with specific exposures somewhat strengthened by recent publications, among them brain cancer from exposure to non-ionizing radiation, particularly radiofrequency fields emitted by mobile telephones; breast cancer from exposure to the pesticide dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT) before puberty; leukemia from exposure to 1,3-butadiene; lung cancer from exposure to air pollution; non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) from exposure to pesticides and solvents; and prostate cancer from exposure to pesticides, polyaromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), and metal working fluids or mineral oils. In addition to NHL and prostate cancer, early findings from the National Institutes of Health Agricultural Health Study suggest that several additional cancers may be linked to a variety of pesticides. Our report also briefly describes the toxicological evidence related to the carcinogenic effect of specific chemicals and mechanisms that are difficult to study in humans, namely exposures to bis-phenol A and epigenetic, trans-generational effects. To underscore the multi-factorial, multi-stage nature of cancer, we also present a technical description of cancer causation summarizing current knowledge in molecular biology. We argue for a new cancer prevention paradigm, one based on an understanding that cancer is ultimately caused by multiple interacting factors rather than a paradigm based on dubious attributable fractions. This new cancer prevention paradigm demands that we limit exposure to avoidable environmental and occupational carcinogens, in combination with additional important risk factors like diet and lifestyle. The research literature related to environmental and occupational causes of cancer is constantly growing, and future updates will be carried out in light of new biological understanding of the mechanisms and new methods for studying exposures in human populations. The current state of knowledge is sufficient to compel us to act on what we know. We repeat the call of ecologist Sandra Steingraber: From the right to know and the duty to inquire flows the obligation to act.""""",Excluded
622,"Protocol of a thyroid cancer longitudinal study (t-calos): A prospective, clinical and Epidemiological study in Korea Introduction: Thyroid cancer incidence in Korea is the highest in the world and has recently increased steeply. However, factors contributing to this sudden increase have not been fully elucidated, and few studies have explored the postoperative prognosis. The Thyroid Cancer Longitudinal Study (T-CALOS) was initiated with three aims: (1) to identify factors predicting quality of life, recurrence, and incidence of other diseases after thyroid cancer treatments; (2) to investigate environmental exposure to radiation, toxicants and molecular factors in relation to tumour aggressiveness; and (3) to evaluate gene-environment interactions that increase thyroid cancer in comparison with healthy participants from a pool of nationwide population-based healthy examinees. Methods and analysis: T-CALOS enrols patients with incident thyroid cancer from three general hospitals, Seoul National University Hospital, Seoul National University Bundang Hospital and National Medical Center, Korea. The study is an ongoing project expecting to investigate 5000 patients with thyroid cancer up until 2017. Healthy examinees with a normal thyroid confirmed by sonography have been enrolled at the Healthy Examination Center at Seoul National University Hospital. We are also performing individual matching using two nationwide databases that are open to the public. Follow-up information is obtained at patients' clinical visits and by linkage to the national database. For statistical analysis, we will use conditional logistic regression models and a Cox proportional hazard regression model. A number of stratifications and sensitivity analyses will be performed to confirm the results. Ethics and dissemination: Based on a large sample size, a prospective study design, comprehensive data collection and biobank, T-CALOS has been independently peer-reviewed and approved by the three hospitals and two funding sources (National Research Foundation of Korea and Korean Foundation for Cancer Research). The results of T-CALOS will be published according to the Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology (STROBE) criteria.",Excluded
405,"Efficacy of sucralfate ointment in the prevention of acute proctitis in cancer patients: A randomized controlled clinical trial Background: Acute radiation proctitis (ARP) is a usual adverse effect in patients undergoing pelvic radiotherapy. The symptoms include diarrhea, rectal blood or mucus discharge, fecal urgency and tenesmus with pain. Sucralfate, an aluminum-based salt of sucrose octasulfate, is a cytoprotective agent that forms a coating barrier at injured sites by adhering to mucoproteins. It has been used in topical management of a wide variety of local lesion. This study was designed to evaluate the preventive effect of rectal sucralfate on acute radiotherapy induced proctitis. Method(s): Seven percent sucralfate ointment was prepared for topical use. Drug quantification, chemical stability and microbial limit tests were performed carefully. In this randomized double blind placebo controlled trial, fifty-seven patients with pelvic malignancies undergoing radiotherapy were allocated to receive either 1 g of sucralfate or 1 g of placebo, given as a twice daily ointment, one day before and during radiotherapy for six weeks. The eligible patients were evaluated based on RTOG acute toxicity criteria and the following ARP symptoms weekly: Rectal hemorrhage, diarrhea, rectal pain, and fecal urgency. The influence of symptoms on lifestyle was also recorded weekly. Result(s): Acute proctitis was significantly less prevalent in patients in the sucralfate group. The incidence of rectal bleeding (P=0.003), diarrhea (P=0.002), rectal pain (P=<0.001) and fecal urgency (P=0.002) was significantly less common in the sucralfate group. No statistical significant difference was observed for radiotherapy induced cystitis in the placebo and sucralfate groups (P=0.27). Conclusion(s): This study suggests that sucralfate7% ointment reduces the incidence of symptoms associated with acute radiation proctitis.Copyright © 2020, Babol University of Medical Sciences.",Excluded
451,"Radiation protection value to the operator from augmented reality smart glasses in interventional fluoroscopy procedures using phantoms INTRODUCTION: Smart glasses can be adapted to display radiographic images to allow clinician's gaze not to be directionally fixed or predetermined by computer monitor location. This study presents an analysis of eye lens dose during interventional fluoroscopy guided procedures, comparing fixed monitor positions against the use of smart glasses., METHODS: Using a head phantom (simulating the clinician), thermoluminescent dosimeters and lead shielded glasses, the dose to the eye was measured for different head 'rotations and tilts' for: gaze directed towards the main scattering source (patient/primary beam) to represent potential gaze direction if smart glasses are used; gaze directed to a range of potential computer monitor positions. An anthropomorphic pelvis phantom was utilised to simulate the patient. Accumulated dose rates (muGy s-1) from five 10-second exposures at 75 kV 25.2 mAs were recorded., RESULTS: An average DAP reading of 758.84 cGy cm2 was measured during each 10 second exposure. Whilst wearing lead shielded glasses a 6.10 - fold reduction in dose rate to the lens is possible (p < 0.05). Influence of the direction of gaze by the clinician demonstrated a wide range of dose rate reduction from 3.13% (p = 0.16) to 143.69% (p < 0.05) when the clinician's gaze was towards the main scattering source. Increased dose rate to the clinician's eyes was received despite wearing lead shielded glasses, as the angle of gaze moved 45degree and 90degree from 0degree., CONCLUSION: If the clinician's gaze is directed towards the main scattering source a potential exists for reducing eye lens dose compared with fixed location computer monitors. Introduction of lead lined smart glasses into interventional radiology may lead to improvements in patient care, reducing the need for the clinician to look away from the patient to observe a radiographic image.

1231,"Radiation therapy for leukemia cutis Purpose: Leukemia cutis (LC) is the infiltration of the epidermis, dermis, or subcutis by neoplastic leukocytes, resulting in clinically identifiable cutaneous lesions. Electron-based radiation therapy (RT) is often used in the treatment of LC; however, modern studies of RT are lacking. We reviewed our experience to analyze treatment response, disease control, and toxicity associated with RT in order to develop treatment recommendations for patients with LC. Methods and Materials: Fifteen patients who underwent treatment for LC at our institution from November 1994 to August 2009 were identified and their medical records were reviewed and analyzed. Result(s): LC presented after a median of 2 (range 0-24) months from acute myeloid leukemia diagnosis. Median survival from time of LC presentation was 23 months (range 0.5-137 months). Thirteen courses of radiation were administered to 12 patients: 9 total skin electron beam (TSEB) therapy and 4 focal treatments. Of patients receiving TSEB, 89% had diffuse LC involvement and 67% were in marrow remission. By contrast, only 25% of patients receiving focal therapy had diffuse LC involvement and only 25% were in marrow remission. Median TSEB dose was 1600 (range 600-2400) cGy. Fifty percent of patients had a complete response to RT but 1-year local control was only 33%. All patients who developed a skin relapse either had active marrow disease at the time of RT or marrow recurrence shortly thereafter. Median survival since RT was 5 (range 0.5-136) months. RT was well tolerated without significant acute effects; however, 1 patient receiving chemotherapy developed radiation recall 1 month after RT. Conclusion(s): Patients with LC have aggressive disease with few long-term survivors. Definitive treatment with TSEB should be utilized only in cases of marrow remission with focal electron therapy reserved for palliation of symptomatic lesions. Long-term prognosis and durable cutaneous remission is dependent on systemic disease control. © 2011 American Society for Radiation Oncology.",Excluded
237,"Disaster preparedness education and a Midwest Regional Poison Center OBJECTIVE: To assess knowledge and comfort related to disaster preparedness and response gained and retained from a disaster medicine workshop given to Certified Specialists in Poison Information (CSPI). DESIGN: A pilot study with a pre-post intervention design. SETTING: A Midwest Regional Poison Center. PARTICIPANTS: All CSPIs employed at the participating Poison Center (N = 27) were recruited. Participation ranged from 44 percent (n = 12) for the 4-month postworkshop knowledge quiz to 78 percent (n = 21) for the preworkshop survey. INTERVENTION: A disaster medicine workshop was given to the CSPIs. Quizzes and surveys were done preworkshop and then repeated at 1 week, 4 months, and 14 months postworkshop. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: CSPI knowledge and comfort pertaining to disaster-related calls. RESULT(S): CSPIs' comfort levels with calls regarding major chemical or nuclear/radiation disasters significantly increased and stayed elevated during all follow-up periods [Kruskal-Wallis chi2 (3) = 13.1, p = 0.01]. The average preworkshop quiz score was 58.2 percent. A statistically significant increase in mean quiz score was demonstrated amongst preworkshop and postworkshop scores at all tested time intervals (F = 18.8, p < 0.001). CONCLUSION(S): CSPIs' knowledge regarding disaster management significantly increased after a disaster medicine workshop, and this knowledge was significantly retained for the 14-month duration of this study. Currently, there are no uniform guidelines for Poison Centers regarding disaster response training. Studies targeted at the development of educational competencies for CSPIs and disaster response would help to standardize this much needed education.",Excluded
472,"Synovial sarcoma presenting as soft tissue rheumatic syndrome: A challenge for the clinician Purpose: Despite of its name, synovial sarcoma (SS) does not have synovial origin; it arises from the primitive mesenchyme of the tendon sheath and fascial aponeurosis. SS is frequently misdiagnosed as a benign soft tissue condition. Will be described clinical and histopathological features of patients with diagnosis of SS, emphasizing those manifestations that may lead to misdiagnosis of soft tissue rheumatism. Method(s): A retrospective chart, imaging and pathological review of consecutive histopathological proved cases of SS, registered between January 2000 to December 2008 at Pathology department. Result(s): 27 patients (17 male 63%; 10 female, 37%). The average age at diagnosis was 28 years (11 - 63 years). Anatomical regions involved were, lower limb in 93% (foot 11, 41%; ankle 4, 15%; knee 4, 15%; thigh 4, 15%; inguinal region 2, 7%) and upper limb in 2, 7%; arm and forearm,). Signs and symptoms at presentation were: pain in all cases, palpable deep-seated swelling or periarticular mass in 22 (81%), decrease range of joint motion in 44%, weight loss in 18%, skin color changes in 7%, and muscle weakness in 4%. Eleven (34%) were initially diagnosed as benign rheumatologic conditions: synovitis in 3 (11%); fasciitis in 2 (7%); Mortonxs neuroma; arthrofibrosis; chronic bursitis, synovial cyst, bunionette, and tarsal tunnel syndrome 1 (4%) instance each. The time elapsed since onset of symptoms to diagnosis was 40 months (1 - 156 months). The more advantageos imaging studies that helped defining the presence of a soft-tissue tumor were MRI, CT-scan, scintigraphy and X-rays. In all cases a biopsy was necessary to confirm diagnosis. Surgical treatment was: amputation in 11 patients (41%), block resection in 6 (22%) and marginal resection in 5 (18.5%). Five patients (18.5%) refused surgical treatment. The size of the tumors ranged from 1-to 12 cm. Histological subtype was identified as monophasic (24/89%) and biphasic (3/11%). Patients were classified according to the TNM system as follows: T1N0M0 19(70%), T2N0M0 2(7%) T2N1M0 1(4%) and T2N1M1 5(19%). They also were categorized according to the IRSG classification as type I in 18 patients (67%), type II in 2 (7%), type III in 6 (22%) and type IV in 1 case (4%). Ten (37%) patients underwent adjuvant chemotherapy and radiotherapy. The average follow-up was 51 months (6-96), local recurrences and metastases were in 7 patients (26%). Fifteen (55.5%) patients were alive and disease free. Conclusion(s): It is essential that the Rheumatologist retain awarness of SS, particularly in young male patients presenting with slow growth, palpable, deep-seated soft tissue swelling or mass in close proximity to joints of the lower extremities. SS should be included in the differential diagnosis of soft tissue rheumatic syndromes.",Excluded
23,"Cone beam computed tomography, a low-dose imaging technique in the postoperative assessment of cochlear implantation BACKGROUND: Cone beam computed tomography (CBCT) has become an extremely useful technique for dentomaxillofacial imaging because it provides clear images of highly contrasted structures. Previous studies evaluating the applicability of this technique in otologic imaging were very encouraging but were only performed in vitro on temporal bone specimens. The intracochlear positioning of the individual electrodes after cochlear implantation by means of CBCT has not yet been shown in vivo., OBJECTIVE: We describe a protocol for in vivo postoperative imaging of cochlear implants by CBCT. Moreover, the effective dose was measured and compared with the effective dose used on 4- and 16-slice multislice computed tomography (MSCT) by using a RANDO-phantom., MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Developing a protocol for in vivo postoperative imaging of cochlear implants by CBCT., RESULTS: CBCT provides high-resolution and almost artifact-free multiplanar reconstruction images allowing assessment of the precise intracochlear position of the electrode and visualization of each of the individual contacts. The calculated effective dose of the used CBCT and MSCT acquisitions is 80 musv for the CBCT, 3,600 musv for the 16-slice computed tomography, and 4,800 musv for the 4-slice computed tomography., CONCLUSION: These preliminary results suggests that, for in vivo postoperative evaluation of cochlear implants, CBCT can provide at least the same information as conventional radiography, digital radiograph, and MSCT but in a more comfortable and a much more safer way.",Excluded
1142,"AN INTERVENTIONAL CARDIOLOGY INVESTIGATION: PATIENT EXPOSURE TO RADIATION AND INTER-OPERATOR VARIABILITY IN AN IRISH SETTING AIM: To evaluate patient radiation exposure for Diagnostic Coronary Angiography (DCA) and Percutaneous Cardiac Intervention (PCI) performed by different operators. METHODS AND RESULTS: Retrospective (n = 160) and prospective (n = 62) data for DCA (n = 179) and PCI (n = 43) examinations performed by interventional cardiologists (n = 3) using the same imaging equipment were reviewed. The operator with consistently low diagnostic reference levels (DRLs) was interviewed for their personal perceptions upon operator training. Retrospective Median [IQR] DAP was 18.8 [11.8-31.6] and 50.7 [35.3-85.6] Gy.cm2 for DCA and PCI, respectively. Prospective Median [IQR] DAP for DCA and PCI was 7.9 [5.2-10.6] and 15.9 [10.0-17.7] Gy.cm2, respectively. DRLs were within Irish and European DRLs; however, significant inter-operator variability (p < .001) was identified. CONCLUSION(S): Radiation exposure in Interventional cardiology is highly operator dependent; further research is warranted in standardization of operator training with evolving technologies.Copyright © The Author(s) 2020.

798,"Bath-water PUVA therapy with 8-methoxypsoralen in mycosis fungoides PUVA therapy is widely used for early stage mycosis fungoides. While the efficacy of PUVA with oral 8-methoxypsoralen (8-MOP) is well documented, the use of its topical variation, bath-water PUVA therapy with 8-MOP has not been studied. The purpose of this study was to assess the effect of 8-MOP bath-water PUVA therapy in adult patients with early stage mycosis fungoides. We retrospectively evaluated the outcomes of bath-water delivery of 8-MOP (1 mg l(-1)) in 16 patients with early stage mycosis fungoides. In all patients complete response was achieved after a mean duration of 63 days requiring 29 treatments and a mean cumulative UVA dose of 33 J cm(-2). The time to relapse after complete clinical clearance was 45.6 (+/-9.2) weeks. In comparison, oral PUVA therapy with 8-MOP resulted in complete response after 64.5 days (25.8 treatments) with a mean relapse-free period of 30 (+/-3.5) weeks. We conclude that bath-water PUVA therapy with 8-MOP is a valuable photo-therapeutic alternative, which should be considered for patients in whom systemic psoralen cannot be used.",Excluded
532,"The 975 nm Diode Laser in the Photothermal Treatment of the Aging and Sagging Face and Neck OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to investigate the use of a 975 nm diode laser for skin tightening., BACKGROUND DATA: The photothermal effect of laser irradiation on the hypodermis causes retraction of superficial and deep skin layers by the heating of fibrous septa. New devices have been developed for repairing deformities in the cervicofacial region associated with aging and skin laxity., MATERIALS AND METHODS: This retrospective, cross-sectional study included the medical records of 17 patients who had undergone photothermal laser therapy to correct deformities in the cervicofacial region between June 2013 and February 2015. An energy dose of 3 kJ per 100 cm(2) skin area was used as a safety parameter to calculate the optimal cumulative energy for the treated areas. Four cervicofacial lines were measured preoperatively (baseline), immediately after treatment, and 3 months post-treatment with a caliper. Measurements were compared using the Wilcoxon test at a significance level of 0.05 (p < 0.05)., RESULTS: A significant skin tightening was observed in all patients 3 months after the procedure. Mean length reductions found in the cervicofacial lines L1, L2, L3, and L4 at the 3-month follow-up were 0.9, 1.18, 1.32, and 1.27 cm, respectively., CONCLUSIONS: The use of a 975 nm diode laser resulted in skin tightening.",Excluded
524,"Comparison of computer-aided detection (CADe) capability for pulmonary nodules among standard-, reduced- and ultra-low-dose CTs with and without hybrid type iterative reconstruction technique PURPOSE: To directly compare the effect of a reconstruction algorithm on nodule detection capability of the computer-aided detection (CADe) system using standard-dose, reduced-dose and ultra-low dose chest CTs with and without adaptive iterative dose reduction 3D (AIDR 3D)., MATERIALS AND METHODS: Our institutional review board approved this study, and written informed consent was obtained from each patient. Standard-, reduced- and ultra-low-dose chest CTs (250mA, 50mA and 10mA) were used to examine 40 patients, 21 males (mean age+/-standard deviation: 63.1+/-11.0years) and 19 females (mean age, 65.1+/-12.7years), and reconstructed as 1 mm-thick sections. Detection of nodule equal to more than 4mm in dimeter was automatically performed by our proprietary CADe software. The utility of iterative reconstruction method for improving nodule detection capability, sensitivity and false positive rate (/case) of the CADe system using all protocols were compared by means of McNemar's test or signed rank test., RESULTS: Sensitivity (SE: 0.43) and false-positive rate (FPR: 7.88) of ultra-low-dose CT without AIDR 3D was significantly inferior to those of standard-dose CTs (with AIDR 3D: SE, 0.78, p<.0001, FPR, 3.05, p<.0001; and without AIDR 3D: SE, 0.80, p<.0001, FPR: 2.63, p<.0001), reduced-dose CTs (with AIDR 3D: SE, 0.81, p<.0001, FPR, 3.05, p<.0001; and without AIDR 3D: SE, 0.62, p<.0001, FPR: 2.95, p<.0001) and ultra-low-dose CT with AIDR 3D (SE, 0.79, p<.0001, FPR, 4.88, p=.0001)., CONCLUSION: The AIDR 3D has a significant positive effect on nodule detection capability of the CADe system even when radiation dose is reduced.

241,"Towards the control of chikungunya vector in la Reunion using the sterile insect technique: Sexual competitiveness and mating success of sterilized males Aedes albopictus The sterile insect technique (SIT) is widely used as part of area-wide integrated pest management programs for insects such as fruit fies, screw-worm fies and tsetse fies. It is based on the releases of large numbers of sterile males, which transfer their sterile sperm to wild females for the fertilization of the eggs, resulting in embryonic death. The lack of offspring could then lead to a decrease of the wild population density. The SIT is currently being developed at the FAO/IAEA in Vienna and on La Reunion, France, for the potential control of Aedes albopictus, vector of Chikungunya and secondary vector of Dengue viruses. In this context, we investigated the impact of the sterilisation process on male mating success and sexual competitiveness in the laboratory and under semi-feld conditions. Males from a young laboratory colony (F4) were irradiated as pupae (>20h old) with gamma-rays at 35 or 40 Gy. In the laboratory, the time for male sexual maturation was not affected by the irradiation, neither was the insemination rate of 4 days old males as compared to un-irradiated ones. The daily individual mating success of sterile males during 15 days was reduced as compared to un-irradiated males; however the differences were signifcant only during the second week. Sterility was maintained over successive matings and after a resting period. Under semi-feld conditions, sterile males competed well against wild males, though a resting period of 5 days in the laboratory before release greatly improved their effciency. A ratio of fve sterile to one wild male resulted in a two-fold reduction of the wild females' mean fertility. Valuable information on the effects of the sterilization process was collected and it is suggested that an effcient reduction of a wild population might be achieved by releasing sterile males as adults. Moreover, the results indicate that a resting period allows a recovery from radiation-induced somatic damages which improved the biological quality of the males.",Excluded
993,"Magnetic resonance enterocolonography is useful for simultaneous evaluation of small and large intestinal lesions in Crohn's disease BACKGROUND: We developed novel magnetic resonance enterocolonography (MREC) for simultaneously evaluating both small and large bowel lesions in patients with Crohn's disease (CD). The aim of this study was to evaluate the diagnostic performance of MREC by comparing results of this procedure to those of endoscopies for evaluating the small and large bowel lesions of patients with CD., METHODS: Thirty patients with established CD were prospectively examined by newly developed MREC. Patients underwent ileocolonoscopy (ICS) (24 procedures) or double-balloon endoscopy (DBE) (10 procedures) after MREC on the same day. Two gastroenterologists and two radiologists who were blinded to the results of another study evaluated endoscopy and MREC findings, respectively., RESULTS: In colonic lesions the sensitivities of the MREC for deep mucosal lesions (DML), all CD lesions, and stenosis were 88.2, 61.8, and 71.4%, respectively, while the specificities were 98.1, 95.3, and 97.7%, respectively. In small intestinal lesions, MREC sensitivities for DML, all CD lesions, and stenosis were 100, 85.7, and 100%, respectively, while specificities were 100, 90.5, and 93.1%, respectively. Endoscopic scores were significantly correlated with MREC scores. Eleven (46%) of the 24 patients who were clinically not suspected to show stricture were observed to demonstrate stricture by radiologists., CONCLUSIONS: Our results demonstrated that MREC can simultaneously detect the CD lesions of the small and large intestine. MREC can be performed without radiation exposure, the use of enema, or the placement of a naso-jejunal catheter. MREC and endoscopy have comparable abilities for evaluating mucosal lesions of patients with CD. Copyright © 2010 Crohn's & Colitis Foundation of America, Inc.",Excluded
388,"An alternative approach to account for patient organ doses from imaging guidance procedures PURPOSE: To investigate the feasibility of an alternative method of accounting for additional organ doses resulting from image guidance procedures during patient treatment planning through tabulated values based on scan protocol and scan site., METHODS AND MATERIALS: Patient-specific imaging dose to 30 patients resulting from Varian OBI kV-CBCT scans using the Standard Head (17 patients), Low-dose Thorax (8 patients), and Pelvic (5 patients) scan protocols were retrospectively calculated using Monte Carlo methods. Dose dependence on scan location and patient geometry was explored. Patient organ doses were analyzed by using dose-volume histograms and expressed by the mean, minimum dose delivered to 50% of the organ volume, D50. The reported doses are dose-to-medium instead of dose-to-water., RESULTS: The organ doses from all patient-specific calculations show predictable and limited ranges across patients. For brain isocenters using Standard Head Scans: Bone: 0.7-1.1 cGy, Brain: 0.2-0.3 cGy, Brainstem: 0.2-0.3 cGy, Skin: 0.3-0.4 cGy, Eye: 0.03-0.3 cGy. For head and neck patients using the Standard Head Scan: Bone: 0.3-0.6 cGy, Parotids: 0.3-0.4 cGy, Spinal Cord: 0.15-0.25 cGy, Thyroid: 0.1-0.25 cGy, Skin: 0.2-0.3 cGy, Trachea-Esophagus: 0.1-0.2 cGy. For chest using Thorax Scans: Bone: 1.1-1.8 cGy, Soft tissue organs (Bowel, Lung, Heart, Kidney, Esophagus, and Spinal Cord): 0.3-0.6 cGy. For abdominal site using Pelvic Scans: Bone: 3.2-4.2 cGy. Soft tissue organs (Bladder, Bowel, Rectum, Prostate, and Skin) D50s fell between 1.2 and 2.2 cGy. Femoral Heads: 2.5-3.4 cGy., CONCLUSIONS: It is adequate to estimate and account for organ dose by using tabulated values based on scan procedure and site because organ doses from imaging procedures are only modestly dependent upon scan location and body size. Considering the dose variation and magnitude of dose from each scan protocol in comparison to therapeutic doses, this approach provides a simple alternative to account for additional imaging guidance doses during patient treatment planning. Clinicians can use these tabulated values to make informed decisions in selecting the appropriate imaging procedures and imaging frequency during radiotherapy treatment.

1037,"An essential role for Drosophila hus1 in somatic and meiotic DNA damage responses The checkpoint proteins Rad9, Rad1 and Hus1 form a clamp-like complex which plays a central role in the DNA-damage-induced checkpoint response. Here we address the function of the 9-1-1 complex in Drosophila. We decided to focus our analysis on the meiotic and somatic requirements of hus1. For that purpose, we created a null allele of hus1 by imprecise excision of a P element found 2 kb from the 3' of the hus1 gene. We found that hus1 mutant flies are viable, but the females are sterile. We determined that hus1 mutant flies are sensitive to hydroxyurea and methyl methanesulfonate but not to X-rays, suggesting that hus1 is required for the activation of an S-phase checkpoint. We also found that hus1 is not required for the G2-M checkpoint and for post-irradiation induction of apoptosis. We subsequently studied the role of hus1 in activation of the meiotic checkpoint and found that the hus1 mutation suppresses the dorsal-ventral pattering defects caused by mutants in DNA repair enzymes. Interestingly, we found that the hus1 mutant exhibits similar oocyte nuclear defects as those produced by mutations in DNA repair enzymes. These results demonstrate that hus1 is essential for the activation of the meiotic checkpoint and that hus1 is also required for the organization of the oocyte DNA, a function that might be independent of the meiotic checkpoint.",Excluded
810,"MR-guided breast radiotherapy: feasibility and magnetic-field impact on skin dose The UMC Utrecht MRI/linac (MRL) design provides image guidance with high soft-tissue contrast, directly during radiotherapy (RT). Breast cancer patients are a potential group to benefit from better guidance in the MRL. However, due to the electron return effect, the skin dose can be increased in presence of a magnetic field. Since large skin areas are generally involved in breast RT, the purpose of this study is to investigate the effects on the skin dose, for whole-breast irradiation (WBI) and accelerated partial-breast irradiation (APBI). In ten patients with early-stage breast cancer, targets and organs at risk (OARs) were delineated on postoperative CT scans co-registered with MRI. The OARs included the skin, comprising the first 5 mm of ipsilateral-breast tissue, plus extensions. Three intensity-modulated RT techniques were considered (2x WBI, 1x APBI). Individual beam geometries were used for all patients. Specially developed MRL treatment-planning software was used. Acceptable plans were generated for 0 T, 0.35 T and 1.5 T, using a class solution. The skin dose was augmented in WBI in the presence of a magnetic field, which is a potential drawback, whereas in APBI the induced effects were negligible. This opens possibilities for developing MR-guided partial-breast treatments in the MRL.",Excluded
304,"Comparison between percutaneous and traditional fixation of lumbar spine fracture: Intraoperative radiation exposure levels and outcomes Objective: To compare radiation exposure doses and clinical and radiological outcomes between percutaneous pedicular screwing (closed reduction internal fixation [CRIF]) and classical open reduction internal fixation (ORIF) in lumbar spine fracture without neurologic deficit. Material(s) and Method(s): Sixty patients (mean age, 42.5. years) were divided into two treatment groups: (Percutaneous) CRIF versus (traditional) ORIF. Screw position and anatomic vertebral reconstruction were checked on routine control X-ray and postoperative CT scan. Study parameters comprised: surgery time, radiation exposure time, radiation dose level for X-ray (DAP) and for CT (DLP),blood loss, length of hospital stay and postoperative pain (VAS). Result(s): At a mean 25.5. months' follow-up, there were no significant inter-group differences on the epidemiological parameters: age, gender, fracture level, fracture type on the Magerl classification, preoperative local vertebral kyphosis angle, or fracture-to-surgery interval. Effective radiation dose was 3-fold higher in CRIF than in ORIF, but 6-fold lower than for the postoperative CT scan. Postoperative pain on VAS was significantly lower after CRIF, allowing earlier gait resumption and return to work and daily activity. There were no significant differences in length of hospital stay, patient satisfaction, screw malpositioning or postoperative or end-of-follow-up kyphosis angle. Conclusion(s): Percutaneous surgery provided clinical and radiological outcomes strictly comparable to those of open surgery, but with a higher effective radiation exposure dose, including for the medical team and especially for the surgeon.

199,"Dual-time-point 18F-FDG PET/CT in patients with colorectal cancer: clinical value of early delayed scanning OBJECTIVE: In dual-time-point PET/CT, early delayed scanning (D-1) just after the completion of whole body scanning (E) is easy to perform without additional radiation exposure and repositioning. Our aim was to assess the clinical value of D-1 compared with conventional delayed scanning (D-2)., METHODS: Our institutional review board approved this retrospective study. Fifty-four patients with known or suspected colorectal cancer underwent (18)F-FDG PET/CT at our institution. The E scan at 1-h post-injection was followed by D-1 at 85 +/- 7 min post-injection and D-2 at 124 +/- 7 min post-injection. The clinical value of D-1 was evaluated by comparing diagnostic performance with D-2 for differentiating physiologic from pathological uptake and for staging colorectal cancer. Colonoscopic findings, histopathological results and clinical follow-up including radiological findings were used as reference standards., RESULTS: Thirty-two, eight and 73 focal or short segmental FDG foci by physiologic processes in the colon/rectum, the small intestine and the ureter, respectively, noted in the E scan were evaluated in this study. Using D-1 and D-2, 14/32 (44%) and 17/32 (53%) in the colon/rectum, 5/8 (63%) and 8/8 (100%) in the small intestine, and 55/73 (75%) and 69/73 (95%) in the ureter, respectively, were accurately interpreted as physiologic with the change of intensity and/or shape/location. A significant difference between D-1 and D-2 was observed in the ureter, but not in the bowel. The 55 colorectal cancers were finally diagnosed in 52 patients. In the staging of colorectal cancer, there were no significant differences among the three scans in the lesion-based detectability, the patient-based sensitivity, specificity and accuracy for the identification of primary tumors, nodal and hepatic metastases, and dissemination., CONCLUSIONS: Neither D-1 nor D-2 improved staging of colorectal cancer. However, delayed scans yielded information useful for differentiating physiologic uptake from pathological uptake and D-1 may provide comparable efficacy with D-2 in the bowel. Because of the ease of acquisition, the D-1 scan was considered a practical way to reduce false-positives in the abdomen and possibly helpful to avoid unnecessary additional invasive examinations, such as colonoscopy.",Excluded
128,"Operative management of periarticular medial clavicle fractures - Report of ten cases BACKGROUND: The periarticular medial clavicle fracture is a rare injury and can be treated conservatively in the majority of cases. However, up to 8% of the patients develop symptomatic nonunion, and fracture dislocation correlates with the number of poor functional results. Operative treatment may be beneficial in these cases. Studies with large series of operated patients are still missing. METHOD(S): We investigated 10 patients with operative treatment of periarticular medial clavicle fractures. Preoperative X-ray or computed tomography scan was obtained, and follow-up assessment was performed at determined intervals, including physical examination and X-ray evaluation of bone healing. Finally, functional assessment was carried out from September 2009 to July 2010 using the Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder and Hand score. RESULT(S): All operated patients had displaced periarticular medial clavicle fractures. A direct surgical approach was performed, and denudation of the bone fragments was avoided. In 8 of 10 cases, we used locking plates, preferentially the T-locking plate. In 6 of 10 patients, three screws were placed in the medial fragment or the sternum. The arm was immobilized in a sling for 2 weeks to 3 weeks, followed by careful passive and increasing active motion exercises. In 9 of 10 operated patients, we observed fracture healing and good functional results. Two patients with paraplegia/tetraplegia were excluded from final assessment but demonstrated fracture healing. In one case, we observed early material loosening caused by misused locking system and wound infection. CONCLUSION(S): Operative treatment can be considered for periarticular, dislocated medial-end clavicle fractures. Computed tomography scan can be useful for operative planning and is mostly performed in patients with multiple injuries. Locking plates, such as the T-locking plate or the pilon reconstruction plate, are preferred devices. For rigid fixation, at least three locking screws should be placed in the medial bone fragment. The plate can be removed 18 months after osteosynthesis. Copyright © 2012 by Lippincott Williams & Wilkins.",Excluded
858,"The effect of anatomical modeling on space radiation dose estimates: A comparison of doses for NASA phantoms and the 5th, 50th, and 95th percentile male and female astronauts The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) performs organ dosimetry and risk assessment for astronauts using model-normalized measurements of the radiation fields encountered in space. To determine the radiation fields in an organ or tissue of interest, particle transport calculations are performed using self-shielding distributions generated with the computer program CAMERA to represent the human body. CAMERA mathematically traces linear rays (or path lengths) through the computerized anatomical man (CAM) phantom, a computational stylized model developed in the early 1970s with organ and body profiles modeled using solid shapes and scaled to represent the body morphometry of the 1950 50th percentile (PCTL) Air Force male. With the increasing use of voxel phantoms in medical and health physics, a conversion from a mathematical-based to a voxel-based ray-tracing algorithm is warranted. In this study, the voxel-based ray tracer (VoBRaT) is introduced to ray trace voxel phantoms using a modified version of the algorithm first proposed by Siddon (1985 Med. Phys. 12 252-5). After validation, VoBRAT is used to evaluate variations in body self-shielding distributions for NASA phantoms and six University of Florida (UF) hybrid phantoms, scaled to represent the 5th, 50th, and 95th PCTL male and female astronaut body morphometries, which have changed considerably since the inception of CAM. These body self-shielding distributions are used to generate organ dose equivalents and effective doses for five commonly evaluated space radiation environments. It is found that dosimetric differences among the phantoms are greatest for soft radiation spectra and light vehicular shielding. 2011 Institute of Physics and Engineering in Medicine.",Excluded

The CTO target vessel was the right coronary artery (55%), circumflex (23%), left anterior descending artery (21%), and left main or bypass graft (1%). The retrograde approach was used in 34% of all procedures. The technical and procedural success rates were 85.5 and 84.2%, respectively. The mean procedural time, fluoroscopy time, and contrast utilization were 113 +/- 61 min, 42 +/- 29 min, and 294 +/- 158 mL, respectively. Years since initiation of CTO PCI were independently associated with higher technical success rate (odds ratio [OR] = 1.52, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.52-1.70, P < 0.001), lower fluoroscopy time (OR = 0.84, 95% CI = 0.75-0.95, P = 0.005), and contrast utilization (OR = 0.84, 95% CI = 0.62-0.79, P < 0.001) during the study period., CONCLUSIONS: Among selected US-based institutions performing CTO PCI, we observed a significant reduction in total fluoroscopy time and contrast utilization paralleled with an improved technical success rate over time.

391,"The Association of Socioeconomic Status with the Burden of Cataract-related Blindness and the Effect of Ultraviolet Radiation Exposure: An Ecological Study Objective: To assess the association of socioeconomic status with the burden of cataract blindness in terms of year lived with disability (YLD) rates and to determine whether ultraviolet radiation (UVR) levels modify the effect of socioeconomic status on this health burden. Method(s): National and subnational age-standardized YLD rates associated with cataract-related blindness were derived from the Global Burden of Disease (GBD) study 2017. The human development index (HDI) from the Human Development Report was used as a measure of socioeconomic status. Estimated ground-level UVR exposure was obtained from the Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI) dataset of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA). Result(s): Across 185 countries, socioeconomic status was inversely associated with the burden of cataract blindness. Countries with a very high HDI had an 84% lower age-standardized YLD rate [95% confidence interval ( CI): 60%-93%, P < 0.001] than countries with a low HDI; for high-HDI countries, the proportion was 76% (95% CI: 53%-88%, P < 0.001), and for medium-HDI countries, the proportion was 48% (95% CI: 15%-68%, P = 0.010; P for trend < 0.001). The interaction analysis showed that UVR exposure played an interactive role in the association between socioeconomic status and cataract blindness burden ( P value for interaction = 0.047). Conclusion(s): Long-term high-UVR exposure amplifies the association of poor socioeconomic status with the burden of cataract-related blindness. The findings emphasize the need for strengthening UVR exposure protection interventions in developing countries with high-UVR exposure.Copyright © 2021 The Editorial Board of Biomedical and Environmental Sciences.

Forty million bone marrow cells from male donors were given to female recipients on each of 5 consecutive days, 5 to 10 times the number customarily used in the past. When the recipients were examined 2-13 weeks after the last transfusion, donor cells were found to average 16-25% of total marrow cells. Similar percentages of donor cells were found when variants of the enzyme phosphoglycerate kinase determined electrophoretically were used for identification of donor and recipient cells. Evidence is presented that the proportion of donor cells is compatible with a linear dependence on the number of cells transfused over the range tested--i.e., 20-200 million bone marrow cells injected intravenously. Special proliferative sites thus do not appear to be required.",Excluded
661,"Cost-effectiveness of computed tomography screening for lung cancer in the United States INTRODUCTION: A randomized trial has demonstrated that lung cancer screening reduces mortality. Identifying participant and program characteristics that influence the cost-effectiveness of screening will help translate trial results into benefits at the population level.
METHODS: Six U.S. cohorts (men and women aged 50, 60, or 70 years) were simulated in an existing patient-level lung cancer model. Smoking histories reflected observed U.S. patterns. We simulated lifetime histories of 500,000 identical individuals per cohort in each scenario. Costs per quality-adjusted life-year gained ($/QALY) were estimated for each program: computed tomography screening; stand-alone smoking cessation therapies (4-30% 1-year abstinence); and combined programs.
RESULTS: Annual screening of current and former smokers aged 50 to 74 years costs between $126,000 and $169,000/QALY (minimum 20 pack-years of smoking) or $110,000 and $166,000/QALY (40 pack-year minimum), when compared with no screening and assuming background quit rates. Screening was beneficial but had a higher cost per QALY when the model included radiation-induced lung cancers. If screen participation doubled background quit rates, the cost of annual screening (at age 50 years, 20 pack-year minimum) was below $75,000/QALY. If screen participation halved background quit rates, benefits from screening were nearly erased. If screening had no effect on quit rates, annual screening costs more but provided fewer QALYs than annual cessation therapies. Annual combined screening/cessation therapy programs at age 50 years costs $130,500 to $159,700/QALY, when compared with annual stand-alone cessation.
CONCLUSIONS: The cost-effectiveness of computed tomography screening will likely be strongly linked to achievable smoking cessation rates. Trials and further modeling should explore the consequences of relationships between smoking behaviors and screen participation.",Excluded
402,"Underprediction of visibly complex chromosome aberrations by a recombinational-repair ('one-hit') model Purpose: Published low-LET FISH data were used to test two models of chromosome aberration production based on breakage-and-reunion or recombinational repair. Material(s) and Method(s): Randomness of DNA double strand break induction and misrejoining is analyzed comprehensively and adopted as a working hypothesis. Proximity effects are approximated by using interaction sites. Model results are calculated using CAS (chromosome aberration simulator) Monte Carlo computer software with two adjustable parameters. CAS can emulate the specifics of any experimental painting protocol, allowing very detailed tests of the models. Result(s): To reasonable approximation, breakage-and-reunion model predictions are consistent with low-LET FISH results, including two large, elaborate, one-paint data sets. An explicitly specified version of the recombinational-repair model severely underpredicts the frequency of the visibly complex aberration patterns most commonly observed with one-paint FISH, and is inconsistent with some observed multi-paint patterns. When high-dose effects (distortion and saturation) are taken into account quantitatively, a dose-response relation for apparently simple interchanges slightly favours the breakage-and-reunion model over the recombinational-repair model, despite being approximately linear over the dose range 2-6 Gy. Conclusion(s): The random breakage-and-reunion model gives comprehensive baseline predictions that are sufficiently accurate for the organization of experimental results. The data speak against complex aberrations being formed by the random recombinational repair pathway discussed here.",Excluded
53,"Pyelotransverse pyelocolostomy: an alternative method for high urinary diversion in patients with extended bilateral ureter damage After previous radiation due to pelvic malignoma or after multiple operations, the ileal conduit as well as sigmoid conduit are associated with an increased rate of complications. In these patients, the middle and distal ureter often cannot be considered for reimplantation due to fibrosis. High anastomosis to a bowel segment which is undamaged proves favorable. The transverse colon, conveniently situated in the cranial abdomen, is close enough to the kidneys for such a high anastomosis and is mostly spared from irradiation. In cases where severely damaged ureters forbid connection to a normal transverse conduit, we performed a pyelotransverse pyelocolostomy with high anastomosis of the bowel to both renal pelves or ureteropelvic junctions. 7 patients have been treated in this way and the follow-up of these patients ranges between 14 and 24 months. Postoperatively increased renal function was found in 6 renal units, stable function in 6 renal units, and only 1 patient showed a functional ureteropelvic stenosis. 4 months after the operation 1 patient died of sepsis caused by recurrent urinary tract infections due to recurrent stone disease as a consequence of immobilization in myelomeningocele. In patients with nearly total loss of ureters the pyelotransverse conduit is an effective surgical solution and may prove more comfortable to the patient than bilateral percutaneous nephrostomies.",Excluded
258,"Stimulus intensity affects early sensory processing: visual contrast modulates evoked gamma-band activity in human EEG We studied the effect of different contrast levels on the visual evoked gamma-band response (GBR) in order to investigate whether the GBR is modulated in a similar manner as previously reported for visual evoked potentials. Previous studies showed that the GBR can be modulated by individual characteristics (age) and experimental conditions (task difficulty, attention). However, stimulus properties, such as size and spatial frequency, also have a large impact on the GBR, which necessitates identification and control of relevant stimulus properties for optimal experimental setups. Twenty-one healthy participants were investigated during a forced-choice discrimination task. Sinusoidal gratings were presented at three contrast levels with a constant spatial frequency of 5 cycles per degree visual arc (cpd). The present data replicate the results reported for visual evoked potentials and exhibit a contrast dependent modulation of the GBR. Gamma activity is increased for higher contrast levels. These results demonstrate the importance of stimulus contrast for evoked gamma activity. Thus, it appears meaningful to control the contrast of stimuli in experiments investigating the role of gamma activity in perception and information processing.",Excluded
1027,"Transverse depth-dependent changes in corneal collagen lamellar orientation and distribution It is thought that corneal surface topography may be stabilized by the angular orientation of out-of plane lamellae that insert into the anterior limiting membrane. In this study, micro-focus X-ray scattering data were used to obtain quantitative information about lamellar inclination (with respect to the corneal surface) and the X-ray scatter intensity throughout the depth of the cornea from the centre to the temporal limbus. The average collagen inclination remained predominantly parallel to the tissue surface at all depths. However, in the central cornea, the spread of inclination angles was greatest in the anterior-most stroma (reflecting the increased lamellar interweaving in this region), and decreased with tissue depth; in the peripheral cornea inclination angles showed less variation throughout the tissue thickness. Inclination angles in the deeper stroma were generally higher in the peripheral cornea, suggesting the presence of more interweaving in the posterior stroma away from the central cornea. An increase in collagen X-ray scatter was identified in a region extending from the sclera anteriorly until about 2 mm from the corneal centre. This could arise from the presence of larger diameter fibrils, probably of scleral origin, which are known to exist in this region. Incorporation of this quantitative information into finite-element models will further improve the accuracy with which they can predict the biomechanical response of the cornea to pathology and refractive procedures.",Excluded
974,"Long-term outcome and patterns of failure in primary ocular adnexal MALT lymphoma treated with radiotherapy Purpose/Objective(s): MALT lymphomas have generally been believed to follow a relatively indolent course and show a tendency to remain localized within their original environment for a long period of time. Therefore, there has been no consensus regarding the initial management of primary ocular adnexal MALT lymphoma (POAML) so far; radiotherapy has been generally considered the most effective treatment for localized disease. Although results from local control by radiotherapy were satisfying, disease progression occurred in a fraction of the patients. There have been few analyses on its behavior of progression and death that focused on patients with POAML. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the long-term treatment outcome and disease behavior of POAML. Materials/Methods: Seventy-eight patients (42 male and 36 female) diagnosed with POAML between 1991 and 2010 at Kobe University Hospital were included. The median age was 60-years old (range: 22 - 85). The median radiation dose administered was 30.6 Gy. Survival data were calculated using the Kaplan-Meier method. Result(s): The median follow-up duration was 65 months. Major tumor sites were conjunctivas in 37 (47%), orbita in 29 (37%), and lacrimal glands in 12 (15%) patients. The 5- and 10-year local control (LC) rates were both 100%, and the 5- and 10-year recurrence- free survival (RFS) rates were 88.5% and 75.9%, respectively. The 5- and 10-year overall survival (OS) rates were 98.1% and 95.3%, respectively. Patients treated with a combination of radiotherapy and chemotherapy had a trend for a better RFS compared to those treated with radiotherapy alone (p = 0.114). None developed greater than G2 acute morbidity. For late morbidities, retinal disorders occurred in 7 patients (9%), glaucoma in 1 (1%), dry eye in 4 (5%), and cataracts in 37 (47%).

510,"Changes in lateral dimensions of irradiated volume and their impact on the accuracy of dose delivery during radiotherapy for head and neck cancer BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: To assess changes in lateral dimensions of irradiated volume during head and neck cancer radiotherapy and to determine their impact on the accuracy of dose delivery., PATIENTS AND METHODS: Lateral dimensions of irradiated volumes were measured in five predefined points prior to treatment and then bi-weekly. For each measurement, midline dose was calculated and verified using in vivo dosimetry. Early radiation reactions, patient weight changes and the need to modify radiotherapy accessories were also recorded. The study included 33 head and neck cancer patients irradiated using parallel opposed megavoltage fields., RESULTS: Body mass changes during radiotherapy ranged from -18 to +4 kg (median -5). Lateral dimension changes >5 mm (range -37 to +16) occurred in 32 patients (97%). For axis measurements, the degree of lateral dimension changes were correlated with treatment field size (P = 0.022) and degree of mucositis (P = 0.017). Axis doses calculated for changed dimensions varied from those prescribed by -2.5 to +6% (median +2%). Differences larger than 5% were present in 4.8% of calculations. In 17 patients (52%), radiotherapy accessories had to be modified during treatment. The need to modify radiotherapy accessories correlated with larger treatment portals (P = 0.004), more weight loss during treatment (P = 0.01) and higher initial N stage (P = 0.04)., CONCLUSIONS: Changes of irradiated volume lateral dimensions during head and neck cancer radiotherapy may lead to considerable dose delivery inaccuracies. Watchful monitoring, corrections to calculated dose when changes observed are significant and radiotherapy accessories modification during the course of treatment are strongly recommended.",Excluded
10,"[Osteoradionecrosis in adults] Osteoradionecrosis (ORN) is not exceptional, despite advances in irradiation techniques. Six cases are reported, involving the pelvis, coxofemoral joint, mandible and vertebrae; in this last case, the semiologic value of the lucent intrasomatic image seen on plain films and tomographies of the vertebrae is underscored. The irradiation dose (above 3 000 rad) is the chief factor in osteoradionecrosis, which may be precipitated by adjuvant factors and potentiating events such as trauma and infection. Pathologic study shows several lesions whose association is suggestive: cell lesions, osteoporosis, vascular lesions, and foci of necrosis. The pathogenic significance of lesions of bone cells is demonstrated, while the part played by vascular lesions is controversial. Involvement of the pelvis and hips following irradiation of pelvic carcinoma is the most common. The scapular girdle and ribs may be involved in irradiation for breast cancer. In involvement of the mandible, remarkable features are its frequency following irradiation of carcinoma of the mouth, the significant part played by potentiating factors, i.e. infection and trauma, severity of complications, i.e. fistulae and hemorrhage, and lastly difficulties of management. Among infrequent sites, involvement of the vertebrae is of interest as it may mimic collapse due to osteoporosis or metastasis. Diagnosis rests on an association of criteria, and fortunately bone biopsy is usually unnecessary. The clinical features, topographical characteristics and course of the disease allow differentiation from bone metastasis; it may be more difficult to distinguish postirradiation sarcoma, which is exceptional, or a number of benign conditions, such as aseptic necrosis, infectious osteoarthritis, and destructive coxarthrosis.",Excluded

This study was planned to evaluate upper GI symptoms in patients of CKD and evaluate the effects of haemodialysis, proton pump inhibitors (PPIs), and yoga on these symptoms. Material(s) and Method(s): The present study included 100 patients, of which 75 were patients of CKD with upper GI symptoms and 25 patients with upper GI symptoms without CKD served as controls. 75 cases of CKD were further subdivided into 3 groups - A, B, and C - to see effect of twice weekly haemodialysis, PPIs, and yoga, respectively at the end of 3 months. All cases were interviewed to obtain information regarding GI symptoms, and endoscopy was performed at the beginning and at the end of 3 months. Result(s): In this prospective study, there were 66 males and 34 females. Nausea (93%), vomiting (57%), and anorexia (65%) were the most common symptoms; and erosive gastritis (21%) and hiatus hernia (15%) were the most common endoscopic findings in CKD patients. Effect of adequate haemodialysis caused reversal of both symptoms and endoscopic findings, whereas effect of PPIs and yoga had only symptomatic relief but no pathological change as the endoscopic findings remained unchanged due to continued presence of uraemic toxins. Conclusion(s): Patients of chronic kidney disease frequently develop different GI symptoms and GI lesions. There was reversal of upper GI symptoms and endoscopic abnormality following adequate haemodialysis therapy. Persistence of endoscopic abnormality suggests that the improvement was not complete due to continued presence of uraemic toxins in non-dialysed patients.Copyright © 2014 Indian Academy of Clinical Medicine.

Individual exposures were measured as urinary concentrations of three pyrethroid metabolites ((3-phenoxybenzoic acid (3PBA), cis- and trans- 3-(2,2-Dichlorovinyl)-1-methylcyclopropane-1,2-dicarboxylic acid (CDCCA and TDCCA)). Multiprobe fluorescence in situ hybridization for chromosomes X, Y, and 18 was used to determine XX, YY, XY, 1818, and total sex chromosome disomy in sperm nuclei. Poisson regression analysis was used to examine the association between aneuploidy rates and pyrethroid metabolites while adjusting for covariates.
RESULTS: Between 25-56% of the sample were above the limit of detection (LOD) for the pyrethroid metabolites. All sex chromosome disomies were increased by 7-30% when comparing men with CDCCA and TDCCA levels above the LOD to those below the LOD. For 3PBA, compared to those below the LOD, those above the LOD had YY18 disomy rates 1.28 times higher (95% CI: 1.15, 1.42) whereas a reduced rate was seen for XY18 and total disomy (IRR = 0.82; 95% CI: 0.77, 0.87; IRR = 0.93; 95% CI: 0.87-0.97), and no association was seen for XX18 and 1818.
CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that urinary concentrations of CDCCA and TDCCA above the LOD were associated with increased rates of aneuploidy. However the findings for 3BPA were not consistent. This is the first study to examine these relationships, and replication of our findings is needed before the association between pyrethroid metabolites and aneuploidy can be fully defined.",Excluded
1111,"Combined concomitant boost radiotherapy and chemotherapy in stage III-IV head and neck carcinomas: a comparison of toxicity and treatment results with those observed after radiotherapy alone BACKGROUND: Alteration of radiation therapy (RT) fractionation and the combination of chemotherapy (CT) with RT represent two predominant fields of current research in the treatment of head and neck carcinomas. To assess the potential integration of these two fields, a retrospective comparison of toxicity and treatment outcome was carried out in stage III-IV patients treated with a concomitant boost RT schedule with or without CT., PATIENTS AND METHODS: Fifty-two patients were treated by RT alone and 35 by RT and CT. In the RT group, there were significantly fewer T3-4 tumors (56% vs. 88%, P = 0.002) and higher proportion of planned neck dissections (35% vs. 14%, P = 0.047). The planned total dose was 69.9 Gy delivered over 5.5 weeks. In 10 cases CT was given before RT and in 25 concomitantly with RT, either alone or with neoadjuvant and/ or adjuvant CT. All patients but two had cisplatin-based (CDDP, 100 mg/m2) CT, associated in 28 patients with 5-fluorouracil (5-FU, 1000 mg/m2/24 h x 5). The median follow-up for the surviving patients was 21 and 31 months for the RT and RT-CT groups respectively., RESULTS: Grade 3-4 acute toxicity (RTOG) was observed in 73% and 36% of patients, and grade 3 dysphagia in 31% and 57% (P = 0.02) respectively in the RT and RT-CT groups. The rates of grade 3-4 late complications were similar in the two groups (5% vs. 12%). At three years, actuarial loco-regional control (LRC) was 57% and 66% (P = 0.66) and overall survival was 56% and 47% (P = 0.99) in the RT and RT-CT groups respectively., CONCLUSIONS: While acute toxicity was higher compared with RT alone, this accelerated RT schedule was feasible in association with 5-FU/CDDP, even administered concomitantly. Despite the significant proportion of more advanced disease in the RT-CT group, LRC was similar to that obtained by RT alone. Combinations of concomitant boost RT and chemotherapy merit further investigation in prospective trials.",Excluded
395,"Simulation of Tracer Dose Reduction in 18F-FDG PET/MRI: Effects on Oncologic Reading, Image Quality, and Artifacts The aim of our study was to evaluate the effect of stepwise-reduced doses on objective and subjective image parameters and on oncologic readings in whole-body 18F-FDG PET/MRI. Methods: We retrospectively simulated the stepwise reduction of 18F-FDG doses of 19 patients (mean age +/- SD, 50.9 +/- 11.7 y; mean body mass index +/- SD, 22.8 +/- 3.2 kg/m2) who received a whole-body PET/MRI examination from 3 to 0.5 MBq/kg of body weight (kgBW) in intervals of 0.25. Objective imaging parameters were assessed by measuring the SUV and coefficient of variation in different regions (aorta, liver, spleen, kidney, small bowel, lumbar vertebra, psoas muscle, urinary bladder) as well as the noise-equivalent counting rates in each bed position. Subjective image quality was evaluated with a masked reading of each simulated PET compared with the dose of 2 MBq/kgBW. Oncologic reading was performed first according to PERCIST in each dose and second by defining malignant lesions in doses of 2 MBq/kgBW and the maximum dose image (gold standard). The diagnostic confidence of each lesion was measured using a Likert scale. Results: With decreasing doses, regions in the mid abdomen showed a stronger decrease of SUVmean and noise-equivalent counting rates than regions in the upper abdomen (SUVmean, -45% and -15% on average in the small bowel and the liver, respectively). The coefficient of variation showed a nonlinear increase, pronounced below 1.5 MBq/kgBW. Subjective image quality was stable over a range between 1.25 and 2.75 MBq/kgBW compared with 2 MBq/kgBW. However, large photopenic areas in the mid abdomen were observed in 2 patients. In the PERCIST reading, target lesions were above the liver threshold with a stable SUVpeak in all cases down to 2 MBq/kgBW. Eighty-six of 90 lesions were identified correctly with a dose of 2 MBq/kgBW; Likert scores did not differ significantly. Conclusion: A reduction of doses in 18F-FDG PET/MRI might be possible down to 2 MBq/kgBW in oncologic whole-body examinations. The image quality in the mid abdomen seems to be more affected by lower doses than in the upper abdomen, and in single cases large photopenic areas can occur. Therefore, we do not recommend reducing doses below 3 MBq/kgBW in adults at this time. Copyright © 2017 by the Society of Nuclear Medicine and Molecular Imaging.",Excluded
736,"Synergic stimulation of the greater occipital nerve (GON) and sphenopalatine ganglion (SPG) for the control of cluster headaches (CH) Introduction: CH is a form of primary unilateral headache that features repeated attacks of excruciating severe pain. Frequently unresponsive to medical management, it has attracted the interest for its resolution by means of ablative surgical techniques and neuromodulation. We present two patients suff ering from CH refractory to conservative treatment, who were subjected to chronic synergic stimulation of the occipital nerve and SPG with a three year follow up. Material(s) and Method(s): Two patients suff ering from CH, a 48 y/o female, and a 23 y/o male, both refractory to medical treatment, underwent surgery on February and March, 2008, respectively. In both cases we proceeded to the simultaneous implantation of SPG and greater occipital nerve stimulators. They were followed up using the VAS, HDRS, HARS, and SF-36 questionnaire, previous to the procedure, 3, 6, 9 and 12 months after the procedure, and subsequently every 6 months. The stimulation schedule was as follows: four months of SPG stimulation, four months of GON stimulation, and simultaneous stimulation. Result(s): The first patient experienced and excellent initial pain relief, presenting a sudden loss of stimulation of the facial area 12 days after surgery, noting electrode displacement from the SPG in control X-ray (picture 1), which required its relocation, with the subsequent regaining of the initial benefit. Both patients obtained the greatest response (in terms of pain relief) during the simultaneous stimulation of SPG and GON, which was superior to that one obtained with the independent stimulation of each structure. The female patient obtained a complete control with total disappearance of the crisis. Surprisingly, 15 month after the intervention she did not required utilizing the stimulation, situation that remains unchanged to date. The male patient obtained a pain reduction of 86% during the first three months of synergic stimulation according to the VAS, but he remained at 66% pain reduction thereafter. Also, the number of crisis decreased in a significant manner. Discussion(s): Multiple percutaneous techniques have been proposed to control CH symptoms, including the utilization of radiofrequency on the Gasser ganglion, GON and SPG, among other structures (1). With the advent of neuromodulation, deep hypothalamic stimulation demonstrated a high efficacy in the treatment of this condition (2), even though with some risks inherent to the procedure, including death. Conclusion(s): Synergic stimulation of the greater occipital nerve and SPG has demonstrated greater effectiveness in the control of the frequency and magnitude of painful crisis of CH in relation to single stimulation of each one of these structures. We believe this is a useful therapeutic strategy before considering deep hypothalamic stimulation due to its greater frequency of complications.",Excluded
124,"Accuracy of 128-slice dual-source CT using high-pitch spiral mode for the assessment of coronary stents: First in vivo experience Objective: To investigate the accuracy of 128-slice dual-source CT using high-pitch spiral mode (HPS) for the assessment of coronary stents. Method(s): We conducted a prospective study on patients with previous stent implantation due to recurred suspicious symptoms of angina with positive findings at stress testing scheduled for coronary angiography (CA), while dual source computed tomography (DSCT) examinations were randomly done by one of the three different scan modes [HPS, sequential mode (SEQ), low-pitch spiral mode (LPS)] one week before CA examinations. The image quality, radiation dose and stent patency of DSCT were evaluated blinded to the results of CA. Result(s): 180 patients with total 256 stents were enrolled in this study. There was no significant difference on the image quality of DSCT by HPS (1.4 +/- 0.5), SEQ (1.5 +/- 0.5) and LPS (1.3 +/- 0.6) (P > 0.05). The noise of images reconstructed with B26f kernel in HPS is significantly increased than in SEQ/LPS (P < 0.05), while no significant difference with images reconstructed with B46f kernel (P > 0.05). Heart rate (HR) variability had a slight impact on the image quality for HPS (P < 0.05), not for LPS/SEQ (P > 0.05). In the assessment of stent restenosis compared with CA on per-stent basis, there was no significant difference on sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), and negative predictive value (NPV) of DSCT using HPS (100%, 97.1%, 83.3%, 100%), LPS (92.3%, 95.9%, 80%, 98.6%) and SEQ (93.3%, 97.3%, 87.5%, 98.6%) (P > 0.05). The effective dose of DSCT by HPS (1.0 +/- 0.5 mSv) is significant less than that by SEQ (3.0 +/- 1.4 mSv) or LPS (13.0 +/- 5.4 mSv) (P < 0.01). Conclusion(s): DSCT using HPS provides good diagnostic accuracy on coronary stent patency compared with CA, similar to that by SEQ/LPS, whereas with lower effective dose in patients with HR lower than 65 bpm. © 2012 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

797,"Optical Surface Scanning for Patient Positioning in Radiation Therapy: A Prospective Analysis of 1902 Fractions PURPOSE/OBJECTIVE: Reproducible patient positioning remains one of the major challenges in modern radiation therapy. Recently, optical surface scanners have been introduced into clinical practice in addition to well-established positioning systems, such as room laser and skin marks. The aim of this prospective study was to evaluate setup errors of the optical surface scanner Catalyst HD (C-RAD AB) in different anatomic regions., MATERIAL/METHODS: Between October 2016 and June 2017 a total of 1902 treatment sessions in 110 patients were evaluated. The workflow of this study included conventional setup procedures using laser-based positioning with skin marks and an additional registration of the 3-dimensional (3D) deviations detected by the Catalyst system. The deviations of the surface-based method were then compared to the corrections of cone beam computed tomography alignment which was considered as gold standard. A practical Catalyst setup error was calculated between the translational deviations of the surface scanner and the laser positioning. Two one-sided t tests for equivalence were used for statistical analysis., RESULTS: Data analysis revealed total deviations of 0.09 mm +/- 2.03 mm for the lateral axis, 0.07 mm +/- 3.21 mm for the longitudinal axis, and 0.44 mm +/- 3.08 mm vertical axis for the Catalyst system, compared to -0.06 +/- 3.54 mm lateral, 0.53 +/- 3.47 mm longitudinal, and 0.19 +/- 3.49 mm vertical for the laser positioning compared to cone beam computed tomography. The lowest positional deviations were found in the cranial region, and larger deviations occurred in the thoracic and abdominal sites. A statistical comparison using 2 one-sided t tests showed a general concordance of the 2 methods ( P <= 0.036), excluding the vertical direction of the abdominal region ( P = 0.198)., CONCLUSION: The optical surface scanner Catalyst HD is a reliable and feasible patient positioning system without any additional radiation exposure. From the head to the thoracic and abdominal region, a decrease in accuracy was observed within a comparable range for Catalyst and laser-assisted positioning.",Excluded
565,"Temporal evolution of administered activity in cardiac gated SPECT and patients' effective dose: analysis of an historical series PURPOSE: Myocardial perfusion imaging contributes >20 % of the average medical radiation exposure to the population in the USA. Imaging protocols able to achieve a radiation exposure <=9 mSv in 50 % of the studies by 2014 have been recommended. The aim of this study was to analyse the temporal evolution of administered activities in patients scheduled for dual-day (99m)Tc tracer gated single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) and to compare different dose administration protocols in terms of patients' effective dose., METHODS: Patients evaluated from 1 July 2002 to 31 January 2012 were allocated according to the protocol adopted: group 1: fixed activity according to diagnostic reference level: 740 MBq up to 80 kg (adapted for weight <60 kg); 900 MBq 80-100 kg, 1,110 MBq >100 kg, standard filtered back-projection (FBP) reconstruction; group 2: weight-adjusted activity: 8 MBq/kg up to 1,110 MBq, standard FBP reconstruction; and group 3: 4 MBq/kg, UltraSPECT wide beam reconstruction (WBR) reconstruction. A dual-head Anger camera (GE Helix) was used., RESULTS: A total of 9,060 patients were allocated to different groups: 4,751 in group 1, 2,844 in group 2 and 1,465 in group 3. The stress + rest administered activity was 1,617 +/- 180 in group 1, 1,136 +/- 260 in group 2 and 682 +/- 164 MBq in group 3 (all p < 0.001). Patients' effective dose was 13.7 +/- 3 in group 1, 9.5 +/- 2.8 in group 2 and 5.7 +/- 1.6 mSv in group 3 (all p < 0.001). The 50th percentile was 12.6 in group 1, 9.1 in group 2 and 5.3 mSv in group 3. The effective dose received by the dedicated cardiologists was 2.1, 1.5 and 1.0 muSv/exam in group 1, group 2 and group 3 periods, respectively (all p < 0.001)., CONCLUSION: A significant reduction over time in the administered activity for gated SPECT was achieved; accordingly, a significant reduction in patients' exposure was obtained. A simple weight-adjusted strategy with 8 MBq/kg immediately fulfils the recommendations to limit exposure. In selected group 3 patients, a stress-only strategy allows for studies with <3 mSv exposure. Thus, at least the adoption of a new reconstruction algorithm is strongly encouraged, and suggested tracer activities for cardiac gated SPECT are to be revised.",Excluded
74,"The Impact of Dose Rate on DNA Double-Strand Break Formation and Repair in Human Lymphocytes Exposed to Fast Neutron Irradiation The lack of information on how biological systems respond to low-dose and low dose-rate exposures makes it difficult to accurately assess the carcinogenic risks. This is of critical importance to space radiation, which remains a serious concern for long-term manned space exploration. In this study, the gamma-H2AX foci assay was used to follow DNA double-strand break (DSB) induction and repair following exposure to neutron irradiation, which is produced as secondary radiation in the space environment. Human lymphocytes were exposed to high dose-rate (HDR: 0.400 Gy/min) and low dose-rate (LDR: 0.015 Gy/min) p(66)/Be(40) neutrons. DNA DSB induction was investigated 30 min post exposure to neutron doses ranging from 0.125 to 2 Gy. Repair kinetics was studied at different time points after a 1 Gy neutron dose. Our results indicated that gamma-H2AX foci formation was 40% higher at HDR exposure compared to LDR exposure. The maximum gamma-H2AX foci levels decreased gradually to 1.65 +/- 0.64 foci/cell (LDR) and 1.29 +/- 0.45 (HDR) at 24 h postirradiation, remaining significantly higher than background levels. This illustrates a significant effect of dose rate on neutron-induced DNA damage. While no significant difference was observed in residual DNA damage after 24 h, the DSB repair half-life of LDR exposure was slower than that of HDR exposure. The results give a first indication that the dose rate should be taken into account for cancer risk estimations related to neutrons.",Included

1173,"A preliminary study of the use of ultrasound in defining nasal fractures: Criteria for a confident diagnosis Nasal fractures are usually diagnosed by clinical examination, with or without the support of imaging studies. While plain-film radiography lacks sensitivity and specificity for diagnosing nasal fractures, and computed tomography (CT) is not always practical or cost-effective, ultrasonography (US) may be useful in this regard. The criteria by which adult nasal fractures are reliably identified on US must be clear. We conducted a preliminary prospective, controlled, observational study to define the appearance of nasal fractures on US. We used US to image 12 patients with a clinical or radiologic (CT or x-ray) diagnosis of nasal fracture. All patients presented within 2 weeks of their injury. For comparison purposes, we also obtained US images from 12 control subjects who had no history of nasal trauma or surgery. We found that we could confidently diagnose nasal fractures on lateral-view US on the basis of a disruption of bone continuity and/or displacement of fracture segments. However, our findings were not as consistent with dorsal-view US, and we do not believe it is adequate for diagnosis. We conclude that lateral US can be used to detect nasal fractures in adults, but further studies are needed to assess its sensitivity, specificity, cost-effectiveness, and practicality.",Excluded

608,"Telomere length in human adults and high level natural background radiation BACKGROUND: Telomere length is considered as a biomarker of aging, stress, cancer. It has been associated with many chronic diseases such as hypertension and diabetes. Although, telomere shortening due to ionizing radiation has been reported in vitro, no in vivo data is available on natural background radiation and its effect on telomere length. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: The present investigation is an attempt to determine the telomere length among human adults residing in high level natural radiation areas (HLNRA) and the adjacent normal level radiation areas (NLNRA) of Kerala coast in Southwest India. Genomic DNA was isolated from the peripheral blood mononuclear cells of 310 individuals (HLNRA: N = 233 and NLNRA: N = 77). Telomere length was determined using real time q-PCR. Both telomere (T) and single copy gene (S) specific primers were used to calculate the relative T/S and expressed as the relative telomere length. The telomere length was determined to be 1.22+/-0.15, 1.12+/-0.15, 1.08+/-0.08, 1.12+/-0.11, respectively, among the four dose groups (</=1.50, 1.51-3.00, 3.01-5.00 and >5.00 mGy per year), which did not show any dose response. The results suggested that the high level natural chronic radiation did not have significant effect on telomere length among young adult population living in HLNRA, which is indicative of better repair of telomeric ends. No significant difference in telomere length was observed between male and female individuals. In the present investigation, although the determination of telomere length was studied among the adults with an age group between 18 to 40 years (mean maternal age: 26.10+/-4.49), a negative correlation was observed with respect to age. However, inter-individual variation was (0.81-1.68) was clearly observed. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: In this preliminary investigation, we conclude that elevated level of natural background radiation has no significant effect on telomere length among the adult population residing in HLNRAs of Kerala coast. To our knowledge, this is the first report from HLNRAs of the world where telomere length was determined on human adults. However, more samples from each background dose group and samples from older population need to be studied to derive firm conclusions.",Excluded
1184,"Comparing radiation exposure between ablative therapies for small renal masses PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the amount of radiation exposure patients with small renal masses undergoing percutaneous cyroablation (PCA) or percutaneous radiofrequency ablation (PRFA) received during treatment and follow up., MATERIALS AND METHODS: A retrospective review was conducted on all patients with small renal masses <4 cm treated with PCA or PRFA over a 7-year period in a single academic center. Preoperative, operative, and post-operative variables were collected and compared. Radiation exposure received during treatment and 1 year of follow up were also determined for each modality. Statistical analysis was conducted using SPSS V.17 (SPSS, Chicago, IL). The groups were compared using the Mann-Whitney U and Pearson Chi-Square tests. Statistical significance was considered at p<0.05., RESULTS: There was no significant difference in pretreatment parameters or oncologic outcomes. The average PCA treatment radiation exposure was 39.7 mSv (15.5-133.4 mSv) compared with 22.2 mSv (8.1-67.7 mSv) for PRFA (p=0.001). During the initial year after treatment, the estimated mean treatment and follow-up radiation exposure for PCA was 134.5 mSv, compared with 117 mSv for RFA when routine computerized tomography imaging was employed., CONCLUSION: To our knowledge, this is the first published study that quantifies radiation exposure in PCA and PRFA treatment for small renal masses. These relatively high radiation exposures should be included in the informed consent for these procedures. In addition, caution should be employed when applying these technologies in young patients who are most susceptible to long-term radiation damage.",Excluded
406,"Long-Term Clinical Outcome of First Recurrence Skull Base Meningiomas Skull base meningiomas (SBMs) are considered to be less aggressive and have a slower growth rate than non-SBMs. However, SBMs often develop local recurrences after surgical resection. Gross total removal is difficult because SBMs are deep-seated tumors and involve critical neurovascular structures. The treatment strategy for recurrent SBMs remains controversial. The present study aimed to evaluate the long-term clinical course and prognostic factors associated with shorter progression-free survival (PFS) of recurrent SBMs. This retrospective study included 85 recurrent SBMs from 65 patients who underwent surgery from January 2005 to September 2018. Overall survival (OS) and PFS were evaluated, and the associations among shorter PFS and age, sex, tumor size, lesions, World Health Organization (WHO) grading, removal rate, and time since prior surgery were analyzed. The median follow-up period for PFS was 68 months. The 2-, 5-, and 10-year PFS rates were 68.0%, 52.8%, and 22.7%, respectively. WHO grade II or III, multiple lesions, and tumor size were significantly associated with shorter PFS (p < 0.0001, p = 0.030, and p = 0.173, respectively). Although, radiotherapy did not improve PFS and OS for overall patients, PFS of the patients with subtotal and partial removal for WHO grade II SBMs was significantly improved by the radiotherapy. Multivariate analysis identified WHO grade II or III and multiple lesions as independent prognostic factors for shorter PFS (p < 0.0001 and p = 0.040, respectively). It is essential to estimate the risks associated with shorter PFS for patients with recurrent SBMs to aid in the development of appropriate postoperative strategies.",Excluded
229,"Outcome Prediction After Surgery and Chemoradiation of Squamous Cell Carcinoma in the Oral Cavity, Oropharynx, and Hypopharynx: Use of Baseline Perfusion CT Microcirculatory Parameters vs. Tumor Volume Purpose: To assess whether pretreatment perfusion computed tomography (PCT) may predict outcome in chemoradiated patients with oral cavity, oropharynx, and hypopharynx squamous cell carcinoma (SCCA) after surgical excision. Material(s) and Method(s): Twenty-one patients with SCCA were examined before treatment. The primary site was oral cavity in 6, oropharynx in 7, and hypopharynx in 8 patients; there were 11 T2, 6 T3, and 4 T4 tumors. PCT was performed at the level of largest tumor diameter based on standard neck CT. The data were processed to obtain blood flow (BF), blood volume (BV), mean transit time (MTT), and permeability surface area product (PS). Regions of interest were free-hand positioned on the lesions to obtain PCT measurements. Tumor volume was also calculated. Follow-up was performed with positron emission tomography (PET)/CT and endoscopy. Pearson correlation coefficient was used for comparison between the subgroups. A regression model was constructed to predict recurrence based on the following predictors: age, gender, tumor (T) and nodal (N) stage, tumor volume, and PCT parameters. Result(s): BFmean, BFmax, BVmean, BVmax, MTTmean, PSmean, and PSmax were significantly different between patients with and without tumor recurrence (0.0001, p < 0.04). T stage, tumor volume, N stage, BFmax, BVmax, MTTmean, and radiation dose (p < 0.001) were independent predictors for recurrence. Cox proportional hazards model for tumor recurrence revealed significantly increased risk with high tumor volume (p = 0.00001, relative risk [RR] 7.4), low PSmean (p = 0.0001, RR 14.3), and low BFmax (p = 0.002, RR 5.9).

715,"Radiation dose assessment in radioiodine therapy. Dose-response relationships in differentiated thyroid carcinoma using quantitative scanning and PET Dose-response charts have been constructed to determine the tumouricidal dose for differentiated thyroid carcinoma metastases and thus enable precise activities of radioiodine to be prescribed in order to maximise tumour kill and minimise morbidity. Tumour and normal residual thyroid absorbed doses from radioiodine-131 have been determined with increased precision using a dual-headed whole-body rectilinear scanner with special high-resolution low-sensitivity collimators. Improved accuracy in the estimation of functioning tumour mass has been achieved using positron emission tomography (PET) with a low-cost large area PET camera. Dose-response data have been obtained for 33 patients. Following near-total thyroidectomy and 3.0 GBq 131I, a mean absorbed dose of 410 Gy achieved complete ablation of thyroid remnants in 75% of patients. Patients who had persistent uptake in the thyroid region on subsequent radioiodine scanning had received a mean dose of only 83 Gy. Cumulative absorbed doses in excess of 100 Gy were found to eradicate cervical node metastases. Patients with bone metastases, who generally have a poor prognosis, were found to have received doses of the order of only 20 Gy to the tumour deposits. The dose-response data explain the spectrum of clinical responses to fixed activities of radioiodine. In future, they will enable precise prescription of radioiodine to achieve tumouricidal doses whilst avoiding the morbidity and expense of ineffective therapy.",Excluded

Collected data included device model, anatomic location, and treatment beam energies, treatment type, and estimated dose to the device. Patients were treated with either high-energy (16-MV) and/or low-energy (6 MV) photon beams with or without electron beams (6-16 MeV). The devices were interrogated with pre- and post-RT and/or weekly with either in-treatment or home interrogation, depending on the patient's dependence on the device and the estimated or measured delivered dose. Outcomes analyzed were inappropriate ICD therapies, device malfunctions, or device-related clinical events., RESULTS: The PMs were exposed to 84.4 +/- 99.7 cGy of radiation, and the ICDs were exposed to 92.1 +/- 72.6 cGy of radiation. Two patients with ICDs experienced a partial reset of the ICD with the loss of historic diagnostic data after receiving 123 and 4 cGy, respectively. No device malfunction or premature battery depletion was observed at 6-month follow-up from RT completion., CONCLUSIONS: CIED malfunction due to indirect RT exposure is uncommon. Regular in-treatment or home interrogation should be done to detect and treat these events and to ensure that diagnostic data are preserved. Copyright © 2012 Elsevier Inc.

Lowest radiation exposure (2.5 mSv) was seen with automated voltage preselection and the algorithm's selection was 100 kV (90.5% of patients) and 120 kV. Lowest image noise was seen in the highest dose group (3.1 mSv, 128-slice CT fixed tube voltage). A significant difference in cortical bone radiodensity was seen between 100 kV and 120 kV (P < 0.0001)., CONCLUSIONS: Preoperative pelvic CT for THA planning is possible with very low radiation dose and reliable quality. Automated voltage preselection further decreases the effective dose by 18.2%.",Excluded
446,"Induction of complete wound healing in recalcitrant ulcers by low-intensity laser irradiation depends on ulcer cause and size Chronic skin ulcers still represent a therapeutic challenge in dermatology. Among the various non-invasive treatment modalities used for the improvement of impaired wound healing, low-intensity laser irradiations are gaining an increasing body of interest. We used low-intensity laser irradiations delivered by a 30 mW helium-neon laser at an energy density of 30 J/cm2 three times weekly for the induction of wound healing in ulcers of diverse causes. Twenty patients with the same number of ulcers, which had previously been treated by conventional wound care for a median period of 34 weeks (range: 3-120 weeks) without any significant evidence of healing, were included in the study. Concerning the underlying disorders, patients were divided into four groups: diabetes, arterial insufficiency, radio damage and autoimmune vasculitis. In all ulcers, complete epithelization could be induced by laser therapy. No amputation or any other surgical intervention was necessary and no adverse effects of any kind were noted during low-intensity laser treatment. Regarding the different diagnoses, a statistically significant difference was noted (P = 0.008): ulcers due to radio damage healed significantly faster than those caused by diabetes (6 weeks [range: 3-10 weeks] vs. 16 weeks [range: 9-45 weeks], P = 0.005). Wound healing in autoimmune vasculitis (24 weeks [range: 20-35 weeks]) required longer than in radiodermitis, although the difference was not significant. In addition to the diagnosis, wound size was found to be an important factor influencing the duration of wound closure (P = 0.028), whereas duration of previous conventional treatment (P = 0.24) and depth (P = 0.14) showed no effect. Our results indicate that low-intensity laser irradiation could be a valuable non-invasive tool for the induction of wound healing in recalcitrant ulcers, and that healing time is correlated with the ulcer cause and size.",Excluded
552,"Estimating the risk of cancer and the hazardous index due to radiation from the phosphate mine in Russifa area Phosphate mines are considered prone to high radioactivity. The Russifa area contains one of the largest phosphate mines in Jordan. The hazardous index is high at 1.503 and 1.24, while the radium equivalent activity concentrations were 556.9 and 459.9 for phosphate pile and zoo, respectively. These values exceed the permissible levels in residential areas. The annual radiation doses at the site equals 36.4 and 30.1 mSv for the phosphate pile and zoo, respectively and these values pose a significant risk on the nearby population. Cancer risk is high in all body tissues, especially in the colon for both males and females. It is therefore imperative that these sites be rehabilitated and with a priority objective to reduce the annual dose rate to permissible levels and consequently the risk of cancer.",Included
1228,"Effect of a diagnostic dose of 185 MBq 131I on postsurgical thyroid remnants Stunning of thyroid remnants after diagnostic scanning with 131I may limit 131I therapy. The follow-up scans and serum thyroglobulin levels of such patients have been studied. Method(s): Threehundred seventy-eight patients who underwent thyroidectomy for differentiated thyroid carcinoma were studied. Diagnostic scans were obtained with 185 MBq 131I; 7.2 wk afterward, the patients received 489 ablative treatments with 4 GBq 131I. A total of 1575 scans were obtained (pre- and posttreatment scans and 615 follow-up scans). The evolution of serum thyroglobulin levels was determined. Result(s): In all patients, the thyroid-stimulating hormone level was more than 30 muIU/mL. Posttherapy scans showed less uptake than did diagnostic scans or even showed negative findings in 99 patients (21%). In these patients, the mean time between diagnostic scanning and therapy was 7.9 wk. In 61 of these 99 patients (61.6%), follow-up scans have shown negative findings, serum thyroglobulin was less than 3 ng/mL, and antithyroglobulin antibodies were not present. Twenty-three patients (23.2%) have not undergone follow-up scanning yet. In 8 patients (8.1%), follow-up scans showed negative findings but serum thyroglobulin was more than 3 ng/mL. In 7 patients (7.1%), follow-up scans showed less uptake than posttherapy scans, but the findings were not yet negative and thyroglobulin was less than 3 ng/mL. Concluslon: Our data suggest that a stunning effect does not exist for doses of 185 MBq 131I for diagnostic scans. However, a therapeutic effect may exist.",Excluded
1201,"Safety and efficacy of applying a low-dose radiation fluoroscopy protocol in device implantations Aims For cardiac implantable electronic device (CIED) implantations, visualization of lead placement is necessary and fluoroscopy remains by far the most commonly used technique. With simple changes in the X-ray system settings, total radiation dose can be reduced significantly. The purpose of this study was to assess the safety and efficacy of various CIED implantations performed after implementation of a new dose reduction protocol (DRP). Methods and results We conducted a retrospective chart review of 584 patients undergoing CIED implantation or revision in our hospital. Of these patients, 280 (48%) underwent the implantation prior to and 304 (52%) after the DRP introduction. The DRP included various changes for optimized image processing and exposure system settings to enable dose reduction, as well as a reduced frame rates (4 FPS for fluoroscopy and 7.5 FPS for cinematographic images). Of the 584 patients, 53 (9.1%) had a one-chamber pacemaker, 232 (39.7%) a two-chamber pacemaker, 133 (22.8%) a one-chamber ICD, 35 (6.0%) a two-chamber ICD, 82 (14.0%) a CRT (de novo) implantation, and 49 (8.3%) had an upgrade to a CRT device. DRP was associated with a 64% reduction of the dose-area product (1372+/-2659 vs. 3792+/-5025 cGcm2, P , 0.001), while fluoroscopy duration (13+/-15 vs. 13+/-15 min) and procedural duration (93+/-52 vs. 92+/-52 min.) did not significantly increase. Complication rates did not differ significantly between the two groups. Conclusion The DRP proved to effectively reduce radiation dose for all types of CIED implantations. Fluoroscopy time, total procedure time, and the number of complications did not increase after introducing the DRP.Copyright © 2017 The Author. European Society of Cardiology.

462,"Subclinical carotid atherosclerosis and early vascular aging from long-term low-dose ionizing radiation exposure: a genetic, telomere, and vascular ultrasound study in cardiac catheterization laboratory staff OBJECTIVES: This study sought to assess the association between long-term radiation exposure in the catheterization laboratory (cath lab) and early signs of subclinical atherosclerosis. BACKGROUND: There is growing evidence of an excess risk of cardiovascular disease at low-dose levels of ionizing radiation exposure. METHODS: Left and right carotid intima-media thickness (CIMT) was measured in 223 cath lab personnel (141 male; age, 45 +/- 8 years) and 222 unexposed subjects (113 male; age, 44+/-10 years). Leukocyte telomere length (LTL) was evaluated by quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction. The DNA repair gene XRCC3 Thr241Met polymorphism was also analyzed to explore the possible interaction with radiation exposure. The occupational radiological risk score (ORRS) was computed for each subject on the basis of the length of employment, individual caseload, and proximity to the radiation source. A complete lifetime effective dose (mSv) was recorded for 57 workers. RESULTS: Left, right, and averaged CIMTs were significantly increased in high-exposure workers compared with both control subjects and low-exposure workers (all p values<0.04). On the left side, but not on the right, there was a significant correlation between CIMT and ORRS (p=0.001) as well as lifetime dose (p=0.006). LTL was significantly reduced in exposed workers compared with control subjects (p=0.008). There was a significant correlation between LTL and both ORRS (p=0.002) and lifetime dose (p=0.03). The XRCC3 Met241 allele presented a significant interaction with high exposure for right side (pinteraction=0.002), left side (pinteraction<0.0001), and averaged (pinteraction<0.0001) CIMTs. CONCLUSIONS: Long-term radiation exposure in a cath lab may be associated with increased subclinical CIMT and telomere length shortening, suggesting evidence of accelerated vascular aging and early atherosclerosis.",Included
390,"Diet and melanoma in a case-control study Background: Malignant melanoma has been one of the most rapidly increasing cancers within the United States with few modifiable risk factors. This study investigates risk related to dietary factors, which are potentially modifiable. Method(s): Newly diagnosed patients with melanoma (n = 502) were recruited from pigment lesion clinics and controls (n = 565) were recruited from outpatient clinics. To investigate the relationship between melanoma and dietary factors in this case-control study, study subjects were requested to complete a food frequency questionnaire, which assessed diet over the previous year. Using logistic regression, odds ratios (ORs) for melanoma were computed for nutrient and alcohol intake. Result(s): Persons in high versus low quintiles of energy-adjusted vitamin D, alphacarotene, beta-carotene, cryptoxanthin, lutein, and lycopene had significantly reduced risk for melanoma (ORs <= 0.67), which remained after adjustment for presence of dysplastic nevi, education, and skin response to repeated sun exposure. Addition of micronutrients from supplements did not add an additional reduction in risk. High alcohol consumption was associated with an increased risk for melanoma, which remained after adjustment for confounders [OR (95% confidence interval) in highest versus lowest quintiles, 1.65 (1.09-2.49)]. Conclusion(s): Diets consisting of foods rich in vitamin D and carotenoids and low in alcohol may be associated with a reduction in risk for melanoma.

503,"Allogeneic stem cell transplantation after autologous SCT for primary mediastinal b cell lymphoma in the rituximab era: A retrospective study by the EBMT lymphoma working party Introduction: Evidence from the DLBCL setting suggests that allogeneic stem cell transplantation (alloSCT) is a reasonable salvage therapy for patients progressing despite undergoing autologous SCT (autoSCT and even as an alternative to autoSCT. Data regarding the effects of alloSCT in patients with primary mediastinal B cell lymphoma (PMBCL) are very limited. The objective of the current study was to investigate the outcome of alloSCT in patients with PMBCL who were previously treated with rituximab-based regimens and autoSCT. Materials (or patients) and Methods: All EBMT registered patients diagnosed with PMBCL who had undergone alloSCT between 2001 and 2011 as second transplant after a previous autoSCT were eligible. Patient characteristics, disease- and transplant-related data were collected from MED-A forms. Centers with potentially eligible patients were contacted to provide additional treatment and follow-up information, including a written histopathology report. Result(s): 12 patients, 5 females (42%) and 7 males with confirmed PMBCL, were included. The median age was 27 years, ranging from 21-to 61 years. Median time from diagnosis to alloSCT and from autoSCT to alloSCT were 14 (IQR 11-17 months and 7 months (IQR 4-9) respectively. Fifty-eight percent (N=7) had received at least 3 chemotherapeutic regimens prior allograft; 11 (92%) had been treated with rituximab-containing regimen and 67% (N=8) received mediastinal irradiation prior allosct. Evaluation of disease status at transplantation revealed that 42% (n=5) were in CR1/PR1 (alloSCT was performed here as part of a tandem transplant program), 17% (n=2) were in CR/PR>1 and 42% (n=5) were transplanted with refractory disease. 50% (n=6) were transplanted with residual mediastinal mass larger than 5 cm. Within a median follow up of 36 months, only 3 patients remained alive, whereas 9 patients died due to disease progression (n=3) or non-relapse mortality (n=6). Discussion(s): The current preliminary study does not suggest that alloSCT for PMBCL in the rituximab era can benefit a large proportion of patients. Larger studies are warranted to further define the role of allograft in this specific indication.",Excluded

The study was conducted in patients with newly diagnosed glioblastoma after surgical resection. Patients were treated with standard radiotherapy (6,000 cGy to the gross tumor volume), temozolomide (75 mg/m2 daily) together with daily oral NFV starting 7-10 days prior to chemoradiotherapy continuing for the duration of chemoradiation for 6 weeks. Temozolomide (150-200 mg/m2) was resumed 4 weeks after completion of chemoradiotherapy. Two dose levels of NFV were investigated: 625 mg twice daily (bid) and 1,250 mg bid in a cohort escalation design. A total of 21 patients were enrolled. At the maximum tolerated dose, 18 subjects were enrolled to further evaluate toxicity and for preliminary estimate of efficacy for further phase II study. No dose-limiting toxicity was noted at 625 mg bid. At 1,250 mg bid, 3 dose-limiting episodes of hepatotoxicity were noted and one dose-limiting episode of diarrhea. The MTD for this study was 1,250 mg bid. NFV (1,250 mg bid) concurrent with temozolomide and radiotherapy is tolerated in most patients with glioblastoma. At the 1,250 mg bid dose level, patients should be monitored for hepatotoxicity and GI side effects. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media New York.",Excluded
1155,"The influence of ventilatory disorders and clinical status on the early and late prognosis in patients with recent chronic heart failure exacerbation Purpose: The aims of the study were to assess: the prevalence of ventilatory disorders in patients with chronic heart failure (CHF) exacerbation, the correlation with clinical status and impact on prognosis. Method(s): There were 25 patients-22 (88%) men and 3 (12%) women (60+/-13 years) with decompensated CHF recruited for the study. All patients underwent following examinations: medical history, physical examination, laboratory tests (repeated on the lung function tests day), 12-leads electrocardiogram, X-ray, echocardiogram. The spirometry and body plethysmography were performed after patient's clinical haemodynamic stabilization. The following lung function tests parameters were taken into analysis: forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1), Tiffeneau ratio -FEV1 %VCmax (Maximal Vital Capacity), total lung capacity (TLC), vital capacity (VC), total airway resistance (Rtot). All examinations were repeated 3 months after the discharge. The median follow-up was 61 months. The Student's t-test or Mann-Whitney-U test, chi2 test and Pearson correlation were used for the initial statistical analysis. Result(s): The ejection fraction (EF) <=35% (21,1%+/-7,42) was confirmed in all patients on admission and 3 months after the discharge (23,3+/-8%, p=0,05). The elevated BNP level (2131,3+/-1096,8 pg/ml) was revealed in all patients on admission. Both BNP levels after stabilization (1192,4+/-1070,8 pg/ml) and 3 months after the discharge (745,7+/-635pg/ml) were lower than initial (p<0,0001). The spirometry revealed obstructive disorders in 20 patients (80%) at the discharge and 3 months later. The body plethysmography confirmed restrictive disorders in 2 patients (8%) at the discharge. We revealed the significant correlations between FEV1%VCmax and the highest BNP level (r=-0,45, p=0,027 ) and BNP level on lung function tests day (r=-0,44, p=0,03). We also found negative relationships between: EF and FEV1 (r=-0,41, p=0,04), EF and TLC (r=-0,59, p=0,007), EF and FEV1 measured 3 months after the discharge (r=-0,45, p=0,04).

There was a significant correlation between BNP level at the discharge (p<0,01), EF measured 3 months later (p=0,02) and death in 3 year follow-up period. Conclusion(s): Ventilatory disorders appeared in the majority of patients with CHF exacerbation and 3 months after this episode. There is a significant correlation between maximal BNP level, BNP after the stabilization and FEV1 % VCmax. There were no correlations between lung function tests parameters and mortality in early and late follow-up in this group of patients.",Excluded

Patients were followed by scintigraphy up to 4 h and by continued blood and urinary sampling until surgery 18-22 h after injection. Surgical tissue samples were analyzed for radioactivity uptake and NT receptor expression., RESULTS: No side effects were observed on injection of (99m)Tc-NT-XI. Blood biologic half-lives alpha and beta were 35 min (range, 17-62 min) and 230 min (range, 107-383 min), respectively. Repeated whole-body scintigraphy performed in 2 patients showed a single exponential decrease of whole-body activity with half-lives of 101 and 232 min. Tracer elimination was mainly renal, with 92% and 98% of activity counted in urine in the first 20 h. Kidney, liver, spleen, and bone marrow activity uptake was observed in all patients. Tumor was not visualized in the first 3 patients but could be localized by tomoscintigraphy in the pancreas head region of patient 4. In vitro tissue analysis showed high expression of NT receptor in the tumor of patient 4, correlated with the highest tumor radioactivity uptake and the highest tumor-to-fat radioactivity ratio. In vitro receptor expression was also positive in a second patient having a tumor characterized by very low cellularity; however, the remaining 2 tumors lacked NT receptor expression., CONCLUSION: Injection of (99m)Tc-NT-XI was well tolerated. The in vivo tumor uptake appeared specific as it was observed in the 1 patient with a pancreatic tumor that expressed high amounts of NT receptor. The results are compatible with preclinical animal results and in favor of further development of radiolabeled NT analogs for diagnosis or therapy of cancer.",Excluded
597,"Association between radiation dose and pathological complete response after preoperative radiochemotherapy in esophageal squamous cell cancer Aim: This study was undertaken to examine the impact of radiation dose on pathological complete response (pCR) rates following neoadjuvant radiochemotherapy (N-RCT) for squamous cell esophageal cancer (ESCC). Patients and Methods: From 1988 to 2011, 218 patients were treated with 30-30.6 Gy (1.8-2 Gy per fraction), 39.6-40 Gy (1.8-2 Gy per fraction) or 44-45 Gy (1.8-2 Gy per fraction) and concomitant cisplatin + 5-fluorouracil (5-FU), oxaliplatin + 5-FU or 5-FU alone. The most commonly used concomitant chemotherapy was continuous infusion of 5-FU-Alone with a dose of 300 mg/m2/day during the whole course of treatment (n=111). To eliminate the dispersing effect of potentially different efficacy levels of these drug regimens on pCR, we excluded patients with regimens other than 5-FU-Alone. Result(s): Histomorphological regression grade 1a (0% residual tumor), 1b (<10% residual tumor), 2 (10-50% residual tumor) and 3 (>50% residual tumor) was observed in 26 (23%), 24 (22%), 36 (32%) and 25 (23%) patients, respectively. pCR was observed in 9 out of 71 (13%) patients treated with 30 Gy-30.6 Gy, 13 of 34 (38%) patients treated with 39.6-40 Gy and 4 of 6 (67%) patients treated with 44-45 Gy (p=0.001). Median follow-up time from the start of N-RCT was 191 months (range=2-262 months). The estimated 5-year overall survival (OS) was 33% for the whole cohort. OS at 5 years was 58% for patients with pCR compared to 25% for patients with less favorable response to N-RCT (p=0.009), respectively. Conclusion(s): The dose of radiation correlates significantly with the likelihood of achieving a pCR in stage II/III squamous cell esophageal cancer patients. Prospective randomized trials are required to definitively evaluate the impact of application of higher radiation doses on efficacy and safety/tolerability in the context of N-RCT on the clinical outcomes.",Excluded
821,"Sex- and APOE isoform-dependent effects of radiation on cognitive function Clinical irradiation of the brain induces hippocampus-dependent cognitive impairments in some but not all individuals, suggesting the involvement of genetic risk factors. Deficiency of apolipoprotein E (APOE), which is important for the metabolism and redistribution of lipoproteins and cholesterol, increases behavioral impairments after irradiation, supporting a protective role for APOE against radiation-induced cognitive injury. Compared to APOE3, APOE4 increases while APOE2 decreases the risk of developing age-related cognitive decline and Alzheimer's disease, particularly in women. To determine the potential effects of APOE isoform and sex on radiation-induced cognitive impairments, we irradiated 2-month-old male and female APOE2, APOE3 and APOE4 mice and assessed their cognitive performance 3 months later. When hippocampus-dependent spatial learning and memory were assessed in the water maze, sham-irradiated female APOE2, APOE3 and APOE4 and irradiated female APOE2 mice showed spatial memory retention, but irradiated female APOE3 and APOE4 mice did not. Compared to sham-irradiated female APOE4 mice, irradiated female APOE4 mice also required more trials to reach criterion in the hippocampus-dependent passive avoidance test. Radiation had no effects on water maze or passive avoidance learning and memory of male APOE2, APOE3 or APOE4 mice, indicating that the effects of radiation on cognitive performance are dependent on sex- and APOE isoform.",Included
1158,"Can FRAX help portuguese men? The Portuguese model of the FRAX algorithm became available in June 2011. We reviewed the value of FRAX in a male population, to evaluate (1) if FRAX can identify patients with fracture risk (2) If it is relevant in patients without established risk factors. We reviewed all the DXA examinations in 2,5 years (1st July 2013 to 30th December 2015).A total of 6185 patients were examined with at least spine and femur analysis. During this period 395 examinations were done in men, of which 49 were excluded (7 which were incomplete and 42 patients who were on osteoporosis therapy). The study population consisted therefore of 346 examinations. Patients filled in a questionnaire. The technologist reviewed that data, inquired about fracture mechanisms and discussed risk factors with the patients. In many cases other relevant examinations (spine or hip x-ray, CT, MR) could be accessed on PACS. We had no laboratorial data. Previous fragility fractures were identified in 84 patients. For this study,FRAX values in patients with fractures were calculated ""without fracture"". We chose 10% as the threshold for the 10 year probability of major osteoporotic fracture (PMOF). The ratio of fractures increased slightly with age groups, except after 80y, and was very similar to osteoporosis diagnosed by DXA. Correlation with FRAX values was less reliable and FRAX identified much fewer cases. In patients without risk factors,FRAX didn't identify any patient with 10 year PMOF > 8%. The study population has several limitations: Its size is very small in comparison with studies with female patients, and it can suffer a selection bias. The poor performance of the FRAX threshold against DXAT-scores should be validated in a larger and prospective study. In the Portuguese male population even FRAX values computed with bone mineral density (BMD) data can sub evaluate fracture risk. FRAX values obtained without BMD should be interpreted with precaution. (Figure Presented).",Excluded
399,"Neuromuscular activation patterns during treadmill walking after space flight Astronauts adopt a variety of neuromuscular control strategies during space flight that are appropriate for locomoting in that unique environment, but are less than optimal upon return to Earth. We report here the first systematic investigation of potential adaptations in neuromuscular activity patterns associated with postflight locomotion. Astronaut-subjects were tasked with walking on a treadmill at 6.4 km/h while fixating a visual target 30 cm away from their eyes after space flights of 8-15 days. Surface electromyography was collected from selected lower limb muscles and normalized with regard to mean amplitude and temporal relation to heel strike. In general, high correlations (more than 0.80) were found between preflight and postflight activation waveforms for each muscle and each subject: however relative activation amplitude around heel strike and toe off was changed as a result of flight. The level of muscle cocontraction and activation variability, and the relationship between the phasic characteristics of the ankle musculature in preparation for toe off also were altered by space flight. Subjects also reported oscillopsia during treadmill walking after flight. These findings indicate that, after space flight, the sensory-motor system can generate neuromuscular-activation strategies that permit treadmill walking, but subtle changes in lower-limb neuromuscular activation are present that may contribute to increased lower limb kinematic variability and oscillopsia also present during postflight walking.",Excluded

The first 10 patients with a minimum follow-up of 3 months were analyzed. All tumors were oropharyngeal. There were four females and six males, with a mean age of 50 years (range 39-66). Stages were I-II in eight and III-IV in two. CTV1 was microscopic disease and N0 neck (prescribed dose : 50 Gy) and CTV2 was macroscopic disease and the volume at risk (prescribed dose: 66-70 Gy). PTV were CTV + 5 mm. Patient's immobilization consisted of a five-point head neck shoulder thermoplastic mask. Set-up verifications were done by semi-automatically matching portal images and digitized reconstructed radiographs. IMRT used dynamic multileaf collimation. Five patients (group A) received 50 Gy IMRT (two post-operative and three with a brachytherapy boost with a mean dose: 27.5 Gy), and five patients (group B) received 66-70 Gy IMRT (four post-operative). Acute and late normal tissue effects were graded according to the RTOG-EORTC radiation morbidity scoring criteria., RESULTS: With a median follow-up of 7.4 months (range 3-18.5), no patient died or had loco-regional relapse. The displacements were <4 mm in 98% cases. CTV1 and 2 received 95% of the prescribed dose in 100% of the volume. On average the mean dose to the contralateral parotid was 25.5 Gy for group A vs. 31 Gy for group B (P = 0.09). Mean doses <26 Gy were obtained in three of five patients in group A vs. zero of five patients in group B (P = 0.04). Acute skin toxicities were grade 1 in five patients, grade 2 in four and grade 3 in one. Acute mucositis cases were grade 1 in three patients, grade 2 in five and localized grade 3 in two. At 3 months, 50% of the patients had a grade 0-1 late xerostomia., CONCLUSION: The 26 Gy dose limit constraint to the contralateral parotid was easier to satisfy when IMRT was prescribed at a maximum dose of 50 Gy. Acute toxicity is low. The displacements in the mask indicate that it is possible to define the PTV as CTV + 4 mm. This reduction should decrease the mean dose to the parotids. At 3 months, a 50% rate of grade 0-1 late xerostomia encourages the hope of a very low rate at 2 years.",Excluded

Wide-field external beam radiation therapy, which we define as irradiation of cranial or caudal halves of the body either individually or sequentially, was undertaken as an experimental option to treat cats with either chemotherapy-refractory or naive hematopoietic neoplasia considered to have a poor prognosis. Fifteen cats with hematopoietic malignancies received wide-field external beam radiation therapy between 2003 and 2006. Cats received 8Gy delivered in 4Gy fractions with 60Co photons. Treatment-related toxicity was scored according to criteria established by the Veterinary Cooperative Oncology Group. Animals without preexisting abnormalities on hemograms exhibited no or mild (Grade 1 or 2) hematopoietic toxicity. Although most cats (14 of 15) had preexisting gastrointestinal (GI) signs, these signs were stable (29%) or improved (42%) following irradiation. Worsening GI signs following irradiation occurred transiently in two cats and in association with progressive disease in two others.

964,Characterization of feline whole-blood cultures and determination of the frequency of radiation-induced dicentrics in human and feline lymphocytes The Ham's F-10 and PHA culture system was applied to whole feline blood and cell-cycle characteristics such as DNA synthesis and mitotic indices were studied. The results are comparable to those obtained from human whole-blood cultures. The yields of dicentrics were also determined in lymphocytes from X-irradiated human and feline blood. The ratio between the experimental yields of dicentrics in human as compared to feline lymphocytes was 1:0.27.,Included
268,"Influence of C-reactive protein levels and age on the value of D-dimer in diagnosing pulmonary embolism Background: Recently, the number of performed CT-angiographies to diagnose pulmonary embolism (PE) rised markedly, while the incidence of PE hardly increased. This low yield of CT-angiography leads to more patients exposed to radiation and higher costs. Aim(s): The diagnostic value of age, C-reactive protein (CRP) and D-dimer in PE was investigated. Additionally an age-adjusted D-dimer cutoff level [age-adjusted cutoff = age/100 mg/L] was compared with the conventional cutoff level in diagnosing PE for patients >=50 yr. Method(s): This observational study (2004-2007) included all consecutive patients suspected for PE presenting on the emergency department with a performed CT-angiography after measuring CRP and D-dimer levels. Result(s): Of 4609 patients suspected for PE, 1164 patients underwent CT-angiography of whom 309 (26.5%) had PE. Correlation between CRP and D-dimer was 0.42 (P < 0.001). D-dimer and age correlated positively (rs = 0.33, P < 0.001), but only in patients >50 yr and independent of PE. Multivariate regression analysis showed significant contribution of age, D-dimer and age-adjusted D-dimer for diagnosing PE, but not for CRP. Using an age-adjusted D-dimer cutoff value increased specificity from 37% to 50%, whereas sensitivity declined from 96% to 90%. Applying this age-adjusted cutoff level in patients >=70 yr, specificity increased from 18% to 40%, while sensitivity decreased from 96% to 88%. Conclusion(s): In the prediction of PE, age and D-dimer levels are relevant, while CRP level is not. Using an age-adjusted D-dimer cutoff in older patients remarkably improves the specificity of D-dimer testing with a minor decline in sensitivity. This may increase the yield of CT-angiography in diagnosing PE. © 2013 John Wiley & Sons A/S.",Excluded
466,"The association between depressive and anxiety symptoms and bone mineral density in the general population: The HUNT Study Background: Psychiatric disorders may be risk factors for reduced bone mineral density (BMD). Longitudinal evidence is limited and this is yet to be examined among community-dwelling adults with anxiety. We aimed to investigate the cross-sectional and longitudinal relationships between anxiety and depressive symptoms and BMD. Method(s): This study examined data from the second Nord-Trondelag Health Study (1995-1997; 1194 men and 7842 women) and a follow-up conducted in 2001 (697 men and 2751 women). Symptomatology was ascertained using the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale and BMD was measured at the forearm using single-energy X-ray absorptiometry. Information on medication use and lifestyle was self-reported, and these, together with anthropometric measures were tested in multivariate analyses. Result(s): In men, adjusted BMD was 2.6% lower at the ultradistal forearm for those with depressive symptoms and 2.6% lower at the ultradistal and 2.0% lower at the distal forearm for those with anxiety symptoms. In women, adjusted BMD at the distal and ultradistal forearm was lower for heavier women with depressive symptoms but this relationship diminished with decreasing weight. Forearm BMD was similar for women with or without anxiety symptoms. Longitudinally, neither depressive nor anxiety symptoms were associated with bone loss over 4.6 years. Limitation(s): Findings cannot be generalised to other skeletal sites and a longer follow-up period may be necessary to detect differences in bone loss. Conclusion(s): These results indicate that depressive and anxiety symptoms are cross-sectionally associated with reduced BMD. These findings provide further evidence to support monitoring BMD in individuals diagnosed with psychiatric illness. © 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",Excluded
724,"Active cutaneous leishmaniasis associated with invasive squamous cell carcinoma coexistent in the same lesion: A case report Background: Cutaneous leishmaniasis is an infectious disease caused by a parasitic protozoan belonging to the genus Leishmania. Squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) is the second most common type of malignant neoplasm of the skin, usually caused by chronic solar exposure. Malignant degeneration of chronic healed or unhealed ulcers is an uncommon event called Marjolin's ulcer and mostly refers to SCC. Infectious diseases are one of the causes of chronic wounds and it has been described, although rare, cases of development of SCC on scar tissue of previous cutaneous leishmaniasis, but not in recent and active lesion. We present a case not yet reported in the literature of a cutaneous lesion of SCC and cutaneous leishmaniasis associated and diagnosed at the same time. Observation: A 72-year-old. man, black, came for his first consultation with a cervical lesion with seven months history, with progressive growth for the last 2 months, associated with local burning sensation. On dermatological examination, an ulcerated nodule with infiltrated and elevated borders with 4.5 x 5.0 cm was found in the posterior cervical region. The differential diagnosis were SCC, BCC, cutaneous metastasis and cutaneous leishmaniasis. A punch biopsy was performed and histopathological examination revealed a moderately differentiated invasive squamous cell carcinoma on the epidermis with an ulcerated area on the surface of the tumor, showing parasitic structures compatible with Leishmania sp and focal cell marking for leishmaniasis by immunohistochemistry. After the treatment of the leishmaniasis with liposomal amphotericin, the patient was referred for surgical treatment of the SCC. Key message: The rarity of the case presented is evident by the lack of publication available, and to our knowledge, none with such short evolution and associated diagnosis. Thus here we should question if the SCC has evolved in a leishmaniasis ulcer or whether leishmaniasis has developed in a pre-existing SCC.",Excluded
363,"XRCC3 Thr241Met gene polymorphism and risk of colorectal cancer in Kashmir: a case control study XRCC (X-ray cross-complementing group) genes contribute to important DNA repair mechanisms that play roles in the repair of single strand breaks (SSBs) induced by a variety of external and internal factors, including ionizing radiation, alkylating agents and reactive oxygen species. These repair genes have a pivotal role in maintaining genomic stability through different pathways of base excision repair (BER). The aim of this study was to investigate the XRCC3 Thr241Met gene polymorphism in colorectal cancer (CRC) in Kashmir. We investigated the genotype distribution of XRCC3 gene in 120 CRC cases in comparison with 150 healthy subjects and found a significant association between XRCC3 genotypes and CRC (p<=0.05). Both heterozygous genotype (Thr/Met) as well as homozygous variant genotype (Met/Met) were moderately associated with elevated risk of CRC [OR=2.53; OR=2.29 respectively]. Also, Thr/Met and Met/Met genotypes demonstrated a significant association with the risk of CRC (p=0.003). This study displayed a significantly elevated risk for CRC in individuals with XRCC3 Thr/Met and Met/Met Genotype of about 2.5 times that with the Thr/Thr wild genotype.",Excluded
655,"A single-nucleotide polymorphism in the methylene tetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) gene is associated with risk of radiation pneumonitis in lung cancer patients treated with thoracic radiation therapy BACKGROUND: This study examined the association between functional single-nucleotide polymorphisms in candidate genes from oxidative stress pathways and risk of radiation pneumonitis (RP) in patients treated with thoracic radiation therapy for locally advanced lung cancer., METHODS: A review was conducted of 136 patients treated with radiation therapy for lung cancer between 2001 and 2007, and who had prior genotyping of functional single-nucleotide polymorphisms in oxidative stress genes including superoxide dismutase 2 (SOD2; rs4880) and methylene tetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR; rs1801131, rs1801133). RP events were retrospectively scored using the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events, version 4.0. Cox proportional hazard regression was performed to identify clinical variables and genotypes associated with risk of RP of grades >=2 and >=3 on univariate and multivariate analysis, respectively. P values were corrected for multiple hypothesis esting., RESULTS: With a median follow-up of 21.4 months, the incidence of grade >=2 RP was 29% and grade >=3 RP was 14%. On multivariate analysis, after adjusting for clinical factors such as concurrent chemotherapy and consolidation docetaxel, and lung dosimetric parameters such as volume receiving greater than 20 Gy and mean lung dose, MTHFR genotype (rs1801131; AA versus AC/CC) was significantly associated with risk of grade >=2 RP (hazard ratio: 0.37; 95% confidence interval: 0.18-0.76; P = .006, corrected P = .018) and grade >=3 RP (hazard ratio: 0.21; 95% confidence interval: 0.06-0.70; P = .01; corrected P = .03). SOD2 genotype was not associated with RP., CONCLUSIONS: This study showed an association between MTHFR genotype and risk of clinically significant RP. Further study of MTHFR-related pathways may provide insight into the mechanisms behind RP. Copyright © 2011 American Cancer Society.",Excluded
367,"Safety considerations during transapical aortic valve implantation OBJECTIVES Transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) is a new method for the treatment of very high-risk patients with aortic valve stenosis. The radiation dose to which the patient and each member of the heart team are exposed during this new fluoroscopically guided intervention is unknown. METHODS Between April 2008 and August 2013, 1177 consecutive patients underwent transapical TAVI (TA-TAVI). In 22 consecutive patients undergoing TA-TAVI, the radiation doses to the cardiothoracic surgeon, cardiologist, anaesthesiologist (performing echocardiography examination), surgical assistant and nurse were measured. The radiation dose measurements were performed during TAVI using thermoluminescence and film dosimeters positioned on seven parts of the body: (i) chest above the lead apron, (ii) pelvic area below the apron, (iii) chest below the apron, (iv) thyroid gland above the apron, (v) near eyes, (vi) hands (using rings) and (vii) the feet. The results were compared with the values given in the international literature on recommended radiation dose limits for workers. RESULTS The mean radiation time was 6.1 min and the mean dose-area product for the patients was 8.661 muGy . m2. Analysis of the dosimeters and the calculation of the effective dose showed a per intervention dose of 0.03 mSv for the surgeon, 0.05 mSv for the assistant, 0.02 mSv for the cardiologist and the anaesthesiologist and 0.001 mSv for the nurse. The maximum ionizing radiation per intervention was 0.5 mSv at the right hand of the surgeon (holding the introducer sheet) and 0.7 mSv at the left hand of the surgical assistant. Additionally, the analysis of the body dose shows a maximum dose to the lower leg of the surgeon (0.3 mSv) and the genital area of the assistant (0.06 mSv). CONCLUSIONS During a TA-TAVI procedure, the patients receive a higher X-ray dose than during coronary angiography with intervention. After 100 TAVI procedures, the members of the heart team sustain a comparable dose of ionizing radiation to the annual dose received by a busy interventional cardiologist. Therefore, maximal safety and optimal X-ray protection for patients and the members of the team are crucial and should be redefined. © The Author 2014.

58,"Increased brain cortical activity during parabolic flights has no influence on a motor tracking task Previous studies showed that changing forces of gravity as they typically occur during parabolic flights might be responsible for adaptional processes of the CNS. However, until now it has not been differentiated between primary influences of weightlessness and secondary influences due to psycho-physiological factors (e.g., physical or mental strain). With the aim of detecting parabolic flight related changes in central cortical activity, a resting EEG was deduced in 16 subjects before, during and after parabolic flights. After subdividing EEG into alpha-, beta-,delta- and theta-wave bands, an increase in beta-power was noticeable inflight, whereas alpha(1)-power was increased postflight. No changes could be observed for the control group. To control possible effects of cortical activation, a manual tracking task with mirror inversion was performed during either the phase of weightlessness or during the normal gravity phase of a parabolic flight. No differences in performance nor in adaptation could be observed between both groups. A third group, performing under normal and stress-free conditions in a lab showed similar tracking values. We assume that the specific increase in brain activity is a sign of an increase in arousal inflight. This does support previous assumptions of non-specific stressors during parabolic flights and has to be considered as a relevant factor for experiments on central nerve adaptation. Although no influences of stress and/or weightlessness on motor performance and adaptation could be observed, we suggest that an inflight"" control group seems to be more adequate than a laboratory control group to investigate gravity-dependent changes in motor control.""",Excluded
895,"Manganese-52 positron emission tomography tracer characterization and initial results in phantoms and in vivo Purpose: Manganese(II) is employed as a contrast agent with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) for study of neuronal activation in rats and mice. However, at the concentrations required for MRI, Mn may induce pharmacological or toxic effects. Positron emission tomography (PET) imaging of 52MnCl2 at tracer doses has the potential to allow similar Mn studies as manganese-enhanced MRI while providing quantitative results and avoiding toxic effects. In this work, 52MnCl2 is produced and characterized as a PET tracer in phantoms and in rats. Method(s): 52MnCl2 was produced by proton irradiation of natural Cr foil and separated by column chromatography. Images were acquired on a Siemens Focus 120 small animal PET scanner. Phantom images were acquired to assess uniformity, resolution, cascade background correction, and count rate linearity. Images of rats were also acquired after systemic and intracerebroventricular (ICV) administration of 52MnCl2 to investigate Mn(II) distribution in vivo. Result(s): Irradiation yield was 74.6 +/- 8.5 kBqmuA min 52Mn at end of bombardment with initial specific activity of at least 3.5 MBqnmol. 52Mn PET images show similar uniformity and resolution to 18F. 18F based detector efficiency normalization is adequate for 52Mn imaging. Subtraction of a rescaled random events distribution from sinogram data is effective for cascade correction of 52Mn PET data. After systemic injection, 52Mn appears in structures throughout the body of rats, including bones, liver, intestines, and the pituitary gland, but does not appear detectably throughout the brain. After ICV injection, 52Mn remains in the brain and spinal cord. Conclusion(s): 52Mn is a promising tracer for small animal PET imaging, yielding image quality comparable to 18F. Potential applications include studies similar to Mn-enhanced neuronal MRI, and in other organ systems including bones, spinal cord, and the digestive tract. © 2013 American Association of Physicists in Medicine.",Excluded
163,"Evaluation of radiation-induced changes to parotid glands following conventional radiotherapy in patients with nasopharygneal carcinoma Objectives: Xerostomia is a common post-radiotherapy (post-RT) complication in nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) patients. This study evaluated the relation of post-RT parotid gland changes with the dose received. Method(s): Data from 18 NPC patients treated by radiotherapy between 1997 and 2001 were collected. Parotid gland volumes were measured and compared between their pre-RT and post-RT CT images; both sets of CT were conducted with the same scanning protocol. Doppler ultrasound was used to assess the haemodynamic condition of the glands after radiotherapy. Doppler ultrasound results were compared against 18 agematched normal participants. A questionnaire was used to evaluate the patients'comments of xerostomia condition. Radiotherapy treatment plans of the participants were retrieved from the Eclipse treatment planning system from which the radiation doses delivered to the parotid glands were estimated. The correlations of parotid gland doses and the post-RT changes were evaluated. Result(s): The post-RT parotid glands were significantly smaller (p<0.001) than the pre-RT ones. They also demonstrated lower vascular velocity, resistive and pulsatility indices (p<0.05) than normal participants. The degree of volume shrinkage and subjective severity of xerostomia demonstrated dose dependence, but such dependence was not definite in the haemodynamic changes. Conclusion(s): It was possible to predict the gland volume change and subjective severity of xerostomia based on the dose to the parotid glands for NPC patients. However, such prediction was not effective for the vascular changes. The damage to the gland was long lasting and had significant effects on the patients' quality of life. © 2011 The British Institute of Radiology.",Included
441,"Nomogram for predicting symptom severity during radiation therapy for head and neck cancer OBJECTIVES: Radiation therapy (RT), with or without chemotherapy, can cause significant acute toxicity among patients treated for head and neck cancer (HNC), but predicting, before treatment, who will experience a particular toxicity or symptom is difficult. We created and evaluated 2 multivariate models and generated a nomogram to predict symptom severity during RT based on a patient-reported outcome (PRO) instrument, the MD Anderson Symptom Inventory-Head and Neck Module (MDASI-HN)., STUDY DESIGN: This was a prospective, longitudinal, questionnaire-based study., SETTING: Tertiary cancer care center., SUBJECTS AND METHODS: Subjects were 264 patients with HNC (mostly oropharyngeal) who had completed the MDASI-HN before and during therapy. Pretreatment variables were correlated with MDASI-HN symptom scores during therapy with multivariate modeling and then were correlated with the composite MDASI-HN score during week 5 of therapy., RESULTS: A multivariate model incorporating pretreatment PROs better predicted MDASI-HN symptom scores during treatment than did a model based on clinical variables and physician-rated patient performance status alone (Akaike information criterion = 1442.5 vs 1459.9). In the most parsimonious model, pretreatment MDASI-HN symptom severity (P < .001), concurrent chemotherapy (P = .006), primary tumor site (P = .016), and receipt of definitive (rather than adjuvant) RT (P = .044) correlated with MDASI-HN symptom scores during week 5. That model was used to construct a nomogram., CONCLUSION: Our model demonstrates the value of incorporating baseline PROs, in addition to disease and treatment characteristics, to predict patient symptom burden during therapy. Although additional investigation and validation are required, PRO-inclusive prediction tools can be useful for improving symptom interventions and expectations for patients being treated for HNC.

1255,"Altered mechanical behavior of demineralized bone following therapeutic radiation Post-radiotherapy (RTx) bone fragility fractures are a late-onset complication occurring in bone within or underlying the radiation field. These fractures are difficult to predict, as patients do not present with local osteopenia. Using a murine hindlimb RTx model, we previously documented decreased mineralized bone strength and fracture toughness, but alterations in material properties of the organic bone matrix are largely unknown. In this study, 4 days of fractionated hindlimb irradiation (4 x 5 Gy) or Sham irradiation was administered in a mouse model (BALB/cJ, end points: 0, 4, 8, and 12 weeks, n = 15/group/end point). Following demineralization, the viscoelastic stress relaxation, and monotonic tensile mechanical properties of tibiae were determined. Irradiated tibiae demonstrated an immediate (day after last radiation fraction) and sustained (4, 8, 12 weeks) increase in stress relaxation compared to the Sham group, with a 4.4% decrease in equilibrium stress (p <.017). While tensile strength was not different between groups, irradiated tibiae had a lower elastic modulus (-5%, p =.027) and energy to failure (-12.2%, p =.012) with monotonic loading. Gel electrophoresis showed that therapeutic irradiation (4 x 5 Gy) does not result in collagen fragmentation, while irradiation at a common sterilization dose (25 kGy) extensively fragmented collagen. These results suggest that altered collagen mechanical behavior has a role in postirradiation bone fragility, but this can occur without detectable collagen fragmentation. Statement of Clinical Significance: Therapeutic irradiation alters bone organic matrix mechanics and which contribute to diminished fatigue strength, but this does not occur via collagen fragmentation.Copyright © 2020 Orthopaedic Research Society.

Here we report a retrospective study of the treatment and other factors associated with its outcomes. Material(s) and Method(s): The medical records of 100 patients diagnosed with ATC at Ito Hospital between 1993 and 2009 were reviewed and pertinent information was extracted and analyzed. Result(s): There were 80 women and 20 men, and their median age at diagnosis was 68 years (range, 41-90 years). Thirteen patients had a history of well-differentiated thyroid carcinoma. Six patients had a small ATC focus within a differentiated carcinoma. All cases were retrospectively staged according to the Union for International Cancer Control classification system, and the results were stage IVA in 11 cases, stage IVB in 31 cases, and stage IVC in 58 cases. Seventy patients underwent surgical treatment, and complete resection was performed in 24 of them. Seventy-eight patients received radiotherapy, and 58 of them received a total dose of >=40 Gy. Twenty-seven patients received chemotherapy. Only 15 patients received multimodal therapy (surgery, radiotherapy, and chemotherapy). The 1-year survival rates according to stage were as follows: stage IVA, 72.7%; stage IVB, 24.8%; and stage IVC, 8.2%. Multivariate analysis identified age >=70 years, white blood cell >=10,000 mm3, extrathyroidal invasion, and distant metastasis at the time of diagnosis as prognostic factors. Survival after complete resection was significantly better than after incomplete resection or no resection. The results also suggested that radiation doses of >=40 Gy were associated with significantly longer survival. Conclusion(s): Although the prognosis of most patients with ATC continues to be poor, surgery, radiotherapy, and a combination of both improved the survival of patients with ATC. © 2011, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.",Excluded
400,"Are the SNPs of NKX2-1 associated with papillary thyroid carcinoma in the Han population of Northern China? Papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC) is one of the most common tumors of the thyroid gland. The common risk factors of PTC include ionizing radiation, positive family history, and thyroid nodular disease. PTC was identified in Europeans by conducting a genome-wide association study, and a strong association signal with PTC was observed in rs944289 and NKX2-1 (located at the 14q13.3 locus), which was probably the genetic risk factor of PTC. This study aimed to examine the association of this gene with PTC in Chinese. A total of 354 patients with PTC and 360 healthy control subjects from the Han population of Northern China were recruited in the study. These individuals were genotyped to determine rs12589672, rs12894724, rs2076751, and rs944289. The association of rs944289 with PTC was obtained (C vs. T, P = 0.027, OR = 1.264, 95% CI = 1.026 - 1.557; and C/C - C/T vs. T/T, P = 0.034, OR = 1.474, 95% CI = 1.028 - 2.112). Conducting a subgroup analysis, we found a marginal difference in the allele frequency distribution of rs944289 (adjusted P = 0.062) between the patients with PTC and multi-nodular goiter and the control subjects. We also observed an interaction (P = 0.029; OR = 2.578, 95% CI = 1.104 - 6.023) between rs944289 and diabetes in patients with PTC.

223,"Personalized space radiation dosimetry using monte carlo simulations of CT-based geometries exposed to solar particle event radiation Purpose/Objective(s): A serious concern for space exploration to the Moon or Mars is astronaut exposure to ionizing radiation in a solar particle event (SPE). SPE are unpredictable, variable in intensity and energy spectrum, and are primarily protons with kinetic energies below 100 MeV. The dose from an SPE is highly inhomogeneous and sensitive to physical parameters such as energy spectrum, shielding, and anisotropy. The biological effects of low dose-rate proton radiation are not fully understood. Interpretation of data from ground-based experiments in animal models is complicated by inhomogeneous distribution of dose to sensitive organs. Planning and preparation for space exploration vitally relies on accurate prediction of the health risk associated with exposure to SPE. Materials/Methods: We have developed a Monte Carlo radiation transport tool that incorporates CT scans into dose calculations of radiobiological experiments in animal models and simulated exposure of humans to SPE radiation. This allows accurate predictions of SPE dose and is used to develop dose-toxicity data for pre-clinical animal experiments and for predicting astronaut organ doses from exposure to SPE radiation. Result(s): We validated this tool using phantom measurements and determine organ doses for Yucatan mini-pigs exposed to simulated SPE radiation designed to match 3 historical events with relatively low (October, 1989), intermediate (September, 1989) and high (August, 1972) levels of >100 MeV protons to model toxicity vs dose in critical internal organs. These studies show a paradoxical increase in clinical/systemic toxicity for SPE with lower internal dose that appears to correlate with suppression of leukocyte counts. For astronaut SPE exposures, we applied this tool to 4 different human model (2 male, 2 female) astronauts exposed to the 3 SPE in geometries designed to simulate exposure within a space suit or capsule. The results indicate that not only does an astronaut's dose to specific organs (e.g., skin, eyes, and lungs) differ substantially for different SPE, different astronauts receive significantly different organ doses even with the same SPE exposure. Conclusion(s): These studies clearly show the value of our dosimetry system for two critically interrelated uses: determining the dose to organ systems for SPE exposed astronauts and helping ensure that earth based experiments reproduce appropriate dose distributions in order to maximize the applicability of these findings. Our results suggest that a personalized approach for astronaut dosimetry may be valuable in determining the course of clinical action in the event of an SPE exposure.",Included
744,"Insufficient Vitamin D Response to Solar Radiation in German Patients with Type 2 Diabetes or Gestational Diabetes Vitamin D deficiency is highly prevalent in all forms of diabetes mellitus. Recently, we reported how ultraviolet B (UVB) radiation affected vitamin D [25(OH)D3] concentrations in patients with type 1 diabetes. Our aim was to analyze whether patients with non-autoimmune diabetes, such as type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) also show the same vitamin D profile in relation to environmental factors including ambient temperature as an indirect parameter for outdoor activities. We analyzed 25(OH)D3 concentrations of T2DM (n=349) and GDM patients (n=327) at the University Hospital Frankfurt from 2005 to 2007. Additionally, daily UVB and monthly outside air temperature measurements for Frankfurt/Germany were obtained. We detected a positive correlation between UVB irradiation and 25(OH)D3 concentrations of T2DM and GDM patients (rho=0.50 and rho=0.63, p=0.003 and p<0.0001, respectively). UVB irradiation was in summer (April-October) higher than in winter (November-March) (5.6 kJ/m vs. 0.5 kJ/m, p<0.0001). However, the prevalence of vitamin D deficiency in summer remained high with 76% in T2DM and 59% in GDM. In a stepwise regression analysis for the 25(OH)D3 concentration, significant predictors were outdoor temperature (estimate=0.02, p<0.0001), UVB radiation (estimate=-0.0015, p=0.02), year (2006 vs. 2005 estimate=-0.06, p>0.05, 2007 vs. 2005: estimate=-0.13, p<0.0001) and diabetes type (estimate=0.06, p=0.03). In conclusion, the strong correlation between UVB radiation and 25(OH)D3 concentrations in T2DM and GDM patients determines the seasonal variation. Additional determinants for the 25(OH)D3 concentrations were outdoor temperature, year, and diabetes type. Despite the effects of solar radiation both patients groups remain largely vitamin D deficient during summers.Copyright © Georg Thieme Verlag KG Stuttgart, New York.",Excluded
638,"Dose-response study of intracoronary beta-radiation with 32P in balloon- and stent-injured coronary arteries in swine Purpose: A dose-response study was performed in swine to investigate the vascular effects of 32P over a broad range of doses in order to define the therapeutic window of intracoronary radiotherapy (ICR) with 32P. Methods and Materials: A total of 131 porcine arteries were subjected to balloon injury or stenting followed by 0-36 Gy of ICR from a centered 32P source wire to 1 mm beyond lumen surface or a sham ICR procedure. Animals were euthanized at 4 weeks, and vessels were harvested for histomorphometry. Result(s): In the balloon-injured arteries, doses of 7 and 9 Gy did not impact restenosis. At doses of 14-36 Gy, neointima was markedly reduced, with mild dilatation at the highest dose, 36 Gy. In the stent-injured arteries, the lowest dose of 9 Gy failed to reduce neointimal growth, while 14-26 Gy showed the most favorable response. Conclusion(s): ICR with 32P features a broad therapeutic window. Doses of 14-26 Gy to 1 mm beyond lumen surface provided an optimal combination of efficacy and safety. Doses of 7 and 9 Gy were generally ineffective, suggesting a minimum threshold for ICR with 32P to effectively inhibit restenosis. Copyright © 2002 Elsevier Science Inc.",Included
165,"Abscopal effect of boron neutron capture therapy (BNCT): proof of principle in an experimental model of colon cancer The aim of the present study was to evaluate, for the first time, the abscopal effect of boron neutron capture therapy (BNCT). Twenty-six BDIX rats were inoculated subcutaneously with 1 x 106 DHD/K12/TRb syngeneic colon cancer cells in the right hind flank. Three weeks post-inoculation, the right leg of 12 rats bearing the tumor nodule was treated with BPA-BNCT (BPA-Boronophenylalanine) at the RA-3 nuclear reactor located in Buenos Aires, Argentina, at an absorbed dose of 7.5 Gy to skin as the dose-limiting tissue. The remaining group of 14 tumor-bearing rats were left untreated and used as control. Two weeks post-BNCT, 1 x 106 DHD/K12/TRb cells were injected subcutaneously in the contralateral left hind flank of each of the 26 BDIX rats. Tumor volume in both legs was measured weekly for 7 weeks to determine response to BNCT in the right leg and to assess a potential influence of BNCT in the right leg on tumor development in the left leg. Within the BNCT group, a statistically significant reduction was observed in contralateral left tumor volume in animals whose right leg tumor responded to BNCT (post-treatment/pre-treatment tumor volume <1) versus animals who failed to respond (post/pre >=1), i.e., 13 +/- 15 vs 271 +/- 128 mm3. In addition, a statistically significant reduction in contralateral left leg tumor volume was observed in BNCT-responsive animals (post/pre <1) vs untreated animals, i.e., 13 +/- 15 vs 254 +/- 251 mm3. The present study performed in a simple animal model provides proof of principle that the positive response of a tumor to BNCT is capable of inducing an abscopal effect.",Excluded

At the time of launch, animals were 2-months old. MDS reached the ISS on board of Shuttle Discovery Flight 17A/STS-128 on August 28(th), 2009. MDS returned to Earth on November 27(th), 2009 with Shuttle Atlantis Flight ULF3/STS-129 after 91 days, performing the longest permanence of mice in space. Unfortunately, during the MDS mission, one PTN-Tg and two Wt mice died due to health status or payload-related reasons. The remaining mice showed a normal behavior throughout the experiment and appeared in excellent health conditions at landing. During the experiment, the mice health conditions and their water and food consumption were daily checked. Upon landing mice were sacrificed, blood parameters measured and tissues dissected for subsequent analysis. To obtain as much information as possible on microgravity-induced tissue modifications, we organized a Tissue Sharing Program: 20 research groups from 6 countries participated. In order to distinguish between possible effects of the MDS housing conditions and effects due to the near-zero gravity environment, a ground replica of the flight experiment was performed at the University of Genova. Control tissues were collected also from mice maintained on Earth in standard vivarium cages.",Excluded
226,"In vitro activation of the in vivo colony-forming units of the mouse yolk sac Experiments were performed to investigate the presence of colony-forming units (CFU) in the mouse embryonic yolk sac during the developmental period in which the yolk sac is the sole hemopoietic organ. Injection of yolk sac cell suspensions from normal embryos into syngeneic, lethally irradiated adult recipients evoked a very low number of spleen colonies. However, prior cultivation of yolk sacs in vitro caused a dramatic increase in the spleen colony-forming capacity--as high as 84-fold--following 48 hours in culture. The yolk sac origin of the spleen colonies was confirmed by: (a) Chromosomal marker analysis; (b) dose-response analysis; (c) demonstrating that the above colonies were not of endogenous origin induced by the mere injection of grafted cells. We conclude that the yolk sac contains many precursors of colony-forming cells which though undetectable by immediate grafting apparently become activated in culture by an as yet unknown induction process.",Excluded
828,"Gamma-H2AX-based dose estimation for whole and partial body radiation exposure Most human exposures to ionising radiation are partial body exposures. However, to date only limited tools are available for rapid and accurate estimation of the dose distribution and the extent of the body spared from the exposure. These parameters are of great importance for emergency triage and clinical management of exposed individuals. Here, measurements of gamma-H2AX immunofluorescence by microscopy and flow cytometry were compared as rapid biodosimetric tools for whole and partial body exposures. Ex vivo uniformly X-irradiated blood lymphocytes from one donor were used to generate a universal biexponential calibration function for gamma-H2AX foci/intensity yields per unit dose for time points up to 96 hours post exposure. Foci--but not intensity--levels remained significantly above background for 96 hours for doses of 0.5 Gy or more. Foci-based dose estimates for ex vivo X-irradiated blood samples from 13 volunteers were in excellent agreement with the actual dose delivered to the targeted samples. Flow cytometric dose estimates for X-irradiated blood samples from 8 volunteers were in excellent agreement with the actual dose delivered at 1 hour post exposure but less so at 24 hours post exposure. In partial body exposures, simulated by mixing ex vivo irradiated and unirradiated lymphocytes, foci/intensity distributions were significantly over-dispersed compared to uniformly irradiated lymphocytes. For both methods and in all cases the estimated fraction of irradiated lymphocytes and dose to that fraction, calculated using the zero contaminated Poisson test and gamma-H2AX calibration function, were in good agreement with the actual mixing ratios and doses delivered to the samples. In conclusion, gamma-H2AX analysis of irradiated lymphocytes enables rapid and accurate assessment of whole body doses while dispersion analysis of foci or intensity distributions helps determine partial body doses and the irradiated fraction size in cases of partial body exposures.",Excluded
236,"Radiation dose and image quality of prospective triggering with dual-source cardiac computed tomography Prospectively triggered (PT) cardiac computed tomography (CT), whereby radiation is administered only at a predefined phase of the cardiac cycle, has been shown to substantially decrease radiation dose. The aim of our study was to assess the use of this technique in a clinical population using dual-source cardiac CT. Of 312 consecutive patients referred for a dual-source cardiac computed tomographic examination, PT was used in 42 patients for whom, based on physician judgment, it was decided to minimize radiation, whereas retrospective gating was used for 188 patients (coronary artery bypass grafting and pulmonary vein studies were excluded). Kilovolt and milliampere per second were chosen for each patient based on assessment of body habitus and effective radiation dose was calculated. Analysis of nonevaluable vessels was based on clinical readings. For each study, image quality (IQ) was rated on a subjective IQ score and contrast-to-noise and signal-to-noise ratios were calculated. Of the 42 PT examinations (mean age 44.3 years, body mass index 27.8 kg/m(2), 62% men), 28 were referred for coronary evaluation, 11 for aortic disease with/without coronaries, and 3 for other reasons (i.e., suspected mass and congenital disease). Average heart rate was 64.5 beats/min. Average radiation dose of all 42 PT scans was 3.2 +/- 1.6 vs 13.4 +/- 7.8 mSv for the 188 non-PT scans. There was no significant difference in IQ score and contrast-to-noise and signal-to-noise ratios between the 2 groups. Furthermore, the incidence of limited right coronary artery evaluation and of limitations related to right coronary artery motion did not differ between PT and non-PT scans. In conclusion, in selected patients, prospective triggering with dual-source cardiac CT is feasible and results in a dramatic decrease of radiation dose without compromising IQ. Future advances in cardiac CT may further improve this technique, thus allowing for wider use.",Excluded
865,"Computed tomography evaluation of the femoral and tibial attachments of the posterior cruciate ligament in vitro PURPOSE: The optimal technique for reconstruction of the posterior cruciate ligament (PCL) is controversial. Regardless of surgical technique and graft choice, anatomic graft placement is essential for successful outcome. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the size and location of the insertions of the PCL using a computed tomography (CT) protocol., METHODS: The insertions in ten knees were marked in vitro with plastic markers. The CT examination was performed with the knee in extension. On the femur, the position of the center of the insertion site was evaluated relative to Blumensaat's line and the anterior articular surface. On the tibia, the location of the center of the insertion site was described relative to the borders of the tibial plateau and the retrospinal surface., RESULTS: The surface area of the femoral insertion measured 232 mm(-2) and was centered 8.9 mm from the roof of the intercondylar notch and 18.7 mm from the anterior articular cartilage surface. The surface area of the tibial insertion was 155 mm(2) and was centered 9.1 mm from the posterior border of the tibia on the retrospinal surface, 1.6 mm inferior to the plane of the tibial articular surface. This point was on average 49% of the way across the plateau relative to the medial edge of the plateau and 87% of the way across the plateau relative to the anterior edge., CONCLUSIONS: Computed tomography can provide detailed localization of the PCL attachment sites on the femur and tibia.

46,"Individual radiosensitivity and correlation with tumoral regression Purpose/Objective(s): On the one hand, higher individual radiosensitivity increases the risk for side effects of radiotherapy, on the other hand it could also lead to improved tumor response after neoadjuvant chemoradiation. Our point of interest was the correlation of individual radiosensitivity (gH2AX as a reliable factor of radiosensitivity) and regression of the rectal cancer. Materials/Methods: We investigated a total of 22 patients (19 male, 3 female, all in stage T3 N0/N + M0) with locally advanced rectal adenocarcinoma. All patients received neoadjuvant chemoradiation (RCT) followed by resection. Before treatment, 2ml of blood was collected, lymphocytes were isolated and irradiated with 2 Gy. After 24 hours, lymphocytes were stained with gH2AX antibodies. We compared our results with untreated lymphocytes of the same patient. At least 500 lymphocytes (and the included gammaH2AX -foci) were microscopically analyzed per patient. Subsequently, we statistically evaluated the correlation of the number of gammaH2AX foci (gammaH2AX as a sign for unrepaired DNA DSB), and tumor regression (RG) by Dworak et al. (RG 0 to 4; RG 0: no regression, RG 4: complete regression). Result(s): Five of 22 (23%) had a complete (RG 4), and 11 (50%) patients an almost complete tumoral regression (RG 3); However, 6 patients showed only a minor regression (RG1-2). In the untreated lymphocytes an average of 0.36 (+/- 0.21) foci was counted; after irradiation with 2 Gy and a 24 hour delay 2.25 Foci were still present. Tumoral regression (RG 3 + 4 vs. RG 0-2) correlated positively (p = 0.05) with the number of gammaH2AX-foci. However, regression did not correlate with other parameters such as age, weight, tumor size, dose and volume. Conclusion(s): In patients with adenocarcinoma of the rectum there is an obvious positive correlation of remaining gH2AX foci in peripheral lymphocytes and histopathological regression of primary tumor. These findings could be an indication that patients of rectal cancer with increased radiosensitivity benefit of better response to neoadjuvant RCT.",Excluded
1211,"Ischaemic heart disease incidence and mortality in an extended cohort of Mayak workers first employed in 1948-1982 Objective: Incidence and mortality from ischaemic heart disease (IHD) was studied in an extended cohort of 22,377 workers first employed at the Mayak Production Association during 1948-82 and followed up to the end of 2008. Method(s): Relative risks and excess relative risks per unit dose (ERR/Gy) were calculated based on the maximum likelihood using Epicure software (Hirosoft International Corporation, Seattle, WA). Dose estimates used in analyses were provided by an updated ""Mayak Worker Dosimetry System-2008"". Result(s): A significant increasing linear trend in IHD incidence with total dose from external g-rays was observed after having adjusted for non-radiation factors and dose from internal radiation {ERR/Gy50.10 [95% confidence interval (CI): 0.04 to 0.17]}. The pure quadratic model provided a better fit of the data than did the linear one. No significant association of IHD mortality with total dose from external g-rays after having adjusted for nonradiation factors and dose from internal alpha radiation was observed in the study cohort [ERR/Gy50.06 (95% CI: ,0 to 0.15)]. A significant increasing linear trend was observed in IHD mortality with total absorbed dose from internal alpha radiation to the liver after having adjusted for non-radiation factors and dose from external g-rays in both the whole cohort [ERR/Gy50.21 (95% CI: 0.01 to 0.58)] and the subcohort of workers exposed at alpha dose ,1.00Gy [ERR/Gy51.08 (95% CI: 0.34 to 2.15)]. No association of IHD incidence with total dose from internal alpha radiation to the liver was found in the whole cohort after having adjusted for non-radiation factors and external gamma dose [ERR/Gy50.02 (95% CI: not available to 0.10)]. Statistically significant dose effect was revealed in the subcohort of workers exposed to internal alpha radiation at dose to the liver ,1.00Gy [ERR/Gy50.44 (95% CI: 0.09 to 0.85)]. Conclusion(s): This study provides strong evidence of IHD incidence and mortality association with external g-ray exposure and some evidence of IHDincidence andmortality association with internal alpha-radiation exposure. Advances in knowledge: It is the first time the validity of internal radiation dose estimates has been shown to affect the risk of IHD incidence.Copyright © The Authors Publised by the British Institute of Radiology.",Included
377,"MRI-based cartilage thickness loss and joint space narrowing in an OAI core progression sample, and their relationship with age, sex, and BMI Purpose: The aim of this study was 1) To determine the most sensitive measurement location in fixed flexion radiographs (JSW) and MRI (cartilage thickness; ThC), over 2 years, in a core sample of the OAI progression cohort; 2) To evaluate age, sex, and BMI as independent risk factors of structural progression at these locations. Method(s): One knee in each of 541 (224 men) OAI participants enrolled in the progression cohort was studied (all had frequent knee pain; 249 had KL GraDe 2; 292 had KL GraDe 3). Change in medial femorotibial JSW was measured automatically at 7 locations (fixed distances, FD) from PA fixed flexion radiographs, and change in ThC was measured in 16 femorotibial subregions after manually segmenting sagittal DESS images. The standardized response means (SRM) were used to determine the most sensitive measurement locations. Results were compared between men and women, and between the highest vs. lowest tertiles of age and BMI using t-tests, and general linear models with adjustment for the other variables. Beta coefficients (with 95% CI) and standardized beta (Z-scores) are presented. Result(s): In this OAI core sample, the FD 0.225 JSW location was the most sensitive X-ray measure (SRM = 0.40), and the central medial femoro-tibial compartment subregion (cMFTC.ThC) the most sensitive MRI measure for structural progression over two years (SRM = 0.48). Age tertiles studied were 66-79 yrs, vs. 45-56 yrs, and BMI tertiles 31.8-47.7 kg/m2 vs.18.2-27.7. Age, sex, and BMI explained only 2.6% of the variation in structural progression (R2 of adjusted model) in X-ray and 3.9% in MRI. With X-ray, BMI (beta = -0.198mm, 95% CI -0.333, -0.064, standard beta = -0.308) had a significant relationship with progression (Fig. 1), but neither age (adjusted p = 0.587) nor sex (p = 0.099) did. With MRI, high BMI (beta = -0.092mm, 95% CI -0.161, -0.023, standard beta = -0.278), high age (beta = -0.090mm, 95% CI -0.159, -0.021, standard beta = -0.270) and male sex (b= -0.099mm, 95% CI -0.156, -0.042, standard beta = -0.299) were all identified as significant risk factors for structural progression (Fig. 1). Conclusion(s): Measurement locations in the central aspect of the medial femorotibial compartment were most sensitive to structural progression for both imaging methodologies, with MRI providing slightly greater sensitivity to change than fixed flexion radiographs over 2 years. Age, sex, and BMI explained <4% of the variation in structural progression with both methodologies. All were significantly associated with progression as measured with MRI (where men surprisingly showed greater progression than women) while only BMI was associated with progression as measured by X-ray. Our data suggest that MRI may be more sensitive for identifying progression of medial compartment knee OA than plain radiographs. (Figure presented).",Excluded
563,"Use of electrocardiogram to position right atrial catheters during surgery OBJECTIVE: This study evaluated the accuracy of placing right atrial catheters using an electrocardiographic (ECG) technique., SUMMARY BACKGROUND DATA: Placement of right atrial catheters for vascular access is a common operative procedure. Accurate placement is essential for proper function. Previous placement techniques have used fluoroscopy, which is both time consuming and hazardous., METHODS: The accuracy of placement of 1236 right atrial catheters using an ECG technique was compared to placement of 586 catheters using fluoroscopy between March 1991 and November 1995. In the ECG technique, the catheter was flushed with sodium bicarbonate. A sterile left-leg ECG lead was attached to the catheter with the other ECG leads applied normally. On advancing the catheter through the superior vena cava, the P-wave amplitude (lead II) increased in negative deflection until greater than the QRS complex. Passing the sinoatrial node, the P-wave developed an initial positive then negative deflection. The catheter was positioned so the P-wave was biphasic, representing a position midway between the sinoatrial and atrioventricular nodes. For the fluoroscopic technique, catheters were positioned under direct observation just within the atrium estimated from cardiac contour. Use of contrast was optional if atrial anatomy was unclear., RESULTS: Postoperative portable chest x-rays showed the ECG method to position the catheter tip within the right atrium just as accurately (average, 1.9 +/- 1.3 cm) as with the use of fluoroscopy (average, 1.1 +/- 1.6 cm). The ECG method eliminated an average of 20 seconds of radiation exposure, an average of 3.0 minutes operating room time (p < 0.04), avoided all risks of contrast dye, and saved $279.10 per case., CONCLUSIONS: The ECG method is a satisfactory alternative to that of fluoroscopy for placement of long-term central venous catheters into the right atrium.",Excluded
1160,"Deficiency in PER proteins has no effect on the rate of spontaneous and radiation-induced carcinogenesis There is a growing body of evidence that components of the circadian clock are involved in modulation of numerous signaling pathways, and that clock deregulation due to environmental or genetic factors contributes to the development of various pathologies, including cancer. Previous work performed in tissue culture and in in vivo mouse models defined mammalian PERIOD proteins as tumor suppressors, although some experimental inconsistencies (the use of mice on mixed genetic background, lack of sexual discrimination) did not allow a definitive conclusion. To address this issue in a systematic way, we performed a detailed analysis comparing the incidence of tumor development after low-dose ionizing radiation in male and female wild-type, Per1-/-, and Per2-/- mice. We showed that in contrast to previous reports deficiency in either Per1 or Per2 genes by itself does not make mice more tumor-prone; moreover, some of the long-term effects of ionizing radiation in Per2-deficient mice are reminiscent more of accelerated aging rather than tumor-prone phenotype. Our histopathological analysis also revealed significant sexual dimorphism both in the rate of radiation-induced tumorigenesis and in the spectrum of tumors developed, which underscores the importance of using sex-matched experimental groups for in vivo studies. Based on our results, we suggest that the role of PER proteins as bone fide tumor suppressors needs to be reevaluated. © 2013 Landes Bioscience.",Included

51,"Effects of different gamma exposure regimes on reproduction in the earthworm Eisenia fetida (Oligochaeta) Ecological risk assessment of ionising radiation requires knowledge about the responses of individuals and populations to chronic exposures, including situations when exposure levels change over time. The present study investigated processes such as recovery and the adaptive response with respect to reproduction endpoints in the earthworm Eisenia fetida exposed to (60)Co gamma-radiation. Furthermore, a crossed experiment was performed to investigate the influence of F0 parental and F1 embryonic irradiation history on the response of irradiated or non-irradiated F1 offspring. Recovery: The sterility induced by sub-chronic exposure at 17 m Gy/h (accumulated dose: 25 Gy) was temporary, and 8 weeks after irradiation the worms had regained their reproductive capacity (number of viable offspring produced per adult per week). Adaptive response: Adult worms were continuously exposed at a low priming dose rate of 0.14 mGy/h for 12 weeks (accumulated dose: 0.24 Gy), followed by 14 weeks exposure at a challenge dose rate of 11 mGy/h. The results suggest a lack of adaptive response, since there were no significant differences in the effects on reproduction capacity between the primed and the unprimed groups after challenge doses ranging from 7.6 to 27 Gy. Crossed experiment: The effects of exposure at 11 mGy/h for 21 weeks on growth, sexual maturation and reproduction of offspring, derived either from parent worms and cocoons both exposed at 11 mGy/h, or from non-irradiated parents and cocoons (total accumulated dose 44 and 38 Gy, respectively) were compared. There were no significant differences between the two exposed offspring groups for any of the endpoints. The reproduction capacity was very low for both groups compared to the controls, but the reproduction seemed to be maintained at the reduced level, which could indicate acclimatisation or stabilisation. Finally, parental and embryonic exposures at 11 mGy/h did not affect reproduction in the F1 offspring as adults. Copyright © 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",Excluded
432,"DNA alterations detected in the progeny of paternally irradiated Japanese medaka fish (Oryzias latipes) A nonmammalian test system for germ-cell mutagenesis has been developed by using the Japanese medaka fish. We describe a system for detecting DNA alterations in F1 progeny descended from the gamma-irradiated male medaka that uses an arbitrarily primed polymerase chain reaction and fingerprinting. A combination of these two methods has some advantages for screening changes in genomic DNA of individual progeny because this detection system can (i) screen for mutational events before embryos with dominant lethal mutations are eliminated during development and (ii) detect DNA changes in the progeny of irradiated males without functional selection and bias, such as resistance to chemicals. DNA alterations are detected as changes in patterns (i.e., band loss and/or band gain) of DNA fingerprints of progeny descended from males whose spermatozoa or spermatids were gamma-irradiated (4.75 or 9.50 Gy). We determined the frequency of gamma-irradiation-induced band loss in arbitrarily primed polymerase chain reaction fingerprints of DNA from severely malformed embryos with dominant lethal mutations and hatched viable embryos. The frequency of band loss in both dominant lethal embryos and hatched viable embryos increased with increasing gamma-ray dose, although more so in the former. We detected a new band in the fingerprints as a heritable DNA alteration but not a viability- or phenotype-affecting DNA alteration in two viable mutants recovered after gamma-irradiation experiments. A cloned amplified fragment of the new band contained a repeated sequence of p(ATGT)n.",Excluded
859,"The effect of vertical and horizontal symmetry on memory for tactile patterns in late blind individuals Visual stimuli that exhibit vertical symmetry are easier to remember than stimuli symmetric along other axes, an advantage that extends to the haptic modality as well. Critically, the vertical symmetry memory advantage has not been found in early blind individuals, despite their overall superior memory, as compared with sighted individuals, and the presence of an overall advantage for identifying symmetric over asymmetric patterns. The absence of the vertical axis memory advantage in the early blind may depend on their total lack of visual experience or on the effect of prolonged visual deprivation. To disentangle this issue, in this study, we measured the ability of late blind individuals to remember tactile spatial patterns that were either vertically or horizontally symmetric or asymmetric. Late blind participants showed better memory performance for symmetric patterns. An additional advantage for the vertical axis of symmetry over the horizontal one was reported, but only for patterns presented in the frontal plane. In the horizontal plane, no difference was observed between vertical and horizontal symmetric patterns, due to the latter being recalled particularly well. These results are discussed in terms of the influence of the spatial reference frame adopted during exploration. Overall, our data suggest that prior visual experience is sufficient to drive the vertical symmetry memory advantage, at least when an external reference frame based on geocentric cues (i.e., gravity) is adopted.",Excluded

Materials and methods One hundred patients were prospectively randomized to two types of contrast medium and underwent prospective electrocardiogram-triggering cCTA (Definition Flash, Siemens Healthcare; collimation: 128 mm x 0.6 mm; tube current: 300 mA s). Fifty patients received Iopromide 370 were scanned using the conventional tube setting (100 kVp or 120 kVp if BMI >= 25 kg/m2) and reconstructed with filtered back projection (FBP). Fifty patients received Iodixanol 270 were scanned using the low-tube-voltage (80 kVp or 100 kVp if BMI >= 25 kg/m 2) technique and reconstructed with IR. CT attenuation was measured in coronary artery and other anatomical regions. Noise, image quality and radiation dose were compared.

873,"Experiences of xerostomia after radiotherapy in patients with head and neck cancer: A qualitative study AIMS AND OBJECTIVES: To describe the experiences of radiation-induced xerostomia in patients with head and neck cancer., BACKGROUND: Xerostomia is the most commonly occurring complication during and following radiotherapy. It can persist for several months or years and can have a significant impact on patients' quality of life., DESIGN: This was a qualitative descriptive study., METHODS: Semi-structured interviews were conducted with a sample of 20 participants. Inductive content analysis was used to analyse the qualitative data., RESULTS: Analysis of the manifest content identified five categories: communication problems, physical problems, psychosocial problems, treatment problems and relief strategies. The latent content was formulated into a theme: due to lack of information from professionals, the patients had to find their own solutions for their problems., CONCLUSIONS: Xerostomia is not only a biophysical symptom but also has a profound effect on the emotional, intellectual and sociocultural dimensions of life. The majority of patients continued to suffer from xerostomia and its associated symptoms after radiotherapy, in part, because of a lack of professional support, including the inability of nurses to provide oral health care., RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE: Nurses need to be knowledgeable about the effects of radiotherapy on oral mucosa and about appropriate interventions. The healthcare system requires a symptom management platform for radiation-induced complications, to help patients, their families and healthcare professionals obtain information about self-care, treatments and relief strategies.

1213,"Chronic bronchitis in the cohort of Mayak workers first employed 1948-1958 Incidence of chronic bronchitis has been studied in a cohort of 12,210 workers first employed at one of the main plants of the Mayak nuclear facility during 1948-1958 and followed up to 31 December 2005. Information on external gamma doses is available for virtually all of these workers; in contrast, plutonium body burden was measured only for 30% of workers. During the follow-up period in the study cohort 1,175 incident cases of chronic bronchitis were verified. The analyses of nonradiation factors revealed that the underlying risk of chronic bronchitis incidence increased with increasing attained age and was higher among smokers compared with never-smokers as would be expected. The most interesting finding in relationship to nonradiation factors was a sharp increase in the baseline chronic bronchitis risk before 1960. The cause of this is not clear but a number of factors may play a role. Based on the follow-up data after 1960, the analysis showed a statistically significant linear dose response relationship with cumulative external gamma-ray dose (ERR/Gy = 0.14, 95% CI 0.01, 0.32). Based on the same subset but with an additional restriction to members with cumulative internal lung dose below 1 Gy, a statistically significant linear dose response relationship with internal alpha-radiation lung dose from incorporated plutonium was found (ERR/Gy = 2.70, 95% CI 1.20, 4.87). In both cases, adjustment was made for nonradiation factors, including smoking and either internal or external dose as appropriate. At present there are no similar incidence studies with which to compare results. However, the most recent data from the atomic bomb survivor cohort (the Life Span Study) showed statistically significant excess mortality risk for respiratory diseases of 22% per Gy and this value is within the confidence bounds of the point estimate of the risk from this study in relation to external dose.",Excluded
842,"Joint echinococcosis: A report of three new cases Background Joint hydatidosis is defined as the development within the joint of multiple cysts that are the larval form of the tapeworm echinococcus granulosus. Bone and joint cysts account for less than 0.5% of all hydatid cysts in human. We report three cases of joint hydatidosis. Results Case 1: A 63-year-old woman, who was operated 4 times for lung and liver cyst hydatidosis, was complaining of right inflammatory lumbosciatica S1. Examination revealed pain when pressing the sacral region. X-rays revealed a heterogeneous lesion of the right sacrum. Computed tomography showed an eleven-mm diameter cyst in the right buttock joint with an anterior development into the pelvic cavity. Muscles were not involved. Surgical enucleation of the cysts was performed. Histopathologic examination showed germinative membranes of the hydatid cyst confirming the diagnosis. Case 2: A 35 year old man with history of right hip pain for the past 5 years and a progressive loss of motion range. Examination found a painful and restricted right hip movement in all directions. X-rays and computed tomography scan showed bone destruction of the hip, multiple cysts and ectopic calcifications around the joint. Serological test for hydatid disease was positive (1/280), confirming the diagnosis of hip hydatidosis. Case 3: A 39 year old women with history of liver hydatid cyst treated with surgery 14 years ago, was complaining of right shoulder pain for the past year. Examination revealed diffuse swelling of right shoulder with painful and restricted movement in all directions. X-rays showed multiple cysts of the shoulder with pathological fracture of the humerus diaphysis. MRI and hydatid serological test confirmed the diagnosis. Conclusions Hydatid cysts still occur in Tunisia despite prevention programs. The liver and the lung are the most frequent targets. The joint involvement is uncommon but severe. Joint contamination is usually local from bone lesion and rarely by blood or lymph vessels.

To determine the tolerance doses of cutaneous and mucosal tissues of normal birds in order to provide more effective radiation treatment for tumors that have been shown to be radiation responsive in other species, ingluvial mucosa and the skin over the ingluvies of 9 ring-necked parakeets (Psittacula krameri) were irradiated in 4-Gy fractions to a total dose of either 48, 60, or 72 Gy using an isocentric cobalt-60 teletherapy unit. Minimal radiation-induced epidermal changes were present in the high-dose group histologically. Neither dose-related acute nor chronic radiation effects could be detected in any group grossly in cutaneous or mucosal tissue over a 9-month period. Radiation doses of 72 Gy in 4-Gy fractions were well tolerated in the small number of ring-necked parakeets in this initial tolerance dose study.",Included
103,"A randomized trial of sodium alginate prevention of esophagitis in LA-NSCLC receiving chemoradiotherapy: OLCSG1401 Background: Radiation esophagitis is a critical adverse event that needs to be appropriately managed while administering thoracic irradiation. This trial aimed to investigate whether sodium alginate has preventative effects on esophagitis in patients with non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) receiving concurrent chemoradiotherapy (CRT). Method(s): Patients with untreated stage III NSCLC who were eligible for concurrent CRT were randomly assigned at a 1:1:1 ratio to receive one of the following treatments: initial or late use of oral sodium alginate (arms A and B) or water as control (arm C). The primary endpoint was the proportion of patients developing G3 or worse esophagitis. Result(s): Overall, 94 patients were randomly assigned between February 2014 and September 2018. The study was prematurely terminated because of slow accrual. The proportions of patients with G3 or worse esophagitis were 12.5%, 9.8%, and 19.4% in arms A, B, and C, respectively. Patients receiving sodium alginate had fewer onsets of G3 esophagitis; however, differences compared with arm C were not significant (A vs. C: p = 0.46; B vs. C: p = 0.28). The rates of grade 3 or worse non-hematologic toxicities besides esophagitis were 29%, 26%, and 43% in arms A, B, and C, respectively. Interestingly, compared with arm C, a low rate of febrile neutropenia was observed in arm A (3.1% vs. 19.4%: p = 0.04). Conclusion(s): Sodium alginate did not show significant preventative effects on radiation-induced esophagitis in patients with NSCLC. The frequency of CRT-induced febrile neutropenia was lower in the early use sodium alginate arm.

1030,"Cancer incidence among Australian nuclear industry workers To assess whether workers at Lucas Heights Science and Technology Centre (LHSTC) had different levels of cancer incidence from the New South Wales (NSW) population in Australia. A retrospective cohort study was undertaken at LHSTC. Data on 7,076 workers employed between 1957-98 were abstracted from personnel, dosimetry, and medical files. An inception cohort was defined which included 4,523 workers in employment between 1972-96 to examine cancer incidence. Cancer registrations in the inception cohort were identified to 1996 through electronic linkage of records with the NSW and the Australian national registers of cancer incidence. All-cancer incidence in workers at LHSTC was 15% below the NSW rates [SIR=0.85; 95% CI=(0.75, 0.95)]. Of 37 specific cancers and groups of cancers examined, statistically significant excesses relative to NSW rates were observed only for pleural cancer incidence [SIR=17.71; 95%=(7.96, 39.43)], and for incidence of cancer of the small intestine [SIR=4.34; 95% CI=(1.40, 13.46)]. This study gives little evidence of an increased risk of cancers associated with radiation exposure in a cohort of nuclear workers in Australia. The observed increase in the risk of cancer of the pleura was probably due to unmeasured exposures, given the lack of an established association with radiation exposure, and the strong link to asbestos exposure. Findings for cancers of the small intestine were based on small numbers and were likely to be due to chance.",Included

Patients were randomized to 80-kVp imaging (n = 103) or 100-kVp imaging (n = 105). Three blinded readers graded interpretability and image quality. Study signal, noise, and contrast were also compared., RESULTS: Imaging with 80 kVp instead of 100 kVp was associated with 47% lower median radiation dose (median dose-length product, 62.0 mGy . cm [interquartile range, 54.0-123.3 mGy . cm] vs 117.0 mGy . cm [110.0-225.9 mGy . cm], respectively; 0.9 mSv [0.8-1.7 mSv] vs 1.6 mSv [1.4-3.2 mSv]; p < 0.001 for each) with no significant difference in interpretability (99% vs 99%; p = 0.99) or image quality (median score, 4.0 [interquartile range, 3.6-4.0] vs 4.0 [interquartile range, 3.8-4.0]; p = 0.20). Studies obtained using 80 kVp were associated with 27% increased signal (mean +/- SD, 756 +/- 157 vs 594 +/- 105 HU; p < 0.001), 25% higher contrast (890 +/- 156 vs 709 +/- 108 HU; p < 0.001), and 50% greater noise (55 +/- 15 vs 37 +/- 12 HU; p < 0.001) with resultant 15% and 16% decreases in signal-to-noise (mean +/- SD, 15 +/- 5 vs 17 +/- 5; p < 0.001) and contrast-to-noise (mean +/- SD, 17 +/- 6 vs 21 +/- 5; p < 0.001) ratios, respectively., CONCLUSION: Coronary CTA using 80 kVp instead of 100 kVp was associated with a nearly 50% reduction in radiation dose with no significant difference in interpretability and noninferior image quality despite lower signal-to-noise and contrast-to-noise ratios. The use of 80-kVp tube voltage should be considered in dose-reduction strategies for coronary CTA of individuals with a normal BMI.",Excluded
784,"Evaluation of salivary gland function after treatment of head-and-neck tumors with intensity-modulated radiotherapy by quantitative pertechnetate scintigraphy Purpose: To evaluate salivary gland function after inversely planned stereotactic intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) for tumors of the head-and-neck region using quantitative pertechnetate scintigraphy. Methods and Materials: Since January 2000, 18 patients undergoing IMRT for cancer of the head and neck underwent pre- and posttherapeutic scintigraphy to examine salivary gland function. The mean dose to the primary planning target volume was 61.5 Gy (range 50.4-73.2), and the median follow-up was 23 months. In all cases, the parotid glands were directly adjacent to the planning target volume. The treatment planning goal was for at least one parotid gland to receive a mean dose of <26 Gy. Two quantitative parameters (change in maximal uptake and change in the relative excretion rate before and after IMRT) characterizing the change in salivary gland function after radiotherapy were determined. These parameters were compared with respect to the dose thresholds of 26 and 30 Gy for the mean dose. In addition, dose-response curves were calculated. Result(s): Using IMRT, it was possible in 16 patients to reduce the dose for at least one parotid gland to <=26 Gy. In 7 patients, protection of both parotid glands was possible. No recurrent disease adjacent to the protected parotid glands was observed. Using the Radiation Therapy Oncology Group/European Organization for the Research and Treatment of Cancer scoring system, only 3 patients had Grade 2 xerostomia. No greater toxicity was seen for the salivary glands. The change in the relative excretion rate was significantly greater, if the parotid glands received a mean dose of >=26 Gy or >=30 Gy. For the change in maximal uptake, a statistically significant difference was seen only for the parotid glands and a dose threshold of 30 Gy. For the end point of a reduction in the parotid excretion rate of <50% and 75%, the dose-response curves yielded a dose at 50% complication probability of 34.8 +/- 3.6 and 40.8 +/- 5.3 Gy, respectively. Conclusion(s): Using IMRT, it is possible to protect the parotid glands and reduce the incidence and severity of xerostomia in patients. Doses <26-30 Gy significantly preserve salivary gland function. The results support the hypothesis that application of IMRT does not lead to increased local failure rates. © 2004 Elsevier Inc.",Excluded
1133,"RAPID lung cancer diagnostic and care pathway from referral to treatment Introduction: This was a pilot prospective study which compared RAPID lung cancer pathway with existing arrangements for diagnosis, staging and treatment of lung cancer. Aim(s): Early diagnosis and treatment of lung cancer improves survival. We compared RAPID lung cancer pathway with existing arrangements to reduce the hurdles in early diagnosis and provision of treatment to potential lung cancer patients. Early investigations identify non-cancer patients quicker. Method(s): On existing pathway chest X-ray (CXR) is requested by general practitioner (GP) as a first line investigation on lung cancer suspicion. If CXR is reported as abnormal then radiology requests a CT thorax with urgent request for GP to refer to hospital after discussion with the patient. On RAPID pathway, abnormal X-ray report is highlighted to lung cancer coordinator who Organizes GP referral, speaks to patient directly and organizes them to attend hospital for CT thorax, Lung function test, Respiratory physician appointment and lung cancer specialist nurse review on the same day. We looked at both pathways to see the number of days it took from referral to investigations. Result(s): There was reduction in time over 6 months from GP referral to hospital appointment from a median of 12 days to 4 days on RAPID pathway. It also expedited the CT thorax from a median of 7 days to 4 days on RAPID pathway. Discussion(s): This study has shown that streamlining the pathway gives patients the opportunity to have access to appropriate services earlier. It also improves patient experience which was reflected by positive feedback provided by the patients on this pathway.lt also reduced te number of visits to the hospitals by introducing the concept of 'one stop clinic'.",Excluded

404,"Proton-beam therapy for olfactory neuroblastoma PURPOSE: To analyze the feasibility and efficacy of proton-beam therapy (PBT) for olfactory neuroblastoma (ONB) as a definitive treatment, by reviewing our preliminary experience. Olfactory neuroblastoma is a rare disease, and a standard treatment strategy has not been established. Radiation therapy for ONB is challenging because of the proximity of ONBs to critical organs. Proton-beam therapy can provide better dose distribution compared with X-ray irradiation because of its physical characteristics, and is deemed to be a feasible treatment modality., METHODS AND MATERIALS: A retrospective review was performed on 14 patients who underwent PBT for ONB as definitive treatment at the National Cancer Center Hospital East (Kashiwa, Chiba, Japan) from November 1999 to February 2005. A total dose of PBT was 65 cobalt Gray equivalents (Gy(E)), with 2.5-Gy(E) once-daily fractionations., RESULTS: The median follow-up period for surviving patients was 40 months. One patient died from disseminated disease. There were two persistent diseases, one of which was successfully salvaged with surgery. The 5-year overall survival rate was 93%, the 5-year local progression-free survival rate was 84%, and the 5-year relapse-free survival rate was 71%. Liquorrhea was observed in one patient with Kadish's stage C disease (widely destroying the skull base). Most patients experienced Grade 1 to 2 dermatitis in the acute phase. No other adverse events of Grade 3 or greater were observed according to the RTOG/EORTC acute and late morbidity scoring system., CONCLUSIONS: Our preliminary results of PBT for ONB achieved excellent local control and survival outcomes without serious adverse effects. Proton-beam therapy is considered a safe and effective modality that warrants further study.",Excluded

184,"Irradiation as a quarantine treatment for the solenopsis mealybug, Phenacoccus solenopsis Phenacoccus solenopsis is an aggressively invasive species that targets agricultural and ornamental plants, thereby threatening the world cotton industry and other crops. P. solenopsis has been listed as a quarantine insect in Europe and China. The utilization of phytosanitary irradiation as a potential treatment for disinfesting agricultural commodities in trade has expanded rapidly in recent years. A reasonable dose of radiation to eliminate P. solenopsis needs to be determined, taking into account the side effects of radiation on agricultural products and the species-specific tolerance of the insect to radiation. We applied radiation ranging from 50 to 200. Gy to P. solenopsis to determine the optimal dose. Both the radiation dose and the developmental stage of the insect were independent variables. Higher doses of radiation or lesser mature insect stages provided more effective treatment. In nymphs, a radiation dose of 100. Gy caused extinction of the irradiated population by disrupting ovary development, while 150. Gy caused 100% mortality. In adults, all tested doses of irradiation did not affect longevity, but we were able to prevent reproduction with high (150 and 200. Gy) doses. In P. solenopsis, a 100. Gy dose of radiation could eliminate the irradiated population in two generations. The mortality curve showed a steep slope beyond 150. Gy; thus, if killing all of the insects in a shorter amount of time is necessary, 200. Gy may be a reasonable dose for the quarantine treatment of the solenopsis mealybug. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.",Included

INTRODUCTION: For the induction therapy of non-small-cell lung cancer, we need to look for a regimen which produces a reliable high response rate with a low treatment related morbidity and mortality., METHODS: Patients in clinical stages IB, IIA and B, IIIA and B received a course of therapy with 20Gy of radiation in 2 weeks. This was followed by two courses of chemotherapy consisting of paclitaxel 180mg/m(2), cisplatin 45mg/m(2), and ifosfamide 1000mg/m(2). Two to 3 weeks after chemotherapy, the patients were re-evaluated and, if suitable, underwent surgical therapy., RESULTS: A total of 35 patients were entered into the study. The overall response rate was 82.86% (95% confidence interval, 66.35-94.5%). Complete response (CR) was 20% (95% confidence interval, 8.44-36.94%). Twenty-five patients had surgical resection. Subsequently 18 patients received completion radiotherapy of additional 45Gy. The median follow up is 30 months. In 12 patients with stages IB, IIA and B, the median survival was 61 months, and 5-year survival was 55%. In 23 patients with stages IIIA and B, the median survival was 26 months, and 5-year survival was 9.5%. There was 1 patient with Grade 4 and 13 patients with Grade 3 leukopenia, and half of them received granulocyte colony stimulating factor. By the completion radiotherapy, 6 out of 18 patients had less than Grade 2 esophagitis. Five patients had Grade 2 radiation pneumonitis and one Grade 5 (one mortality). There was no postoperative death. The survival results were comparable to those reported recently by others, however the regimen produced a high response rate with low treatment related morbidity/mortality., CONCLUSION: It is a suitable regimen for induction therapy to include earlier stage resectable non-small-cell lung cancers.",Excluded

METHODS Twenty treatment plans for ten patients were created using 3D-CRT of four-fields with gantry angles of 0, 90, 180, and 270; and IMRT of five-fields with gantry angles of 0, 72, 144, 216, and 288 on an Eclipse Treatment Planning System (version 15.6). The volume of reference isodose, target volume, maximum isodose in the target, reference isodose, dose at 95% of planning target volume (PTV), dose at 2%, 5%, and 98% of PTV, and prescribed dose were collected from the dose volume histogram of each plan. The conformity index and homogeneity index (HI) were then calculated. The doses of the organs at risk were also collected and evaluated. RESULTS The HI of the twenty patients who underwent the treatment plan with 3D-CRT was 1.088+/-0.03, which shows good homogeneity, but less homogeneity when compared with plans done with IMRT (1.072+/-0.02).

871,"A guide to mammography and other breast imaging procedures Mammographic studies are performed for both diagnosis of breast disease and screening for cancer. Diagnostic mammography can demonstrate the presence of breast cancer in a symptomatic patient and more specifically, the size, location and extent of tumor. Mammographic screening involves examination of asymptomatic women in an attempt to detect breast cancer before it grows large enough to be palpable. The use of diagnostic mammography is well accepted due to the compelling clinical need for the information provided. The implementation of a mammographic screening program depends upon: (1) indication of a favorable benefit/risk ratio for the population being screened; (2) availability of suitably trained radiologists, medical physicists, and technologists and appropriate mammographic equipment subject to a vigorous QA program; and (3) acceptably low cost. Breast anatomy and function must be understood (Section 2) in order to design and utilize the mammographie techniques which will effectively detect and demonstrate breast cancer. The technique which is employed for the preponderance of mammography examinations is screen-film mammography with a grid. Good screen-film mammography requires dedicated equipment which can provide an appropriate soft x-ray beam (proper choice of operating potential, target, filter, window, HVL) (Section 3), proper compression, a target-film distance of suitable length for the given focal-spot size, and provision for vertical adjustment and mechanical rotation of the tube and image-receptor assembly for proper positioning (Section 2). The two views, which are recommended, are the CC and the MLO view (Section 2) which allow more visualization of the posterior glandular tissues, particularly in the auxiliary tail than a lateral view. The lateral view should also be employed whenever a nonpalpable lesion is discovered, in order to provide accurate three-dimensional localization. Screen-film mammography should be performed by a technologist who has had special training in compression and positioning techniques for the standard and special views used for mammography (ACR, 1999). Only an intensifying screen designed specifically for mammography should be used in combination with a suitable single-emulsion film (Section 3). The combination should be placed in low-absorption cassettes designed for mammography. There are many factors which affect image quality (Section 4). The three major components of image quality are contrast, sharpness and noise. Image quality can be optimized by suitable adjustment of the x-ray spectrum (operating potential, filtration, target material), breast compression, grids, imaging geometry (small focal spot, long target-film distance), choice of screens and films, and optimization of film-processing techniques. Image quality may be checked with suitable phantoms. Section 4 provides information to allow facilities to determine whether the particular combination of x-ray machine, compression devices, technique factors and image receptors in current use, or under consideration for use, for mammography will provide optimum image quality. A major objective of mammography dosimetry is to provide relevant information so that potential radiation risks from alternative techniques may be compared. For this purpose a single-valued dose"" per view for each technique, which corresponds reasonably well to the resulting carcinogenic potential, should be determined. This task involves consideration of tissue vulnerability to radiation effects, anatomy, technique and dosimetry. In addition, a unique dose value for each technique requires that the dose be determined for a fixed-reference breast composition with breast thickness stated. Simple computational models of the breast have been developed for estimation of mammographic dose. Several assumptions are implicit in these models relating to radiation risk, breast anatomy, and technique (Section 5). Three specific points are relevant to radiation risk: (1) breast glandular tissue is most vulnerable as compared with adipose, skin and areo ar tissues; (2) an average breast dose (namely, the mean glandular dose), rather than a maximum dose, is most useful in characterizing risk of carcinogenesis consistent with a linear dose-response relationship; and (3) the population of primary interest is women 40 y and older since younger women are likely to receive only diagnostic and baseline studies. This assumption that the population of primary interest is women 40 y and older limits application of the computational models to the older on average, more adipose breast, which helps justify certain simplifying assumptions. A major technique variable is the degree of compression employed. Firm compression, which is assumed in dose computations, greatly distorts the breast anatomy, making more rectangular the sagittal and transverse cross-sections of the volume that includes the glandular tissue. This greatly simplifies the breast geometry and makes the computational models more appropriate than otherwise would be the case (Section 5). The mean glandular dose (D<inf>g</inf>) meets the stated requirements outlined above. The computational model used in this Report for D<inf>g</inf> assumes that 0.5 cm thick adipose layers enclose a central ""glandular tissue"" containing a uniform mix of glandular and adipose tissues in roughly equal amounts. The procedure for estimating mean glandular dose for a specific population of patients is described in Table 4.3 (Approach II). A basic requirement for maintaining optimum image quality in mammography is implementation of a suitable QA program (Section 6). Each of the items contributing to image quality must be evaluated on a regular basis. The quality administration program (medical audit) evaluates the appropriateness and accuracy of image interpretation (Section 6.3). The benefit from screening by mammography and physical examination in the form of decreased breast cancer mortality has long been accepted for women above age 50 on the basis of a randomized trial (the HIP study, see Section 7), which indicated that the contribution of mammography to decreased breast cancer mortality was significant in older women. The randomized clinical trials of mammographic screening have not demonstrated a benefit for women age 40 to 49, within the first 7 y of starting screening. Those trials for which 10 or more years of follow-up is available, show evidence of a 23 percent benefit in reducing mortality. Although this reduction is smaller than that observed for older women, it is statistically significant and therefore, one can reject the possibility that this may have happened by chance. Compared with mammography practiced in the previous randomized trials, high-quality modern mammography could result in increased benefit. Even a very small benefit (e.g., one percent) more than offsets any risk of radiation-induced breast cancer. The benefit versus risk will be substantial, if analysis of ongoing screening experience demonstrates a reduction in breast cancer mortality rate of 30 percent or more. Among the various imaging methods designed to evaluate the breast for cancer, mammography is the most accurate and most widely used. It has gained clinical acceptance primarily because of its ability to detect a cancer before the tumor mass becomes large enough to be palpable, thereby permitting ""early"" diagnosis. It has also been proven an invaluable tool to distinguish benign from malignant lesions and can facilitate prompt biopsy of cancers, while encouraging clinical observation (rather than biopsy) of many benign masses. Other breast imaging methods have, thus far, been considered less successful; these include thermography, transillumination, ultrasonography, and MRI and MRS all of which do not utilize ionizing radiation. Computed tomography (Section 8.4) and digital mammography (Section 3.3) which use x rays, and therefore involve the potential risk of mammary carcinogenesis are being subjected to clinical investigation to determine their role in breast cancer diagnosis. Explanations of the principles of operation, a chronology of developments, an an extensive discussion of the limitations of each of these methods is contained in Sections 3.3 and 8.4.""",Excluded

712,"Utility of Computed Tomography following Anterior Cervical Diskectomy and Fusion Study Design Retrospective case series. Objective To assess the utility of postoperative computed tomography (CT) following anterior cervical diskectomy and fusion (ACDF) and to determine the clinical circumstances most likely to lead to an abnormal CT scan. Methods Patients who underwent ACDF at a tertiary center over a span of 5 years were investigated. Only patients who had a minimum of 6 months' postoperative follow-up and a CT within 2 years after the surgery were included in the study group. All the postoperative notes were reviewed to determine indications for the CT, abnormalities identified, and whether the scan led to an alteration in the treatment course. Results The charts of 690 patients who underwent ACDF were reviewed. Of the 690 patients, 45 (7%) had postoperative CTs. These patients accounted for 53 postoperative CT scans, 45 (85%) of which were taken for patients who expressed persistent postoperative symptoms and/or had abnormal imaging. There were no indications for 8 (15%) of the CTs. Patients who had a CT for persistent symptoms and/or abnormal preliminary imaging were significantly more likely to have an abnormal CT (p = 0.03) and/or an alteration in treatment course (p = 0.04) compared with those with no symptomatic or radiologic indication for CT. Conclusions CT is associated with minimal utility regarding the alteration of treatment course when employed in asymptomatic patients. Postoperative CT should be ordered solely for symptomatic patients or those with other abnormal preliminary imaging. Judicious use of postoperative CT will limit the radiation exposure and cost.Copyright © 2015 Georg Thieme Verlag KG Stuttgart New York.",Excluded

Both reagents labeled all TDL from rats of the DA strain (Ig-1a) with two categories of cells being detected; one binding 100-2,000 molecules of antibody, the other 10,000-100,000 molecules. These categories were likely to be synonomous with T and B cells, respectively. The [(125)I]antiallotype antibodies did not bind to TDL from rats of the PVG/c strain (Ig-1b). When the binding to TDL from (PVG/c x DA)F(1) animals was studied it was found that allelic exclusion occurred in the heavily labeled cells, but not in the lightly labeled ones. Furthermore, when lymphocytes of one allotype were transferred to irradiated recipients of the opposite allotype and recovered from the TDL or spleen of the recipient 20-30 h later, the immunoglobulin on heavily labeled cells was of the donor type, while that of lightly labeled ones bore the recipient marker. Thus heavily labeled cells (B lymphocytes) had synthesized their own immunoglobulin while lightly labeled cells (T lymphocytes) had acquired theirs passively by adsorption. The class of immunoglobulin on lightly labeled cells was also studied and it was found that [(125)I]anti-IgM antibodies bound to an extent approaching the [(125)I]anti-Fab binding, while [(125)I]anti-IgG(2a+2b) antibodies gave much less binding.",Excluded

A part of the buttock was exposed to 20 J/cm2 UVA1 and another part to 126 J/cm2 of visible light three times a week for 4 weeks. Repeated punch biopsies were taken during the 4 weeks of treatment and also 2 weeks after the last irradiation. The avidin-biotin-immunoperoxidase technique was used to investigate the expression of p53, p21WAF, bcl-2, Ki67 and cyclin A. Result(s): By comparison to untreated skin, an increased expression of p53 but not p21WAF in keratinocytes was seen. The bcl-2 protein expression increased slightly after both UVA1 and visible light. An increased staining with Ki67 and cyclin A after UVA1 but not after visible light was observed as a sign of increased proliferation. Conclusion(s): These results suggest that suberythemal doses of UVA1 and even visible light may cause DNA damage.",Excluded
450,"V30 as a predictor for radiation-induced hypothyroidism: A dosimetric analysis in patients who received radiotherapy to the neck Introduction: The purpose of this study is to evaluate the possible predictors of thyroid disorders after neck radiotherapy, with a focus on radiation dose-volume factors. Method(s): Thyroid function was measured in 100 patients who had received radiotherapy to the neck, including the thyroid. All radiation-induced thyroid dysfunctions were determined with an endpoint of abnormal thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH), free triiodothyronine (fT3) and thyroxine (fT4) and thyroid peroxidase antibodies and (TPA). The total volume of the thyroid, mean radiation dose to the thyroid (Dmean) and thyroid volume percentage that received radiation doses of 10-50 Gy (V10-V50) were calculated in all patients. The evaluated risk factors for thyroid dysfunction included dose-volume parameters, sex, age, previous surgery, chemotherapy and comorbidity. Result(s): There were 52 patients with hypothyroidism and V30 (p = 0.03), thyroid volume (p = 0.01) and Dmean (p = 0.03) appeared to be correlated with hypothyroidism in univariate analysis. However, there was not association found in multivariate analysis for these factors. Conclusion(s): Thyroid disorders after radiation therapy to the neck still represent a clinically underestimated problem. V30 may be a useful tool for evaluating the risk of hypothyroidism when determining an individual patient's treatment. © 2014 Akgun et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",Excluded
429,"Evaluation of the ECAT EXACT HR+ 3-D PET scanner in H2(15)O brain activation studies: dose fractionation strategies for rCBF and signal enhancing protocols We evaluated the performance of the ECAT EXACT HR+ 3-D whole-body positron emission tomography (PET) scanner when employed to measure brain function using H2(15)O bolus activation protocols that are completed in single same-day data acquisition sessions. Using vibrotactile and auditory stimuli as independent activation tasks, we studied the scanner performance under different imaging conditions in five healthy volunteers. Cerebral blood flow images were acquired from each volunteer using H2(15)O bolus injections of activity varying from 5-20 mCi. One-session dose-fractionation strategies were analyzed for rCBF, standard activity-concentration, switched, and cold-bolus/switched protocols. Performance characteristics. The scanner dead time grew linearly with injected dose from 10% to 25%. Random events varied from 30% to 50% of the detected events. Random and scattered events were corrected adequately at all doses. Estimated noise-effective-count curves plateau at about 10 mCi. One-session 12-injection bolus PET activation protocols. Using an acquisition protocol that accounts for the scanner performance and the practical aspects of imaging volunteers and neurological patients in a single same-day session, we assessed the correlation between the significance of activation foci and the dose/injection used. The one-session protocol employs 12 bolus injections/subject. We present evidence suggesting that when an rCBF protocol is used, image noise is reduced significantly when the activity injected increases from 5 to 10 mCi. Increasing the dose from 10 to 15 or 20 mCi yielded further but smaller reductions. Our observations also suggest that image noise will be strongly reduced if a 20-mCi dose/injection is used when data are collected using protocols that employ long acquisition times such as a switched or a cold-bolus/switched protocol.",Excluded
591,"Predictors of pulmonary toxicity in limited stage small cell lung cancer patients treated with induction chemotherapy followed by concurrent platinum-based chemotherapy and 70Gy daily radiotherapy: CALGB 30904 Introduction: Standard therapy for limited stage small cell lung cancer (L-SCLC) is concurrent chemotherapy and radiotherapy followed by prophylactic cranial radiotherapy. Predictors of post chemoradiotherapy pulmonary toxicity in limited stage (LS) small cell lung cancer (SCLC) patients are not well defined. Current guidelines are derived from non-small cell lung cancer regimens, and do not account for the unique biology of this disease. Therefore, we analyzed patients on three consecutive CALGB LS-SCLC trials treated with concurrent chemotherapy and daily high dose radiotherapy (70. Gy) to determine patient and treatment related factors predicting for post-treatment pulmonary toxicity. Method(s): Patients treated on CALGB protocols 39808, 30002, 30206 investigating two cycles of chemotherapy followed by concurrent chemotherapy and 70. Gy daily thoracic radiation therapy were pooled. Patient, tumor, and treatment related factors were evaluated to determine predictors of grade 3-5 pulmonary toxicities after concurrent chemoradiotherapy. Result(s): 100 patients were included. No patient experienced grade 4-5 post-treatment pulmonary toxicity. Patients who experienced post-treatment pulmonary toxicity were more likely to be older (median age 69 vs 60, p= 0.09) and have smaller total lung volumes (2565 cc vs 3530 cc, p= 0.05).). Furthermore, exposure of larger volumes of lung to lower (median V5. = 70%, p= 0.09, median V10. = 63%, p= 0.07), intermediate (median V20. = 50, p= 0.04) and high (median V60. = 25%, p= 0.01) doses of radiation were all associated with post-treatment grade 3 pulmonary toxicity, as was a larger mean lung radiation dose (median 31. Gy) p= 0.019. Conclusion(s): Post-treatment pulmonary toxicity following the completion of 2 cycles of chemotherapy followed by concurrent chemotherapy and high dose daily radiation therapy was uncommon. Care should be taken to minimize mean lung radiation exposure, as well as volumes of low, intermediate and high doses of radiation. © 2013 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.",Excluded
902,"Optimizing cancer radiotherapy with 2-deoxy-D-glucose: Dose escalation studies in patients with glioblastoma multiforme Background and Purpose: Higher rates of glucose utilization and glycolysis generally correlate with poor prognosis in several types of malignant tumors. Own earlier studies on model systems demonstrated that the nonmetabolizable glucose analog 2-deoxy-D-glucose (2-DG) could enhance the efficacy of radiotherapy in a dose-dependent manner by selectively sensitizing cancer cells while protecting normal cells. Phase I/II clinical trials indicated that the combination of 2-DG, at an oral dose of 200 mg/kg body weight (BW), with large fractions of gamma-radiation was well tolerated in cerebral glioma patients. Since higher 2-DG doses are expected to improve the therapeutic gain, present studies were undertaken to examine the tolerance and safety of escalating 2-DG dose during combined treatment (2-DG + radiotherapy) in glioblastoma multiforme patients. Patients and Methods: Untreated patients with histologically proven glioblastoma multiforme (WHO criteria) were included in the study. Seven weekly fractions of 60Co gamma-rays (5 Gy/fraction) were delivered to the tumor volume (presurgical CT/MRI evaluation) plus 3 cm margin. Escalating 2-DG doses (200-250-300 mg/kg BW) were administered orally 30 min before irradiation after overnight fasting. Acute toxicity and tolerance were studied by monitoring the vital parameters and side effects. Late radiation damage and treatment responses were studied radiologically and clinically in surviving patients. Result(s): Transient side effects similar to hypoglycemia were observed in most of the patients. Tolerance and patient compliance to the combined treatment were very good up to a 2-DG dose of 250 mg/kg BW. However, at the higher dose of 300 mg/kg BW, two out of six patients were very restless and could not complete treatment, though significant changes in the vital parameters were not observed even at this dose. No significant damage to the normal brain tissue was observed during follow-up in seven out of ten patients who received complete treatment and survived between 11 and 46 months after treatment. Conclusion(s): Oral administration of 2-DG combined with large fractions of radiation (5 Gy/fraction/week) is safe and could be tolerated in glioblastoma patients without any acute toxicity and late radiation damage to the normal brain. Further clinical studies to evaluate the efficacy of the combined treatment are warranted. © Urban & Vogel.",Excluded
373,"Proton therapy for atypical meningiomas We report clinical outcomes of proton therapy in patients with World Health Organization grade 2 (atypical) meningiomas. Between 2005 and 2013, 22 patients with atypical meningiomas were treated to a median dose of 63 Gy (RBE) using proton therapy, as an adjuvant therapy after surgery (n = 12) or for recurrence or progression of residual tumor (n = 10). Six patients had presumed radiation-induced meningiomas, but none had received prior radiotherapy for their meningioma. The median follow-up time after radiation was 39 months (range 7-104) and all patients remain alive at last follow-up. The 5-year estimate of local control was 71.1 % (95 % CI 49.3-92.9 %). The 5-year estimate of local control was 87.5 % following a radiation dose >60 Gy (RBE), compared to 50.0 % for <=60 Gy (RBE) (p = 0.038). The 5-year estimate of neuraxis dissemination was 5 % (95 % CI 0-14.6 %) and 6.2 % (95 % CI 0-18.2 %) for metastases outside of the central nervous system. Radiation necrosis was observed in one patient with a history of prior cranial irradiation. Fractionated proton therapy was associated with favorable tumor control rates for grade 2 meningiomas. Prospective studies are needed to define the optimal radiation dose for high-grade meningiomas.Copyright © 2015, Springer Science+Business Media New York.",Excluded
288,"Patient effective radiation dose and associated risk from transmission scans using 153Gd line sources in cardiac SPECT studies The aim of the present study was to determine the contribution of transmission measurements acquisition to total patient effective dose from cardiac SPECT studies. A dual-head L-shaped gamma camera equipped with a transmission scan acquisition system based on two 153Gd line sources was used to simulate transmission measurements acquisition exposure on an anthropomorphic phantom. Thermoluminescence dosimeters were used to directly monitor the dose to 550 measuring points in the phantom. The effective dose and associated risk from transmission scans acquisition were estimated and compared to those associated to the radiopharmaceutical injected. The maximum effective dose from a typical transmission measurements acquisition was 1.3 muSv and 1.9 muSv for male and female patients, respectively. The contribution of the typical transmission scans acquisition to total patient radiation risk from a cardiac SPECT study is less than 10-3. Thus, radiation exposure may not be considered as a limiting factor for the clinical application of attenuation correction methods based on transmission measurements in cardiac SPECT.",Excluded
979,"Tryptophan metabolism in the non-tumoral hemisphere: A pet study of 99 glioma patients BACKGROUND: Positron emission tomography (PET) with alpha[11C]methyl-L-tryptophan (AMT) can track serotonin synthesis (in brain) and also the immunosuppressive kynurenine pathway (often activated in gliomas). Tumoral AMT uptake can predict tumor type and distinguish radiation injury from glioma recurrence.Now we analyzed clinical correlates of decreased AMT uptake in the contralateral hemisphere of glioma patients (reported recently: Juhasz et al. Clin Nucl Med, 2012;37:838-42). METHOD(S): We analyzed 99 (46/53 pre-/post-treatment) AMT-PET scans of patients (mean age: 52 years) with WHO grade II-IV glioma. Standardized uptake values (SUV) and unidirectional AMT uptake (K-complex, a measure of brain serotonin synthesis; available in 93 cases) were quantified in cortical and subcortical regions of the non-tumoral hemisphere. The effect of gender, age, tumor grade, and treatment on cortical/subcortical AMT uptake, and associations with survival (in the post-treatment group), were analyzed. RESULT(S): AMT K-complex was higher in females than males in the thalamus (p = .012, t-test) and frontal cortex (p = .047) in the whole group and in post-treatment patients (p = .017 and p = .009, respectively). Females also had higher thalamic SUV than males in the whole group (p = .029). AMT K-complex in the thalamus showed a moderate decline with age in the whole group (Pearson's r = -0.24; p = .009) and in the post-treatment subgroup (r = -0.34; p = .023). There was no difference in AMT-PET parameters between the pre- and post-treatment subgroups, and no correlation was found between cortical/subcorticalAMT-PET parameters and tumor grade. Higher thalamic and putaminal SUV predicted shorter survival (log-rank: p = 0.003, p = 0.013, respectively), but not independently from tumoral SUV. CONCLUSION(S): While glioma grade and treatment do not appear to directly affect tryptophan metabolism in the non-tumoral hemisphere, an age-related decline and gender differences, in subcortical structures and/or frontal cortex, may occur, particularly post-treatment. This could indicate remote serotonergic abnormalities whose relation to clinical symptoms (e.g., glioma-associated depression) and clinical outcome warrants further studies.",Excluded

731,"Comparison of dual-axis rotational coronary angiography (XPERSWING) versus conventional technique in routine practice INTRODUCTION AND OBJECTIVES: Coronary angiography is the gold standard for the study of coronary artery disease. This technique requires several orthogonal projections. Rotational angiography is a new technique which involves pre-set rotation of the X-ray tube around the patient and allows visualization of each coronary artery in different views, using a single contrast injection. The purpose of this study was to compare conventional coronary angiography (A) vs rotational angiography (B), focusing on radiation dose, amount of contrast administered, and total procedure time for both diagnostic and therapeutic percutaneous coronary interventions., METHODS: Prospective study of 104 consecutive patients undergoing coronary angiography who were randomized to one of these techniques., RESULTS: We found a significant reduction in the amount of contrast administered (A vs B, 93.1 [41.7] vs 50.9 [14.7] mL; P<.0001) and radiation exposure (27.6 [11.5] vs 18 [6.4] mGycm(2); P<.0001). A significant increase in total procedure time was noted in the rotational angiography arm. However, when only the last 50 patients were analyzed, we found no difference in procedure time between the groups, probably related to the learning curve of the operators. Angioplasty was performed in 29 patients in group A and 28 patients in group B. Contrast reduction was maintained in the rotational angiography group compared to the conventional technique (A vs B, 335.1 [192.1] vs 238.5 [114.4] mL; P=.02)., CONCLUSIONS: The rotational angiography technique leads to a significant decrease in radiation exposure and contrast dose administered for diagnostic procedures when compared to conventional coronary angiography. In patients who undergo percutaneous coronary intervention, contrast reduction remains significant. Copyright © 2011 Sociedad Espanola de Cardiologia. Published by Elsevier Espana.

762,"Measurement of lung airways in three dimensions using hyperpolarized helium-3 MRI Large airway measurement is clinically important in cases of airway disease and trauma. The gold standard is computed tomography (CT), which allows for airway measurement. However, the ionizing radiation dose associated with CT is a major limitation in longitudinal studies and trauma. To avoid ionizing radiation from CT, we present a method for measuring the large airway diameter in humans using hyperpolarized helium-3 (HPHe) MRI in conjunction with a dynamic 3D radial acquisition. An algorithm is introduced which utilizes the significant airway contrast for semi-automated segmentation and skeletonization which is used to derive the airway lumen diameter. The HPHe MRI method was validated with quantitative CT in an excised and desiccated porcine lung (linear regression R(2) = 0.974 and slope = 0.966 over 32 airway segments). The airway lumen diameters were then compared in 24 human subjects (22 asthmatics and 2 normals; linear regression R(2) value of 0.799 and slope = 0.768 over 309 airway segments).

Method(s): We retrospectively analyzed 208 consecutive patients (146 men and 62 women) with NSCLC treated with 3D-CRT. The median age of the patients was 64 years (range 35-87 years). The clinical and treatment parameters including gender, age, performance status, sequential chemotherapy, concurrent chemotherapy, presence of carinal or subcarinal lymph nodes, pretreatment weight loss, mean dose to the entire esophagus, maximal point dose to the esophagus, and percentage of volume of esophagus receiving >55 Gy were studied. Clinical and dosimetric factors for radiation-induced acute and late grade 3-5 esophageal injury were analyzed according to Radiation Therapy Oncology Group (RTOG) criteria. Result(s): Twenty-five (12%) of the two hundred and eight patients developed acute or late grade 3-5 esophageal injury. Among them, nine patients had both acute and late grade 3-5 esophageal injury, two died of late esophageal perforation. Concurrent chemotherapy and maximal point dose to the esophagus >=60 Gy were significantly associated with the risk of grade 3-5 esophageal injury. Fifty-four (26%) of the two hundred and eight patients received concurrent chemotherapy. Among them, 25 (46%) developed grade 3-5 esophageal injury (P=0.0001<0.01). However, no grade 3-5 esophageal injury occurred in patients who received a maximal point dose to the esophagus <60 Gy (P=0.0001<0.01).

1182,"Clinical and Spectrophotometric Evaluation of Skin Photoadaptation in Vitiligo Patients after a Short Cycle of NB-UVB Phototherapy BACKGROUND: The phenomenon of photoadaptation to narrow-band ultraviolet B (NB-UVB) radiation has been previously described in vitiligo and has usually been clinically measured by the assessment of the minimal erythema dose (MED) after phototesting., OBJECTIVES: To assess the photoadaptive response in vitiligo and healthy skin after NB-UVB phototherapy not only clinically, but also by spectrophotometry., MATERIALS AND METHODS: Fourteen patients affected by generalized vitiligo underwent NB-UVB phototherapy twice weekly for 12 weeks. Before and after phototherapy, a phototesting procedure was administered on vitiligo patches and adjacent healthy skin with a solar simulated radiation (SSR). Visual assessment of the MED took place after 24 h. A spectrophotometer was used to assess the a* value and the melanin index (MI*), as signs of skin erythema and pigmentation. The photoadaptation factor (MED-PF) and the a* photoadaptation factor (a*-PF) were calculated., RESULTS: After NB-UVB phototherapy, both vitiligo and healthy skin showed an increase in MED and MI* values and a reduction of skin erythema compared to baseline (p < 0.05). MED-PF data showed a photoadaptation in 10 (71.4%) vitiligo lesions and in 12 (85.7%) healthy skin areas. The assessment of the a*-PF showed a negative mean percentage value in all affected and unaffected skin areas., CONCLUSIONS: A short cycle of NB-UVB phototherapy can induce photoadaptation in vitiligo by increasing the MED and reducing skin erythema after stimulation with SSR. This is most likely due to the physical filter function induced by ultraviolet radiation. Copyright © 2019 S. Karger AG, Basel.",Excluded

803,"Efficacy of argon plasma coagulation compared with topical formalin application for chronic radiation proctopathy Background: Chronic radiation proctopathy (CRP) is a troublesome complication of radiotherapy to the pelvis for which current treatment modalities are suboptimal. Currently, the application of formalin to the rectal mucosa (AFR) and thermal ablation with argon plasma coagulation (APC) are the most promising options. Objective(s): To compare the efficacy and safety of AFR with APC for CRP. Patients and Methods: Records of 22 patients (male to female ratio, 19:3; mean age, 74 years) who received either APC or AFR for chronic hematochezia caused by CRP, and who were evaluated and treated between May 1998 and April 2002, were reviewed. Complete evaluations were made three months after completion of each therapeutic modality. Patients were considered to be responders if there was a 10% increase in hemoglobin from baseline or complete normalization of hemoglobin (male patients, higher than 130 g/L; female patients, higher than 115 g/L) without the requirement for blood transfusion. Result(s): The mean hemoglobin level before therapy was 107 g/L. Patients received an average of 1.78 sessions for APC and 1.81 sessions for AFR. Eleven patients (50%) were treated with APC alone, eight patients (36%) with AFR alone and three (14%) with both modalities (two with AFR followed by APC, and one with APC followed by AFR). Eleven of 14 patients (79%) in the APC group were responders, compared with three of 11 patients (27%) in the AFR group (P=0.017). In the APC group, seven of 11 responders required only a single session, while in the AFR group, only one patient responded after a single session. Adverse events (nausea, vomiting, flushing, abdominal cramps, rectal pain and fever) occurred in two patients after APC and in nine patients after AFR (P=0.001). In the APC group, the mean hemoglobin level increase was 20 g/ L at three months follow-up, compared with 14 g/L in the AFR group. Conclusion(s): This retrospective study suggests that APC is more effective and safe than topical AFR to control hematochezia caused by CRP. Further studies are needed to confirm this observation. © 2008 Pulsus Group Inc. All rights reserved.",Excluded

75,"Targeted alpha particle immunotherapy for myeloid leukemia Unlike beta particle-emitting isotopes, a emitters can selectively kill individual cancer cells with a single atomic decay. HuM195, a humanized anti-CD33 monoclonal antibody, specifically targets myeloid leukemia cells and has activity against minimal disease. When labeled with the beta-emitters 131I and 90Y, HuM195 can eliminate large leukemic burdens in patients, but it produces prolonged myelosuppression requiring hematopoietic stem cell transplantation at high doses. To enhance the potency of native HuM195 yet avoid the nonspecific cytotoxicity of beta-emitting constructs, the alpha-emitting isotope 213Bi was conjugated to HuM195. Eighteen patients with relapsed and refractory acute myelogenous leukemia or chronic myelomonocytic leukemia were treated with 10.36 to 37.0 MBq/kg 213Bi-HuM195. No significant extramedullary toxicity was seen. All 17 evaluable patients developed myelosuppression, with a median time to recovery of 22 days. Nearly all the 213Bi-HuM195 rapidly localized to and was retained in areas of leukemic involvement, including the bone marrow, liver, and spleen. Absorbed dose ratios between these sites and the whole body were 1000-fold greater than those seen with beta-emitting constructs in this antigen system and patient population. Fourteen (93%) of 15 evaluable patients had reductions in circulating blasts, and 14 (78%) of 18 patients had reductions in the percentage of bone marrow blasts.

364,"Short-course preoperative radiotherapy with delayed surgery in rectal cancer - a retrospective study PURPOSE: In the most advanced, non-resectable primary rectal cancers, conventional long-course radiotherapy (RT) (1.8-2Gyx25-28), frequently combined with chemotherapy, has been used since tumour regression is needed in order to allow a radical (R0) resection. In Uppsala, short-course 5x5Gy with planned delayed surgery has been used in patients with contraindications to long-course RT (+/-chemotherapy). The aim is to describe our experience of using this approach in patients not eligible for standard treatment., PATIENTS AND METHODS: During 2002 and 2005, 46 patients with non-resectable rectal cancer (+/-synchronous distant metastases) were treated with 5x5Gy and delayed surgery if possible. The clinical records were retrospectively evaluated. The first group (A) had no metastases (T4NXM0), whereas the other two groups (B+C) had metastases (T4NXM1). In group (B), the patients had predominantly loco-regional disease and were not candidates for combination chemotherapy (high age, co-morbidities), and in group (C) up-front combination chemotherapy was given, with the intention to have surgery of both the primary and the secondaries if sufficient regression at both sites were seen., RESULTS: The patients in the first two groups (A+B) were old (median 79 and 76 years, respectively), and had several co-morbidities. In group (C), median age was 63 years. The 5x5Gy RT was well tolerated by most patients, but grade IV diarrhoea was recorded in three elderly patients. One patient in the group (C) died from neutropenic fever. Many patients were reported to have less local symptoms after the treatment given. Delayed surgery was performed in all but nine patients. Radical surgery (R0+R1) was performed in 22 (92%) (group A), 4 (44%) (group B), and 6 (46%) (group C) patients, respectively. A pCR was seen in four patients (two in group A and two in group C). No postoperative deaths occurred., CONCLUSIONS: Considering the very high age and presence of co-morbidity, the 5x5Gy schedule is well tolerated. Further, considering the very advanced local stage, the schedule has considerable anti-tumour activity and can result in radical surgery in a high proportion of patients.",Excluded

Design Retrospective interventional case series. Methods This study included patients presenting with symptomatic exudative retinal papillary capillary hemangioma with or without association with von Hippel-Lindau disease. All patients were treated either as a first or a secondary treatment option by proton beam therapy between 2001 and 2009. The minimum follow-up was 30 months. Results Eight eyes of 8 patients (3 male and 5 female, with a mean age of 36 years [range 22-80 years]) were treated for symptomatic papillary retinal hemangioma.

Mean visual acuity prior to proton beam irradiation was 0.7 logMAR (0.2 DIN (DIN 58220 norm)) (range 2-0.3 logMAR) and declined to 0.8 logMAR (0.16 DIN; range 2-0.1 logMAR) at last follow-up examination (no statistical significance, P =.071). Conclusion The anatomic outcome after proton beam therapy for retinal papillary hemangioma is convincing, whereas functional outcome may be compromised because of tumor location, long-persisting macular edema, extensive exudation, and poor initial visual acuity. In patients with extended retinal detachment surgical intervention was still necessary. Although proton beam therapy is proven to be a therapeutic option, treatment will remain challenging. © 2014 by Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.",Excluded
207,"Effects of curcumin based PDT on the viability and the organization of actin in melanotic (A375) and amelanotic melanoma (C32) - in vitro studies Curcumin is a turmeric, antioxidative compound, well-known of its anti-cancer properties. Nowadays more and more effort is made in the field of enhancing the efficiency of the anticancer therapies. Combining the photoactive properties of curcumin with the superficial localization of melanoma and photodynamic therapy (PDT) seems to be a promising treatment method. The research focused on the evaluation of the curcumin effectiveness as an anticancer therapeutic agent in the in vitro treatment of melanotic (A375) and amelanotic (C32) melanoma cell lines. Keratinocytes (HaCat) and fibroblasts (HGF) were used to assess the impact of the therapy on the skin tissue. The aim of the study was to investigate the cell death after exposure to light irradiation after preincubation with curcumin. Additionaly the authors analized the interactions between curcumin and the actin cytoskeleton. The cytotoxic effect initiated by curcumin and increased by irradiation confirm the usefulness of the flavonoid in the PDT approach. Depending on curcumin concentration and incubation time, melanoma cells survival rate ranged from: 93.68 % (C32 cell line, 10 muM, 24 h) and 83.47 % (A375 cell line, 10 muM, 24 h) to 8.98 % (C32 cell line, 50 muM, 48 h) and 12.42 % (A375 cell line, 50 muM, 48 h). Moreover, photodynamic therapy with curcumin increased the number of apoptotic and necrotic cells in comparison to incubation with curcumin without irradiation. The study demonstrated that PDT induced caspase-3 overexpression and DNA cleavage in the studied cell lines. The cells revealed decreased proliferation after the therapy due to the actin cytoskeleton rearrangement. Although effective, the therapy remains not selective towards melanoma cells.

1083,"Antibiotic protocol for the prevention of osteoradionecrosis following dental extractions in irradiated head and neck cancer patients: A 10 years prospective study Aims of Study: The aim of the study was to establish the long term efficacy of a perioperative antibiotic protocol combined with antibacterial mouthwashes in preventing osteoradionecrosis (ORN). Material(s) and Method(s): Irradiated head and neck cancer patients reporting for dental extractions were prospectively enrolled to the study between January 2002 and December 2009. Selection criteria for the patients included the presence of nonrestorable tooth/teeth in the field of radiation, latency period of 6 months since completion of radiotherapy, radiation dosages >60 Gy, and availability for follow-up. Starting from 10 days preextraction, the patients were prescribed 8th hourly oral amoxicillin 500 mg along with 12th hourly mouthwashes using 10 ml of undiluted chlorhexidine gluconate 0.2% solution. The same prescription was continued for 7 days postextraction. All patients were followed-up at regular intervals until December 2013. Result(s): A total of 89 patients (55 male and 34 female) underwent extractions of teeth which were present in the radiation field. Mean age of the patients was 41.8 years (range 36-54 years) and extractions were done between 12 and 33 months (mean - 15 months) postradiation therapy. Altogether, 232 teeth were extracted (maxilla - 78/mandible - 154) at an average of 2.6 teeth per patients. After a mean follow-up period of 63 months (range 48-123 months) there were no reported cases of ORN. Conclusion(s): Based on the results of this study, perioperative oral antibiotics in combination with antibacterial mouthwashes are effective in preventing ORN following dental extractions in irradiated patients.",Excluded
953,"Low-dose computed tomographic urography using adaptive iterative dose reduction 3-dimensional: Comparison with routine-dose computed tomography with filtered back projection OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to evaluate the image quality of low-dose computed tomographic (CT) urography using adaptive iterative dose reduction 3-dimensional (AIDR 3D) compared with routine-dose CT using filtered back projection (FBP). METHOD(S): Thirty patients underwent low- and routine-dose CT scans in the nephrographic and excretory phases of CT urography. Low-dose CT was reconstructed with AIDR 3D, and routine-dose CT was reconstructed with FBP. In quantitative analyses, image noises were measured on the renal cortex, aorta, retroperitoneal fat, and psoas muscle in both CT scans and compared. Qualitative analyses of the urinary system were performed in both CT scans and compared. These results were compared on the basis of the body mass index (BMI) of the patients. The CT dose index (CTDIvol) was measured, and the dose reduction was calculated. RESULT(S): In quantitative analyses, image noises in all organs on low-dose CT were less than those on routine-dose CT in both phases independently of the patient's BMI. There were no statistical differences between low- and routine-dose CT for diagnostic acceptability on all urinary systems in both phases independently of the patient's BMI. The average CTDIvol on routine-dose CT was 14.5 mGy in the nephrographic phase and 9.2 mGy in the excretory phase. The average CTDIvol on low-dose CT was 4.2 mGy in the nephrographic phase and 2.7 mGy in the excretory phase. CONCLUSION(S): Low-dose CT urography using AIDR 3D can offer diagnostic acceptability comparable with routine-dose CT urography with FBP with approximately 70% dose reduction.

213,"Clinicopathologic features as stronger prognostic factors than histology or grade in risk stratification of primary parotid malignancies BACKGROUND: The aim of this study, using a retrospective chart review as the primary study design, was to determine the relative contribution of clinicopathologic risk factors versus low- and high-risk grade histologic groups to assist management of primary parotid cancers.
METHODS: In all, 168 primary parotid malignancies were treated surgically at a tertiary care center from 1982 to 2005. Of these, 115 patients with complete follow-up information were further analyzed. Pathologic updating and reclassification in 28% of cases enabled comparison of tumor histology or grade with current consensus criteria. Clinical outcomes of high- and low-risk histology and grade were compared with the influence of traditional clinicopathologic risk factors.
RESULTS: Of 115 cases, the male:female ratio was equal and the median age was 63 years (range, 15 to 89 years). Mucoepidermoid carcinoma (n = 28) was the most common histology. The median follow-up was 44 months (range, 0–278 months). Of low-risk histology patients who underwent neck dissection 40% had pN+ disease. The median time to recurrence was not reached for low-risk tumors, compared with 29 months for high-risk tumors (p = .0001). Interestingly, extracapsular spread (ECS) and margin status were independent prognostic factors and conferred significantly greater prognostic value than histologic grade risk group. Disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS) at 5 years for the entire cohort were 51% and 57%, respectively. Risk group was a strong independent predictor of OS but not DFS.
CONCLUSIONS: Risk group defined by histology and grade was associated with DFS. ECS and margin status were independent predictors of DFS. Inclusion of ECS and margin status substantially improved the prediction of disease recurrence, supporting elective neck dissection and postoperative radiotherapy for high-grade tumors or low-risk histologies with positive margins or ECS.",Excluded
331,"Adaptive Iterative Dose Reduction using three Dimensional processing (AIDR3D) improves chest CT image quality and reduces radiation exposure Objective: To assess the advantages of Adaptive Iterative Dose Reduction using Three Dimensional Processing (AIDR3D) for image quality improvement and dose reduction for chest computed tomography (CT). Method(s): Institutional Review Boards approved this study and informed consent was obtained. Eighty-eight subjects underwent chest CT at five institutions using identical scanners and protocols. During a single visit, each subject was scanned using different tube currents: 240, 120, and 60 mA. Scan data were converted to images using AIDR3D and a conventional reconstruction mode (without AIDR3D). Using a 5-point scale from 1 (non-diagnostic) to 5 (excellent), three blinded observers independently evaluated image quality for three lung zones, four patterns of lung disease (nodule/mass, emphysema, bronchiolitis, and diffuse lung disease), and three mediastinal measurements (small structure visibility, streak artifacts, and shoulder artifacts). Differences in these scores were assessed by Scheffe's test. Result(s): At each tube current, scans using AIDR3D had higher scores than those without AIDR3D, which were significant for lung zones (p<0.0001) and all mediastinal measurements (p<0.01). For lung diseases, significant improvements with AIDR3D were frequently observed at 120 and 60 mA. Scans with AIDR3D at 120 mA had significantly higher scores than those without AIDR3D at 240 mA for lung zones and mediastinal streak artifacts (p<0.0001), and slightly higher or equal scores for all other measurements. Scans with AIDR3D at 60 mA were also judged superior or equivalent to those without AIDR3D at 120 mA.

1103,"[Half-body irradiation. Palliative efficacy and predictive factors of response in 78 procedures] BACKGROUND: Assessment of palliative effect of hemibody irradiation (HBI) and response-related factors., METHODS: Analysis of prospective collected data of 78 procedures on 71 patients with multiple symptomatic bone metastases, treated with 6 Gy (upper half-body) or 8 Gy (lower half-body) HBI in single fraction. Clinical improvement was quantified by self-evaluation on a visual analogic scale (SVAS) before HBI, and at 24, 48 and 72 hours, at 7 days, and at each monthly control until patient's death. Univariate analysis included: sex, Karnofsky's index, tumor origin, histology, HBI dose, and SVAS before treatment. For statistical purposes the significance level was 0.05., RESULTS: Complete (37.5%) or partial responses were observed in 72/78 (92.3%) procedures, 80% appearing during the first 72 hours. Difference between mean SVAS, before and after treatment (7.7 +/- 1.5 vs 2.8 +/- 2.5), was statistically significant (p < 0.001). A mean response duration of 101 days over a mean overall survival of 141 days implies the 70% of expected patient's life span. Any analyzed prognostic factor does not correlate significantly with HBI response., CONCLUSIONS: HBI is a powerful palliative treatment in patients with multiple symptomatic bone metastasis.",Excluded
1028,"Targeting the achilles' shield of triple-negative breast cancers by androgen blockade Purpose/Objective(s): Triple-negative breast cancers (TNBC) account for 15-20% of breast carcinomas and are defined by their lack of ER/PR expression, along with the absence of HER2 overexpression or gene amplification. The lack of recognized targets coupled with its aggressive biology makes this subset of breast cancer a subject of intensive effort for new molecular target identification. Several phase III clinical trials have shown a clear benefit in overall survival with androgen-deprivation therapy for prostate cancer patients with intermediate- and high-risk disease. In preclinical data, a subset of AR positive, TNBC are dependent on androgen receptor signaling for growth although the degree of dependency is substantially less than that observed in prostate cancer. The differential dependence on androgen signaling in prostate cancers versus breast cancers that express AR remain poorly understood. Materials/Methods: We previously developed a platform that makes possible the profiling of cancer cell line survival to DNA-damaging insults in high-throughput capacity. We used this technology to study the radiosensitivity of 28 breast cancer cell lines annotated by the Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia (CCLE) project. Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) was performed to correlate radiosensitivity with gene expression features of the assayed cell lines. We validated our results using cellular based assays and orthotopic mouse xenografts. Result(s): We demonstrate that: 1) androgens and a subset of androgen precursors protect breast cancer cells from ionizing radiation by minimizing DNA damage and enhancing repair; 2) androgen blockade significantly sensitizes breast cancer cells that express AR to DNA damage both in vitro and in vivo, despite a modest effect on growth in both cell lines and in orthotopic cell line xenograft models; and 3) the response of TNBC cell lines to androgen blockade is heterogeneous, with resistance to antiandrogen therapy being mediated in part by intratumoral steroid biosynthesis including the conversion of the weak adrenal androgens like androstenedione into the AR ligands testosterone and dihydrotestosterone. Conclusion(s): Our results establish multiple lines of evidence that androgen signaling confers therapeutic resistance and is a targetable event that can be exploited for therapeutic benefit in TNBC.",Excluded
278,"Radiation-induced rib fracture after stereotactic body radiotherapy with a total dose of 54-56 Gy given in 9-7 fractions for patients with peripheral lung tumor: impact of maximum dose and fraction size BACKGROUND: Radiation-induced rib fracture after stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) for lung cancer has been recently reported. However, incidence of radiation-induced rib fracture after SBRT using moderate fraction sizes with a long-term follow-up time are not clarified. We examined incidence and risk factors of radiation-induced rib fracture after SBRT using moderate fraction sizes for the patients with peripherally located lung tumor., METHODS: During 2003-2008, 41 patients with 42 lung tumors were treated with SBRT to 54-56 Gy in 9-7 fractions. The endpoint in the study was radiation-induced rib fracture detected by CT scan after the treatment. All ribs where the irradiated doses were more than 80% of prescribed dose were selected and contoured to build the dose-volume histograms (DVHs). Comparisons of the several factors obtained from the DVHs and the probabilities of rib fracture calculated by Kaplan-Meier method were performed in the study., RESULTS: Median follow-up time was 68 months. Among 75 contoured ribs, 23 rib fractures were observed in 34% of the patients during 16-48 months after SBRT, however, no patients complained of chest wall pain. The 4-year probabilities of rib fracture for maximum dose of ribs (Dmax) more than and less than 54 Gy were 47.7% and 12.9% (p = 0.0184), and for fraction size of 6, 7 and 8 Gy were 19.5%, 31.2% and 55.7% (p = 0.0458), respectively. Other factors, such as D2cc, mean dose of ribs, V10-55, age, sex, and planning target volume were not significantly different., CONCLUSIONS: The doses and fractionations used in this study resulted in no clinically significant rib fractures for this population, but that higher Dmax and dose per fraction treatments resulted in an increase in asymptomatic grade 1 rib fractures.",Excluded
978,"Management of mandibular osteoradionecrosis corresponding to the severity of osteoradionecrosis and the method of radiotherapy PURPOSE: : To demonstrate appropriate treatment methods for mandibular osteoradionecrosis (ORN) by evaluating previous results., METHODS: : The relationship between the time interval after radiation therapy (RT) and the severity of ORN was examined. Eighty-seven patients were classified according to the extent of the lesion (grades), and the cure rates were calculated according to the RT modality, the grade, and the treatment method for ORN., RESULTS: : The later ORN developed and the higher the dose of irradiation, particularly among the patients who received external RT, the more it progressed. The initial cure rates for conservative management, marginal, and segmental mandibulectomy were 39.7%, 50%, and 86.7%, respectively., CONCLUSIONS: : Conservative management should be limited to early-onset ORN after brachytherapy with or without a low dose of external irradiation. Marginal mandibulectomy is appropriate for the late-onset ORN after brachytherapy with or without low-dose external irradiation. Segmental mandibulectomy is required for late-onset ORN after a high dose of external irradiation. Copyright 2003 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. Head Neck 25: 181-186, 2003",Excluded
545,"Exploring lag and duration effect of sunshine in triggering suicide BACKGROUND: Sunshine is considered to have a beneficial impact on mood. Interestingly, it has been consistently found that the incidence of suicide reaches a peak during early summer., METHODS: In order to explore the pattern of sunshine and suicide risk in a time frame of up to nine days and investigate possible lag and duration parameters of sunshine in the triggering of suicide, Greek daily suicide and solar radiance data were analyzed for a 10-year period using logistic regression models., RESULTS: The solar radiance during the day before the suicide event was significantly associated with an increased suicide risk (OR=1.020 per MW/m2). The average solar radiance during the four previous days was also significantly associated with an increased suicide risk (OR=1.031 per MW/m2). Differences among genders include the longer sunshine exposure needed in males to trigger suicide, compared to females and a lag period of three to four days that was found to lapse in females till the suicide. The increase in suicide risk in June compared to December, attributable to the daily sunshine effect, varies from 52% to 88%, thus explaining the already known suicide monthly seasonality., LIMITATIONS: No individual data on solar radiance exposure, mental disorders, alcohol consumption or suicide method were available., CONCLUSION: The effect of sunshine in the triggering of suicide may be mediated through a mechanism with a specific lag and duration effect, during the nine days preceding suicide. We hypothesize that sunshine acts as a natural antidepressant which first improves motivation, then only later improves mood, thereby creating a potential short-term increased risk of suicide initially upon its application.",Excluded
194,"Adaptive statistical iterative reconstruction versus filtered back projection in the same patient: 64 channel liver CT image quality and patient radiation dose OBJECTIVES: To compare routine dose liver CT reconstructed with filtered back projection (FBP) versus low dose images reconstructed with FBP and adaptive statistical iterative reconstruction (ASIR)., METHODS: In this retrospective study, patients had a routine dose protocol reconstructed with FBP, and again within 17 months (median 6.1 months), had a low dose protocol reconstructed twice, with FBP and ASIR. These reconstructions were compared for noise, image quality, and radiation dose., RESULTS: Nineteen patients were included. (12 male, mean age 58). Noise was significantly lower in low dose images reconstructed with ASIR compared to routine dose images reconstructed with FBP (liver: p < .05, aorta: p < 0.001). Low dose FBP images were scored significantly lower for subjective image quality than low dose ASIR (2.1 +/- 0.5, 3.2 +/- 0.8, p < 0.001). There was no difference in subjective image quality scores between routine dose FBP images and low dose ASIR images (3.6 +/- 0.5, 3.2 +/- 0.8, NS). Radiation dose was 41% less for the low dose protocol (4.4 +/- 2.4 mSv versus 7.5 +/- 5.5 mSv, p < 0.05)., CONCLUSIONS: Our initial results suggest low dose CT images reconstructed with ASIR may have lower measured noise, similar image quality, yet significantly less radiation dose compared with higher dose images reconstructed with FBP.",Excluded
368,"The relationship between tumor volume changes and serial plasma osteopontin detection during radical radiotherapy of non-small-cell lung cancer The prognostic quality of increased osteopontin (OPN) plasma levels has been demonstrated for the chemotherapy and surgery of lung cancer. There is also evidence in the literature that tumor volume impacts prognosis in definitive radiotherapy (RT) of (lung) cancer. We previously demonstrated that elevated plasma levels of OPN before, and increasing OPN plasma levels after RT significantly correlate with survival and outcome after curative-intent RT of non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Tumor volume was also associated with prognosis. The present prospective clinical study investigated the prognostic interrelation of OPN plasma levels and tumor volume and their changes in the radical RT of NSCLC. We evaluated a subset of patients (n=27) with inoperable, non-metastasized NSCLC of the previously published patient collective. Patients were treated with radical radiochemotherapy (2 Gy ad 66 Gy). OPN plasma concentrations were determined by ELISA before (t0), at the end (t1), and 4 weeks after RT (t2). GTV was delineated PET- and CT-correlated before RT (GTV1) and after 40 Gy (GTV2). The course of OPN during and after RT and the change of GTV during RT was monitored over time and correlated with prognosis. Median GTV2 after 40 Gy (63 ml) was significantly lower than pre-RT GTV1 (90 ml, P<0.0001). Median OPN before (t0), at the end of (t1) and four weeks after RT (t2) was 846, 777 and 624 ng/ml and not significantly different. GTV significantly declined by 39 ml during RT (P<0.0001) and OPN non-significantly decreased by 56 ng/ml during (t0 to t1) and by 54 ng/ml after RT (t1 to t2). No correlations were determined between absolute OPN and GTV values or their relative changes during RT. In univariate analysis, only GTV2 significantly predicted overall survival (OS, P=0.03). In multivariate analysis, both OPN t1 (P<0.001) and GTV2 (P=0.001) remained significant predictors of OS. Relative OPN plasma level changes after (t1 to t2) and GTV changes during RT (GTV 1 to GTV 2) significantly predicted OS (P=0.02). The combination of absolute GTV values before RT (GTV1) and GTV changes during RT (GTV1 to 2) were significantly associated with OS in both uni- and multivariate analysis (P=0.03). The combination of absolute OPN plasma levels and their changes with GTV and its changes did not reach statistical significance. The lack of a significant correlation between OPN and GTV together with the finding that OPN and GTV remained independent predictors of survival outcome but were not associated with OS in combination supports the hypothesis that tumor volume (GTV) and OPN plasma levels (both their changes and absolute values) are not interrelated in terms of prognosis but do possess each parameter separately, a prognostic quality in the radical RT of NSCLC which justifies further prospective studies to validate these results.Copyright © 2016, Spandidos Publications.

577,"Texture analysis for the assessment of structural changes in parotid glands induced by radiotherapy BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: During radiotherapy (RT) for head-and-neck cancer, parotid glands undergo significant anatomic, functional and structural changes which could characterize pre-clinical signs of an increased risk of xerostomia. Texture analysis is proposed to assess structural changes of parotids induced by RT, and to investigate whether early variations of textural parameters (such as mean intensity and fractal dimension) can predict parotid shrinkage at the end of treatment., MATERIAL AND METHODS: Textural parameters and volumes of 42 parotids from 21 patients treated with intensity-modulated RT for nasopharyngeal cancer were extracted from CT images. To individuate which parameters changed during RT, a Wilcoxon signed-rank test between textural indices (first and second RT week; first and last RT week) was performed. Discriminant analysis was applied to variations of these parameters in the first two weeks of RT to assess their power in predicting parotid shrinkage at the end of RT., RESULTS: A significant decrease in mean intensity (1.7 HU and 3.8 HU after the second and last weeks, respectively) and fractal dimension (0.016 and 0.021) was found. Discriminant analysis, based on volume and fractal dimension, was able to predict the final parotid shrinkage (accuracy of 71.4%)., CONCLUSION: Textural features could be used in combination with volume to characterize structural modifications on parotid glands and to predict parotid shrinkage at the end of RT.

1205,"Study of quantitative oral radioactivity in salivary gland scintigraphy and determination of the clinical stage of Sjogren's syndrome In this study, the oral radioactivity seen in salivary gland scintigraphy, which was established entirely on the basis of radioactive saliva secreted by the parotid and submandibular glands, was evaluated quantitatively in healthy volunteers and in patients with Sjogren's syndrome. Method(s): Salivary gland scintigraphy and labial biopsy were performed on 70 patients with Sjogren's syndrome. After intravenous administration of 99mTc-sodium pertechnetate, dynamic scintigraphy was performed and time-activity curves for the oral cavity and four major salivary glands were generated. Lemon juice stimulation was delivered at 40 min. The prestimulatory oral activity index, post-stimulatory oral activity index, and time interval between the vascular perfusion peak and the prestimulated maximum oral activity point were calculated to quantify the oral activity. Other glandular functional parameters - namely, maximum accumulation (MA), maximum secretion, secretion velocity, time at maximum count, time interval from stimulation to minimum count, and uptake ratio (UR) of the parotid and submandibular glands - were also calculated. Salivary gland scintigraphy was also performed on 21 healthy subjects with no evidence of salivary gland malfunction. Result(s): Histopathologic grade 1 or 2 was found in 29 patients and grade 3 or 4 was found in 41 patients, and they were regarded as being in the early and advanced stages of Sjogren's syndrome, respectively. After overall analysis, all of the oral activity indices and the MA and UR of the submandibular gland clearly decreased as clinical severity progressed, and statistically significant differences were observed. Conclusion(s): New oral activity indices correlated with the stage of Sjogren's syndrome, and these quantitative oral indices together with certain glandular parameters (mainly MA and UR of the submandibular gland) were found to be sensitive enough to distinguish the disease severity of Sjogren's syndrome.",Excluded
686,"Iterative reconstruction: comparison of techniques for reduced-dose liver computed tomography following transarterial chemoembolization for hepatocellular carcinoma Background Adaptive statistical iterative reconstruction (ASIR) and model-based iterative reconstruction (MBIR) algorithms have the potential to reduce dose while maintaining image quality. Purpose To compare computed tomography (CT) image quality and diagnostic performance among three reconstruction techniques - ASIR, MBIR, and filtered back projection (FBP) - after transcatheter arterial chemoembolization (TACE) of hepatocellular carcinomas (HCC). Material and Methods Of 60 patients that underwent initial TACE for HCCs, half underwent dynamic liver CT with conventional scanning protocol, and the other half with dose reduction to approximately 60% of conventional exposure. All images were reconstructed using three algorithms: FBP, ASIR, and MBIR. For objective analysis, image noise and signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) were compared. For subjective analysis, three radiologists independently assessed image quality. Ability to detect viable HCCs was also evaluated. Results MBIR and ASIR produced images with less noise and higher SNR compared with FBP regardless of radiation dosage ( P < 0.017). However, in terms of subjective parameters, such as image blotchiness, artifacts, and overall quality, MBIR was inferior to FBP and ASIR ( P < 0.001). Regarding diagnostic performance, there were no significant differences among reviewers in the detection of viable HCCs depending on the reconstruction algorithm, regardless of the dose reduction protocol ( P > 0.017). Conclusion Although subjective evaluations suggest that MBIR images are of lower quality compared with FBP and ASIR regardless of radiation dosage, there were no significant differences among reconstruction algorithms in diagnosis of viable HCC after TACE.",Excluded
135,"Simulator training reduces radiation exposure and improves trainees' performance in placing electrophysiologic catheters during patient-based procedures Background: Currently, training in interventional electrophysiology is based on conventional methodologies, and a paucity of data on the usefulness of simulation in this field is available. Objective(s): The purpose of this study was to evaluate the impact of simulator training on trainees' performance in electrophysiologic catheter placement during the early phase of their learning curve. Method(s): Inexperienced electrophysiology fellows were considered. A hybrid high-fidelity simulator (Procedicus VIST, version 7.0, Mentice AB Gothenburg, Sweden for Biosense Webster) was used. The following parameters were evaluated in 3 consecutive patient-based procedures before and after two training sessions of at least 1.5 hours on the simulator: (1) ability to place catheters in conventional recording/pacing sites (coronary sinus, His-bundle area, high right atrium, and right ventricular apex); (2) amount of help provided by the supervisor (scale from 1-3; 3 for maximal help); (3) fluoroscopy time; and (4) positioning time. Result(s): Seven fellows performed 168 catheter placements during 42 patient-based procedures with no complications. Comparing parameters before and after simulator training, there was a significant reduction in the mean amount of help and in fluoroscopy and positioning times per placement: from 1.71 +/- 1.24 to 0.42 +/- 0.68 (P <.001), from 121 +/- 88 seconds to 76 +/- 54 seconds (P <.001), and from 175 +/- 138 seconds to 102 +/- 74 seconds (P <.001), respectively. Overall fluoroscopy time per patient decreased from 567 +/- 220 seconds to 305 +/- 111 seconds (P <.0001). Improvement appeared to be related to simulator training alone and not to the previously performed patient-based procedures. Conclusion(s): During the early phase of the trainees' learning curve, simulator training significantly improves the independent trainees' performance with reduction in radiation exposure. © 2012 Heart Rhythm Society.

801,"Impaired permeability in radiation-induced lung injury detected by technetium-99m-DTPA lung clearance UNLABELLED: This study evaluates the use of the 99mTc-DTPA aerosol lung clearance method to investigate radiation-induced lung changes in eight patients undergoing radiotherapy for lung or breast carcinoma. The sensitivity of the method was compared with chest radiography for detecting radiation-induced changes in the lung, regional alterations within (irradiated region) and outside (shielded region) the treatment ports, effect of irradiated lung volume, and dependence on time after radiotherapy., METHODS: Serial DTPA lung clearance studies were performed before the first radiation treatment (baseline), then weekly during a 5- to 7-wk course, and up to 12 times post-therapy over periods of 56-574 days. The total activity deposited in the lungs for each study was approximately 150 microCi (approximately 5.6 MBq). DTPA clearance, expressed in terms of the biological half-time, t 1/2, was computed from the slopes of the least-squares fit regression lines of the time-activity curves for the first 10 min for irradiated and shielded lung regions., RESULTS: Major findings include: (a) significant and early DTPA t 1/2 changes were observed in all patients during and after radiotherapy; (b) changes in DTPA t 1/2 values were observed in both irradiated and shielded lung regions in all patients suggesting a radiation-induced systemic reaction; (c) changes in DTPA t 1/2 values were correlated (p < 0.05) with the irradiated lung volumes; (d) significantly reduced DTPA t 1/2 values were observed in three patients who subsequently presented with clinical symptoms and/or radiographic changes consistent with radiation pneumonitis (t1/2 felt to 19% +/- 6% of baseline values, compared with 64% +/- 17% in the remaining patients [p < 0.01]); (e) the onset of decreased DTPA t 1/2 values in these three patients occurred 35-84 days before clinical symptoms and/or radiographic changes; and (f) DTPA t 1/2 tended to approach baseline values with time after radiotherapy, suggesting a long-term recovery in lung injury., CONCLUSION: These observations show significant and early alterations in DTPA lung clearance during and after radiotherapy that may provide a sensitive assay to monitor changes in radiation-induced lung injury and may facilitate early therapeutic intervention.",Included
1096,"Functional changes cardiovascular: normobaric activity and microgravity in young healthy human subjects BACKGROUND: The cardiovascular system works to maintain homeostasis through a series of adaptive responses to physiological requirements. Different self-regulatory mechanism prevent the effects induced by hydrostatic pressure changes on oncotic pressure caused by postural changes. Gravity exerts a strong influence on the postural changes with implications on the cardiovascular system. In orbit, gravity (+Gz) is responsible of mass redistribution of circulating blood flow. The aim of this study was the evaluation of the adaptive responses of cardiovascular system to postural changes with and without the use of the Lower Body Negative Pressure (LBNP). We considered that pressure changes that occur in human body in orbit can be simulated experimentally with use of Tilt-Test (Clino/ortho; Clino/head-down; head-down/ortho). This investigation could be useful for studying the influence on astronauts of long flights., SUBJECTS AND METHODS: We studied in 12 months, 30 young healthy volunteers (20 males, 10 female) during postural change tests. In the first evaluation they were submitted to tilt-test for 40 minutes, remaining in head-up +60 degrees (this state corresponds to a kind of gravitational stress +Gz) and in head-down to -30 degrees (-Gz) for 20 minutes. During the second assessment (after 5 +/- 1 days) all volunteers wear a device that simulate a state of LBNP at -20 mmHg. Afterwards, they were processed to 20 minutes in Head Down -8 degrees and after 2 hours of rest to 20 minutes at -15 degrees. Volunteers were monitored measuring blood pressure, heart rate and by Transthoracic Echocardiogram (TTE)., RESULTS: Collected data were elaborated by a statistical analysis. We observed during orthostatic position for 40 min (+60 degrees) without LBNP, lower diameters and volumes of left and right ventricular (p < 0.05) and an increase in heart rate in comparison with the baseline conditions in clinostatism. Despite the reduction of preload volume, the mean value of cardiac output does not vary significantly. In Trendelemburg (-15 degrees) data show a non-significant variation (p > 0.05) of left and right ventricular diameters and volumes, while cardiac output and systolic blood pressure varies significantly (p < 0.05) compared to clinostatic and orthostatic position. With LBNP in head down to -8 degrees and -15 degrees, systolic and diastolic arterial pressure, ventricular volumes and cardiac output were unchanged if compared to values obtained in clinostatism with and without LBNP. If compared to -30 degrees in Trendelemburg without LBNP, data reached statistical significance (p < 0.05)., CONCLUSIONS: The cardiovascular system and the autonomic nervous system, respond to postural changes and to volemia alterations, maintaining the physiological cardiac output, in order to preserve the metabolic requirements of body.",Excluded
95,"Yield of a novel ultra-low-dose computed tomography device mounted on a dedicated cardiac SPECT system in improving the accuracy of myocardial perfusion imaging and the detection of chest abnormalities Background. To examine the yield of an ultra-low-dose computed tomography (CT) transmission module for attenuation-correction (AC) on a dedicated cardiac camera in evaluation of SPECT-myocardial perfusion imaging (MPI) in the diagnosis of CAD and for additional chest abnormalities. Methods. The study group included 150 patients with known or suspected CAD referred for technetium sestamibi SPECT MPI. CT transmission scanning (effective radiation 0.17 mSv) was performed after each gated SPECT scan. AC and non-corrected (NC) SPECT scans were evaluated on a 5-point scale using a 17-segment model, and the sum stress score (SSS) and sum rest score (SRS) were calculated for each condition. Overall image quality, sensitivity and normalcy rate (51 patients) and processing of 28 CT slices were screened for chest findings. Results. CT-based AC significantly improved image quality (P = .01). Mean SSS was 3.8 +/- 5.8 with AC and 6.1 +/- 7.1 with NC (P < .001); the respective SRS values were 2.6 +/- 6.3 and 3.9 +/- 7.7 (P < .001). The sensitivity of detecting >=70% stenosis was 71% and 86% (P = NS) and the normalcy rate was 30% and 89% (P < .0001) in NC and AC SPECT MPI, respectively. Chest CT: Lung abnormalities in 31%, aortic calcifications in 27%, and hiatus hernia in 5%. Conclusions. Ultra-low-dose CT for AC of SPECT-MPI improves image quality, diagnostic accuracy and suggests detection of chest findings. Copyright © 2011 American Society of Nuclear Cardiology.",Excluded
662,"Evidence that ferritin is UV inducible in human skin: part of a putative defense mechanism As ferritin has been identified as an important factor in antioxidant defense in cultured human skin cells we evaluated the presence of ferritin in human skin in vivo and the modifications following irradiation with UVA I, UVA I + II, and solar simulating light by immunohistochemical analysis. We report that the putative protective protein ferritin is regularly present in the basal layer of unirradiated epidermis in vivo and that the induction of ferritin was dependent on wavelength and cell type. Following UVA I radiation, ferritin increased both in epidermal and in dermal tissue. The same response occurred, although to a lesser extent, with UVA I + II but did not occur following solar simulating radiation. Quantitative analysis for ferritin in cultured keratinocytes and fibroblasts from seven individuals following each UV spectra were also assessed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The induction of ferritin by UV was highly dependent on the waveband and cell type. UVA I and UVA I + II radiations induced ferritin expression in dermal fibroblasts up to 260% and 200% over basal levels, respectively. Solar simulating radiation produced only a small induction of approximately 130% over basal ferritin levels in dermal fibroblasts. Ferritin increased in cultured fibroblasts as early as 3 h post-UVA with a peak at 6 h that remained until 48 h; there was no observable qualitative or quantitative increase seen in the undifferentiated cultured epidermal keratinocytes. Our findings indicate that the putative defense system of ferritin exists in human skin in vivo and its induction is dependent on UV spectra and cell type. The increased concentrations of this antioxidant in human skin following acute UV radiation could afford increased protection against subsequent oxidative stress.",Excluded

The frequency of maturation of the treated AJRs was about 27% and the best mating combination was a female ACJ and male AJR. The treatment of AJRs, made the progeny test for the selection of ACJs for breeding pairs of ACJ X ACR unnecessary and increased the frequency of appearance of AJRs to 50%.",Excluded
701,"First clinical tests using a liquid-filled electronic portal imaging device and a convolution model for the verification of the midplane dose BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Recently, algorithms have been developed to derive the patient dose from portal dose measurements using a liquid-filled electronic portal imaging device. These algorithms have already been validated for several phantom geometries irradiated under clinical conditions. It is the aim of the present study to investigate the applicability of a liquid-filled electronic portal imaging device in combination with these algorithms for two-dimensional midplane dose verification in clinical practice., MEASUREMENTS AND METHODS: Portal dose images were obtained during several patient treatments under routine clinical conditions. Measurements were performed to verify the midplane dose during radiotherapy of larynx cancer with 4 MV beams, breast and lung cancer with 8 MV beams and prostate cancer with both 8 and 18 MV beams. Midplane doses, determined from portal dose measurements and analyzed with our algorithms, were compared with midplane doses calculated with our three-dimensional (3D) treatment planning system (TPS)., RESULTS: For the larynx treatment the measured 2D midplane dose agreed within 2.0% with TPS calculations in most parts of the field. Larger differences were found in a small region below the skin due to the absence of electron equilibrium, which is not taken into account in our portal dose analysis. For breast irradiations the measured midplane dose showed a homogeneous distribution in the AP direction in the axial plane, while high dose regions were observed in the cranial and caudal part of the breast. Portal dose measurements and TPS calculations agreed within 2.5% for most of the prostate and lung irradiations. For a few of the prostate and lung treatments larger local differences were found due to differences between the actual patient anatomy and the planning CT data, e.g. as a result of variable gas filling in the rectum and anatomical changes in the lung., CONCLUSIONS: Portal dose measurements with a liquid-filled electronic portal imaging device can be used to determine the 2D midplane dose for various treatment sites in clinical practice. Portal in vivo dosimetry has proven to be important in detecting changes in the patient's anatomy and its influence on the dose delivery. It is concluded that portal dosimetry is an excellent tool for accurate and independent verification of the dose in the entire (2D) midplane during patient treatment. However, a limited number of patients were involved in this study and the results are therefore preliminary. More research is needed to fully assess the clinical value of portal dose measurements.",Excluded
486,"Classification of benign and malignant breast lesions in ultrasound images using support vector machines One of the most common diseases prevalent among women is Breast cancer. In general, Mammography is applied for the detection of the breast cancer, whereas, the technique of Mammography makes use of the ionizing radiation. As a result, this technique does not detect the breast cancer in women having dense breast. In the beginning phases of malignancy, radiologist could experience the challenges in identifying the lesions. Hence, there is a need for one more screen test for the confirmation of the cancer. On the other hand, Sonography is also commonly used for the detection and classification of abnormalities of the breast owing to its cost-effectiveness, comfort level of patient, and non-ionizing radiation. Nevertheless, ultrasound images seem to be low contrast images as well as the physician could encounter the possible challenges in the identification of the lesions. Therefore, there has been an inevitable requirement in the development of Computer Aided Diagnosis (CAD) system for the purpose of classifying breast lesion in an accurate manner. This paper aims at the analyzing the Morphological and Fractal features in an effective manner for differentiating benign as well as malignant masses from ultrasound images.

Two experienced observers independently evaluated coronary CTA datasets from 50 consecutive patients undergoing two 128-slice dual source CT scans within 12 days. Mean (+/-SD) estimated radiation exposure was 1.5 +/- 0.2 mSv per scan. Observers recorded the presence and characterization of coronary plaques as non-calcified or calcified. A segment involvement score"" (SIS) was computed by summing the numbers of segments with any coronary plaque per patient. Reproducibility was assessed using kappa (kappa) statistics, paired t test and Bland-Altman analyses. Interscan, interobserver, and intraobserver agreement (kappa-values) for detection of any or calcified plaques were 83-94% (kappa-values 0.57-0.85), and 67-84% (0.31-0.67) for non-calcified plaques on a patient level.

606,"Dosimetry and toxicity of Quadramet for bone marrow ablation in multiple myeloma and other haematological malignancies Standard treatment regimens for haematological malignancies include myeloablative chemoradiotherapy and subsequent rescue by stem cell transplantation. However, these treatment regimens have significant associated mortality and morbidity, and disease recurrence remains a problem. One alternative approach is the targeted delivery of radiotherapy to the marrow using a bone-seeking agent labelled with an appropriate radioisotope, with the aim of delivering a potentially ablative radiation dose to marrow while minimising non-haematological toxicity. Pharmacokinetics and radiation dosimetry for a commercial preparation of samarium-153 ethylene diamine tetramethylene phosphonate (EDTMP; Quadramet) were evaluated in 43 tracer (average dose 740 MBq) studies of 42 patients with haematological malignancies. Measurements of 24-h retention were also available following infusion of 18-48 GBq in 15 patients. Quadramet cleared rapidly from the tissue, with a median biological half-life of 1.4 h. Activity taken up by the skeleton was firmly bound, with activity decreasing according to physical half-life at 24 h in 29 of the 43 cases. The percentage activity retained in the skeleton at 24 h with tracer doses was high (62%+/-13%), although this decreased to approximately 30% with therapy infusions. Because of this decrease in retention, the maximum feasible therapy activity for this formulation of Quadramet is 35 GBq. Median absorbed marrow radiation dose was 0.78 Gy/GBq in tracer studies: the decreased retention at high activities means that this corresponds to a median dose of 12 Gy for 35 GBq administered activity. It is possible to use 24-h retention as a rough guide to marrow dose in individual patients. In tracer studies, median bladder radiation dose was 0.22 Gy/GBq and radiation dose to the liver was very conservatively estimated at 0.2 Gy/GBq. After therapy infusions of up to 50 GBq in 37 patients, non-haematopoietic toxicity was not seen in any patient. In addition, myelosuppression was achieved without evidence of myelofibrosis. The residual dose rate to marrow fell to a level acceptable for stem cell re-infusion by 2 weeks after administration.",Excluded
1034,"CT-guided navigation of percutaneous hepatic and renal radiofrequency ablation under high-frequency jet ventilation: feasibility study PURPOSE: Computed tomography (CT)-guided navigation during percutaneous radiofrequency (RF) ablations of liver and kidney lesions is hampered by respiratory motion and time-dependent lesion conspicuity after contrast agent injection. Therefore, target immobilization by general anesthesia with high-frequency jet ventilation (HFJV) instead of conventional ventilation (CV) with repeated breath-holds may facilitate and speed up navigation of RF ablation probes., MATERIALS AND METHODS: Nineteen consecutive patients who underwent percutaneous RF ablation of liver (n = 9) or renal tumors (n = 10) with CT guidance under HFJV (n = 9) or CV (n = 10) were included. The choice of the anesthesiologic technique was left to the discretion of the interventionalist. Complexity of the intervention (ie, number of lesions ablated per session, conspicuity of the lesion on nonenhanced CT, and access pathway), volume of the ablated tissue, radiation exposure, and complications were compared between the HFJV and CV groups., RESULTS: In this feasibility study, a statistically significant radiation dose reduction (P < .05) was noted in the HFJV group compared with the CV group for liver and renal RF ablation. No complications were observed in the HFJV group, whereas renal subcapsular hematoma (n = 2) and pulmonary embolism (n = 1) occurred in the CV group., CONCLUSIONS: Percutaneous CT-guided navigation of RF ablation probes under HFJV is feasible and safe. It might be advantageous for the treatment of complex kidney and liver tumors, allowing less irradiation exposure to the patient and the interventional radiologist. Copyright © 2011 SIR.

975,"Long-term in vitro and in vivo effects of gamma-irradiated BCG on innate and adaptive immunity BCG vaccination is associated with a reduced mortality from nonmycobacterial infections. This is likely to be mediated by a combination of innate-immune memory (trained immunity"") and heterologous effects on adaptive immunity. As such, BCG could be used to boost host immunity but not in immunocompromised hosts, as it is a live, attenuated vaccine. Therefore, we assessed whether killed gammaBCG has similar potentiating effects. In an in vitro model of trained immunity, human monocytes were incubated with gammaBCG for 24 h and restimulated after 6 d. Cytokine production and the role of pattern recognition receptors and histone methylation markers were assessed. The in vivo effects of gammaBCG vaccination were studied in a proof-of-principle trial in 15 healthy volunteers. gammaBCG induced trained immunity in vitro via the NOD2 receptor pathway and up-regulation of H3K4me3 histone methylation. However, these effects were less strong than those induced by live BCG. gammaBCG vaccination in volunteers had only minimal effects on innate immunity, whereas a significant increase in heterologous Th1/Th17 immunity was observed. Our results indicate that gammaBCG induces long-term training of innate immunity in vitro. In vivo, gammaBCG induces mainly heterologous effects on the adaptive-immune system, whereas effects on innate cytokine production are limited. Copyright © Society for Leukocyte Biology.""",Excluded

Therefore, the liver's regenerating capacity is of vital importance. Multiple pathways are activated in the complex process that leads to hepatic regeneration. In the present study, we aimed to evaluate the effect of proton pump inhibitors omeprozole, lansoprazole, and pantoprazole on hepatic regeneration following partial hepatectomy., MATERIALS AND METHODS: Four groups were formed with 32 rats in each. Partial liver resections were performed for all animals. Omeprazole (71.4 microg/day), lansoprazole (107 microg/day), pantoprazole (143 microg/day) and placebo (0.5 cm(3)) were administered to the groups respectively. A quarter of the rats in each group were sacrificed on the 1st postoperative day. The rest were sacrificed on the 3rd, 5th and 7th postoperative days. The remnant regenerating liver mass was removed and weighed, and Ki-67 monoclonal antibody levels were measured., RESULTS: There was no statistical difference between the four groups on the first day in evaluating the weight of the liver mass (p = 0.09) and Ki-67 (p = 0.268) levels.

474,"Functional MR urography for assessment of obstructive and reflux uropathies Purpose - Objective. In congenital anomalies of the kidney and urinary tract (CAKUT) the role of MRI for classification is expanded by obtaining functional data. MAG3 scintigraphy is considered gold standard for functional analysis. Material and methods. From 04/2010 to 01/2012 20 patients from one university hospital were examined by a standardised MR urography (MRU) in a 1.5 Tesla scanner after i.v. hydration and furosemide i.v. The data was processed by a dedicated software (CHOP-fMRU). Results were compared with Tc99m MAG3 scintigraphy. Results. Twenty patients (5 female, 15 male; age 5 weeks to 18.4 years) had both MR urography and MAG3 scintigraphy (1 to 484; average 48 days). All patients had isolated or combined CAKUT (6 duplex kidneys; 7 proximal, 11 distal ureteral stenoses; 8 subvesical obstructions; 10 VUR). Split renal function values differed by an average 8.2 % (min 1 %, max 18 %). Curve types after O' Reilly were available in 36 kidneys (4 kidneys were multicystic dysplastic with no residual organ function). There was a relevant discrepancy in one case only (norml in scintigraphy, relevant obstruction in MRU). Discussion and conclusions. X-ray excretion urography was replaced by earlier MRU. The CHOP-fMRU examination protocol is very robust and reliable and able to give as much information as MAG3 scintigraphy.

251,"A novel process for introducing a new intraoperative program: a multidisciplinary paradigm for mitigating hazards and improving patient safety BACKGROUND: Since the Institute of Medicine's report, To Err is Human, was published, numerous interventions have been designed and implemented to correct the defects that lead to medical errors and adverse events; however, most efforts were largely reactive. Safety, communication, team performance, and efficiency are areas of care that attract a great deal of attention, especially regarding the introduction of new technologies, techniques, and procedures. We describe a multidisciplinary process that was implemented at our hospital to identify and mitigate hazards before the introduction of a new technique: high-dose-rate intraoperative radiation therapy, (HDR-IORT)., METHODS: A multidisciplinary team of surgeons, anesthesiologists, radiation oncologists, physicists, nurses, hospital risk managers, and equipment specialists used a structured process that included in situ clinical simulation to uncover concerns among care providers and to prospectively identify and mitigate defects for patients who would undergo surgery using the HDR-IORT technique., RESULTS: We identified and corrected 20 defects in the simulated patient care process before application to actual patients. Subsequently, eight patients underwent surgery using the HDR-IORT technique with no recurrence of simulation-identified or unanticipated defects., CONCLUSION: Multiple benefits were derived from the use of this systematic process to introduce the HDR-IORT technique; namely, the safety and efficiency of care for this select patient population was optimized, and this process mitigated harmful or adverse events before the inclusion of actual patients. Further work is needed, but the process outlined in this paper can be universally applied to the introduction of any new technologies, treatments, or procedures.",Excluded
547,"Elbowarthroplasty in complex osteoporotic fractures Objective: Osteoporotic elbow fractures (EF) represent a challenge. Open reduction and internal fixation is hard to achieve due to poor mechanical bone proprieties, for this reason elbow arthroplasty (EA) is increasingly popularity in case of comminuted fractures of the distal humerus and is associated with a rapid recovery of elbow motion. The aim of this study is to evaluate clinical outcomes of our series. Material(s) and Method(s): From September 2007 to March 2013 we performed 30 EA in 29 patients; 25 females and 4 males. All patients had poor bone quality with a distal humeral fracture or a complex EF or a terrible triad of the elbow. The surgical approach used was a universal posterior incision with triceps preservation. At each follow-up we performed x-rays of the elbow and a clinical evaluation with the Mayo Elbow Performance Score. Result(s): Mean age was 72 years (range 45-94); we reported an isolated distal humeral fracture in 15 cases; a complex EF in 10 and a terrible triad of the elbow in 5. In 2 cases was necessary using a homologous bone graft. In 28 cases a total EA (18 Coonrad-Morrey TEA Zimmer; and 10 Latitude TEA Toriner); one patient received an hemiarthroplasty (Latitude humeral component) and in another case a custom-made prosthesis was implanted (LINK). In 2 cases a supplementary osteosynthesis was performed. Good to excellent functional results were reported in 24 cases (80 %) and only in 6 cases fair and poor results were recorded:3 traumatic periprosthetic fractures, one prosthesis loosening due to an insufficient stem cementation and 2 superficial infections treated with antibiotics. Despite poor biomechanical properties of the osteoporotic bone in elderly patients, our results seem to be slight superior to than reported in literature, this can be probably attributed to the surgical approach that preserves both the olecranon and the triceps extensor mechanism. Conclusion(s): In case of complex osteoporotic EF we prefer use EA with a triceps preserving approach.",Excluded
345,"Recovery kinetics in mouse skin and CaNT tumours Recovery kinetics and recovery capacity were studied in a fast proliferating normal tissue, skin, and in an anaplastic mouse mammary carcinoma, CaNT. Three fractions per day of X-rays, repeated over 5 days, were given at varying interfraction intervals from 0 to 8 h. The rate of recovery in tumours (t1/2 = 0.31 +/- 0.15 h for local control) was significantly faster than in skin (t1/2 = 0.96 +/- 0.10 h). By contrast, the fractionation sensitivity of CaNT tumours was less than that of skin (alpha/beta = 43.3 +/- 8.5 Gy vs. alpha/beta = 7.9 +/- 0.2 Gy). Tissues with recovery half-times similar to or longer than that determined for skin would be at risk if interfraction intervals less than 6 h are used in regimes which involve the use of two or more fractions per day. This would be especially true for tissues that show a greater sensitivity to dose fractionation, and hence more sparing of radiation damage with hyperfractionation.",Excluded
458,"Assessment of internal exposure doses in Fukushima by a whole body counter within one month after the nuclear power plant accident Information on early internal radiation doses in Fukushima after the nuclear power plant accident on March 11, 2011, is quite limited due to initial organizational difficulties, high background radiation and contamination of radiation measuring devices. In Nagasaki, approximately 1,200 km away from Fukushima, the internal radioactivity in evacuees and short-term visitors to Fukushima has been measured by a whole body counter (WBC) since March 15, 2011. A horizontal bed-type scanning WBC equipped with two NaI(Tl) scintillation detectors was used for 173 people who stayed in the Fukushima prefecture between March 11 and April 10, 2011. The average length of stay was 4.8 days. The internal radioactivity was converted to an estimated amount of intake according to the scenario of acute inhalation, and then the committed effective dose and the thyroid dose were evaluated. 131I, 134Cs and 137Cs were detected in more than 30% of examined individuals. In subjects who stayed in Fukushima from March 12 to March 18, the detection rate was approximately 50% higher for each radionuclide and 44% higher for all three nuclides. The maximum committed effective dose and thyroid equivalent dose were 1 mSv and 20 mSv, respectively. Although the number of subjects and settlements in the study are limited, the results suggest that the internal radiation exposure in Fukushima due to the intake of radioactive materials shortly after the accident will probably not result in any deterministic or stochastic health effects. © 2013 by Radiation Research Society.",Excluded
604,"Intravascular radiation therapy after balloon angioplasty of narrowed femoropopliteal arteries to prevent restenosis: results of the PARIS feasibility clinical trial PURPOSE: To conduct a feasibility study to assess the feasibility, safety, and outcome of endoluminal gamma radiation therapy after balloon angioplasty of superficial femoral artery (SFA) lesions., MATERIALS AND METHODS: Forty patients with claudication were enrolled in the study and underwent percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA) of SFA lesions with a mean lesion length of 9.8 cm +/- 3.0 and a mean reference vessel diameter of 5.2 mm +/- 3.1. After successful PTA, a segmented centering balloon catheter was positioned to cover the PTA site. The patients were then transported to the radiation oncology suite and treated with a microSelectron HDR afterloader with use of an Ir-192 source with a prescribed dose of 14 Gy, 2 mm into the vessel wall. Ankle-brachial index (ABI) and Rutherford score were evaluated at 1, 6, and 12 months after the procedure and angiographic follow-up was conducted at 6 months., RESULTS: Radiation was delivered successfully to 35 of 40 patients. There were no procedural complications. Exercise and rest ABI were higher at 1 year (0.72 +/- 0.26 and 0.89 +/- 0.18, respectively) compared to baseline (0.51 +/- 0.25 and 0.67 +/- 0.17, respectively). Maximum walking time on a treadmill increased from 3.41 min +/- 2.41 to 4.43 min +/- 2.49 at 30 days and was 4.04 min +/- 2.8 at 12 months. The angiographic binary restenosis rate at 6 months was 17.2% and the clinical restenosis rate at 12 months was 13.3%. There were no angiographic or clinical adverse events related to the radiation therapy., CONCLUSIONS: Intraarterial radiation after PTA of SFA lesions with use of high-dose rate gamma radiation is feasible and safe. The angiographic and clinical improvements are sustainable at 1 year and represent a potent antirestenotic therapy for the treatment of narrowed peripheral arteries.",Excluded

In addition, five males and five females were treated in a similar fashion, but were exposed to sham conditions. For each subject, a blood sample was obtained prior to the exposure period and aliquots were used as negative- (pre-exposure) and positive- [1.5 Gray (Gy) (60)Cobalt ((60)Co) gamma-irradiation] controls. At the end of the 4 h exposure period, a second blood sample was obtained. The extent of DNA damage was assessed in peripheral human blood leukocytes from all samples using the alkaline comet assay. To detect possible clastogenic effects, the incidence of micronuclei was assessed in phytohemagglutinin (PHA)-stimulated lymphocytes using the cytokinesis-block micronucleus assay., RESULTS: There was no evidence of either increased DNA damage, as indicated by the alkaline comet assay, or increased incidence of micronuclei (MN) in the magnetic field exposed group. However, an in vitro exposure of 1.5 Gy gamma-irradiation caused a significant increase in both DNA damage and MN induction., CONCLUSIONS: This study found no evidence that an acute, whole-body exposure to a 200 microT, 60 Hz magnetic field for 4 hours could cause DNA damage in human blood.",Excluded
961,"Unipedicular versus bipedicular percutaneous vertebroplasty for osteoporotic vertebral compression fractures: A prospective randomized study Background: Percutaneous vertebroplasty (PVP) typically involves conventional lower-viscosity cement injection via bipedicular approach. Limited evidence is available comparing the clinical outcomes and complications in treating osteoporotic vertebral compression fractures (OVCFs) with PVP using high-viscosity cement through unipedicular or bipedicular approach. Methods and design: Fifty patients with OVCFs were randomly allocated into two groups adopting unipedicular or bipedicular PVP. The efficacy of unipedicular and bipedicular PVP was assessed by comparing operation time, X-ray exposure time, incidence of complications, vertebral height restoration, and improvement of the visual analogue scale (VAS), Oswestry disability index (ODI) and Short Form-36 (SF-36) General Health Survey scores. Result(s): The mean operative and exposure time to X-rays in the unipedicular PVP group was less than that of the bipedicular group (p < 0.05). No statistically significant differences were observed in the VAS score, ODI score, SF-36 score, cement leakage rate or vertebral height restoration between the two groups (p > 0.05). Conclusion(s): Unipedicular and bipedicular PVP are safe and effective treatments for OVCF. Compared with bipedicular PVP, unipedicular PVP entails a shorter surgical time and lower X-ray irradiation.Copyright © 2015 Zhang et al.",Excluded
1046,"The impact of different computational assumptions in 131I dosimetry for hyperthyroidism therapy Purpose: The goal of the current study was to investigate the impact of different computational models on 131I dosimetry prior to hyperthyroidism therapy. It was also aimed to highlight an accurate and cost-effective method for routine dosimetry of graves and toxic adenoma patients. Method(s): A cohort of 45 patients was recruited in the current study with Graves (n = 30) and Toxic Adenoma (n = 15) diseases. The eligibility criterion was determined using the patients' blood test, 99mTc- pertechnetate scintigraphy, and ultrasound scan. A properly calibrated thyroid probe equipped with sodium iodide crystal [NaI(Tl)] was used to obtain the uptake measurements at 2, 24, 48, 72, and 96 h following administration of 0.27-0.73 MBq 131I tracer. The absorbed radiation dose of the thyroid gland/nodule was calculated by three different methods. The calculation models were based on the time-integrated activity (recommended by MIRD), effective half-life (recommended by EANM), and ellipsoidal-shape assumption. Result(s): The mean effective half-life was 138 +/- 41 h and 110 +/- 48 h in Graves and Toxic Adenoma patients, respectively. The mean residence time was 125 +/- 5 h in Graves patients, while it was 93 +/- 55 h in Toxic Adenoma. The amount of 131I activity required to deliver 200 Gy to the thyroid gland in Graves patients was calculated as 436 +/- 381 MBq, 426 +/- 370 MBq, and 488 +/- 455 MBq according to MIRD, EANM, and ellipsoidal-shape model, respectively. However, the activity required to impart 300 Gy in the toxic nodules was computed as 622 +/- 332 MBq by MIRD, 907 +/- 588 MBq by EANM, and 1060 +/- 639 MBq by the ellipsoidal-shape model. Overall, no significant difference was found between the MIRD and both of the EANM and ellipsoidal-shape models in the Graves patients (R2 = 0.99, P > 0.05). In contrast, less agreement (R2 = 0.86) was shown between EANM and MIRD in Toxic Adenoma patients with no statistically significant difference (P > 0.05), while the difference was significant (Pvalue < 0.05) between the MIRD and the ellipsoidal-shape model with moderate association (R2 = 0.66). Conclusion(s): It was deduced that the effective half-life-based model (EANM model) is a successful and affordable method for performing dosimetry in Graves patients. While, unit density sphere model sounds the most appropriate approach to be used in Toxic Adenoma dosimetry. However, using the ellipsoidal-shape assumption in the thyroid gland/or nodule dose calculation leads to redundantly larger activity administration.Copyright © 2020 American Association of Physicists in Medicine",Excluded
911,"Impact of induction concurrent chemoradiotherapy on pulmonary function and postoperative acute respiratory complications in esophageal cancer Study objective: To evaluate the effects of induction concurrent chemoradiotherapy (cCRT) on pulmonary function and postoperative acute respiratory complications (PARCs). Design(s): A retrospective review of our patients treated with induction cCRT to determine the impact on pulmonary function and identify predictors of PARCs. Correlations were sought between patient demographics, clinical characteristics, pre-cCRT and post-cCRT pulmonary function, radiotherapy dose, chemotherapy agents, and the development of PARCs. Participant(s): One hundred fifty-five patients treated in three separate clinical trials were identified; 47 patients received 30 Gy (150 cGy bid) of radiation concurrently with a single course of cisplatin/5-fluorouracil (5FU), and 108 patients received 45 Gy (150 cGy bid in a split course) concurrent with two courses of either cisplatin/5FU (n = 69) or cisplatin/paclitaxel (n = 39). Esophagectomy was performed in 141 of these 155 patients following cCRT. Result(s): cCRT was only associated with significant worsening of the diffusion capacity of the lung for carbon monoxide (DLCO), which decreased a median of 21.7% in the 45-Gy group (p = 0.007), and 8.6% in the 30-Gy group (p = 0.07). This DLCO decrease was statistically greater in the 45-Gy group than in the 30-Gy group (p = 0.02). PARCs developed in 18 patients. Percentage of predicted FEV1 and FVC, both before and after cCRT, were both significantly higher in patients without PARCs than in patients with PARCs (p = 0.031 and p = 0.010, respectively). Post-cCRT DLCO was also significantly worse in patients with PARCs (p = 0.002). PARCs occurred significantly more often among those treated with 45 Gy (17 of 102 patients) compared to those treated with 30 Gy (1 of 39 patients) [p = 0.025]. In the 18 patients with PARCs, the median survival was only 2.1 months. This was significantly less than the 16.4-month median survival in the 123 patients who did not have PARCs (p = 0.001). Conclusion(s): In patients treated with induction cCRT, higher radiation doses result in increasing impairment of gas exchange. PARCs were more likely in those patients with lower lung volumes, lower post-cCRT DLCO, and in those receiving higher radiation doses. These acute respiratory complications were also associated with a significant reduction in patient survival.",Excluded
284,"Comparison of simulator-CT versus simulator fluoroscopy versus surface marking based radiation treatment planning: a prospective study by three-dimensional evaluation BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Field placement for Radiation Treatment Planning can be done based on the surface markings or simulator fluoroscopy or simulator with CT facilities. A prospective study was carried out to compare these three techniques of radiation treatment planning to quantitatively find out the difference in normal tissue dosages and target volume coverage in the three groups after three-dimensional evaluation., PATIENTS AND METHODS: The CT scans of 30 patients in the treatment position, taken on a Shimadzu SCT-3000 TF scanner at 1cm intervals, were transferred to Theraplan-500 three-dimensional radiation treatment planning computer. The normal tissues and target volumes (GTV and CTV) were outlined on all the CT slices as per (ICRU) Report no. 50. Three types of radiation treatment planning was done sequentially: Plan I-based on the surface markings alone, Plan II-based on simulator-fluoroscopy, and Plan III-based on Simulator-CT., RESULTS: The mean dose to 95% of the clinical target volume (D95) was increased by 4.4 and 6.4% by Plans II and III as compared with Plan I. The mean dose to 3/3rd (D(3/3)) to all the critical organs was decreased by 6.6 and 8.4% by Plans II and III as compared to Plan I. The mean time, in simulator room, for field placement for Plans I-III was 6.2, 14.6 and 44 min, respectively., CONCLUSIONS: Thus for adequate coverage of target volumes and sparing normal tissues, Simulator-CT based radiation treatment planning is the best method of radiation treatment planning though it is more time consuming.",Excluded
120,"Individualizing cancer treatment: biological optimization models in treatment planning and delivery PURPOSE: During the last 30 years radiation therapy has developed from classical rectangular beams via conformation therapy with largely uniform dose delivery, but irregular field shapes, to fully intensity modulated dose delivery where the total dose distribution in the tumor can be fully controlled in three dimensions. This last step has been developed during the last 15-20 years and has opened up the possibilities for truly optimized radiation therapy., METHODS AND MATERIALS: Today it is not only possible to produce almost any desired dose distribution in the tumor volume. It is also possible to deliver the dose distribution, which has the highest probability to cure the patient without inducing severe complications in normal tissues. To fully exploit the advantages of intensity-modulated radiation therapy, quality of life or radiobiologic objectives have to be used, preferably combined with predictive assay of radiation sensitivity., RESULTS: This article will briefly discuss the biologic objective functions and the associated advantages in the treatment outcome using new approaches such as consideration of stochastic variations in sensitivity and optimization of the angle of incidence and fractionation schedule with intensity-modulated beams. Finally, different possibilities for realizing general three-dimensional intensity-modulated dose delivery will be discussed., CONCLUSIONS: Once accurate genetically and/or cell survival based predictive assays become available, radiation therapy will become an exact science allowing truly individual optimization considering also the panorama of side-effects that the patient is willing to accept.",Excluded

Postoperative radiation therapy (PORT) is frequently recommended to improve survival outcome. The effect of PORT-associated morbidity on patients' quality of life (QOL) is, however, not well established. This study assessed the effect of PORT on medium-term (ie, at 6 months) QOL in patients with oral cavity squamous cell carcinoma (SCC). Methods. Patients completed the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire Core 30 (EORTC QLQ-C30) and Quality of Life Questionnaire Core Head and Neck 35 (QLQ-HN35) at initial presentation, and at 3-, 6-, and 12-month follow-up. Baseline QOL scores were adjusted for using analysis of covariance (ANCOVA). Results. Global health status (mean difference = 13.3; p =.042) and xerostomia (mean difference = 35.4; p =.003) were significantly worse at 6 months in patients who received PORT compared to those treated with surgery alone. Conclusion. The survival advantage needs to be balanced against increased treatment toxicity. PORT is associated with reduced global health status, increased xerostomia, and marginally increased levels of fatigue at 6 months posttreatment for oral cavity cancer. © 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",Excluded

From 1994 to June 2013, 14 anaplastic meningiomas, 6 meningiomas with a rhabdoid component, and 5 meningiomas with papillary component were pathologically diagnosed. We analyzed magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) findings, extent of removal, adjuvant treatment, progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS), and pathologic features of 14 anaplastic meningiomas (group A), 5 meningiomas with a predominant (>=50%) papillary or rhabdoid component (group B1), and 6 meningiomas without a predominant (<50%) rhabdoid or papillary component (group B2). Homogeneous enhancement on MRI was associated with improved PFS compared to heterogeneous enhancement (p=0.025). Depending on pathology, the mean PFS was 134.9+/-31.6 months for group A, 46.6+/-13.4 months for group B1, and 118.7+/-19.2 months for group B2. The mean OS was 138.5+/-24.6 months for group A and 59.7+/-16.8 months for group B1. All recurrent tumors were of the previously diagnosed pathology, except for one tumor from group B1, which recurred as an atypical meningioma without a papillary component.

287,"Expanded Characterization of a Hemi-Body Shielded Gottingen Minipig Model of Radiation-induced Gastrointestinal Injury Incorporating Oral Dosing Procedures In collaboration with the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA), the authors recently conducted a pilot study in a hemi-body shielded model of radiation-induced gastrointestinal (GI) injury in Gottingen minipigs following exposure to radiation dose levels between 8-16 Gy. Herein, the impact of oral dosing procedures is assessed, as well as the specific causes of death in animals exposed to radiation doses of 14 and 16 Gy (n = 64; 32 male, 32 female, between 6 and 8 mo of age). Oral dosing using a 2-tablet placebo system comprised of both immediate release and enteric-coated tablets starting 24 h post-irradiation resulted in inhibited gastric emptying of the enteric-coated tablets, which were found to be retained in the stomach and/or regurgitated. This finding appears to be species-specific, as similar findings have not been reported for other large animal species (e.g., non-human primates). Mortality was primarily dictated by decreased activity, body weight loss (>35%), and/or respiratory distress, despite shielding of the lung. The cause of respiratory distress in animals that were pre-terminally euthanized varied according to the timing of death, with interstitial inflammation and extensive fibrosis observed >20 days post-irradiation. Kidney damage was also identified in most animals after day 10. Changes in the GI tract were consistent with previous studies and included collagen deposition/fibrosis. Observations of inflammatory infiltrates and interstitial inflammation/fibrosis in both shielded and unshielded organs support a strong secondary inflammatory syndrome post-irradiation.",Included

The paper presents the results of ultrasonic investigations of the heart, arterial and venous peripheral vessels in different parts of human body, and measurements of leg veins capacity with the use of occlusive plethysmograpy. It was shown that in the resting condition such prime hemodynamic parameters as the pumping function of the heart and blood supply of the brain, and integral parameters, i.e. arterial pressure and heat rate, were best protected"" as they demonstrated stability throughout long exposure in microgravity. In the absence of gravitational stimulation, arterial resistance went down in essentially all vascular regions below the heart level; to put it differently, the anti-gravity distribution of the vascular tone was annulled gradually as unneeded in microgravity. Compared with the data about arteries, venous hemodynamics was found to be particularly sensitive considering the early advent and significance of changes. Venous return slowed down, resistance of the lower body vessels declined and capacity of the leg venous net increased. Functional testing with the lower body negative pressure revealed degradation of the gravity-dependent reactions that became more conspicuous as flight duration extended further. Cardiovascular deconditioning showed itself clearly on return to Earth's gravity by decreased g-tolerance during re-entry and orthostatic instability post flight. These investigations provided objective evidence for multifactorial genesis of orthostatic instability during space flight including blood redistribution, altered tone regulation of leg's venous and arterial vessels and hypovolemia.""",Excluded

Between 2012 and 2014, 43 consecutive patients with thyroid cancer received low-dose RRA with rhTSH after total thyroidectomy. We retrospectively investigated the adverse events during low-dose RRA and during diagnostic whole body scan (DxWBS) using rhTSH, and analyzed the rate of RRA completion and the associations between RRA completion and various clinical/pathological factors. Complete RRA was seen in 33 (76.7%) patients, and incomplete RRA was observed in 10 (23.3%). Patients with incomplete RRA had stronger neck accumulation of 131I than those with complete RRA (P<0.001). Adverse events at RRA and DxWBS were seen in 12 and 9 patients, respectively. All events at RRA were grade 1, with one exception (grade 2 vertigo after rhTSH administration). The rate of adverse events at DxWBS was significantly higher in patients with adverse events seen at RRA (risk ratio, 3.778, P=0.008).

161,"Randomized phase II study of temozolomide and radiotherapy compared with radiotherapy alone in newly diagnosed glioblastoma multiforme Purpose: Surgery remains the standard treatment for glioma, followed by radiotherapy (RT) with or without chemotherapy. Despite multidisciplinary approaches, the median survival time for patients with glioblastoma multiform (GBM) remains at less than 1 year from initial diagnosis. Temozolomide (TMZ), an oral alkylating agent, has shown promising activity in the treatment of malignant gliomas. We conducted a multicenter randomized phase II study comparing the efficacy and safety of TMZ administered concomitantly and sequentially to RT versus RT alone in patients with newly diagnosed GBM. Patients and Methods: One hundred thirty patients with pathologically confirmed, newly diagnosed GBM were randomly assigned (110 assessable patients) to receive either TMZ 75 mg/m2/d orally, concomitantly with RT (60 Gy in 30 fractions; group A, n = 57), followed by six cycles of TMZ (150 mg/m2 on days 1 through 5 and 15 to 19 every 28 days), or RT alone (60 Gy in 30 fractions; group B, n = 53). Result(s): Median time to progression was 10.8 months in group A and 5.2 months in group B (P = .0001). One-year progression-free survival rate was 36.6% in group A and 7.7% in group B.

483,"Occupational risk factors and reproductive health of women BACKGROUND: This in-depth review summarizes and interprets the available recent epidemiologic evidence on the relationship between occupational exposures and negative reproductive outcome among women workers. METHODS: The studies examined by the review include those published in the international scientific literature since 1990, and were identified through the search of relevant data banks using selected keywords. RESULTS: From the examination of studies dealing with exposures of women to chemical agents, pesticides, physical agents, ergonomic factors and stress, it appears that at present the evidence is sufficient to warrant the maximum protection of pregnant women to several well-documented occupational risk factors. These include exposures to anaesthetic gases, antineoplastic drugs, heavy metals, solvents, heavy physical work and irregular work schedules. For other work risks, such as exposure to non-ionizing radiation and psychosocial work stress, the evidence is often suggestive but not conclusive. CONCLUSIONS: Policy makers and health professionals should advise women and employers to avoid exposure to the well-known occupational risk factors, while epidemiologic research should pursue methodological improvements and provide more insight into the magnitude of exposures responsible for detrimental effects.

1011,"Cetuximab plus cisplatin, irinotecan, and thoracic radiotherapy as definitive treatment for locally advanced, unresectable esophageal cancer: A phase-II study of the SWOG (S0414) Introduction: The specific aims of the study were to evaluate the 2-year overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS), toxicity profile, and best objective response rate in patients with locally advanced, clinically unresectable esophageal cancer receiving cetuximab, cisplatin, irinotecan, and thoracic radiotherapy (TRT) within a multi-institutional cooperative-group setting. Method(s): Eligible patients (cT4 M0 or medically unresectable, biopsy proven, and noncervical esophageal cancer) were to receive four 21-day cycles of cetuximab 400 mg/m2 (day 1, cycle 1), cetuximab 250 mg/m2 (day 8, 15, cycle 1; then days 1, 8, and 15 for subsequent cycles), cisplatin 30 mg/m2 (days 1 and 8, all cycles), and irinotecan 65 mg/m 2 (days 1 and 8, all cycles). TRT was administered at 1.8 Gy in 28 daily fractions to a total dose of 50.4 Gy, to begin with on day 1 of cycle 3. The primary endpoint was 2-year OS, with an accrual goal of 75 patients with adenocarcinoma. Result(s): The study was closed because of slow accrual, with 21 eligible patients (11 squamous, 10 adenocarcinoma) enrolled from May 2005 to September 2007. Two-year OS and PFS (95% confidence interval [CI]) were 33.3% (14.6-57.0%) and 23.8% (8.2-47.2%), respectively. Kaplan-Meier estimates of median (95% CI) OS and PFS were 11.2 (6.4-43.6) and 6.4 (3.7-12.0) months, respectively. The overall response rate (95% CI) among 17 evaluable patients was 17.6% (3.8-43.4%), including 6% confirmed complete responders and 12% unconfirmed partial responders. Two deaths resulted from protocol treatment (sudden death and gastrointestinal necrosis). Ten (47.6%) and 6 (28.6%) patients had grade-3 or -4 toxicity, respectively: 52.4% were hematologic, 23.8% had fatigue, 19.0% had nausea, 19.0% had dehydration, and 19.0% had anorexia. Conclusion(s): Concomitant cetuximab, cisplatin, irinotecan, and TRT were poorly tolerated in the first North American cooperative group trial testing this regimen for locally advanced esophageal cancer as treatment-related mortality approached 10%.

834,"Brachytherapy for early oral tongue cancer: low dose rate to high dose rate To examine the compatibility of low dose rate (LDR) with high dose rate (HDR) brachytherapy, we reviewed 399 patients with early oral tongue cancer (T1-2N0M0) treated solely by brachytherapy at Osaka University Hospital between 1967 and 1999. For patients in the LDR group (n = 341), the treatment sources consisted of Ir-192 pin for 227 patients (1973-1996; irradiated dose, 61-85 Gy; median, 70 Gy), Ra-226 needle for 113 patients (1967-1986; 55-93 Gy; median, 70 Gy). Ra-226 and Ir-192 were combined for one patient. Ir-192 HDR (microSelectron-HDR) was used for 58 patients in the HDR group (1991-present; 48-60 Gy; median, 60 Gy). LDR implantations were performed via oral and HDR via a submental/submandibular approach. The dose rates at the reference point for the LDR group were 0.30 to 0.8 Gy/h, and for the HDR group 1.0 to 3.4 Gy/min. The patients in the HDR group received a total dose of 48-60 Gy (8-10 fractions) during one week. Two fractions were administered per day (at least a 6-h interval). The 3- and 5-year local control rates for patients in the LDR group were 85% and 80%, respectively, and those in the HDR group were both 84%. HDR brachytherapy showed the same lymph-node control rate as did LDR brachytherapy (67% at 5 years). HDR brachytherapy achieved the same locoregional result as did LDR brachytherapy. A converting factor of 0.86 is applicable for HDR in the treatment of early oral tongue cancer.",Excluded
944,"RETROSPECTIVE ESTIMATION OF PATIENT DOSE-AREA PRODUCT IN THORACIC SPINE TOMOSYNTHESIS PERFORMED USING VOLUMERAD The aim of this study was to evaluate the use of a recently developed method of retrospectively estimating the patient dose-area product (DAP) of a chest tomosynthesis examination, performed using VolumeRAD, in thoracic spine tomosynthesis and to determine the necessary field-size correction factor. Digital imaging and communications in medicine (DICOM) data for the projection radiographs acquired during a thoracic spine tomosynthesis examination were retrieved directly from the modality for 17 patients. Using the previously developed method, an estimated DAP for the tomosynthesis examination was determined from DICOM data in the scout image. By comparing the estimated DAP with the actual DAP registered for the projection radiographs, a field-size correction factor was determined. The field-size correction factor for thoracic spine tomosynthesis was determined to 0.92. Applying this factor to the DAP estimated retrospectively, the maximum difference between the estimated DAP and the actual DAP was <3 %. In conclusion, the previously developed method of retrospectively estimating the DAP in chest tomosynthesis can be applied to thoracic spine tomosynthesis. Copyright © The Author 2015.

1070,"Prediction of LIVER Toxicity with Stereotactic Body Radiotherapy: A Dosimetric Analysis Purpose/Objective(s): To further evaluate the corresponding dosimetric factors with the liver toxicity following stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT). Materials/Methods: Between 2015-2018, 76 patients with liver tumor (primary or metastases) treated with SBRT were reviewed based on dosimetric factors and liver function tests. The reference point was contoured that the main portal ven divided in the liver hilum into the left portal vein branch and the right portal vein branch on the contrast enhanced simulation CT scan set. Two different isotropic expansions from the reference point were generated as 2(zone 1) and 4 cm(zon 2). Out of zone 2 was defined as zone 3 in the rest of liver. The radiation doses of each zones were converted BED 10 and tested for correlation with liver functon tests which were obtained during follow up. Liver functions were assessed with Drug-Induced Liver Injury Network (DILIN) grading system for liver disease severity. Result(s): Median follow up was 10 months (range 6-36 months). Four of 76 patients were diagnosed with primary liver tumor(Hepatocellulary ca), rest of 72 patients were diagnosed secondary tumor(kolorectal 30, lung 21, breast 13, other 8). Median age was 64(range 48-76). Sixteen of patients have grade 1 liver disfunction, 4 of patients have grade 2 toxicity after radiotherapy. The prescription doses were 45-60 Gy in 3-5 fractions. Median tumor volume was 24.4 cc(range 8.5-39.9 cc). The volume of received 20 Gy (VBED1020) more than 50 cc in the zone 2, was significantly correlated with grade 1 toxicity(p=0.03). Conclusion(s): These results suggest that the volume of received 20 Gy more than 50 cc dose to 2 cm expansion from reference point in the liver may be associated with acute liver enzyme abnormality. This dosimetric parameter has potential implications for future liver SBRT studies.Copyright © 2019",Excluded

630,"Exposure of patients to low doses of X-radiation during neuro-interventional imaging and procedures: Dose estimation and analysis of gamma-H2AX foci and gene expression in blood lymphocytes Radiation has widespread applications in medicine. However, despite the benefits of medical radiation exposures, adverse long-term health effects are cause for concern. Protein and gene biomarkers are early indicators of cellular response after low-dose exposure. We examined DNA damage by quantifying gamma-H2AX foci and expression of twelve candidate genes in the blood lymphocytes of patients exposed to low doses of X-radiation during neuro-interventional procedures. Entrance surface dose (ESD; 10.92-1062.55 mGy) was measured by thermoluminescence dosimetry (TLD). Absorbed dose was estimated using gamma-H2AX focus frequency and gene expression, with in vitro dose-response curves generated for the same biomarkers. gamma-H2AX foci in post-exposure samples were significantly higher than in pre-exposure samples. Among the genes analysed, FDXR, ATM, BCL2, MDM2, TNFSF9, and PCNA showed increased expression; CDKN1A, DDB2, SESN1, BAX, and TNFRSF10B showed unchanged or decreased expression. Absorbed dose, estimated based on gamma-H2AX focus frequency and gene expression changes, did not show any correlation with measured ESD. Patients undergoing interventional procedures receive considerable radiation doses, resulting in DNA damage and altered gene expression. Medical procedures should be carried out using the lowest radiation doses possible without compromising treatment. Copyright © 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",Excluded
999,"Oblique corpectomy for treatment of cervical spine epidural abscesses: Report on four cases Background Spinal epidural abscesses (SEAs) in cervical locations are particularly life-threatening. Currently, SEAs are widely treated with bony decompression, followed by internal stabilization in purulent osteomyelitis. However, recently, a growing number of studies have reported minimally invasive approaches without internal fixation. Purpose We describe four patients with cervical SEAs that were evacuated by oblique corpectomy (OC) without fusion. Methods This study included two women and two men (aged 44-90) that received operations for removing ventral cervical SEAs. All patients presented with progressively increasing myelopathy, and 3 had severe comorbid conditions. In all cases, a multilevel OC without fusion was performed. The amount of bone resection was tailored to fit the needs of granulation removal, with an effort to retain as much of the vertebral bodies as possible. Then, pus was evacuated and debridement of granulation was performed, followed by rinsing and drainage. Results The neurological status of 3 patients improved significantly after surgery. At the last follow-up examination, one showed full recovery, and in two a minor residual deficit persisted. During mean follow-up of 5.5 years, no internal stabilization was necessary. The oldest patient was tetraplegic, and had several concomitant diseases. That patient died from sudden cardiac arrest on the third postoperative day. Oblique corpectomy did not affect the anterior or posterior column. Additionally, it provided a broad view of the ventral aspect of the spinal canal. Conclusions Oblique corpectomy allows appropriate spinal cord decompression and granulation removal in the case of cervical spine epidural abscess, without sacrificing spinal stability.Copyright © 2016",Excluded
1019,"Lung cancer mortality among uranium gaseous diffusion plant workers: A cohort study 1952-2004 Background: 9%-15% of all lung cancers are attributable to occupational exposures. Reports are disparate regarding elevated lung cancer mortality risk among workers employed at uranium gaseous diffusion plants. Objective(s): To investigate whether external radiation exposure is associated with lung cancer mortality risk among uranium gaseous diffusion workers. Method(s): A cohort of 6820 nuclear industry workers employed from 1952 to 2003 at the Paducah uranium gaseous diffusion plant (PGDP) was assembled. A job-specific exposure matrix (JEM) was used to determine likely toxic metal exposure categories. In addition, radiation film badge dosimeters were used to monitor cumulative external ionizing radiation exposure. International Classification for Disease (ICD) codes 9 and 10 were used to identify 147 lung cancer deaths. Logistic and proportional hazards regression were used to estimate lung cancer mortality risk. Result(s): Lung cancer mortality risk was elevated among workers who experienced external radiation >3.5 mrem and employment duration >12 years. Conclusion(s): Employees of uranium gaseous diffusion plants carry a higher risk of lung cancer mortality; the mortality is associated with increased radiation exposure and duration of employment.",Included
831,"Computer-Assisted Distal Radius Osteotomy Purpose: To establish the accuracy, precision, and clinical feasibility of a novel technique of computer-assisted distal radius osteotomy for the correction of symptomatic distal radius malunion. Method(s): Six patients underwent a computer-assisted distal radius osteotomy and were followed-up for an average of 25 months. Objective radiographic measurements and functional outcomes, as measured by clinical examination including grip strength and range of motion, and Disability of the Arm, Shoulder and Hand (DASH) questionnaires, were used. Result(s): The mean radiographic parameters included an increase of radial inclination to 21degree from 12degree (normal, 23degree). Dorsal and volar tilt (malunion) were corrected to 9degree from -30degree and 21degree, respectively (normal, 10degree). Ulnar variance was corrected to 1.9 mm from 7.5 mm (normal, +1.5 mm). Normal is defined as the average of the contralateral limb radiographs. The mean clinical outcome measures at an average of 25 months included a DASH global score of 14, a DASH individual item average score of 1.6, and an average affected side grip strength of 79% when compared with the unaffected side. Conclusion(s): The results of the computer-assisted technique were comparable with published results of traditional non-computer-assisted opening wedge osteotomy techniques. This technique allows a surgeon to accurately and precisely recognize and correct 3-dimensional deformities of the distal radius including axial malalignment (supination). The technique has the added benefit of reducing radiation exposure to the patient and surgical team because fluoroscopy is not used during the procedure. Additional benefits of the computer-assisted technique include the ability to perform multiple surgical simulations to optimize the alignment plan, and it serves as an excellent teaching tool for less-experienced surgeons.

With this technique the lymph node groups needing a treatment can be irradiated without overlappings or gaps, and thus the therapy reliability is considerably improved. The side effects are limited with respect to the large volume dose, in the individual case they can easily be eliminated by reducing the single dose. Gastrointestinal side effects can be controlled by chemotherapy in a satisfactory manner. Only in very few cases the modifications of the white blood count necessitated a short interruption of the therapy cycle. Furthermore, the simplified and easily reproducible focussing of the individual fields is especially appreciated by the technical staff.",Excluded
489,"CT urography in the urinary bladder: to compare excretory phase images using a low noise index and a high noise index with adaptive noise reduction filter BACKGROUND: Although CT urography (CTU) is widely used for the evaluation of the entire urinary tract, the most important drawback is the radiation exposure., PURPOSE: To evaluate the effect of a noise reduction filter (NRF) using a phantom and to quantitatively and qualitatively compare excretory phase (EP) images using a low noise index (NI) with those using a high NI and postprocessing NRF (pNRF)., MATERIAL AND METHODS: Each NI value was defined for a slice thickness of 5 mm, and reconstructed images with a slice thickness of 1.25 mm were assessed. Sixty patients who were at high risk of developing bladder tumors (BT) were divided into two groups according to whether their EP images were obtained using an NI of 9.88 (29 patients; group A) or an NI of 20 and pNRF (31 patients; group B). The CT dose index volume (CTDI(vol)) and the contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR) of the bladder with respect to the anterior pelvic fat were compared in both groups. Qualitative assessment of the urinary bladder for image noise, sharpness, streak artifacts, homogeneity, and the conspicuity of polypoid or sessile-shaped BTs with a short-axis diameter greater than 10 mm was performed using a 3-point scale., RESULTS: The phantom study showed noise reduction of approximately 40% and 76% dose reduction between group A and group B. CTDI(vol) demonstrated a 73% reduction in group B (4.6 +/- 1.1 mGy) compared with group A (16.9 +/- 3.4 mGy). The CNR value was not significantly different (P = 0.60) between group A (16.1 +/- 5.1) and group B (16.6 +/- 7.6). Although group A was superior (P < 0.01) to group B with regard to image noise, other qualitative analyses did not show significant differences., CONCLUSION: EP images using a high NI and pNRF were quantitatively and qualitatively comparable to those using a low NI, except with regard to image noise.",Excluded
1139,"The perceived transmittance of inhomogeneous surfaces and media A series of experiments was performed to determine how the visual system computes the transmittance of inhomogeneous surfaces and media. Previous work (Anderson, B. L. (1999) Stereoscopic surface perception. Neuron, 26, 919-928; Anderson, B. L. (2003) The role of occlusion in the perception of depth, lightness, and opacity. Psychological Review, 110, 762-784) has suggested that the visual system employs a transmittance anchoring principle in determining when transparency is perceived. This principle states that the visual system interprets the highest contrast region along contours and surfaces as a region in plain view and uses this anchor as a reference point for transparency computations. In particular, recent work has shown that the transmittance of homogeneous transparent surfaces is well described by a ratio of contrasts model (Singh, M., & Anderson, B. L. (2002). Toward a perceptual theory of transparency. Psychological Review, 109, 492-519). In this model, the transmittance of a transparent surface is determined by the contrast of a transparent image region normalized by the contrast of the region in plain view. Here, a series of experiments is reported that assesses this model for inhomogeneous transparent surfaces that vary in both space and time. The results of these experiments reveal that transmittance anchoring has both a spatial and temporal component, and that the perceived transmittance of transparent surfaces is well described by a ratio of perceived contrasts model.",Excluded
73,"Core decompression combined with implantation of a demineralised bone matrix for non-traumatic osteonecrosis of the femoral head Introduction: Core decompression is the standard surgical procedure in the treatment of early stage non-traumatic osteonecrosis of the femoral head (ONFH). However, there is still a debate whether decompression in combination with supplementary augmentation by bone grafts, growth factors, or cell implementation is superior to conventional decompression alone. This study evaluated patients after core decompression combined with an augmentation by a demineralised bone matrix, and particularly aimed to report long-term conversion rates to total hip replacement (THR). Material(s) and Method(s): 14 patients with 18 hips suVering from ONFH (Ficat stage I-IIB) underwent this surgical procedure. All patients underwent radiographic and MRI investigations at baseline and at follow-up periods of 12 and 24 months. The clinical follow-up was done using the Merle d'Aubigne-score for an average period of 9 years after surgery. Result(s): 14 of the 18 subjects (77 %) achieved at least a good clinical result after 2 years. The Merle d'Aubignescore improved signiWcantly after 12 (p = 0.0001) and 24 months (p = 0.0002). However, the MRI volumetric analysis showed an increased necrotic bone volume from 3.16 +/- 0.54 to 3.88 +/- 0.62 cm3 (p = 0.04). Within 9 years, 13 out of 18 cases (72 %) required further surgery by THR. Only 7 out of 18 subjects (39 %) reported an ongoing postoperative clinical beneWt, and would retrospectively redo the same surgical approach again. The Wve patients that did not require THR were still satisWed after 9 years. Conclusion(s): In patients with early- stage femoral head osteonecrosis core decompression combined with the implantation of a demineralised bone matrix leads to a limited, temporary pain relief as seen in core decompression alone. However, long-term results were not encouraging with a high rate of conversion to arthroplasty. Therefore, core decompression with implantation of a demineralised bone matrix may be not appropriate to avoid THR in the long term. © Springer-Verlag 2012.",Excluded
435,"Assessment of Corneal Backward Light Scattering in Diabetic Patients OBJECTIVES: To analyze corneal backward light scattering differences in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus., METHODS: We enrolled 43 eyes from 43 diabetic patients and 40 eyes from 40 healthy controls. Corneal backward light scattering was evaluated using densitometry measurements from different corneal layers and zones obtained using Scheimpflug tomography (PentacamHR)., RESULTS: When densitometry values were divided by depth, anterior layer of diabetic corneas displayed significantly higher corneal backward light scattering values than controls (32.05, 95% confidence intervals [CI], 31.02-33.08 vs. 29.18, 95% CI, 27.60-30.76, P=0.024). Corneal densitometry measurements were also significantly higher in diabetic eyes compared with control eyes, when considered by concentric zones of total cornea in the 0 to 2 mm (21.65, 95% CI, 20.28-23.01 vs. 18.87 95% CI, 18.49-19.25, P=0.020), and anterior layer in the 0 to 2 mm (27.3, 95% CI, 25.04-29.56 vs. 22.31, 95% CI, 20.57-24.05, P<0.001), 2 to 6 mm (26.2, 95% CI, 24.99-27.41 vs. 22.4, 95% CI, 20.18-24.62, P<0.001) and 6 to 10 mm (32.19, 95% CI, 29.98-34.40 vs. 27.2, 95% CI, 25.39-29.01, P=0.022).

Methods and Materials: A survey of 36 questions was designed to collect information regarding practice patterns of radiation oncologists for the management of patients with NSCLC. All American Society for Radiation Oncology members were invited to respond. Result(s): Four hundred twenty-four responses from radiation oncologists in the United States were received. The response rate for the survey was approximately 20%. Substantial discrepancies were seen in the use of stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) for patients with peripherally and centrally located early-stage tumors and in the recommended SBRT dose. There was a near consensus opinion regarding the use of concurrent chemotherapy and the radiation dose for patients with inoperable stage II and III NSCLC with a good performance status; however, in patients with a poor performance status or in patients with stage IV disease treatment recommendations differed remarkably. Additionally, the use of elective nodal irradiation and the assessment of tumor motion during simulation were highly variable. Thoracic radiation oncologists were more likely to prescribe higher doses, omit elective nodal irradiation, and use advanced technologies (P < .001). Conclusion(s): Substantial variations were seen in the management of patients with stage I and IV NSCLC in addition to the incorporation of new technology.

867,"18F-fluorocholine versus 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose for PET/CT imaging in patients with suspected relapsing or progressive multiple myeloma: a pilot study Purpose: Hybrid positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) has now become available, as well as whole-body, low-dose multidetector row computed tomography (MDCT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). The radioactive glucose analogue 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) is the most widely used tracer but has a relatively low sensitivity in detecting multiple myeloma (MM). We compared FDG with a more recent metabolic tracer, 18F-fluorocholine (FCH), for the detection of MM lesions at time of disease relapse or progression. Method(s): We analyzed the results of FDG and FCH imaging in 21 MM patients undergoing PET/CT for suspected relapsing or progressive MM. For each patient and each tracer, an on-site reader and a masked reader independently determined the number of intraosseous and extraosseous foci of tracer and the intensity of uptake as measured by their SUVmax and the corresponding target/non-target ratio (T/NT). Result(s): In the skeleton of 21 patients, no foci were found for two cases, uncountable foci were observed in four patients, including some mismatched FCH/FDG foci. In the 15 patients with countable bone foci, the on-site reader detected 72 FDG foci vs. 127 FCH foci (+76 %), whereas the masked reader detected 69 FDG foci vs. 121 FCH foci (+75 %), both differences being significant. Interobserver agreement on the total number of bone foci was very high, with a kappa coefficient of 0.81 for FDG and 0.89 for FCH. Measurement of uptake in the matched foci that took up both tracers revealed a significantly higher median SUVmax and T/NT for FCH vs. FDG. Almost all unmatched foci were FCH-positive FDG-negative (57/59 = 97 % on-site and 56/60 = 93 % on masked reading); they were more frequently observed than matched foci in the head and neck region. Conclusion(s): These findings suggest that PET/CT performed for suspected relapsing or progressive MM would reveal more lesions when using FCH rather than FDG.Copyright © 2016, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.",Excluded
877,"Gamma radiation tolerance in different life stages of the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster PURPOSE: Insects are known to have higher levels of radiation tolerance than mammals. The fruit fly Drosophila provides opportunities for genetic analysis of radiation tolerance in insects. A knowledge of stage-specific sensitivity is required to understand the mechanisms and test the existing hypothesis of insect radiation tolerance., MATERIALS AND METHODS: Drosophila melanogaster were irradiated using gamma rays at different life stages. Irradiation doses were chosen to start from 100-2200 Gy with increments of 100 Gy, with a dose rate of 12.5 and 25 Gy/min. The threshold of mortality, LD50 and LD100 1 h post-irradiation was recorded for larvae and adults and 24 h post-irradiation for eggs and after 2-3 days for early and late pupae. Total antioxidant capacity for all the life stages was measured using the phosphomolybdenum method., RESULTS: Twenty-four hours post-irradiation, 100% mortality was recorded for eggs at 1000 Gy. One hour post irradiation 100% mortality was recorded at 1300 Gy for first instar larvae, 1700 Gy for second instar larvae, 1900 Gy for feeding third instar larvae and 2200 Gy for non-feeding third instar larvae. Post-irradiation complete failure of emergence (100% mortality) was observed at 130 Gy for early pupae and 1500 Gy for late pupae; 100% mortality was observed at 1500 Gy for adults. The values of LD50 were recorded as 452 Gy for eggs, 1049 Gy for first instar larvae, 1350 Gy for second instar larvae, 1265 Gy for feeding third instar larvae, 1590 Gy for non-feeding third instar larvae, 50 Gy for early pupae, 969 Gy for late pupae, 1228 Gy for adult males and 1250 Gy for adult females., CONCLUSIONS: Early pupae were found to be prone to radiation, whereas the non-feeding third instar larvae were most resistant among all stages. The chromosome number being constant and total antioxidant capacity being nearly constant in all stages, we suggest that high rate of cell division during early pupae makes this stage sensitive to radiation.",Included
118,"Nrf2 activation protects against solar-simulated ultraviolet radiation in mice and humans The transcription factor Nrf2 determines the ability to adapt and survive under conditions of electrophilic, oxidative, and inflammatory stress by regulating the expression of elaborate networks comprising nearly 500 genes encoding proteins with versatile cytoprotective functions. In mice, disruption of Nrf2 increases susceptibility to carcinogens and accelerates disease pathogenesis. Paradoxically, Nrf2 is upregulated in established human tumors, but whether this upregulation drives carcinogenesis is not known. Here we show that the incidence, multiplicity, and burden of solar-simulated UV radiation-mediated cutaneous tumors that form in SKH-1 hairless mice in which Nrf2 is genetically constitutively activated are lower than those that arise in their wild-type counterparts. Pharmacologic Nrf2 activation by topical biweekly applications of small (40 nmol) quantities of the potent bis(cyano enone) inducer TBE-31 has a similar protective effect against solar-simulated UV radiation in animals receiving long-term treatment with the immunosuppressive agent azathioprine. Genetic or pharmacologic Nrf2 activation lowers the expression of the pro-inflammatory factors IL6 and IL1beta, and COX2 after acute exposure of mice to UV radiation. In healthy human subjects, topical applications of extracts delivering the Nrf2 activator sulforaphane reduced the degree of solar-simulated UV radiation-induced skin erythema, a quantifiable surrogate endpoint for cutaneous damage and skin cancer risk. Collectively, these data show that Nrf2 is not a driver for tumorigenesis even upon exposure to a very potent and complete carcinogen and strongly suggest that the frequent activation of Nrf2 in established human tumors is a marker of metabolic adaptation.Copyright © 2015 American Association for Cancer Research.",Excluded

Progression free survival: 81.8% (@6m), 63.6% (@12m), 54.5% (@24m). Overall survival: 92.3% (@3m), 84.6% (@6m), 67.3% (@12m), 25.6% (@24m). Maximum dose for optic apparatus BED2 (Gy): 84-229 Gy (median 98.3Gy). Only 1 case became entirely blind 12 months after CyberKnife for 6 months until her death, despite tumor reduction. In this case, maximum dose for optic apparatus BED2 (Gy) was 229 Gy (highest). CONCLUSION(S): These preliminary results seem to indicate that CyberKnife SRT is a safe, effective and palliative treatment for most patients with pituitary metastasis. To prevent radiation induced optic neuropathy, maximum dose for optic apparatus BED2 (Gy) is under 126 Gy (single dose equivalent: 15Gy). Its safety and efficacy remain to be observed in long-term follow up.",Excluded
743,"Vitamin D receptor gene polymorphisms in multiple sclerosis patients in northwest Greece Background: Polymorphisms of the vitamin D receptor (VDR) gene have been linked to both multiple sclerosis (MS) and osteoporosis. We examined the frequency of the Taq-I and Bsm-I polymorphisms of the vitamin D receptor (VDR) gene in 69 patients with MS and 81 age and sex-matched healthy individuals. Genotyping of Taq-I (rs731236) and Bsm-I (rs1544410) was performed using TaqMan SNP Genotyping Assay. All patients and controls had determination of body mass index (BMI), bone mineral density (BMD) and smoking history. Result(s): The mean age of patients was 39 +/- 10.5 years compared to 38.7 +/- 10.7 years of the controls (p = 0.86), the BMI was 24.8 +/-4.2 kg/m2 compared to 25.7 4.8 kg/m2 of the controls (p = 0.23), the BMD in the lumbar spine 0.981 0.15 compared to 1.025 +/- 013 of the controls (p = 0.06) and the total hip BMD was 0.875 +/- 0.14 compared to 0.969 +/- 0.12 of the controls (p < 0.001). There were no differences of the Taq-I (TT, CT, CC) and Bsm-I genotypes (GG, GA, AA) and allelic frequencies between MS and control individuals. Multivariate analysis also failed to show any association of the Taq-I and Bsm-I polymorphisms and MS or sex, BMI, BMD and smoking history. Conclusion(s): This study suggests that the Taq-I and Bsm-I polymorphisms of the VDR gene are not associated with MS risk, BMI or BMD in the Greek population studied. © 2011 Sioka et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",Excluded
698,"Percutaneous lung biopsies: performance of an optical CT-based navigation system with a low-dose protocol OBJECTIVES: To compare patients' radiation exposure, technical feasibility, imaging quality and complication rate of percutaneous lung biopsies (PLBs) performed with a low-dose (LD) CT protocol under guidance of an optical navigation system., METHODS: Fifty-two consecutive patients with suspected malignant lung lesions were enrolled and randomised into group 1 (PLBs under the guidance of the navigation system) and group 2 (PLBs under the guidance navigation system with an LD protocol). Patients' demographics, lesion features, procedure-related variables and CT image quality for group 2 were recorded and compared., RESULTS: Technical success was 100 % in both groups. The radiation dose to patients' chest was significantly lower in group 2 than in group 1 (group 1: mean TDLP 206 +/- 59 mGy.cm, ~ 3.5 +/- 1.0 mSv; group 2: 54.2 +/- 46.2 mGy.cm, ~ 0.92 +/- 0.78 mSv; P < 0.0001). The PNX rate was 12 % in group 1 and 11.1 % in group 2. The haemoptysis rate was 8.0 % in group 1 and 3.7 % in group 2. CT image quality obtained in group 2 was always rated as adequate and as excellent in 15 cases (56.0 %)., CONCLUSIONS: An optical navigation system with LD CT protocol is useful for performing lung biopsies with decreased patient radiation exposure., KEY POINTS: * Navigation systems are useful tools in percutaneous imaging-guided procedures. * For lung biopsies, low-dose (LD) CT protocols may be used. * Combining LD protocols with optical CT navigation results in significantly reduced radiation exposure.",Excluded
459,"Angiotensin receptor blockade: a novel approach for symptomatic radiation necrosis after stereotactic radiosurgery Preclinical evidence suggests angiotensin blockade therapy (ABT) decreases late radiation toxicities. This study aims to investigate the association between ABT and symptomatic radiation necrosis (SRN) following stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS). Resected brain metastases (rBM) and arteriovenous malformation (AVM) patients treated with SRS from 2002 to 2015 were identified. Patients in the ABT cohort were on therapy during SRS and at 1-month follow up. Kaplan Meier method and cumulative incidence model were used to analyze overall survival (OS) and intracranial outcomes. 228 consecutive patients were treated with SRS: 111 with rBM and 117 with AVM. Overall, 51 (22.4%) patients were in the ABT group: 32 (28.8%) in the rBM and 19 (16.2%) in AVM cohorts. Baseline characteristics were similar, except for higher Graded Prognostic Analysis (3-4) in the rBM (ABT: 25.0% vs. non-ABT: 49.0%, p = 0.033) and median age in the AVM (ABT: 51.4 vs. non-ABT: 35.4, p < 0.001) cohorts. In both populations, OS and intracranial efficacy (rBM-local control; AVM-obliteration rates) were statistically similar between the cohorts. ABT was associated with lower 1-year SRN rates in both populations: rBM, 3.1 versus 25.3% (p = 0.003); AVM, 6.7 vs. 14.6% (p = 0.063). On multivariate analysis, ABT was a significant predictive factor for rBM (HR: 0.17; 95% CI 0.03-0.88, p = 0.035), but did not reach statistical significance for AVM (HR: 0.36; 95% CI 0.09-1.52, p = 0.165). ABT use appears to be associated with a reduced risk of SRN following SRS, without detriment to OS or intracranial efficacy. A prospective trial to validate these findings is warranted.",Excluded
779,"S-R difference in V1-V2 is a novel criterion for differentiating the left from right ventricular outflow tract arrhythmias AIM: The correct estimation of the VA origin as RVOT or LVOT results in reduced ablation duration reduced radiation exposure and decreased number of vascular access. In our study, we aimed to detect the predictive value of S-R difference in V1-V2 for differentiating the left from right ventricular outflow tract arrhythmias., METHODS: We included 123 patients with symptomatic frequent premature ventricular outflow tract contractions who underwent successful catheter ablation (70 male, 53 female; mean age 46.2 +/- 13.9 years, 61 RVOT, 62 LVOT origins). S-R difference in V1-V2 was calculated with this formula on the 12-lead surface ECG: (V1S + V2S) - (V1R + V2R). Conventional ablation was performed in 101 (82.1%) patients, CARTO electroanatomic mapping system was used in 22 (17.9%) patients., RESULTS: V1-2 SRd was found to be significantly lower for LVOT origins than RVOT origins (p < .001). The cutoff value of V1-2 SRd obtained by ROC curve analysis was 1.625 mV for prediction of RVOT origin (sensitivity: 95.1%, specificity: 85.5%, positive predictive value: 86.5%, negative predictive value: 94.5%). The area under the curve (AUC) was 0.929 (p < .001)., CONCLUSION: S-R difference in V1-V2 is a novel and simple electrocardiographic criterion for accurately differentiating RVOT from LVOT sites of ventricular arrhythmia origins. The use of this simple ECG measurement could improve the accuracy of OTVA localization, could be beneficial for decreasing ablation duration and radiation exposure. Further studies with larger patient population are needed to verify the results of this study. Copyright © 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",Excluded
928,"Contemporary Discrepancies of Stenosis Assessment by Computed Tomography and Invasive Coronary Angiography Background Ongoing advancements of coronary computed tomographic angiography (CTA) continue to challenge the role of invasive coronary angiography (ICA) as the gold standard for the evaluation of coronary artery disease (CAD). We sought to investigate the diagnostic accuracy of 320-slice CTA for detecting obstructive CAD in reference to ICA and nuclear myocardial perfusion imaging using single-photon emission computed tomography. Methods For the CORE320 study (Coronary Artery Evaluation Using 320-Row Multidetector Computed Tomography Angiography and Myocardial Perfusion), 381 patients at 16 centers underwent CTA, nuclear myocardial perfusion imaging by single-photon emission computed tomography, and ICA for the evaluation of CAD. Imaging studies were analyzed in blinded core laboratories, and a stenosis of >=50% by quantitative coronary angiography was considered obstructive, whereas a stress difference score of >=1 indicated inducible myocardial ischemia. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve was used to evaluate diagnostic accuracy. Results Of 381 patients, 229 (60%) had obstructive CAD by quantitative coronary angiography. Diagnostic accuracy of CTA on a per-patient analysis revealed an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.90 (95% CI, 0.87-0.93). Per-vessel and per-segment analysis revealed lower area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.87 (0.84-0.90) and 0.81 (0.78-0.83), respectively. Median radiation dose was lower for CTA versus ICA: 3.16 (interquartile range, 2.82-3.59) versus 11.97 (interquartile range, 7.60-17.8) mSv ( P<0.001). Accuracy for identifying patients with inducible myocardial ischemia by SPECT-MPI was similar for CTA and ICA (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve, 0.68 versus 0.71 by quantitative coronary angiography and 0.68 by visual angiographic assessment; P>0.05). Furthermore, accuracy for identifying patients who subsequently underwent clinically driven coronary revascularization also was similar for CTA (0.76 [0.71-0.81]) and ICA (0.78 [0.74-0.83]; P=0.20). Conclusions Contemporary CTA accurately identifies patients with obstructive CAD by ICA at lower radiation exposure; however, agreement is lower in vessel- and segment-level analyses. Both CTA and ICA perform similarly for predicting clinically driven revascularization and for detecting myocardial ischemia by myocardial perfusion imaging using single-photon emission computed tomography, suggesting that limitations by both CTA and ICA contribute to variability of stenosis quantification.

1116,"Effectiveness of Positron Emission Tomography/Computed Tomography as a Guide for Palliative Radiation Therapy for Spinal Metastases Objective: As back pain is the presenting symptom in 95% of patients with epidural spinal metastases, appropriately identifying and treating the most symptomatic levels can provide significant palliation. The purpose of this study was to analyze the ability of combined positron emission tomography (PET)/computed tomography (CT) to identify spinal metastases with high metabolic activity and guide radiotherapy. We sought to correlate improvement in back pain with reduction in standard uptake value (SUV) after treatment. Method(s): Retrospective review was performed of 72 patients with spinal metastases treated with stereotactic ablative radiation therapy at a single center between 2002 and 2014. PET/CT was used to calculate SUVs for spinal metastases, and treatment planning was based on PET/CT results. Preoperative and postoperative pain levels were assessed in all patients. Result(s): Reduction in pain scores was found in 78% of treated patients. A significant reduction in pain was identified in patients with >5 metastases compared with fewer lesions (P < 0.05). Degree of change in SUV did not correlate significantly with pain relief. However, comparing pretreatment and posttreatment PET/CT, patients with improved pain consistently displayed decreased SUV. Conclusion(s): PET/CT was shown to be a useful adjunct in radiation treatment planning with change in SUV correlating with symptomatic improvement. This study paves the way for future prospective studies to further assess utility and cost-effectiveness of this imaging modality in radiation treatment planning for spinal metastases.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.",Excluded
357,"Dynamic change of optical quality in patients with dry eye disease PURPOSE: To evaluate the dynamic changes of optical quality in patients with dry eye disease (DED) by using a double-pass system., METHODS: Fifty-six patients with DED and 35 control subjects were included in this study. Each patient underwent an evaluation of the ocular surface, using the Ocular Surface Disease Index, tear film breakup time (TBUT), corneal and conjunctival staining (Oxford scale), and Schirmer I test. Using the tear film analysis program of the Optical Quality Analysis System, we recorded the objective scatter index (OSI) every 0.5 seconds within a 20-second period with the subjects asked to blink freely. Several parameters were established to evaluate the dynamic alterations of optical quality and the effects of blinks: OSI standard deviation (SD), DELTAOSI, DELTAOSI/time, blinking change (BC), blinking frequency (BF), and tolerant limitation (TL)., RESULTS: Patients with DED had significant alterations of optical quality compared to control subjects. The DELTAOSI, DELTAOSI/time, BC, and BF were significantly higher and TL was significantly lower in DED patients than controls. Furthermore, the DELTAOSI and DELTAOSI/time were also significantly higher in patients with severe DED than patients with mild disease. In univariate analysis, both TBUT and corneal staining were correlated with DELTAOSI, DELTAOSI/time, and BC. In multivariate analysis, DELTAOSI/time was correlated to the corneal staining score., CONCLUSIONS: The double-pass system allowed the monitoring of the dynamic changes of optical quality in patients with DED. Optical quality should be evaluated in patients with DED because these alterations cannot be determined from the classical DED clinical tests.",Excluded
982,"Arthrodesis after osteosynthesis and infection of the ankle joint Nineteen patients with a severely infected ankle joint after previous osteosynthesis were treated with arthrodesis in our institution. Their notes and X-rays were reviewed.Goals of treatment were eradication of infection by aggressive debridement of infected tissues, obtaining adequate soft-tissue coverage, preservation/restoration of bonelength, and finally consolidation of the arthrodesis.Thirteen men and six women were treated, with a median age of 46 (17-69) years. Arthrodesis took place after a median of 6 months (0.5-40) post-accident, and after one to six earlier operative procedures. Primarily there had been four bimalleolar, five trimalleolar and ten pilon tibial fractures. Fifteen fractures were open with severe soft tissue damage.Seven free muscle transfers were performed, and ten cancellous bone graftings. Finally 29 attempts at arthrodesis were performed. Ultimately we had to perform two amputations. After a mean follow up of 3.5 years, one patient has an aseptic but asymptomatic pseudarthrosis, for which no further surgery is scheduled. Sixteen extremities are free from infection while full weightbearing is possible.The limb-threatening problem of deep infection after osteosynthesis of an ankle fracture can be resolved by consistent but prolonged treatment.

517,"A comparison of the semiflexed (MTP) view with the standing extended view (SEV) in the radiographic assessment of knee osteoarthritis in a busy routine X-ray department Objective. To compare the reproducibility of the standing extended view (SEV) (also known as the standing anteroposterior view) with the semiflexed, postero-anterior view [the 'metatarsophalangeal' (MTP)] view for assessing joint space width (JSW) and osteophytes in osteoarthritis of the knee when used in a busy routine X-ray department. Methods. Forty-seven patients (24 men) had both SEV and MTP views taken on the same day in a busy National Health Service radiography department. Repeat views were taken as entirely separate procedures some time over the following 2 weeks, in the same department and with no special arrangements for the selection of radiographers, time of day, or X-ray machine. The first 24 patients had second views in the SEV position whilst the remaining 23 had second MTP views. Radiographs were read independently by two experienced observers who measured JSW with a transparent ruler to the nearest 0.5 mm at the narrowest point in both medial and lateral compartments of the tibiofemoral joint in both knees. Osteophytes were graded 0-2 according to a standard atlas. Ten SEV and 10 MTP radiographs selected randomly were re-read by one observer. Results. Mean (95% confidence interval) JSW in the medial compartment measured on SEV radiographs was 3.54 mm (3.08, 3.99) and on MTP radiographs it was 2.80 mm (2.37, 3.23); in the lateral compartment it was 6.04 mm (5.71, 6.37) when measured on SEV radiographs and 5.47 mm (5.09, 5.85) on MTP radiographs. The estimated variances for the medial compartment were 2.0 mm2 for SEV and 0.2 mm2 for MTP (P < 0.001) and for the lateral compartment 1.4 mm2 for SEV and 0.5 mm2 for MTP (P < 0.001). The proportion of radiographs for which there was disagreement between observers regarding osteophyte grade was not statistically different between SEV and MTP views (SEV, medial 40%, lateral 44%; MTP, medial 39%, lateral 39%). Conclusions. Even when radiographs are taken in a busy National Health Service radiography department, measurement of JSW from the MTP view is more reproducible than from the SEV view, the MTP view gives a slightly lower measurement of JSW, and there is no advantage in using either view in recording osteophyte grade. We recommend the wider adoption of the MTP method. © British Society for Rheumatology 2004; all rights reserved.",Excluded
1168,"Damage-induced apoptosis in primary human lymphocytes is a genetic program modified by gender and age Apoptosis is a core pathway deregulated in hematologic and other cancers. Although there are considerable functional and genetic data on the regulation of apoptosis in vitro and in model organisms, little is known about how these pathways are modified in primary cells freshly isolated from people, who are continually subjected to a variety of different and often unquantified environmental stimuli. We hypothesize that these exposures may have important and as yet unappreciated modifying effects on apoptosis that may have implications for cancer risk or response to therapy. To test this, we isolated peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from 90 normal healthy individuals and treated them with 5 Gy ionizing radiation (IR). Damage-induced apoptosis was measured at 24 hours after IR by TUNEL. We observed surprising heterogeneity in apoptosis among individuals, ranging from 21-65 percent. To determine whether this diversity in response was programmed or stochastic, we repeated the experiment 3 times in 10 individuals spanning the entire IR-induced apoptotic range and found results to be completely reproducible within individuals, suggesting that it resulted from a genetic program. We then assessed the association with individual characteristics. Whereas neither race nor age was associated with IR-induced apoptosis, gender was significantly associated (Mean: 44.8% vs 32.9%; p = 1.02 x 10-8). Moreover, when stratified by gender, age was significantly associated with IR-induced apoptosis in males (p = 0.026) but not females (p = 0.94). Thus, we conclude that IR-induced apoptosis in freshly isolated human PBMCs results from an intrinsic genetic program modified by age, but only within males. Genetic models to explain this will be discussed.",Included
515,"Life on mars from a Self-Determination Theory perspective: How astronauts' needs for autonomy, competence and relatedness go hand in hand with crew health and mission success - Results from HI-SEAS IV With the advent of long-duration interplanetary space missions, astronauts face new psychological challenges never observed before. Grounded in Self-Determination Theory, the objective of the present research was to study how astronauts' basic psychological needs relate to astronaut well-being and mission success, and how Mission Support could foster astronaut need satisfaction. Specifically, we examined how weekly ups and downs in astronauts' need for autonomy, competence and relatedness related to week-to-week fluctuations in a set of positive (i.e., self-endorsed motivation to follow operating procedures, cooperation with Mission Support members, happiness and performance) and negative outcomes (i.e., oppositional defiance towards operating procedures, irritation with Mission Support members and stress) during the Mars simulation HI-SEAS mission 4. Additionally, we examined whether variations in astronauts' needs could be predicted by variations in Mission Support's communication style in interacting with the crew. The study comprised six volunteers, three women and three men, between 25 and 36 years of age (M = 30, SD = 4). The HI-SEAS IV mission simulated a yearlong stay on Mars. During the simulation, measures of autonomy, competence, relatedness with crewmembers and loved-ones at home, well-being, motivation, crew-ground interactions and performance were taken on a weekly basis. The data were analyzed using multilevel analyses. Overall, results indicated significant decreases in the experiences of autonomy as well as relatedness with both crewmembers and loved-ones at home, which aggravated as the mission progressed. Weekly experiences of all three need satisfactions, but in particular autonomy and relatedness with fellow crewmembers, were found to relate positively to weekly variations in self-endorsed motivation, cooperation, happiness and performance, and negatively to weekly variations in oppositional defiance, irritation, and stress. Moreover, week-to-week fluctuations in an autonomy-supportive communication style from Mission Support were found to relate positively, and a controlling style negatively, to weekly fluctuations in the crew's experience of autonomy, competence, and relatedness with crewmembers. Implications for future studies and human spaceflight are discussed. 2019 IAA",Excluded
437,"Higher radiation dose with a shorter treatment duration improves outcome for locally carcinoma of anal canal Aim: To assess whether radiation dose and duration of treatment influence local control and survival of patients with locally advanced anal cancer treated with definitive chemoradiation. Method(s): Twenty-eight consecutive patients who were treated with definitive radiation therapy for bulky anal cancers (> 5 cm in size) were reviewed. Nineteen patients had T3 lesions, 8 patients had T4 lesions, and 15 patients had lymph node involvement. The median tumor size was 7.5 cm. All but one patient received concurrent chemoradiation. The median radiation dose was 54 Gy. The median duration of treatment was 58 d. Result(s): With a median follow-up of 2.5 years in all patients and 7.8 years in living patients, the 2-year local recurrence-free probability was 57% and overall survival rate was 67%. Neither radiation dose nor duration of treatment alone was predictive of either time to local failure or overall survival. However, longer treatment breaks can potentially mask an advantage over higher radiation doses. Therefore, we examined those patients who received >= 54 Gy within 60 d, comparing them to the rest of the patients. Of patients who received >=, 54 Gy within 60 d, local progression-free probability was 89% versus 42% for the rest of the group (P = 0.01). Conclusion(s): Local failure is a significant problem in locally advanced carcinomas of the anal canal. Higher radiation doses with limited treatment breaks may offer an increase in local control and survival. © 2007 The WJG Press. All rights reserved.",Excluded

726,"Photochemical repair of Achilles tendon rupture in a rat model Background. Photochemical tissue bonding (PTB) is an emerging technique for bonding or sealing tissue surfaces that requires light and a photoactive dye for its effect. The potential of PTB for tendon repair was assessed in a rat model. Materials and methods. The optical properties of bovine tendon were determined ex vivo to gauge the depth of light penetration as a function of wavelength and dosimetry parameters were established for PTB repair of ruptured tendon. PTB was then tested in vivo to repair transected tendons in Sprague-Dawley rats. Repair strengths were measured using a strain gauge up to 14 days post treatment. Results. The effective penetration depth in tendon was estimated to be 0.68 mm at 514 nm. Following PTB treatment of mechanically ruptured tendon, significant bonding was dependent on the presence of both light and dye and attained a plateau strength at a fluence of 125 J/cm2. In a subsequent in vivo study to investigate PTB for repair of transected rat Achilles tendon, the ultimate stress required to break the repaired tendon was measured immediately after irradiation and at 7 and 14 days post-repair. Results showed that the difference in the ultimate stress between control and PTB treatment groups was statistically significant immediately after treatment and at 7 days (p = 0.04) but not 14 days (p = 0.75) post-repair. Conclusions. PTB provides a benefit to tendon repair at early stages in repair and is worthy of further investigation as a potential surgical adjunct for tendon repair in orthopedic surgeries. © 2005 Elsevier Inc.

Expression of Epstein-Barr virus gene products will affect the radiosensitivity of the cancer cells. Here, the association between EBV BamH1-A rightward transcript 7 microRNA (ebv-miR-BART7) and the effects on irradiation sensitivity was explored. Methods Tissue ebv-miR-BART7 expression level was quantified using real-time quantitative PCR. The radiosensitivity of nasopharyngeal carcinoma cells with ebv-miR-BART7 expression was evaluated by colony formation assay, cell proliferation assay, apoptosis assay, H2AX phosphorylation staining and acridine orange staining. In addition, xenograft model was developed using zebrafish embryo to validate the in vivo radiation sensitivity of the ebv-miR-BART7-expressing NPC. Results Primary NPC tissues and recurrent NPC tissues had a significant higher ebv-miR-BART7 level in comparison with the corresponding normal counterparts. ebv-miR-BART7-expressing NPC cells had higher sensitivity to irradiation treatment. Conclusion Our results suggested that NPC patients have an elevated ebv-miR-BART expression in the primary NPC and recurrent NPC tissue. High ebv-miR-BART increases the sensitivity of NPC cells to irradiation treatment. Further investigation on the clinical value of ebv-miR-BART7 to the therapeutic response is warranted to evaluate the potential use of ebv-miR-BART7 as molecular biomarker in monitoring NPC patients.",Included

The half apron was positioned at the X-ray tube or image receptor side of an anthropomorphic phantom for PA and lateral projections. Radiation dose at positions corresponding to ovaries, uterus and testes was measured with thermoluminescent dosemeters. The wrap-around apron offers a higher level of protection for PA and lateral projections compared with the half apron, regardless of where the latter was positioned, with dose reductions of up to 88% compared with no apron. For the PA position, the half apron should be positioned in a gender-specific way, facing the X-ray tube for females and the image receptor for males. With all apron types/positions, gonadal dose is still clearly evident, from internal scatter, emphasising the importance of other protective practices such as collimation.",Excluded
514,"Hypofractionated stereotactic radiotherapy for the treatment of brain metastases BACKGROUND: This retrospective review evaluated the efficacy and toxicity profiles of various dose fractionations using hypofractionated stereotactic radiotherapy (HSRT) in the treatment of brain metastases. METHOD(S): Between 2004 and 2007, 36 patients with 66 brain metastases were treated with HSRT. Nine of these subjects were excluded because of the absence of post-treatment magnetic resonance imaging scans, resulting in 27 patients with a total of 52 lesions. Of these 52 lesions, 45 lesions were treated with whole-brain radiotherapy plus a HSRT boost and 7 lesions were treated with HSRT as the primary treatment. The median prescribed dose was 25 grays (Gy) (range, 20 Gy-36 Gy) with a median of 5 fractions (range, 4 fractions-6 fractions) to a median 85% isodose line (range, 50%-100%). The median follow-up interval was 6.6 months (range, 0.9 months-26.8 months). RESULT(S): The median overall survival time was 10.8 months, and 66.7% of patients died of disease progression. After HSRT treatment of 52 brain lesions, 13 lesions demonstrated complete responses, 12 lesions demonstrated partial responses, 22 lesions demonstrated stable disease, and 5 lesions demonstrated progressive disease. Actuarial local tumor control rates at 6 months and 1 year were 93.9% and 68.2%, respectively. Maximum tumor dimension, concurrent chemotherapy, and a tumor volume <1 cc were found to be statistically significant factors for local tumor control. One patient had a grade 3 toxicity (according to National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events). CONCLUSION(S): HSRT provides a high level of tumor control with minimal toxicity comparable to single-fraction stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS).

Quality of life and potential negative effects of this strategy have become more important. The objective of this study was to investigate the quality of life and the arm and shoulder function after the resection of superior sulcus tumours following neoadjuvant chemoradiation.METHODSPatients were selected from a thoracic surgery database. Between January 2002 and December 2010, 72 patients received trimodality treatment of whom 39 were alive at the start of this study in 2010. The following arm function tests were used: nine-hole peg test, range of motion test and action research arm test. Quality of life was assessed using the Disability of the arm and shoulder and SF-36 questionnaires. Analyses of the arm function were conducted comparing the treated side with the untreated side. For quality of life, patients treated on their dominant side were compared with those treated on their non-dominant side.RESULTSIn total, 19 patients participated in this study (15 men and 4 women). The median age was 59 years (range 39-73), median radiation dose 50 Gy (range 39-66) and median follow-up 40 months (range 4-101). There was no statistically significant difference in arm and shoulder function between the treated and the untreated arm. However, statistically significantly less pain was found if patients were treated on their dominant side.CONCLUSIONSAfter the resection of SSTs following chemoradiotherapy, the arm and shoulder function on the affected side is comparable with the functions at the contralateral side. Patients treated for an SST on their dominant side are less affected in their quality of life regarding pain compared with those treated on their non-dominant side. © 2012 The Author.",Excluded
449,"Capecitabine in postoperative radiochemotherapy for gastric adenocarcinoma Background: More than 50% of new gastric cancer patients are diagnosed with unresectable disease. In 50-80% of patients who underwent radical resection, locoregional recurrence is observed. It has been proved that postoperative radiochemotherapy with 5-fluorouracil and leucovorin significantly improves the treatment outcome. The treatment with oral fluoropyrimidines, such as capecitabine, appears to be more comfortable for patients, because there is no need for any invasive procedures. Method(s): In the period from October 2006 to December 2009, 95 patients (64 males, 31 females; aged 26-78 years, mean age 58.9 years) were treated for adenocarcinoma of non-cardial gastric cancer with postoperative chemoradiation with capecitabine. All patients had locally and/or regionally advanced disease, stages Ib-IIIc. Distal subtotal resection of the stomach was performed in 46.3%, total resection in 50.5% and multivisceral resection in 3.2% of patients. Radical (R0) resection was performed in 95.8% of patients and 4.2% of patients underwent non-radical (R1) surgery. In 44.2% patients, the tumor was staged as pT3 or pT4, and 77.9% patients had N+ disease. Chemotherapy included peroral capecitabine in the dose of 1250 mg/m2 bid on days 1-14 followed by a one week break. During irradiation patients took capecitabine in the dose of 825 mg/m2 bid. After radiotherapy was completed the patients received three more cycles of capecitabine in the dose of 1250 mg/m2 bid on days 1-14 with a one week break between each cycle. 3-D conformal radiotherapy at a daily dose of 1.8 Gy and total irradiation dose of 45 Gy was delivered on linear accelerator with 15MV photon beams for 5 days per week. The main endpoints of this study were loco-regional control, disease-free survival, disease-specific survival and overall survival. The rates of acute side-effects were also estimated. Result(s): Seventy-six percent of patients completed the treatment according to the protocol. In 4% of the patients the total irradiation dose was lower than intended and 24% of patients did not receive all cycles of chemotherapy. No death occurred due to the therapy. Acute toxicity, such as nausea and vomiting, stomatitis, diarrhea, hand-foot syndrome and infections of grade 3 or 4 occurred in 5.3%, 1.1%, 2.1%, 7.4% and 19% of patients, respectively. Despite intensive nutritional support during the treatment the weight loss was observed in 58.4% of patients. The median follow-up time for all 95 patients was 4 years (range: 0.4-6.3 years), whereas in survivors it was 4.8 years (range: 3.4-6.3 years). On the close-out date, 63% patients were still alive, all of them without any signs of the disease. Thirty percent of patients died from gastric carcinoma, 5% died from other causes and in 2% the cause of death could not be determined. After adjuvant radiochemotherapy, recurrence was observed in 31.6% of patients: local and/or regional recurrence in 4.2% of patients and systemic disease alone in 27.4% of patients. The 5 years LRC, DFS, DSS and OS were 93.1%, 67%, 68.6%, and 62.2%, respectively. Conclusion(s): Postoperative radiochemotherapy with capecitabine is feasible, with low toxicity and the results of such treatment are good.",Excluded
542,"A phase I/II trial of intensity modulated radiation (IMRT) dose escalation with concurrent fixed-dose rate gemcitabine (FDR-G) in patients with unresectable pancreatic cancer Purpose: Local failure in unresectable pancreatic cancer may contribute to death. We hypothesized that intensification of local therapy would improve local control and survival. The objectives were to determine the maximum tolerated radiation dose delivered by intensity modulated radiation with fixed-dose rate gemcitabine (FDR-G), freedom from local progression (FFLP), and overall survival (OS). Methods and Materials: Eligibility included pathologic confirmation of adenocarcinoma, radiographically unresectable, performance status of 0-2, absolute neutrophil count of >=1500/mm3, platelets >=100,000/mm3, creatinine <2 mg/dL, bilirubin <3 mg/dL, and alanine aminotransferase/aspartate aminotransferase <=2.5 x upper limit of normal. FDR-G (1000 mg/m2/100 min intravenously) was given on days -22 and -15, 1, 8, 22, and 29. Intensity modulated radiation started on day 1. Dose levels were escalated from 50-60 Gy in 25 fractions. Dose-limiting toxicity was defined as gastrointestinal toxicity grade (G) >=3, neutropenic fever, or deterioration in performance status to >=3 between day 1 and 126. Dose level was assigned using TITE-CRM (Time-to-Event Continual Reassessment Method) with the target dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) rate set to 0.25. Result(s): Fifty patients were accrued. DLTs were observed in 11 patients: G3/4 anorexia, nausea, vomiting, and/or dehydration (7); duodenal bleed (3); duodenal perforation (1). The recommended dose is 55 Gy, producing a probability of DLT of 0.24. The 2-year FFLP is 59% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 32-79). Median and 2-year overall survival are 14.8 months (95% CI: 12.6-22.2) and 30% (95% CI 17-45). Twelve patients underwent resection (10 R0, 2 R1) and survived a median of 32 months. Conclusion(s): High-dose radiation therapy with concurrent FDR-G can be delivered safely. The encouraging efficacy data suggest that outcome may be improved in unresectable patients through intensification of local therapy. © 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.",Excluded
1100,"Non-coherent light sources in the blue range of the spectrum for treating streptostaphylodermias Purpose: To determine possibilities of photodynamic therapy (PDT) with non-coherent light sources in the blue range of the spectrum for treating streptostaphylodermias. Previously performed microbiological and spectrophotometric studies andexperimental work with animals have helped the author to choose photosensitisers and light sources for the present clinical trials. Material(s) and Method(s): PDT was done in 62-patients with superficial forms of streptostaphylodermias (28 men and-34 women) aged 17-58. In the control group there were 58 patients (27 men and 31 women) who had traditional therapy. In PDT treatment 1% gel of photosensitizer Photoditazin was applied at skin lesions one hour before irradiation. Light-emitting diode therapeutic apparatus ""AST"" (registration number FSR-2008/02720) generating light at the range 400-410nm (in the Sore band), power 500 mWt was used as a light source. 3 sessions a week, irradiation time 5-7 min at 5 cm distance. Results were assessed by changes in clinical picture, by biophotometric findings (with biophotometer ""Milta-08 1""). Changes were also fixed by a photocamera. Result(s): During the trial complete regression of skin rash was seen in 81% patients, considerable improvement in 27.5%; no changes in 11% after 4-8 PDT sessions (1.5-2.5 weeks after treatment beginning); in the control group 18%, 59% and 62%, correspondently. These findings have been confirmed by biophotometric examinations of the diseased areas on the skin: in the studied group reduction of a coefficient of reflection from the skin surface by 39%, reduction of a coefficient of reflection from deep skin layers by-23%; in the control group by 27% and 17%, correspondently. It has confirmed effectiveness and perspectiveness of the developed PDT technique. No recurrences were seen during 12 months in 75% of the studied group and in 21% in the control group. Conclusion(s): PDT with photosensitizers of the chlorin raw for treating streptostaphylodermias allows to get considerably better improvement in patient's state and remissions than in traditional treatment.",Excluded
1097,"Dose-response relations for stricture in the proximal oesophagus from head and neck radiotherapy BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Determination of the dose-response relations for oesophageal stricture after radiotherapy of the head and neck., MATERIAL AND METHODS: In this study 33 patients who developed oesophageal stricture and 39 patients as controls are included. The patients received radiation therapy for head and neck cancer at Karolinska University Hospital, Stockholm, Sweden. For each patient the 3D dose distribution delivered to the upper 5 cm of the oesophagus was analysed. The analysis was conducted for two periods, 1992-2000 and 2001-2005, due to the different irradiation techniques used. The fitting has been done using the relative seriality model., RESULTS: For the treatment period 1992-2005, the mean doses were 49.8 and 33.4 Gy, respectively, for the cases and the controls. For the period 1992-2000, the mean doses for the cases and the controls were 49.9 and 45.9 Gy and for the period 2001-2005 were 49.8 and 21.4 Gy. For the period 2001-2005 the best estimates of the dose-response parameters are D(50)=61.5 Gy (52.9-84.9 Gy), gamma=1.4 (0.8-2.6) and s=0.1 (0.01-0.3)., CONCLUSIONS: Radiation-induced strictures were found to have a dose response relation and volume dependence (low relative seriality) for the treatment period 2001-2005. However, no dose response relation was found for the complete material. Copyright © 2010 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.",Excluded

613,"Does Exposure to Computed Tomography Contrast Media Increase Risk of End-Stage Renal Disease? BACKGROUND There are many studies on acute kidney injury (AKI) after exposure to contrast media in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD). However, whether the risk of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) increases after exposure to contrast media in the long term, regardless of development of AKI after such exposure, has not been studied. MATERIAL AND METHODS The electronic health records of patients diagnosed with CKD and followed up from 2014 to 2018 at a tertiary university hospital were retrospectively collected. Patients were divided into patients who progressed to ESRD (ESRD group) and those who did not (non-ESRD group). Patients in the non-ESRD group were matched 1: 1 to those in the ESRD group by using disease risk score generation and matching. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was performed to assess the effect of contrast media exposure on progression to ESRD. RESULTS In total, 179 patients were enrolled per group; 178 (99.4%) were in CKD stage 3 or above in both groups. Average serum creatinine was 4.31+/-3.02 mg/dl and 3.64+/-2.55 mg/dl in the ESRD and non-ESRD groups, respectively (p=0.242). Other baseline characteristics were not statistically significant, except for the number of times contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CECT) was performed (0.00 [Interquartile range (IQR) 0.00-2.00] in the ESRD group and 0.00 [IQR 0.00-1.00] in the non-ESRD group [p=0.006]); in multivariate logistic regression, this number (OR=1.24, 95% CI=1.08-1.47, p=0.006) was significantly related to progression to ESRD. CONCLUSIONS The use of CECT increased the risk of ESRD 1.2-fold in advanced and stable CKD outpatients after 5-year follow-up.",Excluded
883,"Phase I/IIa PET imaging study with 89zirconium labeled anti-PSMA minibody for urological malignancies OBJECTIVE: We conducted the present phase I/IIa positron emission tomography (PET) imaging study with 89Zr conjugated with desferroxamine-IAB2M (89Zr-Df-IAB2M), an anti-prostate-specific membrane-antigen minibody, to assess its safety and feasibility in patients with urological cancer., METHODS: 89Zr-Df-IAB2M was synthetized by IBA Molecular (Somerset, NJ, USA) and transported by air to Tsukuba Molecular Imaging Center (Tsukuba, Ibaraki, Japan). 17 patients received 74 MBq (2 mCi) of 89Zr-Df-IAB2M at total mass doses of 10 mg. Whole-body and plasma clearance, normal-organ and lesion uptake, and radiation absorbed dose were estimated. We also preliminarily tested the performance of 89Zr-immuno-PET imaging for 13 patients with prostate cancer and 4 patients with other urological cancer., RESULTS: The administration of 89Zr-Df-IAB2M was well-tolerated, and no infusion-related reactions were observed in any patient. No adverse events were noted in the laboratory parameters, vital signs, or other parameters. The plasma clearance was biphasic, with an initial rapid phase (t 1/2 fast: 10.1 +/- 3.4 h) followed by a slow phase (t 1/2 slow: 49.0 +/- 22.7 h). The half-life of radioactivity in the whole body (WB t1/2) was 237 +/- 9 h. The highest absorbed radiation dose was 1.67 mGy/MBq, observed in the liver and kidney. The effective dose was 0.68 +/- 0.08 mSv/MBq. The radiation dose rate at 0.5 m distance from the patient was 8.67 microSv/h on day 1, and decreased to 2.26 microSv/h at 5 days after injection. Both bone and lymph node metastases were detected with 89Zr-Df-IAB2M by 24 or 48 h imaging., CONCLUSIONS: Administration of 89Zr-Df-IAB2M was well-tolerated and safe in terms of adverse events and radiation exposure and protection. 89Zr-Df-IAB2M is feasible for usage by long-distance transportation. Further studies are warranted for analysis of its use for tumor lesion detection (UMIN000015356).",Excluded
416,"Gravity and Mastoid Effusion BACKGROUND: Asymptomatic mastoid effusions have recently been observed in astronauts returning from long-term spaceflight. In hospitalized patients, mastoid effusion increases the risks for bacterial otitis and mastoiditis. We reasoned that cephalad fluid shifts during strict -6degree head down tilt bed rest could reproduce space-flight associated mastoid effusion and that artificial gravity may reverse the response., METHODS: The recent Artificial Gravity Bed Rest Study-European Space Agency study (AGBRESA) tested influences of artificial gravity during 60 days head down bed rest on a short-arm human centrifuge in healthy participants. The two intervention groups received daily artificial gravity with 30 minutes continuous artificial gravity or intermittent artificial gravity. A third group served as a control group and received no artificial gravity. We assessed cranial magnetic resonance images for mastoid effusions 1 day before bed rest, at days 14 and 52 of bed rest, and 3 days after bed rest., RESULTS: None of the participants exhibited mastoid effusions before bed rest. Six participants showed mastoid effusions at bed rest day 14 (4 continuous, 2 intermittent, 0 control). Fifteen participants showed mastoid effusions at bed rest day 52 and 3 days after bed rest (7 continuous, 3 intermittent, 5 control)., CONCLUSIONS: Mastoid effusions commonly occur during strict head down tilt bed rest. The model can be applied to study the mechanisms and potential countermeasures for space flight-associated mastoid effusions. Formation of mastoid effusions during head down tilt bed rest is not prevented by daily 30 minutes short-arm intermittent or continuous centrifugation. Copyright © 2020 Elsevier Inc.

31,"Chromosome aberrations induced by tritiated water or 60Co gamma-rays at early pronuclear stage in mouse eggs The induction of chromosome aberrations in mouse eggs by exposure to HTO beta-particles and 60Co gamma-rays at the early pronuclear stage was examined at the first-cleavage metaphase by using an in vitro fertilization technique. Eggs at the pronuclear stage were exposed to beta-particles in a chemically defined medium containing tritiated water (HTO) for 2 h at 3-5 h after insemination. Other eggs at the same stage were exposed to gamma-rays from 60Co during the same period. The dose-response relationships for frequencies of chromosome aberrations per egg were fitted to a linear-quadratic model for HTO beta-particles, and to a linear model for 60Co gamma-rays. The chromosome aberrations were mainly chromosome-type, and the majority of all aberrations were fragments. RBE values of HTO beta-particles relative to 60Co gamma-rays and acute X-rays, which were estimated from the ratio of the linear regression coefficients over 0.05-Gy range, were 2.0 and 1.6, respectively.",Excluded

523,"Radiosurgery as treatment for acoustic neuroma. Ten years' experience INTRODUCTION AND OBJECTIVE: The acoustic neuroma is a benign tumour that usually affects the vestibular portion of the vestibulocochlear nerve. It represents 8% of all intracranial tumours and 80% of those arising at the cerebellopontine angle. There are 3 treatment options: microsurgery (the technique of choice), radiosurgery and observation. The objective of the study was to evaluate the results and side effects obtained using radiosurgery as treatment for acoustic neuroma.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: We performed a review of all patients treated with radiosurgery (Gamma Knife and linear accelerator) at doses of 1200-1300 cGy for unilateral acoustic neuroma in our hospital from January 1999 until January 2010. In all patients we evaluated the overall state, tumour growth control rate (tumour smaller or remaining the same size), the involvement of v and vii cranial nerves and central nervous system disorders. We also assessed follow-up time and changes in hearing thresholds after radiosurgery.
RESULTS: From a total of 35 patients studied, with a mean age of 58.29 years and lacking statistically significant differences in gender, the tumour growth control rate was over 90%. The main reason for visit (65.71%) was unilateral and progressive hearing loss. After treatment, 34.28% of patients had hearing loss. The involvement of the cranial nerves (v-vii) was transitory in 100% of cases. Gamma Knife radiosurgery was administered in 82.85% of patients.
CONCLUSION: Although microsurgery is the treatment of choice for acoustic neuroma, we consider radiosurgery as a valid alternative in selected patients (elderly, comorbidity, small tumour size and sensorineural hearing loss, among others).",Excluded

The scan sequence of group A included conventional scan first, then enhanced scan in arterial phase, parenchyma phase and excretion delayed phase after the injection of 100 mL contrast agent. The scan sequence of group B included conventional scan and enhanced scan following two bolus injection of contrast; the first injection of contrast was 40 mL, the second injection was 60 mL with 15-30 minutes delay, then enhanced scan was conducted in arterial and parenchymal phase, the parenchymal phase scan was performed with dual energy scanning sequence. The image quality of urinary collecting system, the detection of urinary obstructive lesion, and radiation dose were compared between the two groups., RESULTS: Between the two imaging methods, the imaging quality of urinary system did not show significant difference, but radiation dose was statistically significant difference. The radiation dose of split-bolus 2-phase with virtual non-enhanced scan was only 55% of traditional CTU scan., CONCLUSION: Split-bolus2 phase with virtual non-enhanced scan could obtain the same image quality as tranditional CTU, while reducing the approximately half the radiation dose.",Excluded
1199,"What do we know about ALARA? Is our knowledge sufficient about radiation safety? BACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to determine the knowledge of neurosurgeons and emergency physicians about ALARA (as low as reasonably achievable) and to gain awareness to them about this topic., METHODS: A multiple-choice survey comprising 17 questions was performed to 30 neurosurgeons and 70 emergency room doctors., RESULTS: Emergency medicine doctors, neurosurgeons, emergency medicine residents, neurosurgery residents and general practitioners participated in the survey. Sixty-six percent of participants stated that they examined more than 50 patient with headache, dizziness and head trauma in emergency service per diem and more than half of the participants stated that brain CT was performed in the event of patient's request, even if there was not an indication. 75% of the participants stated that they requested CT scan without neurological examination when the number of patients increased in the emergency room. Eighty-three percent of the participants did not think there was a safe dose limit in CT, 92% did not know the radiation dose received during brain CT, 96% did not know the meaning of the ALARA. Fifty-seven percent of the participants stated that if they informed about the criteria of ALARA, they will take into acount these criteria while requesting CT scan., CONCLUSIONS: In our country, doctors working in emergency services request brain CT needlessly because of taking into account the patient's wish and fear of malpractice. The knowledge of the neurosurgeons and emergency service doctors about ALARA is insufficient. It is necessary to educate our physicians about ALARA protocol, for taking these criteria into their consideration when requesting CT examination. For protecting the patients from the effects of ionizing radiation and reducing the economic loss of hospitals, it is necessary to increase awareness of the ALARA protocol and to increase the number of hospitals which protocol is applied.",Excluded
1150,"Balloon-sacroplasty on patients with osteoporotic fatigue fractures Introduction In patients with calcipenic osteopathy, fatigue fractures of the Os sacrum are relatively common and are typically accompanied by strong, disabling pain. The aim of our study was to verify the feasibility and safety of Sacroplasty by using a balloon catheter as well as the outcome of pain after the intervention. Material(s) and Method(s): 25 patients (20 women with an average age of 72.6 years, 5 men with an average age of 68.4 years) were diagnosed in a CT to have an Os sacrum fracture, in 12 women the fracture was unilateral, in the remaining patients bilateral. As a manifestation from an extant bone reconstruction process, all patients, through MRT strong T2 weighted images, were found to have distinctive oedema. In QCT results, all patients were found to have strong demineralisation of the vertebrae column with results from max 63mg/dl to min 13mg/dl, clinically, extreme pain is significant. On all patients, a CT controlled balloon sacroplasty was performed. During the intervention, the patient is in a ventral position, to enable the cement to be dispensed in a longitudinal angle to the fracture, and the balloon catheter is directed through a hollow needle in the Os sacrum either from the caudal to the cranial or from the craniodorsal to the caudoventral. The balloon catheter was accordingly de/inflated 1-3 times along the fracture in the appropriate direction, thus causing a cavity that was then filled with PMMA-cement under low pressure. A control-CT as well as a conventional X-ray was then carried out. The pain intensity was defined by means of VAS before the intervention, on the second day, after 6 and 12 months. Result(s): The balloon-sacroplasty enabled a good technical performance on every patient. The control-CT and the X-Ray control of the Os sacrum showed an adequate distribution of the cement, a cement leakage was not detected. Before the operation, the average pain encountered was according to the VAS 8.3. On the second postoperative day, a considerable reduction with an average of 2.7 was reported, this was still stable with an average of 2.5 after 6 and 12 months. Discussion(s): The Balloon-Sacroplasty is an effective treatment method for immediate pain relief and remobilisation in patients with fatigue fractures of the Os sacrum. Different approches as well as the utilisation of a balloon enables preferably large cement streams in the longitudinal direction of the fracture in the Os sacrums.",Excluded

Methods and Materials: LS-SCLC patients that had been treated with chemoradiotherapy between 1997 and 2007 at Aichi Cancer Center Hospital were reviewed in this study. Of the 127 eligible patients, there were 37 patients in the AHF group, 29 in the SF <54 Gy group, and 61 in the SF >=54 Gy group. Result(s): Fifty-five patients (43%) were alive at the time of this analysis, and the median follow-up time of the surviving patients was 33 months. The median survival times were 30.0 months (95% confidence interval [CI] 16.3-43.7) for the AHF group, 14.0 months (CI 6.6-21.4) for the SF <54 Gy group, and 41.0 months (CI 33.9-48.1) for the SF >= 54 Gy group. As for the local control rates, and the overall and progression-free survival rates, all outcomes were significantly lower in the SF <54 Gy group than in the other two groups, although no significant difference was found between the AHF and SF >=54 Gy groups. Conclusion(s): These results suggest the importance of a high dose of radiation when using once-daily regimen. This study will support future prospective studies to establish optimal radiation doses and fractionation. © 2010 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.",Excluded
319,"miRNA-95 mediates radioresistance in tumors by targeting the sphingolipid phosphatase SGPP1 Radiation resistance poses a major clinical challenge in cancer treatment, but little is known about how microRNA (miR) may regulate this phenomenon. In this study, we used next-generation sequencing to perform an unbiased comparison of miR expression in PC3 prostate cancer cells rendered resistant to fractionated radiation treatment. One miR candidate found to be upregulated by ionizing radiation was miR-95, the enforced expression of which promoted radiation resistance in a variety of cancer cells. miR-95 overexpression recapitulated an aggressive phenotype including increased cellular proliferation, deregulated G2-M checkpoint following ionizing radiation, and increased invasive potential. Using combined in silico prediction and microarray expression analyses, we identified and validated the sphingolipid phosphatase SGPP1, an antagonist of sphingosine-1-phosphate signaling, as a target of miR-95 that promotes radiation resistance. Consistent with this finding, cell treatment with FTY720, a clinically approved small molecule inhibitor of S1P signaling, sensitized miR-95 overexpressing cells to radiation treatment. In vivo assays extended the significance of these results, showing that miR-95 overexpression increased tumor growth and resistance to radiation treatment in tumor xenografts. Furthermore, reduced tumor necrosis and increased cellular proliferation were seen after radiation treatment of miR-95 overexpressing tumors compared with control tumors. Finally, miR-95 expression was increased in human prostate and breast cancer specimens compared with normal tissue. Together, our work reveals miR-95 expression as a critical determinant of radiation resistance in cancer cells.",Included
1033,"Platelet-rich plasma as a potential therapeutic approach against lead nitrate- and/or gamma radiation-induced hepatotoxicity Because of the potential regenerative and cytoprotective effects of its content of numerous bioactive growth factors and cytokines, platelet-rich plasma (PRP) became an attractive biomaterial for therapeutic purposes. Therefore, the current study was designed to investigate the potential therapeutic effect of PRP against lead nitrate- and/or gamma-radiation-induced hepatotoxicity. To do so, hepatotoxicity was induced in rats by intraperitoneal administration of lead nitrate (7.5 mg/kg) thrice weekly for two consecutive weeks and/or a whole-body gamma-irradiation at a single dose of 6 Gy. Activated PRP (0.5 ml/kg) was injected subcutaneously 24 h after the last dose of lead nitrate and/or gamma-irradiation and continued twice weekly for three successive weeks. Lead nitrate intoxication and/or gamma-irradiation resulted in a significant elevation of serum alanine transaminase and aspartate transaminase activities accompanied with a significant decrease in serum levels of total protein and albumin. Further, a significant increase in malondialdehyde level and nitric oxide content accompanied with a significant decrease in the reduced glutathione content and the enzyme activities of glutathione-S-transferase, superoxide dismutase, and catalase were observed. Additionally, hepatic extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) and Akt signaling pathways were stimulated. PRP treatment notably ameliorated the induced cell injury, reduced the intracellular oxidative and interestingly increased the upregulation of phosphorylated ERK1/2 and Akt. Moreover, PRP treatment relieved lead nitrate and/or gamma-radiation-induced hepatic histological damages. In conclusion, this study sheds the light on a probable therapeutic role of PRP against lead nitrate- and/or gamma-radiation-induced hepatotoxicity which might attribute to its ability to activate ERK and Akt signaling pathways.",Excluded
1226,"Estimation of left ventricular ejection fraction with low-dose gated tomographic radionuclide angiography using cadmium-zinc-telluride gamma camera in patients receiving cardio-toxic chemotherapy: A dramatic radiation reduction Background: Tomographic radionuclide angiography (TRA) is a simple non-invasive procedure which can monitor left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) with automatic processing software, resulting in excellent reproducibility. New gamma cameras using cadmium-zinc-telluride (CZT) detectors enables reduction of the patient radiation dose. We compared LVEF and left ventricular (LV) volumes between low dose and standarddose TRA using a CZT camera. Method(s): Between September and December 2015, patients receiving potentially cardiotoxic chemotherapy and undergoing TRA were consecutively included. CZT acquisition was performed in <> after injection of 550MBq 99mTclabelled human serum albumin and lasted 7 minutes (recommended activity: 550-1110MBq, Society of Nuclear Medicine Guidelines). Each acquisition was analyzed full dose and equivalent half dose by the same physician, using the same software (Quantitative Blood Pool SPECT, Cedars Sinai) to generate LVEF and LV volumes. Result(s): 80 patients were analyzed (40% male, mean age 60 years and BMI 28 kg/m2). There was no significant difference in LVEF and LV systolic and diastolic volumes between full dose and equivalent half dose acquisition (p< 0.005). The contrasttonoise ratio wasn't visually decreased. Effective dose were 3.3 millisieverts (mSv) and 1.65mSv respectively for fulldose and equivalent halfdose acquisitions using our parameters. Conclusion(s): LVEF and LV volumes can accurately be determined using fast low-dose CZT acquisition (7 minutes, < 2mSv, below natural radiation) in patients receiving cardio-toxic chemotherapy. This dose reduction up to 50% from the lowest recommended administered activity allows repeated scans in those patients, with reduced dosimetry. Further dose reductions may be achievable.",Excluded
866,"Bone Marrow Transplantation Induces Normoglycemia in a Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus Murine Model Objective: To study the cellular mechanisms involved in the regression of diabetic nephropathy, bone marrow-derived cells must be identified. The aim of this study was to obtain a diabetic chimeric model with bone marrow cells expressing enhanced green fluorecence protein (EGFP), without modifying the course of diabetic nephropathy. Material(s) and Method(s): Bone marrow transplantation (BMT) was performed in an obese type 2 diabetic murine model (db/db) owing to a mutation in the leptin receptor gene. Whole bone marrow from female donor C57BL/6 EGFP+ mice was transplanted into 8-week-old C57BL/6 mice and into 8- and 24-week-old female C57BLKS (db/db) EGFP- mice. Recipient mice received total body irradiation (TBI) followed by bone marrow (BM) cell infusion. We tested various irradiation doses (Gy) and numbers of BM cells. Result(s): When a low TBI dose and a small number of BM cells were administered, only syngeneic C57BL/6 mice became chimeric, whereas allogeneic db/db mice showed rejection. When Gy dose and BM cells were increased, db/db mice became chimeric. However, 8-week-old db/db mice lost the obese phenotype and became normoglycemic, probably due to peripheral BM cell infiltration. Conversely, 24-week-old db/db mice remained obese showing similar blood glucose values, body weights, albuminuria, and glomerular lesions at nontransplanted db/db mice. Conclusion(s): Recipient age greatly influenced the peripheral repopulation after BMT in db/db mice. Only the adult chimeric db/db mice seemed to be a good model to study the cellular mechanisms involved in the regression of diabetic nephropathy. © 2009 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.",Excluded
946,"Enhancement of synaptic strength in the somatosensory cortex following nerve injury does not parallel behavioural alterations Following infraorbital nerve transection, underlying mechanisms of the altered synaptic strength were studied in rat barrel cortex slice experiments. In addition to the in vitro electrophysiological studies, open-field tests were run to detect possible behavioural changes associated with cortical oversensitization. Enhanced NMDA receptor-mediated component of the evoked field response appeared in the barrel cortex after nerve injury. The alteration was transient, very distinct on the first day following injury, and almost returned to normal level by the end of the second week. Behavioural changes had not followed this time-course since long-lasting alterations were detected in the open-field test. These observations are in agreement with findings that showed biphasic regenerative processes following nerve injuries in other cortical areas.",Excluded
599,"BRAF exon 15 T1799A mutation is common in melanocytic nevi, but less prevalent in cutaneous malignant melanoma, in Chinese Han Frequent somatic mutations of BRAF (v-raf murine sarcoma viral oncogene homolog B) exon T1799A, which are implicated in the initial events of promutagenic cellular proliferation, are detected in both malignant melanomas (MM) and melanocytic nevi (MN). Most of the data regarding BRAF exon T1799A mutation have been from Caucasian cohorts, and a comprehensive screening of a homogeneous population is lacking. A total of 379 cases of MN and 195 cases of MM were collected from Chinese Han living in three geographical regions in China, i.e., northeast, southwest, and northwest China. BRAF exon T1799A mutation was detected by PCR and sequencing from microdissected tumors. In all, 59.8% cases of MN harbored BRAF exon T1799A mutation. Samples from regions with high UV exposure had higher detection rates than regions with lower UV exposure (73.5, 67.0, and 38.9%, respectively; chi2= 31.674, P=1.59E-7). There were no differences in mutation rates between congenital and acquired MN; however, acquired MN with advanced age of onset had a higher mutation rate than those with younger age of onset (chi2=13.23, P=0.02). In all, 15.0% cases of MM harbored the BRAF mutation. The mutation rate in MM was not affected by region, histological type, gender, pattern of UV exposure, and age. The study suggests that the mutation is not necessarily associated with malignant transformation. © 2011 The Society for Investigative Dermatology.",Excluded
320,"High MUC2 immunohistochemical expression is a predictor of poor response to preoperative radiochemotherapy (RCT) in rectal adenocarcinoma The purpose of this study is to establish if mucoid differentiation is associated with responsiveness to preoperative radiochemotherapy (RCT) in rectal adenocarcinomas. Thirty-two patients with rectal adenocarcinomas were preoperatively treated with 44 to 46 Gy in 22 to 23 fractions and with 5-fluorouracil (200 to 225 mg/m) before surgery. Mucoid differentiation was searched for both in pre-RCT biopsies with anti-MUC2 antiserum and in postoperative specimens. To evaluate the responsiveness to preoperative RCT, a regression grading was used (grades 0 to 4). Statistical analysis showed a significant negative correlation between immunohistochemical expression of MUC2 in pre-RCT biopsies and regression grade in postoperative specimens (r=-0.529; P=0.002). A significant cutoff value of 60% of MUC2 positive neoplastic cells in pre-RCT biopsies was observed (P=0.018): 13 cases with more than 60% exhibited a poor response to RCT (grade 0 in 5/13, grade 1 in 4/13, grade 2 in 4/13), whereas 19 cases with less than 60% showed a better response to RCT (grade 1 in 6/19, grade 2 in 9/19, grade 3 in 3/19, grade 4 in 1/19). © 2008 Lippincott Williams & Wilkins, Inc.",Excluded
667,"Evaluation of age-related plantar-surface insensitivity and onset age of advanced insensitivity in older adults using vibratory and touch sensation tests Age-related decline in plantar-surface sensitivity has been cited as one of the reasons for balance problems in older adults. This study investigated the level of plantar-surface sensitivity in older adults compared to young adults. Additionally, this study attempted to identify the onset age of advanced insensitivity in older adults and how well monofilament testing was able to predict insensitivity and onset age of advanced insensitivity. Vibration thresholds were assessed at four frequencies (3, 25, 100 and 250 Hz) and four foot sole locations (heel, first metatarsal, fifth metatarsal and great toe). Touch thresholds were evaluated with Semmes-Weinstein monofilaments at the same four locations. Results indicated that older adults showed insensitivity to vibratory (25 and 100 Hz) and touch stimuli when compared to young adults. Vibration testing at 100 Hz indicated that early in the seventh decade (72-73 years old) participants started to show a doubling of their detection threshold as compared to their younger counterparts (65-71 years old). Regression analysis indicated a significant predictive value of the monofilaments to 100 Hz vibration thresholds, but a caution is noted that this type of testing is not as sensitive to the onset of advanced plantar-surface insensitivity. Therefore, older adults have significant plantar-surface insensitivity as compared to young adults and have an onset of advanced insensitivity in the seventh decade of life. Monofilaments are useful to assess the age-related insensitivity but are not when attempting to identify the onset of advanced insensitivity.",Excluded
79,"Combination of EGFR/HER2 tyrosine kinase inhibition by BIBW 2992 and BIBW 2669 with irradiation in FaDu human squamous cell carcinoma PURPOSE: To investigate the effect of the dual EGFR/HER2 (ErbB2) tyrosine kinase inhibitors BIBW 2992 and BIBW 2669 on proliferation and clonogenic cell survival of FaDu human squamous cell carcinoma in vitro, and on tumor growth after single-dose irradiation in nude mice., MATERIAL AND METHODS: Cell proliferation, cell-cycle distribution and clonogenic cell survival after irradiation were assayed with and without BIBW 2992 or BIBW 2669 (3, 30, and 300 nM) in vitro. Tumor volume and tumor growth delay (GD(V2)) were determined in tumors growing in NMRI (nu/nu) nude mice, treated with (a) BIBW 2992 (20 mg kg(-1) body weight orally), BIBW 2669 (3-4 mg kg(-1) body weight orally) or carrier until a final tumor diameter of 15 mm, or, (b) 3 days before a 20-Gy single-dose irradiation or, (c) after a 20-Gy single-dose irradiation until reaching the final tumor diameter., RESULTS: BIBW 2992 and BIBW 2669 significantly increased the doubling time of FaDu cells in vitro. A marked dose-dependent antiproliferative effect with blockade of the cells in G0/G1-phase of the cell cycle was found. Incubation with BIBW 2669 or BIBW 2992 for 3 days marginally increased radiosensitivity of FaDu cells in vitro. For BIBW 2992, this effect was statistically significant (p = 0.006). Daily oral application of BIBW 2669 or BIBW 2992 in mice bearing unirradiated FaDu tumors showed a marked antiproliferative effect with a significant prolongation of tumor growth delay (p < 0.0001). After drug application for 3 days, followed by 20-Gy single-dose irradiation, a slight effect of both drugs on tumor growth delay was seen. For BIBW 2669, this effect was statistically significant (p = 0.007). However, this effect disappeared when tumor volumes were normalized to the time point of irradiation suggesting that both drugs showed no or only a slight radiosensitizing effect in vivo. Daily application of BIBW 2669 or BIBW 2992 after a single-dose irradiation showed a clear inhibition of tumor growth with a significantly longer tumor growth delay after drug treatment compared to control tumors (p < 0.002). Enhancement ratios were smaller for irradiated than for unirradiated tumors, suggesting an additive effect for combinations with radiotherapy. In all treatment arms, the effects of BIBW 2669 were not significantly different from BIBW 2992., CONCLUSION: BIBW 2669 and BIBW 2992 showed a clear antiproliferative effect in vitro, whereas radiosensitization was only marginal. The present data are the first to show an effect of combined irradiation and dual EGFR/ErbB2 inhibition on tumor growth delay in vivo. Further preclinical investigations using fractionated irradiation schedules and local tumor control as experimental endpoint are needed to evaluate a possible curative potential for the combination treatment.",Excluded

Cytological examinations of these cases with regard to the vaginal epithelium had the following results: Group I:6 times; group II: 37 times; group IIW:8 times; group IIId: once; group IVa:twice. The cytological tests were carried out according to the method of papanicolaou as modified by Soost. Furthermore, we could state the following degrees of purity: Degree I: 8 times; degree II:16 times; degree III: 30 times. The cytological examinations of the urethral epithelium demonstrated, in 52 cases, an increased appearance of nude"" completely exposed epithelial cell nuclei--a fact corresponding to a degenerative autolysis (according to Wied). In the 26 women with missing atypical germ flora within the region of the exterior genitals, exclusively groups I (according to Papanicolaou and Soost) and degrees of purity I were stated.

750,"Systematic effects of surgical treatment of hip fractures: gliding screw-plating vs intramedullary nailing AIM: Numerous studies have been published regarding the comparison between intramedullary nail and the dynamic hip screw and plate for the fixation of intertrochanteric fractures in elderly patients. In this paper we present a comparative study of these two methods regarding their systemic effects on this group of patients., MATERIALS-METHODS: This is a randomized trial of 120 consecutive patients with an intertrochanteric fracture treated with either extramedullary fixation (dynamic hip screw and plate; DHS, Synthes-Stratec, Oberdorf, Switzerland) or intramedullary nail (Gamma nail, Stryker Howmedica, Freiburg, Germany and Endovis BA, Citieffe, Bologna, Italy). The parameters that we assessed pre-operatively, in addition to their demographics, included their mental state (MMSE), their nutritional and immune state and their pulmonary function. Intra-operatively we calculated the amount of radiation exposure, the amount of blood loss and the length of operative time for each procedure. Postoperatively we repeated the calculation of the mental and pulmonary state and the blood loss, during days 1, 3, and 10 and related them to the ease of the patient's mobilization., RESULTS: Decreased bleeding and post-operative pain, reduced post-operative morbidity and faster recovery of function were better but not significant in the group of intramedullary fixation (all p>0.05). However, in the same group there were slightly more patients in whom the MMSE was falling, together with their pulmonary function, suggesting that this method probably predisposes to higher chances of pulmonary dysfunction and the possibility of pulmonary embolism., CONCLUSION: We found no significant differences between the two methods of stabilization of these fractures regarding their systemic effects perioperatively. The classic dynamic hip screw can preserve its position as a safe and effective solution for these already vulnerable patients having sustained a trochanteric fracture against the novel intramedullary techniques.

326,"Radiosurgical decompression of metastatic epidural compression BACKGROUND: Surgical decompression of metastatic epidural compression (MEC) improved ambulatory function. Spine radiosurgery can accurately target the epidural tumor and deliver high radiation doses for tumor control. Therefore, a clinical trial was performed to quantitatively determine the degree of epidural decompression by radiosurgery of metastatic epidural compression. METHOD(S): Sixty-two patients with a total of 85 lesions of metastatic epidural compression were treated. Epidural compression was diagnosed by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans. Main criteria of inclusion were neurological status with muscle power 4 of 5 or better. Radiosurgery was performed to the involved spine segment, including the epidural mass with median dose of 16 Gy (range 12-20 Gy) in a single session. All patients had prospective clinical follow-up, ranging from 1-48 months (median 11.5 months), and 36 patients had pretreatment and post-treatment imaging, ranging from 2-33 months (median 9.3 months). Primary endpoints were epidural tumor control and thecal sac decompression. RESULT(S): The mean epidural tumor volume reduction was 65 +/- 14% at 2 months after radiosurgery. The epidural tumor area at the level of the most severe spinal cord compression was 0.82 +/- 0.08 cm2 before radiosurgery and 0.41 +/- 0.06 cm2 after radiosurgery (P < .001). Thecal sac patency improved from 55 +/- 4% to 76 +/- 3% (P < .001). Overall, neurological function improved in 81%.

Although neurosurgical decompression and radiotherapy is the standard treatment in patients with good performance, radiosurgical decompression can be a viable noninvasive treatment option for malignant epidural compression. © 2010 American Cancer Society.",Excluded
970,"Dietary carotenoids contribute to normal human skin color and UV photosensitivity The aim of the current study was to determine whether dietary carotenoids influence skin pigmentation and UV photosensitivity in a healthy unsupplemented panel (n = 22) of Caucasian (skin Type II) subjects. Skin spectrophotometric and tristimulus (L*a*b*) CR200 chromameter readings were made at various body sites to objectively measure skin carotenoid levels and skin color, respectively. The minimal erythemal dose (MED) was also measured to determine the intrinsic UV photosensitivity of the skin. We found that tristimulus b* values (but not L* and a* values) were consistently and closely correlated with skin carotenoid levels at a number of body sites including the back (r = 0.85, P < 0.00001), forehead (r = 0.85, P < 0.00001), inner forearm (r = 0.75, P < 0.0001) and palm of the hand (r = 0.78, P < 0.0001). Skin carotenoid levels and MED were also correlated in these subjects (r = 0.66, P < 0.001), as were tristimulus b* values and MED (r = 0.71, P < 0.0002). From these observations, we conclude that carotenoids from a normal, unsupplemented diet accumulate in the skin and confer a measurable photoprotective benefit (at least in lightly pigmented Caucasian skin), that is directly linked to their concentration in the tissue. Carotenoids also appear to contribute measurably and significantly to normal human skin color, in particular the appearance of yellowness"" as defined objectively by CR200 tristimulus b* values.

In the second study part, 20 patients were included who underwent abdominal CT both with the IC detector and previously at similar protocol parameters (120 kVp tube current-time product and 150 reference mAs using automated tube current modulation) with the DC detector. Images were reconstructed with filtered back projection., RESULTS: Image quality in the phantom was higher for images acquired with the IC compared with the DC detector. There was a gradually increasing noise reduction with increasing phantom sizes, with the highest (37% in the largest phantom) at 75 effective mAs (p < 0.001). In patients, noise was overall significantly (p = 0.025) reduced by 6.4% using the IC detector. Similar to the phantom, there was a gradual increase in noise reduction to 7.9% in patients with a body mass index of 25 kg/m(2) or lower (p = 0.008).

475,"Barrier requirements as the evolutionary Driver"" of epidermal pigmentation in humans"" Current explanations for the development of epidermal pigmentation during human evolution are not tenable as stand-alone hypotheses. Accordingly, we assessed instead whether xeric- and UV-B-induced stress to the epidermal permeability barrier, critical to survival in a terrestrial environment, could have driven"" the development of epidermal pigmentation. (1) Megadroughts prevailed in central Africa when hominids expanded into open savannahs [=1.5-0.8 million years ago], resulting in sustained exposure to both extreme aridity and erythemogenic UV-B, correlating with genetic evidence that pigment developed =1.2 million years ago. (2) Pigmented skin is endowed with enhanced permeability barrier function, stratum corneum integrity/cohesion, and a reduced susceptibility to infections. The enhanced function of pigmented skin can be attributed to the lower pH of the outer epidermis, likely due to the persistence of (more-acidic) melanosomes into the outer epidermis, as well as the conservation of genes associated with eumelanin synthesis and melanosome acidification (e.g., TYR, OCA2 [p protein], SLC24A5, SLC45A2, MATP) in pigmented populations. Five keratinocyte-derived signals (stem cell factor)KIT; FOXn1)FGF2; IL-1alpha , NGF, and p53) are potential candidates to have stimulated the sequential development of epidermal pigmentation in response to stress to the barrier. We summarize evidence here that epidermal interfollicular pigmentation in early hominids likely evolved in response to stress to the permeability barrier. Am. J. Hum.

The injection approach was determined by operator preference. Images were reviewed on a PACS workstation to determine the injection approach (lateral mortise versus anterior midline) and to confirm intra-articular needle placement. Fluoroscopy time (minutes), radiation dose (mGy), and DAP (muGy-m(2)) were recorded and compared using the student's t-test (fluoroscopy time) or the Wilcoxon rank sum test (radiation dose and DAP)., RESULTS: There were 246 lateral mortise injections and 252 anterior midline injections. Two lateral mortise injections were excluded from further analysis because no contrast was administered. Intra-articular location of the needle tip was documented in 242/244 lateral mortise injections and 252/252 anterior midline injections. Mean fluoroscopy time was shorter for the lateral mortise group than the anterior midline group (0.7 +/- 0.5 min versus 1.2 +/- 0.8 min, P < 0.0001).

431,"Studies on mutagen-sensitive strains of Drosophila melanogaster, VIII. Further data on differences between Canton-S and ebony strains with respect to maternal effects for the X-ray induction of autosomal translocations and ring-X chromosome losses in mature spermatozoa The influence of the maternal genotype (Canton-S, proficient in the repair of X-ray-induced chromosome breaks and ebony, less proficient in this regard) on the recovery of X-ray-induced autosomal (II-III) translocations and ring-X chromosome losses in mature spermatozoa was studied. In the first series of experiments, males carrying appropriate markers on their second and third chromosomes were irradiated and mated to Canton-S or ebony females and the frequencies of II-III translocations were determined. In the second series of experiments, males carrying ring-X chromosomes were irradiated in N2 or in O2, mated to Canton-S or ebony females and the frequencies of XO males were determined; additionally, under similar gas-treatment and radiation conditions, the pattern of egg-mortality was also assessed. The data on translocations show that the yields are higher with ebony than with Canton-S females; these and earlier results on dominant lethals and sex-linked recessive lethals support the interpretation that the maternal repair system in the ebony strain is less proficient and more error-prone than that of the Canton-S strain. Those on the losses of ring-X chromosomes demonstrate that (i) the absolute yields of XO males are lower with ebony than with Canton-S females irrespective of whether the parental males are irradiated in N2 or in O2; (ii) the exposure-frequency relationships are all linear, but the slopes are higher when the males are irradiated in O2 and are consistent with an oxygen-enhancement-ratio of about 1.5 and (iii) the relationships between the logarithm of egg-survival and XO male frequency are also linear, but the slopes for the O2 groups are lower than those for the N2 groups (slope ratios of 0.86-0.87). The finding that at given survival levels, the XO frequencies are lower in the O2 than in the N2 groups of both the Canton-S and ebony series viewed in the context of the mechanisms that have been postulated to explain the loss of ring-X chromosomes in irradiated mature spermatozoa permits the following interpretation for the observed results: (i) a higher proportion of potential XO zygotes is lost through dominant lethality in the O2 groups than in the N2 ones presumably because the chromosome breaks induced in O2 are qualitatively different in the sense that they have a higher probability to undergo reunions relative to restitution, compared with breaks induced under anoxia and (ii) this leads to lower than expected oxygen-enhancement ratios (i.e., expected on the basis of published data on sex-linked recessive lethals, another kind of genetic damage which shows a linear exposure-frequency relationship.",Excluded
221,"Performance ramifications of abnormal functional connectivity of ventral posterior lateral thalamus with cerebellum in abstinent individuals with Alcohol Use Disorder The extant literature supports the involvement of the thalamus in the cognitive and motor impairment associated with chronic alcohol consumption, but clear structure/function relationships remain elusive. Alcohol effects on specific nuclei rather than the entire thalamus may provide the basis for differential cognitive and motor decline in Alcohol Use Disorder (AUD). This functional MRI (fMRI) study was conducted in 23 abstinent individuals with AUD and 27 healthy controls to test the hypothesis that functional connectivity between anterior thalamus and hippocampus would be compromised in those with an AUD diagnosis and related to mnemonic deficits. Functional connectivity between 7 thalamic structures [5 thalamic nuclei: anterior ventral (AV), mediodorsal (MD), pulvinar (Pul), ventral lateral posterior (VLP), and ventral posterior lateral (VPL); ventral thalamus; the entire thalamus] and 14 functional regions"" was evaluated. Relative to controls, the AUD group exhibited different VPL-based functional connectivity: an anticorrelation between VPL and a bilateral middle temporal lobe region observed in controls became a positive correlation in the AUD group; an anticorrelation between the VPL and the cerebellum was stronger in the AUD than control group. AUD-associated altered connectivity between anterior thalamus and hippocampus as a substrate of memory compromise was not supported; instead, connectivity differences from controls selective to VPL and cerebellum demonstrated a relationship with impaired balance. These preliminary findings support substructure-level evaluation in future studies focused on discerning the role of the thalamus in AUD-associated cognitive and motor deficits.Copyright © 2021 Elsevier B.V.""",Excluded
746,"Biodistribution and Radiation Dosimetry of 11C-Nicotine from Whole-Body PET Imaging in Humans This study assessed the in vivo distribution of 11C-nicotine and the absorbed radiation dose from whole-body 11C-nicotine PET imaging of 11 healthy (5 male and 6 female) subjects. Methods: After an initial CT attenuation scan, 11C-nicotine was administered via intravenous injection. A dynamic PET scan was acquired for 90 s with the brain in the field of view, followed by a series of 13 whole-body PET scans acquired over a 90-min period. Regions of interest were drawn over organs visible in the reconstructed PET images. Time-activity curves were generated, and the residence times were calculated. The absorbed radiation dose for the whole body was calculated by entering the residence time in OLINDA/EXM 1.0 software to model the equivalent organ dose and the effective dose for a 70-kg man. Results: The mean residence times for 11C-nicotine in the liver, red marrow, brain, and lungs were 0.048 +/- 0.010, 0.031 +/- 0.005, 0.021 +/- 0.004, and 0.020 +/- 0.005 h, respectively. The mean effective dose for 11C-nicotine was 5.44 +/- 0.67 muSv/MBq. The organs receiving the highest absorbed dose from the 11C-nicotine injection were the urinary bladder wall (14.68 +/- 8.70 muSv/MBq), kidneys (9.56 +/- 2.46 muSv/MBq), liver (8.94 +/- 1.67 muSv/MBq), and spleen (9.49 +/- 3.89 muSv/MBq). The renal and hepatobiliary systems were the major clearance and excretion routes for radioactivity. Conclusion: The estimated radiation dose from 11C-nicotine administration is relatively modest and would allow for multiple PET examinations on the same subject.

8,"Protection from free radical formation on the scalp Hair is a protective barrier for the body against external aggressors such as solar radiation. People with bald scalps or thinning hair do not benefit from this protective barrier. It is known that solar exposure can induce oxidative stress to the skin; however not many studies have examined the potential for oxidative damage to the scalp. Free radicals produced by these stressors can lead to the generation of pro-inflammatory cytokines, MMP's and the breakdown of collagen and elastin. They can also inhibit proliferation and induce apoptosis in hair follicles. In order to determine whether scalp skin is a potential target of oxidative stress, we developed a non-invasive method to assess the generation of free radicals from measuring the chemiluminescence signal in skin. Significant free-radical production was detected from the scalp after exposure to dose of visible light (400-700nm). Traditional sunscreens block only the UV (290-400um) wavelengths of solar light, leaving the longer wavelengths to stimulate and produce free radicals in the skin. A photostable UVA/UVB sunscreen combined with a triple combination of natural antioxidants including a Parthenolide- free Feverfew Extract, a natural extract known to be a potent antioxidant, was developed to reduce the production of free radicals from the scalp. Topical application of the triple antioxidant sunscreen significantly reduced the amount of generated free radicals on the scalp. These results demonstrate that the scalps of men and women with thinning to bald scalps are a potential target of oxidative damage. Excessive damage to the hair follicle could lead to decreased proliferation and be a contributing factor to hair loss. This study suggests the need for a sunscreen with potent antioxidants to protect the scalp from the free radical induced damage from solar exposure.",Excluded
1069,"Effects of X-rays and cigarette smoking on leukocyte, lymphocyte and mitotic index values and SCE rates: the relationship between mitotic index and lymphocyte count Many previous studies revealed that smoking increases leukocyte and lymphocyte counts while exposure to X-rays decreases these counts. However the relationships between lymphocyte life span and smoking as well as X-rays were not well documented. The primary aim of this study was to determine relationships between smoking X-rays (in combination and individually) and life span of lymphocytes. Blood samples from 200 healthy individuals, half of which were X-ray exposed individuals, were collected. Half of X-ray exposed and of non-X-ray exposed individuals were smokers. There were equal numbers of male and female participants. Two lymphocyte cultures, one for the sister chromatid exchange (SCE) analysis and the other for the determination of mitotic index values were prepared using one part of the blood samples collected from the individuals. From the other part of the blood sample leukocyte and lymphocyte counts were determined with a haemogram device. Evaluation of the findings suggested that leukocyte count, lymphocyte count, mitotic index were relatively lower for the X-ray exposed individuals. In addition these values were higher for smokers than nonsmokers in general. The highest SCE rates were recorded for smoking radiology technicians. The most important finding is that lymphocyte life span is relatively low in smokers and in X-ray exposed males.",Included
792,"Radiosurgery for lung metastases secondary to renal cell carcinoma Purpose/Objective(s): Hypofractionated Stereotactic Body Radiosurgery (HFSR) is a noninvasive focused beam technique that delivers high-dose radiation. Reviewed were 77 treated kidney cancers metastases in the lungs of 44 patients in this prospective study. Materials/Methods: Seventy-seven renal cell carcinoma (RCC) lung metastases in 44 patients underwent HFSR. All the patients were evaluated prospectively before and after treatment. Age at treatment ranged from 42 to 85 years (mean 65.9) with 11 females and 33 males. Fifty-five percent of patients had prior chemotherapy, 86% had prior surgery to the primary site, and 9% had prior surgery to the lung. Tumor volumes ranged from 0.06 to 3166 cc (mean 119.5). Patients were treated with 400-900 cGy per fraction (median 800) in 3-8 fractions (median 5) for a total dose of 2000-4500 cGy (median 4000). Cancers were radiographically evaluated with contrast CT and/or MRI studies and reviewed independently by radiologists. Control of the treated cancer is defined as cessation of growth, shrinkage, or disappearance of the cancer after treatment. Result(s): Follow up ranged from 1 to 59 months (mean 12) with an overall control rate of 97%. Two of the 77 lung metastases did not respond to radiosurgery. By dose, volume, age, sex, and prior treatment, there was no statistically significant difference in outcome. Conclusion(s): Radiosurgery for metastatic RCC to the lung offers a generally well-tolerated, noninvasive treatment method with a high rate of tumor control. Patients will continue to be evaluated for longer follow-up, possible benefits of metastatic cancer treatment and survival advantage. HFSR remains an option for those whom standard approaches have not produced desired results or in patients seeking an alternative to surgical or chemotherapeutic treatment.",Excluded
1191,"Indwelling voice prosthesis insertion after total pharyngolaryngectomy with free jejunal reconstruction Objectives: Total pharyngolaryngectomy with free jejunal reconstruction is often performed in patients with hypopharyngeal carcinoma. However, postoperative speechlessness significantly decreases patient quality of life. We investigated whether Provox insertion could preserve speech after total pharyngolaryngectomy with free jejunal reconstruction. Study Design: Retrospective chart review. Method(s): A total of 130 cases of secondary Provox insertions after total pharyngolaryngectomy with free jejunal reconstruction were analyzed. Communication outcomes were compared using the Head and Neck Cancer Understandability of Speech Subscale. Outcomes and complications associated with insertion site (jejunal insertion vs. esophageal insertion) and adjuvant irradiation therapy were also evaluated. Result(s): Provox insertion had favorable communication outcomes in 102 cases (78.4%). Neither the insertion site nor irradiation affected the communication outcome. Complications were observed in 20 cases (15.4%). Local infection was the most common complication. Free jejunal insertion, in which the resection range was enlarged, had a lower complication rate than did esophageal insertion, and its complication rate was unaffected by previous irradiation. For all patients, the hospitalization duration and duration of speechlessness were 13.4 days and 14.6 months, respectively. Patients receiving jejunal insertions had a significantly shorter hospitalization duration than did those receiving esophageal insertions. Unlike Provox2, ProvoxVega significantly reduced the complication rate to zero. Conclusion(s): For jejunal inserson of a Provox prosthetic, a sufficient margin can be maintained during total pharyngolaryngectomy and irradiation can be performed, and satisfactory communication outcomes were observed. Provox insertion after total pharyngolaryngectomy with free jejunal reconstruction should be considered the standard therapy for voice restoration.

727,"Changes in posterior scleral collagen microstructure in canine eyes with an ADAMTS10 mutation PURPOSE: We aimed to characterize alterations in the posterior scleral collagen microstructure before detectable disease onset in a canine model of open-angle glaucoma caused by an ADAMTS10 mutation., METHODS: Collagen orientation, anisotropy degree (proportion of preferentially aligned collagen), and relative density were measured at 0.4 mm spatial resolution using synchrotron wide-angle X-ray scattering. For statistical evaluation of structure parameters, regional averages of the peripapillary and mid-posterior sclera were compared between ADAMTS10 mutant (affected) dogs (n = 3) and age-matched (carrier) controls (n = 3)., RESULTS: No marked differences in the general pattern of preferential collagen fibril orientation were noted between the control and affected dogs. The peripapillary sclera of all specimens featured strongly aligned circumferential collagen ringing the optic nerve head. Collagen anisotropy was significantly reduced in the mid-posterior sclera of the affected dogs (carrier: 0.27+/-0.11; affected: 0.24+/-0.10; p = 0.032) but was not statistically significantly different in the peripapillary sclera (carrier: 0.46+/-0.15; affected: 0.45+/-0.17; p = 0.68). Collagen density was statistically significantly reduced in the affected dogs for the mid-posterior sclera (carrier: 28.1+/-9.14; affected: 18.3+/-5.12; p<0.0001) and the peripapillary sclera (carrier: 34.6+/-9.34; affected: 21.1+/-6.97; p = 0.0002)., CONCLUSIONS: Significant alterations in the posterior scleral collagen microstructure are present before the onset of clinical glaucoma in ADAMTS10 mutant dogs. A reduction in fibrous collagen density is likely an important contributory factor in the previously reported mechanical weakening of the sclera in this model. Baseline scleral abnormalities have the potential to interact with intraocular pressure (IOP) elevations in determining the course of glaucoma progression in animal models of the disease, and potentially in human glaucoma.",Excluded
886,"Dependency of the interaural phase difference sensitivities of inferior collicular neurons on a preceding tone and its implications in neural population coding This study examined the sensitivities of the neuronal responses in the inferior colliculus (IC) to the interaural phase difference (IPD) of a preceding tone, and explored its implications in the neural-population representation of the IPD. Single-unit responses were recorded from the IC of anesthetized gerbils. The stimulus was a dichotic tone sequence with a common frequency (typically the unit's best frequency) and level (10-20 dB relative to the threshold), consisting of a conditioner (200 ms) followed by a probe (50 ms) with a silent gap (5-100 ms) between them. The IPDs of the 2 tones were varied independently. The presence of a conditioner generally suppressed the probe-driven responses; the effect size increased as the conditioner IPD approached the unit's most responsive IPD. The units' preferred IPDs were relatively invariant with the conditioner IPD. Two types of models were used to evaluate the effects of a conditioner on the IPD representation at the level of IC neural population. One was a version of the population-vector model. The other was the hemispheric-channel model, which assumed that the stimulus IPD is represented by the activities of 2 broadly tuned hemispheric channels. Both models predicted that, in the presence of a conditioner, the IPD representation would shift in a direction away from the conditioner IPD. This appears to emphasize the difference between the conditioner and the probe IPDs. The results indicate that in the IC, neural processes for IPD adapt to the stimulus history to enhance the representational contrast between successive sounds.",Excluded

Diagnostic rates, histologic findings, radiation doses, complication rates, and procedure duration were assessed by retrospective review of charts and images and were compared for the standard-dose and reduced-dose groups., RESULTS: Biopsy was performed using the standard-dose CT protocol (mean reference tube current-exposure time setting, 205.0 +/- 19.0 [SD] mAs) for 43 lesions, and the reduced-dose CT protocol (reference tube current-exposure time setting, 42.0 +/- 7.5 mAs) for 31 lesions. In the reduced-dose group, there were 29 lesions (94%) with diagnostic results. In the standard-dose group, biopsies of 42 lesions (98%) yielded diagnostic results. No complications that needed intervention or hospitalization occurred in either group. The dose-length product (DLP) was significantly higher in the standard-dose group than the reduced-dose group (574 +/- 232 vs 152 +/- 63 mGy x cm, respectively; p < 0.05).

872,"Biodistribution and radiation dosimetry of the serotonin 5-HT₆ ligand [¹¹C]GSK215083 determined from human whole-body PET PURPOSE: We measured the whole-body distribution of IV-injected [¹¹C]GSK215083, a new 5-HT₆ antagonist PET tracer, as a function of time in adult subjects, in order to determine the radiation exposure.
PROCEDURES: After injection with a single bolus of [¹¹C]GSK215083 (range 330-367 MBq; mean 346 MBq), PET emission data were acquired for approximately 120 min in six subjects (three males and three females). Five organs were identified as exhibiting uptake above background. For these, regions of interest were delineated on emission images, and time-activity curves (TAC) generated. Residence times were calculated as the area under the curve of the TAC, normalized to injected activities and standard values of organ volumes. Dosimetry calculations were then performed using the computer program OLINDA/EXM 1.0.
RESULTS: The mean effective dose averaged over both males and females (deviation) was estimated to be 7.7 ± 1.0 μSv/MBq (male 7.0 ± 0.4; female 8.5 ± 0.6). For the effective dose equivalent, the corresponding values are 7.8 ± 1.2 μSv/MBq (male 6.8 ± 0.5; female 8.9 ± 0.1). The organ receiving the highest dose was the lung, with an average equivalent dose of 25.6 ± 6.9 μSv/MBq (male 20.8 ± 5.6; female 30.4 ± 4.4).
CONCLUSION: The estimated radiation dose for [¹¹C]GSK215083 is consistent with those for other neuroreceptor ligands labeled with carbon-11. The somewhat higher dose estimate for females compared to males may reflect the difference in observed residence times and representative differences in the male and female phantoms used for dosimetry calculations. Based on conventionally accepted dose limits, [¹¹C]GSK215083 may be used for multiple PET scans in the same subject.",Excluded

The current standard or RT among HIV-positive cancer patients who are immuno-compromised does not differ from that of HIV-negative ones., OBJECTIVE: To determine the effects of radiation therapy on immunological and virological status among HIV-infected cancer patients., MATERIAL AND METHOD: A prospective observational study was conducted of HIV-infected cancer patients who received definitive RT in seven hospitals in Thailand. Blood samples were taken to determine immune status using CD4%, and virological status was identified using plasma HIV-RNA viral load (HIV-VL) assay: at baseline before RT at the last week of RT completion; and at the 6-month follow-up visit. Additional CD4% test was performed at the 3-month follow-up visit., RESULTS: Ninety HIV-infected cancer patients from seven hospitals in Thailand were included in the analysis. The median age was 40 years old (range 19-61). Seventy-six patients (84.4%) were female and 65 (72.2%) were cases of invasive cervical cancers. Eighty-seven percent of patients had been receiving antiretroviral treatment (ART) before RT The mean CD4% at baseline, RT completion, 3-month and 6-month follow-up visits, were 18.7%, 20.1%, 16.8% and 17.1%, respectively. The proportion of CD4% reduction in the non-ART group was higher than that of the ART group throughout the period, particularly at the 3-month follow-up visit (100% vs. 29.7%, p = 0.0004). Six cases had a HIV-VL increase of more than 10 times (1-log10) at completion of RT: 3 of these were non-ART and 3 were ART-uncontrolled viral suppression., CONCLUSION: RT had a suppressive effect on immunological status in HIV-infected cancer patients, particularly in the subacute period among those who were not on ART HIV-disease progression was observed during radiation treatment in HIV-infected cancer patients without ART and those with ART-uncontrolled viral suppression.",Excluded

Iterative reconstruction was used in all patients. For image quality assessment, CTA images were evaluated on a three-point scale and signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR) were calculated and compared. Furthermore, computed tomography (CT) dose index was recorded., RESULTS: Mean CT values and noise levels were higher in group A compared to group B (all P < .001), whereas SNR and CNR were lower than those in group B (all P < .001). Furthermore, the image quality of the aorta at the level of the diaphragm was lower in group A than that in group B (P < .05). However, image quality was graded as diagnostic in all patients, and motion artifacts of the aortic arch were significantly decreased in group A (P <.05). Interreader agreement was good or excellent for image quality assessment (k = 0.625-0.835). The 70-kVp CTA protocol, which allows dose reduction of 85%, was considered diagnostic in all instances by two readers., CONCLUSIONS: Our proposed thoracic aortic CTA protocol provides diagnostic information with substantial reduction of both radiation and contrast agent doses compared to standard-pitch CTA at 100 kVp.

CT was performed within 1 week of bronchoscopy. All patients were scanned with a standard protocol, including end-inspiratory and dynamic expiratory volumetric imaging, using an eight-detector multislice helical CT scanner. For both CT and bronchoscopy, malacia was defined as >/= 50% expiratory reduction of the airway lumen. CT and bronchoscopic findings were subsequently jointly reviewed by the radiologist and bronchoscopist for concordance., RESULTS: Twenty-nine patients (12 men and 17 women; mean age, 60 years; range, 36 to 79 years) comprised the study cohort. CT correctly diagnosed malacia in 28 of 29 patients (97%). The most common presenting symptoms were dyspnea in 20 patients (69%), severe or persistent cough in 16 patients (55%), and recurrent infection in 7 patients (24%). The estimated radiation dose (expressed as dose-length product) for the dual-phase study is 508 mGy-cm, which is comparable to a routine chest CT., CONCLUSION: Dynamic expiratory CT is a highly sensitive method for detecting airway malacia and has the potential to serve as an effective, noninvasive test for diagnosing this condition.""",Excluded
684,"Facial involvement in indian psoriatic patients and its association with disease severity and metabolic syndrome-a cross-sectional study Introduction: Face was often thought to be spared in psoriasis possibly due to the protective effect of sebum and low-dose ambient UV radiation exposure. Few have suggested that facial involvement is common and indicates disease severity. There is a paucity of data on this, particularly from India. Psoriatics have a higher prevalence of metabolic syndrome (MetS) and, patients with severe disease are at greater risk. Objective(s): We decided to study the frequency, type of facial involvement in Indian psoriatic patients and its association with disease severity and MetS. Material(s) and Method(s): 250 consecutive psoriatic patients were enrolled. Facial psoriatics were divided into peripherofacial(PF), centrofacial(CF) and mixed facial(MF) types. Disease severity was assessed using whole body, scalp, facial Psoriasis area severity index (PASI) scores and Nail area psoriasis severity index (NAPSI) scores. Patients were evaluated for the presence of MetS using NCEP-III criteria. All parameters were compared both between facial and non-facial psoriatics and, between cases with different types of face involvement. Result(s): The mean age(p-0.04) and age of onset of disease(p-0.02) was lower and median whole body PASI score higher(p<0.001) in psoriatics with facial involvement than those without. No significant association was found between facial involvement and MetS. MF was the commonest type of facial involvement and there was a significant association of mixed facial involvement with increased total body PASI and head PASI scores. (p<0.001). Conclusion(s): Facial involvement in psoriatics is associated with severe disease, but not metabolic syndrome. Mixed facial type might be considered a marker of overall psoriasis disease severity in the Indian population.",Excluded

Simultaneously, with the augmentation on each side a microimplant was placed vertically from the top of the alveolar crest penetrating the residual bone and the grafting material. Eight months after initial surgery the microimplants were retrieved with a surrounding bone core. The composition of residual graft material and surrounding bone was analysed by scanning electron microscopy and energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy., RESULTS: Residual graft material of both types was present as 10-500 mum particles in direct contact with, or completely surrounded by, newly formed bone; smaller particles were also present in non-mineralized tissue. In the case of BCP the bone-graft substitute interface showed evidence of superficial disintegration of particles into individual grains. Median Ca/P ratios (at.%), determined from >200 discreet sites within residual graft particles and adjacent bone, were: DBB: 1.61 (confidence interval [CI] 1.59-1.64); BCP: 1.5 (CI 1.45-1.52); DBB-augmented bone: 1.62 (CI 1.59-1.66); BCP-augmented bone: 1.52 (CI 1.47-1.55); P=0.028 for DBB vs. BCP and DBB- vs. BCP-augmented bone. The reduction in Ca/P ratio for BCP over the healing period is consistent with the dissolution of beta-TCP and reprecipitation on the surface of calcium-deficient hydroxyapatite., CONCLUSION: The beta-TCP component of BCP may be gradually substituted by calcium-deficient hydroxyapatite over the healing period. This process and superficial degranulation of BCP particles may influence the progress of resorption and healing.",Excluded
709,"Boron neutron capture therapy outcomes for advanced or recurrent head and neck cancer We retrospectively review outcomes of applying boron neutron capture therapy (BNCT) to unresectable advanced or recurrent head and neck cancers. Patients who were treated with BNCT for either local recurrent or newly diagnosed unresectable head or neck cancers between December 2001 and September 2007 were included. Clinicopathological characteristics and clinical outcomes were retrieved from hospital records. Either a combination of borocaptate sodium and boronophenylalanine (BPA) or BPA alone were used as boron compounds. In all the treatment cases, the dose constraint was set to deliver a dose <10-12 Gy-eq to the skin or oral mucosa. There was a patient cohort of 62, with a median follow-up of 18.7 months (range, 0.7-40.8). A total of 87 BNCT procedures were performed. The overall response rate was 58% within 6 months after BNCT. The median survival time was 10.1 months from the time of BNCT. The 1- and 2-year overall survival (OS) rates were 43.1% and 24.2%, respectively. The major acute Grade 3 or 4 toxicities were hyperamylasemia (38.6%), fatigue (6.5%), mucositis/stomatitis (9.7%) and pain (9.7%), all of which were manageable. Three patients died of treatment-related toxicity. Three patients experienced carotid artery hemorrhage, two of whom had coexistent infection of the carotid artery. This study confirmed the feasibility of our dose-estimation method and that controlled trials are warranted.",Excluded
1129,"Clinical presentation of head and neck skin malignancies among albinos and value of basic surgical intervention Background: Radiation from sunlight may play a role in the clinical presentation of head and neck skin cancers in albinos. This study assesses the clinical presentation of such cancers and outcome of basic surgical treatment without primary repair of resulting defects. Method(s): An analysis of sites from head and neck affected by cancers using traditional anatomical landmarks was carried out. The frequency of involvement of each division in malignant skin changes was also documented and compared. Result(s): The eyes were not involved with any malignancy. With the head and neck region partitioned by a transverse line using the lateral canthus of the eye as landmark, the superior portion was found to be involved in 209 lesions, all (100 %) of which were successfully treated. The inferior portion had 119 but enjoyed 92.4 % success rate. With the head and neck region partitioned in the coronal plane using the lateral canthus of the eye as landmark, the posterior portion was involved in 282 lesions, of which 273 (96.8 %) were successfully treated. The anterior portion was involved in 46 lesions, all (100 %) of which were successfully treated. Conclusion(s): Hair appears to protect the skin beneath it from actinic damage and cancers among albinos. Failed treatment was recorded only among lesions on the cheek and neck.

576,"Cervical lymph node involvement in carcinomas of the mobile tongue in Tunisia. Retrospective study of 135 cases OBJECTIVE: To report the profile of histologic cervical nodes involvement associated with mobile tongue squamous cell carcinoma. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Our retrospective study concerned patients treated from 1978 to 1998 by cervical neck dissection for mobile tongue carcinoma. RESULT(S): A population of 135 patients (90 M/45 F, sex-ratio 2) with a 53.5 mean age (19 to 75) is analyzed. Clinical palpable nodes were present in 68 cases (50%) mainly submental-submaxillar (54). Histologic examination showed a node involvement in 54 cases without (32 cases) or with capsular rupture (22 cases) mainly in the jugulo-carotidian chain (46/54). Among the 67 clinically N0 patients collected after 1990, 22 patients (33%) exhibited an histological involvement vs 32/68 (47%) for the group presenting palpable cervical nodes for the whole period. Histologic node involvement seemed to be linked to the clinical status, node size and TNM stage. CONCLUSION(S): Cervical lymph node treatment needs to be systematic in mobile tongue carcinoma. The probability of histologic involvement is linked to the loco-regional extent of disease and influences the prognosis. In N0 patients, neck dissection is required because of the frequency of histological involvement, particularly when loss to follow-up may be expected.",Excluded
1146,"Occupational Health Risks in Cardiac Catheterization Laboratory Workers BACKGROUND: Orthopedic strain and radiation exposure are recognized risk factors in personnel staff performing fluoroscopically guided cardiovascular procedures. However, the potential occupational health effects are still unclear. The purpose of this study was to examine the prevalence of health problems among personnel staff working in interventional cardiology/cardiac electrophysiology and correlate them with the length of occupational radiation exposure., METHODS AND RESULTS: We used a self-administered questionnaire to collect demographic information, work-related information, lifestyle-confounding factors, all current medications, and health status. A total number of 746 questionnaires were properly filled comprising 466 exposed staff (281 males; 44+/-9 years) and 280 unexposed subjects (179 males; 43+/-7years). Exposed personnel included 218 interventional cardiologists and electrophysiologists (168 males; 46+/-9 years); 191 nurses (76 males; 42+/-7 years), and 57 technicians (37 males; 40+/-12 years) working for a median of 10 years (quartiles: 5-24 years). Skin lesions (P=0.002), orthopedic illness (P<0.001), cataract (P=0.003), hypertension (P=0.02), and hypercholesterolemia (P<0.001) were all significantly higher in exposed versus nonexposed group, with a clear gradient unfavorable for physicians over technicians and nurses and for longer history of work (>16 years). In highly exposed physicians, adjusted odds ratio ranged from 1.7 for hypertension (95% confidence interval: 1-3; P=0.05), 2.9 for hypercholesterolemia (95% confidence interval: 1-5; P=0.004), 4.5 for cancer (95% confidence interval: 0.9-25; P=0.06), to 9 for cataract (95% confidence interval: 2-41; P=0.004)., CONCLUSIONS: Health problems are more frequently observed in workers performing fluoroscopically guided cardiovascular procedures than in unexposed controls, raising the need to spread the culture of safety in the cath laboratory.

900,"Seesaw-Like Cervical Ossification of Posterior Longitudinal Ligament Ossification of posterior longitudinal ligament (OPLL) is a pathological process in which lamellar bone is deposited at the posterior longitudinal ligament and can lead to a limited range of cervical motion and spinal cord compression. A 64-year-old man presented with a 10-month history of worsening clumsiness in the hands and impaired gait, and he occasionally had a feeling of an electric shock in the limbs when the neck was flexed. Physical examination revealed atrophy of the intrinsic hand muscles, rapid reflexes in the lower extremities, and positive Hoffman sign and Babinski sign results. Seesaw-like OPLL was observed on hyperextension and hyperflexion x-rays, which also showed that the OPLL involved the spinal canal; laminoplasty and laminectomy were not recommended for this specific type of OPLL, even though the K-line was positive on both x-rays.Copyright © 2021 Elsevier Inc.",Excluded
1063,"Complications after stereotactic radiosurgery for brain metastases: Incidences, correlating factors, treatments and outcomes BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Complications after stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) for brain metastases (BMs) were analyzed in detail using our database including nearly 3000 BM patients., MATERIALS AND METHODS: This was an institutional review board-approved, retrospective cohort study using our prospectively accumulated database including 3271 consecutive patients who underwent gamma knife SRS for BMs during the 1998-2016 period. Excluding four patients lost to follow-up, 112 with three-staged treatment and 189 with post-operative irradiation, 2966 who underwent a single-session of SRS only as radical irradiation were studied., RESULTS: The overall median survival time after SRS was 7.8 (95% CI; 7.4-8.1) months. Post-SRS complications occurred in 86 patients (2.9%) 1.9-211.4 (median; 24.0, IQR; 12.0-64.6) months after treatment. RTOG neurotoxicity grades were 2, 3 and 4 in 58, 25 and 3 patients, respectively. Cumulative incidences determined with a competing risk analysis were 1.4%, 2.2%, 2.4%, 2.6% and 2.9% at the 12th, 24th, 36th, 48th and 60th post-SRS month, respectively. Among various pre-SRS clinical factors and radiosurgical parameters, multivariable analyses demonstrated solitary tumor (Adjusted HR; 0.584, 95% CI; 0.381-0.894, p=0.0133), controlled primary cancer (Adjusted HR; 2.595, 95% CI; 1.646-4.091, p<0.0001), no extra-cerebral metastases (Adjusted HR; 1.608, 95% CI; 1.028-2.514, p=0.0374), KPS >=80% (Adjusted HR; 2.715, 95% CI; 1.245-5.924, p=0.0121) and largest tumor volume >=3.3cc (Adjusted HR; 0.516, 95% CI; 0.318-0.836, p=0.0072) to be independently significant predictors of a higher incidence of complications., CONCLUSION: The post-SRS complication incidence is acceptably low (2.9%).

484,"Radial versus femoral access for coronary angiography and intervention is associated with lower patient radiation exposure in high-radial-volume centres: Insights from the RAY'ACT-1 study BACKGROUND: Literature suggests that radial access is associated with higher radiation doses than femoral access., AIMS: To compare patient radiation exposure during coronary angiography (CA) and percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) with radial versus femoral access., METHODS: RAY'ACT is a nationwide, multicentre, French survey evaluating patient radiation in interventional cardiology. Variables of patient exposure from 21,675 CAs and 17,109 PCIs performed at 44 centres during 2010 were analysed retrospectively., RESULTS: Radial access was used in 71% of CAs and 69% of PCIs. Although median fluoroscopy times were longer for radial versus femoral access (CA, 3.8 vs 3.5minutes [P<0.001]; PCI, 10.4 vs 10.1minutes [P=0.001]), the Kerma-area product (KAP) was lower with radial access (CA, 26.8 vs 28.1Gy.cm2; PCI, 55.6 vs 59.4Gy.cm2; both P=0.001). Differences in KAP remained significant in the multivariable analysis (P<0.01), and in a propensity score-matched analysis (P=0.01). A significant interaction was found between KAP and the percentage of procedures with radial access by centre (P<0.001). KAP was higher by radial versus femoral access in low-radial-volume centres, and lower in high-radial-volume centres. Radiation protection techniques, such as the use of low frame rates (7.5 frame/s), were used more frequently in high-radial-volume radial centres., CONCLUSIONS: In this multicentre study, radial access was associated with lower radiation doses to patient than femoral access in high-radial-volume centres. Provided that radioprotection methods are implemented, radial access could be associated with lower patient radiation exposure. Copyright © 2016 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.",Excluded
1221,"Assessment of primary and secondary implant stability by resonance frequency analysis in anterior and posterior segments of maxillary edentulous ridges Purpose: The aim of this study was to analyze the implant stability quotient (ISQ) results of the resonance frequency (RF) during the first day of surgery and 3 months after dental implant placement in the maxilla. Material(s) and Method(s): This study was approved by 40 patients with total or partial edentulous maxillary jaws underwent with 85 dental implants. The ISQ values were measured from these 85 implants at baseline and 3 months after placement. Osttell Mentor device was invented to measure the RF value of the implant fixture through the transducer or pin. Measurements were taken 4 times in each direction of the inserted oral dental implant. OPG X-ray images were also obtained to evaluate the bone and neighbouring anatomical structures. Result(s): The ISQ at baseline had a mean value of 58 (SD 5.91) for all implants placed in anterior and posterior sectors of maxillary ridges. The mean ISQ value on the 3rd month (secondary stability) after placement for all implants was 65 (SD 5.55). An ISQ value >=65 was observed in 65 implants (78.82%) after 3 months of placement. Differences between primary and secondary mean ISQ values were statistically significant (p < 0.001). The one year cumulative success rate was 98.3% for tested and inserted oral implants. Conclusion(s): The results of presented study demonstrates and suggests that the influence and reliability of Osstell ISQ values, measured immediately and 3 months after placement it's predictable for the oral implant outcomes, especially analyzing the sensibility of secondary RFA values.Copyright © 2018, Peytchinski, Gospodin Iliev ET.

337,"Time-related changes in computed tomographic appearance and pathologic findings after radiofrequency ablation of the rabbit lung: Preliminary experimental study PURPOSE: To evaluate correlations between computed tomographic (CT) appearance and pathologic findings after radiofrequency (RF) ablation of lungs and to determine whether CT appearance could predict the extent of the effective therapeutic area. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The lungs of 14 rabbits were subjected to RF ablation and CT scans were obtained immediately and at various intervals thereafter. Four rabbits were killed immediately after the initial CT imaging (n = 4). The remaining 10 rabbits were killed after additional CT scans at intervals of 3 days (n = 2), 1 week (n = 4), 2 weeks (n = 2), and 3 weeks (n = 2) after RF ablation. Pathologic findings were correlated with CT appearance. RESULT(S): Immediately after RF ablation, a restricted area of central dense opacity enclosed by an extensive area of ground-glass opacity was noted in the ablated region on CT images. Pathologically, the former corresponded to destructive tissue and the latter corresponded to tissue with some degree of injury. After 1 week, the entire ablated region appeared as a well-demarcated homogeneous dense opacity on CT that corresponded to necrotic tissue and its surrounding rim of granulation tissue on histopathologic examination, indicating that the enclosing extensive area of ground-glass opacity on the initial CT scan represented an ongoing necrosis. Within 2-3 weeks, the ablated region gradually contracted on the CT images, representing a tissue repairing process in which the granulation tissue was encroaching on the inner necrotic tissue. CONCLUSION(S): Ground-glass opacity of the ablated region on CT immediately after RF ablation represents an ongoing necrosis. © SIR, 2005.",Excluded

234,"Comparison of 51chromium-labeled ethylenediamine tetra-acetic acid and iohexol as blood markers for intestinal permeability testing in Beagle dogs (51)Chromium-labeled ethylenediamine tetra-acetic acid ((51)Cr-EDTA) is the gold standard probe for assessing intestinal permeability (IP) in dogs, but exposure to radioactivity is a disadvantage. Iohexol is a safe contrast medium commonly used for medical imaging purposes and has been successfully applied more recently for the assessment of IP in animal models and humans. This study aimed at comparing (51)Cr-EDTA and iohexol as IP blood markers in dogs. A test solution containing (51)Cr-EDTA and iohexol was administered intragastrically to seven healthy laboratory Beagle dogs, and percentage recoveries in serum were calculated. The strong linear association (correlation, r=0.76 and linear regression, y=0.03+5.04x) between (51)Cr-EDTA and iohexol supports the potential usefulness of iohexol as an IP blood marker in dogs.

The results were compared with the ultrasound results of a control group of 142 patients presenting with symptoms of cerebrovascular disease or carotid bruit., RESULTS: NPC patients had a higher incidence of carotid stenosis (77 vs. 50.7%). The common carotid arteries were most commonly affected by radiation-induced stenosis (93/142 vs. 37/284 in the control group), whereas the carotid bulb was the most commonly affected (56/284) site in the control group. Significantly more NPC patients had moderate-to-severe stenosis (21/71 vs. 27/142). Analysis of the sonographic appearance of radiation-induced and atherosclerotic plaques showed more diffuse involvement in the post-radiation group. Non-calcified plaques and intraplaque hypoechoic foci were also more frequent in the post-radiation group., CONCLUSIONS: Radiation-induced carotid stenosis is more diffuse in distribution, is associated with more severe luminal stenosis and has different sonographic plaque characterisation compared with carotid stenosis without radiation exposure.

535,"The value of clinical prognostic factors for survival in patients with invasive urinary bladder cancer The aim of the study was to evaluate the value of clinical prognostic factors for survival of patients with invasive urinary bladder cancer treated with radical cystectomy, chemotherapy, and radiotherapy. Material and methods. A total of 115 patients with invasive urinary bladder cancer were analyzed. Twenty-three patients with invasive urinary bladder cancer (pT2-T4) were treated according to the protocol of a prospective clinical study. In all the cases, transurethral resection was followed by radiation and chemotherapy. A total dose of 54-60 Gy of radiotherapy was delivered by daily fractions of 1.8-2.0 Gy each. Simultaneous chemotherapy was started on the same day as radiotherapy; gemcitabine at a dose of 175-300 mg/m2 was delivered once a week intravenously for 6 weeks. Individual patient data was analyzed in a retrospective part of the study. Radical cystectomy was performed to 46 patients with invasive urinary bladder cancer, and radiotherapy was delivered to 46 patients. Inclusion criteria for patients into a prospective or retrospective trial were equal. We evaluated a prognostic value of various clinical factors for patients treated with radical cystectomy, chemoradiation with gemcitabine, and radiation alone. Results. The 3-year overall survival in the cystectomy group was 51.1%, in the chemoradiation group 38.0%, and in the radiotherapy group 26.9% (P=0.001). In univariate analysis in the chemoradiation group, completion of treatment according to the protocol showed a significant influence on overall survival (P=0.03). In the radiation group, completion of treatment according to the protocol showed a significant influence on overall survival too (P=0.01). In the radical cystectomy group, an important factor was a complete or incomplete TUR (P=0.02). Multivariate analysis showed a significance of hydronephrosis (P=0.03) and T stage (P=0.04) in the radiation therapy group. Comorbidity was found to be an independent prognostic factors in the chemoradiation group (P=0.02). Conclusions. The best 3-year overall survival was in the radical cystectomy group. Chemoradiation with gemcitabine could be offered as an alternative to patients refusing cystectomy. Better overall survival in the chemoradiation group was for patients without comorbidities and when treatment protocol was completed.",Excluded
1098,"Patient radiation exposure during diagnostic and therapeutic interventional neuroradiology procedures PURPOSE: Increasing in number and complexity, interventional neuroradiology (INR) procedures are becoming an important source of radiation exposure for patients. In accordance with the ALARA principle, radiation exposure during INR procedures should be curtailed as much as possible while reaching successful treatment outcomes. Moreover, the extent of radiation exposure should be one outcome measure used to assess new technologies and procedural efficacy, and training programs should include techniques for exposure limitation. This study provides a methodology and preliminary data to assess radiation exposure during different INR procedure types., MATERIALS AND METHODS: All patients undergoing endovascular procedures in two biplanar dedicated neuroangiography suites at a major academic medical center were monitored according to procedure type, pathological indication, fluoroscopy time and machine-generated patient dose estimates between April 2006 and July 2008., RESULTS: 1678 patients underwent cerebral arteriography during the study period. Women (62.1%) accounted for the majority of patients, but men (38.9%) were more likely to undergo an interventional procedure than women (32.8%). Diagnostic studies accounted for 64.9% of procedures. Variable exposures were found between diagnostic and interventional procedures. Exposure differed depending on indications for the procedure and procedure type., CONCLUSION: Radiation exposure is an increasingly important consideration in the development of minimally invasive neurological procedures including cerebral angiography and INR. The type of procedure and lesion type allow the practitioner to estimate radiation exposure. Such information informs the clinical decision making process. Normative data should be collected and used for comparison purposes as one measure of technical and procedural success.",Excluded

273,"Factors influencing aversion to specific electrodiagnostic studies Objective: To compare the degree of discomfort caused by nerve conduction studies (NCS) versus needle electromyography (EMG), and to determine what factors predict aversion to one test or the other. Method(s): Two hundred patients underwent both EMG and NCS, and were asked to indicate which test was more uncomfortable. Responses were then correlated with demographic information, testing characteristics, and medical histories to identify any notable associations. Result(s): Of the 200 patients, 58.5% (117) of the patients found the NCS more uncomfortable than EMG. Sixty-one percent (11/18) of the younger patients (18-29 years old) found EMG more uncomfortable (P = 0.08), whereas 68% (40/59) of the older patients (age greater than 60 years old) found NCS more uncomfortable (P = 0.05). Sixty-seven percent (14/21) of the patients whose BMI was less than 22 kg/m2 rated EMG as more uncomfortable (P = 0.01). Sixty-nine percent (27/39) of the patients whose BMI was greater than or equal to 38 found the NCS more uncomfortable (P = 0.02). A positive correlation existed between NCS discomfort and number of nerves tested. 67% (35/52) of the patients with polyneuropathy found NCS more uncomfortable. Conclusion(s): Nerve conduction studies are more uncomfortable than needle EMG in the majority of patients, and predictions regarding which test will be more uncomfortable for a given patient are possible. Nerve conduction studies are more uncomfortable than needle EMG for most patients, and predictions regarding which test will be more uncomfortable for a given patient are possible.Copyright © 2014 The Authors.

Unlike schistosome vaccine development strategies that relied on direct selection of antigens from crude responses leading to selection of mildly protective antigens, the present study tested the utility of selection of potentially protective antigens encompassed rounds of immunoregulation via idiotypic network. Anti-idiotypic antibodies (Ab2) were purified from sera of New Zealand white rabbits multiply immunized with gamma-irradiated cercariae of S. haematobium, using adult worm specific idiotypes (Ab1) purified from sera of subjects resistant to reinfection. Ab2 was used for immunization of C57BL/6 mice and consequences of immunization were monitored before and after challenge infection with S. haematobium. Results showed an increase of splenic T cell expression of intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) and very late antigen-4 (VLA-4) upon immunization (average % stimulated cells 54.9 vs. 20.4, P < 0.05 for ICAM-1 and 31.1 vs. 6.6, P < 0.01 for VLA-4) and challenge, especially at day 6 (83.5 vs. 45.6, P < 0.01) for ICAM-1 and day 10 (50.4 vs. 20.8, P < 0.05) for VLA-4. Thereafter, both adhesion molecules declined at day 28 through 90. Similarly, lymphoproliferation was manifested upon immunization (OD570-630 0.27 vs. 0.09, P < 0.01) and challenge at day 6 (0.5 vs. 0.17, P < 0.01) through day 10 (0.49 vs.0.18, P < 0.05), then declined at day 28 through 90. Moreover, sera of Ab2-immunized mice exhibited an anti-anti-ids (Ab3) reactivity against antigens of approximate molecular weight 40, 80 and 160 kDa of adult worms, which were also recognized by Ab1. However, in contrast to Ab1, Ab3 showed no surface binding to 3 hr schistosomula. Strikingly, mice immunized with Ab2 showed strong resistance to challenge infection (approximately 82% reduction in worm burden, P < 0.001). Taking all, this alternative vaccine development strategy appears to filter out non-protective antigens. Indeed Ab3 recognizes much fewer numbers of antigens, which passed through two rounds of immune regulation. These antigens appear to represent a significant proportion of the protective response in the gamma-irradiated cercariae vaccine and human resistance model as well, providing the basis for an alternative vaccine for schistosomiasis.",Excluded

Furthermore we studied the calcification of the rotator cuff before therapy and 6 weeks after therapy. Pain significantly improved over all patients (p < 0.0001) as well as the functional capability. X-rays 6 weeks after treatment showed a partial disintegration of calcification in about 80 % of patients. Because of the low number of patients with epicondylitis humeri we found no significant improvement of pain in these patients.

1090,"Non-medical patient-related factor influence in proximal humeral fracture outcomes: a multicentric study Purpose: Age, sex, and type of fracture have traditionally been described as prognostic factors for proximal humeral fractures (PHFs). Some non-medical patient-related factors may play a role in the outcome. This paper evaluates the association of comorbidities and socioeconomic factors with clinical outcomes for PHF. Method(s): A total of 217 patients with PHF were evaluated according to Neer's classification with X-ray. Comorbidities were assessed through the Charlson comorbidity index and, non-medical patient-related factors were determined with a 52-item questionnaire concerning personal behaviors such as social activities, family support, economic solvency, and leisure-time activities. The clinical outcome was assessed with the Constant-Murley Score (CMS), with a minimum 1-year follow-up. The minimal clinically relevant difference for the CMS was set at 10 points. A multivariable analysis was performed to adjust for comorbidities and non-medical patient-related factors, such as age, sex, fracture classification, and treatment. Result(s): One hundred and eighty-three patients completed the initial research protocol, while 126 of them completed the 1-year follow-up. The mean age was 71.6 years (SD +/- 13.3), and 79.3% of the patients were women. In the bivariable analysis, age and comorbidities were correlated with the CMS (correlation coefficient: - 0.34 [- 0.49, 0.17] and 0.35 [0.18, 0.50], respectively), as well as non-medical patient-related factors and the fracture pattern (p value ANOVA < 0.001). In the multivariable regression model, the effects of considering oneself socially active, without economic problems, and self-sufficient were associated with a higher CMS than the effect of the fracture pattern (beta coefficient: 11.69 [6.09-17.30], 15.54 [8.32-22.75], and 10.61 [3.34-17.88], respectively). Conclusion(s): Socioeconomic status had a higher impact on functional outcomes than fracture pattern in patients with PHF.Copyright © 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.",Excluded
1166,"Radiation-induced rib fracture after stereotactic body radiotherapy with a total dose of 54-56Gy given in 9-7 fractions for patients with peripheral lung tumor: Impact of maximum dose and fraction size Background: Radiation-induced rib fracture after stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) for lung cancer has been recently reported. However, incidence of radiation-induced rib fracture after SBRT using moderate fraction sizes with a long-term follow-up time are not clarified. We examined incidence and risk factors of radiation-induced rib fracture after SBRT using moderate fraction sizes for the patients with peripherally located lung tumor. Method(s): During 2003-2008, 41 patients with 42 lung tumors were treated with SBRT to 54-56Gy in 9-7 fractions. The endpoint in the study was radiation-induced rib fracture detected by CT scan after the treatment. All ribs where the irradiated doses were more than 80% of prescribed dose were selected and contoured to build the dose-volume histograms (DVHs). Comparisons of the several factors obtained from the DVHs and the probabilities of rib fracture calculated by Kaplan-Meier method were performed in the study. Result(s): Median follow-up time was 68months. Among 75 contoured ribs, 23 rib fractures were observed in 34% of the patients during 16-48 months after SBRT, however, no patients complained of chest wall pain. The 4-year probabilities of rib fracture for maximum dose of ribs (Dmax) more than and less than 54Gy were 47.7% and 12.9% (p = 0.0184), and for fraction size of 6, 7 and 8Gy were 19.5%, 31.2% and 55.7% (p = 0.0458), respectively. Other factors, such as D2cc, mean dose of ribs, V10-55, age, sex, and planning target volume were not significantly different. Conclusion(s): The doses and fractionations used in this study resulted in no clinically significant rib fractures for this population, but that higher Dmax and dose per fraction treatments resulted in an increase in asymptomatic grade 1 rib fractures.Copyright © 2015 Aoki et al.; licensee BioMed Central.",Excluded
83,"The study of eucalyptus extract effect on acne patients Phytomedicine is used now in a wide range because the natural origin which is preferred by all population and is used as a treatment or supplements more safely than chemical drugs. In this study the aqueous extract of Eucalyptus which was extracted by soaking method was used to treat Acne, the study included 60 patients (22 male and 38 female) with Acne in a mean age of (18.5) which were diagnosed in two private dermatologic clinics. The extract was prepared by soaking in distilled water for 72 hours and then concentrated by rotary evaporator. The medium of the extract was pH=6 which is accepted for skin. The aqueous crude extract then mixed with aqua rose cream (weight to volume 1:1) as a base to obtain consistent texture and the final mixture was poured in clean dry polyethylene containers and stored in 7-8 c until use. The extract was applied directly on the affected skin. The study showed that the extract has a significant effect against Acne especially in face. The improvement began after three days of usage in most cases and the improvement persists to reach 40% in the first week of use, 70% in the second week and up to 90% in the third week of use (once daily in duration of six hours). No any side effects were observed during the use of extract. The results of Eucalyptus analysis by X-ray spectrophotometer apparatus showed the presence of many essential elements in addition to the presence of volatile oils and polyphenolic compounds which are identified qualitatively.Copyright © 2021 EManuscript Technologies.

238,"Outcomes of rectal cancer with liver oligometastases Purpose: In patients with oligometastatic colorectal cancer to the liver, long term survival is possible and a multi-modality treatment approach may be considered. This is a report of a single institution experience of oligometastatic rectal cancer patients after treatment of the primary tumor and pelvic lymph nodes with extended course chemoradiation therapy. Method(s): Between 2004 and 2013, 26 oligometastatic rectal cancer patients with liver metastases were treated with extended course chemoradiation at our institution followed by total mesorectal excision (TME). Amongst these there were 17 men and 9 women. The mean age at the time of diagnosis was 59.8 years, with a range from 36 to 87 years of age. Eleven patients had metastases in other sites in addition to liver, and one patient in our cohort had lung metastasis with no liver metastasis. Kaplan-Meier method was used to generate overall survival (OS), progression free survival (PFS), distant metastases (DM) and local control (LC). Result(s): OS rates were 95%, and 70% at 12 and 24 months respectively, with a mean survival time of 40.5 months. PFS rates were 91% and 36% at 12 and 24 months respectively, with a mean PFS time of 23.1 months. LC rates were 91% and 66% at 12 and 24 months respectively. DM rates were 0% and 61% at 12 and 24 months respectively. Finally, when censoring deaths, progression of liver metastases and distant progression, Kaplan-Meier analysis demonstrated five events of local failure. Conclusion(s): This series demonstrated an OS of 70% at 24 months, with a mean survival of 40.5 months. Significantly, LC was only 66% despite the use of extended course chemoradiation and TME. This data suggests that many patients with oligometastatic rectal cancer will survive past 2 years, and that a substantial number will fail locally as well as distantly. Therefore, a multimodality approach is reasonable. Recent data suggests that a hypofractionated radiation regiment of 25 Gy in 5 Gy fractions allows an equivalent LC compared to extended course chemoradiation with 50.4 Gy in 1.8 Gy fractions. A short course of radiation may be more consistent with the goals of care of the oligometastatic rectal cancer patient who is at high risk of recurrence.Copyright © Pioneer Bioscience Publishing Company.",Excluded
527,"Radiation dose savings for adult pulmonary embolus 64-MDCT using bismuth breast shields, lower peak kilovoltage, and automatic tube current modulation OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to assess whether radiation dose savings using a lower peak kilovoltage (kVp) setting, bismuth breast shields, and automatic tube current modulation could be achieved while preserving the image quality of MDCT scans obtained to assess for pulmonary embolus (PE)., MATERIALS AND METHODS: CT angiography (CTA) examinations were performed to assess for the presence or absence of pulmonary artery emboli using a 64-MDCT scanner with automatic tube current modulation (noise level=10 HU), two kVp settings (120 and 140 kVp), and bismuth breast shields. Absorbed organ doses were measured using anthropomorphic phantoms and metal oxide semiconductor field effect transistor (MOSFET) detectors. Image quality was assessed quantitatively as well as qualitatively in various anatomic sites of the thorax., RESULTS: Using a lower kVp (120 vs 140 kVp) and automatic tube current modulation resulted in a dose savings of 27% to the breast and 47% to the lungs. The use of a lower kVp (120 kVp), automatic tube current modulation, and bismuth shields placed directly on the anterior chest wall reduced absorbed breast and lung doses by 55% and 45%, respectively. Qualitative assessment of the images showed no change in image quality of the lungs and mediastinum when using a lower kVp, bismuth shields, or both., CONCLUSION: The use of bismuth breast shields together with a lower kVp and automatic tube current modulation will reduce the absorbed radiation dose to the breast and lungs without degradation of image quality to the organs of the thorax for CTA detection of PE.",Excluded
960,"RadRAT: a radiation risk assessment tool for lifetime cancer risk projection Risk projection methods allow for timely assessment of the potential magnitude of radiation-related cancer risks following low-dose radiation exposures. The estimation of such risks directly through observational studies would generally require infeasibly large studies and long-term follow-up to achieve reasonable statistical power. We developed an online radiation risk assessment tool (RadRAT) which can be used to estimate the lifetime risk of radiation-related cancer with uncertainty intervals following a user-specified exposure history (https://irep.nci.nih.gov/radrat). The uncertainty intervals constitute a key component of the program because of the various assumptions that are involved in such calculations. The risk models used in RadRAT are broadly based on those developed by the BEIR VII committee for estimating lifetime risk following low-dose radiation exposure of the US population for eleven site-specific cancers. We developed new risk models for seven additional cancer sites, oral, oesophagus, gallbladder, pancreas, rectum, kidney and brain/central nervous system (CNS) cancers, using data from Japanese atomic bomb survivors. The lifetime risk estimates are slightly higher for RadRAT than for BEIR VII across all exposure ages mostly because the weighting of the excess relative risk and excess absolute risk models was conducted on an arithmetic rather than a logarithmic scale. The calculator can be used to estimate lifetime cancer risk from both uniform and non-uniform doses that are acute or chronic. It is most appropriate for low-LET radiation doses < 1 Gy, and for individuals with life-expectancy and cancer rates similar to the general population in the US.",Excluded
863,"Skin cancer in heart transplant recipients: frequency and risk factor analysis BACKGROUND: The frequency of skin cancer is increased among organ transplant recipients, but the predisposing risk factors are controversial. It is also unclear whether heart transplant patients face an increased risk compared to recipients of other organs, e.g. kidney transplants., METHODS: We performed univariate and multivariate analysis of risk factors for skin cancer in 252 heart transplants and in a control series of 228 kidney transplants followed up at a single center. An extensive dermatologic examination was carried out; baseline features, type of immunosuppression, number of 3A rejection episodes, extent of sunlight exposure and skin type were recorded. Multivariate analysis (Cox regression) included: age at transplantation, sex, skin type (Fitzpatrick's criteria), presence of solar keratosis, presence of warts, type of organ, sunlight exposure., RESULTS: During follow up skin cancer was more common among heart transplants (40, 16 %) than in kidney transplants (16, 7%, p = 0.004). The cumulative incidence of skin cancer by life table analysis increased from 16% after 5 years to 33% after 10 years in heart transplant patients and from 6% to 17% in kidney transplants (p 10000 hours (relative risk = 2.8), but not organ type were significant risk factors., CONCLUSION: Age at transplant, skin type and sunlight exposure, but not type of organ and type of immunosuppressive regimen, are associated with increased risk of skin cancer in heart transplantation.",Excluded
812,"Doctors' knowledge of radiation -- a two-centre study and historical comparison AIM: To investigate knowledge of the use of ionizing radiation in 2010 and whether there has been any change in this knowledge since the study was first undertaken over 7 years ago. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In both studies a single chest x-ray was classed as one unit of radiation. Doctors from all grades were asked to evaluate the average radiation dose incurred with 13 commonly undertaken radiological procedures, including magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), computed tomography (CT), etc. Answers within 20% of the actual dose were marked as correct. RESULTS: Two hundred and forty-two questionnaires were completed (130 in 2003; 112 in 2010). Equal numbers of juniors, middle grades, and consultants were questioned, and scores were comparable (23.3% in 2003; 29.4% in 2010). The majority of doctors (92% in 2003; 86% in 2010) correctly noted that ultrasound and MRI involve no radiation. Doctors underestimated the radiation doses of all investigations by a smaller margin in 2010 compared to 2003 (i.e., more accurately), with only one exception: CT of the abdomen. CONCLUSION: Despite evidence of some improvement, doctors of all grades still have a very poor knowledge of radiation exposure even with the most common investigations. The worsening appreciation of the radiation involved in CT scanning is especially worrying considering its increasing use in practice today.",Excluded
1187,"Chronic Actinic Dermatitis: a Review Purpose of Review: To update readers on the current understandings of chronic actinic dermatitis (CAD) in regard to epidemiology, clinical findings, pathophysiology, treatment, and prognosis. Recent Findings: CAD is classically thought to be primarily a disease of elderly Caucasian males, though recent evidence suggests that in skin of color, the disease manifests more often in younger females. Recent studies suggest the pathogenesis of CAD involves a type-IV hypersensitivity reaction, similar to allergic contact dermatitis. There is also evidence of resistance to UV-induced immunosuppression in these patients, similar to polymorphous light eruption (PMLE). Furthermore, a lower CD4/CD8 ratio on flow cytometry in CAD patients has been correlated with increased tissue burden of disease. Photoprotection remains a mainstay of treatment, though recent evidence suggests potential efficacy of tofacitinib or short courses of narrowband UVB phototherapy as treatment options. Summary: CAD is an immunologically mediated photodermatosis characterized by pruritic eczematous lesions of sun-exposed areas, most commonly seen in older Caucasian males. While the pathogenesis of the condition is not fully understood, a type-IV hypersensitivity reaction to UV-induced neoantigens is thought to play a role. Photoprotection remains the mainstay of treatment, though adjunctive treatments are rapidly emerging. Though considered a chronic condition, CAD tends to improve over time.Copyright © 2019, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.",Excluded
814,"Clinical implications of the tumor volume reduction rate in head-and-neck cancer during definitive intensity-modulated radiotherapy for organ preservation Purpose: To investigate the prognostic value of the volume reduction rate (VRR) in patients with head-and-neck cancer treated with intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT). Methods and Materials: Seventy-six patients with oropharyngeal cancer (OPC) and another 76 with hypopharyngeal cancer (HPC) were enrolled in volumetric analysis. All patients received allocated radiotherapy courses. Adaptive computed tomography was done 4 to 5 weeks after the start of IMRT. Primary tumor volume measurement was derived using separate images for the pretreatment gross tumor volume (pGTV) and the interval gross tumor volume. Result(s): In the OPC group, the pGTV ranged from 6.6 to 242.6 mL (mean, 49.9 mL), whereas the value of the VRR ranged from 0.014 to 0.74 (mean, 0.43). In HPC patients, the pGTV ranged from 4.1 to 152.4 mL (mean, 35.6 mL), whereas the VRR ranged from -1.15 to 0.79 (mean, 0.33). Multivariate analysis of the primary tumor relapse-free survival for OPC revealed three prognostic factors: T4 tumor (p = 0.0001, hazard ratio 7.38), pGTV >=20 mL (p = 0.01, hazard ratio 10.61), and VRR <0.5 (p = 0.001, hazard ratio 6.49). Multivariate analysis of the primary tumor relapse-free survival for HPC showed two prognostic factors: pGTV >=30 mL (p = 0.001, hazard ratio 2.87) and VRR <0.5 (p = 0.03, hazard ratio 2.25). Conclusion(s): The VRR is an outcome predictor for local control in OPC and HPC patients treated with IMRT. Those with large tumor volumes or a VRR <0.5 should be considered for a salvage operation or a dose-escalation scheme. Copyright © 2011 Elsevier Inc.",Excluded
621,"Effects of exposure to a mobile phone on sexual behavior in adult male rabbit: an observational study The accumulating effects of exposure to electromagnetic radiation emitted by a conventional mobile phone (MP) on male sexual behaviour have not yet been analyzed. Therefore, we studied these effects in 18 male rabbits that were randomly divided into phone and control groups. Six female teasers were taken successively to the male's cage and the copulatory behavior was recorded. Serum total testosterone, dopamine and cortisol were evaluated. The animals of the phone group were exposed to MPs (800 MHz) in a standby position for 8 h daily for 12 weeks. At the end of the study, the copulatory behavior and hormonal assays were re-evaluated. Mounts without ejaculation were the main mounts in the phone group and its duration and frequency increased significantly compared with the controls, whereas the reverse was observed in its mounts with ejaculation. Ejaculation frequency dropped significantly, biting/grasping against teasers increased notably and mounting latency in accumulated means from the first to the fourth teasers were noted in the phone group. The hormonal assays did not show any significant differences between the study groups. Therefore, the pulsed radiofrequency emitted by a conventional MP, which was kept on a standby position, could affect the sexual behavior in the rabbit.",Excluded
910,"Evaluating the radioprotective effect of Cimetidine, IMOD, and hybrid radioprotectors agents: An in-vitro study INTRODUCTION: There are various radioprotective agents with different mechanisms that help to decrease ionizing radiation side effects. The radioprotective effect of Cimetidine and IMOD was assessed individually and compared with the hybrid radioprotectors agents (HRPAs-IMOD and Cimetidine) on human lymphocyte cells., METHODS: Twenty healthy volunteers (ten men and ten women) participated in the present study. About 75 mL peripheral blood lymphocytes from each individual were collected, and they were divided into 36 groups. Briefly, the blood samples were treated with different concentrations of Cimetidine (12.6 and 25.2 mug/mL) and IMOD (0.04, 0.08, and 0.12 mg/mL), and also a combination of these agents, namely hybrid radioprotectors agents (HRPAs). Besides, the irradiated groups were exposed to 2 and 4 Gy of Co-60 gamma irradiation. The amount of cellular damage was assessed using the micronucleus assay. The repeated measurements and paired T-test statistical analysis were used to compare the micronucleus frequencies in different groups., RESULTS: The micronucleus frequencies were significantly reduced (p < 0.05) in irradiated groups when the non-toxic concentrations of Cimetidine, IMOD, and HRPAs have been used. The reduction in micronucleus frequency was obtained 5-29% for Cimetidine and 40-51% for IMOD in peripheral blood lymphocytes irradiated with 2 Gy. This reduction in 4 Gy irradiation was 8-17% for Cimetidine and 27-37% for IMOD. The HRPAs resulted in a higher radioprotective effect, in a way that they cause up to 58% and 43% micronucleus frequency reduction in 2 and 4 Gy, respectively., CONCLUSION: In conclusion, the HRPAs showed the highest level of radioprotective. In addition, IMOD was remarkably higher radioprotective than Cimetidine, which may be related to its greater non-toxic concentrations. Copyright © 2021 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",Included
325,"Laparotomy-staged IA versus IIA Hodgkin's disease. A comparative study with evaluation of prognostic factors for stage IIA disease Ninety-one laparotomy-staged (LAP) IA and IIA Hodgkin's disease (HD) patients were analyzed to evaluate the prognostic significance of stage, mediastinal status, extranodal disease and histology. Forty IA patients were treated with radiotherapy (XRT) only; of 51 IIA patients, 44 received XRT only and 7 had additional chemotherapy. Disease-free survival (DFS) at 5 and 10 years was 81% and 70%, respectively, with overall survival (S) of 93% and 86%, respectively. Disease-free survival for IA patients (93% at 5 and 10 years) was significantly superior to IIA (73% at 5 years, 52% at 10 years). Survival differences were not statistically significant. For IIA patients receiving XRT only, large mediastinal disease was an adverse factor for DFS. Small mediastinal disease in IIA was significantly better than no mediastinal disease. For the whole group of LAP IA and IIA treated by XRT only, three prognostic groups were identified: (1) Stage IA and Stage IIA with mediastinal disease, but less than 7.5 cm in width was highly favorable with less than 10% relapse; (2) Stage IIA nonmediastinal had an intermediate prognosis with relapse in about 33%; (3) Stage IIA large mediastinal (greater than or equal to 7.5 cm) had an unfavorable DFS with relapse in about 55%. The third group contained a highly unfavorable subset with mediastinal masses greater than 10 cm, all of whom relapsed. Salvage therapy was successful in 60% of relapsing patients. In the context of relatively effective salvage therapy, the role of adjuvant chemotherapy in adverse prognostic groups is discussed and it is concluded that the only clearly justifiable use for adjuvant chemotherapy is in patients with massive (greater than 10 cm) mediastinal adenopathy.",Excluded
336,"Dose escalation via brachytherapy boost for nasopharyngeal carcinoma in the era of intensity-modulated radiation therapy and combined chemotherapy To investigate if dose escalation using intracavitary brachytherapy (ICBT) improves local control for nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) in the era of intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) and concurrent chemoradiation treatment (CCRT). We retrospectively analyzed 232 patients with Stage T1-3 N0-3 M0 NPC who underwent definitive IMRT with or without additional ICBT boost between 2002 and 2013. For most of the 124 patients who had ICBT boost, the additional brachytherapy was given as 6 Gy in 2 fractions completed within 1 week after IMRT of 70 Gy. CCRT with or without adjuvant chemotherapy was used for 176 patients, including 88 with and 88 without ICBT boost, respectively. The mean follow-up time was 63.1 months. The 5-year overall survival and local control rates were 81.5% and 91.5%, respectively. ICBT was not associated with local control prediction (P = 0.228). However, in a subgroup analysis, 75 T1 patients with ICBT boost had significantly better local control than the other 71 T1 patients without ICBT boost (98.1% vs 85.9%, P = 0.020), despite having fewer patients who had undergone chemotherapy (60.0% vs 76.1%, P = 0.038). Multivariate analysis showed that both ICBT (P = 0.029) and chemotherapy (P = 0.047) influenced local control for T1 patients. Our study demonstrated that dose escalation with ICBT can improve local control of the primary tumor for NPC patients with T1 disease treated with IMRT, even without chemotherapy.

260,"Clinical use of 80-KV tube voltage for coronary computed tomographic angiography among patients with low body mass index Introduction: The use of 80-kilovoltage (kV) tube voltage to reduce radiation exposure during coronary CT angiography has not been well studied. Method(s): We retrospectively identified 17 symptomatic patients without known coronary disease who were clinically referred for CCTA using 80 kV tube voltage. All patients were scanned using a 64-slice scanner. Two experienced readers assessed image quality within each coronary segment using a standard 18-segment model. Segments were graded on a 1-4 quality scale (4, excellent quality without artifacts 3, good quality with minor artifacts 2, adequate quality for stenosis assessment; 1, uninterpretable). In addition, signal (mean Hounsfield intensity of the left main coronary origin), noise (standard deviation of the signal), contrast (mean signal - subcutaneous adipose tissue signal), and obstructive (>= 50%) stenosis were assessed. Bismuth in-plane breast shielding was used in all female patients per institutional protocol. Result(s): Table 1 provides group data. The cohort consisted of predominantly young males with a mean BMI of 23 kg/m2 and mean pre-scan heart rate of 53 bpm. Mean image quality score was 2.9 +/- 0.3 and 94% (16/17) of scans were deemed adequate for interpretation (no uninterpretable segments). One scan was deemed inadequate for diagnostic purposes secondary to poor image quality (signal 448 HU) and poor pre-scan heart rate control (68 bpm). All female patients had diagnostic image quality. The mean total radiation dose for the coronary CTA was 0.6+/-0.1 millisieverts and total radiation exposure for the entire study (including timing bolus and scout images) was 1.3+/-0.7 mSv. Compared to previously reported studies and studies within our institution using 100kV tube voltage, noise levels in the current study were significantly higher. Conclusion(s): In this small sample, the clinical application of CCTA using 80 kV achieved very low radiation exposure with high diagnostic yield despite higher levels of image noise.

939,"Construction of a radiation hybrid panel and the first yellowtail (Seriola quinqueradiata) radiation hybrid map using a nanofluidic dynamic array BACKGROUND: Yellowtail (Seriola quinqueradiata) are an economically important species in Japan. However, there are currently no methods for captive breeding and early rearing for yellowtail. Thus, the commercial cultivation of this species is reliant upon the capture of wild immature fish. Given this, there is a need to develop captive breeding techniques to reduce pressure on wild stocks and facilitate the sustainable development of yellowtail aquaculture. We constructed a whole genome radiation hybrid (RH) panel for yellowtail gene mapping and developed a framework physical map using a nanofluidic dynamic array to use SNPs (single nucleotide polymorphisms) in ESTs (expressed sequence tags) for the DNA-assisted breeding of yellowtail., RESULTS: Clonal RH cell lines were obtained after ionizing radiation; specifically, 78, 64, 129, 55, 42, and 53 clones were isolated after treatment with 3,000, 4,000, 5,000, 6,000, 8,000, or 10,000 rads, respectively. A total of 421 hybrid cell lines were obtained by fusion with mouse B78 cells. Ninety-four microsatellite markers used in the genetic linkage map were genotyped using the 421 hybrid cell lines. Based upon marker retention and genome coverage, we selected 93 hybrid cell lines to form an RH panel. Importantly, we performed the first genotyping of yellowtail markers in an RH panel using a nanofluidic dynamic array (Fluidigm, CA, USA). Then, 580 markers containing ESTs and SNPs were mapped in the first yellowtail RH map., CONCLUSIONS: We successfully developed a yellowtail RH panel to facilitate the localization of markers. Using this, a framework RH map was constructed with 580 markers. This high-density physical map will serve as a useful tool for the identification of genes related to important breeding traits using genetic structural information, such as conserved synteny. Moreover, in a comparison of 30 sequences in the RH group 1 (SQ1), yellowtail appeared to be evolutionarily closer to medaka and the green-spotted pufferfish than to zebrafish. We suggest that synteny analysis may be potentially useful as a tool to investigate chromosomal evolution by comparison with model fish.",Excluded
191,"Postoperative clinical radiosensitivity in patients with Fanconi anemia and head and neck squamous cell carcinoma Objective: To describe the complications and adverse effects of postoperative radiotherapy in patients with Fanconi anemia (FA). Design(s): Cohort study. Setting(s): Patients with FA treated at community and tertiary care hospitals throughout the United States. Patient(s): The study included patients with FA whowere enrolled in the International FA Registry (IFAR) and who developed head and neck squamous cell carcinoma and received postoperative radiotherapy. Main Outcome Measure(s): Demographics of patients with FA and adverse effects and dosages of radiotherapy. Result(s): Twelve patients with FA (7 men and 5 women) were identified. They developed cancers at a mean age of 35.5 years (age range, 20-48 years). The sites of primary cancer were the oral cavity (n=8), larynx (n=2), pharynx (n=1), and unknown (n=1). The median radiation dose was 5590 cGy (range, 2500-7020 cGy). The most common adverse effects were mucositis (n=9), dysphagia (n=8), and pancytopenia (n=6). Other complications included esophageal stenosis, laryngeal edema, and wound breakdown. Radiotherapy could not be completed in 5 cases. Overall, 8 patients died, 4 during the course of radiotherapy. The postoperative disease-free survival time ranged from 0 to 55 months. Conclusion(s): Patients with FA have a high rate of complications from radiotherapy. Common adverse effects, particularly mucositis, are especially prevalent and difficult to manage in this population. Pancytopenia is common and may lead to further complications, particularly bleeding and infection. Overall survival is poor. Further study of the response to radiotherapy in patients with FA should be attempted to establish appropriate dosages to balance treating disease while limiting adverse effects. ©2011 American Medical Association.

Background: Stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) is an important option for patients with cavernous sinus meningiomas. Objective(s): To evaluate cranial nerve outcomes in patients who underwent SRS for cavernous sinus meningiomas with or without prior microsurgery. Method(s): During a 23-year interval, 272 patients underwent Gamma Knife SRS for cavernous sinus meningiomas (70 men, 202 women; median age, 54 years). In this series, 99 patients underwent prior microsurgical resection. The median tumor volume was 7.9 cm and median marginal dose was 13 Gy. The median follow-up period was 62 months (range, 6-209 months). Result(s): The progression-free survival after SRS was 96% at 3 years, 94% at 5 years, and 86% at 10 years. After SRS, 13 of 91 patients (14%) who underwent prior microsurgery had improvement of preexisting cranial nerve symptoms or signs. In comparison, 54 of 145 patients (37%) without prior microsurgery had improvement of preexisting cranial nerve symptoms or signs. The improvement rate of cranial nerve deficits after SRS in patients without prior microsurgery was 20% at 1 year, 34% at 2 years, 36% at 3 years, and 39% at 5 years. Patients who had not undergone prior microsurgery had significantly higher improvement rates of preexisting cranial nerve symptoms and signs (P = .001). After SRS, 29 patients (11%) developed new or worsened cranial nerve function. Conclusion(s): SRS provided long-term effective tumor control and a low risk of new cranial nerve deficits.

They received adjuvant radiotherapy to the gastric bed and draining lymphatic nodes in a total dose of 50.4 Gy in 28 fractions and chemotherapy with continuous infusion 5-FU, 200 mg/m2/day. Results were compared to historical controls matched according to demographic parameters and tumor characteristics. Result(s): Eighteen patients were in stage II, 10 in stage IIIA, nine in stage IIIB and four in stage IVA. Twelve patients had an N0 nodal status, 15 were N1, nine were N2 and five were N3. After a mean follow up of 32 months, 26 patients (63%) were alive. Five year overall survival was 49.6% for surgery plus radiochemotherapy compared to 30.7% for the historical group subjected only to surgery (p =0.002). Radiotherapy was associated with grade 1-2 toxicity and treatment was completed without interruptions in all patients. Chemotherapy was delayed temporarily in 3 patients. Conclusion(s): Adjuvant radio-chemotherapy improved overall survival in gastric cancer, compared to historical controls subjected only to surgical treatment.",Excluded
92,"DPYD, TYMS, TYMP, TK1, and TK2 genetic expressions as response markers in locally advanced rectal cancer patients treated with fluoropyrimidine-based chemoradiotherapy This study is to investigate multiple chemotherapeutic agent- and radiation-related genetic biomarkers in locally advanced rectal cancer (LARC) patients following fluoropyrimidine-based concurrent chemoradiotherapy (CCRT) for response prediction. We initially selected 6 fluoropyrimidine metabolism-related genes (DPYD, ORPT, TYMS, TYMP, TK1, and TK2) and 3 radiotherapy response-related genes (GLUT1, HIF-1 alpha, and HIF-2 alpha) as targets for gene expression identification in 60 LARC cancer specimens. Subsequently, a high-sensitivity weighted enzymatic chip array was designed and constructed to predict responses following CCRT. After CCRT, 39 of 60 (65%) LARC patients were classified as responders (pathological tumor regression grade 2 ~ 4). Using a panel of multiple genetic biomarkers (chip), including DPYD, TYMS, TYMP, TK1, and TK2, at a cutoff value for 3 positive genes, a sensitivity of 89.7% and a specificity of 81% were obtained (AUC: 0.915; 95% CI: 0.840-0.991). Negative chip results were significantly correlated to poor CCRT responses (TRG 0-1) (P = 0.014, hazard ratio: 22.704, 95% CI: 3.055-235.448 in multivariate analysis). Disease-free survival analysis showed significantly better survival rate in patients with positive chip results (P = 0.0001). We suggest that a chip including DPYD, TYMS, TYMP, TK1, and TK2 genes is a potential tool to predict response in LARC following fluoropyrimidine-based CCRT. © 2013 Ming-Yii Huang et al.",Excluded
909,"Evaluation of focal thyroid lesions incidentally detected in F- 18 fluorodeoxyglucose PET/CT images AIM: Increased uptake in the thyroid gland (TG) is often identified as an incidental finding on whole-body F-18 Fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography/computed tomography (FDG-PET/CT) in the non-thyroid cancer (NTC) patients. Currently, there is no consensus on the appropriate approach for management of these cases. Thyroid ultrasound, scintigraphy and fine-needle aspiration biopsy (FNAB) are suggested to exclude malignant thyroid lesions. Our aim is to determine the importance of increased F-18 FDG uptake in TG on PET/CT in patients who are being screened for various NTC and to recommend a diagnostic strategy to identify patients with high risk of thyroid malignancy. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We evaluated 1086 cases undergoing whole-body PET/CT scan between April 2011 and April 2012. Images with incidental focal FDG uptake in TG were identified. Data of the age, sex, type of primary cancer, maximum standard uptake value (SUVmax), size of thyroid nodules and cervical lymph nodes (CLN) on F-18 FDG-PET/CT images, and if avalaible, FNAB results were evaluated. RESULT(S): 28 of 1086 patients (2.5%) showed a focal increased F-18 FDG uptake of lesions in TG (14 men, 14 women, mean age+/-SD, 60.29+/-13 years) and the SUVmax value ranged from 1.50 to 18.00 (average SUVmax: 4.19+/-3.41). Thyroid lesions ranged in diameter from 7.0 to 55.0 milimeter (mean+/-SD:16.47+/-11.80mm). The CLN were detected in 11/28 patients (39%). The average SUVmax in CLN was 4.04+/-1.80, the mean CLN diameter was 10.13+/-2.95mm. Twelve of 28 patients (43%) were done FNAB, and the final histopathological diagnosis was malign thyroid nodules in five patient (avarage SUVmax 6.84+/-6.37 and nodule diameter 31.26+/-22.11mm), benign thyroid disease in five patient (avarage SUVmax 3.95+/-1.48 and nodule diameter 9.60+/-2.30mm) and limited and unsufficient materials in two patients. Sixteen patients did not undergo any diagnostic test. CONCLUSION(S): Focal increased FDG uptake in TG incidentally identified on FDG-PET/CT occurred at a frequency of 2.5% and this finding may be associated with an increased risk of malignancy, but the clinical significance is unclear. More data are needed to elucidate the role of SUV in the differentiation of benign and malign thyroid lesions. Clinicians should take into consideration incidentally detected PET/CT findings. Thyroid scintigraphy and, if cold nodule is present, FNAB should be suggested to clinicians for definitive diagnosis.",Excluded
308,"Preclinical evaluation of dual-energy imaging for lung tumor image guided radiotherapy Purpose/Objective(s): Dual energy (DE) imaging is routinely used in diagnostic radiology to produce tissue-selective x-ray images. DE imaging uses two different energies, such as 120kVp and 60 kVp. By performing a weighted subtraction of the logarithm of these images, subtraction images can be created to enhance either soft tissue or bone. In the lung, DE imaging can be used to eliminate overlying bony anatomy to improve tumor visualization. The goal of this study was to evaluate the theoretical potential of DE imaging to improve localization of lung tumors in patients undergoing image guided radiotherapy (IGRT). Materials/Methods: Free-breathing planning CT scans of 20 patients with stage IA or IB NSCLC were evaluated for this study. Software was written to convert the Hounsfield units (HU) of the CT scans into attenuation coefficients for 60kV and 120 kV x-rays. Subsequently, digitally reconstructed radiographs (DRRs) were generated for each of these energies.Weighted subtraction was performed to create tissue selective subtraction images that highlight soft tissue. These soft tissue images were compared with the standard DRRs to evaluate tumor contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR). CNR represents the difference between the tumor signal and the background, divided by the standard deviation (noise) of these regions. Thus, CNR provides a quantitative measure of tumor visibility. Result(s): Qualitatively, DE subtraction resulted in the complete disappearance of bone and provided improved visualization of lung tumors on anterior-posterior DE-DRRs relative to standard DRRs. The average CNR for DE-DRRs was 5.74 +/- 1.85 vs 3.99 +/- 2.04 for standard DRRs, p<0.01. This represents an improvement of 44% in the CNR when using DE-DRRs. Of interest, the presence of breast tissue in female patients resulted in lower CNRs for both standard and DE-DRRs. In females (7 patients) the average CNR was 5.05 +/- 1.82 for DE-DRRs and 3.35 +/- 1.19 for standard DRRs, compared to 6.11 +/- 1.83 and 4.33 +/- 2.35 in males (13 patients), respectively. Despite the lower CNRs in female patients, the DE-DRRs represented an improvement of 51% over standard DRRs, which is comparable to the improvement in males of 41%. Conclusion(s): DE subtraction chest imaging that enhances soft tissue may improve target localization in lung cancer patients receiving kV-based IGRT planar imaging.We believe that this approach could improve daily localization as well as be used as part of an adaptive radiotherapy program. We are further investigating the use of DE subtraction imaging in this setting including an analysis of image acquisition dose to the patients.

356,"Increased circulating cell-free DNA levels and mtDNA fragments in interventional cardiologists occupationally exposed to low levels of ionizing radiation Circulating cell-free DNA (ccf-DNA) and mtDNA (ccf-mtDNA) have often been used as indicators of cell death and tissue damage in acute and chronic disorders, but little is known about changes in ccf-DNA and ccf-mtDNA concentrations following radiation exposure. The aim of the study was to investigate the impact of chronic low-dose radiation exposure on serum ccf-DNA levels and ccf-mtDNA fragments (mtDNA-79 and mtDNA-230) of interventional cardiologists working in high-volume cardiac catheterization laboratory to assess their possible role as useful radiation biomarkers. We enrolled 50 interventional cardiologists (26 males; age = 48.4 +/- 10 years) and 50 age- and gender-matched unexposed controls (27 males; age = 47.6 +/- 8.3 years). Quant-iT TM dsDNA High-Sensitivity assay was used to measure circulating ccf-DNA isolated from serum samples. Quantitative analysis of mtDNA fragments was performed by real-time PCR. No significant relationships were found between ccf-DNA and ccf-mtDNA, and age, gender, smoking, or other clinical parameters. Ccf-DNA levels (44.2 +/- 31.1 vs. 30.6 +/- 19.2 ng/ml, P = 0.013), ccf-mtDNA-79 (2.6 +/- 2.1 vs. 1.1 +/- 0.8, P < 0.01), and ccf-mtDNA-230 copies (2.0 +/- 1.8 vs. 1.04 +/- 0.9, P = 0.02) were significantly higher in interventional cardiologists compared with the non-exposed group. In a subset (n = 15) of interventional cardiologists with a reliable reconstruction of cumulative professional exposure (59.7 +/- 48.4 mSv; range: 1.4-182 mS), ccf-DNA (53.2 +/- 41.3 vs. 36.4 +/- 22.9 and 32.2 +/- 20.5, P = 0.08), mtDNA-79 (2.4 +/- 2.1 vs. 2.03 +/- 1.7 and 1.09 +/- 0.82, P = 0.05), and mtDNA-230 (2.0 +/- 2.2 vs. 1.5 +/- 1.4 and 1.04 +/- 0.9, P = 0.09) tended to be significantly increased in high-exposure subjects compared with both low-exposure interventional cardiologists and controls. Our results provide evidence for a possible role of circulating DNA as a relevant biomarker of cellular damage induced by exposure to chronic low-dose radiation.

The objective of this study was to estimate the radiation absorbed doses of 18F-PBR06 based on biodistribution data in humans. Method(s): After the injection of 18F-PBR06, images were acquired from head to thigh in 7 healthy humans. Urine was collected at various time points. Radiation absorbed doses were estimated by the MIRD scheme. Result(s): Moderate to high levels of radioactivity were observed in organs with high densities of TSPO and in organs of metabolism and excretion. Bone had low levels of radioactivity. The effective dose was 18.5 muSv/MBq. Conclusion(s): The effective dose of 18F-PBR06, compared with other 18F radioligands, was moderate. This radioligand had negligible defluorination, as indirectly assessed by bone radioactivity. Doses to the gallbladder wall and spleen may limit the amount of permissible injected radioactivity.

29,"Schizophrenic patients are impaired in memory reinstatement underlying mismatch negativity system OBJECTIVE: We modified the paradigm used in the report of Cowan et al. [J Exp Psychol Learn Mem Cogn 19 (1993) 909] to investigate how the silent intervals influence the memory trace underlying mismatch negativity (MMN) generation in schizophrenic patients., METHODS: Experiment 1 was designed to explore how long an inter-train interval would be needed for the memory to become dormant. Experiment 2 was designed to elucidate how many standard stimuli would be needed to reinstate the memory., RESULTS: In Experiment 1, schizophrenic patients showed a significant reduction in MMN amplitude after the longer inter-train intervals compared to the shorter ones, although little difference was observed in controls. Specifically, the memory trace underlying the MMN system in the schizophrenic patients easily became dormant after the extended silent intervals. In Experiment 2, we could not conclude that schizophrenic patients needed more reminders than did controls in order to reinstate the memory once the memory trace became dormant. The patients might be little impaired with respect to forming the memory trace., CONCLUSIONS: In schizophrenic patients, the memory trace in MMN generation might easily become out of context after silent intervals. Patients could not effectively reinstate the memory that was put out of context by the extended silent interval., SIGNIFICANCE: This article provides some suggestions in terms of patients' difficulty encoding episodes and retrieving them within distinct contexts in preconscious processes.",Excluded

294,"Radiation-induced apoptosis varies among individuals and is modified by sex and age Purpose: Although there are considerable data on mechanisms of radiation-induced apoptosis in vitro and in animal models, little is known about functional variation in these pathways in humans. We sought to develop a tractable system to evaluate this. Material(s) and Method(s): Peripheral blood mononuclear cells were isolated from 90 healthy volunteers, divided into two aliquots, one irradiated with a 5 Gy dose and the other sham-treated (0 Gy), and assessed for damage-induced apoptosis after 24 hours. To investigate reproducibility, 10 individuals spanning the entire radiation-induced apoptotic range were tested three times each, with 3-6 months between replicates. Result(s): We observed surprising heterogeneity in apoptosis among individuals, ranging from 21-62%. Biological replicates from a single individual, however, were completely concordant, suggesting the variability observed across individuals is not the result of stochastic or short-term effects. We found significantly higher radiation-induced apoptosis in males than in females (Mean: 41.0% vs. 30.7%; p < 3.5 x 10<sup>-7</sup>). Moreover, advancing age was associated with decreasing radiation-induced apoptosis in males (p = 0.01) but not females (p = 0.82). Conclusion(s): Our results provide evidence that the function of cellular pathways crucial for stress-induced apoptosis varies by sex and could decline with age in humans.

We compared the PET findings with computed tomography (CT), which was available in 21 (55%) patients, and tabulated the changes in the diagnostic evaluation and therapeutic management that were prompted by PET during a follow-up period of 10 to 36 months., RESULTS: Compared with PET, the extent of disease was underestimated by CT in 5 (13%) patients. Planned surgical resection of metastases was canceled in two of these patients. In another patient, surveillance PET detected an unsuspected hypermetabolic abdominal mass that was noted on a subsequent CT to arise from the small bowel. The mass was found to be jejunal metastatic melanoma at the time of resection. Overall, PET influenced surgical management in 3 (8%) patients, but it did not affect the wait-and-watch strategy or decision to initiate immunotherapy in the others., CONCLUSIONS: FDG PET contributes important information not provided by CT and has a substantial effect on the clinical management of patients with malignant melanoma.",Excluded
365,"Refining the criteria for immediate total-body CT after severe trauma OBJECTIVES: Initial trauma care could potentially be improved when conventional imaging and selective CT scanning is omitted and replaced by immediate total-body CT (iTBCT) scanning. Because of the potentially increased radiation exposure by this diagnostic approach, proper selection of the severely injured patients is mandatory., METHODS: In the REACT-2 trial, severe trauma patients were randomized to iTBCT or conventional imaging and selective CT based on predefined criteria regarding compromised vital parameters, clinical suspicion of severe injuries, or high-risk trauma mechanisms in five trauma centers. By logistic regression analysis with backward selection on the 15 study inclusion criteria, a revised set of criteria was derived and subsequently tested for prediction of severe injury and shifts in radiation exposure., RESULTS: In total, 1083 patients were enrolled with median ISS of 20 (IQR 9-29) and median GCS of 13 (IQR 3-15). Backward logistic regression resulted in a revised set consisting of nine original and one adjusted criteria. Positive predictive value improved from 76% (95% CI 74-79%) to 82% (95% CI 80-85%). Sensitivity decreased by 9% (95% CI 7-11%). The area under the receiver operating characteristics curve remained equal and was 0.80 (95% CI 0.77-0.83), original set 0.80 (95% CI 0.77-0.83). The revised set retains 8.78 mSv (95% CI 6.01-11.56) for 36% of the non-severely injured patients., CONCLUSIONS: Selection criteria for iTBCT can be reduced from 15 to 10 clinically criteria. This improves the positive predictive value for severe injury and reduces radiation exposure for less severely injured patients., KEY POINTS: * Selection criteria for iTBCT can be reduced to 10 clinically useful criteria. * This reduces radiation exposure in 36% of less severely injured patients. * Overall discriminative capacity for selection of severely injured patients remained equal.",Excluded

158,"Repeated ultraviolet exposure affords the same protection against DNA photodamage and erythema in human skin types II and IV but is associated with faster DNA repair in skin type IV We have investigated the photoprotective properties of induced pigmentation using erythema and epidermal DNA photodamage as endpoints. Previously unexposed buttock skin of 12 young, healthy adults (six skin type II and six skin type IV) was exposed daily (Monday to Friday) for 2 wk (days 1-12) with 0.65 minimal erythema dose of solar simulated radiation. Mean skin type IV minimal erythema dose was 1.8-fold greater than for skin type II. Compared to skin type II, solar simulated radiation treatments produced less erythema and more tanning in skin type IV. To assess DNA photodamage, biopsies were taken and prepared for paraffin sections that were stained with a monoclonal antibody for thymine dimers. Thymine dimers were quantified by image analysis. The single exposure data (0.65 and 2 minimal erythema dose) showed that DNA damage was related to physical dose (J per cm2) independent of skin type. Our data also showed that DNA photo-damage accumulates in both skin types with repeated, suberythemal doses of solar simulated radiation. On day 12, there were more thymine dimers in skin type IV than skin type II, again indicating that physical rather than biologic dose determines the level of DNA damage. Comparisons on days 12 and 19, however, showed a much greater loss of thymine dimers in skin type IV, suggesting better thymine dimer repair. Protection factors for erythema and thymine dimers were calculated and shown to be about 2 in both skin types. This provides further indirect evidence that DNA is a chromophore for erythema, but also suggests that a tan may not be the major factor in natural photoprotection.",Excluded
504,"Regulation of the metastasis of murine ocular melanoma by natural killer cells In the current study we examine parameters affecting the metastasis of ocular tumors of in vivo derived B16F10 melanoma. In C57BL/6J beige (bg/bg) mice, with low NK activity, metastasis to the lungs was increased and survival time decreased. In C57BL/6J normal (+/+) mice treatment with PK136, a highly specific monoclonal anti-NK antibody (Ab), caused a depletion of NK cytotoxic activity, as demonstrated using a standard 51Cr release assay. In animals bearing ocular tumors, treatment with PK136 Ab resulted in significantly increased pulmonary metastasis and an altered pattern of metastasis. The effect of combined treatment protocols using LS2616 (linomide) and cyclophosphamide (Cy) was examined in enucleated and unenucleated animals. Treatment with LS2616 and Cy resulted in a significant decrease in mean pulmonary metastases (MPM), a decreased frequency of metastasis to the submandibular lymph nodes and an increase in mean survival time. In enucleated mice this combined treatment protocol resulted in apparent cures, the lowest MPM and the longest survival time observed. When tumor-bearing mice were treated with either silica, carrageenan or sublethal gamma irradiation, no effect on metastasis or survival was observed.

981,"Reducing radiation exposure during invasive coronary angiography and percutaneous coronary interventions implementing a simple four-step protocol Background: With an increasing number of complex and repeated percutaneous coronary interventions (PCI), radiation-induced hazards for patients and operators remain an important issue in fluoroscopy-guided procedures. Our objective was to evaluate radiation exposure during coronary angiographic procedures and assess the efficacy of a four-step program to reduce radiation exposure during coronary angiography (CAG) and PCI. Methods and Results: A retrospective single-center analysis was performed in patients undergoing CAG or PCI in the first 6 months of 2012 vs. the first 6 months of 2014 (n = 3,107 procedures). During 2013, a four-step protocol was established in our hospital. It contained measures to reduce radiation exposure, including a frame rate reduction from 15 to 7.5 frames per second, the use of fluoroscopy storage, strict use of beam collimation, and repeat training on radiation safety. After adjustment for confounding variables, a dose-area product (DAP) reduction of 54.2 % was observed subsequent to implementation of the four-step protocol. Independent predictors of DAP were age [odds ratio (OR) 1.01], body surface area (OR 5.47), prior coronary artery bypass grafting (OR 1.44), radial access (OR 1.16), PCI (OR 2.36), female gender (OR 0.91), and the implementation of the four-step program (OR 0.46). Conclusion(s): A simple four-step protocol led to a significant reduction in radiation exposure in diagnostic and interventional coronary procedures without significant drawbacks in image quality. Hence, radiation safety programs are of paramount importance and should be established to improve patient and operator safety with regard to radiation-induced hazards.Copyright © 2015, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.",Excluded
173,"Resistance exercise as a countermeasure to disuse-induced bone loss During spaceflight, skeletal unloading results in loss of bone mineral density (BMD). This occurs primarily in the spine and lower body regions. This loss of skeletal mass could prove hazardous to astronauts on flights of long duration. In this study, intense resistance exercise was used to test whether a training regimen would prevent the loss of BMD that accompanies disuse. Nine subjects (5 men, 4 women) participated in a supine maximal resistance exercise training program during 17 wk of horizontal bed rest. These subjects were compared with 18 control subjects (13 men, 5 women) who followed the same bed rest protocol without exercise. Determination of treatment effect was based on measures of BMD, bone metabolism markers, and calcium balance obtained before, during, and after bed rest. Exercisers and controls had significantly (P < 0.05) different means, represented by the respective following percent changes: lumbar spine BMD, +3% vs. -1%; total hip BMD, +1% vs. -3%; calcaneus BMD, +1% vs. -9%; pelvis BMD, -0.5% vs. -3%; total body BMD, 0% vs. -1%; bone-specific alkaline phosphatase, +64% vs. 0%; alkaline phosphatase, +31% vs. +5%; osteocalcin, +43% vs. +10%; 1,25 dihydroxyvitamin D, +12% vs. -15%; parathyroid hormone intact molecule, +18% vs. -25%; and serum and ionized calcium, -1% vs. +1%. The difference in net calcium balance was also significant (+21 mg/day vs. -199 mg/day, exercise vs. control). The gastrocnemius and soleus muscle volumes decreased significantly in the exercise group, but the loss was significantly less than observed in the control group.

The exact cause of formation of a sialolith is still a matter of debate. The aim of this study was to analyze 6 sialoliths ultrastructurally to determine their development mechanism in the submandibular salivary glands. Six sialoliths retrieved from the hilus and duct of the submandibular salivary glands of 6 patients with sialadenitis were analyzed ultrastructurally by scanning electron microscope and x-ray diffractometer. Scanning electron microscope revealed mainly irregular, partly rudely hexagonal, needle-like and plate-shaped crystals. The cross-section from the surface to the inner part of the sialoliths showed no organic material. X-ray diffraction showed that the sialoliths were composed of hydroxyapatite crystals. Energy dispersive x-ray microanalysis showed that all of the samples contained high levels of Ca and P, and small amounts of Mg, Na, Cl, Si, Fe, and K. The main structures of the submandibular sialoliths were found to be hydroxyapatite crystals. No organic cores were observed in the central parts of the sialoliths.

Twenty-nine patients (68-93 years; 38-79 kg) with an estimated glomerular filtration rate of 12-49 ml/min underwent 80 kVp MDCT at a median dose of 200 mg iodine (I)/kg and 15 s injection time. Pulmonary artery (PA) enhancement where compared with our own reference material using 320 mg I/kg at 120 kVp and with reported figures in the literature at 120-140 kVp and a 42 g iodine CM dose. Median (1st and 3rd quartiles) values regarding CM dose were 12.2 (9.9-12.8) g iodine; density of left main and lower lobe segmental PA 339 (275-395) Hounsfield units (HU) and 354 (321-442) HU, respectively. Those enhancement values were similar to those obtained from the reference population at 120 kVp and those reported in the literature at 120-140 kVp. One patient had a transient increase in plasma creatinine. Three months' follow-up revealed deep venous thrombosis among 1/18 patients with negative results from computed tomography (CT). We conclude that 80 kVp 16-channel MDCT to diagnose PE in azotaemic patients may be performed with markedly reduced CM doses, implying a lesser risk for CM-induced nephropathy.",Excluded
1114,"Magnitude of luminance modulation specifies amplitude of perceived movement A compelling impression of movement, which is perceptually indistinguishable from a real displacement, can be elicited by patterns containing no spatially displaced elements. An apparent oscillation, w-movement, was generated by a stationary pattern containing a large number of horizontal pairs of spatially adjacent dots modulated in brightness. The observer's task was to adjust the perceived amplitude of the w-motion to match the amplitude of a real oscillation. All of the data can be accounted for by a simple rule: If the relative change in the luminance, W = delta L/L, between two adjacent stationary dots is kept constant, the distance over which these dots appeared to travel in space comprises a fixed fraction of the total distance by which they are separated. The apparent amplitude of the w-motion increases strictly in proportion with luminance contrast, provided that the contrast is represented in the motion-encoding system by a rapidly saturating compressive Weibull transformation. These findings can be explained in terms of bilocal motion encoders comparing two luminance modulations occurring at two different locations.",Excluded

LNs inside the irradiation field are affected by CRT, whereas those outside the irradiation field are affected only by concurrent chemotherapy., PATIENTS AND METHODS: The study cohort comprised of 210 patients with clinical stage II/III rectal adenocarcinoma. One hundred and eight received surgery alone (S group), and 102 received preoperative CRT (40 or 45 Gy) with concurrent oral UFT or S-1 uracil/tegafur or S-1 (CRT group)., RESULTS: The number of LNs inside the irradiation field was significantly smaller in the CRT group (4 +/- 4) than in the S group (6 +/- 6, p<0.01), but the number of LNs outside the irradiation field did not differ (5 +/- 4 in both groups). The longest diameters of LNs in the S group were significantly smaller than those of the CRT group both inside and outside the irradiation fields (p<0.01)., CONCLUSION: The effects of CRT on LNs in patients with rectal adenocarcinoma differed inside and outside the radiation field.

934,"The role of curative radiotherapy in the treatment of lung cancer From 1963-1974, 141 patients with lung cancer were treated with curative intent in the A. Maxwell Evans Clinic in Vancouver. The clinical presentation, age and sex distribution, histology, and reasons for surgery not being carried out are examined. The results of this treatment are presented. An attempt has been made to isolate a group of patients who have a better prognosis so that treatment selection can be improved. Hemoptysis, cough, dyspnea, and incidental finding on routine chest x-ray were the most common manner of presentation. Thirty-four percent of the patients were over 70 years of age and 13% were women. The crude overall three- and five-year survival rates were 18 and 10% (19 and 9% in the men, 17 and 14% in the women). Patients presenting with dyspnea had a better survival than those presenting with cough and hemoptysis. Patients with lesions less than 3 cm in diameter had a 28% three-year survival, compared with 14% for lesions greater than 5 cm in diameter. The three- and five-year survival rates in patients over 70 years of age were 23 and 17% respectively. The response to treatment and the survival was better in the patients with squamous cell carcinoma. Twenty-two percent were alive at three years and 12% at five years as compared with 9 and 5% for other histologies. Fifty-four percent of the 35 patients with a complete response and with squamous cell carcinoma were alive at three years, compared with only 8% of the 12 patients with other histologies who showed a complete response.",Excluded
906,"The characteristics of esophagogastric junction contractile index in patients with gastroesophageal reflux disease or functional heartburn OBJECTIVE: To study the role of esophagogastric junction contractile index (EGJ-CI) in evaluating the function of anti-reflux barrier, and in differentiating patients with gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) from those with functional heartburn (FH)., METHODS: A total of 115 patients presenting heartburn were enrolled in the study from January 2012 to June 2015.All subjects had completed Gerd-Q questionnaire and undergone gastroscopy, 24-hour pH-impedance monitoring and esophageal high-resolution manometry. GERD patients were divided into as reflux esophagitis, acid-nonerosive reflux disease (NERD) and weakly acid-NERD groups. Patients with normal esophageal mucosa, normal acid exposure and negative proton pump inhibitor test were enrolled in FH group. EGJ-CI (mmHg.cm) as well as EGJ rest pressure and 4s integrated relaxation pressure (IRP 4s) were measured., RESULTS: Among the 115 patients, 18 were reflux esophagitis [(49.0+/-18.9) years, M:F=10:8], 25 were acid-NERD [(48.7+/-14.4) years, M:F=13:12], 37 were weakly acid-NERD [(52.0+/-14.8) years, M:F=15:22] and 35 were FH [(53.6+/-14.8), M:F=8:27]. No differences of Gerd-Q scores were noticed between the four groups. (1)Negative correlations were demonstrated between EGJ-CI and esophageal acid exposure time (r=-0.283, P=0.002), EGJ-CI and acid reflux events (r=-0.233, P=0.012), EGJ-CI and weakly acid reflux events (r=-0.213, P=0.022), EGJ-CI and non-acid reflux events (r=-0.200, P=0.032). (2)The value of EGJ-CI was significantly higher in FH patients than in the three subgroups of GERD(all P<0.01). EGJ rest pressure of FH group was higher than that of acid-NERD (P<0.01). IRP 4s in acid-NERD group was lower than that of FH and weakly acid-NERD (P<0.05). (3)The area under curve (AUC) of EGJ-CI was higher than that of EGJ-CIT, EGJ rest pressure or IRP 4s(0.686 vs 0.678, 0.641 and 0.578). The cut-off value of EGJ-CI to differentiate GERD from FH was 9.74 mmHg.cm with sensitivity 82.86% and specificity 51.52%., CONCLUSIONS: The EGJ-CI values are negatively correlated with esophageal acid exposure time, weakly acid reflux events and non-acid reflux events. Thus it might be used as a metric to reflect the anti-reflux function of EGJ. According to the cut-off value of EGJ-CI 9.74 mmHg.cm, patients with GERD can be sensitively differentiated from patients with FH.",Excluded
969,"Treatment of haemorrhagic radiation-induced proctopathy using small volume topical formalin instillation BACKGROUND: Between 2 and 5% of patients undergoing pelvic radiotherapy develop chronic radiation proctopathy, occurring as a result of damage to the rectal mucosa during the treatment. Rectal bleeding of varying severity can occur as a consequence. There have been no formal trials of treatment for haemorrhagic radiation proctopathy and a variety of methods are currently used., AIM: In a retrospective study of 20 patients treated at a single centre, we assessed the efficacy of small volume topical formalin instillation to control bleeding from radiation proctopathy., METHOD: Patients were treated by a single operator using 20 mL of a 5% solution of formalin instilled into the rectum via a flexible sigmoidoscope for 3 min. Patients were followed up for an average of 22.7 months (range: 2-69)., RESULTS: A single session of formalin treatment was effective in 13 of 20 (65%) patients and a further four (20%) patients responded to a second treatment. No complications of the treatment was identified., CONCLUSION: Small volume formalin instillation therapy appears to be safe and effective in the context of haemorrhagic radiation proctopathy. The technique is simple, inexpensive, quick and requires no sedation. We suggest that it should be considered as a first line for patients presenting with this distressing condition.",Excluded
279,"Role for the mammalian Swi5-Sfr1 complex in DNA strand break repair through homologous recombination In fission yeast, the Swi5-Sfr1 complex plays an important role in homologous recombination (HR), a pathway crucial for the maintenance of genomic integrity. Here we identify and characterize mammalian Swi5 and Sfr1 homologues. Mouse Swi5 and Sfr1 are nuclear proteins that form a complex in vivo and in vitro. Swi5 interacts in vitro with Rad51, the DNA strand-exchange protein which functions during HR. By generating Swi5(-/-) and Sfr1(-/-) embryonic stem cell lines, we found that both proteins are mutually interdependent for their stability. Importantly, the Swi5-Sfr1 complex plays a role in HR when Rad51 function is perturbed in vivo by expression of a BRC peptide from BRCA2. Swi5(-/-) and Sfr1(-/-) cells are selectively sensitive to agents that cause DNA strand breaks, in particular ionizing radiation, camptothecin, and the Parp inhibitor olaparib. Consistent with a role in HR, sister chromatid exchange induced by Parp inhibition is attenuated in Swi5(-/-) and Sfr1(-/-) cells, and chromosome aberrations are increased. Thus, Swi5-Sfr1 is a newly identified complex required for genomic integrity in mammalian cells with a specific role in the repair of DNA strand breaks.",Excluded
214,"A case-control study of nasopharyngeal carcinoma in the high background radiation areas of Yangjiang, China The main purposes of this study were to identify the major determinants of nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) in the high-background radiation areas (HBRA) in Yangjiang, China and to evaluate their potential confounding effects on the NPC risk associated with exposure to high background radiation. A matched case-control study was conducted using those who died of NPC during the period 1987-1995. Two controls were randomly selected for each case from those who died from causes other than malignancies and external causes. Cases and their controls were matched with respect to sex and the years of birth and death (+/- 5 years). Study subjects' next-of-kin were interviewed using a standardized questionnaire to collect information on socioeconomic status, dietary habits, tobacco smoking and alcohol consumption, disease history, pesticide use, medical X-ray exposure, the family history of NPC and so on. We succeeded in interviewing 97 cases and 192 controls. Univariate conditional logistic regression analysis showed that NPC risk was associated with the consumption of salted fish, homemade pickles, and fermented soy beans, education levels, the history of chronic rhinitis, and the family history of NPC. Multivariate conditional logistic regression analysis revealed that education levels (Odds ratio (OR) for middle school or higher levels vs. no school education = 3.8, 95% CI = 1.2 to 11.8), salted fish intake (OR = 3.2, 95% CI = 1.7 to 6.1), the history of chronic rhinitis (OR = 3.6, 95% CI = 1.3 to 10.1), and the family history of NPC (OR = 14.2, 95% CI = 2.7 to 73.4) were independent risk factors of NPC. Tobacco smoking (OR = 1.2, 95% CI = 0.7 to 2.1), and alcohol consumption (OR = 0.9, 95% CI = 0.5 to 1.9) were not significantly related to NPC risk. The ORs of NPC risk comparing HBRA and a nearby control area before and after adjustment for the major risk determinants identified in the present study were 0.86 (95% CI = 0.50 to 1.50) and 0.87 (95% CI = 0.45 to 1.67), respectively. Salted fish intake was a strong risk factor of NPC. Education, the history of chronic rhinitis and the family history of NPC were also related to NPC risk. The exposure to high background radiation in HBRA of Yangjiang was not related to NPC risk with or without the adjustment for those major risk determinants of NPC.",Excluded
1134,"Superficial Femoral Artery Intervention by Single Transpedal Arterial Access BACKGROUND: Atherosclerotic disease of the superficial femoral artery (SFA) is frequently seen and can be treated with percutaneous interventions, traditionally via femoral artery access. There are limited reports of transpedal artery access for peripheral artery interventions, but none to date describing routine primary transpedal artery approach for SFA stenting. METHOD(S): In this preliminary study, we report 4 patients who underwent successful endovascular SFA stenting using a single transpedal artery access via a new ultra-low profile 6 Fr sheath (Glidesheath Slender; Terumo Corporation). RESULT(S): All patients underwent successful SFA stenting without complication. Procedure time varied from 51 to 72 minutes. The mean contrast amount used was 56 mL; mean fluoroscopy time was 21 minutes; mean radiation dose was 91 mGy. At 1-month follow-up, duplex ultrasonography showed that all pedal arteries had remained patent. CONCLUSION(S): Transpedal artery approach as a primary approach to SFA stenting appears feasible and safe. Comparative trials with standard percutaneous femoral approach are warranted.",Excluded
269,"Late radiation side-effects in three patients undergoing parotid irradiation for benign disease We report three patients in whom standard radiation therapy was given and serious late radiation damage was seen. The first patient suffered recurrent parotiditis and a parotid fistula. He was treated initially with 20 Gy in ten fractions via a 300 kV field. Further irradiation was required 1 year later and 40 Gy was given in 2 Gy fractions by an oblique anterior and posterior wedged photon pair. Ten years later he developed localized temporal bone necrosis. The second patient, with pleomorphic salivary adenoma, developed localized temporal bone necrosis 6 years after 60 Gy had been given using standard fractionation and technique. The third patient received 55 Gy in 25 fractions for a pleomorphic salivary adenoma and after 3 years developed temporal bone necrosis. Sixteen years later the same patient developed cerebellar and brainstem necrosis. All patients developed chronic persistent infection during or shortly after the radiation therapy, which increased local tissue sensitivity to late radiation damage. As a result, severe bone, cerebellar and brainstem necrosis was observed at doses that are normally considered safe. We therefore strongly recommend that any infection in a proposed irradiated area should be treated aggressively, with surgical debridement if necessary, before radiotherapy is administered, or that infection developing during or after irradiation is treated promptly.",Excluded
407,"Ultrasonography in assessing suspected bone fractures: a cross-sectional survey amongst German general practitioners BACKGROUND: Over the last two decades, ultrasonography (US) has been shown to be an accurate tool for the diagnosis of suspected bone fractures; however, the integration of this application of US into routine care and outpatient settings needs to be explored. In this study, we surveyed German general practitioners (GPs) to assess their knowledge, attitudes, and utilization of US for the diagnosis of suspected fractures.
METHODS: Notification of the study, a self-designed questionnaire, and a reminder were mailed to 600 randomly selected GPs in Saxony and Saxony-Anhalt.
RESULTS: The response rate was 47.7% (n = 286), and respondents did not differ from the population of all GPs in respect to sex and practice type. Among GPs surveyed, 48.6% used an US device in their practice. On average, GPs diagnosed six patients with suspected fractures per month, yet only 39.3% knew about the possibility of ultrasonographic fracture diagnosis, and only 4.3% of GPs using US applied it for this purpose. Among participants, 71.9% believed that US is inferior to conventional X-rays for the diagnosis of bony injuries. Users of US were better informed of and more commonly used US for fracture diagnosis compared to non-users.
CONCLUSION: The need to rule out possible fractures frequently arises in general practice, and US devices are broadly available. Further efforts are needed to improve the knowledge and attitudes of GPs regarding the accuracy of US for fracture diagnosis. Multicenter controlled trials could explore the safety, usefulness, and effectiveness of this still seldom used diagnostic approach for suspected fractures.",Excluded
339,"Prediction of survival by [18F]fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography in patients with locally advanced non-small-cell lung cancer undergoing definitive chemoradiation therapy: results of the ACRIN 6668/RTOG 0235 trial In this prospective National Cancer Institute-funded American College of Radiology Imaging Network/Radiation Therapy Oncology Group cooperative group trial, we hypothesized that standardized uptake value (SUV) on post-treatment [(18)F]fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) correlates with survival in stage III non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Patients received conventional concurrent platinum-based chemoradiotherapy without surgery; postradiotherapy consolidation chemotherapy was allowed. Post-treatment FDG-PET was performed at approximately 14 weeks after radiotherapy. SUVs were analyzed both as peak SUV (SUVpeak) and maximum SUV (SUVmax; both institutional and central review readings), with institutional SUVpeak as the primary end point. Relationships between the continuous and categorical (cutoff) SUVs and survival were analyzed using Cox proportional hazards multivariate models. Of 250 enrolled patients (226 were evaluable for pretreatment SUV), 173 patients were evaluable for post-treatment SUV analyses. The 2-year survival rate for the entire population was 42.5%. Pretreatment SUVpeak and SUVmax (mean, 10.3 and 13.1, respectively) were not associated with survival. Mean post-treatment SUVpeak and SUVmax were 3.2 and 4.0, respectively. Post-treatment SUVpeak was associated with survival in a continuous variable model (hazard ratio, 1.087; 95% CI, 1.014 to 1.166; P = .020). When analyzed as a prespecified binary value (<= v > 3.5), there was no association with survival. However, in exploratory analyses, significant results for survival were found using an SUVpeak cutoff of 5.0 (P = .041) or 7.0 (P < .001). All results were similar when SUVmax was used in univariate and multivariate models in place of SUVpeak. Higher post-treatment tumor SUV (SUVpeak or SUVmax) is associated with worse survival in stage III NSCLC, although a clear cutoff value for routine clinical use as a prognostic factor is uncertain at this time.",Excluded

24,"Assessment of periodontal changes in patients undergoing radiotherapy for head and neck malignancy: A hospital-based study Background: Surgical resection, radio and chemotherapy, either used singly or in combination, are the three most common modalities used in head and neck cancer treatment. These modalities are effective in eradicating the tumor; they also negatively impact the normal head and neck structures surrounding the tumor. Direct damage to the oral structures (soft and hard tissue) frequently occurs from radio and chemotherapy, and indirect damage may also arise from systemic toxicity. Material(s) and Method(s): This prospective study was designed to analyze the effect of radiotherapy on periodontal parameters in oncology patients prior to irradiation in the head and neck area, compared with 6 months following treatment. The statistical analysis was done using SPSS. Result(s): The study sample consisted of total 29 patients of head and neck malignancy (M = 17, F = 12), of mean age 45.66 years. Only 22% of patients had various habits (smoking, tobacco chewing, and alcohol consumption) and majority (27.59% patients) had tongue malignancy. All periodontal parameters-oral hygiene index Siller (OHIS), clinical attachment level (CAL), gingival recession (GR), except probing pocket depth (PPD)-were significantly increased after radiotherapy. When comparison was made between doses and fractions, only in mandible statistically significant difference were observed in GR. Conclusion(s): Although there was no significant change in PPD, there was increased GR, CAL, and plaque index associated with radiotherapy. In this study, 61.5% cases of mandibular teeth and 34.4% cases of maxillary teeth showed attachment loss greater than 0.2 mm. So, all patients with head and neck malignancy should undergo an oral examination before the initiation of cancer therapy with adequate prophylaxis.",Excluded
271,"Increased lung cancer risk due to residential radon in a pooled and extended analysis of studies in Germany Residential radon has been shown to be a risk factor for lung cancer in several studies-but with limited power in each single study. The data of two case-control studies performed during 1990-1997 in Germany and used for previous publications have been extended and pooled. Both studies have identical study designs. In total, data of 2,963 incident lung cancer cases and 4,232 population controls are analyzed here. One-year radon measurements were performed in houses occupied during the 5-35 y prior to the interview. Conditional logistic and linear relative risk regression was used for the analysis. Measurements covered on average 70% of the exposure time window, with an average radon exposure of 61 Bq m(-3). The smoking and asbestos-adjusted ORs were 0.97 [95% confidence interval (CI) 0.85 to 1.11] for 50-80 Bq m(-3), 1.06 (95% CI 0.87 to 1.30) for 80-140 Bq m(-3) and 1.40 (95% CI 1.03 to 1.89) for radon concentrations above 140 Bq m(-3), compared to the reference category <50 Bq m(-3). The linear increase in the odds ratio per 100 Bq m(-3) was 0.10 (95% CI -0.02 to 0.30) for all subjects and 0.14 (95% CI -0.03 to 0.55) for less mobile subjects who lived in only one home in the last 5-35 y. The risk coefficients generally were higher when measurement error in the radon concentrations was reduced by restricting the population. With respect to histopathology, the risk for small cell carcinoma was higher than for other subtypes.

82,"Role of salvage radiation therapy for patients with relapsed or refractory Hodgkin lymphoma who failed autologous stem cell transplant Purpose: To analyze, through chart review, the efficacy of salvage radiation therapy (sRT) for relapsed or progressive Hodgkin lymphoma (HL) patients who failed autologous stem cell transplant (ASCT). Patients and Methods: Among 347 patients with recurrent/refractory HL who received ASCT from 1986-2006, 163 had post-ASCT progression or relapse. Of these, 56 received sRT and form the basis of this report. Median age at sRT was 30 years (range, 17-59 years). Disease was confined to lymph nodes in 27 patients, whereas 24 had both nodal and extranodal disease. Salvage radiation therapy alone was given in 34 patients (61%), and sRT plus chemotherapy was given in 22 (39%). Median interval from ASCT to sRT was 0.8 years (range, 0.1-5.6 years). The median dose was 35 Gy (range, 8-40.3 Gy). The sRT technique was extended-field in 14 patients (25%) and involved-field in 42 (75%). Result(s): The median follow-up from sRT was 31.3 months (range, 0.2-205.5 months). Overall response rate was 84% (complete response: 36%; partial response: 48%). The median overall survival was 40.8 months (95% confidence interval, 34.2-56.3 months). The 5-year overall survival was 29% (95% confidence interval, 14%-44%). The 2-year progression-free survival (PFS) was 16%; the 2-year local PFS was 65%, whereas the 2-year systemic PFS was 17%. The 1-year PFS was higher in patients in whom all diseased sites were irradiated (49%) compared with those in whom only the symptomatic site was treated (22%, P=.07). Among 20 alive patients, 5 were disease free (at 6.4, 6.8, 7.4, 7.9, and 17.1 years). Conclusion(s): For patients with HL who fail ASCT, a selective use of RT provides a durable local control rate of 65% at 2 years and should be considered as part of the standard management plan for the palliation of incurable HL. Occasionally irradiation of truly localized disease can lead to long-term survival. © 2012 Elsevier Inc.",Excluded

420,"Effect of gamma radiation on resting B lymphocytes. II. Functional characterization of the antigen-presentation defect The effect of radiation on three discrete Ag-presentation functions in resting B cells was examined: 1) Ag uptake and processing, 2) expression of processed Ag in the context of functional class II molecules, and 3) provision of necessary co-stimulatory, or second,"" signals. Analysis of radiation's effect on B cell presentation of intact vs fragmented Ag or its effect on presentation by Ag-pulsed B cells indicated that damage to Ag uptake and processing could not account for the bulk of the radiation-induced Ag-presentation defect. Experiments with phosphatidylinositol hydrolysis as an indirect measure of TCR occupancy suggested that irradiation caused a fairly rapid (within 1 to 2 h) decrease in the ability of the B cell APC to display a stimulatory combination of Ag and class II molecule. Ag dose-response analyses demonstrated that when presenting a fragment of the Ag pigeon cytochrome c to a T cell clone, 3000 rad-treated B cell APC were able to stimulate approximately 50% as much phosphatidylinositol turnover as unirradiated B cells. It was also found that, in contrast to their inability to initiate T cell proliferation, and similarly to chemically cross-linked splenocytes, heavily irradiated resting B cells plus Ag induced a state of Ag hyporesponsiveness in T cell clones. This effect on T cells had the same Ag- and MHC-specificity as did receptor occupancy required for proliferation, indicating that heavily irradiated resting B cells bear functional class II molecules. Co-culture of T cells with allogeneic B cells and syngeneic heavily irradiated B cells or chemically cross-linked splenic APC plus Ag resulted in T cell proliferation and interfered with the induction of the hyporesponsive state. This co-stimulatory function was radiosensitive in resting allogeneic B cells. Together, these data support the hypothesis that the major functional consequences of radiation to resting B cell APC are a reduction in the effective display of Ag plus class II molecules and, probably what is more important, a loss in the ability to provide APC-derived co-stimulatory signals.""",Included

These results were compared to patients undergoing similar procedures in a cardiac catheterization laboratory without this technology., BACKGROUND: There is a safety priority in clinical care to reduce X-ray radiation dose to patients in order to lower the risk of deterministic and stochastic effects. Dose reduction technologies must be verified in clinical settings to prove if they reduce X-ray radiation dose and to what extent., METHODS: Radiation dose data and procedure characteristics of 268 consecutive patients were collected and analyzed from a cardiac catheterization laboratory with dose reduction technology installed (referred to as Lab A, n = 135) and from a cardiac catheterization laboratory without this technology (referred as Lab B, n = 133)., RESULTS: For diagnostic procedures, the median total dose-area product in Lab A was reduced by 46% (P < 0.0001) compared to Lab B, with no differences in terms of body mass index (P = 0.180), total fluoroscopy times (P = 1), number of acquired images (P = 0.920), and contrast medium (P = 0.660). For interventional procedures, the median total dose-area product in Lab A was reduced by 34% (P = 0.015) compared to Lab B, with no differences in terms of body mass index (P = 0.665), total fluoroscopy times (P = 0.765), number of acquired images (P = 0.923), and contrast medium (P = 0.969)., CONCLUSIONS: This new dose reduction technology significantly reduces X-ray radiation dose without affecting fluoroscopy time, number of images, and contrast medium used during diagnostic and interventional coronary procedures.

751,"Lifetime attributable risk of cancer from CT among patients surviving severe traumatic brain injury OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to determine the lifetime attributable risk of cancer from CT among patients surviving severe traumatic brain injury., MATERIALS AND METHODS: A retrospective cross-sectional study was conducted with prospectively collected data on patients 16 years old and older admitted with a Glasgow coma scale score of 8 or less to a single level 1 trauma center from 2007 to 2010. The effective dose of each CT examination the patients underwent was predicted with literature-accepted effective dose values of standard helical CT protocols. The lifetime attributable risk of cancer and related mortality incurred as a result of CT were estimated with the cumulative effective dose incurred from the time of injury to a 1-year follow-up evaluation and with the approach established by the Biologic Effects of Ionizing Radiation VII report., RESULTS: The average patient was a 34-year-old man. The median number of CT examinations received during the first 12 months after injury was 20, and the average cumulative effective dose was 87 +/- 45 mSv. This resulted in increases in the lifetime incidence of all cancer types from 45.5% to 46.3% and in the lifetime incidence of cancer-related mortality from 22.1% to 22.5%., CONCLUSION: Radiation exposure from the use of CT in the evaluation and management of severe traumatic brain injury causes negligible increases in lifetime attributable risk of cancer and cancer-related mortality.

This is correct if pelvis is perpendicular to them (tilt 0degree). But if shoulder girdle is wider than pelvic girdle, pelvis will be tilted towards the feet. And if shoulder girdle is narrower than pelvic girdle, pelvis will be tilted towards the head. Objective(s): To analyse pelvic tilt on surgical table ant its influence on lateral opening of the cup. Method(s): Prospective, blind, observational study. Fifty THA patients (26 female), 1 department, multiple surgeons. Lateral decubitus, horizontal surgical table, conventional anterior (pubic) and posterior (lumbar spine) supports. Preoperative measures: (with custom-made measuring device) width of shoulder and pelvic girdles, pelvic tilt (angle between horizontal surgical table and a line by both antero-superior iliac spines), pelvic tilt towards head or feet. Postero-lateral approach. Theoretical position of cup intended by surgeons: 45degree valgus. Post-surgical x-ray: measure of lateral opening of cup. Result(s): 21/50 (4 males): pelvic girdle 27 mm wider than shoulder girdle (female phenotype), pelvic tilt 1 +/- 7degree towards head, theoretical risk of horizontal cup. Radiographic lateral opening of the cup: 43 +/- 10degree. 3/50 (2 males): pelvic girdle width similar to shoulder girdle, pelvic tilt 7 +/- 2degree towards feet, theoretical risk of vertical cup. Radiographic valgus of cup: 43.8degree. 26/50 (18 males): shoulder girdle 23 mm wider than pelvis (male phenotype), pelvic tilt 1 +/- 5degree towards feet, theoretical risk of vertical cup. Radiographic valgus of cup: 45 +/- 9degree. No result is statistically significant. Conclusion(s): 1) Different widths of shoulder and pelvic girdles could theoretically influence pelvic tilt of patients in lateral decubitus on surgical table. 2) But actually most patients present a minor pelvic tilt. 3) The average radiographic valgus of cups is near 45degree, but the standard deviation is great and an important number is out of recommended range.",Excluded

302,"Feasibility of sentinel node biopsy in head and neck melanoma using a hybrid radioactive and fluorescent tracer Purpose. This study was designed to examine the feasibility of combining lymphoscintigraphy and intraoperative sentinel node identification in patients with head and neck melanoma by using a hybrid protein colloid that is both radioactive and fluorescent. Methods. Eleven patients scheduled for sentinel node biopsy in the head and neck region were studied. Approximately 5 h before surgery, the hybrid nanocolloid labeled with indocyanine green (ICG) and technetium-99m (99mTc) was injected intradermally in four deposits around the scar of the primary melanoma excision. Subsequent lymphoscintigraphy and single photon emission computed tomography with computed tomography (SPECT/CT) were performed to identify the sentinel nodes preoperatively. In the operating room, patent blue dye was injected in 7 of the 11 patients. Intraoperatively, sentinel nodes were acoustically localized with a gamma ray detection probe and visualized by using patent blue dye and/or fluorescencebased tracing with a dedicated near-infrared light camera. A portable gamma camera was used before and after sentinel node excision to confirm excision of all sentinel nodes. Results. A total of 27 sentinel nodes were preoperatively identified on the lymphoscintigraphy and SPECT/CT images. All sentinel nodes could be localized intraoperatively. In the seven patients in whom blue dye was used, 43% of the sentinel nodes stained blue, whereas all were fluorescent. The portable gamma camera identified additional sentinel nodes in two patients. Ex vivo, all radioactive lymph nodes were fluorescent and vice versa, indicating the stability of the hybrid tracer. Conclusions. ICG-99mTc- nanocolloid allows for preoperative sentinel node visualization and concomitant intraoperative radio- and fluorescence guidance to the same sentinel nodes in head and neck melanoma patients. © 2012 Society of Surgical Oncology.",Excluded
685,"Postoperative electron-beam irradiation therapy for keloids and hypertrophic scars: Retrospective study of 147 cases followed for more than 18 months Between 1988 and 2000, 378 cases of keloids were treated in the authors' department, and 147 keloids in 129 patients were selected for this study. Keloids that occurred at a different site in the same patient and keloids that recurred later at the same site were deemed to be different keloids. Those keloids were surgically removed, and the patients were treated postoperatively with 15-Gy electron-beam irradiation and followed for more than 18 months. The therapeutic outcomes were evaluated. Statistical analysis was performed using Fisher's exact probability test or chi-square test. Recurrence occurred in two sites on 14 earlobes (14.3 percent), in two sites on 12 necks (16.7 percent), in 22 sites on 51 anterior chest walls (43.1 percent), in 13 sites in 33 scapular regions (39.4 percent), in four sites on 15 upper limbs (26.7 percent), in four sites in 11 suprapubic regions (36.4 percent), and in one site on 11 lower limbs (9.1 percent). The overall recurrence rate was 32.7 percent. Analysis of the therapeutic outcomes showed that the recurrence rates in the sites with high stretch tension, such as the chest wall, and the scapular and suprapubic regions were statistically higher than in sites without high tension, such as the neck, earlobes, and lower limbs (41.1 percent versus 13.5 percent, p = 0.0017). The results suggested that keloid sites with a high risk of recurrence should be treated with escalated radiation doses and posttreatment self-management.",Excluded
175,"Failures (cause and time) of radiotherapy in oral cancer The results of retrospective clinical evaluation concerning 434 cases of oral carcinomas treated with radiotherapy from January 1959 to December 1967 are presented. The analysis of the results obtained shows that radiotherapy alone may offer a reasonable possiblity of success in limited lesions (68.3% 5-year survival of Stage I patients). In more advanced local cases, and especially those with regional adenopathies, radiotherapy alone cannot consistently control the disease for a long period of time; 5-year survival from the onset of treatment was respectively 36.5% and 24.5% for Stage II and III cases. Moreover, if controlateral of bilateral metastatic adenopathies or fixed lymph nodes are present, the prognosis becomes dramatic (2.6% 5-year survival of Stage IV patients). Among the irradiation techniques currently available, curietherapy (intersitial applications or surface molds) presumably offers the best possibility of success, since the observed failures, both overall and stage by stage, are inferior. Radiotherapy alone may generally be of proven efficacy if the local or locoregional extension is limited. In more advanced cases a combined surgery-chemotherapy treatment method is recommended. The criteria for a combined therapeutic approach for these tumors are also discussed.",Excluded
1005,"Primary tumor site as a predictor of treatment outcome for definitive radiotherapy of advanced-stage oral cavity cancers Purpose: To evaluate the outcome of definitive radiotherapy (RT) for oral cavity cancers and to assess prognostic factors. Methods and Materials: Definitive RT was performed on 115 patients with oral cavity cancers at Stages III, IVA, and IVB, with a distribution of 6%, 47%, and 47%, respectively. The median dose of RT was 72Gy (range, 62-76Gy). Cisplatin-based chemotherapy was administered to 95% of the patients. Eleven patients underwent salvage surgery after RT failure. Result(s): Eight-eight (76.5%) patients responded partially and 23 (20%) completely; of the patients who responded, 18% and 57%, respectively, experienced a durable effect of treatment. The 3-year overall survival, disease-specific survival, and progression-free survival were 22%, 27%, and 25%, respectively. The 3-year PFS rates based on the primary tumor sites were as follows: Group I (buccal, mouth floor, and gum) 51%, Group II (retromolar and hard palate) 18%, and Group III (tongue and lip) 6% (p < 0.0001). The 3-year progression-free survival was 41% for N0 patients and 19% for patients with N+ disease (p = 0.012). The T stage and RT technique did not affect survival. The patients who underwent salvage surgery demonstrated better 3-year overall survival and disease-specific survival (53% vs. 19%, p = 0.015 and 53% vs. 24%, p = 0.029, respectively). Subsite group, N+, and salvage surgery were the only significant prognostic factors for survival after multivariate analysis. Conclusion(s): The primary tumor site and neck stage are prognostic predictors in advanced-stage oral cancer patients who received radical RT.

410,"Gastric emptying measurement of liquid nutrients using the 13C-octanoate breath test in critically ill patients: A comparison with scintigraphy Purpose: Scintigraphy is considered the most accurate technique for the measurement of gastric emptying (GE) but, for patients in the intensive care unit, it is technically demanding, involves radiation and can interfere with care. The 13C-octanoate breath test (13C-OBT) is a simple, non-invasive technique that does not involve radiation exposure. Aim(s): To evaluate the performance of the 13C-OBT in the assessment of GE in critically ill patients. Method(s): The GE was assessed in 33 mechanically ventilated patients (23 M; 54.3 +/- 3.0 yrs; APACHE II: 22.0 +/- 1.1). Following test meal administration (100 ml Ensure), concurrent scintigraphic measurement and breath samples (13C-OBT) were collected over 4 h. Scintigraphic meal retention was determined and the gastric emptying coefficient (GEC) and half emptying time [t50(BT)] were calculated for the 13C-OBT. Delayed GE was defined as meal retention >13 % at 180 min. Result(s): Delayed GE was identified in 27/33 patients. Meal retention correlated modestly with t50(BT) (r = 0.55-0.66; P < 0.001) and well with GEC (r = -0.63 to -0.74; P < 0.0001). The strength of agreement between the two techniques was highest between GEC and retention at 120 min. The best cut-off GEC for defining delayed GE was 3.25 (AUC = 0.75; 95 % CI = 0.52-0.99; P = 0.05), with 89 % sensitivity and 67 % specificity to detect delayed GE. The GE was delayed in all (23/23) patients with feed intolerance (GRV > 250 ml) on scintigraphy and 91 % (21/23) patients on 13C-OBT. Conclusion(s): In critical illness, there was a correlation between 13C-OBT and gastric scintigraphy, with GEC performing as a better and more sensitive marker of detecting delayed GE than t50. However the relatively wide 95 % confidence intervals suggest that 13C-OBT is more suitable as a technique to assess GE in a group setting for research studies rather than for individual patients in clinical practice. © 2013 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg and ESICM.",Excluded
204,"Treatment efficiency of combining photodynamic therapy and ionizing radiation for Bowen's disease BACKGROUND: Topical 5-aminolevulinic acid photodynamic therapy (ALA-PDT) is widely used for treating Bowen's disease (BD), but recurrence and tumour cell persistence after ALA-PDT is sometimes problematic. Radiation therapy (RT) is also effective for BD, but is limited by its side-effects, such as refractory ulcers., OBJECTIVE: The objective of the study was to observe a synergic effect of combination therapy with ALA-PDT and RT for BD cases that did not respond effectively to prior ALA-PDT., METHODS: Subjects were BD patients whose lesion did not show complete remission or showed recurrence after prior ALA-PDT. A total of four cases involving four lesions were studied (three male and one female, mean age 69.5). ALA ointment (20%) was applied to the lesions. After 4 to 6h, subjects received combination therapy consisting of excimer-pumped dye laser radiation at 630nm (50J/cm(2) ) followed by electron-beam radiation (3Gy). The combination therapy was repeated every 2 to 3days for a total of four treatments. The lesions were evaluated clinically or histologically after the final combination therapy session., RESULTS: Following combination therapy, all of the lesions disappeared. Recurrence was not detected during the observations periods, which averaged 14.0months in duration., CONCLUSION: Our results indicate that the cure rate of BD could be improved by combination therapy with ALA-PDT and RT. Compared with conventional RT, the synergetic effect of this therapy might reduce the dose of radiation required, thereby also reducing skin side-effects such as refractory ulcers.

586,"Inappropriateness of Proton Pump Inhibitors After Hospital Discharge Is Associated with Thirty-Day Hospital Readmission Background and Aims: Concerns have been raised about the adverse effects of proton pump inhibitors (PPIs). Rather than PPIs themselves causing harm, we hypothesized that PPIs prescribed without appropriate indications would be associated with adverse outcomes compared to appropriately indicated PPIs. Method(s): Adult patients initiated on a new PPI during a hospitalization at our institution from 2014 to 2018 were analyzed. The primary outcome was all-cause 30-day readmission rate. The primary exposure was long-term appropriateness of PPI determined by the presence of prespecified diagnostic codes and discharge medications. Logistic regression modeling was used to estimate the odds of 30-day readmission in patients discharged on inappropriate compared to appropriate new PPIs. Result(s): Of 84,236 patients admitted to our institution, 7745 (9.2%) were discharged on a new PPI, of which 5136 (66.3%) lacked an appropriately documented indication. Inappropriate PPIs were associated with 30-day hospital readmission after adjusting for other factors (adjusted odds ratio 1.30, 95% confidence interval 1.10-1.53). The excess risk associated with lack of appropriate documentation for PPIs in these patients was 44 readmissions per 1000 hospitalizations (95% confidence interval 21-67). Conclusion(s): Discharge on inappropriate PPIs was associated with 30-day hospital readmission compared to appropriate PPIs. The harm associated with inappropriate PPIs is not likely due to direct effects of PPIs because all patients in the study received PPIs. Rather, patients who receive inappropriate PPIs may have additional patient-specific factors that place them at increased risk for hospital readmission.Copyright © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.",Excluded
1230,"Potential welfare impacts of kill-trapping European moles (Talpa europaea) using scissor traps and Duffus traps: A Post mortem examination study Moles are widely trapped as pests on farms and amenity land in Britain. Spring traps for killing mammals generally require welfare approval in the UK, but mole traps are exempt. Previous research demonstrated wide variation in the mechanical performance of mole traps. In this context, we aimed to produce new data on the welfare impact of kill-trapping moles in the field. We collected 50 moles trapped in southern England (November 2008-August 2009). Captures peaked during the peak in male breeding activity, when captures were almost exclusively male. Post mortem and x-ray (radiation) examinations were conducted to determine injuries and likely cause of death. No moles sustained damaged skulls or upper cervical vertebrae (which could cause unconsciousness immediately). The primary identifiable cause of death for all but one mole was acute haemorrhage; this contrasts with the findings of the only previous such study, in which only one mole showed clear evidence of haemorrhaging. Some moles may have asphyxiated although it was not possible to determine this. Moles most likely became unconscious before death, but times to unconsciousness, and death, can be determined only through killing trials and further investigation is urgently needed. This should be done through the spring traps approval process; this could improve the welfare standards of trapping for many thousands of moles each year. Mole trapping for long-term population control might be better targeted after the peak in male breeding activity, when females are more likely to be caught, but this would threaten the welfare of dependent young underground.Copyright © 2015 Universities Federation for Animal Welfare.",Excluded
891,"Mesenchymal stromal cells implantation in combination with platelet lysate product is safe for reconstruction of human long bone nonunion Objective: Nonunion is defned as a minimum of 9 months since injury without any visible progressive signs of healing for 3 months. Recent literature has shown that the application of mesenchymal stromal cells is safe, in vitro and in vivo, for treating long bone nonunion. The present study was performed to investigate the safety of mesenchymal stromal cell (MSC) implantation in combination with platelet lysate (PL) product for treating human long bone nonunion. Material(s) and Method(s): In this case series clinical trial, orthopedic surgeons visited eighteen patients with long bone nonunion, of whom 7 complied with the eligibility criteria. These patients received mesenchymal stromal cells (20 million cells implanted once into the nonunion site using a?uoroscopic guide) in combination with PL product. For evaluation of the effects of this intervention all the patients were followed up by taking anterior-posterior and lateral X-rays of the affected limb before and 1, 3, 6, and 12 months after the implantation. All side effects (local or systemic, serious or non-serious, related or unrelated) were observed during this time period. Result(s): From a safety perspective the MSC implantation in combination with PL was very well tolerated during the 12 months of the trial. Four patients were healed; based on the control X-ray evidence, bony union had occurred. Conclusion(s): Results from the present study suggest that the implantation of bone marrow-derived MSCs in combination with PL is safe for the treatment of nonunion.

Although the superiority of LSI to conventional passive irradiation (CPI) regarding normal tissue sparing is theoretically evident, the clinical benefit of LSI has not been demonstrated. Here, we compared LSI with CPI using the same treatment planning-computed tomography images used for carbon ion radiotherapy (CIRT). Method(s): Twenty-one parotid tumors were analyzed. The clinical target volume (CTV) 1 and CTV2 encompassed the parotid grand and the tumor, respectively. CTV1 and CTV2 received 36 Gy (RBE: relative biological effectiveness) in nine fractions and 64 Gy (RBE) in 16 fractions, respectively, using either LSI or CPI. CTV coverage was assessed by DX%, which is the dose covering at least X% of the target volume. Skin dose was assessed by SX, which is the skin surface area receiving at least X Gy (RBE). Result(s): For CTV1 and CTV2, there were no significant differences in D2% between LSI and CPI. D50% and D98% were slightly higher for CPI; however, the absolute difference between the two methods was <3%. S10-S60 (in increments of 10) were significantly lower for LSI than for CPI (P < 0.001 for all parameters). LSI was associated with a significant trend toward dose reduction at the skin area irradiated with a higher dose by CPI (P < 0.001). Conclusion(s): LSI achieved better skin sparing than CPI without sacrificing target volume coverage in parotid tumor patients.© Copyright © 2020 Kubo, Kubota, Oike, Kawamura, Sakai, Imamura, Komatsu, Miyasaka, Sato, Musha, Okano, Shirai, Saitoh, Chikamatsu and Ohno.",Excluded

SD series were reconstructed using FBP. RD series were reconstructed with FBP, ASIR, and MBIR (Veo). Three readers-blinded to clinical history and comparison studies-reviewed all series, identifying liver lesions >=4 mm. Non-blinded review by two experienced abdominal radiologists-assessing SD against available clinical and radiologic information-established the reference standard., RESULTS: RD-CECT mean effective dose was 2.01 +/- 1.36 mSv (median, 1.71), a 64.1 +/- 8.8 % reduction. Pooled per-patient performance data were (sensitivity/specificity/PPV/NPV/accuracy) 0.91/0.78/0.60/0.96/0.81 for SD-FBP compared with RD-FBP 0.79/0.75/0.54/0.91/0.76; RD-ASIR 0.84/0.75/0.56/0.93/0.78; and RD-MBIR 0.84/0.68/0.49/0.92/0.72.

351,"Radiation dose response estimation with emphasis on low dose range using restricted cubic splines: application to all solid cancer mortality data, 1950-2003, in atomic bomb survivors Using the all solid cancer mortality data set of the Life Span Study (LSS) cohort from 1950 to 2003 (LSS Report 14) data among atomic bomb survivors, excess relative risk (ERR) statistical analyses were performed using the second degree polynomial and the threshold and restricted cubic spline (RCS) dose response models. For the RCS models with 3 to 7 knots of equally spaced percentiles with margins in the dose range greater than 50 mGy, the dose response was assumed to be linear at less than 70 to 90 mGy. Due to the skewed dose distribution of atomic bomb survivors, the current knot system for the RCS analysis results in a detailed depiction of the dose response as less than approximately 0.5 Gy. The 6 knot RCS models for the all-solid cancer mortality dose response of the whole dose or less than 2 Gy were selected with the AIC model selection criterion and fit significantly better (p < 0.05) than the linear (L) model. The usual RCS includes the L-global model but not the quadratic (Q) nor linear-quadratic (LQ) global models. The authors extended the RCS to include L or LQ global models by putting L or LQ constraints on the cubic spline in the lower and upper tails, and the best RCS model selected with AIC criterion was the usual RCS with L-constraints in both the lower and upper tails. The selected RCS had a linear dose-response model in the lower dose range (i.e., < 0.2-0.3 Gy) and was compatible with the linear no-threshold (LNT) model in this dose range. The proposed method is also useful in describing the dose response of a specific cancer or non-cancer disease incidence/mortality.",Excluded

METHOD(S): Confirmed COVID-19 inpatients undergoing to unenhanced chest CT were scanned with a dual-energy acquisition (DECT, 90/150Sn kV) and a dual-source, high-pitch acquisition with tin-filtered 100 kVp (LDCT). On the DECT with ADMIRE 3 (DECT3) were evaluated the pulmonary findings and their extension (25-point score). Two radiologists in consensus evaluated with 5-point scales the overall image quality, the anatomical structures, and the elementary findings on LDCT reconstructed with filtered backprojection (LDCT0), with ADMIRE 3 (LDCT3) and 5 (LDCT5), and on DECT3. The signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), the body mass index, the exposure times, and the radiation doses were recorded.

In addition, irradiated female recipients that received IL-1-pretreated male donor bone marrow cells displayed an increased presence of male donor cells in their bone marrow, spleen, and thymus for up to 3 months posttransplant. Furthermore, serial transplantation studies revealed that male cells could only be detected in tertiary female recipients who received bone marrow from mice transplanted with IL-1-treated cells. These results indicate that IL-1 pretreatment protects both short-term and long-term repopulating stem cells from an irradiation insult and that these cells are capable of reconstituting the myeloid and lymphoid organs of recipient mice.",Excluded
150,"Estimation of activity of administered 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose by measurement of the dose equivalent rate on the right temporal region of the head Background: Positron emission tomography (PET) with 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) is now a routine procedure for the management of cancer patients. Intravenous administration of FDG is sometimes halted due to troubles. In such cases, estimations of the FDG dosage injected prior to halting administration may be helpful. We have established a method of estimating the activity of FDG to patients on the basis of the dose equivalent rate on the surface of the right temporal region of the head. The correlation of actual administered dosage with independent variables, such as the dose equivalent rate on the right temporal region of the head, age, sex, and body weight, was analyzed using multiple regression analysis to obtain linear, quadratic, and cubic regression equations. Result(s): When entering independent variables, the cubic regression equation could be used to estimate an administered dosage with an accuracy of +/-10 % for 62 % of all patients and +/-20 % for 90 % of all patients. Conclusion(s): We conclude that this method is useful for estimating the administered dosage from the dose equivalent rate on the temporal region of the head.Copyright © 2016, The Author(s).",Excluded
275,"Primary orbital meningioma: a study of six cases at a single institution Primary orbital meningioma is a rare tumor of the anterior visual pathway and constitutes approximately 2% of all orbital tumors and 1-2% of all meningiomas. The differentiation from secondary orbital meningioma of intracranial origin is sometimes difficult on image. As the tumor often leads to visual loss if left untreated and surgical intervention inevitably causes morbidity, the timing and modality of treatment are very important. We carried out the study involving six cases (mean age: 42.7 years, male to female ratio: 1:5) of primary orbital meningioma to further elucidate its behavior. The clinical signs and symptoms, diagnosis, treatment strategies, and follow-up information are recorded for all cases. The most frequent initial symptoms were visual complaints (100%) and proptosis (67%). In five cases, the diagnosis was based on pathologic findings and the tumors were all grade I meningiomas. In one case, however, the diagnosis was based on radiographic and clinical findings, lacking histologic confirmation. Five patients were operated on, four underwent tumor removal, and one received eyeball exenteration. One patient was treated with Novalis radiotherapy. The mean follow-up period was 8.8 years (range from 9 months to 15 years). All patients experienced loss of vision during the course without exception. No recurrent tumor was found in five cases during follow-up. In case 5, whose eyeball was exenterated, developed recurrent meningioma 7 years later. She received radiotherapy but the tumor was out of control. She expired 8 years after eyeball exenteration. The primary orbital meningioma is aggressive in behavior despite its benign histopathologic features. Loss of vision is frequently seen even after treatment. The tumor could be fatal if surgery and radiotherapy fail to control its intracranial extension.",Excluded
541,"73.6 Gy and beyond: Hyperfractionated accelerated radiotherapy for non-small-cell lung cancer Purpose: To assess results with twice-daily high-dose radiotherapy (RT) for non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Patients and Methods: Between 1991 and 1998, 94 patients with unresectable NSCLC were prescribed >= 73.6 Gy via accelerated fractionation. Fifty were on a phase II protocol (P group); 44 were similarly treated off-protocol (NP group). The clinical target volume received 45 Gy at 1.25 Gy bid (6-hour interval). The gross target volume received 1.6 Gy bid to 73.6 to 80 Gy over 4.5 to 5 weeks using a concurrent boost technique. Overall survival (OS) and local progression-free survival (LPFS) were calculated by the Kaplan-Meier method. Median follow-up durations for surviving P and NP patients were 67 and 16 months, respectively. Result(s): Total doses received were >= 72 Gy in 97% of patients. The median OS by stage was 34, 13, and 12 months for stages I/II, IIIa, and IIIb, respectively. LPFS was significantly longer for patients with T1 lesions (median, 43 months) versus T2-4 (median, 7 to 10 months; P = .01). Results were similar in the P and NP groups. Acute grade >= 3 toxicity included esophagus (14 patients; 15%), lung (three patients; 3% [one grade 5]), and skin (four patients; 4%). Grade >= 3 late toxicity in 86 assessable patients included esophagus (three patients; 3%), lung (15 patients; 17% [three grade 5]), skin (five patients; 6%), heart (two patients; 2%), and nerve (one patient; 1%). Conclusion(s): This regimen yielded favorable survival results, particularly for T1 lesions. Acute grade >= 3 toxicity seems greater than for conventional RT, though most patients recovered. Late grade >= 3 pulmonary toxicity occurred in 17%. Because of continued locoregional recurrences, we are currently using doses >= 86 Gy. © 2001 by American Society of Clinical Oncology.",Excluded
1076,"NORMAL TISSUE REACTIONS TO CHRONIC RADIATION EXPOSURE IN MAN This paper presents an overview of radiobiological dependences governing the occurrence of tissue (organ) reactions that determine the outcomes of chronic exposure to low-LET ionizing radiation (IR) in humans. The mechanisms involved in the development of tissue reactions (TRs) to long-term exposures to IR and radioadaptation are considered. The overview describes the reactions of the haematopoietic, immune, nervous, reproductive and endocrine systems, lungs, skin and crystalline lens to chronic radiation exposure, which are of fundamental importance in view of radiation protection. It is shown that the individual's physiological tissue (organ) reserve, and also that induced by radiation exposure at low-dose rates are of great significance in the context of TR development.

869,"Application of interstitial brachytherapy via parapharynx involvement transnasal approach to enhance dose in radiotherapy for nasopharyngeal carcinoma BACKGROUND & OBJECTIVE: Although intracavitary irradiation (ICI) is usually applied to enhance dose in radiotherapy for early stage nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC), its use in parapharyngeal enhancing dose is limited because of dislocation and poor repetition of conventional catheterization. This study was to evaluate the application of a new technique, interstitial brachytherapy via parapharynx involvement transnasal approach, to enhance dose in radiotherapy for NPC. METHOD(S): Twenty-three naive and recurrent NPC patients with tumor residue of more than 1 cm under nasopharyngeal mucosa or restricted tumor residue in the parapharyngeal space received interstitial brachytherapy between Sep. 2005 and Aug. 2006 via parapharynx involvement transnasal approach under the guidance of sinus endoscopy. The 3-dimensional (3D) planning system was used to delineate target volume, optimize dose distribution, and perform interstitial brachytherapy after CT scan. The depths of catheters under mucosa on the moment of inserting and pulling out were measured. The efficacy and complications were assessed. RESULT(S): All catheters were intubated into tumors successfully; the veracity of catheter location was 100%. The submucosa depths of catheters were (9.59+/-2.72) mm when inserted and (9.43+/-2.30) mm when pulled out, without significant difference (t = 0.23,P > 0.05); the shift length was (0.75+/-0.75) mm. The patients were followed up from 3 to 15 months (median, 6 months), and no one dropt out. Three cases of irradiation-associated turbinate adhesion occurred and were cured after lysis; no infection, serious bleeding, palatal perforation, nasopharyngeal necrosis, and other serious complications occurred. All tumors disappeared in 3 months after treatment. No local recurrence and distant metastasis occurred. CONCLUSION(S): The nasopharyngeal and parapharyngeal catheterization with sinus endoscopy guidance is accurate, steady, safe, and feasible. Interstitial brachytherapy is effective for tumor residue in the nasopharynx or parapharyngeal space of NPC patients after radiotherapy without serious complications.",Excluded
152,"Prophylactic cranial irradiation in elderly patients with small cell lung cancer: Findings from a North Central Cancer Treatment Group pooled analysis Objectives: To examine the efficacy of prophylactic cranial irradiation (PCI) in elderly patients with small cell lung cancer (SCLC) (>=. 70. years of age) from a pooled analysis of four prospective trials. Material(s) and Method(s): One hundred fifty-five patients with SCLC (limited stage, LSCLC, and extensive stage, ESCLC) participated in four phase II or III trials. Ninety-one patients received PCI (30. Gy/15 or 25. Gy/10) and 64 patients did not receive PCI. Survival was compared in a landmark analysis that included only patients who had stable disease or better in response to primary therapy. Result(s): Patients who received PCI had better survival than patients who did not receive PCI (median survival 12.0. months vs. 7.6. months, 3-year overall survival 13.2% vs. 3.1%, HR. =. 0.53 [95% CI 0.36-0.78], p=. 0.001). On multivariate analysis of the entire cohort, the only factor that remained significant for survival was stage (ESCLC vs. LSCLC, p=. 0.0072). In contrast, the multivariate analysis of patients who had ESCLC revealed that PCI was the sole factor associated with a survival advantage (HR. =. 0.47 [95% CI 0.24-0.93], p=. 0.03). Grade 3 or higher adverse events (AEs) were significantly greater in patients who received PCI (71.4% vs. 47.5%, p=. 0.0031), with non-neuro and non-heme being the specific AE categories most strongly correlated with PCI delivery. Conclusion(s): PCI was associated with a significant improvement in survival for our entire elderly SCLC patient cohort on univariate analysis. Multivariate analysis suggested that the survival advantage remained significant in patients with ESCLC. PCI was also associated with a modest increase in grade 3 or higher AEs.Copyright © 2014 Elsevier Inc.",Excluded
770,"Minimal-invasive bracing of the lumbar spine using an interspinous spacer Introduction: The Superion interspinous spacer (VertiFlex, Inc. San Clemente, CA. USA) is a minimal-invasive spacer for limitation of extension and for indirect expansion of the Neuro Foramen in patients with intermittend neurogenic claudication in moderate spinal canal stenosis. The implant is placed over a midline access with protection of the supraspinous ligament. We introduce indications, basic priniples of biomechanics and clinical results. Material(s) and Method(s): The Superion Spacer has been implanted in 12 male and 2 female patients with an average age of 74 years (69-79 years) from 3/2008 to 4/2009. Operated levels were L3/4 in 6 cases and L4/5 in 7 cases. In one patient we implanted the spacer in 2 levels, L3/4 and L4/5. The clinical outcome has been determined using the ZCQ (Zurich Claudication Questionaire), the Oswestry Disability Index (ODI) and the VAS (Visual Analogue Scale) preoperatively as well as 3, 6 and 12 Months postoperatively. Result(s): In the one year follow up we examined and documented the maintained distraction or loss of correction using plain x-rays. Beside one fracture of the Spinous Process leading to to the abort of the operation, no further complications could be identified. The average OR-time was 41 minutes (30-58 Min.). The clinical outcome scores in the 1-year follow up were improved compared to the preoperative basic value: ZCQ Symptoms improved from 3,81 to 1,52, ZCQ physical function improved from 2,68 to 1,23 and the ZCQ patient satisfaction to1,2. An improvement of the ODI from 45,3 to 14,1 and of the VAS back pain from 2,5 to 0,7 could be observed while the VAS leg pain improved from 3,9 to 0,5 in the left leg ; from 3,4 to 1,9 in the right leg. Conclusion(s): The Superion Interspinous Spacer is an implant for treatment of the moderate spinal Canal stenosis as an alternative to conservative treatment. The minimal-invasive technique, the conservation of the supraspinous ligament and the improvement of the outcome parameters legitimate the use of the spacer in selected patients with symptoms of intermittend spinal claudication.

424,"Clinical and radiological results of osteosynthesis for vancouver type B and type C periprosthetic femoral fractures with locking plates and cables Objective: The aim of the study is to document the outcome of osteosynthesis with locking plate and cable for periprosthetic femoral fracture PFF. Patient(s): Between 2007 and 2014, nine patients were identified: five with Vancouver type B1 fracture, one with type B2, and three with type C. A single lateral locking plate and cables were used for osteosynthesis in all patients. Cerclage also was used to gain tight fixation depending on the fracture type. The rate and the time of fracture union, walking ability at final follow-up, the position of the fracture reduction at the time of surgery, and complications of surgery were investigated. Result(s): Patients achieved fracture union on average by 6.5 months after fixation. At mean follow-up of 14 months, 7 of 9 patients had recovered their pre-injury walking ability. Two patients still had a fracture gap of 4mm after fixation, one had stem subsidence of 5mm one month after fixation, and another had delayed-union. There were no serious complications such as infection or hardware failure. Conclusion(s): The outcome of osteosynthesis with locking plates and cables for PFFs was successful. The degree of reduction and strong fixation are essential factors for the treatment of periprosthetic femoral fractures.Copyright © 2016, Chiba Medical Society. All rights reserved.",Excluded
383,"Outcomes of intensity-modulated radiotherapy versus conventional radiotherapy for hypopharyngeal cancer Background The purpose of this study was to discuss if the adoption of intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) for hypopharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) has improved the outcome. Methods We compared 3-dimensional (3D) radiotherapy (RT) and IMRT in all patients with hypopharyngeal SCC treated with curative intent RT or chemoradiation therapy (CRT) from January 1, 2000, to February 28, 2010. Locoregional control, overall survival (OS), distant relapse rate, larynx preservation rate, and enteral feeding tube duration were analyzed. Results Of 181 consecutive patients, 90 received 3D-RT and 91 received IMRT. At 3 years, the IMRT group had higher locoregional control compared with the 3D-RT group (75% vs 58%; p =.003), but similar OS (50% vs 52%; p =.99), distant relapse rate (23% vs 20%; p =.79), and larynx-preservation rate (90% vs 86%; p =.16). The 2-year enteral feeding tube dependency rate was similar in both groups (19% vs 18%; p =.12).

1102,"Biopsy of pleural thickenings with pocket size ultrasound device Introduction:Pleural pathology diagnosis is based on the collection of cytological and histological samples. The use of image techniques is becoming more popular to increase accuracy and safety. TAC-guided thoracic biopsy is the most commonly used method but thoracic ultrasound offers some advantages like: absence of ionizing radiations and bedside exploration. Our aim was to analyze effectiveness and safety of the ultrasound-guided pleural biopsies using a pocket size ultrasound device (PSUD). Method(s): A prospective, one-year study from January 2016 to January 2017 was carried out. We included all patients with pleural thickening greater than 3 mm. Pleural biopsy was performed with a 14G gauge automatic needle (Acecut. TSK). Biopsy was completely echo-guided. Result(s):The samples were tagged as adequate sample (AS) or non-adequate sample (NAS) depending on the presence of mesothelium evidenced by the pathologist. Adequate samples (AS) were also tagged as diagnostic samples (DAS) or non-diagnostic samples (NDAS). We enrolled 32 patients. 68.8% were males, mean age of 53 (ED: 31). Biopsy was performed without need of hospitalization in 50 % of the cases. We obtained 26 AS (84.4%). 96.4% of them were diagnostic (DAS). Only one case showed further evidence of pleural involvement in a negative biopsy (mediastinal pleura). The only complication in all the biopsies performed was a pneumothorax without clinical repercussion in a pleural nodule biopsy without pleural effusion. The patient was treated with a conservative approach. Conclusion(s):PSUD is a useful tool to increases effectiveness and safety of the histologic diagnosis of pleural thickening.",Excluded
764,"Radiotherapy as a local treatment option for heterotopic ossifications in patients with spinal cord injury Objective: Heterotopic ossifications (HO) occur in about 20% of patients with spinal cord injury and may seriously compromise the rehabilitation process. The aim of the present study was to ascertain whether radiotherapy (RT) administered early in the course of the disease prevents the manifestation of HO and whether in patients, whose HO have been resected, recurrence can be avoided. Method(s): Thirty-six patients (46 joints) were irradiated; 33 patients were evaluable. Mean follow up was 23.6 months. In 27 patients RT was performed as primary treatment in the inflammatory phase of soft tissue swelling that precedes manifest HO. Eleven patients were treated after resection of manifest HO, while two had primary and postoperative RT in different joints. The dose was 10 Gy in fractions of 2-2.5 Gy in 25 patients. Four patients were treated with total doses between 7.5 and 20 Gy. Seven patients received single dose irradiation with 8 Gy. RT was performed with 8 MV photons after simulation on the basis of CT scans. Result(s): The mean duration of follow up was 23.6 months. Thirty of the 36 irradiated patients showed no progression of HO. In three patients reossifications after therapy caused a moderate decrease in joint mobility. No relevant adverse effects were observed. Conclusion(s): These results suggest that RT is a safe and effective local treatment option for spinal cord injury patients with HO.",Excluded

71,"Time dependent failure rate and marginal bone loss of implant supported prostheses: a 15-year follow-up study This study deals with 4971 implants (Branemark system) installed in 1315 patients, either fully or partially edentulous, and followed from implant installation up to the last control. A predominance of female patients (61%) and a nearly equal number of upper and lower jaws characterised the study group. Patients were scheduled each 6-12 months for recall. The observation time varied from 0.5 to 15 years (mean 5.1). The whole cohort was split up into compromised (n = 59) and non-compromised (n = 1256) patients. The former are defined as grafted (autologous bone) and patients irradiated in the head and neck area. In the compromised patients 24 out of 59 patients (40.6%) showed failures, in whom 59 out of 310 (19%) implants failed. In the non-compromised patients, implant failures were observed in 11.6% of the patients, which corresponds to 5.9% of the installed implants, excluding iatrogenic failures. Failures were further divided chronologically into early (up to 1 year after abutment connection) and late failures. There were early implant failures in 12.5% of the compromised patients and in 3.4% of the others. Late implant failures occurred in 7.4 and 2% of the two patients groups, respectively. While gender did not affect the failure rate, implant lengths, corresponding to the available bone height did, since a 21.5% failure rate for the 7-mm implants contrasts with 4.1 and 3.8% for 13- and 15-mm implants, respectively. Early as well as annual late failures are more frequently found in the maxilla. Implant fractures only occurred in the fixed (both partial and full) prosthesis group but never surpassed the 0.2% annual level. Marginal bone loss, exceeding the third screw thread occurred in 1.8% of the implants at the last control. It appears that this type of implant configuration offers a high long-term predictability. Failures occur before, at or during the first year after abutment connection and in very short implants. Marginal bone as a whole is very stable over the years.",Excluded

Result(s): Using the last available GH, there was a statistically significant increase in mortality comparing groups as low as GH <= 1 mug/L vs >1 mug/L (relative risks [RR] 1.8, P = .03). This was not the case when using the ""time-dependent method,"" where only comparisons of GH values of GH <=5 mug/L vs >5 mug/L were suggestive of being associated with an increased risk of mortality (RR = 1.5, P = .08).

Irrespective of using the last available or time-dependent method, when IGF-I was divided into levels according to quartile or arbitrary cutoffs, there was no significant increase in mortality with higher levels. Conclusion(s): This study emphasizes the potential bias of using the latest available GH/IGF-I levels to predict mortality.

Method(s):Forty-six patients were recruited and treated on the basis that MRI scanning had shown poor-risk tumours with threatening (1 mm) or involvement of the mesorectal fascia. Conformal RT was given using 3 or 4 fields at daily fractions of 1.8 Gy on 5 days per week to a total dose of 45 Gy. Concurrently oral capecitabine was given twice daily throughout radiotherapy continuously from days 1 to 35 and intravenous irinotecan was given once per week during weeks 1 to 4 of RT. Dose levels were gradually escalated as follows. Dose level 1: capecitabine 650 mg m 2 b.i.d. and irinotecan 50 mg m 2; Dose level 2: capecitabine 650 mg m 2 b.i.d. and irinotecan 60 mg m 2; Dose level 3: capecitabine 825 mg m 2 b.i.d. and irinotecan 60 mg m 2; Dose level 4: capecitabine 825 mg m 2 b.i.d. and irinotecan 70 mg m 2. Result(s):Diarrhoea (grade 3, no grade 4) was the main serious acute toxicity with lesser degrees of fatigue, neutropenia, anorexia and palmar-plantar erythrodysesthesia. The recommended dose for future study was dose level 2 at which 3 of 14 patients (21%) developed grade 3 diarrhoea. Postoperative complications included seven pelvic or wound infections and two anastomotic and two perineal wound dehiscences. There were no deaths in the first 30 days postoperatively.

59,"Preferential damage to IgM production by ultraviolet B in the cells of patients with Bloom's syndrome In most patients with Bloom's syndrome (BS), selective IgM deficiency is commonly found. We examined proliferative responses by incorporation of [3H]-thymidine and the production of immunoglobulin after ultraviolet B (UVB) irradiation in the cells of two patients with BS. With regard to the proliferative responses in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) cultured with pokeweed mitogen (PWM), the patients' PBMC were more sensitive to UVB irradiation than controls. Although the effect of UVB irradiation in lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCL) after 0 days of culture showed no difference between one patient and controls, the patient's LCL were more sensitive to UVB than the controls after 3 and 7 days of culture. These results suggest that the proliferative responses of the patient's LCL recovered later than those of controls. IgM production was the most sensitive to UVB in the patients' PBMC and LCL. IgG and IgA production in the patients' PBMC and LCL showed the same sensitivity as controls. From our results, it is suspected that the preferential damage to IgM production by UVB is connected with the selective IgM deficiency of BS.",Excluded

Serum 25(OH)D levels were modeled for each country, and their association with brain cancer also was determined., RESULTS: The incidence rates of brain cancer were higher at higher latitudes (R(2) for males = 0.45, p <= 0.0001; R(2) for females = 0.35, p < 0.0001). After adjustment for potential confounders, UVB irradiance (p <= 0.0001) and modeled serum 25(OH)D were inversely associated with incidence rates., CONCLUSIONS: Countries with low solar UVB irradiance and estimated mean serum 25(OH)D levels generally had higher age-standardized incidence rates of brain cancer.

A total of 95 consecutive olecranon fractures were operatively treated in our level I trauma institution between 1 March 1992 and 1 March 2000. Medical records and X-rays of all patients were evaluated. Three patients died, 23 were lost to follow-up. Fifty-eight of 69 available patients (84.0%) were reviewed clinically and/or radiologically after a mean time of 36 months. Fracture type, fracture classification, associated lesions, technical correctness of osteosynthesis, age and comorbidity were analysed. Radiological end result (intraarticular steps, gaps, arthrosis), subjective complaints, mobility of the elbow joint and muscle strength were evaluated. Patients with an unstable elbow (Mayo classification Type III and Schatzker-Schmeling classification Type D) had a higher loss of elbow function than others. There was a correlation between fracture morphology (fractures Type C and Type D in the Schatzker-Schmeling classification) and arthrosis. There also was a correlation between suboptimal osteosynthesis and arthrosis. There was no correlation between suboptimal osteosynthesis, implant loosening and secondary procedures. Patients more often expressed subjective complaints and loss of function in activities of daily life before than after metal removal. Primary elbow instability and fracture morphology are prognostic factors for elbow function and development of arthrosis after operative treatment of olecranon fractures. We, therefore, recommend the classification systems of the Mayo-clinic or of Schatzker-Schmeling. As many patients have complaints related to the implants, we recommend metal removal after fracture healing. © 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",Excluded

Thirty-eight patients were given preoperative irradiation at a daily single focal dose of 4 Gy and a summary dose of 20 Gy, followed by nephrectomy in 24-48 h. Radiation reactions in preoperative irradiation were less marked than in postoperative irradiation. The 3-year survival rate in preoperative irradiation and nephrectomy was 72.5%, the 5-year survival rate was 53.2%. A fractionation type did not influence the survival rates.",Excluded
259,"Dose reduction using digital fluoroscopy versus digital subtraction angiography in endovascular aneurysm repair: A prospective randomized trial OBJECTIVE: Endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR) can result in high radiation dose to patients and operators. This prospective randomized study aimed to assess whether patient radiation dose sustained during EVAR could be decreased by predominantly using digital fluoroscopy (DF) vs the standard technique using digital subtraction angiography (DSA)., METHODS: Between February 2011 and June 2017, patients with EVAR of infrarenal abdominal aortic aneurysms were prospectively enrolled and randomly assigned to a standard treatment DSA cohort or a DF cohort in which two or fewer DSA acquisitions were allowed for confirmatory imaging. Primary end points included dose-area product (DAP) and cumulative air kerma. Secondary end points included technical success and conversion to DSA standard treatment (if DF was inadequate for visualization)., RESULTS: For all 43 patients enrolled (26 in the DF cohort, 17 in the DSA cohort), technical success was 100%. Of the 26 DF patients, 5 (19%) required conversion to the DSA cohort. In an intention-to-treat analysis, mean DAP was significantly lower in the DF cohort than in the DSA cohort (132 vs 174 Gy.cm2; P = .04). When patients were separated by number of DSA acquisitions (two or fewer vs three or more), mean DAP decreased 41% (109 vs 185 Gy.cm2; P = .005) and cumulative air kerma decreased 40% (578 vs 964 mGy; P = .004)., CONCLUSIONS: In most patients (81%), DF or limited DSA was adequate for visualization during EVAR. In both intention-to-treat DF and limited-DSA cohorts, mean DAP was significantly decreased. If image quality allows, a DF-only or limited-DSA approach to EVAR decreases radiation dose.

754,"Massive introgression drives species radiation at the range limit of Anopheles gambiae Impacts of introgressive hybridisation may range from genomic erosion and species collapse to rapid adaptation and speciation but opportunities to study these dynamics are rare. We investigated the extent, causes and consequences of a hybrid zone between Anopheles coluzzii and Anopheles gambiae in Guinea-Bissau, where high hybridisation rates appear to be stable at least since the 1990s. Anopheles gambiae was genetically partitioned into inland and coastal subpopulations, separated by a central region dominated by A. coluzzii. Surprisingly, whole genome sequencing revealed that the coastal region harbours a hybrid form characterised by an A. gambiae-like sex chromosome and massive introgression of A. coluzzii autosomal alleles. Local selection on chromosomal inversions may play a role in this process, suggesting potential for spatiotemporal stability of the coastal hybrid form and providing resilience against introgression of medically-important loci and traits, found to be more prevalent in inland A. gambiae.",Excluded
852,"Stricture of the proximal esophagus in head and neck carcinoma patients after radiotherapy BACKGROUND. It is well recognized that many patients with head and neck carcinoma have problems with food intake and malnutrition. The objective of the current study was to determine the clinical pattern of patients with nonneoplastic stricture of the upper esophagus after radiotherapy for head and neck carcinoma. METHODS. A retrospective chart study of 22 patients with stricture of the proximal esophagus diagnosed between 1993 and 1999 at Karolinska Hospital was performed. The dose volume histograms of the first 2 cm and 5 cm, respectively, of the proximal esophagus were calculated. RESULTS. Five of the patients (23%) had total obliteration. The first 2 cm of the esophagus received at least 60 grays (Gy) in > 80% of the volume. Radiation injury was not reported to occur at doses < 60 Gy. There was a correlation found between dysphagia during radiotherapy and the development of proximal esophageal stricture. Stricture was diagnosed 1-60 months (median, 6 months) after radiotherapy. In 18 patients, the stricture was treated with single or repeated endoscopic dilation. These treatments allowed a nearly normal diet in 78% of the patients. CONCLUSIONS. Stricture of the upper esophagus is one deglutition disorder that is reported to occur after radiotherapy for head and neck carcinoma. In the current study, the authors emphasize the importance of knowing the tolerance of the normal esophagus to irradiation as well as early diagnosis of stricture of the proximal esophagus because this condition may lead to physical and emotional distress. © 2003 American Cancer Society.",Excluded
490,"Neoadjuvant chemotherapy in 16 patients with locally advanced papillary thyroid carcinoma-a phase 1 study Background and Objectives: It is believed that chemotherapy (ChT) is ineffective in papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC). The aim of our retrospective chart review was to find out if neodjuvant ChT before thyroid surgery had any effect on the size of primary tumor in patients with PTC. Method(s): In the period 1976-2006, 1,207 patients were treated for PTC at our Institute. The study included 16 patients (13 women, 3 men; mean age 63.5 years) with PTC, who were treated with neoadjuvant ChT from 1988-2005. Poorly differentiated PTC, classical PTC, follicular variant of PTC and Hurthle cell variant of PTC was diagnosed in five cases, five, three and three cases, respectively. A mean tumor diameter was 9.9 cm (range 5-22 cm). Seven patients had pT4 tumor. Regional metastases were detected in ten patients and distant metastases in seven patients. ChT consisted of Vinblastine in eleven cases, Vinblastine with Adriamyin in two cases and other schedules in three cases. Three patients were treated also with preoperative external irradiation. Result(s): Altogether, 40 cycles of ChT were given. After ChT tumor size decreased in all 16 patients: for more than 50% in seven (= 44%) patients and for less than 50% in nine patients. R0, R1 and R2 resection was performed in two, ten and four cases, respectively. Median survival of our patients was 92 (range 11-240) months. Six patients are still alive (median survival 157 months) and two of them have no evidence of disease. Two patients died of causes not related to carcinoma, while eight patients died of PTC (five of distant metastases, one of locoregional disease, two of distant metastases and locoregional disease). Conclusion(s): Neoadjuvant ChT before thyroid surgery may be effective in patients with locally advanced PTC. After neoadjuvant ChT, in 44% of our patients the tumor size decreased for more than 50%.",Excluded
122,"Synthesis of D-mannose capped silicon nanoparticles and their interactions with MCF-7 human breast cancerous cells Silicon nanoparticles (SiNPs) hold prominent interest in various aspects of biomedical applications. For this purpose, surface functionalization of the NPs is essential to stabilize them, target them to specific disease area, and allow them to selectively bind to the cells or the bio-molecules present on the surface of the cells. However, no such functionalization has been explored with Si nanoparticles. Carbohydrates play a critical role in cell recognition. Here, we report the first synthesis of silicon nanoparticles functionalized with carbohydrates. In this study, stable and brightly luminescent d-Mannose (Man) capped SiNPs have been synthesized from amine terminated SiNPs and d-mannopyranoside acid. The surface functionalization is confirmed by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (NMR), and energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) studies. The mean diameter of the crystal core is 5.5 nm, as measured by transmission electron microscopy (TEM), while the hydrodynamic diameter obtained by dynamic light scattering (DLS) is 16 nm. The quantum yield (QY) of photoluminescence emission is found to be 11.5%, and the nanoparticles exhibit an exceptional stability over two weeks. The Man-capped SiNPs may prove to be valuable tools for further investigating glycobiological, biomedical, and material science fields. Experiments are carried out using Concanavalin A (ConA) as a target protein in order to prove the hypothesis. When Man functionalized SiNPs are treated with ConA, cross-linked aggregates are formed, as shown in TEM images as well as monitored by photoluminescence spectroscopy (PL). Man functionalized SiNPs can target cancerous cells. Visualization imaging of SiNPs in MCF-7 human breast cancer cells shows the fluorescence is distributed throughout the cytoplasm of these cells.",Excluded
330,"Experienced Mindfulness Meditators Exhibit Higher Parietal-Occipital EEG Gamma Activity during NREM Sleep Over the past several years meditation practice has gained increasing attention as a non-pharmacological intervention to provide health related benefits, from promoting general wellness to alleviating the symptoms of a variety of medical conditions. However, the effects of meditation training on brain activity still need to be fully characterized. Sleep provides a unique approach to explore the meditation-related plastic changes in brain function. In this study we performed sleep high-density electroencephalographic (hdEEG) recordings in long-term meditators (LTM) of Buddhist meditation practices (approximately 8700 mean hours of life practice) and meditation naive individuals. We found that LTM had increased parietal-occipital EEG gamma power during NREM sleep. This increase was specific for the gamma range (25-40 Hz), was not related to the level of spontaneous arousal during NREM and was positively correlated with the length of lifetime daily meditation practice. Altogether, these findings indicate that meditation practice produces measurable changes in spontaneous brain activity, and suggest that EEG gamma activity during sleep represents a sensitive measure of the long-lasting, plastic effects of meditative training on brain function. © 2013 Ferrarelli et al.",Excluded
353,"Efficacy of topical PUVA soaks for palmoplantar dermatoses: an audit BACKGROUND: With a lack of evidence base for individual topical PUVA protocols, treatment is presently based on the consensus of current practice. This audit was designed to investigate the effectiveness of topical PUVA for palmoplantar dermatoses., METHODS: Phototherapy notes were reviewed on all patients who received hand and/or foot PUVA 2002-2007 in the Northern Health and Social Care Trust (NHSCT), Northern Ireland., RESULTS: Thirty patients met the inclusion criteria for the study. The mean number of treatments, maximum single UVA dose, and cumulative dose, were 18.4, 4.2 J/cm2, and 48.3 J/cm2, respectively. A positive response to treatment occurred in 51.3% of patients, which fell short of the 70% standard set. In a multivariate logistic regression analysis, number of treatments (P=0.04) and maximum single UVA dose (P=0.03) were the only variables associated with positive treatment outcome. The response was not influenced significantly by skin type, concurrent topical treatments, or cumulative UVA dose. Limitations to the study: Small patient numbers may have prevented the statistical significance of individual variables., CONCLUSIONS: UV dose increments should be clearly defined to avoid excess caution at the expense of an adequate patient response, and a minimum of 20 treatments administered to all patients, if tolerated.",Excluded

307,"Skin aging induced by ultraviolet exposure and tobacco smoking: evidence from epidemiological and molecular studies BACKGROUND: Tobacco smoking, similar to ultraviolet (UV) A radiation exposure, has previously been identified as an important factor contributing to premature aging of human skin., OBJECTIVE AND DESIGN: To investigate the relationship between these two environmental factors, we have conducted a cross-sectional study of 83 subjects (48 males, 35 females, age range 23-95), in which sun exposure, pack-years of smoking history and potential confounding variables were assessed by questionnaire. Facial wrinkles were quantified using the Daniell score. In order to study the molecular mechanism by which smoking caused wrinkle formation, in vitro studies were conducted to assess the alteration of matrix metalloproteinase-1 (MMP-1) mRNA expression in human fibroblasts stimulated with tobacco smoke extract or/and UVA., RESULTS: Logistic statistic analysis of the data revealed that age [odds ratio (OR)=7.5, 95% confidence interval (CI)=1.87-30.161, pack-years (OR=5.8, 95% CI=1.72-19.87), and sun exposure (OR=2.65, 95% CI=1.0-7.0) independently contributed to facial wrinkle formation. When excessive sun exposure (>2 h/day) and heavy smoking (35 pack-years) occurred together, the risk for developing wrinkles was 11.4 times higher than that of non-smokers and those with less sun exposure (<2 h/day) at the same age. The in vitro studies revealed that MMP-1 expression was significantly increased in fibroblasts after the stimulation with either tobacco smoke extract or UVA. Maximum induction was observed when cells were treated with tobacco smoke extract plus UVA, indicating that the two factors act in an additive manner. MMP-1 induction was significantly higher in the low glutathione (GSH) content fibroblast compared to that in the high GSH fibroblast, indicating that the differences in glutathione content define the susceptibility of fibroblasts towards UV- or tobacco smoking-induced MMP-1 expression., CONCLUSION: Tobacco smoke and UVA cause wrinkle formation independently of each other. We propose that both factors cause aging of human skin through additive induction of MMP-1 expression.",Excluded
782,"Ultraviolet radiation enhances both the nodular and ulcerative forms of Mycobacterium ulcerans infection in a Crl:IAF (HA)-hrBR hairles guinea pig model of Buruli ulcer disease Background: Ultraviolet radiation (UV) pre-exposure enhances intracellular mycobacterial infections, however, its effect upon the pathogenesis of the extracellular Mycobacterium ulcerans parasite had not been previously examined. The hypothesis tested was that UV pre-exposure enhances both the nodular and ulcerative forms of M. ulcerans infection in the Crl:IAF(HA)-hrBR hairless guinea pig. Method(s): Groups of five animals were exposed to total cumulative UV doses of 0 (control), 3 or 30kJ/m2 followed 3 days later by subcutaneous infection with 3 x 104 CFU of M. ulcerans in order to induce the nodular form of the disease. The resultant nodules were then measured for the next 22 days. The experiment was then repeated using intradermal infection with 2 x 106 CFU in order to induce the ulcerative form of the disease. The resultant ulcers were measured for the next 30 days. In both experiments, the animals were tested for delayed-type hypersensitivity (DTH) reactivity to Burulin-S as a marker of the onset of the reactive phase of the disease. Result(s): Following low inoculum subcutaneous infection, distinct, well-demarcated, subcutaneously situated skin nodules were present at infected skin sites between 7 and 22 days post-infection. Between days 14 and 21, the mean nodule diameters of the UV irradiated groups were significantly (P < 0.03) greater than that of the control group. UV pre-exposure resulted in significant (P < 0.035) suppression of DTH responses to Burulin-S challenge. High inoculum intradermal infection resulted in the development of ulcerative lesions. Between 10 and 30 days post-infection, the mean lesion diameters and mean ulcer development times of UV irradiated groups were significantly (P < 0.05) greater than those of the controls. However, UV irradiation did not affect DTH responses to Burulins in the high inoculum experiment. In both experiments, the lesions were histologically consistent with human Buruli ulcer disease. These results demonstrate that UV pre-exposure results in enhanced M. ulcerans infection in the hairless guinea pig model of Buruli ulcer disease and suggest that UV exposure may be a relevant factor in the pathogenesis of human forms of the disease.",Excluded

HBOT consisted of 30 sessions at 2.5 ATA (15 msw) with oxygen breathing for 90 min daily, 5 days per week, applied shortly after the RT treatment was completed. As of 2005, all patients received validated questionnaires (i.e., the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer [EORTC] QLQ-C30, EORTC QLQ Head and Neck Cancer Module (H&N35), Performance Status Scale): before treatment; at the start of RT treatment; after 46 Gy; at the end of RT treatment; and 2, 4, and 6 weeks and 3, 6, 12, and 18 months after follow-up., RESULTS: On all QoL items, better scores were obtained in patients treated with hyperbaric oxygen.

878,"Evaluation of [18F]Mefway biodistribution and dosimetry based on whole-body PET imaging of mice PURPOSE: [(18)F]Mefway is a novel radiotracer specific to the serotonin 5-HT1A receptor class. In preparation for using this tracer in humans, we have performed whole-body PET studies in mice to evaluate the biodistribution and dosimetry of [(18)F]Mefway.
METHODS: Six mice (three females and three males) received IV injections of [(18)F]Mefway and were scanned for 2 h in an Inveon-dedicated PET scanner. Each animal also received a high-resolution CT scan using an Inveon CT. The CT images were used to draw volume of interest on the following organs: the brain, large intestine, stomach, heart, kidneys, liver, lungs, pancreas, bone, spleen, testes, thymus, gallbladder, uterus, and urinary bladder. All organ time-activity curves without decay correction were normalized to the injected activity. The area under the normalized curves was then used to compute the residence times in each organ. Data were analyzed using PMOD and Matlab software. The absorbed doses in mouse organs were computed using the RAdiation Dose Assessment Resource animal models for dose assessment. The residence times in mouse organs were converted to human values using scale factors based on differences between organ and body weights. OLINDA/EXM 1.1 software was used to compute the absorbed human doses in multiple organs for both female and male phantoms.
RESULTS: The highest mouse residence times were found in the liver, urinary bladder, and kidneys. The largest doses in mice were found in the urinary bladder (critical organ), kidney, and liver for both females and males, indicating primary elimination via urinary system. The projected human effective doses were 1.21E - 02 mSv/MBq for the adult female model and 1.13E - 02 mSv/MBq for the adult male model. The estimated human biodistribution of [(18)F]Mefway was similar to that of [(11)C]WAY 100,635, a 5-HT1A tracer for which dosimetry has been evaluated in humans.
CONCLUSIONS: The elimination of radiotracer was primarily via the kidney and urinary bladder with the urinary bladder being the critical organ. Whole-body mouse imaging can be used as a preclinical tool to provide initial estimates of the absorbed doses of [(18)F]Mefway in humans.",Excluded
898,"Laboratory selection for an accelerated mosquito sexual development rate BACKGROUND: Separating males and females at the early adult stage did not ensure the virginity of females of Anopheles arabiensis (Dongola laboratory strain), whereas two years earlier this method had been successful. In most mosquito species, newly emerged males and females are not able to mate successfully. For anopheline species, a period of 24 h post-emergence is generally required for the completion of sexual maturation, which in males includes a 180° rotation of the genitalia. In this study, the possibility of an unusually shortened sexual maturity period in the laboratory-reared colony was investigated.
METHODS: The effect of two different sex-separation methods on the virginity of females was tested: females separated as pupae or less than 16 h post-emergence were mated with males subjected to various doses of radiation. T-tests were performed to compare the two sex-separation methods. The rate of genitalia rotation was compared for laboratory-reared and wild males collected as pupae in Dongola, Sudan, and analysed by Z-tests. Spermatheca dissections were performed on females mated with laboratory-reared males to determine their insemination status.
RESULTS: When the sex-separation was performed when adults were less than 16 h post-emergence, expected sterility was never reached for females mated with radio-sterilized males. Expected sterility was accomplished only when sexes were separated at the pupal stage. Observation of genitalia rotation showed that some males from the laboratory strain Dongola were able to successfully mate only 11 h after emergence and 42% of the males had already completed rotation. A small proportion of the same age females were inseminated. Wild males showed a much slower genitalia rotation rate. At 17 h post-emergence, 96% of the laboratory-reared males had completed genitalia rotation whereas none of the wild males had.
CONCLUSION: This colony has been cultured in the laboratory for over one hundred generations, and now has accelerated sexual maturation when compared with the wild strain. This outcome demonstrates the kinds of selection that can be expected during insect colonization and maintenance, particularly when generations are non-overlapping and similar-age males must compete for mates.",Excluded

PGN650 was labeled with 124I to create a positron emission tomography (PET) agent as an in vivo biomarker for tumor microenvironment and response to therapy. In this phase 0 study, we evaluated the pharmacokinetics, safety, radiation dosimetry, and tumor targeting of this tracer in a cohort of patients with cancer., METHODS: Eleven patients with known solid tumors received approximately 140 MBq (3.8 mCi) 124I-PGN650 intravenously and underwent positron emission tomography-computed tomography (PET/CT) approximately 1 hour, 3 hours, and either 24 hours or 48 hours later to establish tracer kinetics for the purpose of calculating radiation dosimetry (from integration of the organ time-activity curves and OLINDA/EXM using the adult male and female models)., RESULTS: Known tumor foci demonstrated mildly increased uptake, with the highest activity at the latest imaging time. There were no unexpected adverse events. The liver was the organ receiving the highest radiation dose (0.77 mGy/MBq); the effective dose was 0.41 mSv/MBq., CONCLUSION: Although 124I-PGN650 is safe for human PET imaging, the tumor targeting with this agent in patients was less than previously observed in animal studies.",Excluded
107,"Lymphocyte transformation to phytohaemagglutinin and delayed hypersensitivity related to age and previous cancer history Declining immunosurveillance in old age has been considered one possible explanation for the increased incidence of cancer in the elderly. This study was set up to search for evidence of persistent immunodeficiency in patients with a past history of cancer. Lymphocyte responses to phytohaemagglutinin and cutaneous delayed hypersensivity were assessed in fifty-seven elderly subjects who had successfully completed treatment for cancer more than 18 months previously and compared with those of forty-three healthy controls matched for age and sex. Although a significant difference between mean tritiated thymidine uptake was observed in the lymphocyte response to phytohaemagglutinin (cancer patients 1859 cpm, control 2502 cpm), this could be explained by an unexpectedly prolonged effect of radiotherapy. Mean counts for those twenty-six cancer patients receiving radiotherapy within the period 18 months to 4 years were low (1257 cpm), but were normal (2366 cpm) for the remainder. A significant negative correlation of lymphocyte transformation with age was confirmed in both groups. There was no significant difference in cutaneous delayed hypersensitivity response to commonly encountered antigens. Whilst recognising that these tests do not comprehensively assess immune function, the present results provide no support for the theory that an age-related decline in immune function contributes to the heightened incidence of cancer in the elderly.",Excluded

1072,"Influence of chronic UV exposure and lifestyle on facial skin photo-aging--results from a pilot study In order to better understand the effect of chronic sun exposure on facial skin photo-aging and to identify the factors affecting it, we planned a study in two areas in Japan, Akita and Kagoshima, which correspond to the low and high sun exposure environments, respectively. As a first step, we conducted a pilot study in the two areas, examining 195 subjects. Hyper-pigmentation and wrinkling were measured with a high-resolution digital video imaging system. As expected, people in Kagoshima had darker skin, higher visual grades of facial hyper-pigmentation, and more facial wrinkles than people in Akita, reflecting the difference of UV exposure levels in the two areas. Both the grades of hyper-pigmentation and number of wrinkles increased in a roughly linear fashion with the advancement of age. On the other hand, the effect of gender was different in those two skin photo-aging parameters. Women had higher hyper-pigmentation grades (P = 0.012) and less wrinkles (P = 0.004) than men. Interestingly, post-menopausal women had higher grades of hyper-pigmentation than pre-menopausal women. Neither sun exposure index for darkness nor wrinkling showed any significant differences by menopausal status. In this pilot study, we collected information on various factors, including life-styles. The results of detail analysis will be presented elsewhere. In the present analysis, we found that the grade of hyper-pigmentation was not related to total hours spent outside in life but was affected by various factors, including toe-nail zinc levels. On the other hand, the number of wrinkles was significantly related to total hours spent outside in life. The most important risk factors of non-melanoma skin cancer are chronic sun exposure, age and male sex. All of them are strongly related to higher levels of UV exposure. The present study confirmed that chronic sun exposure, age and male sex were strong risk factors of the wrinkle number. The number of wrinkles was significantly related to total hours of sun exposure in life, increased in a roughly linear fashion with the advancement of age, and was larger in men than in women. In epidemiological studies of UV-related skin cancer, the number of wrinkles, which can be easily measured with a high-resolution digital video imaging system as shown in this study, may be a good marker of total sun exposure in life.",Excluded
392,"A novel lunar bed rest analogue INTRODUCTION: Humans will eventually return to the Moon and thus there is a need for a ground-based analogue to enable the study of physiological adaptations to lunar gravity. An important unanswered question is whether or not living on the lunar surface will provide adequate loading of the musculoskeletal system to prevent or attenuate the bone loss that is seen in microgravity. Previous simulations have involved tilting subjects to an approximately 9.5 degrees angle to achieve a lunar gravity component parallel to the long-axis of the body. However, subjects in these earlier simulations were not weight-bearing, and thus these protocols did not provide an analogue for load on the musculoskeletal system., METHODS: We present a novel analogue which includes the capability to simulate standing and sitting in a lunar loading environment. A bed oriented at a 9.5 degrees angle was mounted on six linear bearings and was free to travel with one degree of freedom along rails. This allowed approximately 1/6 body weight loading of the feet during standing. Lunar"" sitting was also successfully simulated., RESULTS: A feasibility study demonstrated that the analogue was tolerated by subjects for 6 d of continuous bed rest and that the reaction forces at the feet during periods of standing were a reasonable simulation of lunar standing. During the 6 d, mean change in the volume of the quadriceps muscles was -1.6% +/- 1.7%., DISCUSSION: The proposed analogue would appear to be an acceptable simulation of lunar gravity and deserves further exploration in studies of longer duration.""",Excluded
1190,"Enhancing Cytogenetic Biological Dosimetry Capabilities of the Philippines for Nuclear Incident Preparedness The utility of a biological dosimeter based on the analysis of dicentrics is invaluable in the event of a radiological emergency wherein the estimated absorbed dose of an exposed individual is crucial in the proper medical management of patients. The technique is also used for routine monitoring of occupationally exposed workers to determine radiation exposure. An in vitro irradiation study of human peripheral blood lymphocytes was conducted to establish a dose-response curve for radiation-induced dicentric aberrations. Blood samples were collected from volunteer donors and together with optically stimulated luminescence (OSL) dosimeters and were irradiated at 0, 0.1, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1, 2, 4, and 6 Gy using a cobalt-60 radiotherapy unit. Blood samples were cultured for 48 h, and the metaphase chromosomes were prepared following the procedure of the International Atomic Energy Agency's Emergency Preparedness and Response - Biodosimetry 2011 manual. At least 100 metaphases were scored for dicentric aberrations at each dose point. The data were analyzed using R language program. The results indicated that the distribution of dicentric cells followed a Poisson distribution and the dose-response curve was established using the estimated model, Ydic = 0.0003 (+/-0.0003) +0.0336 (+/-0.0115) x D + 0.0236 (+/-0.0054) x D2. In this study, the reliability of the dose-response curve in estimating the absorbed dose was also validated for 2 and 4 Gy using OSL dosimeters. The data were fitted into the constructed curve. The result of the validation study showed that the obtained estimate for the absorbed exposure doses was close to the true exposure doses.",Included

Method(s): Between 2003 and 2009, 41 patients with 50 lesions confined to one organ from colorectal cancer (CRC) and treated with high dose SBRT <=45 Gy were retrospectively reviewed. Lymph nodes (LNs) (18 patients) were the most frequent sites followed in order by lung (12) and liver (11). SBRT doses ranged from 45 to 60 Gy in three fractions (median 48 Gy). The cumulative gross tumor volume (GTV) ranged from 2 to 123 ml (median 13 ml). Result(s): The median follow-up period from the SBRT date was 28 months (range, 6-65 months). The 3-year local control and overall survival rates were 64 and 60%, and the respective 5-year rates were 57 and 38%. Cumulative GTV and SBRT dose were statistically significant prognostic factors for local control. The grade 3 or 4 complications occurred in three patients (7%). Conclusion(s): High dose SBRT for colorectal oligometastases was found to produce results comparable with surgical series. To improve local control, dose higher than 48 Gy are recommend when possible, but further study will be required to define the optimal normal tissue constraints and acceptable toxicity.

1136,"Dosimetric predictors of xerostomia for head-and-neck cancer patients treated with the smart (simultaneous modulated accelerated radiation therapy) boost technique PURPOSE: To evaluate the predictors of xerostomia in the treatment of head-and-neck cancers treated with intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT), using the simultaneous modulated accelerated radiation therapy (SMART) boost technique. Dosimetric parameters of the parotid glands are correlated to subjective salivary gland function., MATERIALS AND METHODS: Between January 1996 and June 2000, 30 patients with at least 6 months follow-up were evaluated for subjective xerostomia after being treated definitively for head-and-neck cancer with the SMART boost technique. Threshold limits for the ipsilateral and contralateral parotid glands were 35 Gy and 25 Gy, respectively. Dosimetric parameters to the parotid glands were evaluated. The median follow-up time was 38.5 months (mean 39.9 months). The results of the dosimetric parameters and questionnaire were statistically correlated., RESULTS: Xerostomia was assessed with a 10-question subjective salivary gland function questionnaire. The salivary gland function questionnaire (questions 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, and 9) correlated significantly with the dosimetric parameters (mean and maximum doses and volume and percent above tolerance) of the parotid glands. These questions related to overall comfort, eating, and abnormal taste. Questions related to thirst, difficulty with speech or sleep, and the need to carry water daily did not correlate statistically with the dosimetric parameters of the parotid glands., CONCLUSIONS: Questions regarding overall comfort, eating, and abnormal taste correlated significantly with the dosimetric parameters of the parotid glands. Questions related to thirst, difficulty with speech or sleep, and the need to carry water daily did not correlate statistically with the dosimetric parameters of the parotid glands. Dosimetric sparing of the parotid glands improved subjective xerostomia. IMRT in the treatment of head-and-neck cancer can be exploited to preserve the parotid glands and decrease xerostomia. This is feasible even with an accelerated treatment regimen like the SMART boost. More patients need to be evaluated using IMRT to identify relevant dosimetric parameters.",Excluded

526,"Schistosoma mansoni phosphofructokinase : Immunolocalization in the tegument and immunogenicity Schistosoma mansoni depends for its survival on glycolysis. Two glycolytic enzymes, glyceraldehyde-3P-dehydrogenase and triose-phosphate dehydrogenase, found in both the adult and schistosomular tegument, hare been reported to confer partial protection against cercarial infection. This paper describes the immunogenic properties of phosphofructokinase (PFK), a rate-limiting enzyme of glycolysis, and its localization in the tegument and adjacent tissues. Recombinant schistosome PFK was used as antigen. A polyclonal antibody against purified PFK from Fasciola hepatica was affinity purified using recombinant PFR and used in combination with immunogold labelling to identify PFK by transmission electron microscopy in cryosections. In both adult worms and in schistosomula most immunogold label localized in the cytoplasmic syncytial region with less being found in the tegument. There was no significant PFK localization within or external to the outer membrane. Sera from mice immunized with recombinant S. mansoni PFK with Freund's adjuvant or alum plus rIL-12 demonstrated high titres of anti-PFK IgC, but no protection against cercarial infection. Sera from mice that were acutely or chronically infected or multiply exposed to irradiated cercariae did not recognize recombinant schistosome PFK in either Western blotting or ELISA. Similarly, sera from humans infected with S. mansoni did not recognize PFK. We conclude that in spite of the high immunogenicity of rPFK in mice, it is not a significant immunogen during the course of infection and does not confer protection from schistosomiasis. One main difference between PFK and the other 2 glycolytic enzymes seems to be the inaccessibility of PFK to the outside surface of the tegument.",Excluded
1144,"Cancer incidence among Danish Thorotrast-exposed patients BACKGROUND: Studies of groups of patients given injections of the alpha-emitting x-ray contrast medium Thorotrast may provide information on human alpha-ray carcinogenesis., PURPOSE: We re-established a formerly identified cohort of neurological patients receiving injections of Thorotrast for cerebral arteriography and assessed their incidence of cancer., METHODS: Using the national population register, the Danish Cancer Registry, and other registers, we determined the incidence of cancer among Thorotrast-injected patients. Incidence ratios were standardized to the general population and computed for different cancer sites., RESULTS: The cumulative risk for cancer at all sites (excluding brain tumors where the standardized incidence ratio [SIR] was 28) reached 86% 50 years after Thorotrast injection. SIR was greatly elevated at all sites except the brain and CNS (3.3, 95% confidence interval = 3.0-3.7), mainly because of liver cancers (SIR = 126) as well as leukemia (SIR = 10) for which a relationship was found between the time since injection and the estimated dose (but not the age at injection). Other sites with significantly increased risks of cancer included the gallbladder and extrahepatic bile ducts (SIR = 14), peritoneum (SIR = 8.6), sites of multiple myeloma (SIR = 4.6), metastatic sites (SIR = 12), and unspecified sites (SIR = 11). Cancers of the lung and breast also occurred in significant excess, but no relationship between SIR and volume of injected Thorotrast or time since injection was observed. Cancer risk was increased at most other sites, although this increase was not statistically significant., CONCLUSION: Alpha radiation may account for the increased risk of tumors of the liver, gallbladder, and peritoneum as well as leukemia and multiple myeloma, whereas confounding factors most probably contribute to the increased risks at other sites.",Excluded
338,"Reproducibility of intensity-based estimates of lung ventilation Purpose: Lung function depends on lung expansion and contraction during the respiratory cycle. Respiratory-gated CT imaging and image registration can be used to estimate the regional lung volume change by observing CT voxel density changes during inspiration or expiration. In this study, the authors examine the reproducibility of intensity-based estimates of lung tissue expansion and contraction in three mechanically ventilated sheep and ten spontaneously breathing humans. The intensity-based estimates are compared to the estimates of lung function derived from image registration deformation field. Method(s): 4DCT data set was acquired for a cohort of spontaneously breathing humans and anesthetized and mechanically ventilated sheep. For each subject, two 4DCT scans were performed with a short time interval between acquisitions. From each 4DCT data set, an image pair consisting of a volume reconstructed near end inspiration and a volume reconstructed near end exhalation was selected. The end inspiration and end exhalation images were registered using a tissue volume preserving deformable registration algorithm. The CT density change in the registered image pair was used to compute intensity-based specific air volume change (SAC) and the intensity-based Jacobian (IJAC), while the transformation-based Jacobian (TJAC) was computed directly from the image registration deformation field. IJAC is introduced to make the intensity-based and transformation-based methods comparable since SAC and Jacobian may not be associated with the same physiological phenomenon and have different units. Scan-to-scan variations in respiratory effort were corrected using a global scaling factor for normalization. A gamma index metric was introduced to quantify voxel-by-voxel reproducibility considering both differences in ventilation and distance between matching voxels. The authors also tested how different CT prefiltering levels affected intensity-based ventilation reproducibility. Result(s): Higher reproducibility was found for anesthetized mechanically ventilated animals than for the humans for both the intensity-based (IJAC) and transformation-based (TJAC) ventilation estimates. The human IJAC maps had scan-to-scan correlation coefficients of 0.45 +/- 0.14, a gamma pass rate 70 +/- 8 without normalization and 75 +/- 5 with normalization. The human TJAC maps had correlation coefficients 0.81 +/- 0.10, a gamma pass rate 86 +/- 11 without normalization and 93 +/- 4 with normalization. The gamma pass rate and correlation coefficient of the IJAC maps gradually increased with increased smoothing, but were still much lower than those of the TJAC maps. Conclusion(s): The transformation-based ventilation maps show better reproducibility than the intensity-based maps, especially in human subjects. Reproducibility was also found to depend on variations in respiratory effort; all techniques were better when applied to images from mechanically ventilated sheep compared to spontaneously breathing human subjects. Nevertheless, intensity-based techniques applied to mechanically ventilated sheep were less reproducible than the transformation-based applied to spontaneously breathing humans, suggesting the method used to determine ventilation maps is important. Prefiltering of the CT images may help to improve the reproducibility of the intensity-based ventilation estimates, but even with filtering the reproducibility of the intensity-based ventilation estimates is not as good as that of transformation-based ventilation estimates. © 2013 American Association of Physicists in Medicine.",Excluded
225,"Changes in X-ray sensitivity of mouse eggs from fertilization to the early pronuclear stage, and their repair capacity To study the changes in radiosensitivity of male and female genomes from fertilization to the pronuclear stage, the frequency of induced chromosome aberrations was examined at the first-cleavage metaphase in eggs fertilized with X-irradiated sperm, in eggs X-irradiated at the mature oocyte stage immediately before fertilization, and in fertilized eggs exposed to X-rays at various stages before DNA synthesis (1-5 h after insemination). Gametic treatment, fertilization and embryo culture were carried out in vitro. Most of the induced chromosome aberrations were chromosome-type aberrations, the frequency of chromosome fragments being the highest, followed by chromosome exchanges in both sperm and oocytes. The induction of chromosome-type aberrations was much higher in oocytes than in sperm. Chromosome-type aberrations were the main type also in fertilized eggs irradiated at the pre-DNA-synthetic stage. The radiosensitivity increased gradually with pronuclear formation (1-4h after insemination), but little difference in radiosensitivity was observed between eggs irradiated at 4 h and 5 h, corresponding to the stage when pronuclear formation was complete. The drastic change with pronuclear formation was found not only in radiosensitivity but also in the frequency of chromosome aberrations. The frequency of chromosome-type exchanges decreased drastically 2 h after insemination, and exchanges were barely observed at 5 h. The difference in radiosensitivity between male and female genomes also markedly changed with pronuclear formation, the chromosome aberration induction in the female genome being much higher than that in the male genome before accomplishment of pronuclear formation. The analysis of potentiation effects of 3-aminobenzamide and caffeine on the yield of X-ray-induced chromosome aberrations demonstrated that the increase of radiosensitivity and the decrease of chromosome-type exchange induction with pronuclear formation, may be closely correlated with alterations in chromatin configuration in the pronuclei and in repair capacity of fertilized eggs at the pre-DNA-synthetic stage. No evidence based on repair efficiency was found for the marked difference in radiosensitivity between male and female genomes during pronuclear formation.",Excluded
386,"Application of CareDose 4D combined with Karl 3D technology in the low dose computed tomography for the follow-up of COVID-19 BACKGROUND: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a highly infectious disease caused by the new coronavirus. Previous studies have shown that the chest CT examination plays an important role in the diagnosis and monitoring of COVID-19. However, some patients with COVID-19 had low white blood cell counts and reduced lymphocyte ratios. Multiple CT examinations may cause radiation damages as well as increase the apoptosis of peripheral blood lymphocytes. A new low-dose CT method should be developed because the regular CT may aggravate the disease., METHOD: Sixty cases were randomly divided into the study group (n = 30) and control group (n = 30). The lung window was reconstructed by Karl 3D iterative technique in the study group. The image quality was subjectively evaluated by two senior chest group diagnostic physicians using a 5-point double-blind method. The value of CT measurement and its standard deviation (SD) was used as an objective evaluation criteria. The volume of CT dose index (CTDIvol), dose length product (DLP) and effective dose (ED) from the two groups were compared and analyzed statistically., RESULT: There was no significant difference in the occurrence rates of ground glass opacities, consolidation, crazy-paving pattern, fiber cable shadow and axial interstitial thickening between the study group and control group (p > 0.05). In addition, no significant difference was found for the subjective score of overall image quality and image noise level (SD) between the two groups (p > 0.05). However, significant differences was found in CTDIvol, DLP, and ED between the study group and the control group (p < 0.05). The effective dose of the study group was reduced by 76% compared to the control group., CONCLUSION: CareDose 4D low-dose scanning combined with Karl 3D iterative reconstruction technology can not only greatly reduce the radiation dose, but also provide images that meet the diagnostic criteria of COVID-19, which can be used as a routine method for the follow-up of COVID-19 patients.",Excluded
86,"Influence of low-dose radiation on abscopal responses in patients receiving high-dose radiation and immunotherapy BACKGROUND: Preclinical evidence suggests that low-dose radiation may overcome the inhibitory effects of the tumor stroma and improve a tumor's response to immunotherapy, when combined with high-dose radiation to another tumor. The aim of this study was to evaluate tumor responses to this combination in a clinical setting., METHODS: A post-hoc analysis of 3 ongoing immunoradiation trials was performed. Twenty-six (of 155) patients received low-dose radiation (1-20 Gy total), either as scatter from high-dose radiation or from intentional treatment of a second isocenter with low-dose radiation, were evaluated for response. The low-dose lesions were compared to lesions that received no radiation (< 1 Gy total). Response rates, both defined as complete and partial responses as defined by RECIST criteria were used to compare lesion types., RESULTS: The 26 patients had a total of 83 lesions for comparison (38 receiving low-dose, 45 receiving no-dose). The average dose given to low-dose lesions was 7.3 Gy (1.1-19.4 Gy), and the average time to response was 56 days. Twenty-two out of 38 (58%) low-dose lesions met the PR/CR criteria for RECIST compared with 8 out of 45 (18%) no-dose lesions (P = 0.0001). The median change for longest diameter size for low-dose lesions was - 38.5% compared to 8% in no-dose lesions (P < 0.0001). Among the low-dose lesions that had at least one no-dose lesion within the same patient as a control (33 and 45 lesions respectively), 12 low-dose lesions (36%) responded without a corresponding response in their no-dose lesions; Conversely, two (4%) of the no-dose lesions responded without a corresponding response in their low-dose lesion (P = 0.0004)., CONCLUSIONS: Low-dose radiation may increase systemic response rates of metastatic disease treated with high-dose radiation and immunotherapy.",Excluded

413,"Soft-tissue allografts terminally sterilized with an electron beam are biomechanically equivalent to aseptic, nonsterilized tendons BACKGROUND: Allograft safety is contingent on effective sterilization. However, current sterilization methods have been associated with decreased biomechanical strength and higher failure rates of soft-tissue allografts. In this study, electron beam (e-beam) sterilization was explored as an alternative sterilization method to preserve biomechanical integrity. We hypothesized that e-beam sterilization would not significantly alter the biomechanical properties of tendon allograft compared with aseptic, nonsterilized controls and gamma-irradiated grafts., METHODS: Separate sets of forty fresh-frozen tibialis tendon allografts (four from each of ten donors) and forty bisected bone-patellar tendon-bone (BTB) allografts (four from each of ten donors) were randomly assigned to four study groups. One group received a 17.1 to 21.0-kGy gamma radiation dose; two other groups were sterilized with an e-beam at either a high (17.1 to 21.0-kGy) or low (9.2 to 12.2-kGy) dose. A fourth group served as nonsterilized controls. Each graft was cyclically loaded to 200 N of tension for 2000 cycles at a frequency of 2 Hz, allowed to relax for five minutes, and then tested in tension until failure at a 100%/sec strain rate. One-way analysis of variance testing was used to identify significant differences., RESULTS: Tibialis tendons sterilized with both e-beam treatments and with gamma irradiation exhibited values for cyclic tendon elongation, maximum load, maximum displacement, stiffness, maximum stress, maximum strain, and elastic modulus that were not significantly different from those of nonsterilized controls. BTB allografts sterilized with the high e-beam dose and with gamma irradiation were not significantly different in cyclic tendon elongation, maximum load, maximum displacement, stiffness, maximum stress, maximum strain, and elastic modulus from nonsterilized controls. BTB allografts sterilized with the e-beam at the lower dose were significantly less stiff than nonsterilized controls (p = 0.014) but did not differ from controls in any other properties. The difference in stiffness likely resulted from variations in tendon size rather than the treatments, as the elastic moduli of the groups were similar., CONCLUSIONS: The biomechanical properties of tibialis and BTB allografts sterilized with use of an e-beam at a dose range of 17.1 to 21.0 kGy were not different from those of aseptic, nonsterilized controls or gamma-irradiated allografts., CLINICAL RELEVANCE: E-beam sterilization can be a viable method to produce safe and biomechanically uncompromised soft-tissue allografts.

711,"Detectability of radiation-induced changes in magnetic resonance biomarkers following stereotactic radiosurgery: A pilot study Our objective was to investigate direct voxel-wise relationship between dose and early MR biomarker changes both within and in the high-dose region surrounding brain metastases following stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS). Specifically, we examined the apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) from diffusion-weighted imaging and the contrast transfer coefficient (Ktrans) and volume of extracellular extravascular space (ve) derived from dynamic contrast-enhanced (DCE) MRI data. We investigated 29 brain metastases in 18 patients using 3 T MRI to collect imaging data at day 0, day 3 and day 20 following SRS. The ADC maps were generated by the scanner and Ktrans and ve maps were generated using in-house software for dynamic tracer-kinetic analysis. To enable spatially-correlated voxel-wise analysis, we developed a registration pipeline to register all ADC, Ktrans and ve maps to the planning MRI scan. To interrogate longitudinal changes, we computed absolute DELTAADC, DELTAKtrans and DELTAve for day 3 and 20 post-SRS relative to day 0. We performed a Kruskall-Wallice test on each biomarker between time points and investigated dose correlations within the gross tumour volume (GTV) and surrounding high dose region > 12 Gy via Spearman's rho. Only ve exhibited significant differences between day 0 and 20 (p < 0.005) and day 3 and 20 (p < 0.05) within the GTV following SRS. Strongest dose correlations were observed for ADC within the GTV (rho = 0.17 to 0.20) and weak correlations were observed for ADC and Ktrans in the surrounding > 12 Gy region. Both DELTAKtrans and DELTAve showed a trend with dose at day 20 within the GTV and > 12 Gy region (rho = -0.04 to -0.16). Weak dose-related decreases in Ktrans and ve within the GTV and high dose region at day 20 most likely reflect underlying vascular responses to radiation. Our study also provides a voxel-wise analysis schema for future MR biomarker studies with the goal of elucidating surrogates for radionecrosis.",Excluded
1242,"Radiation therapy in the treatment of partially resected meningiomas To address the question of whether radiation therapy is beneficial in the management of partially resected meningiomas, we reviewed the records of all patients admitted to the University of California, San Francisco, between 1968 and 1978 who had a diagnosis of intracranial meningioma. The patients were divided into three groups: 51 patients had gross total resection and did not receive radiation therapy, 30 patients had subtotal resection and no radiation therapy, and 54 patients had subtotal resection followed by radiation therapy. The subtotal resection groups were similar in average age, male:female ratio, and tumor location, which allowed a valid comparison of the effects of irradiation. The recurrence rate in the total resection group was 4% (2 of 51 patients). Among patients in the subtotal resection groups, 60% of nonirradiated patients had a recurrence, compared with only 32% of the irradiated patients. The median time to recurrence was significantly longer in the irradiated group than in the nonirradiated group (125 vs. 66 months, P less than 0.05). There was no complication related to irradiation. These results provide convincing evidence that radiation therapy is beneficial in the treatment of partially resected meningiomas.",Included
678,"An open-label, prospective pilot clinical study of denosumab for severe hyperparathyroidism in patients with low bone mass undergoing dialysis CONTEXT: Denosumab is widely used for bone diseases with increased bone resorption. Its effectiveness in patients with severe secondary hyperparathyroidism on dialysis is unclear.
OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of denosumab in patients with severe secondary hyperparathyroidism who are on dialysis.
DESIGN: This 6-month prospective, open-labeled study evaluated 12 patients (five women, seven men; mean age 53.5 ± 3.8 y). All had intact PTH (iPTH; > 1000 pg/mL), low bone mass (T-score < -1.0 SD), and bone pain and were poor surgical candidates. Serum calcium, phosphorus, alkaline phosphatase (AP), and iPTH levels were assessed at baseline and every month thereafter. Vertebral spine x-rays and bone mineral densities (BMDs) (lumbar spine and femoral neck) were assessed at the start and end of the study. All patients received denosumab (60 mg), calcitriol, phosphate binders, and dialysate calcium that were adjusted according to the biochemistry data.
RESULTS: The BMD increased in both the femoral neck (mean increase 23.7% ± 4.0%) and lumbar spine (17.1% ± 2.6%) after 6 months. In the first month, most patients had increased iPTH levels, which dramatically decreased from 1702.1 ± 181.9 to 518.8 ± 126.8 pg/mL by the end of the study after increasing the calcitriol dose. All patients had significant decreases in AP, calcium × phosphorus, and bone pain. Changes in femoral neck BMD correlated only with AP and iPTH levels.
CONCLUSIONS: Denosumab is effective in restoring bone mass and reducing bone pain in patients on dialysis with secondary hyperparathyroidism. It also allows for a more aggressive use of calcitriol to control hyperparathyroidism.",Excluded

We prospectively investigated the differences in radiation exposure related to collimation in Medial Branch Block (MBB)., METHODS: This study was a randomized controlled trial of 62 MBBs at L3, 4 and 5. After the patient was laid in the prone position on the operating table, MBB was conducted and only AP projections of the fluoroscope were used. Based on a concealed random number table, MBB was performed with (collimation group) and without (control group) collimation. The data on the patient's age, height, gender, laterality (right/left), radiation absorbed dose (RAD), exposure time, distance from the center of the field to the operator, and effective dose (ED) at the side of the table and at the operator's chest were collected. The brightness of the fluoroscopic image was evaluated with histogram in Photoshop., RESULTS: There were no significant differences in age, height, weight, male to female ratio, laterality, time, distance and brightness of fluoroscopic image. The area of the fluoroscopic image with collimation was 67% of the conventional image.

955,"Radiation therapy for oncological emergencies AIMS AND BACKGROUND: Radiation therapy holds a fundamental role in oncological emergencies such as superior vena cava syndrome, spinal cord compression and endocranial hypertension. The purpose of our study was, by comparing schedules of treatment, to confirm the efficacy of hypofractionated radiation therapy., METHODS: From January 1994 to December 1998, 43 patients with superior vena cava syndrome, 37 patients with metastatic spinal cord compression and 108 patients with endocranial hypertension secondary to metastasis were treated at our institution. In the group of patients with superior vena cava syndrome, radiotherapy schedules were: 4 Gy x 5 to a total dose of 20 Gy (23 patients) and 3 Gy x 10 to a total dose of 30 Gy (20 patients). In the group of patients with spinal cord compression, radiation schedules were: 3 Gy x 10 to a total dose of 30 Gy (15 patients); 4 Gy x 5 to a total dose of 20 Gy (12 patients); a single fraction of 8 Gy in 10 cases, repeated after 1 week in 7 responder cases to a total dose of 16 Gy. 5 out of 37 patients were underwent to laminectomy plus stabilization of the spine and post-operative radiotherapy. In the group of patients with endocranial hypertension, radiotherapy schedules were: 6 Gy x 2 to a total dose of 12 Gy (53 patients), repeated after 4 weeks in 34 responder patients and 3 Gy x 10 to a total dose of 30 Gy (55 patients)., RESULTS: The patients with superior vena cava syndrome, revaluated after 4 weeks at the end of treatment, obtained a partial remission of symptomatology in 73.9% with 20 Gy and in 75% with 30 Gy. The patients with spinal cord compression obtained symptomatic relief in 73.3% with 30 Gy, in 66.6% with 20 Gy and in 70% of cases treated with 8 Gy. The patients with endocranial hypertension obtained symptomatic relief in 64.1% with 12 Gy and in 63.3% with 30 Gy., CONCLUSION: Histology, pretreatment and performance status were important prognostic factors for the response to therapy. Our results demonstrated no significant difference among different schedules of radiotherapy and confirmed the importance of radiotherapy for oncological emergencies: it improves the quality of life and, in responding patients, is associated with a longer survival time.",Excluded
806,"Radiation-induced sarcoma: A challenge for the surgeon Background: Treatment of radiation-induced sarcoma (RIS) remains an unsolved problem. To provide more insight into the disease process, its characteristics, outcome, and potential outcome determinants were defined. Method(s): From 1978 to 2003, 27 patients-20 females (74%) and 7 males (26%) with a median age 44 years (range, 1-73 years) at the time of diagnosis of the primary tumor-developed an RIS after a median interval of 8 years (range, 3-41 years). The histology of the RIS was 10 (37%) undifferentiated high-grade pleomorphic sarcomas, 7 (26%) angiosarcomas, 6 (22%) fibrosarcomas, 2 (7%) osteosarcomas, 1 (4%) pleomorphic rhabdomyosarcoma, and 1 (4%) pleomorphic leiomyosarcoma. Surgical resection was performed in 21 patients: 13 (62%) R0 (microscopically radical), 4 (19%) R1 (microscopically irradical), 2 (9.5%) R2 (macroscopically irradical), and 2 (9.5%) RX (unknown radicality). Six (22%) patients underwent no resection. Result(s): The 5-year disease-free and overall survival rates were 27% and 30%, respectively. The local failure rate after R0 resection was 54%. The distant failure rate for the entire group was 41%. Patients with an R0 resection had a significantly better survival rate (P < .05) than patients with an R1, R2, or no resection. Conclusion(s): RISs are aggressive malignancies with a high tendency for local recurrence and distant metastases. Previously applied treatment often hampers adequate resection. Therefore, radical surgical resection is the only chance to improve disease-free and overall survival, but it may also have a palliative role. Still, the overall prognosis remains poor. © 2005 The Society of Surgical Oncology, Inc.",Excluded
695,"Analysis of the relationship between tumor dose inhomogeneity and local control in patients with skull base chordoma PURPOSE: When irradiating a tumor that abuts or displaces any normal structures, the dose constraints to those structures (if lower than the prescribed dose) may cause dose inhomogeneity in the tumor volume at the tumor-critical structure interface. The low-dose region in the tumor volume may be one of the reasons for local failure. The aim of this study is to quantitate the effect of tumor dose inhomogeneity on local control and recurrence-free survival in patients with skull base chordoma., METHODS AND MATERIALS: 132 patients with skull base chordoma were treated with combined photon and proton irradiation between 1978 and 1993. This study reviews 115 patients whose dose-volume data and follow-up data are available. The prescribed doses ranged from 66.6 Cobalt-Gray-Equivalent (CGE) to 79.2 CGE (median of 68.9 CGE). The dose to the optic structures (optic nerves and chiasm), the brain stem surface, and the brain stem center was limited to 60, 64, and 53 CGE, respectively. We used the dose-volume histogram data derived with the three-dimensional treatment planning system to evaluate several dose-volume parameters including the Equivalent Uniform Dose (EUD). We also analyzed several other patient and treatment factors in relation to local control and recurrence-free survival., RESULTS: Local failure developed in 42 of 115 patients, with the actuarial local control rates at 5 and 10 years being 59% and 44%. Gender was a significant predictor for local control with the prognosis in males being significantly better than that in females (P = 0.004, hazard ratio = 2.3). In a Cox univariate analysis, with stratification by gender, the significant predictors for local control (at the probability level of 0.05) were EUD, the target volume, the minimum dose, and the D5cc dose. The prescribed dose, histology, age, the maximum dose, the mean dose, the median dose, the D90% dose, and the overall treatment time were not significant factors. In a Cox multivariate analysis, the models including gender and EUD, or gender and the target volume, or gender and the minimum target dose were significant. The more biologically meaningful of these models is that of gender and EUD., CONCLUSION: This study suggests that the probability of recurrence of skull base chordomas depends on gender, target volume, and the level of target dose inhomogeneity. EUD was shown to be a useful parameter to evaluate dose distribution for the target volume.",Excluded

Outcomes, radiation-related complications, and adverse effects were documented. Mortality and local control rates were calculated by the Kaplan-Meier survival probability method.
RESULTS: Eight patients met the inclusion criteria; of these, 6 (75%) were men and 2 (25%) were women, with ages ranging from 38 to 65 years (mean 50 years). One tumor (12.5%) was classified as T2N0M0, 6 (75%) were classified as T3N0M0, and one (12.5%) was classified as T4N0M0. Follow up from electron beam radiation therapy ranged from 3 to 72 months (mean 30.25 months). The most common side effect was erythema and edema of the eyelids with diffuse transient eyelash loss, seen in all patients. Tumor local control and regression after electron beam radiation therapy were noted in 6 patients (75%); recurrence was noted in 2. There was neither metastatic spread nor tumor-related deaths.
CONCLUSIONS: The authors report a small case series where local tumor control was achieved with electron beam radiation therapy for recalcitrant squamous cell carcinoma of the conjunctiva and cornea. This approach may be considered for patients who fail conventional therapy.",Excluded

280,"Sorafenib acts synergistically in combination with radiotherapy without causing intestinal damage in colorectal cancer AIMS AND BACKGROUND: Colorectal cancer is one of the commonest cancers. Chemoradiotherapy gives better results than radiotherapy or chemotherapy in colorectal cancer. To enhance radiosensitivity of tumor cells for chemoradiotherapy, targeted therapy drugs that act as radiosensitizers can be used. In the present study, we provide a scientific rationale for the clinical application of sorafenib as a radiosensitizer in colorectal cancer, without causing significant adverse effects on normal intestinal tissue., METHODS: Three human colorectal adenocarcinoma cell lines (HCT116, HT-29, and SW480) were treated with sorafenib alone, or radiation followed by sorafenib. In vitro tests were performed using colony forming assays, cell cycle analysis, and comet assays. In addition, the effects of sorafenib and radiation therapy on the inhibition HT-29 tumor growth and survival of intestinal jejunum crypts were examined in vivo., RESULTS: Sorafenib increased the radiosensitivity of tumor cells in human colon adenocarcinoma cell lines (HCT116, HT-29, and SW480), as well as in HT-29 xenograft animal models. Sorafenib, in combination with ionizing radiation, induced the accumulation of tumor cells in the G2-M phase and delayed the repair of DNA damage caused by ionizing radiation. The combination of sorafenib and ionizing radiation did not enhance the apoptosis of intestinal crypt cells, compared with the use of radiation alone., CONCLUSIONS: We provide a scientific rationale for the use of sorafenib in combination with radiotherapy in colorectal cancer.",Excluded
15,"Radioembolization of symptomatic, unresectable neuroendocrine hepatic metastases using yttrium-90 microspheres PURPOSE: To evaluate safety, efficacy, and symptom-control of radioembolization in patients with unresectable liver metastases from neuroendocrine tumors (NETLMs)., MATERIALS AND METHODS: Forty-two patients (mean age of 62 years) with treatment-refractory NETLMs underwent radioembolization using yttrium-90 ((90)Y) resin microspheres. Posttreatment tumor response was assessed by cross-sectional imaging using the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) and tumor-marker levels. Laboratory and clinical toxicities and clinical symptoms were monitored., RESULTS: The median activity delivered was 1.63 GBq (range 0.63-2.36). Imaging follow-up using RECIST at 3-month follow-up demonstrated partial response, stable disease, and progressive disease in 22.5, 75.0, and 2.5% of patients, respectively. In 97.5% of patients, the liver lesions appeared hypovascular or partially necrotic. The mean follow-up was 16.2 months with 40 patients (95.2%) remaining alive. The median decrease in tumor-marker levels at 3 months was 54.8% (chromogranin A) and 37.3% (serotonin), respectively. There were no acute or delayed toxicities greater than grade 2 according to Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events [CTCAE (v3.0)]. No radiation-induced liver disease was noted. Improvement of clinical symptoms 3 months after treatment was observed in 36 of 38 symptomatic patients., CONCLUSION: Radioembolization with (90)Y-microspheres is a safe and effective treatment option in patients with otherwise treatment-refractory NETLMs. Antitumoral effect is supported by good local tumor control, decreased tumor-marker levels, and improved clinical symptoms. Further investigation is warranted to define the role of radioembolization in the treatment paradigm for NETLMs.",Excluded
454,"Residential radon exposure and lung cancer--an epidemiological study of Norwegian municipalities The study is based on a collaboration between the Cancer Registry of Norway, the Norwegian Radiation Protection Authority, and National Radiological Protection Board (NRPB, UK). The association between indoor radon exposure and lung cancer was studied in 427 municipalities. NRPB detectors were sent to 10,000 households, and 7,500 of the detectors were returned. Data from a nation-wide survey of smoking habits in 1964-1965 were available. Data on asbestos exposure were also used in a regression analysis. The reporting to the Cancer Registry of all new cases of cancer is fairly complete, as hospital departments and institutes of pathology are obliged to report all cancer cases. The histologically confirmed lung cancer cases were grouped into squamous-cell carcinoma, small-cell carcinoma, adenocarcinoma and other or non-specified histological types. The age-adjusted rate of lung cancer by histological type was the dependent variable in the regression analysis. A consistent increase in incidence of lung cancer was seen with increasing tobacco consumption, but no positive trend could be shown with increasing radon exposure in the descriptive presentation of the data. In the regression analysis, however, the incidence of small-cell anaplastic lung tumors in females increased significantly with increasing radon exposure. When based on the regression coefficients, the fraction of lung cancers attributable to radon is about 2-4%. However, systematic errors cannot be excluded in an ecological study such as presented here.",Excluded
147,"Carbon ion radiotherapy for patients with hepatocellular carcinoma in the caudate lobe carbon ion radiotherapy for hepatocellular carcinoma in caudate lobe Aim: The treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma in the caudate lobe (HCCCL) is technically challenging. We aimed to investigate the efficacy and toxicity of carbon ion radiotherapy (C-ion RT) for HCCCL. Method(s): Patients with HCCCL treated with C-ion RT at our hospital between January 2011 and December 2018 were evaluated. The total dose was 52.8 or 60 Gy (relative biological effectiveness) in four or 12 fractions depending on the distance between the tumor and the gastrointestinal tract. The survival outcome, the presence or absence of recurrence (local recurrence, intrahepatic recurrence outside the irradiation field, or extrahepatic recurrence), and acute/late adverse events were evaluated. Result(s): Nine patients were included. The median tumor size was 3.4 cm, and the median follow-up duration was 18.3 months for all patients. No patient developed local recurrence during follow-up. Five patients subsequently developed intrahepatic recurrence outside the irradiation field and two had extrahepatic metastasis. Five patients died of hepatocellular carcinoma. No acute adverse events of grade >=2 were observed. Two patients experienced grade 2 or 3 late adverse events, including obstructive jaundice, hepatic encephalopathy, ascites, and edema. Conclusion(s): Carbon ion radiotherapy for HCCCL achieved excellent local control with acceptable adverse events and can thus be a curative treatment option for HCCCL.Copyright © 2020 The Japan Society of Hepatology",Excluded

To compare the effects of Fexofenadine, Chlorpheneramine and Betametasone on eosinophil count and IgE levels. To compare the cost effectiveness of the Fexofenadine, Chlorpheneramine and Betametasone in the treatment of Allergic Rhinitis. Material(s) and Method(s): A prospective study was done over a period of 1 month (20th July 2012 to 20th August 2012) over 75 people aged between 15 to 45 years including males and females at Warangal. They were divided into 3 groups. Group I (n: 25) used Fexofenadine 120 mg, O.D., for 14 days. Group II (n: 25) used CPM 4 mg, O.D., for 14 days. Group III (n: 25) used Betametasone 0.5 mg, B.D., for 7 days. Presenting complaints with duration, personal history of exposure to any allergens, family history of any allergies, general examination of the patient, ENT examination, Investigations: CBP with DLC, Absolute eosinophil count, X-Ray of paranasal sinuses, Skin test for allergy, IgE levels in the serum. Result(s): The three drugs Fexofenadine, Chlorpheneramine and Betametasone were found to have similar levels of efficacy in controlling the symptoms of allergic rhinitis. The physical signs improved better with Chlorpheneramine than the other two drugs. Fexofenadine was found to be most effective in suppression of skin reactions to the allergens. It was closely followed by Betametasone and then Chlorpheneramine. The anti-histamine, Fexofenadine and Chlorpheneramine had no significant effect on the absolute eosinophil count and serum IgE levels whereas Betametasone had significant effect. The Cost burden is extremely low on patients using CPM followed by betamethasone than n fexofenadine. Conclusion(s): According to the results Fexofenadine, CPM Betamethasone have almost equally therapeutic efficacy. Betamethasone cannot be given for very long time because of its wide range of side effects. In rural place like Warangal(KMC) where people can't effort money for treatment, CPM is the better drugbecause it has equal therapeutic efficacy and cost burden is very less compared to othersit is at an affordableprice.",Excluded
428,"Scattering matrix imaging pulse design for real-time respiration and cardiac motion monitoring PURPOSE: The scattering matrix (S-matrix) of a parallel transmit (pTx) coil is sensitive to physiological motion but requires additional monitoring RF pulses to be measured. In this work, we present and evaluate pTx RF pulse designs that simultaneously excite for imaging and measure the S-matrix to generate real-time motion signals without prolonging the image sequence., THEORY AND METHODS: Three pTx waveforms for measuring the S-matrix were identified and superimposed onto the imaging excitation RF pulses: (1) time division multiplexing, (2) frequency division multiplexing, and (3) code division multiplexing. These 3 methods were evaluated in healthy volunteers for scattering sensitivity and image artefacts. The S-matrix and real-time motion signals were calculated on the image calculation environment of the MR scanner. Prospective cardiac triggers were identified in early systole as a high rate of change of the cardiac motion signal. Monitoring accuracy was compared against electrocardiogram or the imaged diaphragm position., RESULTS: All 3 monitoring approaches measure the S-matrix during image excitation with quality correlated to input power. No image artefacts were observed for frequency multiplexing, and low energy artefacts were observed in the other methods. The accuracy of the achieved prospective cardiac gating was 15 +/- 16 ms for breath hold and 24 +/- 17 ms during free breathing. The diaphragm position prediction accuracy was 1.3 +/- 0.9 mm. In all volunteers, good quality cine images were acquired for breath hold scans and dual gated CINEs were demonstrated., CONCLUSION: The S-matrix can be measured during image excitation to generate real-time cardiac and respiratory motion signals for prospective gating. No artefacts are introduced when frequency division multiplexing is used. Copyright © 2019 The Authors.

Patients were separated in two groups: patients affected by mucositis (MUCOSITIS) and patient without mucositis (NO MUCOSITIS). All patients were divided in function of the anticancer treatment: patients who had radiotherapy (MUCOSITIS RADIO), had not radiotherapy (MUCOSITIS NO RADIO), had chemotherapy (MUCOSITIS CHEMO), and those who had not chemotherapy (MUCOSITIS NO CHEMO). Statistical evaluation PCA (Principal Component Analysis) was conducted with the software BIO-RAD Data Manager( TM) (Version 3.5)., RESULTS: We found the increased peaks of 3443, 3487, and 4135 m/z in MUCOSITIS group, while 6237 m/z was reduced. These same peaks would the same modifications in MUCOSITIS RADIO, while in MUCOSITIS CHEMIO are increased 3443 and 6237 m/z but 3487, 4135 m/z are reduced. These data were confirmed by the PCA., CONCLUSION: Anticancer therapy influenced the level expression of many salivary biomarkers in mucositis with a good significance.

Coronary artery segments were assessed for image quality and significant luminal diameter narrowing. Sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive values (PPV), negative predictive values (NPV), and accuracy of both CTCA groups were determined using conventional catheter angiography (CCA) as reference standard. Radiation dose values were calculated., RESULTS: Both groups were comparable regarding gender, body weight, cardiovascular risk profile, severity of CAD, mean heart rate, heart rate variability, and Agatston score (all p>0.05). There was no significant difference in the rate of non-assessable coronary segments between group 1 (1.6%, 24/1404) and group 2 (1.4%, 19/1385; p=0.77); non-diagnostic image quality was significantly (p<0.001) more often attributed to stair step artifacts in group 1. Segment-based sensitivity, specificity, PPV, NPV, and accuracy were 98%, 98%, 88%, 100%, and 100% among group 1; 96%, 99%, 90%, 100%, and 98% among group 2, respectively. Parameters of diagnostic performance were similar (all p>0.05). Mean effective radiation dose of prospectively ECG-gated CTCA (2.2+/-0.4 mSv) was significantly (p<0.0001) smaller than that of retrospectively ECG-gated CTCA (8.1+/-0.6 mSv)., CONCLUSION: Prospectively ECG-gated CTCA yields similar image quality, performs as accurately as retrospectively ECG-gated CTCA in patients having heart rates <=70 bpm while being associated with a lower mean effective radiation dose.

393,"[Phosphorylation of histone H2AX in human lymphocytes as a possible marker of effective cellular response to ionizing radiation] DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) which occurs in cells after ionizing radiation (IR) or chemical agents are the most dangerous lesions in eukariotic cells, which leads to cell death or chromosome abberations and cancer. One of the earliest response of cells to DSBs formation is phosphorylation by 139 serine of core variant histone H2AX in megabase chromatin domains around DSB (gamma-H2AX), which amplify signal and makes it possible to identify even one DSB in genome. Effective formation of gamma-H2AX is very important for maintenance of genome stability. Here, using immunofluorescent and Western blotting techniques, we studied dynamics of gamma-H2AX formation in human lymphocytes of various individuals irradiated ex vivo. We have found that dynamics of gamma-H2AX formation in lymphocytes differ between individuals but have similar kinetics and statistically is independent on people age.",Included
788,"G2 repair and chromosomal damage in lymphocytes from workers occupationally exposed to low-level ionizing radiation The effect of the G2 repair of chromosomal damage in lymphocytes from workers exposed to low levels of X- or gamma-rays was evaluated. Samples of peripheral blood were collected from 15 radiation workers, 20 subjects working in radiodiagnostics, and 30 healthy control donors. Chromosomal aberrations (CA) were evaluated by scoring the presence of chromatid and isochromatid breaks, dicentric and ring chromosomes in lymphocytes with/without 5 mM caffeine plus 3 mM-aminobenzamide (3-AB) treatment during G2. Our results showed that the mean value of basal aberrations in lymphocytes from exposed workers was higher than in control cells (p < 0.001). The chromosomal damage in G2, detected with caffeine plus 3-AB treatment was higher than the basal damage (untreated conditions), both in control and exposed populations (p < 0.05). In the exposed workers group, the mean value of chromosomal abnormalities in G2 was higher than in the control (p < 0.0001). No correlation was found between the frequency of chromosome type of aberrations (basal or in G2), and the absorbed dose. Nevertheless, significant correlation coefficients (p < 0.05) between absorbed dose and basal aberrations yield (r = 0.430) or in G2 (r = 0.448) were detected when chromatid breaks were included in the total aberrations yield. Under this latter condition no significant effect of age, years of employment or smoking habit on the chromosomal aberrations yield was detected. However, analysis of the relationship between basal aberrations yield and the efficiency of G2 repair mechanisms, defined as the percentage of chromosomal lesions repaired in G2, showed a significant correlation coefficient (r = -0.802; p < 0.001). These results suggest that in addition to the absorbed dose, the individual G2 repair efficiency may be another important factor affecting the chromosomal aberrations yield detected in workers exposed to low-level ionizing radiation.",Included
480,"Evaluation of cancer tests of 1,3-butadiene using internal dose, genotoxic potency, and a multiplicative risk model In cancer tests with 1,3-butadiene (BD), the mouse is much more sensitive than the rat. This is considered to be related to the metabolism of BD to the epoxide metabolites, 1,2-epoxy-3-butene (EB), 1,2:3,4-diepoxybutane, and 1,2-epoxy-3,4-butanediol. This study evaluates whether the large difference in outcome in cancer tests with BD could be predicted quantitatively on the basis of the concentration over time in blood (AUC) of the epoxide metabolites, their mutagenic potency, and a multiplicative cancer risk model, which has earlier been used for ionizing radiation. Published data on hemoglobin adduct levels from inhalation experiments with BD were used for the estimation of the AUC of the epoxide metabolites in the cancer tests. The estimated AUC of the epoxides were then weighed together to a total genotoxic dose, by using the relative genotoxic potency of the respective epoxide inferred from in vitro hprt mutation assays using EB as standard. The tumor incidences predicted with the risk model on the basis of the total genotoxic dose correlated well with the earlier observed tumor incidences in the cancer tests. The total genotoxic dose that leads to a doubling of the tumor incidences was estimated to be the same in both species, 9 to 10 mmol/Lxh EB-equivalents. The study validates the applicability of the multiplicative cancer risk model to genotoxic chemicals. Furthermore, according to this evaluation, different epoxide metabolites are predominating cancer-initiating agents in the cancer tests with BD, the diepoxide in the mouse, and the monoepoxides in the rat.",Excluded

761,"Expandable self-locking nail in the management of closed diaphyseal fractures of femur and tibia BACKGROUND: Intramedullary fixation is the treatment of choice for closed diaphyseal fractures of femur and tibia. The axial and rotational stability of conventional interlocking nails depends primarily on locking screws. This method uses increased operating time and increased radiation exposure. An intramedullary implant that can minimize these disadvantages is obviously better. Expandable intramedullary nail does not rely on interlocking screws and achieves axial and rotational stability on hydraulic expansion of the nail. We analyzed 32 simple fractures of shaft of femur and tibia treated by self-locking expandable nail., MATERIALS AND METHODS: Intramedullary fixation was done by using self-locking, expandable nail in 32 patients of closed diaphyseal fractures of tibia (n = 10) and femur (n = 22). The various modes of injury were road traffic accidents (n = 21), fall from height (n = 8), simple fall (n = 2), and pathological fracture (n = 1). Among femoral diaphyseal fractures 16 were males and six females, average age being 33 yrs (range, 18- 62 yrs). Seventeen patients had AO type A (A1 (n = 3), A2 (n = 4), A3 (n = 10)) and 5 patients had AO type B (B1 (n = 2), B2 (n = 2), B3 (n = 1)) fractures. Eight patients having tibial diaphyseal fractures were males and two were females; average age was 29.2 (range, 18- 55 yrs). Seven were AO type A (A1 (n = 2), A2 (n = 3), A3 (n = 2)) and three were AO type B (B1 (n = 1), B2 (n = 1), and B3 (n = 1)). We performed closed (n = 27) or open reduction (n = 5) and internal fixation with expandable nail to stabilize these fractures. The total radiation exposure during surgery was less as no locking screws were required. Early mobilisation and weight-bearing was started depending on fracture personality and evidences of healing. Absence of localised tenderness and pain on walking was considered clinical criteria for union, radiographic criteria of union being continuity in at least in three cortices in both AP and lateral views. Patients were followed for at least one year., RESULTS: The average operative time was 90 min (range, 55-125 min) for femoral fractures and 53 min (range, 25-115 min) for tibial fractures. Radiation exposure was minimum, average being 84 seconds (range, 54-132) for femoral fractures and 54 seconds (range, 36-78) for tibial fractures. All fractures healed, but few had complications, such as infection (one case with tibial fracture) bent femoral nail with malunion (n = 1), and delayed union (n = 3; 2 cases in femur and 1 case in tibia). Mean time of union was 5.1 months (range, 4-10(1/2) months) for femoral fractures and 4.8 months (range, 3-9 months) for tibial fractures., CONCLUSION: We found the nail very easy to use with effective fixation in AO type A and B fractures in our setting. Less surgical time is required with minimum complications. The main advantage of the expandable nail is that if affords. satisfactory axial, rotatory, and bending stability with decreased radiation exposure to operating staff and the patient.",Excluded

Three groups were defined: 220 pseudophakic eyes, 3,182 noncataractous eyes (average LOCS III score, <1.5), and 134 cataractous eyes (average LOCS III score, >3.0)., RESULTS: Noncataractous straylight values increases strongly with age as: log(s) = constant + log(1 + (age / 65)(4)), doubling by the age of 65 years, and tripling by the age of 77 years. Population standard deviation around this age norm was approximately 0.10 log units. The cataract eyes (in this active driver group) had relatively mild straylight increase. In pseudophakia, straylight values may be very good, better even than in the noncataract group. Visual acuity and straylight were found to vary quite independently., CONCLUSIONS: Lens extraction holds promise not only to improve on the condition of the cataract eye, but also to improve on the age-normal eye. Lens extraction potentially reverses the strong age increase in straylight value, quite independently from visual acuity.",Excluded

1172,"Stereotactic body radiotherapy vs conventionally fractionated chemoradiation in locally advanced pancreatic cancer: A multicenter case-control study (PAULA-1) Conventionally fractionated chemoradiation (CRT) or chemotherapy (CHT) are considered as standard options in locally advanced pancreatic cancer (LAPC) while stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) is an emerging treatment in this setting. The aim of this study was to compare two cohorts of LAPC patients treated with SBRT +/- CHT vs CRT +/- CHT in terms of local control (LC), distant metastases-free survival (DMFS), progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS), and toxicity. Eighty patients were included. Patients in the two cohorts were matched according to: age <=/>65 years, tumor diameter (two cut-offs: =3.0 and =3.9 cm), clinical tumor stage and clinical nodal stage, neoadjuvant CHT, and adjuvant CHT. Median prescribed total dose was 30.0 Gy (range: 18.0-37.5) and 54.0 Gy (18.0-63.0) in SBRT and CRT cohorts, respectively. Toxicity was evaluated by CTCAE v4.0 scale. Survival curves were calculated by Kaplan-Meier method. For hypothesis testing an equivalence and a non-inferiority test was calculated. No statistically significant differences in terms of acute and late toxicity, DMFS, PFS, and OS were recorded among the two cohorts. Median, 1-, and 2-year LC was: 16.0 months, 53.1%, and 40.5% in the CRT cohort and 22.0 months, 80.4%, and 49.8% in the SBRT cohort, respectively (P:.017). A statistically non-inferiority significance was recorded in terms of OS between CRT and SBRT (P =.031). Patients treated with SBRT showed higher LC rate and similar OS compared to CRT. Therefore, the design of confirmatory randomized studies comparing SBRT and CRT seems justified.Copyright © 2020 The Authors. Cancer Medicine published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd",Excluded
305,"Management of intractable epistaxis in patients who received radiation therapy for nasopharyngeal carcinoma To report clinical manifestations, bleeding point localization, and outcomes of management in 16 patients with 16 instances of intractable epistaxis after radiation therapy for nasopharyngeal carcinoma. Retrospective chart review of 16 patients with nasopharyngeal carcinoma (mean age 52.06 +/- 14.37 years) with 16 instances of intractable epistaxis during the past 5 years, whose diagnosis was confirmed by angiography (n = 10) or MRI/CT imaging studies and clinical manifestations (n = 6). The mean radiation dose to the affected carotid artery was 101.37 +/- 34.85 Gy. Bleeding points were detected in the internal carotid artery (n = 8) or external carotid artery (n = 8). Detachable balloons were used in one affected artery for vascular occlusion; six were treated using an absorbable gelatin sponge (n = 4) or microcoils (diameter 1 mm) (n = 2). Endovascular embolization was successful in seven radiation carotid blowout syndromes with cessation of hemorrhage. One patient underwent external carotid artery ligation and one patient recovered without treatment. The clinical follow-up was 3 months. Therapeutic endovascular embolization of intractable epistaxis is both efficient and safe. It should be considered as the primary treatment modality in intractable epistaxis of nasopharyngeal carcinoma. © 2013 The Author(s).",Excluded
913,"Should adjuvant radiotherapy be recommended following resection of regional lymph node metastases of malignant melanomas? Background: Several authors have recommended adjuvant radiotherapy following resection of regional lymph node metastases in cutaneous malignant melanoma. There is, however, little evidence from controlled trials that patients benefit from this treatment. Objective(s): To evaluate the usefulness of adjuvant, radiotherapy following resection of lymph node metastases in cutaneous malignant melanoma. Method(s): We performed a retrospective study comparing 58 patients who underwent radiotherapy following resection of regional lymph node metastases with 58 controls from another centre who exclusively underwent regional lymphadenectomy. Patients and their controls were matched with respect to the number of tumour-bearing lymph nodes (1 vs. 1) and to gender, although the proportion of thick tumours was greater in the irradiation group. Result(s): The overall survival curves were almost identical in the two groups. There were nine disease recurrences in the study group and 12 in the control group (not significant). Regional recurrences in the irradiated patients were usually accompanied by metastases at other sites. Conclusion(s): The present study does not support the recommendation of adjuvant radiotherapy following resection of regional lymph node metastases in patients with malignant melanoma.",Included
1207,"Peritumoral inflammatory reaction in non-melanoma skin cancers - histological and immunohistochemical study Non-melanoma skin cancers (NMSCs) are the most frequent types of cancer in white skin populations, all over the world. In the last 40 years, there was observed a rapid increase of their incidence, because of the UV radiations exposure and weather changes. Although its morbidity is a relatively modest one, the direct social costs of NMSCs are quite substantial due to a high incidence. Due to these reasons, numerous studies try to clarify the etiopathogenic mechanisms of NMSCs, to elaborate treatment and prevention measures. In the last years, a special attention was given to the relation between inflammation and skin cancer. In our study, we performed a histological and immunohistological evaluation of the inflammatory reaction on a number of 73 surgical exeresis pieces coming from the patients diagnosed with NMSCs. Of these, 21 were squamous cell carcinomas (SCCs) and 52 basal cell carcinomas (BCCs). The peritumoral inflammatory reaction in NMSCs was an extremely variable one in intensity and distribution, from one case to another and even from one area to another within the same tumor, thus proving the complexity of the relations between tumor cells and the cells of the immune system. By comparing the intensity of the inflammatory reaction between the two main types of NMSCs, there was observed that in SCCs the inflammatory reaction was more intense in comparison to BCCs. Also, in SCC there was highlighted a more abundant inflammatory infiltrate in poorly differentiated carcinomas, in comparison to the well-differentiated ones. The presence of the immune system cells (T-lymphocytes, macrophages, mast cells) among the tumoral cells, in a direct contact with these, makes us believe that between the two categories of cells there may appear mechanisms of intercellular communication, distinct from the mechanisms of paracrine signaling.",Excluded
311,"The Impact of Hypoxia on Out-of-Field Cell Survival after Exposure to Modulated Radiation Fields Advanced radiotherapy techniques such as intensity modulated radiation therapy achieve highly conformal dose distributions within target tumor volumes through the sequential delivery of multiple spatially and temporally modulated radiation fields and have been shown to influence radiobiological response. The goals of this study were to determine the effect of hypoxia on the cell survival responses of different cell models (H460, DU145, A549, MDA231 and FADU) to modulated fields and to characterize the time dependency of signaling under oxic conditions, following reoxygenation and after prolonged hypoxia. Hypoxia was induced by incubating cells at 95% nitrogen and 5% carbon dioxide for 4 h prior to irradiation. The out-of-field response in MDA231 cells was oxygen dependent and therefore selected for co-culture studies to determine the signaling kinetics at different time intervals after irradiation under oxic and hypoxic conditions. Under both oxic and hypoxic conditions, significant increases in cell survival were observed in-field with significant decreases in survival observed out-of-field (P < 0.05), which were dependent on intercellular communication. The in-field response of MDA231 cells showed no significant time dependency up to 24 h postirradiation, while out-of-field survival decreased significantly during the first 6 h postirradiation (P < 0.05). While in-field responses were oxygen dependent, out-of-field effects were observed to be independent of oxygen, with similar or greater cell killing under hypoxic conditions. This study provides further understanding of intercellular signaling under hypoxic conditions and highlights the need for further refinement of established radiobiological models for future applications in advanced radiotherapies.",Excluded
512,"Symptomatic and quality of life changes after extrapleural pneumonectomy for malignant pleural mesothelioma Background: Extrapleural pneumonectomy for malignant pleural mesothelioma is considered an aggressive procedure, but symptomatic and quality of life changes are unknown. Method(s): Between 1997 and 2004, 16 consecutive patients underwent extrapleural pneumonectomy for mesothelioma followed by chemoradiotherapy. Tumor-related symptoms and quality of life (Short-Form-36 and St. George's questionnaires) were assessed pre, 3, 6, 12, and 24 months postoperatively. Result(s): Thirty-day postoperative major morbidity was 31% with no mortality. At 3 months postoperatively, dyspnea improved in 10 patients (62%), pain in 12 (75%), cough in 10 (62%), fever in 11 (68%), Karnofsky-index in 10 (62%), Short-Form-36 physical-component-summary in 8, mental-component- summary in 5 and total St. George score in 8 (50%). At 1 year 10 (62%) patients were alive and majority of improved parameters were still stable. Thereafter they usually started to decline. Survival was influenced by nonepithelial histology (P < 0.01) and N2-disease (P < 0.01), which showed to be the only prognosticator at Cox regression (P < 0.0001, Odd ratio 5.4). Among symptomatic variables, a 3-month postoperative Short-Form-36 physical-component-summary above the median value correlated significantly with a better prognosis (P < 0.02). Conclusion(s): Extrapleural pneumonectomy may rapidly improve symptoms as well as quality of life, especially in physical domains. Other than biological factors, postoperative Short-Form-36 physical component as well, significantly influenced the prognosis. © 2009 Wiley-Liss, Inc.",Excluded

980,"Expression of transforming growth factor-alpha, epidermal growth factor receptor and platelet-derived growth factors A and B in oropharyngeal cancers treated by curative radiation therapy Background and purpose: Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) has been implicated in cellular responses to ionizing radiation and represents a major target for current radiosensitizing strategies. We wished to ascertain whether a correlation existed between the expression of EGFR, transforming growth factor-alpha (TGFalpha) and platelet-derived growth factors A and B (PDGF-A and PDGF-B) and treatment outcome in a group of patients with oropharyngeal cancer who had undergone curative radiation therapy. We also assessed the relationship existing between each of the aforementioned proteins and intratumoral microvessel densities (IMD) which have been previously reported (Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys 2000;48:17-25. Material(s) and Method(s): Pretherapeutic tumor biopsies from 95 patients were immunohistochemically stained and their immunoreactivities evaluated semi-quantitatively. The statistical analyses included Cox regression for calculating risk ratios of survival endpoints and logistic regression for determining odds ratios for the development of distant metastasis. Result(s): Local tumor control as well as disease-free and overall survival were independent of protein expression levels, whereas combined TGFalpha and EGFR immunoreactivities were closely related to IMD (P=0.003). The expression levels of these two proteins were also correlated to each other (P=0.015). Expression of PDGF-B occurred in 54% of cases and was associated with an increase in the risk of developing distant metastasis (P=0.011). Conclusion(s): Tumoral levels of TGFalpha, EGFR and PDGF-A/B are not predictive of radioresponsiveness in oropharyngeal cancers. The association between IMD and immunoreactivity for TGFalpha and EGFR indicates the involvement of these proteins in the promotion of angiogenesis in these tumors. PDGF-B should be further evaluated as a prognostic marker for squamous cell cancer of the head and neck. © 2002 Elsevier Science Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.",Excluded

5,"Spatially fractionated GRID radiation treatment of advanced neck disease associated with head and neck cancer Advanced nodal disease associated with head and neck cancer warrants aggressive, often multi-modality therapy to maximize local-regional control. The expansion of a novel treatment paradigm developed by our institution includes the addition of a single-fraction of high dose spatially-fractionated radiation (GRID) to a conventional course of treatment. Between 1995 and 2002 a series of 27 patients (median age 65) with bulky N2-3 disease were treated. Median nodal tumor size was 7 cm. Two groups of patients were evaluated. Group 1 (N=14) patients received a median neck dose 69 Gy (range 54-79 Gy) plus GRID treatment. Group 2 (N=13) patients received a median neck dose of 59 Gy (range 54-72 Gy) plus GRID treatment followed by planned neck dissection. Patients were evaluated for local-regional control, pathological response, survival, and morbidity. Median time to follow-up for Group 1 was 10 months (range 3-44 months). Neck control was 93%. Disease specific survival was 50%. Morbidity was limited to soft-tissue related damage and was mild. Median time to follow-up for Group 2 was 38 months (range 5-116 months). Pathologic complete response rate was 85%. Overall neck control rate was 92%. Disease specific survival was 85%. Surgical morbidity was limited to three wound healing complications. GRID treatment may be safely added to conventional treatment management of locally advanced neck disease related to cancer with acceptable morbidity. It may improve pathologic complete response rates in those patients who undergo planned neck dissection, possibly leading to improved survival. In patients with inoperable bulky disease, addition of GRID enhances local-regional control.",Excluded

769,"Polyethyleneimine grafted with pluronic P85 enhances Ku86 antisense delivery and the ionizing radiation treatment efficacy in vivo In an effort to improve the efficacy of antisense delivery, we evaluated polyethyleneimine (PEI, 2 kDa) alone or grafted with nonionic amphiphilic block copolymer Pluronic (P85) as a carrier for Ku86 antisense oligonucleotide (ASO) delivery. Ku86 is an abundant nuclear protein that plays an important role in nonhomologous DNA end joining and has implications in tumorigenesis and acquired drug resistance. Transfection of adherent and suspension cell lines with Ku86 ASOs complexed with P85-g-PEI (2 kDa) conjugates was associated with a specific decrease in Ku86 mRNA levels (EC50<75 nM and EC50<250 nM, respectively, n=3). More importantly, no requirement for reduced serum conditions was necessary during transfection. In contrast, whereas Ku86 ASOs complexed with PEI (2 kDa) alone were effective in decreasing Ku86 mRNA levels in adherent cell lines (EC50<75 nM, n=3), the formulation did not produce any detectable decrease in Ku86 mRNA levels in suspension cell lines. Transfection of adherent cell lines with 500 nM Ku86 ASOs formulated with P85-g-PEI (2 kDa) was associated with a specific decrease (<10% remaining of control) in Ku86 protein expression and a two-fold increased cell death after treatment with ionizing radiation (IR). In athymic nude mice bearing subcutaneous human HT29 colon adenocarcinoma xenografts, Ku86 ASO-P85-g-PEI (2 kDa) administration (15 mg/kg, subcutaneously) with a Q1D x 7 treatment schedule, when combined with a single dose of IR (6 Gy), caused a significant inhibition of HT29 tumor growth compared with mismatch- and naked antisense-pretreated control groups (time from 200 to 1000 mm3, 126.9 versus 84.18 and 87.76 days, P<0.005). A potentiation of the antitumor activity was observed in all mice treated with Ku86 ASO-P85-g-PEI (2 kDa) formulation; however, tumor growth inhibition was reversible upon treatment cessation. No morbidity/mortality or changes in histopathology were observed under this treatment regiment. Our results indicate that P85-g-PEI (2 kDa) conjugates may increase the efficacy of Ku86 ASO delivery in management of resistant malignancies, thus providing a rationale for their evaluation in cancer patients in combination with conventional anticancer therapies.",Excluded
529,"High-frequency jet ventilation under general anesthesia facilitates CT-guided lung tumor thermal ablation compared with normal respiration under conscious analgesic sedation PURPOSE: To determine whether technical difficulty of computed tomography (CT)-guided percutaneous lung tumor thermal ablations is altered with the use of high-frequency jet ventilation (HFJV) under general anesthesia (GA) compared with procedures performed with normal respiration (NR) under conscious sedation (CS)., MATERIALS AND METHODS: Thermal ablation treatment sessions performed with NR under CS or HFJV under GA with available anesthesia records and CT fluoroscopic images were retrospectively reviewed; 13 and 33 treatment sessions, respectively, were identified. One anesthesiologist determined the choice of anesthesiologic technique independently. Surrogate measures of procedure technical difficulty--time duration, number of CT fluoroscopic acquisitions, and radiation dose required for applicator placement for each tumor--were compared between anesthesiologic techniques. The anesthesiologist time and complications were also compared. Parametric and nonparametric data were compared by Student independent-samples t test and chi(2) test, respectively., RESULTS: Patients treated with HFJV under GA had higher American Society of Anesthesiologists classifications (mean, 2.66 vs 2.23; P = .009) and smaller lung tumors (16.09 mm vs 27.38 mm; P = .001). The time duration (220.30 s vs 393.94 s; P = .008), number of CT fluoroscopic acquisitions (10.31 vs 19.13; P = .023), and radiation dose (60.22 mGy.cm vs 127.68 mGy.cm; P = .012) required for applicator placement were significantly lower in treatment sessions performed with HFJV under GA. There was no significant differences in anesthesiologist time (P = .20), rate of pneumothorax (P = .62), or number of pneumothoraces requiring active treatment (P = .19)., CONCLUSIONS: HFJV under GA appears to reduce technical difficulty of CT-guided percutaneous applicator placement for lung tumor thermal ablations, with similar complication rates compared with treatment sessions performed with NR under CS. The technique is safe and may facilitate treatment of technically challenging tumors. Copyright © 2014 SIR. Published by Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.",Excluded
137,"Is There a Role for Radiotherapy in the Primary Management of Primary Central Nervous System Lymphoma? A Single-centre Case Series Aims: In recent years, the optimum primary management of primary central nervous system lymphoma (PCNSL) has evolved from combined modality chemoradiotherapy to chemotherapy alone. We describe a single-centre case series of PCNSL with a view to assessing the role of radiotherapy in primary disease management. Material(s) and Method(s): West of Scotland PCNSL cases between 2001 and 2010 were identified by neuropathology. Observational data were collected retrospectively from case notes and electronic systems. Result(s): Forty-nine patients fulfilled the eligibility criteria. The median age was 61 years. Chemotherapy with a view to consolidation radiotherapy on completion was delivered to 61% (. n=30). Regimens varied, but were generally methotrexate-based. Chemotherapy was discontinued prematurely in 80% (. n=24) due to progressive disease (. n=12), intolerable toxicity (. n=7) or death (. n=4). In all patients who progressed or did not tolerate chemotherapy, treatment was changed to immediate salvage radiotherapy; modal irradiation was 40Gy. Radiotherapy alone was delivered to those not suitable for chemotherapy (18%, n=9) and best supportive care to those with poor performance status (18%, n=9). The overall median survival was 8 months. In those receiving single modality radiotherapy or chemotherapy, the median survival was 5 and 8 months, respectively. For those completing chemoradiotherapy in its entirety, 3 year survival was 100%; in groups receiving salvage radiotherapy despite progressive disease or chemotherapy toxicity, moderate survival was maintained with immediate radiotherapy with 3 year survival rates of 33 and 60%, respectively. Conclusion(s): Although chemotherapy alone remains the optimal treatment of PCNSL, out with clinical trials only a minority of patients complete chemotherapy due to toxicity and disease progression; in such patients, immediate salvage radiotherapy provides an effective and safe alternative with maintenance of good outcomes. © 2013 The Royal College of Radiologists.",Excluded

Most minimal access procedures have been performed via a midline approach. Based on our experience of more than 500 endoscopic parathyroidectomies via a lateral approach we have used the same method for thyroid lobectomy., METHODS: We present our experience of endoscopic thyroid lobectomy via a lateral approach (ETLA) and review of the results over a 1-year period (2004). Inclusion criteria for ETLA were (1) solitary nodule with atypical/suspicious fine-needle biopsy (FNB) or solitary toxic nodule; (2) lesions with a diameter of < 3 cm. Patients with a history of previous neck surgery or radiation exposure were excluded. All patients underwent postoperative vocal cord checks and plasma calcium evaluation., RESULTS: A total of 742 thyroid procedures were performed during 2004. Among them, 38 patients (5.1%) underwent ETLA. Indications for surgery were suspicious FNB results (36 patients) and a toxic nodule (2 patients). Mean nodule size was 19.2 mm. Mean +/- SD operating time was 102 +/- 27 minutes. All recurrent laryngeal nerves were identified (including one that was nonrecurrent). Of the 38 patients, the superior parathyroid gland was identified in 36 and the inferior parathyroid gland in 33. There were two conversions due to difficulty with the dissection. Two operations were converted because malignancy was diagnosed on frozen section examination. Two patients underwent a delayed completion thyroidectomy when definitive histology necessitated it. There were no permanent operative complications, and all patients were discharged on the first postoperative day., CONCLUSIONS: ETLA offers excellent intraoperative visualization of the vital structures and is a safe alternative to conventional thyroid lobectomy in selected cases.",Excluded
76,"Instrument for near infrared emission spectroscopic probing of human fingertips in vivo We present instrumentation for probing of volar side fingertip capillary beds with free space coupled near infrared light while collecting Raman, Rayleigh, and Mie scattered light as well as fluorescence. Fingertip skin capillary beds are highly vascularized relative to other tissues and present a desirable target for noninvasive probing of blood. But human hands and fingers in particular are also highly idiosyncratic body parts requiring specific apparatus to allow careful and methodical spectroscopic probing. The apparatus includes means for precise and reproducible placement of the tissues relative to the optical aperture. Appropriate means are provided for applying and maintaining pressure to keep surface tissues immobile during experiments while obtaining the desired blood content and flow. Soft matter, e.g., skin, extrudes into the aperture in response to any applied pressure, e.g., to keep the tissue in registration with the optical system, so the position, contact area, pressure, and force are continuously measured and recorded to produce feedback for an actuator applying force and to discern the compliance of the test subject. The compliance strongly affects the reliability of the measurement and human factors must be adequately managed in the case of in vivo probing. The apparatus produces reproducible observations and measurements that allow consistent probing of the tissues of a wide range of skin types.",Excluded
93,"Cervical lymphatic metastases from occult primary tumor. A nation-wide 20-year study from the Danish society of head and neck oncology INTRODUCTION: The management of patients with cervical lymph node metastases from unknown primary tumours is a major challenge in oncology. This study presents data collected from all five oncology centres in Denmark. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Of the 352 consecutive patients with squamous cell or undifferentiated tumours seen from 1975 to 1995, a total of 277 (79%) were treated with radical intent. Most patients received radiotherapy to both sides of the neck as well as elective irradiation of the mucosal sites in nasopharynx, oropharynx, hypopharynx and larynx (81%). Irradiation of the ipsilateral neck only was done in 26 patients (10%). Radical surgery was the only treatment in 23 N1-N2 patients (9%). RESULT(S): The five-year estimates of neck control, disease-specific survival and overall survival for radically treated patients were 51%, 48% and 36%, respectively. The emergence of the occult primary was observed in 66 patients (19%). About half of the emerging primaries were within the head and neck region with oropharynx, hypopharynx and oral cavity being the most common sites. Emerging primaries outside the head and neck region were primarily located in the lung (19 patients) and oesophagus (five patients). The most important factor for neck control was nodal stage (5-year estimates 69% [N1], 58% [N2] and 30% [N3]). Other important parameters for neck control and disease-specific survival included haemoglobin, gender and overall treatment time. Patients treated with ipsilateral radiotherapy had a relative risk of recurrence in the head and neck region of 1.9 compared to patients treated at both neck and mucosa. At five years, the estimated control rates were 27% (ipsilateral) and 51% (bilateral; p = 0.05). The 5-year disease-specific survival estimates were 28% and 45%, respectively (p = 0.10). DISCUSSION: Extensive irradiation to both sides of the neck and the mucosa in the entire pharyngeal axis and larynx resulted in significantly fewer loco-regional failures compared to patients treated with ipsilateral techniques, but only a trend towards better survival. Determination of the optimal strategy in terms of loco-regional control, survival and morbidity requires a prospective randomized trial.",Excluded
30,"Evaluation of a transparent perfluorodecalin-infused patch as an adjunct to laser-assisted tattoo removal: A pivotal trial BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Laser-assisted treatment of tattoos is well recognized to produce opaque epidermal whitening that prevents multiple sequential passes during a single treatment session. The amount of epidermal whitening produced in association with the procedure can be minimized by topical application of perfluorodecalin (PFD), which is an optical clearing agent. This pivotal trial assessed the ability of a transparent PFD-infused patch used in conjunction with a Q-switched nanosecond laser in the treatment of tattoos to permit multiple laser passes during a single 5 minute treatment session in comparison to the number of passes that could be completed using conventional treatment of the tattoo with the laser alone., STUDY DESIGN: Thirty subjects (mean age 37 years; 14 males) with predominantly dark blue or black tattoos were enrolled in a split-tattoo trial. One half of each tattoo was treated conventionally, whereas the other half was treated through the PFD patch. Treatments were performed using a nanosecond Q-switched 755-nm Alexandrite laser. The number of treatments performed in a 5-minute time period was quantified for each side of the tattoo (primary effectiveness outcome). Patient-reported pain scores and adverse events (AEs) were also evaluated., RESULTS: Significantly more laser passes could be made on average using the PFD patch compared with treatment using the laser alone (3.7 passes vs. 1.4 passes; P < 0.001). AEs were limited to those expected during laser removal of tattoos. The proportions of subjects with transient edema and erythema were lower in the PFD patch treatment group (36.7% vs. 63.3% and 33.3% vs. 70.0%, respectively); all AEs were transient and resolved quickly. No patient in either group exhibited dyschromia (hypo- or hyperpigmentation) in the treatment area at the 1-month post treatment visit. Additionally, when surveyed at the 1-month follow-up visit, all subjects (30/30) preferred to continue laser-assisted tattoo removal with the PFD patch., CONCLUSION: An average of 3.7 laser passes were made in a defined 5-minute treatment session when using the transparent PFD-infused patch, which is significantly more than was possible with the laser alone (average of 1.4 passes). Use of the PFD patch was associated with improved tolerability compared with conventional treatment, with subjects experiencing fewer and less severe AEs related to epidermal injury. Lasers Surg.

384,"CyberKnife stereotactic radiosurgery for recurrent, metastatic, and residual hemangiopericytomas Objective. Hemangiopericytoma is a rare and aggressive meningeal tumor. Although surgical resection is the standard treatment, hemangiopericytomas often recur with high incidences of metastasis. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the role of CyberKnife stereotactic radiosurgery (CK) in the management of recurrent, metastatic, and residual hemangiopericytomas. Methods. In a review of the Stanford radiosurgery database between 2002 and 2009, the authors found 14 patients who underwent CK therapy for recurrent, metastatic, and residual hemangiopericytomas. A total of 24 tumors were treated and the median patient age was 52 years (range 29-70 years) at the time of initial CK therapy. The median follow-up period was 37 months (10-73 months) and all patients had been previously treated with surgical resection. Mean tumor volume was 9.16 cm3 and the mean marginal and maximum radiosurgical doses to the tumors were 21.2 Gy and 26.8 Gy, respectively. Result(s): Of the 24 tumors treated, 22 have clinical follow-up data at this time. Of those 22 tumors, 12 decreased in size (54.5%), 6 remained unchanged (27.3%), and 4 showed recurrence (18.2%) after CK therapy. Progression-free survival rate was 95%, 71.5%, and 71.5% at 1, 3, and 5 years after multiple CK treatments. The 5-year survival rate after CK was 81%. Conclusion(s): CK is an effective and safe management option for hemangiopericytomas. The current series demonstrates a tumor control of 81.8%. Other institutions have demonstrated similar outcomes with stereotactic radiosurgery, with tumor control ranging from 46.4% to 100%. © 2011 Veeravagu et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",Excluded
0,Efficacy of radiation therapy for the treatment of macroscopic canine oral soft tissue sarcoma This retrospective study evaluated the efficacy of radiotherapy used alone in macroscopic oral soft tissue sarcoma. Thirty-one dogs qualified for the study. Twenty dogs received curative radiotherapy (median total dose: 52.5 Gy) and eleven dogs were treated palliatively (3 x 8 Gy or 5 x 6 Gy). The time-to-progression for the curatively-treated dogs was 333 days versus 180 days for the palliatively-treated dogs (p=0.134). The overall survival was 331 days for the curative group and 310 days for the palliative group (p=0.2292). The results of this study suggest that radiation therapy is useful in the treatment of oral soft tissue sarcoma.,Excluded
997,"Chromosomal instability in offspring of voles in unfavorable radiation zones A high frequency of cells having chromosomal aberrations was shown to be preserved in the first generation of laboratory offspring of common voles, whose ancestors were captured near the East Ural radioactive track (EURT). In F2 and F3, a decrease in frequency was observed. Most likely, the cytogenetic effects observed were caused by environmental contamination with plutonium in the locality of capture. An increased chromosomal instability observed in the first laboratory generation of nonirradiated common voles was caused by reversible modifications in the expression of mutator genes inherited from parents exposed to alpha-irradiation rather than by classic mutations occurred in specific loci.",Included
144,"Endoscopic esophageal reconstruction for the treatment of a total and extensive disruption of the esophagus using a ''rendez-vous'' technique INTRODUCTION: Complete esophageal obstruction leads to definitive fasting. The rendez-vous endoscopic approach had already been described for complex stenoses as an alternative to surgery that has high morbid-mortality. AIMS & METHODS: This is a case series report about six patients referred for complete esophageal disruption classified in two groups: 1/ Long disruption (> 5cm), one after caustic ingestion and two due to an esophageal stripping during SEMS removal. Two had an associated loss of the SES; 2/ Short disruption (< 5cm), consecutive to radiation therapy for a neck neoplasia. They had been fasting for 3 to 18 months. All the procedures were performed according the anterograde retrograde approach, under anesthesia and with CO2 insufflation and X-rays guidance. RESULT(S): There were 3 men and women between 25 and 71 years old. All the reconstructions have been successful in one to three endoscopic sessions, using the non hydrophilic tip of a guide wire passed through a straight catheter in 5 cases and a EUS needle in only one case. In 2 cases, a neo-SES had to be created, by transillumination (n=1) or head and neck surgery (n=1). In order to guide the reconstruction, SEMS was used in one case, NGT in one case, and both were used in one patient. The first dilation was performed with a CRE balloon (12-15mm). All the patients could eat mixed after 2 POD. There was no intraoperative or post-operative complication. Then, the patients underwent 3 to 18 dilations sessions during 1.5 to 15 months; two are still undergoing dilations and all eat normally. CONCLUSION(S): Endoscopic rendez-vous for esophageal reconstruction is safe and effective in case of esophageal disruption even with loss of SES, avoiding surgery.",Excluded
629,"Linear accelerator-based stereotactic radiosurgery for limited, locally persistent, and recurrent nasopharyngeal carcinoma: efficacy and complications PURPOSE: To evaluate the efficacy and complication of linear accelerator-based stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) when used as salvage treatment for early-stage persistent and recurrent nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) after primary radiotherapy (RT)., MATERIALS AND METHODS: Between March 1998 and June 2001, 18 patients (15 men and 3 women; median age 46 years, range 32-84) with locally persistent or recurrent NPC confined to the nasopharynx (rT1) or with limited extension to the nasal fossa or parapharyngeal space (rT2) were treated by SRS. Thirteen patients had rT1 disease and 5 had rT2 disease. Most patients had disease not amenable to surgery or brachytherapy. All patients had undergone previous radical RT. Persistent disease was defined as tumor relapse within 4 months of completion of primary RT, and recurrence as tumor relapse beyond 4 months. Seven patients were treated for persistent disease, eight for a first recurrence, and three for a second recurrence. SRS was performed using multiple noncoplanar arcs of photons delivered to the target volume, which was defined by axial CT at a 3 mm thickness, supplemented by MRI in selected patients (67%). The median target volume was 5.3 cm(3) (range 2.2-16.9). The median SRS dose was 12.5 Gy (range 11-14) delivered to the 80% isodose line. All patients underwent serial nasopharyngoscopy and imaging after SRS. The median follow-up was 26 months (range 11-48)., RESULTS: After SRS, 16 (89%) of 18 patients had complete regression of tumor as assessed by nasopharyngoscopy and biopsy. Four patients with an initial complete response to SRS subsequently developed local relapse again, with one recurrence developing outside the target volume 8 months after SRS and three within the target volume at 6-26 months after SRS. Two patients with local disease controlled by SRS developed relapse in other sites (neck node and liver metastases). The actuarial 2-year local control rate after SRS was 72%. Patients treated for persistent disease had a better local control rate (100%; 7 of 7) than those treated for recurrent disease (46%; 5 of 11). Patients with rT1 disease also had a better outcome after SRS compared with those with rT2 disease, with a control rate of 77% (10 of 13) for rT1 disease and 40% (2 of 5) for rT2 disease. Treatments were well tolerated, with no acute side effects. One patient had radiologic evidence of temporal lobe necrosis, although the right temporal lobe had already received a high dose during prior RT. That patient also developed additional local recurrence and liver metastases and died. The actuarial 2-year survival rate was 86%., CONCLUSIONS: Our preliminary results indicate that SRS is an effective treatment modality for persistent and recurrent early-stage NPC, with early control rates comparable to other salvage treatments such as brachytherapy and nasopharyngectomy. A modest SRS dose at 12.5 Gy also appears to be effective and is associated with minimal morbidities. More clinical experience and longer follow-up are needed to validate our results and to address fully the role of SRS in salvaging local failures of NPC.",Excluded
195,"A system for in vivo measurement of bone calcium by local neutron activation of the hand A 252Cf neutron-irradiation facility designed specifically for clinical in vivo measurement of calcium in the hand is described. Results of preliminary measurements are presented. Hand phantoms were exposed to the neutron beam for 10 min and the induced 49Ca activities were counted for 10 min after an elapsed time of 2 min. The results indicate that with a 2 X 100 micrograms 252Cf neutron source and two 20.3 X 12.7 cm NaI crystals, the counts per gram of bone mineral mass changes by about 4% for each 100 cm3 change in the overall volume (soft tissue plus bone) of the hand. For hands of equal volumes the counts per gram are expected to be almost independent of the bone volume. With an absorbed dose equivalent of 150 mSv (15 rem), the sensitivity is about 200 counts per 10 min per gram Ca. The statistical reproducibility of the results is better than 3% for the average value of 11 g Ca in the normal hand.",Excluded
589,"Effect of selenium supplementation for protection of salivary glands from iodine-131 radiation damage in patients with differentiated thyroid cancer OBJECTIVE: In the current study, we examined whether selenium supplementation during iodine-131 (131I) treatment had a radio-protective effect on salivary glands., SUBJECTS AND METHODS: Sixteen patients with differentiated thyroid cancer were prospectively enrolled in the study. Patients after total thyroidectomy, before 131I treatment, were divided into two groups; 8 patients in the selenium group and 8 patients in the control group. Patients in the selenium group received 300nug of selenium orally for 10 days, from 3 days before to 6 days after 131I treatment. The control group received a placebo over the same period. To assess salivary gland function, salivary gland scintigraphy was performed before and 6 months after 131I treatment. Serum amylase and whole blood selenium levels were measured before and 2 days and 6 months after 131I treatment. Using salivary gland scintigraphy, maximum uptake ratio (MUR), maximum secretion percentage (MSP), and ejection fraction (EF) of each salivary gland were calculated., RESULTS: Baseline clinical characteristics, baseline amylase and selenium levels, and parameters of baseline salivary gland scintigraphy were not significantly different between selenium and control groups (P>0.05). On a blood test performed 2 days after 131I treatment, the selenium group showed a significantly higher whole blood selenium level (P=0.008) and significantly lower serum amylase level (P=0.009) than the control group. On follow-up salivary gland scintigraphy, the control group showed significantly decreased, MUR of the bilateral parotid and left submandibular glands, MSP of the bilateral parotid and submandibular glands, and EF of the left submandibular glands (P<0.05), while the selenium group only had a significant decrease in MSP of the right submandibular gland and EF of the left submandibular gland (P<0.05)., CONCLUSION: Selenium supplementation during 131I treatment was effective to reduce salivary glands damage by 131I radiation in patients with differentiated thyroid cancer.",Excluded
348,"Analysis of biologically equivalent dose of stereotactic body radiotherapy for primary and metastatic lung tumors Purpose: The purpose of this study was to determine the optimal biologically equivalent dose (BED) for stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) by comparing local control rates in proportion to various total doses and fractionation schedules. Material(s) and Method(s): Thirty-four patients with early non-small-cell lung cancer and a single metastatic lung tumor were included in this study. Differences in local control rates were evaluated according to gender, primary tumor site, response, tumor size, and BED. For comparison of BEDs, the prescribed dose for SBRT was stratified according to three groups: high (BED > 146 Gy), medium to high (BED, 106 to 146 Gy), and low to medium (BED < 106 Gy). Result(s): For all patients, the overall local control rate was 85.3% at two years after treatment. Five local recurrences were observed, and, notably, all of them were observed in the low to medium BED group. Significantly higher local control rates were observed for patients with a complete response than for those with a partial response or stable disease (p < 0.001). Twenty-six patients with a tumor size of < 3 cm showed no dose-response relationship in the low to medium, medium to high, and high BED groups, whereas eight patients with a tumor size of = 3 cm showed a significant dose-response relationship. The observed 2-year local recurrence-free survival rates in patients with a tumor size of < 3 cm and in those with a tumor size of = 3 cm were 96.2% and 50.0%, respectively, which were significantly different (p=0.007). Conclusion(s): BED > 100 Gy is required in order to achieve a > 85% local control rate regardless of tumor size. The optimal dose for small tumors of < 3 cm appears to be within a range below 150 Gy BED. Escalation of BED to high levels (> 150 Gy) may be required for patients with a tumor size larger than 3 cm.Copyright © 2014 by the Korean Cancer Association.",Excluded
332,"Urinary ET-1 excretion after exposure to radio-contrast media in diabetic patients and patients with preexisting mild impaired renal function Aims Contrast media-induced nephropathy (CIN) is associated with increased morbidity and mortality. The renal endothelin system has been associated with disease progression of various acute and chronic renal diseases. However, robust data coming from adequately powered prospective clinical studies analyzing the short and long-term impacts of the renal ET system in patients with CIN are missing so far. We thus performed a prospective study addressing this topic. Main methods We included 327 patients with diabetes or renal impairment undergoing coronary angiography. Blood and spot urine were collected before and 24 h after contrast media (CM) application. Patients were followed for 90 days for major clinical events like need for dialysis, unplanned rehospitalization or death. Key findings The concentration of ET-1 and the urinary ET-1/creatinine ratio decreased in spot urine after CM application (ET-1 concentration: 0.91 +/- 1.23 pg/ml versus 0.63 +/- 1.03 pg/ml, p < 0.001; ET-1/creatinine ratio: 0.14 +/- 0.23 versus 0.09 +/- 0.19, p < 0.001). The urinary ET-1 concentrations in patients with CIN decreased significantly more than in patients without CIN (- 0.26 +/- 1.42 pg/ml vs. - 0.79 +/- 1.69 pg/ml, p = 0.041), whereas the decrease of the urinary ET-1/creatinine ratio was not significantly different (non-CIN patients: - 0.05 +/- 0.30; CIN patients: - 0.11 +/- 0.21, p = 0.223). Urinary ET-1 concentrations as well as the urinary ET-1/creatinine ratio were not associated with clinical events (need for dialysis, rehospitalization or death) during the 90 day follow-up after contrast media exposure. However, the urinary ET-1 concentration and the urinary ET-1/creatinine ratio after CM application were higher in those patients who had a decrease of GFR of at least 25% after 90 days of follow-up. Significance In general the ET-1 system in the kidney seems to be down-regulated after contrast media application in patients with moderate CIN risk. Major long-term complications of CIN (need for dialysis, rehospitalization or death) are not associated with the renal ET system.Copyright © 2014 The Authors",Excluded

Its prognosis is extremely poor, and many reports described that complete resection of the tumor showed better locoregional control. We urgently performed radical resection in two patients with locoregionally advanced ATC within 10 days after the first visit. Case 1: A 63-year-old man presented with a rapidly growing thyroid mass that had been noticed one month earlier. The cytologic examination performed at the previous clinic showed ATC. He was referred to our hospital for treatment of the disease. Ten days after the first visit, a total thyroidectomy combined with total laryngectomy and bilateral neck dissection was performed. He has been alive for 27 months with no evidence of disease. Case 2: A 66-year-old woman suffered from right neck pain, and had noticed a rapidly growing thyroid mass one month earlier. At the previous clinic, her thyroid mass was diagnosed as ATC by cytologic examination. Seven days after visiting our hospital, a total thyroidectomy in conjunction with total laryngopharyngoesophagectomy and bilateral neck dissection was performed, and her gullet was reconstructed with a free jejunum. She received 54 Gy of irradiation postoperatively. However, multiple metastases developed 4 months later, and she died 5 months after the operation without local recurrence. For ATC, radical complete dissection for locoregional control should be performed as soon as possible due to the possibility of cure and airway management.",Excluded
18,"Clinical usefulness of the novel tag-less Pillcam patency capsule for the screening of patients with suspected small bowel strictures BACKGROUND:Capsule endoscopy (CE) is a non-invasive diagnostic tool for the study of the small bowel. The main complication of CE is capsule retention, defined as a failure to excrete the capsule for 2 weeks or more requiring directed medical, endoscopic, or surgical intervention. Due to the risk of capsule retention, CE is contraindicated in patients with suspected small bowel strictures. The novel tag-less PillCam Patency Capsule (PPC) for preventing capsule retention which was marketed in 2012 in Japan has expanded the indication of small bowel disease for CE. OBJECTIVE(S):We investigated the safety and clinical usefulness of the novel tag-less PillCam Patency Capsule for preventing capsule retention in patients with suspected small bowel strictures. PATIENTS AND METHODS:Sixteen patients who suspected small bowel strictures were included (mean age: 66.2) in this retrospective study. If patients had already excreted the intact PPC in the stool at 30 h after ingestion of PPC, patency of the small bowel was confirmed. If the confirmation at 30 h was not successful, reconfirmation was performed by abdominal X-ray and/or computed tomography (CT) within 33 hours after the ingestion. If the intact PPC had reached to colon, we judged patency"". Except for the above-mentioned, we judged ""no patency"". If patency was established, then the patients underwent CE. RESULT(S):Male/Female (8/8). Clinical indications before the PPC were melena or hematochezia (6), abdominal pain (3), abdominal distension (2), abdominal mass (4) constipation (1), diarrhea (1), anemia (2), no abdominal symptom (4). A history of abdominal surgery +/- (4/12). A history of abdominal irradiation +/- (5/11). Fourteen cases (87.5%) had complete PPC examination followed by CE within 2 weeks. We judged 2 cases ""no patency"". Each of two cases showed the symptoms of ileus. One case needed ileus tube insertion and gastrografin enema showed stricture. In another case, gastric tube was inserted. In both cases, the ileus improved after conservative treatment. Fourteen patients underwent CE following the patency capsule examination. In 10 cases (71.4%) of them, the significant pathologic findings were found by CE. Although the confirmation of the patency by PPC was established, retention occurred in one case with asymptomatic. The patient had prior operation history of ileum-transverse colon bypass. CONCLUSION(S):Passage is a direct proof of the patency of small bowel. The tag-less PillCam Patency Capsule was useful to evaluate the patency of the small bowel to confirm the safer capsule endoscopy in patients with suspected small bowel strictures. However, the PPC itself may show the symptoms of ileus. The cases with abdominal surgical history could be a risk for capsule retention even though PillCam Patency Capsule confirmed the patency.""",Excluded
94,"Prospective versus retrospective ECG-gated 64-detector coronary CT angiography for evaluation of coronary artery bypass graft patency: Comparison of image quality, radiation dose and diagnostic accuracy We aimed to evaluate image quality, radiation dose and diagnostic accuracy of coronary CT angiography (CCTA) with a prospectively gated transverse-axial scan (PGT) compared with a retrospectively gated helical scan (RGH), using a 64-slice scanner in patients who underwent coronary artery bypass graft (CABG). Of the 131 consecutive patients that underwent CABG using 64-slice multidetector row computed tomography during 2008, patients with heart rate (HR) of<75 beats/minute (bpm), and HR variation<10 bpm were included in the study. PGT was performed on 39 patients with 93 grafts, with RGH performed on 43 patients with 102 grafts. Image quality (1: excellent-4: poor) and estimated radiation dose were compared between the two groups. Of these, a total of 64 segments in 26 patients were subjected to invasive coronary angiography (ICA) for clinical reasons. Diagnostic accuracy of CCTA for evaluation of graft was performed between the two groups with ICA as a reference standard in terms of significant stenosis (C 50% of luminal stenosis). The image quality was not statistically different in the two groups. Mean effective radiation dose was 6.5 mSv in PGTgroup, which was significantly lower than that in the RGH-group (21.2 mSv; P<0.001). There was no statistically significant difference in diagnostic accuracy between the two groups (PGT-group versus RGHgroup; 93.1% versus 91.4%).

Diagnostic accuracy was calculated for CTCA, calcium scoring, and for the combination of both. Receiver operator characteristic analyses were performed to determine cutoffs for prediction of significant coronary artery stenoses., RESULTS: Mean effective radiation dose was 2.1 + or - 0.7 mSv (range, 1.0-3.3 mSv) for CTCA and 1.1 + or - 0.1 mSv (range, 0.9-1.4 mSv) for calcium scoring. Per-patient sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value were 100%, 85.7%, 89.2%, and 100% for CTCA, and 72.7%, 82.1%, 82.8%, and 71.9% for calcium scoring. Adding calcium-scoring with a cutoff at 133 in patients aged >50.7 years with nondiagnostic CTCA improved the respective values of diagnostic accuracy of the entire study population to 100%, 96.4%, 97.1%, and 100%; the added value of calcium scoring was confined to only three patients (5%), who were reclassified from false positive to true negative., CONCLUSION: Specificity and PPV of low-dose CTCA may be further improved by combining it with coronary calcium scoring. However, only a fraction of patient may benefit, whereas exposing the entire population to more than 50% increase in effective radiation dose. Copyright 2010 AUR. Published by Elsevier Inc.

1232,"Biodosimetry for high dose accidental exposures by drug induced premature chromosome condensation (PCC) assay The conventional dicentric assay does not provide an accurate dose estimate in the case of accidental exposure to ionizing radiation above 6 Gy due to mitotic delay and poor mitotic index. The present study aims to establish a simple and rapid dose assessment technique based on scoring of rings and fragments in PCC spreads of stimulated lymphocytes. Human peripheral blood lymphocytes were gamma irradiated to different doses (6.2-24.5 Gy), cultured for two days with PHA and were forced to condense prematurely using 500 nM Okadaic acid (OA). The chromosome spreads were prepared, stained with Giemsa and observed under a microscope. The PCC index, PCC rings, and PCC fragments were scored for each dose point to arrive at the dose effect curve for various end points such as induction of rings and fragments and dicentrics. The PCC index varied from 12-18% up to 18 Gy and thereafter dropped to 6-8% at higher doses. The dose dependent increase in rings and fragments was found to be linear with a slope of 0.054+/-0.001 Gy(-1) for rings and 0.45+/-0.03 Gy(-1) for PCC fragments. An experiment was carried out to simulate partial-body exposure by mixing 10 Gy in vitro irradiated blood with un-irradiated blood in different proportions. The ratio of frequency of damaged cells among the total number of cells analyzed was found to be a good index of partial-body exposure. The culture duration was extended to 72 h to overcome the cell cycle delay induced by high doses of radiation. The conventional dicentrics rings and fragments also showed a dose response at high doses. The response can be best fitted to a linear model with a slope of 0.28+/-0.0007 Gy(-1) for the induction of dicentrics. However, long culture duration, technical skill and time required to analyse multi-aberrant cells makes the dicentric assay less suitable for high dose exposures requiring a rapid dose estimate. The PCC assay can be performed in 50 h with biodosimetric information about the irradiated fraction in cases of acute radiation exposures. The automated finding of PCC spreads significantly increased the speed of scoring PCC fragments. Copyright 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",Excluded
453,"Utility of postoperative radiographs for cervical spine fusion: A comprehensive evaluation of operative technique, surgical indication, and duration since surgery STUDY DESIGN.: A retrospective study. OBJECTIVE.: To assess the utility of postoperative radiographs in patients across a spectrum of cervical fusion procedures, surgical indication, and time since surgery. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA.: Postoperative radiographs are routinely obtained after cervical spine fusion despite lack of evidence supporting such practice. Studies assessing postoperative radiographical utility in the cervical spine have been limited. To date, no study has comprehensively evaluated the utility of obtaining such radiographs across multiple cervical fusion procedures. METHODS.: A total of 972 clinic notes from 301 patients during a 10-year period at a single institution were retrospectively reviewed. Patients in this study underwent an anterior cervical discectomy and fusion, anterior corpectomy and fusion, a combined anterior cervical discectomy and fusion and anterior corpectomy and fusion (hybrid), posterior spine fusion, or 360degree fusion. All postoperative clinic notes and radiographs were reviewed for abnormalities and changes in treatment course. It was determined whether an abnormal radiograph alone led to a change in treatment course among the various operative techniques, surgical indication, or time since surgery. RESULTS.: No statistical significant difference in radiograph utility between anterior cervical discectomy and fusion (0 changes in treatment course due to radiograph alone out of 332 clinic notes), anterior corpectomy and fusion (0 of 140), hybrid procedure (1 of 72), posterior spine fusion (5 of 357), and 360degree fusion (0 of 71) was found. Surgical indication (trauma vs. degeneration) and duration from surgery yielded no statistical significant difference in radiograph utility. The overall sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values of radiographs were 33.8%, 87.6%, 19.0%, and 93.9%, respectively. CONCLUSION.: Regardless of operative techniques performed, surgical indication, and time since surgery, routine postoperative radiographs provide low utility in guiding treatment course in asymptomatic patients. Although radiographs may provide important diagnostic utility in certain individual cases, the results of this study provide further evidence that radiographs should not be considered routine during postoperative visits, thus minimizing unnecessary radiation exposure and medical costs.

84,"Late complications after high-dose-rate interstitial brachytherapy for tongue cancer Objectives. To analyze the treatment results and late complications of high-dose-rate (HDR) interstitial brachytherapy (ISBT) for early (T1N0, T2N0) mobile tongue cancer using the microSelectron-HDR. Methods. From January 1993 through April 2001, a total of 72 patients with early squamous cell carcinomas of the mobile tongue were treated with microSelectron-HDR interstitial brachytherapy at the Department of Radiology, Osaka University Hospital. Of the patients, 18% were treated with a combination of prior external radiation and HDR-ISBT, and 82% were treated with HDR-ISBT alone. For HDR-ISBT alone, all cases were treated with a total dose of 54 Gy/9 fractions every 5 days or 60 Gy/10 fractions every 8 days. In combined therapy with an external dose of 30 to 40 Gy, HDR-ISBT was given at a total dose of 42-50 Gy. The Brinkman and alcohol indexes were used to analyze the incidence of late complications after HDR-ISBT. Results. The 2- and 5-year local control rates were 85% and 82%, respectively. Fifteen of 72 patients (21%) treated with HDR-ISBT had late complications. Ten of 15 patients (67%) with late complications had a Brinkman index exceeding 600. Conclusions. HDR-ISBT is useful and easily applied under local anesthesia to early or superficial lesions of the mobile tongue. However, we found an increase in late complications, such as soft-tissue ulcers and bone exposure, after irradiation of tongue cancer with 60 Gy HDR-ISBT in patients with a Brinkman index greater than 600. © Japanese Society for Oral and Maxillofacial Radiology Springer-Verlag Tokyo 2005.",Excluded

Material(s) and Method(s): Fifty-seven elderly patients with postoperative local recurrence of rectal carcinoma were randomly divided into a clinical group and a control group. The clinical group had 31 patients, who received 6 Mv X-ray 3DCRT, 2 Gy per time, 5 times every week. After radiotherapy for the total pelvis until target dose (DT) in tumor focus reached 40 Gy/20f, the tumor focus was intensified up to DT 60-64 Gy with 8 Mv X-ray DT 20-24 Gy. During radiotherapy, the patients were treated with XELOX (oxaliplatin 85 mg/m2, dl, Xeloda 850 mg/m2, p.o. d1-14) for two periods. The control group had 26 pa tients, who were only treated with XELOX. Result(s): The responder rate (RR) of the clinical group was 87.1%.

The familial risk could be explained by high-penetrance mutations in yet unidentified genes, or polygenic action of low-penetrance alleles. Since the DNA-damaging exposure to ionizing radiation is a known risk factor for thyroid cancer, polymorphisms in DNA repair genes are likely to affect this risk. In a search for low-penetrance susceptibility alleles we employed Sequenom technology to genotype deleterious polymorphisms in ATM, CHEK2, and BRCA1 in 1,781 PTC patients and 2,081 healthy controls. As a result of the study, we identified CHEK2 rs17879961 (OR=2.2, P=2.37e-10) and BRCA1 rs16941 (odds ratio [OR]=1.16, P=0.005) as risk alleles for PTC. The ATM rs1801516 variant modifies the risk associated with the BRCA1 variant by 0.78 (P=0.02). Both the ATM and BRCA1 variants modify the impact of male gender on clinical variables: T status (P=0.007), N status (P=0.05), and stage (P=0.035). Our findings implicate an important role of variants in the ATM- CHEK2- BRCA1 axis in modification of the genetic predisposition to PTC and its clinical manifestations. © 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",Excluded
741,"Abdominal applications of 3.0-T MR imaging: comparative review versus a 1.5-T system With the development of dedicated receiver coils and increased gradient performance, 3.0-T magnetic resonance (MR) systems are gaining wider acceptance in clinical practice. The expected twofold increase in signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) compared with that of 1.5-T MR systems may help improve spatial resolution or increase temporal resolution when used with parallel acquisition techniques. Several issues must be considered when applying 3.0-T MR in the abdomen, including the alteration of the radiofrequency field and relaxation time, increase in energy deposition and susceptibility effects, and problems associated with motion artifacts. For the evaluation of liver lesions, higher SNR and greater resolution achieved with the 3.0-T system could translate into better detection of malignant lesions on T2-weighted images obtained with adjusted imaging parameters. For the evaluation of pancreatic and biliary diseases, high-resolution T2-weighted imaging using single-shot turbo spin-echo sequences is useful; improvement in SNR was noticeable on two-dimensional MR cholangiopancreatographic images. For the preoperative imaging of rectal cancer, a single-shot sequence is useful for dramatically decreasing imaging time while maintaining image quality. Substantial modification of examination protocols, with optimized imaging parameters and sequence designs along with ongoing development of hardware, could contribute to an increased role of the 3.0-T system for abdominal MR examinations.",Excluded
945,"Increased oxidative stress in barn swallows from the Chernobyl region The Chernobyl nuclear accident produced the largest unintended release of radionuclides in history, with dramatic consequences for humans and other organisms. Exposure to ionizing radiation is known to reduce circulating and stored levels of specific antioxidants in birds and humans, thus potentially increasing oxidative stress. However, overall effects of radioactive exposure on oxidative status have never been investigated in any free ranging vertebrate. We measured plasma antioxidant capacity and concentration of reactive oxygen metabolites in adult barn swallows (Hirundo rustica) from colonies with variable background radiation levels in the Chernobyl region in Ukraine and Belarus. We predicted that antioxidants would decrease while reactive oxygen metabolites would increase with exposure to increasing levels of radiation at the breeding sites. Consistent with this expectation, radiation level positively predicted plasma concentration of reactive oxygen metabolites, whereas no significant covariation was found with non-enzymatic plasma antioxidant capacity. An index of oxidative stress was also larger in barn swallows exposed to high contamination levels. Thus, radioactive contamination appeared to be responsible for the increased generation of reactive oxygen metabolites and the imbalance between reactive oxygen metabolites and non-enzymatic plasma antioxidant capacity.",Included
699,"A randomized trial of accelerated hyperfractionated radiation therapy and bis-chloroethyl nitrosourea for malignant glioma. A preliminary report of Radiation Therapy Oncology Group 83-02 BACKGROUND: The third and final randomization of Radiation Therapy Oncology Group (RTOG) 83-02 was performed to identify the maximal tolerated dose and potential efficacy of accelerated hyperfractionated radiation therapy (AHRT) in 1.6 Gy twice-daily fractions for adult malignant glioma., METHODS: From December 1987 to July 1989, 304 patients with malignant glioma were stratified by age, performance status, and histologic findings and randomized to receive total AHRT doses of 48.0 or 54.4 Gy, with 80 mg/m2 of bis-chloroethyl nitrosourea (BCNU) for 3 days every 8 weeks. Distribution of other prognostic factors, including neurologic function, extent of surgery, tumor size, and sex, was comparable in each treatment arm., RESULTS: One Grade 5 radiation therapy (RT)-related toxic effect was reported (in the 54.4-Gy treatment arm), and the incidence of late Grade 3-5 RT-related toxic effects at 18 months was 1% at 48.0 Gy and 4% at 54.4 Gy. The median survival times (MST) for the 48.0 Gy and 54.4 Gy treatment arms were 11.7 and 10.8 months, respectively, comparable to the MST in prior RTOG trials with a similar proportion of patients with glioblastoma multiforme (79%). For the 123 patients who were 60 years of age or older, the MST for the 48.0 Gy and 54.4 Gy treatment arms were 8.9 and 10.4 months, respectively, and compare favorably with the MST of 6.0 months reported with standard RT and BCNU treatment used for 101 patients who were 60 years of age or older in two prior RTOG malignant glioma trials (74-01 and 79-18). Although these results differ significantly (P = 0.0015), this contrast is not significant when adjusted by performance status., CONCLUSIONS: The maximum tolerated dose of AHRT has yet to be identified, and pursuit of this information may most benefit patients with malignant glioma who are 60 years of age or older.",Excluded
1067,"Environmental radioactivity and high incidence rates of stomach and esophagus cancer in the Van Lake Region: A causal relationship? This study examined the incidence rates of cancer cases (averages for 2006-2010) and relationships with environmental radioactivity levels. Soil and water samples were collected from provincial and district centers of Van city and the outdoor gamma doses were determined using a portable gamma scintillation detector. Gross alpha and beta, (226)Ra, (232)Th, and (40)K activities were measured in both tap water and soil samples. Although high rates of stomach and esophagus cancers have been reported previously in Van the underlying reasons have not hitherto been defined. Incidences of cancers were highest in the Gurpinar (326.0) and Ozalp (377.1) counties (p<0.001). As to the results of the gross alpha and gross beta radioactivity measurements in the drinking water, these two counties also had high beta radionuclide levels: Gurpinar (140 mBq/dm3) and Ozalp (206 mBq/dm3). Even if within the normal range, a relation between the higher rate of the incidence of stomach and esophagus cancers with that of the higher rate of beta radionuclide activity was clear. On Spearman correlation analysis, the relation between higher beta radionuclide levels and cancer incidence was found to be statistically significant (p<0.01). According to the results of the analysis, Van residents receive an average 1.86 mSv/y annual dose from outdoor gamma radiation, ingestion of radionuclides in the drinking water, and indoor 222Rn activity. Moreover, gross alpha and beta activities were found to be extremely high in all of the lakes around the city of Van, Turkey. Further investigations with long-term detailed environmental radiation measurements are needed regarding the relationship between cancer cases and environmental radioactivity in the city of Van.",Excluded
1047,"Thermophysiological consequences of whole body resonant RF exposure (100 MHz) in human volunteers Thermophysiological responses of heat production and heat loss were measured in seven adult volunteers (six males and one female, aged 31-74 years) during 45 min dorsal exposures of the whole body to 100 MHz continuous wave (CW) radio frequency (RF) energy. Three power densities (PD) (average PD = 4, 6, and 8 mW/cm(2); whole body specific absorption rate [SAR] = 0.068 [W/kg]/[mW/cm(2)]) were tested in each of three ambient temperatures (T(a) = 24, 28, and 31 degrees C), as well as in T(a) controls (no RF). A standardized protocol (30 min baseline, 45 min RF or sham exposure, 10 min baseline) was used. Measured responses included esophageal and seven skin temperatures, metabolic heat production, local sweat rate, and local skin blood flow. No changes in metabolic heat production occurred under any test condition. Unlike published results of similar exposures at 450 and 2450 MHz, local skin temperatures, even those on the back that were irradiated directly, changed little or not at all during 100 MHz exposures. The sole exception was the temperature of the ankle skin, which increased by 3-4 degrees C in some subjects at PD = 8 mW/cm(2). During the 45 min RF exposure, esophageal temperature showed modest changes (range = -0.15 to 0.13 degrees C) and never exceeded 37.2 degrees C. Thermoregulation was principally controlled by appropriate increases in evaporative heat loss (sweating) and, to a lesser extent, by changes in skin blood flow. Because of the deep penetration of RF energy at this frequency, effectively bypassing the skin, these changes must have been stimulated by thermal receptors deep in the body rather than those located in the skin.

415,"Limitations on upper bound dose to adults due to intake of 129I in drinking water and a total diet-implications relative to the proposed Yucca Mountain high level radioactive waste repository The purpose of this report is to comment on the potential annual doses due to the intake by adults of I, an important radionuclide in the proposed high-level radioactive waste repository at Yucca Mountain. An often overlooked, but significant, factor is that, in this case, the ground water, which would be the primary transport vehicle for any releases, contains relatively high concentrations of stable iodine (127I); in fact, the median concentration in the ground water in the vicinity of the proposed repository is 5.0 microg L-1. In comparison, the maximum concentration of 129I in the ground water, due to potential releases of 129I during the first 10,000 y following closure of the repository, is estimated to be approximately 3.7 x 10(-7) Bq L-1 (approximately 10(-5) pCi L-1). This would result in a 127I to 129I ratio in the water of almost 90 million to one. Assuming no other sources of these two isotopes were being consumed, this would place an upper bound on the annual committed thyroid dose of 1.2 x 10(-1) mSv (1.2 x 10(-1) mrem), less than one thousandth of the Ground Water Protection Standard of 4 mrem y-1. When the additional intake of stable and radioactive iodine in other components of the diet is considered, the overall ratio of 127I to 129I would be more than 2 billion to one. The would place an upper bound on the annual committed effective dose of approximately 2.5 x 10(-8) mSv (approximately 2.5 x 10(-6) mrem), less than one millionth of the Individual Protection Standard of 0.15 mSv (15 mrem).",Excluded

Patients were treated with PBT and chemotherapy with monthly cisplatin (on Day 1) and vinorelbine (on Days 1 and 8). The treatment doses were 74 Gy RBE for the primary site and 66 Gy RBE for the lymph nodes without elective lymph nodes. Adapted planning was made during the treatment. A total of 15 patients with Stage III NSCLC (IIIA: 4, IIIB: 11) were evaluated in this study. The median follow-up period was 21.7 months. None of the patients experienced Grade 4 or 5 non-hematologic toxicities. Acute pneumonitis was observed in three patients (Grade 1 in one, and Grade 3 in two), but Grade 3 pneumonitis was considered to be non-proton-related. Grade 3 acute esophagitis and dermatitis were observed in one and two patients, respectively. Severe ( >= Grade 3) leukocytopenia, neutropenia and thrombocytopenia were observed in 10 patients, seven patients and one patient, respectively.

210,"Intracranial germ cell tumors: A singleinstitution experience BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Intracranial germ cell tumors (GCTs) are not a common disease. We reviewed the experience of a single institution to determine the variables that affect treatment outcome. DESIGN AND SETTING: A retrospective review of patients with the diagnosis of intracranial germ cell tumors treated in a single institution (KFSHRC) during the period from March 1985 to December 2007. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Fifty-seven patients with the diagnosis of intracranial GCT were recorded in the KFSHRC Tumor Registry during the period from 1985 to 2007. Seven patients with a pineal region tumor treated as germinomas in the earlier years without a tissue diagnosis were excluded. This retrospective study was restricted to the remaining 50 patients with a tissue or marker diagnosis: 31 germinomas and 19 non-germinomatous germ cell tumors (NGGCTs). RESULT(S): The 10-year overall survival (OS), event-free survival (EFS) and relapse-free survival (RFS) were 87%, 88% and 96% for patients with germinoma, with a median follow-up of 4.5 (range 2-17) years, compared with 26%, 29% and 46% for patients with NGGCT with a median follow-up of 3 (range 1.5-13) years. For NGGCT, variables favorably influencing OS were younger age (< 16 y vs >=16 y, P=.01), higher radiation dose (>50 Gy vs <=50 Gy; P=.03) and later year of diagnosis (>1990 vs <1990 P=.002). CONCLUSION(S): Tissue diagnosis of GCTs is mandatory prior to treatment except for patients with elevated markers. In germinoma, localized radiotherapy (RT) for M0 patients may be adequate. Long-term follow-up is needed to define the benefit of adding chemotherapy. For NGGCT, the use of combined modality treatment and RT dose >50 Gy are important factors that influence the outcome.

1171,"Diagnostic and prognostic value of coronary artery calcium score of zero: Is it time for guidelines to change? Introduction: Cardiac computed tomography (CT) use has progressively increased as the preferred initial test to rule out coronary artery disease (CAD) when clinical likelihood is low. Coronary artery calcium (CAC) detected by CT is a well-established marker for cardiovascular risk. However, it is not recommended for diagnosis of obstructive CAD. Absence of CAC, defined as an Agatston score of zero, has been associated to good prognosis despite underestimation of non-calcified plaques. Purpose(s): To evaluate whether zero CAC score could help ruling out obstructive CAD in a safely manner. Method(s): Observational study based on a prospective database of patients (pts) referred to cardiac CT between 2017 and 2019. Pts with an Agatston score of zero were selected. Result(s): We included 176 pts with zero CAC score and non-invasive coronary angiography performed. The median duration of follow-up was 23.9 months. Baseline characteristics of the population are shown in Table 1. In 117 pts (66.5%), cardiac CT was indicated as part of their chest pain evaluation. Mean age was 57.2 years old, 68.2% were women and only and 9.4% were active smokers. Normal coronary arteries were found in 173 pts (98.3%). Obstructive CAD, defined as >=50% luminal diameter stenosis of a major vessel, was present in 1/176 (0.6%); while non-obstructive atherosclerotic plaques were found in 2 pts (1.1%). During follow-up, one patient died of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest. None either suffered from myocardial infarction or needed coronary revascularization. Conclusion(s): In our cohort, a zero CAC score detected by cardiac CT rules out obstructive coronary artery disease in 98.3%, with only 1.7% of non-calcified atherosclerosis plaques and 0.6% of major adverse events. Although further research on this topic is needed, these results support the fact that non-invasive coronary angiography could be avoided in patients with low clinical likelihood of CAD and zero CAC score, facilitating the management of the increasing demand for coronary CT and reduction of radiation dose.",Excluded
68,"A short radiotherapy course for locally advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Effective palliation and patients' convenience In order to facilitate patients with symptomatic locally advanced NSCLC, especially those coming from remote areas we have employed two palliative RT schedules. The first (S1) is the well known from Medical Research Council (MRC) randomized studies 2 x 8.5 Gy one week apart and the second (S2) is a two-day RT schedule: three fractions of 4.25 Gy are given on the first day and two fractions of 4.25 Gy on the second day. The records of 92 patients were reviewed (48 for S1 and 44 for S2). Patients, disease characteristics and results were similar for both groups; rates of symptom disappearance were for S1 and S2, respectively: cough 24 and 20%, hemoptysis 60 and 67%, chest pain 57 and 64% and dyspnoea 55 and 45% The overall condition improved in 39 and 36%, respectively. The median palliation time in days was in S1 and S2, respectively: cough 70 and 66, haemoptysis 133 and 139, chest pain 68 and 62 and dyspnoea 74 and 69 days. The median survival was 25 weeks in both S1 and S2 groups (P = 0.89 log-rank test). At 52 weeks (one year), ten (21%) and seven (16%) of the patients were alive in S1 and S2 groups, respectively. At 104 weeks, the corresponding figures were two (4%) and two (4.7%) for S1 and S2. Our results are in accordance to those reported in literature regarding the safety and efficacy of palliative hypofractionated radiotherapy schemes.

The activity values in the liver, spleen, and kidneys were calculated from the 2D WB scans, and also from the 3D SPECT images reconstructed, using quantitative image processing. Absorbed doses after the administration of (90)Y-ibritumomab tiuxetan were calculated from the (111)In WB activity values combined with reference organ masses and also from the SPECT activity values and organ masses as estimated from the patient CT scan. To assess the quantitative accuracy of the WB and SPECT scans, an abdominal phantom was also studied., RESULTS: The differences between organ masses estimated from the patient CT and from the reference MIRD models were between -10% and +98%. Using the phantom, errors in organ and tumor activity estimates were between -86% and 10% for the WB protocol and between -43% and -6% for the SPECT protocol. Patient liver, spleen, and kidney activity values determined from SPECT were systematically less than those from the WB scans. Radiation-absorbed doses calculated with the 3D protocol were systematically lower than those calculated from the WB protocol (29%+/-26%, 73%+/-26%, and 33%+/-53% differences in the liver, spleen, and kidney, respectively), except in the kidneys of 2 patients and in the liver of 1 patient., CONCLUSIONS: Accounting for patient-specific organ mass and using SPECT activity quantification have both a great impact on estimated absorbed doses.",Excluded
506,"Ventilatory inhomogeneity determined from multiple-breath washouts during sustained microgravity on Spacelab SLS-1 We used multiple-breath N2 washouts (MBNW) to study the inhomogeneity of ventilation in four normal humans (mean age 42.5 yr) before, during, and after 9 days of exposure to microgravity on Spacelab Life Sciences-1. Subjects performed 20-breath MBNW at tidal volumes of approximately 700 ml and 12-breath MBNW at tidal volumes of approximately 1,250 ml. Six indexes of ventilatory inhomogeneity were derived from data from 1) distribution of specific ventilation (SV) from mixed-expired and 2) end-tidal N2, 3) change of slope of N2 washout (semilog plot) with time, 4) change of slope of normalized phase III of successive breaths, 5) anatomic dead space, and 6) Bohr dead space. Significant ventilatory inhomogeneity was seen in the standing position at normal gravity (1 G). When we compared standing 1 G with microgravity, the distributions of SV became slightly narrower, but the difference was not significant. Also, there were no significant changes in the change of slope of the N2 washout, change of normalized phase III slopes, or the anatomic and Bohr dead spaces. By contrast, transition from the standing to supine position in 1 G resulted in significantly broader distributions of SV (P < 0.05) and significantly greater changes in the changes in slope of the N2 washouts (P < 0.001), indicating more ventilatory inhomogeneity in that posture. Thus these techniques can detect relatively small changes in ventilatory inhomogeneity. We conclude that the primary determinants of ventilatory inhomogeneity during tidal breathing in the upright posture are not gravitational in origin.",Excluded

The purpose of this study was to assess the feasibility of using an ultra-low frame rate and antiscatter grid-less radiation protocol during complex left atrial ablations to minimize radiation exposure for the patient and staff., Methods and results: A total of 150 consecutive patients undergoing left atrial ablations in our hospital were included in the analysis. The procedures were performed between January 2015 and November 2016. Of the included patients 75 (50%) underwent ablation before and 75 (50%) after the ultra-low frame rate (reduced from 4 to 2 FPS) and antiscatter grid-less radiation protocol was established. Procedures performed after the dose reduction protocol was established showed a 64% reduction of the dose area product (630.28 +/- 550.96 vs. 226.44 +/- 277.44 microGym2, P < 0.001), while fluoroscopy duration (14.22 +/- 4.47 vs. 13.62 +/- 7.11 min, P = 0.066) and procedural duration (1:48 +/- 0:28 vs. 1:53 +/- 0:34 min, P = 0.525) were not prolonged. Acute procedural success was achieved in all procedures. Two complications occurred before and one complication after the protocol was established. During four procedures, operators decided to re-introduce the antiscatter grid. This was due to impaired visibility in morbidly obese patients (n = 2) or technically difficult transseptal puncture (n = 2)., Conclusion: The use of an ultra low framerate and antiscatter grid-less radiation protocol effectively reduced radiation dose for complex left atrial ablation procedures and lead to very low average patient doses.

This study was undertaken to investigate prospectively the influence of the BBD on treatment reproducibility in patients irradiated preoperatively in the prone position., PATIENTS AND METHODS: 23 patients with rectal carcinoma in clinical stages II/III were included in this study. Axis displacement was evaluated in 14 patients treated without the BBD and nine with. The BBD is a commercial device (Belly Board, Radiation Products Design, Albertville, MN) made of a 17-cm thick hard sponge with an opening of 42 x 42 cm2. No specific patient immobilization devices were used. During radiotherapy, twelve patients had four control films, while eleven patients had three. The mean treatment position deviation was calculated for the medio-lateral, cranio-caudal and antero-posterior directions., RESULTS: When comparing the first control film to the corresponding simulation film for patients without the BBD and with the BBD, the mean lateral displacements were 1.5 mm and 3.2 mm (p = 0.26), the mean cranio-caudal displacements were 1.55 mm and 4.2 mm (p = 0.13), and the mean antero-posterior displacements were 1.8 mm and 4.5 mm (p = 0.04), respectively. When considering all control films, for the three directions, the amplitudes of the displacements were greater when using the BBD, particularly for the antero-posterior direction where the difference was highly significant (p = 0.0006)., CONCLUSIONS: Our data show that, in patients treated prone for rectal cancer, the use of the BBD in the preoperative setting without immobilization devices was associated with problems of patient position reproducibility, particularly for the antero-posterior direction. Thus, the use of patient immobilization devices and/or individual custom-made BBD may be recommended if a decision to treat the patient with a BBD is taken.",Excluded

Patients who received radiation therapy had no clearance of saccharin from the nasal cavity at a minimum of 20 minutes. The controls had a median clearance time of 5 minutes.

192,"Apparent migration of implantable port devices: normal variations in consideration of BMI PURPOSE: To evaluate the extent of normal variation in implantable port devices between supine fluoroscopy and upright chest x-ray in relation to body mass index (BMI) based on three different measurement methods.
METHODS: Retrospectively, 80 patients with implanted central venous access port systems from 2012-01-01 until 2013-12-31 were analyzed. Three parameters (two quantitative and one semi-quantitative) were determined to assess port positions: projection of port capsule to anterior ribs (PCP) and intercostal spaces, ratio of extra- and intravascular catheter portions (EX/IV), normalized distance of catheter tip to carina (nCTCD). Changes were analyzed for males and females and normal-weight and overweight patients using analysis of variance with Bonferroni-corrected pairwise comparison.
RESULTS: PCP revealed significantly greater changes in chest x-rays in overweight women than in the other groups (p&lt;0.001, F-test). EX/IV showed a significantly higher increase in overweight women than normal-weight women and men and overweight men (p&lt;0.001). nCTCD showed a significantly greater increase in overweight women than overweight men (p = 0.0130). There were no significant differences between the other groups. Inter- and intra-observer reproducibility was high (Cronbach alpha of 0.923-1.0) and best for EX/IV.
CONCLUSIONS: Central venous port systems show wide normal variations in the projection of catheter tip and port capsule. In overweight women apparent catheter migration is significantly greater compared with normal-weight women and with men. The measurement of EX/IV and PCP are straightforward methods, quick to perform, and show higher reproducibility than measurement of catheter tip-to-carina distance.",Excluded
