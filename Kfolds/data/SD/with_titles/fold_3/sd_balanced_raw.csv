3153,"Cataract and latitude For many years, it has been suggested that exposure to sunlight, particularly its ultraviolet component, may be associated with an increased risk of senile cataract. This paper addresses 1) the physical and geographic variables that affect the entry of ultraviolet light in the eye; 2) the epidemiologic evidence that associates cataract with ultraviolet light exposure; and 3) the effectiveness of personal barrier protection (i.e. sunglasses and hats) in reducing ocular exposure to ultraviolet light. The epidemiologic evidence is drawn from studies in Australia, China, Tibet, and the United States. The U.S. evidence consists of data from the Maryland Watermen study and analyses of cataract surgery under the Medicare program which provides health insurance for nearly all Americans age 65 and over (30 million) and pays for 85% of the 1.3 million cataract extractions performed annually in the U.S. Analysis of the Medicard data shown that, after controlling for age, sex, and race, and income of the population and also controlling for supply of ophthalmologists, optometrists, price of surgery and local practice costs, the strongest predictor of cataract surgery likelihood in a Medicare beneficiary is the person's latitude of residence. Latitude correlates directly with the UV-B content of sunlight, because the incident angle of the sun determines the atmospheric penetration of ultraviolet radiation. Data suggest that the probability of cataract surgery in the U.S. increases by 3% for each 1 degree decrease (i.e. more Southerly) in latitude.",Excluded
1902,"Lack of effect of the MR (mutator) factor on the maternal repair system in Drosophila melanogaster Experiments were designed to test whether the functioning of the maternal repair system will be different in females heterozygous for MR (male recombination factor) relative to that in females not carrying the MR. Muller-5 males were irradiated and mated to either MR/ + or Cy/ + females, and the frequencies of sex-linked recessive lethals in mature spermatozoa were determined and compared. The frequencies were similar with both types of female, demonstrating that heterozygosity for MR does not lead to an alteration in the functioning of the maternal repair system.",Excluded
1170,"Does the Gamma Knife dose rate affect outcomes in radiosurgery for trigeminal neuralgia? OBJECT: The object of this study was to determine whether the radiation dose rate affects clinical outcomes in patients who undergo stereotactic Gamma Knife surgery (GKS) to manage typical trigeminal neuralgia (TN)., METHODS: The authors retrospectively studied pain relief in 165 patients with medically intractable TN, who underwent 80-Gy GKS using a single 4-mm collimator between 1994 and 2005. No patient had received prior radiation treatment. The measured relative helmet output factor of the Gamma Knife was 0.8 throughout this interval, and the dose rate varied from 1.21 Gy/minute to 3.74 Gy/minute (median 2.06 Gy/minute). Irradiation time varied from 26.73 to 95.11 minutes. The authors divided patients into a low-dose-rate (LDR) group, in which the dose rate varied from 1.21 to 2.05 Gy/minute, and a high-dose-rate (HDR) group, in which the dose rate varied from 2.06 to 3.74 Gy/minute. Post-GKS, the patients' pain control was determined using the Barrow Neurological Institute (BNI) pain scale. There was no statistically significant difference between groups with respect to history of prior microvascular decompression (p = 0.410) or peripheral neuroablative procedures (p = 0.583). The length of symptoms in patients varied from 3 to 414 months with a median of 84 months (p = 0.698). Median follow-up was 26 months with a maximum of 139 months., RESULTS: Initial pain relief was obtained in 71% of patients in the LDR group and 78% in the HDR group (p = 0.547). Patients who initially obtained improved pain relief (BNI Scores I-IIIa) after GKS maintained pain control for median durations of 52 months (LDR group) and 54 months (HDR group) (p = 0.403). New or increased facial sensory dysfunction was found in 14.5% of patients in the LDR group and in 19.3% of patients in the HDR group (p = 0.479)., CONCLUSIONS: The authors found that the GKS dose rate did not affect pain control or morbidity within the range of 1.21-3.74 Gy/minute. Cobalt 60 source decay did not affect outcomes of GKS for TN pain management, even for dose rates approximating a 2-half-life decay of the isotope.",Excluded
42,"Back-scattered electron imaging and elemental analysis of retrieved bone tissue following sinus augmentation with deproteinized bovine bone or biphasic calcium phosphate OBJECTIVES: To compare resorption of a synthetic biphasic calcium phosphate (BCP) bone-graft substitute with deproteinized bovine bone (DBB) used for human maxillary sinus augmentation., MATERIALS AND METHODS: Eleven patients underwent bilateral maxillary sinus floor augmentation with DBB in one side and a BCP (40%beta-tricalcium phosphate (beta-TCP) and 60% hydroxyapatite) in the contralateral side. Simultaneously, with the augmentation on each side a microimplant was placed vertically from the top of the alveolar crest penetrating the residual bone and the grafting material. Eight months after initial surgery the microimplants were retrieved with a surrounding bone core. The composition of residual graft material and surrounding bone was analysed by scanning electron microscopy and energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy., RESULTS: Residual graft material of both types was present as 10-500 mum particles in direct contact with, or completely surrounded by, newly formed bone; smaller particles were also present in non-mineralized tissue. In the case of BCP the bone-graft substitute interface showed evidence of superficial disintegration of particles into individual grains. Median Ca/P ratios (at.%), determined from >200 discreet sites within residual graft particles and adjacent bone, were: DBB: 1.61 (confidence interval [CI] 1.59-1.64); BCP: 1.5 (CI 1.45-1.52); DBB-augmented bone: 1.62 (CI 1.59-1.66); BCP-augmented bone: 1.52 (CI 1.47-1.55); P=0.028 for DBB vs. BCP and DBB- vs. BCP-augmented bone. The reduction in Ca/P ratio for BCP over the healing period is consistent with the dissolution of beta-TCP and reprecipitation on the surface of calcium-deficient hydroxyapatite., CONCLUSION: The beta-TCP component of BCP may be gradually substituted by calcium-deficient hydroxyapatite over the healing period. This process and superficial degranulation of BCP particles may influence the progress of resorption and healing.",Excluded

1083,"Antibiotic protocol for the prevention of osteoradionecrosis following dental extractions in irradiated head and neck cancer patients: A 10 years prospective study Aims of Study: The aim of the study was to establish the long term efficacy of a perioperative antibiotic protocol combined with antibacterial mouthwashes in preventing osteoradionecrosis (ORN). Material(s) and Method(s): Irradiated head and neck cancer patients reporting for dental extractions were prospectively enrolled to the study between January 2002 and December 2009. Selection criteria for the patients included the presence of nonrestorable tooth/teeth in the field of radiation, latency period of 6 months since completion of radiotherapy, radiation dosages >60 Gy, and availability for follow-up. Starting from 10 days preextraction, the patients were prescribed 8th hourly oral amoxicillin 500 mg along with 12th hourly mouthwashes using 10 ml of undiluted chlorhexidine gluconate 0.2% solution. The same prescription was continued for 7 days postextraction. All patients were followed-up at regular intervals until December 2013. Result(s): A total of 89 patients (55 male and 34 female) underwent extractions of teeth which were present in the radiation field. Mean age of the patients was 41.8 years (range 36-54 years) and extractions were done between 12 and 33 months (mean - 15 months) postradiation therapy. Altogether, 232 teeth were extracted (maxilla - 78/mandible - 154) at an average of 2.6 teeth per patients. After a mean follow-up period of 63 months (range 48-123 months) there were no reported cases of ORN. Conclusion(s): Based on the results of this study, perioperative oral antibiotics in combination with antibacterial mouthwashes are effective in preventing ORN following dental extractions in irradiated patients.",Excluded
2208,"Gamma knife radiosurgery for trigeminal neuralgia: Results and potentially predictive parameters - Part I: Idiopathic trigeminal neuralgia OBJECTIVE: Gamma knife radiosurgery (GKR) is an increasingly used, minimally invasive treatment option for patients with trigeminal neuralgia (TN) refractory to medical therapy. This retrospective study evaluates the long-term results and side effects of GKR in the treatment of TN focusing on potentially predictive factors. METHOD(S): One hundred sixty patients with TN were included in this study (minimum follow-up, >6 mo; mean, 37.4 mo; range, 6-144 mo). In 92 patients, GKR represented the first nonmedical option (""primary GKR""). In 68 patients, invasive treatments had been previously attempted. All patients were treated using a single 4-mm collimator shot targeting the pontine trigeminal root entry zone with a maximal dose of 75 to 95 Gy. Brainstem dose exposure never exceeded 15 Gy. Treatment outcome results were classified as Grade I (pain-free with no pharmacological treatment), Grade II (pain-free with pharmacological treatment), and Grade III (no result). Data were analyzed using the log-rank test for univariate analysis and the ordered logit model for multivariate analysis. RESULT(S): In the overall series, 98 (61%) out of 160 patients reached a Grade I outcome, 45 (29%) reached a Grade II outcome, and 17 (10%) patients had no results from GKR. These results were encouraging for patients with typical facial pain features and for patients treated by a ""primary"" gamma knife. Considering the global outcome, the most effective and safest dose was found to be in the 80 to 90 Gy range. CONCLUSION(S): According to our experience, GKR represents a reliable second-line therapeutic approach for TN after pharmacological failure. Favorable prognostic factors include ""primary GKR"" and maximal GKR dose ranging between 80 and 90 Gy. Copyright © by the Congress of Neurological Surgeons.",Excluded
1710,"Towards improved prognostic scores predicting survival in patients with brain metastases: A pilot study of serum lactate dehydrogenase levels Accurate prognostic information is desirable when counselling patients with brain metastases regarding their therapeutic options and life expectancy. Based on previous studies, we selected serum lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) as a promising factor on which we perform a pilot study investigating methodological aspects of biomarker studies in patients with brain metastases, before embarking on large-scale studies that will look at a larger number of candidate markers in an expanded patient cohort. For this retrospective analysis, 100 patients with available information on LDH treated with palliative whole-brain radiotherapy were selected. A comprehensive evaluation of different LDH-based variables was performed in uni- and multivariate tests. Probably, the most intriguing finding was that LDH kinetics might be more important, or at least complement, information obtained from a single measurement immediately before radiotherapy. LDH and performance status outperformed several other variables that are part of prognostic models such as recursive partitioning analyses classes and graded prognostic assessment score. LDH kinetics might reflect disease behaviour in extracranial metastatic and primary sites without need for comprehensive imaging studies and is a quite inexpensive diagnostic test. Based on these encouraging results, confirmatory studies in a larger cohort of patients are warranted. Copyright 2012 Carsten Nieder et al.",Excluded
3288,"Emotional determinants of life-space through GPS and ecological momentary assessment in schizophrenia: What gets people out of the house? Background: Previous research employing global positioning satellite (GPS) data and ecological momentary assessment (EMA) has shown a smaller life-space (distance traveled from home) was associated with poorer community functioning and more severe negative symptoms in people with schizophrenia. Momentary emotional experiences may influence how much time is spent outside of the home. We evaluated the associations between emotional experiences in relation to life-space among people with schizophrenia compared to healthy controls (HCs). Method(s): 105 participants with schizophrenia and 76 HCs completed in-lab assessments of symptoms, cognition, and functioning. Participants completed EMA assessments of location and emotions seven times daily for seven days at stratified random intervals. GPS coordinates were collected 24 h a day over the 7-day study period. Analyses were performed at the momentary, day, and full week level using mixed effects models and Spearman correlations. Result(s): For HCs, greater happiness was associated with greater concurrent distance traveled away from home as measured by GPS. For participants with schizophrenia, greater anxiety was associated with greater distance traveled away from home and being outside of the home. Less happiness, but not anxiety, was also associated with greater negative symptoms, especially outside the home. Discussion(s): These findings suggest diminished positive emotion is associated with the experience of leaving the home in schizophrenia, but also suggest that anxiety may contribute to avoidance of out of home mobility. Interventions targeting both positive emotions and social anxiety may improve social functioning, and life-space may provide a useful outcome for functional rehabilitation interventions in schizophrenia.Copyright © 2020",Excluded
183,"Ultrastructural and elemental analysis of sialoliths and their comparison with nephroliths AIM: Sialoliths are common in the submandibular gland and its duct system, although their exact cause of formation is still a matter of debate. The aims of this study were to: (a) analyze sialoliths ultrastructurally, and to determine the role of foreign bodies or organic materials in the formation of sialolith nuclei; and (b) compare nephroliths with sialoliths ultrastructurally., METHODS: Three sialoliths and two nephroliths were analyzed ultrastructurally by a scanning electron microscope and X-ray diffractometer., RESULTS: The main structures of the sialoliths were found to be hydroxyapatite crystals. No organic cores were observed in the central parts of the sialoliths. In nephroliths, calcium oxalate, calcium phosphate, and struvite crystals were found. The energy-dispersive X-ray microanalysis found that sialoliths and nephroliths were predominantly composed of elements comprising calcium, phosphorous, magnesium, sodium, chloride, silicon, iron, and potassium., CONCLUSION: Sialoliths in the submandibular salivary glands might form secondary to sialadenitis, but not via a luminal organic nidus.Copyright © 2014 Wiley Publishing Asia Pty Ltd.",Excluded
804,"Cause-of-death registers in radiation-contaminated areas of the Russian Federation and Kazakhstan Since the early 1990s, information on radiation-exposed populations other than those exposed from the Chernobyl accident in 1986 has become increasingly available for international scientific research. It is essential to understand how the cohorts of exposed populations have been defined and what mechanisms can be used to study their health outcomes. Different international scientific research collaborations currently investigate four population groups chronically exposed to ionizing radiation during the late 1940s and early 1950s in the Russian Federation and in Kazakhstan. In this framework, collaborations have been established to develop cause-of-death registers in each of these four areas for future mortality follow-up purposes with the aim of studying the health effects of ionizing radiation. The emphasis of this effort is on assessing the information sources available, the mechanisms of data collection and coding, and the data quality and completeness of the information collected. One of the major challenges is the harmonization of all these aspects between the four different centers to the extent possible, taking into account that much of the actual data has been collected over many decades.",Excluded

Method(s): A dendrimer compound containing an average of 55 Yb+3 ions per dendrimer was prepared and irradiated with neutrons for 2h at 3x1011 n.cm-2s-1 neutron flux. The resulting mixture was injected into a group of tumor bearing mice and the mice were excised, weighed and counted at certain times to study the biodistribution. The human organs absorbed dose was assessed by MIRD schema and MCNP simulation. Result(s): The specific activity and radiochemical purity of the irradiated nano-composite were 7MBq/mg and >99% respectively. The rapid up take of dendrimer was in liver, lung, and, spleen. MIRD and MCNPX were applied for dose estimation.

3213,"The roles of Bcl-xL in modulating apoptosis during development of Xenopus laevis BACKGROUND: Apoptosis is a common and essential aspect of development. It is particularly prevalent in the central nervous system and during remodelling processes such as formation of the digits and in amphibian metamorphosis. Apoptosis, which is dependent upon a balance between pro- and anti-apoptotic factors, also enables the embryo to rid itself of cells damaged by gamma irradiation. In this study, the roles of the anti-apoptotic factor Bcl-xL in protecting cells from apoptosis were examined in Xenopus laevis embryos using transgenesis to overexpress the XR11 gene, which encodes Bcl-xL. The effects on developmental, thyroid hormone-induced and gamma-radiation-induced apoptosis in embryos were examined in these transgenic animals., RESULTS: Apoptosis was abrogated in XR11 transgenic embryos. However, the transgene did not prevent the apoptotic response of tadpoles to thyroid hormone during metamorphosis. Post-metamorphic XR11 frogs were reared to sexual maturity, thus allowing us to produce second-generation embryos and enabling us to distinguish between the maternal and zygotic contributions of Bcl-xL to the gamma-radiation apoptotic response. Wild-type embryos irradiated before the mid-blastula transition (MBT) underwent normal cell division until reaching the MBT, after which they underwent massive, catastrophic apoptosis. Over-expression of Bcl-xL derived from XR11 females, but not males, provided partial protection from apoptosis. Maternal expression of XR11 was also sufficient to abrogate apoptosis triggered by post-MBT gamma-radiation. Tolerance to post-MBT gamma-radiation from zygotically-derived XR11 was acquired gradually after the MBT in spite of abundant XR11 protein synthesis., CONCLUSION: Our data suggest that Bcl-xL is an effective counterbalance to proapoptotic factors during embryonic development but has no apparent effect on the thyroid hormone-induced apoptosis that occurs during metamorphosis. Furthermore, post-MBT apoptosis triggered by irradiation before the MBT could only be restrained by maternal expression of Bcl-xL. Although maternal expression of XR11 was sufficient to abrogate apoptosis triggered by post-MBT gamma-radiation, radiation tolerance from zygotically-derived XR11 was acquired gradually, indicating that synthesis of XR11 protein is not sufficient to prevent apoptosis. Thus, repression of radiation-induced apoptosis by overexpression of Bcl-xL during embryonic development depends upon the timing of its expression and post-translational events that enable the protein to become effective.",Excluded
2253,"The epicondylar ratio can be reliably used on X-ray of the knee to determine the joint line Purpose: The epicondylar ratio (ER) is used to restore the individual joint line (JL), especially in revision total knee arthroplasty. It was first described in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) but is usually applied to a.p. radiographs of the knee for preoperative planning. The objective of the current study was to define reliable landmarks in MRI and X-ray images of the knee, which allow comparison of the image modalities. Furthermore, the correlation of the measured ER in MRI and X-rays of the knee was calculated. Method(s): A consecutive series of 87 patients who underwent an arthroscopical intervention of the knee were included into the present study. The lateral epicondyle was defined as the most lateral and distal prominence. On the medial side, the measurement was aligned to the epicondylar sulcus. The medial and lateral ER were calculated by dividing the perpendicular distance from the JL to the epicondyle by the transepicondylar distance. One observer determined the ER twice to calculate the intramethod intraobserver agreement, and a second observer obtained the intramethod interobserer agreement. The ER obtained from X-ray and MRI was compared to calculate the intermethod correlation. Result(s): The average lateral ER was 0.29 on X-ray versus 0.28 on MRI. The average medial ER was 0.33 and 0.33, respectively. Intramethod agreement ranged from 0.66 to 0.88 and intermethod correlation from 0.49 to 0.57. Conclusion(s): The ER can be determined reliably on MRI and X-ray images of the knee.

1191,"Indwelling voice prosthesis insertion after total pharyngolaryngectomy with free jejunal reconstruction Objectives: Total pharyngolaryngectomy with free jejunal reconstruction is often performed in patients with hypopharyngeal carcinoma. However, postoperative speechlessness significantly decreases patient quality of life. We investigated whether Provox insertion could preserve speech after total pharyngolaryngectomy with free jejunal reconstruction. Study Design: Retrospective chart review. Method(s): A total of 130 cases of secondary Provox insertions after total pharyngolaryngectomy with free jejunal reconstruction were analyzed. Communication outcomes were compared using the Head and Neck Cancer Understandability of Speech Subscale. Outcomes and complications associated with insertion site (jejunal insertion vs. esophageal insertion) and adjuvant irradiation therapy were also evaluated. Result(s): Provox insertion had favorable communication outcomes in 102 cases (78.4%). Neither the insertion site nor irradiation affected the communication outcome. Complications were observed in 20 cases (15.4%). Local infection was the most common complication. Free jejunal insertion, in which the resection range was enlarged, had a lower complication rate than did esophageal insertion, and its complication rate was unaffected by previous irradiation. For all patients, the hospitalization duration and duration of speechlessness were 13.4 days and 14.6 months, respectively. Patients receiving jejunal insertions had a significantly shorter hospitalization duration than did those receiving esophageal insertions. Unlike Provox2, ProvoxVega significantly reduced the complication rate to zero. Conclusion(s): For jejunal inserson of a Provox prosthetic, a sufficient margin can be maintained during total pharyngolaryngectomy and irradiation can be performed, and satisfactory communication outcomes were observed. Provox insertion after total pharyngolaryngectomy with free jejunal reconstruction should be considered the standard therapy for voice restoration.

To investigate whether it is possible to obtain adequate images at uniform image noise levels and reduced radiation exposure with our automatic tube current modulation (ATCM) technique for 64-detector CT. The study population consisted of 64 patients with known or suspected lung or abdominal disease. We used a 64-detector CT scanner (LightSpeed VCT, GE Healthcare, Waukesha, WI, USA) and a combined angular and longitudinal tube current modulation technique (Smart mA, GE Healthcare, Waukesha, WI, USA) to examine 34 patients. The scanning parameters were identical; the minimum and maximum tube current thresholds were 50 and 800 mA, respectively. For study of the constant tube current technique, 30 additional patients were examined at 350 mA. The CT number and image noise (SD of the CT number) were measured in the 64 patients at six levels, i.e., the center of the left ventricle, the liver dome, the porta hepatis, the center of the spleen and the right and left renal pelvis. When we used the ATCM technique, the mean image noise ranged from 8.40 at the center of the left ventricle to 11.31 at the porta hepatis; the mean tube current ranged from 105.9 mAs at the center of the left ventricle to 169.6 mAs at the center of the spleen.

2118,"Impact of proton pump inhibitor treatment on gastrointestinal bleeding associated with non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug use among post-myocardial infarction patients taking antithrombotics: Nationwide study Study question What is the effect of proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) on the risk of gastrointestinal bleeding in post-myocardial infarction patients taking antithrombotics and treated with non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs)? Methods This was a nationwide cohort study based on linked administrative registry data from all hospitals in Denmark between 1997 and 2011. The study included patients aged 30 years and over admitted with a first myocardial infarction who survived at least 30 days after discharge. The association between PPIs and risk of gastrointestinal bleeding according to NSAID plus antithrombotic therapy was estimated using adjusted time dependent Cox regression models. Study answer and limitations The use of PPIs was independently associated with decreased risk of gastrointestinal bleeding in postmyocardial infarction patients taking antithrombotics and treated with NSAIDs. Of 82 955 post-myocardial infarction patients (mean age 67.4 years, 64% (n=53 070) men), all of whom were taking single or dual antithrombotic therapy, 42.5% (n=35 233) filled at least one prescription for NSAIDs and 45.5% (n=37 771) received PPIs. Over a mean follow-up of 5.1 years, 3229 gastrointestinal bleeds occurred. The crude incidence rates of bleeding (events/100 person years) on NSAID plus antithrombotic therapy were 1.8 for patients taking PPIs and 2.1 for those not taking PPIs. The adjusted risk of bleeding was lower with PPI use (hazard ratio 0.72, 95% confidence interval 0.54 to 0.95) regardless of antithrombotic treatment regimen, type of NSAID, and type of PPI used. The main limitation of the study is its observational nonrandomised design. The results suggest that PPI treatment probably has a beneficial effect regardless of underlying gastrointestinal risk and that when NSAIDs cannot be avoided in post-myocardial infarction patients, physicians might prescribe a PPI as well. The study does not clarify whether PPIs might be safely omitted in specific subgroups of patients with a low risk of gastrointestinal bleeding. What this study adds In post-myocardial infarction patients, bleeding complications have been associated with both antithrombotic and NSAID treatment. Concurrent use of PPIs was independently associated with a decreased risk of gastrointestinal bleeding in postmyocardial infarction patients taking antithrombotics and NSAID, regardless of antithrombotic treatment regimen, type of NSAID, and type of PPI used.

193,"Sex-specific radiation-induced microRNAome responses in the hippocampus, cerebellum and frontal cortex in a mouse model Ionizing radiation is an important treatment modality, but it is also a well-known genotoxic agent capable of damaging cells and tissues. Therefore radiation treatment can cause numerous side effects in exposed tissues and organs. Radiotherapy is a part of the front-line treatment regime for brain cancer patients, but can cause severe functional and morphological changes in exposed brain tissues. However, the mechanisms of radiation-induced effects in the brain are not well understood and are under-investigated. Recent data has implicated short RNAs, especially microRNAs, as important in radiation responses, yet nothing is known about radiation-induced changes in the brain microRNAome. We analyzed the effects of X-ray irradiation on microRNA expression in the hippocampus, frontal cortex, and cerebellum of male and female mice. Here, we report tissue-, time-, and sex-specific brain radiation responses, as well as show evidence of an interplay between microRNAs and their targets. Specifically, we show that changes in the expression of the miR-29 family may be linked, at least in part, to altered expression of de novo methyltransferase DNMT3a and changed global DNA methylation levels. Further, these sex-specific epigenetic changes may be correlated to the prevalence of radiation-induced cancers in males. We identified several microRNAs that can potentially serve as biomarkers of brain radiation exposure. In summary, our study may provide an important roadmap for further analysis of microRNA expression in different brain regions of male and female mice and for detailed dissection of radiation-induced brain responses.",Included
3090,"Functional Outcomes of Salvage Surgery for Vestibular Schwannomas after Failed Gamma Knife Radiosurgery OBJECTIVE: We reviewed our experience with salvage surgery following failed gamma knife radiosurgery (GKS) for vestibular schwannomas., METHODS: The study comprised 18 patients with unilateral vestibular schwannomas. The median prescribed radiation dose was 12 Gy (range, 10-12.5 Gy). Nine patients had regrowth after GKS, and 9 had regrowth after surgical resection plus GKS. The median interval between GKS and surgical resection was 26 months (range: 4-66 months). The maximum tumor diameter of all patients ranged 25-43 mm (median 35.5 mm). The tumor was removed subtotally in 2 patients and partially in the other 16 patients. The median follow-up period after surgical resection was 60 months (range: 12-144 months)., RESULTS: Among the 17 patients with preoperative preserved facial nerve function (House-Brackmann [HB] grade I-III), 14 of them (82%) had an HB score of grade I at the last follow-up. There were no differences in facial nerve preservation between those with failed GKS and those with failed GKS plus surgery (78% vs. 100%, P = 0.156). At the post-salvage surgery follow-up, the residual tumor was unchanged or decreased in 15 patients (83%) and increased in 3 patients (17%)., CONCLUSION: A surgical indication after GKS should be carefully considered because of the natural regression of transient tumor expansion with time, and surgical resection is limited to subtotal or partial removal for functional preservation. Careful follow-up is necessary in patients with tumor regrowth several years after GKS due to delayed radiation effects. Copyright © 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.",Excluded
618,[Stimulation of the suppressor activity in relation to hematopoietic cells in the mouse thymus as affected by pertussis vaccine] After a single intraperitoneal injection of formalinized whole-cell pertussis vaccine 5374 into CBA mice a drastic depletion of cells in the thymus accompanied by the enhancement of suppressor T-cells production is observed. T-cells inhibit the endogenous and exogenous colony-formation in the spleen by hematopoietic stem cells (CFUs). Treatment of thymus cells with the anti-I-Jk alloantiserum against a specific marker of suppressor T-cells in the presence of complement removes the inhibitory effect on CFUs proliferation and has a stimulatory action on the capacity of the marrow CFUs to form macroscopic hematopoietic colonies in the spleen compared with control ones. These results suggest probable involvement of I-J-bearing suppressor T-cells in the hematopoietic disorders induced by pertussis vaccine.,Excluded

From January 1993 through April 2001, a total of 72 patients with early squamous cell carcinomas of the mobile tongue were treated with microSelectron-HDR interstitial brachytherapy at the Department of Radiology, Osaka University Hospital. Of the patients, 18% were treated with a combination of prior external radiation and HDR-ISBT, and 82% were treated with HDR-ISBT alone. For HDR-ISBT alone, all cases were treated with a total dose of 54 Gy/9 fractions every 5 days or 60 Gy/10 fractions every 8 days. In combined therapy with an external dose of 30 to 40 Gy, HDR-ISBT was given at a total dose of 42-50 Gy. The Brinkman and alcohol indexes were used to analyze the incidence of late complications after HDR-ISBT. Results. The 2- and 5-year local control rates were 85% and 82%, respectively. Fifteen of 72 patients (21%) treated with HDR-ISBT had late complications. Ten of 15 patients (67%) with late complications had a Brinkman index exceeding 600. Conclusions. HDR-ISBT is useful and easily applied under local anesthesia to early or superficial lesions of the mobile tongue. However, we found an increase in late complications, such as soft-tissue ulcers and bone exposure, after irradiation of tongue cancer with 60 Gy HDR-ISBT in patients with a Brinkman index greater than 600. © Japanese Society for Oral and Maxillofacial Radiology Springer-Verlag Tokyo 2005.",Excluded
1818,"Parotid gland function after radiotherapy: The combined Michigan and Utrecht experience Purpose: To analyze the combined and updated results from the University of Michigan and University Medical Center Utrecht on normal tissue complication probability (NTCP) of the parotid gland 1 year after radiotherapy (RT) for head-and-neck (HN) cancer. Patients and Methods: A total of 222 prospectively analyzed patients with various HN malignancies were treated with conventional and intensity-modulated RT. Stimulated individual parotid gland flow rates were measured before RT and 1 year after RT using Lashley cups at both centers. A flow ratio <25% of pretreatment was defined as a complication. The data were fitted to the Lyman-Kutcher-Burman model. Result(s): A total of 384 parotid glands (Michigan: 157; Utrecht: 227 glands) was available for analysis 1 year after RT. Combined NTCP analysis based on mean dose resulted in a TD50 (uniform dose leading to 50% complication probability) of 39.9 Gy and m (steepness of the curve) of 0.40. The resulting NTCP curve had good qualitative agreement with the combined clinical data. Mean doses of 25-30 Gy were associated with 17-26% NTCP. Conclusion(s): A definite NTCP curve for parotid gland function 1 year after RT is presented, based on mean dose. No threshold dose was observed, and TD50 was equal to 40 Gy.

702,"[Intensity-modulated radiation therapy for head and neck cancers with bilateral irradiation of the neck : preliminary results] PURPOSE: To report preliminary results of a prospective study of intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) for head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNC) with bilateral irradiation of the neck., PATIENTS AND METHODS: At the Alexis Vautrin Cancer Center, 23 patients have been treated with IMRT for HNC since January 2002-August 2003. The first 10 patients with a minimum follow-up of 3 months were analyzed. All tumors were oropharyngeal. There were four females and six males, with a mean age of 50 years (range 39-66). Stages were I-II in eight and III-IV in two. CTV1 was microscopic disease and N0 neck (prescribed dose : 50 Gy) and CTV2 was macroscopic disease and the volume at risk (prescribed dose: 66-70 Gy). PTV were CTV + 5 mm. Patient's immobilization consisted of a five-point head neck shoulder thermoplastic mask. Set-up verifications were done by semi-automatically matching portal images and digitized reconstructed radiographs. IMRT used dynamic multileaf collimation. Five patients (group A) received 50 Gy IMRT (two post-operative and three with a brachytherapy boost with a mean dose: 27.5 Gy), and five patients (group B) received 66-70 Gy IMRT (four post-operative). Acute and late normal tissue effects were graded according to the RTOG-EORTC radiation morbidity scoring criteria., RESULTS: With a median follow-up of 7.4 months (range 3-18.5), no patient died or had loco-regional relapse. The displacements were <4 mm in 98% cases. CTV1 and 2 received 95% of the prescribed dose in 100% of the volume. On average the mean dose to the contralateral parotid was 25.5 Gy for group A vs. 31 Gy for group B (P = 0.09). Mean doses <26 Gy were obtained in three of five patients in group A vs. zero of five patients in group B (P = 0.04). Acute skin toxicities were grade 1 in five patients, grade 2 in four and grade 3 in one. Acute mucositis cases were grade 1 in three patients, grade 2 in five and localized grade 3 in two. At 3 months, 50% of the patients had a grade 0-1 late xerostomia., CONCLUSION: The 26 Gy dose limit constraint to the contralateral parotid was easier to satisfy when IMRT was prescribed at a maximum dose of 50 Gy. Acute toxicity is low. The displacements in the mask indicate that it is possible to define the PTV as CTV + 4 mm. This reduction should decrease the mean dose to the parotids. At 3 months, a 50% rate of grade 0-1 late xerostomia encourages the hope of a very low rate at 2 years.",Excluded
1062,"Computed tomography in patients with abdominal pain and diarrhoea: Does the benefit outweigh the drawbacks? The role of computed tomography (CT) in the evaluation of abdominal pain is well established. However, concern exists in regard to procedure-related radiation levels, contrast-medium toxicity and costs. We sought to determine whether the use of abdominal CT caused major changes in the management of patients who had abdominal pain and diarrhoea. We reviewed all abdominal CT examinations that were performed at our hospital from October through December 2010. We selected 574 scans that had been performed in patients who presented with or without diarrhoea. We examined the selected medical records to determine whether the CT scan changed patients' management. A scan was considered to be management changing if a decisive intervention occurred on the basis of the scan results. Among 124 scans in patients with diarrhoea and 450 scans in patients without diarrhoea, the scan results changed management in 13 of the patients with diarrhoea (11%) and in 233 of those without diarrhoea (52%) (P<0.001). When management changed, the changes resulted from findings unrelated to diarrhoea. Despite its defined role in the assessment of abdominal pain, CT of patients that also had diarrhoea seldom caused a major change in management. The probability of CT causing such a change does not outweigh the cost, radiation risk or potential for contrast-induced nephropathy. © 2013 Royal Australasian College of Physicians.",Excluded
3399,"Response criteria in solid tumors (PERCIST/RECIST) and SUVmax in early-stage non-small cell lung cancer patients treated with stereotactic body radiotherapy Background: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the prognostic impact of Positron Emission Tomography Response Criteria in Solid Tumors (PERCIST) and Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) and of pre- and post-treatment maximum Standard Uptake Value (SUVmax) in regards to survival and tumor control for patients treated for early-stage non-small cell lung cancer (ES-NSCLC) with stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT). Method(s): This is a retrospective review of patients with ES-NSCLC treated at our institution using SBRT. Lobar, locoregional, and distant failures were evaluated based on PERCIST/RECIST and clinical course. Univariate analysis of the Kaplan-Meier curves for overall survival (OS), progression free survival (PFS), lobar control (LC), locoregional control (LRC), and distant control (DC) was conducted using the log-rank test. Pre- and post-treatment SUVmax were evaluated using cutoffs of <5 and >=5, <4 and >=4, and <3 and >=3. incrementSUVmax was also evaluated at various cutoffs. Cox regression analysis was conducted to evaluate survival outcomes based on age, gender, pre-treatment gross tumor volume (GTV), longest tumor dimension on imaging, and Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI). Result(s): This study included 95 patients (53 female, 42 male), median age 75. Lung SBRT was delivered in 3-5 fractions to a total of 48-60Gy, with a BEDalpha/beta=10Gy of at least 100Gy. Median OS and PFS from the end of SBRT was 15.4 and 11.9months, respectively. On univariate analysis, PERCIST/RECIST response correlated with PFS (p=0.039), LC (p=0.007), and LRC (p=0.015) but not OS (p=0.21) or DC (p=0.94). Pre-treatment SUVmax and post-treatment SUVmax with cutoff values of <5 and >=5, <4 and >=4, and <3 and >=3 did not predict for OS, PFS, LC, LRC, or DC. incrementSUVmax did not predict for OS, PFS, LC, LRC, or DC. On multivariate analysis, pre-treatment GTV >=30cm3 was significantly associated with worse survival outcomes when accounting for other confounding variables. Conclusion(s): PERCIST/RECIST response is associated with improved LC and PFS in patients treated for ES-NSCLC with SBRT. In contrast, pre- and post-treatment SUVmax is not predictive of disease control or survival.Copyright © 2018 The Author(s).",Excluded
1674,"Collaboration of homologous recombination and nonhomologous end-joining factors for the survival and integrity of mice and cells Homologous recombination (HR) and nonhomologous end-joining (NHEJ) are mechanistically distinct DNA repair pathways that contribute substantially to double-strand break (DSB) repair in mammalian cells. We have combined mutations in factors from both repair pathways, the HR protein Rad54 and the DNA-end-binding factor Ku80, which has a role in NHEJ. Rad54(-/-)Ku80(-/-) mice were severely compromised in their survival, such that fewer double mutants were born than expected, and only a small proportion of those born reached adulthood. However, double-mutant mice died at lower frequency from tumors than Ku80 single mutant mice, likely as a result of rapid demise at a young age from other causes. When challenged with an exogenous DNA damaging agent, ionizing radiation, double-mutant mice were exquisitely sensitive to low doses. Tissues and cells from double-mutant mice also showed indications of spontaneous DNA damage. Testes from some Rad54(-/-)Ku80(-/-) mice displayed enhanced apoptosis and reduced sperm production, and embryonic fibroblasts from Rad54(-/-)Ku80(-/-) animals accumulated foci of gamma-H2AX, a marker for DSBs. The substantially increased DNA damage response in the double mutants implies a cooperation of the two DSB repair pathways for survival and genomic integrity in the animal.",Excluded
1296,"Comparison of three dosimetric techniques to take in account lung tumor motion: Gating-like technique results lead to advice the use of gating device even in the cases of pre-operative irradiation Purpose: Comparison of three dosimetric techniques of lung tumor delineation to integrate tumor motion during breathing. Patients and Methods: Nineteen patients with T1-3N0M0 malignant lung tumor were treated with definitive chemoradiotherapy (14 cases) or pre-surgery chemoradiation. Doses were, respectively, 66 and 46 Gy. CT-scan for delineation was performed during three phases of breathing: free breathing and deep breath-hold inspiration and expiration. GTV (gross tumor volume) was delineated on the three sequences. The classic technique included GTV from the free-breathing sequence plus a CTV (clinical target volume) margin of 5 to 8 mm plus a PTV (planning target volume) margin of 7 to 10 mm (including ITV [internal target volume] margin and set-up margin). The gating-like technique included GTV from the deep breath-hold inspiration sequence plus a CTV margin of 5 to 8 mm plus a PTV margin of 2 mm. The three-volume technique, included GTV as a result of the fusion of GTVs from the three sequences plus a CTV margin of 5 to 8 mm plus a PTV margin of 2 mm. Dosimetry was calculated for the three PTVs, if possible, with the same fields number and position. Dose constraints and rules were imposed to accept dosimetries: firstly spinal cord maximal dose less than 45 Gy, followed by V95 % for PTV greater than or equal to 95 %, and V20 GYGy for lung less than or equal to 30 %, V30 GYGy for lung less than or equal to 20 %. Result(s): GTVs were not statistically different between the three methods of delineation. PTVs were significantly lower with the gating-like technique. V95% of the PTV were not different between the three techniques. With the classic-, the gating-like- and the 3-volume techniques, dosimetry was considered as acceptable, respectively in 15, 18 and 15 cases. Comparisons of constraint values showed that the gating-like method gave the best results. In the case of pre-operative management, the gating-like method allowed the best results even for the V95% values. However, in the absence of gating device or without the possibility to use it, the 3-volume method allowed to take into account more precisely the organ motion than the classical technique. Conclusion(s): The 3-volume method can be done. It is a good method to take into account the organ motions. However, the gating-like method gives the best results leading to propose its use even for pre-operative patients with upper tumors. © 2009.",Excluded
1833,"Association of pretreatment serum albumin with reduction in oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma tumor volume during curative external beam radiation therapy Purpose/Objective(s): Patients with oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) have been shown to lose more weight compared to patients with tumors at other sub-sites during external beam radiation therapy (EBRT). Furthermore, severe malnutrition before EBRT initiation may affect treatment outcome. This study investigated the association of factors, including nutritional status before treatment initiation, with gross tumor volume shrinkage rates (GTVSRs) during EBRT in OSCC patients. Materials/Methods: This retrospective study included 65 consecutive OSCC patients [55 males, 10 females, median age 65 years (38e82)] with no prior OSCC surgery. They were treated with definitive EBRT between November 2006 and December 2014. Tumors were staged as T1 (n = 7, 11%), T2 (n = 21, 32%), T3 (n = 18, 28%), T4a (n = 15, 23%), or T4b (n=4, 6%); N0 (n=9, 14%), N1 (n=3, 5%), N2a (n=3, 5%), N2b (n Z 26, 40%), N2c (n = 18, 27%), or N3 (n = 6, 9%); and as M0 (n = 64, 98%) or M1 (n = 1, 2%). Percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) was performed in 48 patients (74%) before EBRT initiation. Total radiation doses were as follows: 70 Gy, n = 62 (94%) and 71, 66, and 64 Gy, n = 1 each (2%). Computed tomography (CT) images were acquired prior to EBRT initiation and at 3e5 weeks after EBRT initiation for re-planning. Cervical body volume (CBV) was evaluated before EBRT initiation using initial CT images. GTVSRs were calculated based on initial and re-planning CT images. Four patients (6%) received induction chemotherapy (IC). Fifty-seven patients (88%) received concurrent chemotherapy (CC) using following regimen: TPF [docetaxel (DTX), cisplatin (CDDP), and 5-fluorouracil] (n = 29, 44%); another CDDP-based menu (n = 22, 34%); the other DTX-based menu (n = 3, 5%); and cetuximab (n = 3, 5%). Univariate analyses (UA) and multivariate analyses (MA) were performed to identify baseline factors related to the GTVSR. Potential variables include age, gender, T and N stage, use of IC, use of CC, CC menu, use of PEG, serum albumin (Alb), Alb globulin ratio (AGR), C-reactive protein (CRP), CBV, body weight (BW), and body mass index (BMI) before treatment initiation. Variables with UAvalues of P < 0.10 were included in MAs. Result(s): The median GTVSR was 51.1% (range, -9.8e86.8%). The median pretreatment Alb, AGR, CRP, CBV, BWand BMI were as follows: 3.7 g/dl (range, 2.5e4.7 g/dl), 1.2 (range, 0.5e1.7), 0.5 mg/dl (range, 0.1e10.4 mg/dl), 1552.3 cc (range, 962.8e2229.5 cc), 58.3 kg (range, 35.0e80.9 kg), and 20.7 kg/m2 (range, 12.9e28.8 kg/m2). In UAs, N0 stage (P = 0.032), N1>= stage (P = 0.036), Alb (P = 0.006), CBV (P = 0.007), and BW (PZ0.041) were significant. N2a>= stage (PZ0.05), use of PEG (PZ 0.052), DTX-based menu (P = 0.058), and BMI (P =0.05) were marginally significant. MAs revealed an association of higher pretreatment Alb with GTVSR (P = 0.02; 95% confidence interval, 2.94e32.47). Conclusion(s): Higher pretreatment Alb was associated with greater GTVSR during curative EBRT. Assessing pretreatment Alb may be crucial for selecting optimal OSCC treatment strategy.",Excluded
3483,"Co-registration of angiography and intravascular ultrasound images through image-based device tracking OBJECTIVES: To determine the feasibility of automated co-registration of angiography and intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) to facilitate integration of these two imaging modalities in a synchronous manner., BACKGROUND: IVUS provides cross-sectional imaging of coronary arteries but lacks overview of the vascular territory provided by angiography. Co-registration of angiography and IVUS would increase utility of IVUS in the clinical setting., METHODS: Forty-nine consecutive patients undergoing surveillance for cardiac allograft vasculopathy with angiography and IVUS of the left anterior descending artery (LAD) were enrolled. A pre-IVUS angiogram of the LAD was performed followed by an ECG-triggered fluoroscopy (ECGTF) during IVUS pullback at 0.5 mm/s using an automatic pullback device. ECGTF was used to track the IVUS catheter during pullback and establish a spatial relationship to the pre-IVUS angiogram. Angio-IVUS co-registration was performed with a research prototype (Siemens Healthcare, Germany) and accuracy was evaluated by distance mismatch between angiography and IVUS images at vessel bifurcations., RESULTS: Median age was 54 (44.5, 67) years. The population was 82.6% male with minimal risk factors. The median (IQR) co-registration distance mismatch measured at 108 bifurcations in 42 (85%) patients was 0.35 (0.00-1.16) mm. Seven patients were excluded due to inappropriate data acquisition (n = 3) and failure of tracking (n = 4), e.g., due to overlapping sternal wires. Estimated effective radiation dose for ECGTF was 0.09 mSv., CONCLUSION: This study demonstrates the feasibility of angio-IVUS co-registration which may be used as a clinical tool for localizing IVUS cross-sections along an angiographic roadmap. © 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

2988,"Esophagectomy for locally advanced esophageal cancer, followed by chemoradiotherapy and adjuvant chemotherapy Aim: To compare the efficacy and toxicity of a three-step combination therapy with post-operative radiation alone for locally advanced esophageal cancer. Method(s): Patients with T3-4 and N0-1 esophageal carcinoma from a number of institutions were non-randomly, prospectively enrolled in the study. All patients underwent single-stage curative en bloc esophagectomy. The patients were then assigned into one of two treatment groups based on treatment consisting of either post-operative concurrent chemoradiotherapy (CCRT) with weekly cisplatin 30 mg/m2 followed by systemic adjuvant chemotherapy (four monthly cycles of cisplatin 20 mg/m2 and 5-fluorouracil 1 000 mg/m2 for five consecutive days), or, post-operative radiation alone. The radiotherapy dose was 55-60 Gy for all patients. Primary end-point of this study was to assess the per-protocol patients' improvement of overall survival benefit. Secondary end-point was designed to evaluate both the per-protocol and intent-to-treat patients' outcome of survival. Result(s): A total of 60 patients (n = 30 per group) were enrolled in this study. The two groups were generally comparable for demographic characteristics and hematological and non-hematological toxicities. The CCRT with weekly cisplatin was well tolerated, with significantly better overall survival (30.9 mo vs 20.7 mo; 95% CI, 27.5-36.4 vs 15.2-26.1) and 3-year survival (70.0% vs 33.7%; P = 0.003). Low histological grade of tumor (P<0.001) was associated with favorable survival in these locally advanced patients. Conclusion(s): For locally advanced esophageal cancer, the combination of esophagectomy, post-operative CCRT with weekly cisplatin and systemic adjuvant chemotherapy is well tolerated and effective.

1743,"Radiation-Induced Myocardial Fibrosis in Long-Term Esophageal Cancer Survivors Purpose: Radiation-induced cardiac toxicity is a potential lethal complication. The aim of this study was to assess whether there is a dose-dependent relationship between radiation dose and myocardial fibrosis in patients who received neoadjuvant chemoradiation (nCRT) for esophageal cancer (EC). Methods and Materials: Forty patients with EC treated with a transthoracic esophagectomy with (n = 20) or without (n = 20) nCRT (CROSS study regimen) were included. Cardiovascular magnetic resonance imaging (1.5 Tesla) for left ventricular (LV) function, late gadolinium enhancement, and T1 mapping were performed. Extracellular volume (ECV), as a surrogate for collagen burden, was measured for all LV segments separately. The dose-response relationship between ECV and mean radiation dose per LV myocardial segment was evaluated using a mixed-model analysis. Result(s): Seventeen nCRT and 16 control patients were suitable for analysis. The mean time after treatment was 67.6 +/- 8.1 (nCRT) and 122 +/- 35 (controls) months (P = .02). In nCRT patients, we found a significantly higher mean global ECV of 28.2% compared with 24.0% in the controls (P < .001). After nCRT, LV myocardial segments with elevated ECV had received significantly higher radiation doses. In addition, a linear dose-effect relation was found with a 0.136% point increase of ECV for each Gy (P < .001). There were no differences in LV function measures and late gadolinium enhancement between both groups. Conclusion(s): Myocardial ECV was significantly higher in long-term EC survivors after nCRT compared with surgery only. Moreover, this ECV increase was linear with the radiation dose per LV segment, indicating radiation-induced myocardial fibrosis.Copyright © 2021 The Author(s)",Included

Six female teasers were taken successively to the male's cage and the copulatory behavior was recorded. Serum total testosterone, dopamine and cortisol were evaluated. The animals of the phone group were exposed to MPs (800 MHz) in a standby position for 8 h daily for 12 weeks. At the end of the study, the copulatory behavior and hormonal assays were re-evaluated. Mounts without ejaculation were the main mounts in the phone group and its duration and frequency increased significantly compared with the controls, whereas the reverse was observed in its mounts with ejaculation. Ejaculation frequency dropped significantly, biting/grasping against teasers increased notably and mounting latency in accumulated means from the first to the fourth teasers were noted in the phone group. The hormonal assays did not show any significant differences between the study groups. Therefore, the pulsed radiofrequency emitted by a conventional MP, which was kept on a standby position, could affect the sexual behavior in the rabbit.",Excluded
2043,"Effects of dual-energy CT with non-linear blending on abdominal CT angiography Objective: To determine whether non-linear blending technique for arterial-phase dual-energy abdominal CT angiography (CTA) could improve image quality compared to the linear blending technique and conventional 120 kVp imaging. Material(s) and Method(s): This study included 118 patients who had accepted dual-energy abdominal CTA in the arterial phase. They were assigned to Sn140/80 kVp protocol (protocol A, n = 40) if body mass index (BMI) < 25 or Sn140/100 kVp protocol (protocol B, n = 41) if BMI >= 25. Non-linear blending images and linear blending images with a weighting factor of 0.5 in each protocol were generated and compared with the conventional 120 kVp images (protocol C, n = 37). The abdominal vascular enhancements, image noise, signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR) and radiation dose were assessed. Statistical analysis was performed using one-way analysis of variance test, independent t test, Mann-Whitney U test, and Kruskal-Wallis test. Result(s): Mean vascular attenuation, CNR, SNR and subjective image quality score for the non-linear blending images in each protocol were all higher compared to the corresponding linear blending images and 120 kVp images (p values ranging from < 0.001 to 0.007) except for when compared to non-linear blending images for protocol B and 120 kVp images in CNR and SNR. No significant differences were found in image noise among the three kinds of images and the same kind of images in different protocols, but the lowest radiation dose was shown in protocol A.

2787,"Stereotactic single-dose radiotherapy (radiosurgery) of early stage nonsmall-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) BACKGROUND. The clinical results after stereotactic single-dose radiotherapy of nonsmall-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) stages I and II were evaluated. METHODS. Forty-two patients with biopsy-proven NSCLC received stereotactic radiotherapy. Patients were treated in a stereotactic body frame and breathing motion was reduced by abdominal compression. The single doses used ranged between 19 and 30 Gy/isocenter. RESULTS. After a median follow-up period of 15 months (range, 1.5-72 months) the actuarial overall survival rates and disease-free survival rates were 74.5%, 65.4%, 37.4%, and 70.2%, 49.1%, 49.1% at 12, 24, and 36 months after therapy, respectively. The actuarial local tumor control rates were 89.5%, 67.9%, and 67.9% at 12, 24, and 36 months after therapy, respectively. A significant difference (P = .032) in local tumor control was found for patients receiving 26-30 Gy (n = 32) compared with doses of less than 26 Gy (n = 10). The effect of the tumor volume on local tumor control was also evaluated. Although the difference was not statistically significant (P = .078), the subgroup of tumors with a tumor volume of less than 12 cm3 (n = 10) experienced no tumor recurrence. Thirteen (31%) patients developed metastases during follow-up, whereas isolated regional lymph node recurrence was only encountered in 2 patients. No clinically significant treatment-associated side effects were documented. CONCLUSIONS. Stereotactic single-dose radiotherapy is a safe and effective treatment option for patients with early stage NSCLC not suitable for surgery. Especially for small tumor volumes it seems to be equally effective as hypofractionated radiotherapy, while minimizing the overall treatment time. © 2007 American Cancer Society.",Excluded
792,"Radiosurgery for lung metastases secondary to renal cell carcinoma Purpose/Objective(s): Hypofractionated Stereotactic Body Radiosurgery (HFSR) is a noninvasive focused beam technique that delivers high-dose radiation. Reviewed were 77 treated kidney cancers metastases in the lungs of 44 patients in this prospective study. Materials/Methods: Seventy-seven renal cell carcinoma (RCC) lung metastases in 44 patients underwent HFSR. All the patients were evaluated prospectively before and after treatment. Age at treatment ranged from 42 to 85 years (mean 65.9) with 11 females and 33 males. Fifty-five percent of patients had prior chemotherapy, 86% had prior surgery to the primary site, and 9% had prior surgery to the lung. Tumor volumes ranged from 0.06 to 3166 cc (mean 119.5). Patients were treated with 400-900 cGy per fraction (median 800) in 3-8 fractions (median 5) for a total dose of 2000-4500 cGy (median 4000). Cancers were radiographically evaluated with contrast CT and/or MRI studies and reviewed independently by radiologists. Control of the treated cancer is defined as cessation of growth, shrinkage, or disappearance of the cancer after treatment. Result(s): Follow up ranged from 1 to 59 months (mean 12) with an overall control rate of 97%. Two of the 77 lung metastases did not respond to radiosurgery. By dose, volume, age, sex, and prior treatment, there was no statistically significant difference in outcome. Conclusion(s): Radiosurgery for metastatic RCC to the lung offers a generally well-tolerated, noninvasive treatment method with a high rate of tumor control. Patients will continue to be evaluated for longer follow-up, possible benefits of metastatic cancer treatment and survival advantage. HFSR remains an option for those whom standard approaches have not produced desired results or in patients seeking an alternative to surgical or chemotherapeutic treatment.",Excluded

Controls (HCT survivors without CVD) were matched on age, year of HCT, type of HCT, and duration of follow-up. Sixty-three patients with late CVD were identified, 44 (69.8%) with a coronary artery event and 19 (30.2%) with a cerebrovascular event. Median age at HCT was 49.0 years. Median age at onset of late CVD was 54.0 years; 66.7% of the affected patients had undergone autologous HCT. Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that the presence of multiple cardiovascular risk factors (2 or more of the following: obesity, dyslipidemia, hypertension, and diabetes) after HCT was associated with a 5.2-fold increased risk of late CVD (P < .01), and that pre-HCT chest radiation exposure was associated with a 9.5-fold greater risk of coronary artery disease (P = .03). Pre-HCT exposure to chest radiation and the presence of comorbidities were primarily responsible for the risk associated with late CVD after HCT. These data form the basis for developing predictive models for identifying high-risk individuals for targeted surveillance and aggressive management of comorbidities. © 2010 American Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation.",Excluded
2514,"Brachytherapy in lip carcinoma: Long-term results Purpose: The aim of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of low-dose-rate brachytherapy for local control and relapse-free survival in squamous cell and basal cell carcinomas of the lips. We compared two groups: one with tumors on the skin and the other with tumors on the lip. Patients and Methods: All patients had been treated at Claudius Regaud Cancer Centre from 1990 to 2008 for squamous cell or basal cell carcinoma. Low-dose-rate brachytherapy was performed with iridium 192 wires according to the Paris system rules. On average, the dose delivered was 65 Gy. Result(s): 172 consecutive patients were included in our study; 69 had skin carcinoma (squamous cell or basal cell), and 92 had squamous cell mucosal carcinoma. The average follow-up time was 5.4 years. In the skin cancer group, there were five local recurrences and one lymph node recurrence. In the mucosal cancer group, there were ten local recurrences and five lymph node recurrences. The 8-year relapse-free survival for the entire population was 80%. The 8-year relapse-free survival was 85% for skin carcinoma 75% for mucosal carcinoma, with no significant difference between groups. The functional results were satisfactory for 99% of patients, and the cosmetic results were satisfactory for 92%. Maximal toxicity observed was Grade 2. Conclusion(s): Low-dose-rate brachytherapy can be used to treat lip carcinomas at Stages T1 and T2 as the only treatment with excellent results for local control and relapse-free survival. The benefits of brachytherapy are also cosmetic and functional, with 91% of patients having no side effects. © 2011 Elsevier Inc.",Excluded
277,"Intestinal and colonic motor alterations associated with irradiation-induced diarrhoea in rats Localized application of ionizing radiation to the gastrointestinal tract frequently elicits responses, which include diarrhoea. The origin of this symptom is not clear but has been attributed to loss of epithelial integrity, together with alterations in motility and increased secretion. The purpose of this study was to examine whether a 10 Gy abdominal gamma irradiation leads to an inflammatory reaction, and to compare intestinal and colonic motility in controls and abdominally irradiated rats 1, 3 and 7 days after irradiation, using an electromyographic technique. The motility parameters analysed were the frequency and velocity of propagation of migrating myoelectric complexes (MMC) in the jejunum and colonic spike activity (long spike bursts; LSB) per 10 min in fasted rats. The MMC frequency was significantly reduced on days 1 and 7 after irradiation and the MMC pattern was markedly disrupted on day 3. The frequency of colonic LSB was significantly reduced on days 1, 3 and 7. Mouth to anus transit was significantly accelerated on day 3 only and diarrhoea was observed at this time. Myeloperoxidase activity in the jejunum and colon was also increased on this day only. It is concluded that irradiation-induced diarrhoea occurs contemporaneously with disruption of MMC in the small intestine.",Included
2163,"Impacts of ionising radiation on sperm quality, DNA integrity and post-fertilisation development in marine and freshwater crustaceans Crustaceans have been designated as internationally important model organisms in the development of environmental radioprotection measures. Despite the known sensitivity of sperm to ionizing radiation, the impacts of chronic radiation exposure on male fertility in crustaceans have not been studied. For the first time, the present study aimed to assess the impacts of chronic radiation exposure on male fertility, sperm DNA damage and concomitant impacts on breeding in two amphipod crustaceans. Echinogammarus marinus and Gammarus pulex (male fertility only) were exposed to phosphorus-32 at dose rates of 0, 0.1, 1 and 10mGy/d and sperm parameters, DNA damage and knock-on impacts on breeding were assessed. Sperm quality parameters and DNA damage were assessed using a fluorescent staining method and single cell gel electrophoresis respectively. Concomitant effects of male exposure to radiation on fecundity were determined by pairing phosphorus-32 exposed males to unexposed sexually mature females. In E. marinus, a statistically significant reduction of 9 and 11% in the quality of sperm was recorded at dose rates of 1 and 10mGy/d respectively, with no significant effects recorded on sperm counts. Conversely in the freshwater G. pulex, no significant impact of radiation on sperm quantity or quality was recorded. For E. marinus, a statistically significant increase in DNA damage was recorded at doses of 10mGy/d. Reduced fecundity and an increase in the frequency of abnormal embryos was recorded in female E. marinus breeding with males exposed to radiation. These findings suggest sperm quality may be a sensitive indicator of radiation exposure in invertebrates with potential impacts on the unexposed embryo, though unclear dose-response and differences between two closely related species necessitate further study before robust conclusions can be drawn.

846,"31P NMR spectroscopy can predict the optimum interval between fractionated irradiation doses This study was performed to clarify whether changes in the metabolites observed by phosphorous-31 magnetic resonance spectroscopy (31P-MRS) could indicate an optimum interval between two doses of radiation in a murine tumor model. Murine mammary carcinoma cells, FM3A, were irradiated 7 days after transplantation with a single 5 Gy dose without anesthesia. 31P spectra were measured with a spectrometer up to 30 days. The beta-ATP/Pi and PCr/Pi values were calculated from the peak area of each spectrum. In a fractionation experiment, two fractions of irradiation at a 5 Gy per fraction were given at 0, 1, 2, 3 and 6 day intervals. Tumor growth delay was also scored to determine the fractionated radiation effect. In the control group, beta-ATP/Pi and PCr/Pi decreased with tumor growth. In the single irradiation group, the tumor did not grow up to day 6, and an initial rise and subsequent decrease in beta-ATP/Pi and PCr/Pi were observed. Maximum beta-ATP/Pi and PCr/Pi were observed on day 2 after irradiation. In a fractionation experiment, the greatest growth delay was observed in the two day interval group, in which maximum beta-ATP/Pi and PCr/Pi were demonstrated in 31P-MRS. Our results suggested that changes in the metabolites observed by 31P-MRS could be useful indicators for determining the fractionation schedule in radiation therapy.",Excluded

3234,"Safety and Feasibility of Performing Fenestrated Endovascular Abdominal Aneurysm Repair Using a Portable C-arm Without Fusion Technology: A Single-Center Experience Objective Most centers performing fenestrated endovascular aneurysm repair (F-EVAR) use hybrid rooms with fusion technology for mapping. We present our experience of successfully performing F-EVAR using C-arm without fusion technology. Methods During the period of January 2016 to October 2018, data were collected from a prospectively maintained F-EVAR database at our tertiary care institute. The primary endpoint was technical success, and the secondary outcomes measured were short- and midterm clinical success (both defined by the Society for Vascular Surgery reporting standards), blood loss, radiation dose, operative time, postoperative endoleaks, aneurysm rupture, endograft patency, and complications. Results We performed 11 F-EVARs during the study period in five (45.5%) males and six (54.5%) females, with a mean age of 75+8 years. All procedures were performed under general anesthesia using OEC 9900 Elite Mobile C-arm (GE Healthcare, Chicago, IL, USA) without the use of fusion technology. Three patients had planned preoperative open procedures for access due to prior cutdown or bypass. Technical success was achieved in all 11 (100%) cases. The mean length of stay was 5+2 days, and the mean follow-up was 7.5+6.5 months. The mean procedure time was 301+167 minutes, and the mean blood loss was 361+233 mL. Mean fluoroscopy time was 72+31 minutes, and the mean radiation exposure time was 2,160+930 mGy. No patients required intraoperative transfusion. Thirty-day (short term) clinical success was achieved in 10 (90.0%), cases whereas six-month (midterm) clinical success was achieved in 7 (77.7%) patients. Branch vessel patency was 11 (100%) at 30 days and 9 (81.8%) at six months, and primary endograft patency was 100% (11) at six months. We had no perioperative mortality or major adverse cardiac event at 30 days. Thirty-day postoperative morbidity included readmission for pulmonary edema from cardiac failure in one patient. Two patients had clinically insignificant silent cardiac enzyme elevation. Three patients had re-interventions performed during the mean follow-up period. Two patients developed renal stent thrombosis resulting in renal insufficiency, which is defined as an increase in creatinine concentration >=0.5 mg/dL, without the need for dialysis. One type II endoleak was identified postoperatively that required trans-lumbar embolization. No type I or III endoleaks were identified during the study period. Asymptomatic common femoral artery thrombosis was seen on follow-up imaging in one patient. Conclusions We conclude that F-EVAR can be safely performed using C-arm without the use of fusion technology. Its utility can be expanded to centers with appropriate skill set but no hybrid technology. Copyright © 2020, Juneja et al.",Excluded

999,"Oblique corpectomy for treatment of cervical spine epidural abscesses: Report on four cases Background Spinal epidural abscesses (SEAs) in cervical locations are particularly life-threatening. Currently, SEAs are widely treated with bony decompression, followed by internal stabilization in purulent osteomyelitis. However, recently, a growing number of studies have reported minimally invasive approaches without internal fixation. Purpose We describe four patients with cervical SEAs that were evacuated by oblique corpectomy (OC) without fusion. Methods This study included two women and two men (aged 44-90) that received operations for removing ventral cervical SEAs. All patients presented with progressively increasing myelopathy, and 3 had severe comorbid conditions. In all cases, a multilevel OC without fusion was performed. The amount of bone resection was tailored to fit the needs of granulation removal, with an effort to retain as much of the vertebral bodies as possible. Then, pus was evacuated and debridement of granulation was performed, followed by rinsing and drainage. Results The neurological status of 3 patients improved significantly after surgery. At the last follow-up examination, one showed full recovery, and in two a minor residual deficit persisted. During mean follow-up of 5.5 years, no internal stabilization was necessary. The oldest patient was tetraplegic, and had several concomitant diseases. That patient died from sudden cardiac arrest on the third postoperative day. Oblique corpectomy did not affect the anterior or posterior column. Additionally, it provided a broad view of the ventral aspect of the spinal canal. Conclusions Oblique corpectomy allows appropriate spinal cord decompression and granulation removal in the case of cervical spine epidural abscess, without sacrificing spinal stability.Copyright © 2016",Excluded

780,"The pattern and time course of somatosensory changes in the human UVB sunburn model reveal the presence of peripheral and central sensitization The ultraviolet B (UVB) sunburn model was characterized with a comprehensive battery of quantitative sensory testing (QST). Primary hyperalgesia in UVB-irradiated skin and secondary hyperalgesia in adjacent nonirradiated skin were studied in 22 healthy subjects 24h after irradiation with UVB at 3-fold minimal erythema dose of a skin area 5 cm in diameter at the thigh and compared to mirror-image contralateral control areas. The time course of hyperalgesia over 96 h was studied in a subgroup of 12 subjects. Within the sunburn area, cold hyperesthesia (P=.01), profound generalized hyperalgesia to heat (P<.001), cold (P<.05), pinprick and pressure (P<.001), and mild dynamic mechanical allodynia (P<.001) were present. The finding of cold hyperalgesia and cold hyperesthesia is new in this model. The sunburn was surrounded by large areas of pinprick hyperalgesia (mean+/-SEM, 218+/-32 cm(2)) and a small rim of dynamic mechanical allodynia but no other sensory changes. Although of smaller magnitude, secondary hyperalgesia and dynamic mechanical allodynia adjacent to the UVB-irradiated area were statistically highly significant. Primary and secondary hyperalgesia developed in parallel within hours, peaked after 24-32 h, and lasted for more than 96 h. These data reveal that the UVB sunburn model activates a broad spectrum of peripheral and central sensitization mechanisms and hence is a useful human surrogate model to be used as a screening tool for target engagement in phases 1 and 2a of drug development.

2325,"A randomized trial comparing dual axis rotational versus conventional coronary angiography in a population with a high prevalence of coronary artery disease OBJECTIVES: To compare the safety, radiation dose, and contrast volume between dual axis rotational coronary angiography (DARCA) and conventional coronary angiography (CCA)., BACKGROUND: CCA is performed in multiple, predefined stationary views, at different angulations around the patient, for both the left and right coronary arteries. DARCA (AlluraXperSwing TM, Philips, the Netherlands) involves a pre-set rotation of the C-arm around the patient and allows for the visualization of each coronary artery in different views, using a single automatic pump contrast injection., METHODS: From November 2012 to February 2013, 201 patients were randomly assigned to either CCA (n = 100) or DARCA (n = 101). Exclusion criteria included acute coronary syndrome (ACS), prior PCI or CABG. CCAs were performed in 4 acquisition runs for the left coronary artery and 2 to 3 acquisition runs for the right coronary artery, whereas DARCAs were performed in a single run for each coronary artery., RESULTS: Baseline demographics and clinical characteristics were similar for both groups. The overall prevalence of CAD was 77.6%. The DARCA group had a significant reduction in the amount of contrast, 60 ml (IQR: 52.5-71.5 ml) versus 76 ml (IQR: 68-87 ml), P < 0.0001; and radiation dose by Air Kerma, 269.5 mGy (IQR: 176-450.5) versus 542.1 mGy (IQR: 370.7-720.8), P < 0.0001. There were fewer patients requiring additional projections in the DARCA group: 54.0% versus 75.0%; P = 0.002., CONCLUSIONS: In a population with a high prevalence of CAD, DARCA was safe and resulted in a significant decrease in contrast volume and radiation dose.

3372,"Late Effects of Head and Neck Radiotherapy on Pulp Vitality Assessed by Pulse Oximetry INTRODUCTION: Radiation therapy (RT) of malignant tumors in the head and neck area may have damaging effects on surrounding tissues. The aim of this investigation was to evaluate the long-term effects of ionizing radiation on pulp vitality by measuring pulp oxygenation levels (%SpO2) in patients with history of RT of intraoral and oropharyngeal tumors 4-6 years after treatment., METHODS: In an experimental group RT (n = 90, history of RT) and a control group CON (n = 90, no history of RT), pulp vitality was assessed by measuring %SpO2 by using pulse oximetry and pulp sensitivity by cold thermal testing. All anterior teeth without history of endodontic therapy of the participants in group RT were measured (n = 693), regardless of the quadrant and the irradiated area. An equal number of anterior teeth were tested in group CON., RESULTS: There was no significant difference between the %SpO2 levels in group RT (92.7%; standard deviation, +/- 1.83) and group CON (92.6%; standard deviation, +/- 1.80). All teeth in RT and CON groups showed a positive response to the thermal test. All tested teeth were considered vital., CONCLUSIONS: Pulp %SpO2 was found to be within normal limits 4-6 years after RT. This suggests that RT may not have a long-term influence on pulp vitality, and reported short-term changes in pulpal microcirculation because of RT may be temporary.

1920,"Time trend of patient setup deviations during pelvic irradiation using electronic portal imaging An electronic portal imaging device (EPID) was used to detect patient setup displacement during the course of a 3-field pelvic irradiation of two groups of patients: 10 rectal and 10 prostate carcinomas. These patients were irradiated with conventional treatment techniques in routine clinical practice. A total of 469 portal images and 60 simulator films were used to determine the values of setup deviations in the X- Y- and Z-directions of a fixed coordinate system, corresponding to the medio-lateral, cranio-caudal and antero-posterior direction, respectively. The absolute displacement averaged over all setups and patients ranged between 0.4 mm and 1.4 mm with a standard deviation (S.D.) of 1.6-3.9 mm. The overall distribution along each direction could be separated into a distribution of random deviations (S.D.s ranging from 1.2 to 2.8 mm) around the mean deviation of each patient and a distribution of the means themselves: the distribution of systematic deviations (S.D.s ranging from 1.0 to 2.6 mm). Significant gradual displacement as a function of time was detected in 5 out of the 20 patients, 2 in the rectum and 3 in the prostate group. This ""time trend"" was found along each of the 3 directions specified. The magnitude of the time-dependent displacement throughout the course of treatment ranged between 4 and 11 mm. It can be concluded that for treatments requiring a high level of precision, portal images should be made and analyzed during the whole treatment course in order to detect and correct significant time trends.",Excluded
2937,"Autosomal recessive cerebellar ataxia with oculomotor apraxia (ataxia-telangiectasia-like syndrome) is linked to chromosome 9q34 Ataxia with oculomotor apraxia (ataxia-telangiectasia-like syndrome [AOA]; MIM 208920) is an autosomal recessive disorder characterized by ataxia, oculomotor apraxia, and choreoathetosis. These neurological features resemble those of ataxia-telangiectasia (AT), but in AOA there are none of the extraneurological features of AT, such as immunodeficiency, neoplasia, chromosomal instability, or sensitivity to ionizing radiation. It is unclear whether these patients have a true disorder of chromosomal instability or a primary neurodegenerative syndrome, and it has not been possible to identify the defective gene in AOA, since the families have been too small for linkage analysis. We have identified a new family with AOA, and we show that the patients have no evidence of chromosomal instability or sensitivity to ionizing radiation, suggesting that AOA in this family is a true primary cerebellar ataxia. We have localized the disease gene, by linkage analysis and homozygosity mapping, to a 15.9-cM interval on chromosome 9q34. This work will ultimately allow the disease gene to be identified and its relevance to other types of autosomal recessive cerebellar ataxias to be determined.",Excluded

The purpose of this prospective study was to compare the performance of standard-dose MDCT with that of low-dose MDCT with tube current modulation in patients with renal colic. SUBJECTS AND METHODS. Three hundred patients underwent 6- and 16-MDCT in 150 standard-dose examinations (6-MDCT effective tube current, 95 mAs at 130 kV; 16-MDCT effective tube current, 120 mAs at 120 kV) and 150 low-dose examinations (6-MDCT effective tube current, 51 mAs at 110 kV; 16-MDCT effective tube current, 70 mAs at 120 kV), all performed with 4D tube current modulation. Two experienced radiologists using a clinical workstation and blinded to scan parameters prospectively viewed the images from the 300 examinations. In a second session, one experienced radiologist and two first-year residents using a clinical workstation retrospectively reviewed images from 100 randomly selected standard-dose and 100 randomly selected low-dose examinations. RESULTS. Tube current modulation reduced effective tube current 25-31% in all examinations. Mean effective dose was 1.41-1.58 mSv for low-dose examinations, which reached additional dose reduction of 51.2-64.3% in comparison with standard-dose examinations. Excellent correlation existed between mean tube current and body mass index of the patients. Spearman's correlation coefficient was 0.85-0.88 for all examinations. The sensitivity of low-dose examinations interpreted by two experienced reviewers was 97.3-98.6%; specificity, 93.5%; and accuracy, 95.3%. These findings were comparable with those for standard-dose examinations. Sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of low-dose examinations of overweight and obese patients reached similar high values: 97-100%, 100%, and 98-100%, respectively. Interobserver agreement for urinary stone detection was excellent between the two reviewers, with kappa values of 0.98 for the low-dose and 0.96 for the standard-dose examinations. An alternative diagnosis was identified in 15% and 16% of cases by two experienced radiologists in the two examinations groups. In the second interpretation session, the residents found an alternative diagnosis in only 10-12% of standard-dose examinations and only 4-5% of low-dose examinations. CONCLUSION. Low-dose MDCT with tube current modulation can be used as standard procedure in evaluation for urolithiasis, even in overweight and obese patients. © American Roentgen Ray Society.",Excluded
1785,"Factors influencing the degree of erythematous skin reactions in humans Dose-response relationships have been studied using an ordinal visual scale and reflectance spectrophotometry data from 123 treatment sites on 110 patients treated with 10 dose fractions over 12-14 days. Dose rates varied between 3 and 240 Gy/h and total doses of between 25 and 41 Gy were given using teletherapy apparatus. We found qualitative scoring of erythematous skin reactions to be subject to considerable inter- and intra-observer variation. Reflectance spectrophotometry provided more reproducible information, some of which was undetectable by naked eye. Baseline erythema readings were significantly higher in male patients and at anatomical sites of previous heavy UV exposure. In addition, a pronounced decline in erythema readings during the second week of therapy and 'reciprocal vicinity' (abscopal) effects adjacent to the field, undetected by the eye, were observed in a subset of patients. Meaningful dose-response relationships could be derived only from reflectance data with peak change from the pretreatment baseline measure providing the best discrimination. Peak erythema measures following treatment were found to depend on the age and gender of the patient as well as the treatment site and its baseline erythema measurement. This was independent of the total dose administered or the instantaneous dose rate at which it was delivered. The rate of erythema development was also dose rate dependent but only weakly dependent on the biological dose intensity (Gy equiv./day) of the treatment course. The data raise the question of whether irradiation-induced erythema is exclusively a secondary phenomenon occurring as a result of basal cell killing. The short repair half time value of 0.06 h obtained by direct analysis is perplexing and may reflect a dose rate-dependent physiological vasodilatory response to irradiation and/or a multi-component cellular repair process.",Excluded

However, the prognostic value of PET/CT metrics in LS-SCLC is not clear. Method(s): Subjects in this retrospective study were 50 patients with LS-SCLC who had had PET/CT before definitive chemoradiation therapy in January 2003 to August 2009; 15 (29%) had also had induction chemotherapy. Median radiation dose was 45 Gy (range, 40.5 to 61.8 Gy). All scans were read and scored by 1 radiologist. Kaplan-Meier curves were used to estimate survival outcomes, and Cox regression analysis was used to evaluate the prognostic value of pretreatment standardized uptake values (SUVs) with regard to locoregional control (LRC) and overall survival (OS). Result(s): At a median follow-up time of 18.2 months (range, 2.1 to 78 mo), LRC rates were 64% at 2 and 3 years; OS rates were 81% at 2 years and 61% at 3 years. None of the metrics assessed (receipt of induction chemotherapy, pretreatment SUV primary, SUVnodal, meanSUVmax) was associated with LRC or OS, but patients with residual SUV<=5.5 after treatment had a 3-year OS rate of 69% versus 34% for those with SUV>5.5. Conclusion(s): Pretreatment PET/CT metrics had no prognostic significance for patients with LS-SCLC, perhaps because of the rapid proliferation of SCLC or other confounding factors affecting survival.

795,"Baseline analysis of use of denosumab in osteoporotic patients: Indications, compliance, adverse effect and tolerability Background Denosumab is a fully human monoclonal antibody that inhibits osteoclast activity, reducing bone loss. In the UK, use of denosumab was approved by National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) from October 2010 (TA204) [1]. Denosumab was used in Rheumatology Department, Queen Elizabeth Hospital, London from October 2010. Objectives We audited the indications for use of denosumab in these patients. Drug compliance, adverse effect and tolerability of the drug were also analysed. Methods 81 patients (female 77, male 4, age range 52 to 92 years, mean age 72 years) who commenced denosumab between October 2010 and December 2011 were identified retrospectively. 97% (79/81) of the patients come from their own home and 3% (2/81) come from nursing home. Patients' demographics, risk factors, fracture history, bone mineral density (BMD), spine and hip T score and previous osteoporosis treatment were assessed. 58 patients had follow up data and renal function was monitored every six months. Side effects were documented. Results Pre-treatment Dual-emission X-ray Absorptiometry (DXA) was available on all patients (mean BMD spine and hip 0.686 gm/cm2 and 0.705 gm/cm2, mean T score spine and hip -3.025 and -1.776). 87% (75/81) had failed treatment with both oral and intravenous bisphosphonates. 11% (9/81) had breast cancer and were on aromatase inhibitors. 16% (13/81) had mild renal impairment and 7% (6/81) had moderate renal impairment at the base line. 35.8% (29/81) of patients were found to have vitamin D deficiency at baseline and were treated. 9% (7/81) were on denosumab treatment for primary prevention of osteoporosis (T score range -2.3 to -4.1). All of these had failed oral medication previously. Four patients swapped from intravenous Ibandronate due to poor venous access. Use of denosumab was indicated clinically despite lack of specific risk factors suggested by NICE.

276,"Treatment of locally advanced, high-grade, malignant tumors of major salivary glands A retrospective review of 45 patients with Stage III and IV malignant tumors of the major salivary glands was undertaken to determine tumor control and patient survival after treatment with surgery and conventional ionizing-radiation therapy. Eight of the 23 patients received early postoperative radiotherapy after initial surgical resection, with a local control rate of 75%. Twelve of 23 patients had surgery as definitive treatment and the tumor recurred locally in all; seven of these 12 patients were subsequently salvaged by further surgery plus postoperative radiotherapy or by radiotherapy alone, with 58% ultimate local control. The remaining three patients had unresectable tumors at diagnosis and received radiation alone, with a local tumor control rate of 33%. Patients were also analyzed according to the extent of surgical resection prior to radiation therapy and according to radiation dose. Eighty-eight percent of completely resected, 50% of partially resected, and 44% of unresected tumors were locally controlled for an overall local control rate of 61%. The 5-year survival rate was significantly higher for patients with local tumor control than for patients who failed locally (31% vs. 0%).",Excluded
2385,"Doses to carotid arteries after modern radiation therapy for hodgkin lymphoma: Is stroke still a late effect of treatment? Purpose Hodgkin lymphoma (HL) survivors are at an increased risk of stroke because of carotid artery irradiation. However, for early-stage HL involved node radiation therapy (INRT) reduces the volume of normal tissue exposed to high doses. Here, we evaluate 3-dimensional conformal radiation therapy (3D-CRT), volumetric-modulated arc therapy (VMAT), and proton therapy (PT) delivered as INRT along with the extensive mantle field (MF) by comparing doses to the carotid arteries and corresponding risk estimates. Methods and Materials We included a cohort of 46 supradiaphragmatic stage I-II classical HL patients. All patients were initially treated with chemotherapy and INRT delivered as 3D-CRT (30 Gy). For each patient, we simulated MF (36 Gy) and INRT plans using VMAT and PT (30 Gy). Linear dose-response curves for the 20-, 25-, and 30-year risk of stroke were derived from published HL data. Risks of stroke with each technique were calculated for all patients. Statistical analyses were performed with repeated measures analysis of variance. Results The mean doses to the right and left common carotid artery were significantly lower with modern treatment compared with MF, with substantial patient variability. The estimated excess risk of stroke after 20, 25, and 30 years was 0.6%, 0.86%, and 1.3% for 3D-CRT; 0.67%, 0.96%, and 1.47% for VMAT; 0.61%, 0.96%, and 1.33% for PT; and 1.3%, 1.72%, and 2.61% for MF. Conclusions INRT reduces the dose delivered to the carotid arteries and corresponding estimated risk of stroke for HL survivors. Even for the subset of patients with lymphoma close to the carotid arteries, the estimated risk is low. © 2013 Elsevier Inc.",Excluded
2131,"Inflammatory disease and C-reactive protein in relation to therapeutic ionising radiation exposure in the US Radiologic Technologists Chronic inflammation underlies many autoimmune diseases, including hypothyroidism, hyperthyroidism, and rheumatoid arthritis, also type-2 diabetes and osteoarthritis. Associations have been suggested of high-dose ionising radiation exposure with type-2 diabetes and elevated levels of C-reactive protein, a marker of chronic inflammation. In this analysis we used a proportional hazards model to assess effects of radiotherapy on risks of subsequent inflammatory disease morbidity in 110,368 US radiologic technologists followed from a baseline survey (1983-1989/1994-1998) through 2008. We used a linear model to assess log-transformed C-reactive protein concentration following radiotherapy in 1326 technologists. Relative risk of diabetes increased following radiotherapy (p < 0.001), and there was a borderline significant increasing trend per treatment (p = 0.092). For osteoarthritis there was increased relative risk associated with prior radiotherapy on all questionnaires (p = 0.005), and a significant increasing trend per previous treatment (p = 0.024). No consistent increases were observed for other types of inflammatory disease (hypothyroidism, hyperthyroidism, rheumatoid arthritis) associated with radiotherapy. There was a borderline significant (p = 0.059) increasing trend with dose for C-reactive protein with numbers of prior radiotherapy treatments. Our results suggest that radiotherapy is associated with subsequent increased risk of certain inflammatory conditions, which is reinforced by our finding of elevated levels of C-reactive protein.",Included

While MTG16 loss renders mice sensitive to chemicalcolitis, the role of MTG16 in the small intestine is unknown. Histologicalexamination revealed that Mtg16-/- mice have increasedenterocyte proliferation and goblet cell deficiency. After exposure toradiation, Mtg16-/- mice exhibited increased crypt viability anddecreased apoptosis compared with wild-type (WT) mice. Flow cytometricand immunofluorescence analysis of intestinal epithelial cellsfor phospho-histone H2A.X also indicated decreased DNA damageand apoptosis in Mtg16-/- intestines. To determine if Mtg16 deletionaffected epithelial cells in a cell-autonomous fashion, intestinal cryptswere isolated from Mtg16-/- mice. Mtg16-/-and WT intestinalcrypts showed similar enterosphere forming efficiencies when culturedin the presence of EGF, Noggin, and R-spondin. However, whenMtg16-/- crypts were cultured in the presence of Wnt3a, theydemonstrated higher enterosphere forming efficiencies and delayedprogression to mature enteroids. Mtg16-/- intestinal crypts isolatedfrom irradiated mice exhibited increased survival compared with WTintestinal crypts. Interestingly, Mtg16 expression was reduced in astem cell-enriched population at the time of crypt regeneration. Thisis consistent with MTG16 negatively regulating regeneration in vivo.Taken together, our data demonstrate that MTG16 loss promotesradioresistance and impacts intestinal stem cell function, possibly dueto shifting cellular response away from DNA damage-induced apoptosisand towards DNA repair after injury.Copyright © 2015 the American Physiological Society.",Included
3314,"Mouse spleen lymphocyte bactericidal and peroxidase activities: enhancement by whole body x-irradiation A 20,000 g pellet obtained from the homogenate of CD1 mouse spleen cells has measurable peroxidase and bactericidal activities. Whole body x-irradiation stimulates the in vitro peroxidative and bactericidal activities of the spleen cells. These cells do not phagocytize. However, addition of polystyrene latex particles to spleen cells from non- or x-irradiated mice, increases glucose oxidation. The extent of this stimulation (three- to fourfold) is less than that of PMN (six- to tenfold). Interaction between particles and lymphocyte surface may be the cause of this stimulation. The increased bactericidal activity due to x-ray is attributed mainly to an increase in the peroxidase activity of the lymphocytes. Surface (membrane) action rather than phagocytosis may be involved in the bactericidal process. The spleen lymphocyte peroxidase is distinct from myeloperoxidase in several respects.",Included
765,"Sonographic characterisation of radiation-induced carotid artery stenosis BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: To study the distribution, extent and sonographic characterisation of radiation-induced carotid artery stenosis in nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) patients., METHODS: The distribution of plaques, the extent of stenosis, and the sonographic characterisation of the plaque at maximum stenosis were recorded in 71 NPC patients. The results were compared with the ultrasound results of a control group of 142 patients presenting with symptoms of cerebrovascular disease or carotid bruit., RESULTS: NPC patients had a higher incidence of carotid stenosis (77 vs. 50.7%). The common carotid arteries were most commonly affected by radiation-induced stenosis (93/142 vs. 37/284 in the control group), whereas the carotid bulb was the most commonly affected (56/284) site in the control group. Significantly more NPC patients had moderate-to-severe stenosis (21/71 vs. 27/142). Analysis of the sonographic appearance of radiation-induced and atherosclerotic plaques showed more diffuse involvement in the post-radiation group. Non-calcified plaques and intraplaque hypoechoic foci were also more frequent in the post-radiation group., CONCLUSIONS: Radiation-induced carotid stenosis is more diffuse in distribution, is associated with more severe luminal stenosis and has different sonographic plaque characterisation compared with carotid stenosis without radiation exposure.

3636,"Assessment of liver fibrosis with acoustic radiation force impulse imaging versus liver histology in patients with chronic hepatitis C: a pilot study BACKGROUND: Acoustic radiation force impulse imaging (ARFI) involves the mechanical excitation of tissues using short-duration acoustic pulses to generate localized displacements in tissue. The displacements results in shear-wave propagation, tracked by ultrasonography (US) correlation-based methods and recorded in meters per seconds., AIM: To compare (ARFI) integrated into a conventional US with the standard histological examination of liver biopsy specimens for the assessment of liver fibrosis., MATERIALS AND METHODS: Histological fibrosis staging with standard liver biopsy using the Metavir scoring system as well as fibrosis assessment using ARFI were performed to 80 patients with chronic hepatitis C over a 3-month period., RESULTS: ARFI findings were identical to the biopsy findings in 61 (76.25%) patients.Fifty-eight (67.5%) patients with an early fibrosis stage (F0, F1, and F2) by histology had identical fibrosis stages using ARFI.Only 20 out of 26 patients with an advanced fibrosis stage (F3 and F4) using ARFI had advanced fibrosis histologically. In the advanced fibrosis stages, the sensitivity of ARFI was 70% and specificity was 80%, with positive and negative predictive values of 53.8 and 88.9%, respectively.

2559,"Efficacy of sonography as a guidance technique for biopsy of abdominal, pelvic, and retroperitoneal lymph nodes OBJECTIVE: In the United States, CT is generally considered the guidance technique of choice for biopsy of abdominal, pelvic, and retroperitoneal lymph nodes. The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of sonography for this purpose., SUBJECTS AND METHODS: We attempted 26 sonographically guided biopsies of five abdominal, six pelvic, and 12 retroperitoneal lymph nodes in 23 patients. The patients included 19 women and four men who were 26-76 years old (mean, 50 years old). The nodes were less than 2 cm in 16 patients, 2-3 cm in four patients, and greater than 3 cm in three patients. Biopsies were considered successful if the nodes could be visualized and biopsied using sonographic guidance and the pathologist's final report indicated that the tissue specimens obtained were adequate for diagnosis. The length of the procedures and the number of complications were recorded., RESULTS: Lymph nodes were visualized and biopsied with sonographic guidance in 23 (88%) of the 26 attempts. Three biopsies could not be performed with sonography because of poor visualization of the nodes. Adequate tissue for cytologic or histologic evaluation was obtained in 21 (91%) of the 23 sonographically guided procedures. In the 21 successful procedures, clinical and imaging follow-up showed no evidence of false-negative diagnoses. The time from the placement of the patient in the interventional sonography room to completion of the procedure ranged from 25 to 60 min (mean, 35 min) for sonographically guided biopsies. We had no procedure-related complications., CONCLUSION: Sonography is an accurate and safe guidance technique for lymph node biopsies in the abdomen, pelvis, and retroperitoneum. This technique is efficacious for deep nodes as small as 1 cm in diameter. The advantages of sonography over CT include no need for ionizing radiation, portability, shorter procedure time, and real-time visualization of the needle throughout the procedure. These advantages, and the fact that sonography costs less than CT, suggest that sonography is a more appropriate guidance technique in this era of cost containment.",Excluded
1572,"Treatment of posterolateral tibial plateau fractures with a rotational support plate and special pressurizer: technical note and retrospective case series BACKGROUND: In tibial plateau fractures, the posterolateral segment of the tibia plateau is frequently affected and challenging to treat. Although there are many surgical approaches and fixation methods for the treatment of these fractures, all of these methods have limitations. We designed a new rotational support plate (RSP) and a special pressurizer that can fix the fracture directly via the anterolateral approach. This method is advantageous because it leads to little trauma, involves a simple operation, and has a reliable fixation effect. This study details the technique of treating these fractures with the RSP and special pressurizer and provides the outcomes. METHOD(S): From May 2016 to January 2019, the data of 12 patients with posterolateral tibial plateau fractures treated with the RSP and special pressurizer in our hospital were retrospectively analyzed. Postoperative rehabilitation was advised, knee X-rays were taken at follow-ups, and fracture healing, complications, and knee range of motion were assessed. The Hospital for Special Surgery (HSS) knee score and Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS) were used to evaluate knee function at the last follow-up. RESULT(S): The average follow-up time of all patients was 16.5 months (range, 12-25 months). The average bony union time was 3.2 months (range, 3-4.5 months). At the last follow-up, the average knee range of motion was 138degree (range, 107-145degree). The average HSS score was 91 (range, 64-98). The average KOOS Symptoms score was 90 (range, 75-96). The average KOOS Pain score was 91 (range, 72-97). The average KOOS ADL score was 91 (range, 74-97). The average KOOS sport/recreation score was 83 (range, 70-90). The average KOOS QOL score was 88 (range, 69-93). Skin necrosis, incision infections, and fixation failure did not occur during the follow-up period.

The decision to treat ipsilateral or bilateral draining lymph node is on physician discretion and guidelines do not have a defined indication regarding this. We aimed to analyze the failure patterns and survival in buccal mucosa cancers treated with adjuvant ipsilateral RT. Material(s) and Method(s): One hundred sixteen cases of post-operative buccal mucosa cancers-pT3 or more, node positive, close margins (1-5 mm), lymphovascular invasion positive, perineural invasion positive, depth of invasion >4 mm-treated with RT to primary and ipsilateral nodes from May 2013 to May 2019 were retrospectively analyzed. Patients were treated to a dose of 60-66 Gy (44 Gy in the first phase and a coned down boost of 16-22 Gy in the second phase) with three-dimensional conformal radiotherapy on a linear accelerator. Primary end point was to assess control rates and secondary end point was to evaluate the overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS) out-comes. Result(s): Median age was 46 years with male; female ratio of 110:6. The edition of the American Joint Committee on Cancer stage distributions were I (3.4%), II (34.4%), III (24.1%), and IV (37.9%).

To identify complications associated with tumor-related lipid exudation (TRLE) after plaque radiotherapy of posterior uveal melanoma. Methods. Comparative study including 294 patients with posterior uveal melanoma who developed TRLE after plaque radiotherapy (TRLE group) and 294 patients who did not develop TRLE (non-TRLE group). Patients in the TRLE group were matched with patients in the non-TRLE group for age, gender, and initial tumor thickness. results. The TRLE group was associated with significantly higher incidence of postradiation complications including early transient increase of serous retinal detachment (p<0.001), iris neovascularization (NVI) (p<0.001), neovascular glaucoma (NVG) (p<0.001), posterior synechia (p<0.001), vitreous hemorrhage (p<0.001), subretinal hemorrhage (p<0.001), and retinoschisis (p<0.001). A significant relationship was found between extent of TRLE and NVI (p<0.001), NVG (p<0.001), posterior synechia (p = 0.007), and retinoschisis over tumor (p = 0.010). Radiation-induced retinopathy, maculopathy, and papillopathy were not associated with presence or extent of TRLE. Tumor-related lipid exudation was also associated with worse final visual acuity (p = 0.011), higher rate of secondary enucleation (p<0.001), and lower rate of systemic metastasis (p = 0.006). Conclusions. Tumor-related lipid exudation following plaque radiotherapy of posterior uveal melanoma is associated with major intraocular complications and portends poor prognosis for final visual acuity and eye retention. These findings provide evidence for the presence of 2 distinct pathogenic mechanisms, one radiation-induced and one tumor-related, in development of postradiation complications in eyes with posterior uveal melanoma. © 2013 Wichtig Editore.",Excluded
498,"Estimation of the displacement of cardiac substructures and the motion of the coronary arteries using electrocardiographic gating Purpose: The aim of this study was to quantify the displacement of cardiac substructures, including the anterior myocardial territory (AMT), left ventricle, and coronary arteries during a normal cardiac cycle. Material(s) and Method(s): Computed tomography (CT) images with retrospective electrocardiographic gating of 17 eligible patients were obtained. All images were reconstructed automatically for the end-diastolic and end-systolic phases. CT scanning without contrast at a random phase and a selected vertebral body were used as references to measure three-dimensionaldisplacements of the cardiac substructures. Result(s): The displacement between the end-diastolic and end-systolic phases (Dd-s) was greater than that between the end-systolic and random phases and between the end-diastolic and random cardiac phases. The largest displacements for the heart were in the left, posterior, and inferior directions with an average Dd-s of approximately 4-6 mm. The average Dd-s for the AMT and left ventricle was 1.2-2.7 mm in the anterior and right directions, 4.3-7.8 mm in left and posterior directions, and 4.9-6.3 mm in superior and inferior directions. For the coronary arteries, the average Dd-s was 2.8-5.9 mm in the anterior-posterior direction, 3.5-6.6 mm in left-right direction, and 3.8-5.3 mm in the superior-inferior direction. Inter-observer agreement was excellent for the heart, AMT, and left ventricle (kappa coefficient, >0.75 for all) and good for most coronary arteries in three dimensions (kappa coefficient, 0.511-0.687). The Dd-s did not differ significantly between men and women. Conclusion(s): Most average displacements of the cardiac substructures and coronary arteries were 3-8 mm in three dimensions. These findings will be useful to accurately estimate the radiation dose to cardiac substructures during thoracic radiation and to evaluate the risk of radiation-related heart disease. © 2013 Tan et al.

831,"Computer-Assisted Distal Radius Osteotomy Purpose: To establish the accuracy, precision, and clinical feasibility of a novel technique of computer-assisted distal radius osteotomy for the correction of symptomatic distal radius malunion. Method(s): Six patients underwent a computer-assisted distal radius osteotomy and were followed-up for an average of 25 months. Objective radiographic measurements and functional outcomes, as measured by clinical examination including grip strength and range of motion, and Disability of the Arm, Shoulder and Hand (DASH) questionnaires, were used. Result(s): The mean radiographic parameters included an increase of radial inclination to 21degree from 12degree (normal, 23degree). Dorsal and volar tilt (malunion) were corrected to 9degree from -30degree and 21degree, respectively (normal, 10degree). Ulnar variance was corrected to 1.9 mm from 7.5 mm (normal, +1.5 mm). Normal is defined as the average of the contralateral limb radiographs. The mean clinical outcome measures at an average of 25 months included a DASH global score of 14, a DASH individual item average score of 1.6, and an average affected side grip strength of 79% when compared with the unaffected side. Conclusion(s): The results of the computer-assisted technique were comparable with published results of traditional non-computer-assisted opening wedge osteotomy techniques. This technique allows a surgeon to accurately and precisely recognize and correct 3-dimensional deformities of the distal radius including axial malalignment (supination). The technique has the added benefit of reducing radiation exposure to the patient and surgical team because fluoroscopy is not used during the procedure. Additional benefits of the computer-assisted technique include the ability to perform multiple surgical simulations to optimize the alignment plan, and it serves as an excellent teaching tool for less-experienced surgeons.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Institutional review board approval and informed consent were obtained. The study included 107 patients (62 men, 45 women; mean age, 55 years; range, 22-81 years) with a solitary pulmonary nodule. After unenhanced CT (2.5-mm collimation) scans were obtained, dynamic CT was performed by using a helical technique (series of images obtained throughout the nodule, with 2.5-mm collimation, at 30, 60, 90, and 120 seconds and 4, 5, 9, 12, and 15 minutes) after intravenous injection of contrast medium (120 mL). Tissue diagnosis was made in 70 nodules, and follow-up images showed benignancy in the remaining 37 (no change in size, n = 32; decrease in size, n = 5). CT findings were analyzed in terms of wash-in and washout of contrast medium. Sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy for malignant nodules were calculated by considering both the wash-in and washout characteristics at dynamic CT. RESULT(S): There were 49 malignant and 58 benign nodules. When diagnostic criteria for malignancy of both wash-in of 25 HU or greater and washout of 5-31 HU were applied, sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy for malignancy were 94% (46 of 49 nodules), 90% (52 of 58 nodules), and 92% (98 of 107 nodules), respectively. Of 58 benign nodules, 27 showed less than 25 HU wash-in, 14 showed persistent contrast enhancement without washout and with wash-in of 25 HU or greater, and 11 showed washout greater than 31 HU and wash-in of 25 HU or greater.

2781,"How are patients influenced when counseled for minimally invasive lumbar spine surgeries? A stepwise model assessing pivotal information for decision-making Background Context Although minimally invasive surgery (MIS)-transforaminal lumbar interbody fusion (TLIF) has many evidence-based short-term benefits over open TLIF, both procedures have similar long-term outcomes. Patients' preference for MIS over open TLIF may be confounded by a lack of understanding of what each approach entails. Purpose The study aimed to identify the various factors influencing patients' choice between MIS and open TLIF. Study Design/Setting This is a cross-sectional study conducted at a tertiary health-care institution. Patient Sample Patients, for whom TLIF procedures were indicated, were recruited over a 3-month period from specialist outpatient clinics. Outcome Measure The outcome measure was patients' choice of surgical approach (MIS or open). Methods All patients were subjected to a stepwise interviewing process and were asked to select between open and MIS approaches at each step. Further subgroup analysis stratifying subjects based on stages of decision-making was performed to identify key predictors of selection changes. No sources of funding were required for this study and there are no conflicts of interests. Results Fifty-four patients with a mean age of 55.8 years participated in the study. Thirteen (24.1%) consistently selected a single approach, whereas 31 (57.4%) changed their selection more than once during the interviewing process. Overall, 12 patients (22.2%) had a final decision different from their initial choice, and 15 patients (27.8%) were unable to decide. A large proportion of patients (65.0%) initially favored the open approach's midline incision. This proportion dropped to 16.7% (p<.001) upon mention of the term MIS. The proportion of patients favoring MIS dropped significantly following discussion on the pros and cons (p=.002) of each approach, as well as conversion or revision surgery (p=.017). Radiation and cosmesis were identified as the two most important factors influencing patients' final decisions. Conclusions The longer midline incision of the open approach is cosmetically more appealing to patients than the paramedian stab wounds of MIS. The advantages of the MIS approach may not be as valued by patients as they are by surgeons. Given the equivalent long-term outcomes of both approaches, it is crucial that patients are adequately informed during preoperative counseling to achieve the best consensus decision.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Inc.",Excluded

Immunohistochemistry (IHC) was performed for MIB, Cyclin E, p21, p27, p53, survivin, Bcl-2, and BAX. Immunoreactivity along with clinical variables was subjected to univariate and forward stepwise logistic regression analyses., RESULTS: Pathological complete response (pCR) was 23.9%. The number of positive lymph nodes obtained in the resected specimen was associated with pCR. Immunoreactivity for MIB (Sn 15%, Sp 65%, OR 0.33), p53 (Sn 3%, Sp 84%, OR 0.16), Bcl-2 (Sn 11%, Sp 74%, OR 0.35), and BAX (Sn 92%, Sp 80%, OR 46) was associated with pathological response (all p's<0.001). Forward stepwise logistic regression analysis demonstrated that MIB was an independent predictor of a response to chemoradiation (p=0.001)., CONCLUSIONS: A combined panel of mediators of apoptosis alone or combined with clinical factors is a feasible approach that can be applied to rectal tumor biopsies to predict a response to chemoradiation. The most sensitive factor was BAX; while MIB independently predicted a response to chemoradiation. Copyright Published by Elsevier Ltd.",Excluded

It is not known, however, whether such effects also occur following the lower doses and dose rates of public health concern., METHODS: We used data from an international (15-country) nuclear workers cohort study to evaluate whether mortality from diseases other than cancer is related to low doses of external ionizing radiation. Analyses included 275 312 workers with adequate information on socioeconomic status, over 4 million person-years of follow-up and an average cumulative radiation dose of 20.7 mSv; 11 255 workers had died of non-cancer diseases., RESULTS: The excess relative risk (ERR) per Sv was 0.24 [95% CI (confidence intervals) -0.23, 0.78] for mortality from all non-cancer diseases and 0.09 (95% CI -0.43, 0.70) for circulatory diseases. Higher risk estimates were observed for mortality from respiratory and digestive diseases, but confidence intervals included zero. Increased risks were observed among the younger workers (attained age <50 years, identified post hoc) for all groupings of non-cancer causes of death, including external causes. It is unclear therefore whether these findings reflect real effects of radiation, random variation or residual confounding., CONCLUSIONS: The most informative low-dose radiation study to date provides little evidence for a relationship between mortality from non-malignant diseases and radiation dose. However, we cannot rule out risks per unit dose of the same order of magnitude as found in studies at higher doses.",Included
432,"DNA alterations detected in the progeny of paternally irradiated Japanese medaka fish (Oryzias latipes) A nonmammalian test system for germ-cell mutagenesis has been developed by using the Japanese medaka fish. We describe a system for detecting DNA alterations in F1 progeny descended from the gamma-irradiated male medaka that uses an arbitrarily primed polymerase chain reaction and fingerprinting. A combination of these two methods has some advantages for screening changes in genomic DNA of individual progeny because this detection system can (i) screen for mutational events before embryos with dominant lethal mutations are eliminated during development and (ii) detect DNA changes in the progeny of irradiated males without functional selection and bias, such as resistance to chemicals. DNA alterations are detected as changes in patterns (i.e., band loss and/or band gain) of DNA fingerprints of progeny descended from males whose spermatozoa or spermatids were gamma-irradiated (4.75 or 9.50 Gy). We determined the frequency of gamma-irradiation-induced band loss in arbitrarily primed polymerase chain reaction fingerprints of DNA from severely malformed embryos with dominant lethal mutations and hatched viable embryos. The frequency of band loss in both dominant lethal embryos and hatched viable embryos increased with increasing gamma-ray dose, although more so in the former. We detected a new band in the fingerprints as a heritable DNA alteration but not a viability- or phenotype-affecting DNA alteration in two viable mutants recovered after gamma-irradiation experiments. A cloned amplified fragment of the new band contained a repeated sequence of p(ATGT)n.",Excluded
408,"The usefulness of a prospective ECG gated CT angiography by 256 MDCT: Feasibility and image quality Purpose: To evaluate the usefulness of a prospectively gated transverseaxial scan (PGT) by 256-slice multidetector-row CT (MDCT) coronary angiography compared with a retrospectively gated helical scan (RGH) in patients with atypical chest pain who visited emergency room. Method(s): Between December 2009 and January 2010, among 70 consecutive patients with atypical chest pain who visited ER who performed with 256-slice CT scanner, we included the patients with heart rate (HR) of <= 75 bpm and HR variation <= 10 bpm. Therefore, we included 24 patients obtaining with PGT (mean age, 58.8+/-16.2 years; 12 men and 12 women) and 24 patients obtaining with RGH (mean age, 57.2+/-14.5 years; 12 men and 12 women). Scan was obtained from apex to kidney level. For each of 15 segments indentified according to the American Heart association's segmental model, image quality was evaluated by a radiologist using a four point grading scale: grade 4, excellent and no motion artifacts; grade 3, good and minor stairstep or motion artifacts; grade 2, moderate and presenting artifacts but still diagnostic; and grade 1, poor and not diagnostic. For each scan, radiation dose and additional extracardiac findings were estimated. Diagnostic accuracy was also evaluated the 2 patients performed conventional angiography. The image quality results between PGT and RGH scans were compared using Mann-Whitney Test. Result(s): No statistically significant differences were evident between these two groups in terms of clinical and demographic characteristics. The difference of image quality between PGT and RGH scans was not statistically significant (p = 0.5843). The image quality was regarded as grade 4 for most segments in both PGT (96.7%, 348/360) and RGH scans (98.9%, 356/360). Mean effective radiation dose was 10.4+/-1.2 mSv in patients with PGT as compared to 23.0+/-4.6 mSv in patients with RGH. Additional extracardiac findings are 10 cases in patients with PGT including lung nodule, thyroid nodule. Conclusion(s): Prospective ECG-gated CTA by using the PGT is useful for patients with atypical chest pain who visited ER because it can reduce radiation dose to 54.8% while maintaining image quality and diagnostic accuracy in patients with HR less than 75 bpm, and evaluate the coronary arteries, aorta, pulmonary arteries, and entire intra-thoracic structures at the same time.",Excluded
2085,"Changes in performance and bio-mathematical model performance predictions during 45 days of sleep restriction in a simulated space mission Lunar habitation and exploration of space beyond low-Earth orbit will require small crews to live in isolation and confinement while maintaining a high level of performance with limited support from mission control. Astronauts only achieve approximately 6 h of sleep per night, but few studies have linked sleep deficiency in space to performance impairment. We studied crewmembers over 45 days during a simulated space mission that included 5 h of sleep opportunity on weekdays and 8 h of sleep on weekends to characterize changes in performance on the psychomotor vigilance task (PVT) and subjective fatigue ratings. We further evaluated how well bio-mathematical models designed to predict performance changes due to sleep loss compared to objective performance. We studied 20 individuals during five missions and found that objective performance, but not subjective fatigue, declined from the beginning to the end of the mission. We found that bio-mathematical models were able to predict average changes across the mission but were less sensitive at predicting individual-level performance. Our findings suggest that sleep should be prioritized in lunar crews to minimize the potential for performance errors. Bio-mathematical models may be useful for aiding crews in schedule design but not for individual-level fitness-for-duty decisions.",Excluded

At time of consultation, it had been 6 weeks since her last menstrual period. Four weeks after her last menstrual period, the results of a urine pregnancy test were negative. On that day, she received an ionizing radiation dose of 74 KBq (2 microCi) carbon 14 urea, followed by the breath test 30 minutes thereafter. Four days later, when the urine pregnancy test results turned positive, she was concerned about the possible effect of her exposure to ionizing radiation on the developing fetus.

The two conventional Western medical treatment was administered to all, including intravenous dripping of 2% lidocaine 20 mL, dexamethasone 5 mg, gentamycin 80,000 units, vitamin B(12) 5 mg, dissolved in saline 250 mL, and 5% sodium bicarbonate solution for gargling, but to the patients in the tested group, YHD was given additionally. The medication was started simultaneously all through the whole course of the radiotherapy. Patients were examined every day to observe and compare the degree, initiating time, and repairing time of their oral lesions; the dosage of radiation they received was recorded as well., RESULTS: The degree of mucomembranous reaction that appeared in most patients in the test group was of grade 1-2, while in the control group, it was grade 2-3. The average time for oral lesion of 1, 2, 3 grades to be initiated in the test group was 12.0+/-1.1, 11.0+/-1.3 and 10.0+/-0.8 days, respectively, after radiation started, which was later than that in the control group (P<0.01). Moreover, the average repairing time for the lesions of grades 1, 2, and 3 in the test group was 3.0+/-0.7, 10.0+/-1.3 and 19.0+/-0.8 days, which were shorter than those in the control group respectively (P<0.01). The radiation applied on the primary tumor of patients with oral lesion of grade 1-3 in the test group was 24.2+/-2.2, 42.0+/-2.6 and 58.0+/-1.6 Gy on the average, respectively, which were higher than that applied on patients in the control group (P<0.05 or P<0.01)., CONCLUSION: The Chinese herbal preparation YHD could alleviate oral mucomembranous reaction to radiation applied in patients with head-neck tumor.",Excluded
1356,"The perception of voice onset time: an fMRI investigation of phonetic category structure This study explored the neural systems underlying the perception of phonetic category structure by investigating the perception of a voice onset time (VOT) continuum in a phonetic categorization task. Stimuli consisted of five synthetic speech stimuli which ranged in VOT from 0 msec ([da]) to 40 msec ([ta]). Results from 12 subjects showed that the neural system is sensitive to VOT differences of 10 msec and that details of phonetic category structure are retained throughout the phonetic processing stream. Both the left inferior frontal gyrus (IFG) and cingulate showed graded activation as a function of category membership with increasing activation as stimuli approached the phonetic category boundary. These results are consistent with the view that the left IFG is involved in phonetic decision processes, with the extent of activation influenced by increased resources devoted to resolving phonetic category membership and/or selecting between competing phonetic categories. Activation patterns in the cingulate suggest that it is sensitive to stimulus difficulty and resolving response conflict. In contrast, activation in the posterior left middle temporal gyrus and the left angular gyrus showed modulation of activation only to the ""best fit"" of the phonetic category, suggesting that these areas are involved in mapping sound structure to its phonetic representation. The superior temporal gyrus (STG) bilaterally showed weaker sensitivity to the differences in phonetic category structure, providing further evidence that the STG is involved in the early analysis of the sensory properties of speech.",Excluded
877,"Gamma radiation tolerance in different life stages of the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster PURPOSE: Insects are known to have higher levels of radiation tolerance than mammals. The fruit fly Drosophila provides opportunities for genetic analysis of radiation tolerance in insects. A knowledge of stage-specific sensitivity is required to understand the mechanisms and test the existing hypothesis of insect radiation tolerance., MATERIALS AND METHODS: Drosophila melanogaster were irradiated using gamma rays at different life stages. Irradiation doses were chosen to start from 100-2200 Gy with increments of 100 Gy, with a dose rate of 12.5 and 25 Gy/min. The threshold of mortality, LD50 and LD100 1 h post-irradiation was recorded for larvae and adults and 24 h post-irradiation for eggs and after 2-3 days for early and late pupae. Total antioxidant capacity for all the life stages was measured using the phosphomolybdenum method., RESULTS: Twenty-four hours post-irradiation, 100% mortality was recorded for eggs at 1000 Gy. One hour post irradiation 100% mortality was recorded at 1300 Gy for first instar larvae, 1700 Gy for second instar larvae, 1900 Gy for feeding third instar larvae and 2200 Gy for non-feeding third instar larvae. Post-irradiation complete failure of emergence (100% mortality) was observed at 130 Gy for early pupae and 1500 Gy for late pupae; 100% mortality was observed at 1500 Gy for adults. The values of LD50 were recorded as 452 Gy for eggs, 1049 Gy for first instar larvae, 1350 Gy for second instar larvae, 1265 Gy for feeding third instar larvae, 1590 Gy for non-feeding third instar larvae, 50 Gy for early pupae, 969 Gy for late pupae, 1228 Gy for adult males and 1250 Gy for adult females., CONCLUSIONS: Early pupae were found to be prone to radiation, whereas the non-feeding third instar larvae were most resistant among all stages. The chromosome number being constant and total antioxidant capacity being nearly constant in all stages, we suggest that high rate of cell division during early pupae makes this stage sensitive to radiation.",Included

The guidewire insertion time, number of guidewire attempts, and radiation exposure during guidewire insertion were all significantly lower in the robot-assisted group than in the conventional group., CONCLUSIONS: Robot-assisted core decompression of the femoral head is as safe and effective as a conventional core decompression surgery. It can reduce operation time and decrease intraoperative radiation exposure.",Excluded
1644,"Non-invasive diffuse reflectance measurements of cutaneous melanin content can predict human sensitivity to ultraviolet radiation The diversity of human skin phenotypes and the ubiquitous exposure to ultraviolet radiation (UVR) underscore the need for a non-invasive tool to predict an individual's UVR sensitivity. We analysed correlations between UVR sensitivity, melanin content, diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (DR) and UVR-induced DNA damage in the skin of subjects from three racial/ethnic groups: Asian, Black or African American and White. UVR sensitivity was determined by evaluating each subject's response to one minimal erythemal dose (MED) of UVR one day after the exposure. Melanin content was measured using DR and by densitometric analysis of Fontana-Masson staining (FM) in skin biopsies taken from unexposed areas. An individual's UVR sensitivity based on MED was highly correlated with melanin content measured by DR and by FM. Therefore, a predictive model for the non-invasive determination of UVR sensitivity using DR was developed. The MED precision was further improved when we took race/ethnicity into consideration. The use of DR serves as a tool for predicting UVR sensitivity in humans that should be invaluable for determining appropriate UVR doses for therapeutic, diagnostic and/or cosmetic devices. © 2013 John Wiley & Sons A/S.",Excluded
1275,"Visualization of subsurface structures in cells and tissues by backscattered electron imaging A fraction of the beam electrons which interact with a specimen scatter back. The number of backscattered electrons (BE's) increases with the atomic number of the elements encountered. Cell and tissue structures lacking a heavy metal content yield few BE's compared to structures affixed with heavy metals, either vitally or by means of staining methods applied after fixation. The BE imaging mode of a scanning electron microscope (SEM) provides an intensity map of the BE yield from the specimen. BE imaging of selectively stained structures in cells and tissues renders these structures visible in contrast to the unstained surround. Since BE's can emerge from a significant depth within the material, BE imaging can be used to view such heavy metal stained structures beneath intact cell surfaces. The microcontours of the overlying surface can be viewed concurrently by using the surface scanning (i.e., the secondary electron imaging; SEI) mode of the microscope. Methods for selectively contrasting subsurface structures can be adapted from existing light microscope (LM) and transmission electron microscope (TEM) methods. Staining methods have been devised for subsurface viewing of cell organelles, including nuclei, mitochondria, peroxisomes, lysosomes, and phagosomes. A physical model is presented which describes these observations and suggests future possible trends in this subject. Specifically the image contrast and resolution are described in terms of the physical properties of the stain and specimen and of the SEM operating conditions of energy and current. Finally a summary of instrumentation considerations describes present and potential BE detectors, their ancillary electronics, and image processing.",Excluded
348,"Analysis of biologically equivalent dose of stereotactic body radiotherapy for primary and metastatic lung tumors Purpose: The purpose of this study was to determine the optimal biologically equivalent dose (BED) for stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) by comparing local control rates in proportion to various total doses and fractionation schedules. Material(s) and Method(s): Thirty-four patients with early non-small-cell lung cancer and a single metastatic lung tumor were included in this study. Differences in local control rates were evaluated according to gender, primary tumor site, response, tumor size, and BED. For comparison of BEDs, the prescribed dose for SBRT was stratified according to three groups: high (BED > 146 Gy), medium to high (BED, 106 to 146 Gy), and low to medium (BED < 106 Gy). Result(s): For all patients, the overall local control rate was 85.3% at two years after treatment. Five local recurrences were observed, and, notably, all of them were observed in the low to medium BED group. Significantly higher local control rates were observed for patients with a complete response than for those with a partial response or stable disease (p < 0.001). Twenty-six patients with a tumor size of < 3 cm showed no dose-response relationship in the low to medium, medium to high, and high BED groups, whereas eight patients with a tumor size of = 3 cm showed a significant dose-response relationship. The observed 2-year local recurrence-free survival rates in patients with a tumor size of < 3 cm and in those with a tumor size of = 3 cm were 96.2% and 50.0%, respectively, which were significantly different (p=0.007). Conclusion(s): BED > 100 Gy is required in order to achieve a > 85% local control rate regardless of tumor size. The optimal dose for small tumors of < 3 cm appears to be within a range below 150 Gy BED. Escalation of BED to high levels (> 150 Gy) may be required for patients with a tumor size larger than 3 cm.Copyright © 2014 by the Korean Cancer Association.",Excluded
1977,"Comparison of different cooling regimes within a shortened liquid cooling/warming garment on physiological and psychological comfort during exercise The aim of this study was to compare the effectiveness of different cooling regime intensities to maintain physiological and subjective comfort during physical exertion levels comparable to that engaged in during extravehicular activities (EVA) in space. We studied eight subjects (six males, two females) donned in our newly developed physiologically based shortened liquid cooling/warming garment (SLCWG). Rigorous (condition 1) and mild (condition 2) water temperature cooling regimes were compared at physical exertion levels comparable to that performed during EVA to ascertain the effectiveness of a lesser intensity of cooling in maintaining thermal comfort, thus reducing energy consumption in the portable life support system. Exercise intensity was varied across stages of the session. Finger temperature, rectal temperature, and subjective perception of overall body and hand comfort were assessed. Finger temperature was significantly higher in the rigorous cooling condition and showed a consistent increase across exercise stages, likely due to the restriction of heat extraction because of the intensive cold. In the mild cooling condition, finger temperature exhibited an overall decline with cooling, indicating greater heat extraction from the body. Rectal temperature was not significantly different between conditions, and showed a steady increase over exercise stages in both rigorous and mild cooling conditions. Ratings of overall comfort were 30% higher (more positive) and more stable in mild cooling (p<0.001). The mild cooling regime was more effective than rigorous cooling in allowing the process of heat exchange to occur, thus maintaining thermal homeostasis and subjective comfort during physical exertion.",Excluded
2448,"Extensive experience in the management of macroprolactinomas Objectives Macroprolactinomas are pituitary tumours that can be managed with dopamine agonists (DA), surgery and radiotherapy. We aimed to assess the outcomes of these treatment modalities. Design Retrospective case-note study of patients managed in a single tertiary referral centre. Patients One hundred patients (68 male) diagnosed with macroprolactinoma between 1971 and 2009. Measurements We assessed the response to first-line treatment in terms of reduction in serum prolactin, endocrine status, symptomatic improvement and tumour shrinkage. Patients were divided into a group that received only DA therapy and a group that received surgery, radiotherapy or both, with or without a DA. We compared pituitary function at baseline and at last clinic visit between the two groups. Results In total, there were 1170 patient years of follow-up. Pituitary surgery was performed in 29/100 patients. Fourteen patients received pituitary radiotherapy (8/14 surgery also). At last clinic visit, the nonmedical therapy group had a higher risk of gonadotrophin deficiency (77.4% vs 44.8%, P = 0.0037), TSH deficiency (54.8% vs 25.4%, P = 0.0009) and ACTH deficiency (56.2% vs 17.2%, P = 0.0001). When last reviewed, 23/29 (79.3%) patients who underwent surgery and 10/14 (71.4%) patients who received radiotherapy were taking a DA. Conclusions Treatment with a DA alone is associated with better outcomes in terms of pituitary function and as such represents the optimal first-line therapy for macroprolactinomas. Surgery and radiotherapy should be reserved for patients who are either intolerant of or resistant to DAs. Following surgery and/or radiotherapy, the majority of patients still require a DA for control of prolactin hypersecretion. © 2014 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",Excluded
3682,"Assessment of DNA damage in nuclear medicine personnel--comparative study with the alkaline comet assay and the chromosome aberration test Despite much research over the last few decades, there still remains considerable uncertainty as to the genetic impact of ionizing radiation on human populations, particularly at low levels. The aim of the present study was to provide data on the genetic hazards due to occupational exposure of low doses of ionizing radiation in nuclear medicine departments. The assessment of primary DNA damage in peripheral blood leukocytes of medical staff was performed using the alkaline comet assay and the data obtained were compared with the results of conventional cytogenetic biodosimetry using the chromosome aberration (CA) test. Altogether 120 subjects (60 exposed and 60 controls) participated in the study. Statistically significant increases in primary DNA damage and increased frequencies of CAs compared to controls were observed. Within the exposed population, significant inter-individual differences in DNA damage were found, indicating differences in genome sensitivity. Age and gender were not confounding factors, while smoking enhanced the levels of primary DNA damage only in control subjects, as revealed by both biomarkers studied. The present study suggests that genotoxic damage results from exposure to chronic low doses of ionizing radiation in nuclear medicine departments. Therefore, the exposed medical personnel should carefully comply with the radiation protection procedures and should minimize radiation exposure where possible to avoid potential genotoxic effects. The results obtained in this study point to the significance of biological indicators providing information on the actual risk to the radiation exposed individuals. According to our results, the alkaline comet assay and CA test are sensitive biomarkers that can be used as additional complements to physical dosimetry for assessing exposure to radiation in nuclear medicine personnel.",Included

MATERIAL AND METHODS: We conducted a retrospective study of 187 patients diagnosed with proximal humerus fractures. X-ray images of all patients were analysed, and on this basis, bone quality was assessed, using the Deltoid Tuberosity Index (DTI), average cortical bone thickness (CBTavg) and the Tingart measurement. The type of fracture was classified according to Neer's and Association for Osteosynthesis (AO) classifications. Moreover, the caput-collum-diaphyseal (CCD) angle was measured and the relationships between valgus or varus fractures and the DTI, CBTAVG and Tingart parameters were investigated in all patients. RESULT(S): Using the Neer classification, the most common fracture type was type 3, found in 90 patients (48.1%). A total of 51 patients (27.3%) sustained an AO B1 fracture. Significantly lower mean DTI values were noted in patients with a Neer 4 fracture compared to those with Neer 3 (p = 0.02) and Neer 2 fractures (p = 0.03). Moreover, significantly higher mean DTI (p <0.00) and CBTAVG (p <0.025) values were noted in the group of patients with valgus fractures (CCD> 140). CONCLUSION(S): 1.

However, the incidence of this ophthalmologic complication resulting from gamma knife radiosurgery (GKRS) has not yet been reported. The present study aimed to determine the risk of cataractogenesis associated with radiation exposure from GKRS., METHODS: This study used information from a random sample of one million persons enrolled in the nationally representative Taiwan National Health Insurance Research Database. The GK group consisted of patients who underwent GKRS between 2000 and 2009. The non-GK group was composed of subjects who had never undergone GKRS, but who were matched with the case group for time of enrollment, age, sex, history of coronary artery disease, hypertension, and diabetes., RESULTS: There were 277 patients in the GK group and 2770 matched subjects in the non-GK group. The GK group had a higher overall incidence of cataracts (10.11% vs. 7.26%; crude hazard ratio [cHR], 1.59; 95% CI, 1.07-2.36; adjusted hazard ratio [aHR], 1.25; 95% CI, 0.82-1.90) than the non-GK group. Patients who had undergone computed tomography and/or cerebral angiography (CT/angio) studies had a higher risk of developing cataracts than those who did not (10.82% vs. 6.64%; cHR, 1.74; 95% CI, 1.31-2.30; aHR, 1.65; 95% CI, 1.22-2.23).

We suggest routine dosimetry measurement of eye lens and proper protection for patients with benign lesions during GKRS. Regular follow-up imaging studies should avoid the use of CT/angio, and particular care should be taken in the 30-50-year-old age group, due to their significantly increased risk of cataract formation.",Included

MATERIALS AND METHODS: ""Extra"" images for routine chest CT were defined as those above lung apices (supraapical) and those caudal to the lowermost portion of lung parenchyma (infrapulmonary), including images obtained beyond the adrenal glands (infraadrenal). One hundred and forty-eight consecutive chest CT examinations (70 men, 78 women; age range, 15-90 years) performed September 13-25, 2003, were reviewed to determine the number of supraapical, infrapulmonary, and infraadrenal extra images. All examinations were performed using z-axis modulation (n = 70) or fixed tube current (n = 78). The CT dose index volume and dose-length product (DLP) values for the extra images were calculated. Two radiologists reviewed these extra images for pathologic findings. Student's t test was used to perform the statistical analysis. RESULT(S): One hundred forty-four (97%) examinations had supraapical extra images and 145 (98%) had infrapulmonary extra images. A total of 31 additional findings were observed in extra images. Most clinically important findings were identified in patients with a history of malignancy. With z-axis modulation, the mean DLP for supraapical and infrapulmonary extra images was 39.98 mGy x cm and 132.59 mGy x cm, respectively. With fixed tube current, the mean DLP for supraapical and infrapulmonary extra images was 30.31 mGy x cm and 95.91 mGy x cm, respectively. CONCLUSION(S): A substantial number of extra images are acquired during chest CT that do not add clinically important information in patients with nonmalignant indications.

Data on 188 patients were analysed; 90 patients received bowel preparation and 98 received no bowel preparation. There was no difference between the groups in terms of the number of films taken, the duration of the procedure, the visibility of the renal tracts or the overall quality of the studies. The prepared group did have significantly less faecal residue than the unprepared group. However, the renal tract visibility was no greater, as the combination of gas and haustral folds seen after bowel preparation obscured fine detail of the urinary tract as effectively as faecal residue. The hypothesis that adequate bowel preparation before IVU facilitates better quality studies must therefore be rejected.",Excluded
3012,"Radioiodine treatment of multinodular non-toxic goitre OBJECTIVE: To investigate the long term effect of radioactive iodine on thyroid function and size in patients with non-toxic multinodular goitre., DESIGN: Consecutive patients with multinodular non-toxic goitre selected for radioactive iodine treatment and followed for a minimum of 12 months (median 48 months) after an intended dose of 3.7 MBq/g thyroid tissue corrected to a 100% uptake of iodine-131 in 24 hours., PATIENTS: 69 patients with a growing multinodular non-toxic goitre causing local compression symptoms or cosmetic inconveniences. The treatment was chosen because of a high operative risk, previous thyroidectomy, or refusal to be operated on., MAIN OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS: Standard thyroid function variables and ultrasonically determined thyroid volume before treatment as well as 1, 2, 3, 6, and 12 months after treatment and then once a year., RESULTS: 56 patients were treated with a single dose of 131I, 12 with two doses, and one with four doses. In 45 patients treated with one dose and remaining euthyroid the median thyroid volume was reduced from 73 (interquartile range 50-106) ml to 29 (23-48) ml at 24 months in the 39 patients in whom this was measured during follow up. The median reduction was 40 (22-48) ml (60% reduction, p < 0.0001), half of which occurred within three months. Patients treated with two doses as well as those developing hypothyroidism and hyperthyroidism had a significant reduction in thyroid volume. Eleven patients developed hypothyroidism (cumulative five year risk 22%, 95% confidence interval 4.8% to 38.4%). Side effects were few: three cases of hyperthyroidism and two cases of radiation thyroiditis. Only one patient was dissatisfied with the result; she was referred for operation six months after treatment., CONCLUSIONS: A substantial reduction in thyroid volume accompanied by a low incidence of hypothyroidism and few side effects makes the use of radioactive iodine an attractive alternative to surgery in selected cases of non-toxic multinodular goitre.",Excluded
2943,"A tactile display for International Space Station (ISS) extravehicular activity (EVA) Background: A tactile display to increase an astronaut's situational awareness during an extravehicular activity (EVA) has been developed and ground tested. The Tactor Locator System (TLS) is a non-intrusive, intuitive display capable of conveying position and velocity information via a vibrotactile stimulus applied to the subject's neck and torso. In the Earth's 1 G environment, perception of position and velocity is determined by the body's individual sensory systems. Under normal sensory conditions, redundant information from these sensory systems provides humans with an accurate sense of their position and motion. However, altered environments, including exposure to weightlessness, can lead to conflicting visual and vestibular cues, resulting in decreased situational awareness. The TLS was designed to provide somatosensory cues to complement the visual system during EVA operations. Method(s): An EVA task was simulated on a computer graphics workstation with a display of the International Space Station (ISS) and a target astronaut at an unknown location. Subjects were required to move about the ISS and acquire the target astronaut using either an auditory cue at the outset, or the TLS. Subjects used a 6 degree of freedom input device to command translational and rotational motion. The TLS was configured to act as a position aid, providing target direction information to the subject through a localized stimulus. Result(s): Results show that the TLS decreases reaction time (p = 0.001) and movement time (p = 0.001) for simulated subject (astronaut) motion around the ISS. Conclusion(s): The TLS is a useful aid in increasing an astronaut's situational awareness, and warrants further testing to explore other uses, tasks and configurations.",Excluded
1335,"Investigation of the antibacterial effect of laser irradiation and chemical agent on human oral biofilms contaminated titanium discs Introduction: A main challenge in treatment of peri-implant disease is the effective decontamination of the implant surface. This challenge has always been a problem, associated with the treatment of these diseases with regard to the difficulty in removing and eliminating bacterial biofilm from the surface of dental implants, especially rough surfaces. The aim of this in-vivo study was to evaluate the effect of five different antimicrobial methods in reducing bacteria adhering to titanium surfaces. Material(s) and Method(s): In the present in-vivo study, the contaminated discs, except for the negative control group, randomly underwent one of five treatments: Erbium: Yattrium Aluminum Garnet (Er-YAG) laser, plastic curette, 0.12% chlorhexidine, aPDT, and 810 nm diode laser. A pectrophotometer was used to measure Optical Density (OD) in case of aerobic microorganisms. Colony-Forming Units (CFUs) were used for anaerobic bacteria. Then, all the analyses were carried out at a significance level of alpha = 0.05 through SPSS software. Finding(s): One-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) of aerobic bacteria showed a significant difference among 6 groups in terms of OD variations during a 0-24 h time interval (P < 0.001). The results of Kruskal-Wallis test were used to investigate the effect of study methods on anaerobic bacteria after 48 h, and the results showed a significant difference among 6 groups in terms of CFUs (P < 0.001). Conclusion(s): The results of the present study showed that all five mechanicals (plastic curette), chemical (CHX), laser (810 nm diode and Er: YAG), and aPDT methods could reduce oral biofilms from roughed surfaces of titanium discs. Er: YAG laser and plastic curette had the highest and the lowest effects respectively.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",Excluded

486,"Classification of benign and malignant breast lesions in ultrasound images using support vector machines One of the most common diseases prevalent among women is Breast cancer. In general, Mammography is applied for the detection of the breast cancer, whereas, the technique of Mammography makes use of the ionizing radiation. As a result, this technique does not detect the breast cancer in women having dense breast. In the beginning phases of malignancy, radiologist could experience the challenges in identifying the lesions. Hence, there is a need for one more screen test for the confirmation of the cancer. On the other hand, Sonography is also commonly used for the detection and classification of abnormalities of the breast owing to its cost-effectiveness, comfort level of patient, and non-ionizing radiation. Nevertheless, ultrasound images seem to be low contrast images as well as the physician could encounter the possible challenges in the identification of the lesions. Therefore, there has been an inevitable requirement in the development of Computer Aided Diagnosis (CAD) system for the purpose of classifying breast lesion in an accurate manner. This paper aims at the analyzing the Morphological and Fractal features in an effective manner for differentiating benign as well as malignant masses from ultrasound images.

2718,"Technological Advances in Arrhythmia Management Applied to Adults With Congenital Heart Disease Arrhythmias are a leading cause of morbidity in adults with congenital heart disease. Numerous challenges to managing arrhythmias include vascular access issues, intracardiac shunts, unconventional locations of the conduction system, and anatomical complexities. Technological advances are improving our ability to diagnose and treat arrhythmias. Implantable loop recorders and various technologies developed for consumers to record electrocardiographic tracings using smartphone applications, watches, and dedicated portable devices are expanding our armamentarium of diagnostic tools. Remote magnetic-guided catheter ablation is enhancing access to otherwise difficult to reach arrhythmia substrates. Cryoablation allows perinodal arrhythmias to be safely treated in patients with displaced or difficult to predict locations of the atrioventricular conduction system. Interventions that minimize radiation exposure to near 0 levels are gaining interest and pulmonary vein isolation procedures to treat atrial fibrillation are increasingly performed. Cardiac implantable electronic devices compatible with magnetic resonance imaging have become the norm. Subcutaneous defibrillators and leadless pacemakers are providing effective solutions to patients in whom transvenous leads are contraindicated or not desired. His-bundle pacing is emerging as a viable option to provide more physiological pacing. Progressive advances in multicomponent communicating leadless devices carry the promise of providing leadless dual chamber pacing and cardiac resynchronization therapy in the near future. The safety of transvenous lead extraction procedures is likely to improve with advances such as the low-pressure balloon to manage superior vena cava lacerations. Awareness of these developments and referral to sites with dedicated expertise could contribute to further improving outcomes in adults with congenital heart disease.

1575,"IL-6 promotes stemness of cancer stem cells and may contribute to radiation resistance of non-small cell lung cancer Background: Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer-related deaths among both men and women. Long-term survival of lung cancer patients remains low despite aggressive therapies including surgery, radiation, and chemotherapy. Ionizing radiation (IR) is the standard therapy for patients diagnosed with localized unresectable non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). However local tumor control by standard fractionated radiotherapy (RT) remains poor due to tumor resistance to IR. Accumulating evidences have indicated that cancer stem cells (CSCs, also known as cancer initiating cells) exist as a very minor population in NSCLC tumors, which are composed of heterogeneous cell populations. Our laboratory and others found that CSC population increases upon irradiation, which may contribute to radiation resistance. The role of IL-6 in NSCLC progression has been suggested since high IL-6 levels were detected in sera of lung cancer patients, but not detectable in most patients with benign lung diseases. However, the exact mechanism by which IL-6 influences lung cancer progression and its role in CSCs mediated radioresistance remain unresolved. Method(s): We isolated CD133+ CSC population from 3 NSCLC cell lines (NSCLC-CSCs) and studied the role of IL-6 in CD133+ CSCs growth by treating cells with IL-6. In addition, we manipulated IL-6 expression levels in the IL-6 expressing A549 and H157 cells by the knockdown of IL-6 using lentiviral infection system carrying IL-6siRNA and isolated CD133+ cells for further analyses. The growth and stem cell marker expressions of these CSCs, IL-6 treated or non-treated, or IL-6 expressing or knocked down cells upon irradiation were then investigated. The differences in the activation of signaling pathways and neuroendocrine differentiation were also studied. Results and Conclusion(s): We found that IL-6 increased self-renewal of NSCLC-CSCs significantly and thereby increased NSCLC-CSC population. We also found that IL-6 increased stemness of the isolated CD133+ CSCs when CD133+ cells were treated with IL-6. More importantly, when we irradiated the CD133+ CSCs isolated from the IL-6 knocked down and scramble control A549 cells, we found that the CSCs isolated from the IL-6 knocked down cells exhibited lower survival than the CSCs of control cells. Therefore, we suggest that IL-6 may contribute to NSCLC-CSCs mediated-radioresistance via (i) direct triggering radioresistance, and (ii) increasing self-renewal and stemness of the survived CSCs. Mechanistic dissection studies revealed that the increased self-renewal of CSCs by IL-6 is due to the activation of the hedgehog signaling and the increased expression of bcl-2, while the IL-6 mediated increase of radioresistance is due to the activation of neuroendocrine differentiation, Stat 3 signaling pathway, and increased expression of bcl-2.",Excluded
1937,"Gamma irradiation. An effective procedure for bone banks, but does it make sense from an osteobiological perspective? BACKGROUND: Bone grafts promote bone healing by supplying a three-dimensional structure that supports bone ingrowth. Autologous bone therefore still remains the ""gold standard"" for grafts. Unfortunately, autologous bone grafts are associated with an increased morbidity. In order to avoid such problems, intensive research has been carried out on alternative materials such as allogeneic bone. However, its use is dependent on bone banks and its availability is limited. Gamma irradiation is now becoming established as a procedure for inactivating bacteria, fungal spores and viruses. Its effects on the biomechanical properties of bone have been analyzed in numerous studies. However, the current literature provides little information as to the effects of gamma sterilization on the osteobiology of allogeneic bone grafts., PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effect of gamma-sterilized bone grafts on immunocompetent cells by an in vitro model (a culture of human bone marrow cells)., METHODS: We decided to use the model of human bone marrow cells in culture for the in vitro analysis because the physiological conditions in the human body can best be simulated in this model and the observed reactions are applicable to humans., RESULTS AND INTERPRETATION: In sum, we found a maximum immune response in gamma-irradiated bone grafts, which, interpreted as a sole result, must be seen as a negative biological effect. However, in view of the good clinical results for gamma-sterilized bone grafts other influences would seem to be the determining factors in clinical outcome. Further research is needed to gain a more exact understanding of these factors.",Included

Is it possible to decrease the mAs by 50 % with the NIP system without significant loss of information?, MATERIALS AND METHODS: From each of the 20 animals, three lateral radiographs were acquired. The assessment of the exposure level was based on the generated lgM-values. Images were acquired 1. with the NIP system and exposure settings equivalent to an lgM of 1.9, 2. with the PIP system and identical settings, and 3. with the NIP system and 50 % of the mAs. Six blinded readers used a 5-step scale to assess the reproducibility of five anatomical structures and image noise sensation. Data were analysed using Visual Grading Characteristics Analysis (VGC)., RESULTS: While applying identical exposure values the NIP system for all features revealed superior ratings to those of the PIP system (AUC (VGC) values ranged from 0.81 for ""cardiac silhouette"" to 0.92 for ""trachea""). Even when reducing mAs by 50 % in the NIP images all features were rated better compared with the PIP images and original settings (AUC (VGC) values ranged from 0.60 for ""cardiac silhouette"" to 0.74 for ""trachea"" and ""caudal thoracic field"")., CONCLUSION: The NIP system demonstrates clearly better image quality compared to the reference PIP system. A dose reduction of 50 % seems to be possible without relevant detraction from image quality. The results obtained in the animal model are valid for simulating conditions in neonatal radiological practise.",Excluded
3550,"Multilocus inheritance determines predisposition to alpha-radiation induced bone tumourigenesis in mice In a recent study, we presented evidence for genetic predisposition governing radiation osteosarcomagenesis in mice. Following the incorporation of the bone-seeking alpha emitter 227Th, ~25% of the variance in osteosarcoma incidence was determined by inherited genetic factors. We have now mapped 5 susceptibility loci in crosses between the more susceptible BALB/c and the more resistant CBA/Ca strains. The major QTL on chromosome 14 overlaps with a locus that was already found in our previous study, using different strains of mice. Here, we investigate the effect by which the major susceptibility locus and 4 minor modifier loci interact to influence osteosarcoma predisposition. Following incorporation of the bone-seeking isotope, 100% of mice that harbour high-risk genotypes at all 5 susceptibility loci develop osteosarcoma with an average of 472 days latency times. In 10 mice inheriting exclusively low-risk genotypes only 1 osteosarcoma was found, arising after 733 days latency time. Inheritance of distinct combinations of BALB/c and CBA/Ca alleles at the susceptibility loci confer more extreme phenotypes in terms of susceptibility or resistance than observed in either of the two parental inbred strains. From the present study, we demonstrate that additive effects of multiple alleles, each making only a minor phenotypic contribution, can combine and significantly alter tumour risk. This mechanism can be of particular importance in genetically heterogeneous populations such as man. © 2005 Wiley-Liss, Inc.",Included
1947,"Local control and fracture risk following stereotactic body radiation therapy for non-spine bone metastases Aims: To report local control and toxicity rates for patients treated with stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) for non-spine bone metastases. Methods and materials: Eighty-one patients with 106 non-spine bone metastases were treated between 2011 and 2014 and retrospectively reviewed. Indications included: oligometastases (63%), oligoprogression (17.3%), retreatment (2.4%) or other (17.3%). Cumulative incidence function was used to assess local recurrence and fracture probability. Bivariate relationships were investigated based on selected patient, tumour and dose-volume factors. Result(s): Mean follow-up was 13 months (range, 0.25-45.6) and the median patient age was 66.4 years (range, 36-86). Most patients were male (60.5%) and the predominant histology prostate cancer (32%). Bone metastases were most commonly located in the pelvis (41.5%) and almost half sclerotic. The most common prescriptions were 30 Gy/5 (30.2%) and 35 Gy/5 (42.5%). The cumulative incidence of local recurrence at 6,18 and 24 months respectively was 4.7%, 8.3% and 13.3% with a mean time to local recurrence of 11.8 months (range, 3.9-23.4). A significant association was found between local recurrence and volume of the PTV (p = 0.02), with larger PTVs having a greater risk of local failure. Fracture was observed radiographically in the treatment volume in 9/106 (8.5%) of treated lesions and the mean time to fracture was 8.4 months (range, 0.7-32.5 months). With respect to predictors, a trend was observed for lytic lesions (p = 0.11) and female gender (p = 0.09). Conclusion(s): The results of this study confirm that SBRT yields high rates of long-term local control for non-spine bone metastases with a low fracture risk.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier B.V.",Excluded
2508,"Integrating Salvage Hypofractionated Radiosurgery with Low-Dose Adjuvant VEGF for Locally Recurrent Brain Metastasis with High-Dose Irradiation Previously Purpose/Objective(s): Selection of the appropriate treatment for recurrent brain metastasis remains uncertain. Recent studies have demonstrated a significant response rate and acceptable toxicity with the use of fractionated stereotactic radiosurgery (FSRS) in locally recurrent glioblastoma and large brain metastasis patients due to high ""therapeutic ratio"" (ratio of tumor cell killing to normal tissue toxicity).However, radiation necrosis (RN) is a severe complication associated with salvage re-irradiation. RN may be treated with bevacizumab, which blocks the effects of vascular endothelial growth factor in leakage-prone capillaries. The purpose of this research was to evaluate the efficacy and toxicity of FSRS combined with the early use of low-dose bevacizumab as a new salvage treatment scheme for locally recurrent brain metastases with high dose irradiation. Materials/Methods: Patients with locally recurrent intracranial metastasis previously treated with SRS or WBRT with SRS were enrolled in this prospective study. The salvage FSRS dose ranged from 9.5to 29 Gy in two to five sessions with 62-75% isodoseline by robotic radiosurgery according to the brain tumor volume, site, and previous irradiation dose. Bevacizumab was prescribed to all patients within 24 hours after completion of the treatment for four cycles (5 mg/kg, 3-week intervals).Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), Karnofsky Performance Scale (KPS), adverse events, and associated clinical outcomes were recorded. The primary objective of this study was to identify the overall survival after salvage treatment. Secondary objectives included clinical response (KPS), imaging response (MRI), and treatment-related adverse events. Result(s): From December 2009 to October 2016, a total of 24 patients were enrolled. Of these patients, 9 received WBRT followed by SRS, and 15 underwent SRS. The median 1-year overall survival (OS) after salvage SRS was 87.5%. Twenty-three (96%) patients had a positive imaging response within a range of 6 to 22 cm3 (median 14 cm3, p= 0.032, paired t-test). Significant clinical improvement was achieved (p<0.05, best KPS, paired t-test). Grade 1/2 fatigue was observed in 8 (33%) patients. Other grade 1 or 2 toxicities included headache, hypertension, and nausea. Grade 3 fatigue and headache occurred in 1 patient. No grade 4 toxicity was observed. Conclusion(s): Salvage FSRS with early use of low dose adjuvant bevacizumab treatment showed favorable clinical and radiologic control with manageable toxicity for locally recurrent brain metastasis patients who underwent high dose irradiation previously. The diagnosis of RN and LR after salvage FSRS merit further study.Copyright © 2019",Excluded

A preoperative diagnosis of stage IIIB cancer was based on mediastinoscopy or a thoracotomy in all patients. Induction treatment included two cycles of cisplatin (100 mg/m2, day 1), 5-fluorouracil (1 g/m2, days 1-3), and vinblastine (4 mg/m2, day 1) combined with 42 Gy of hyperfractionated radiotherapy delivering 21 Gy in two sessions. Patients with a clinical response were offered surgery. Result(s): The minimum follow-up for survivors was 48 months. Thirty patients had a T4 lesion and 18 had N3 disease. Twenty-nine patients (73%) had a clinical objective tumor response after induction treatment. These 29 patients underwent thoracotomy, and a complete resection was performed in 23 (58%). Two postoperative deaths occurred (7%). Four patients had a pathologic complete response at the time of surgery (10%). The 5-year survival is 19% for the overall population. When only patients who had persistent viable tumor cells at surgery are considered (n = 25), the 5-year survival is 28%. The 5-year survival is 42% for patients having no mediastinal lymph node involvement at the time of surgery and being treated with complete resection. Conclusion(s): This study shows that surgery, when feasible, is associated with a 28% long-term survival for patients in whom chemoradiotherapy alone fails to control disease.",Excluded

Methods and Materials: We reviewed the records of 209 consecutive patients with desmoid fibromatosis treated with RT, either alone or as combined-modality therapy (CMT) with surgery, at our institution from 1965 to 2015. Result(s): Median follow-up time was 98 months (range, 1-509 months). The 5- and 10-year local control (LC) was 71% and 69%, respectively. Fifty-nine patients (28%) experienced a local recurrence at a median time of 23 months (interquartile range, 15-38 months). Among all patients, on multivariable analysis, adjusting for anatomic site, size, age, treatment era (>2005 vs <=2005), treatment approach (RT alone vs CMT), and an interaction between age and treatment, we found only age <=30 years (hazard ratio [HR], 2.94; P =.005; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.38-6.27) and large tumor size >10 cm (HR, 2.51; P =.03; 95% CI, 1.09-5.78) to be correlated with poorer LC. Notably, for patients receiving RT alone, the 5-year LC was 43% for patients <=30 years old versus 75% for >30 years old (P <.001). On multivariable analyses, for patients receiving RT alone, the only factor associated with inferior LC was age <=30 years (HR, 2.87; P =.001; 95% CI, 1.51-5.47). The same was true for patients treated with CMT; age <=30 years was the only factor associated with inferior LC (HR, 5.36; P =.01; 95% CI, 1.40-20.58). Conclusion(s): Among all patients with desmoid fibromatosis, RT is an effective local therapy for tumor control. However, young patients <= 30 years have notably high rates of local recurrence regardless of treatment strategy, which requires further study. Treatment decisions should be risk-adapted by large referral centers with multidisciplinary expertise in desmoid management.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.",Excluded

Uranium concentrations in drinking water varied from < 1 to 845 ppb. This nonin-vasive study relied on the measurement of a combination of urinary indicators of kidney function and markers for cell toxicity. In all, 54 individuals (12-73 years old) participated in the study. Correlation of uranium excreted in urine with bio-indicators at p <=.05 indicated interference with the kidney's reabsorptive function. Because of the community's concerns regarding cancer incidence, the authors also calculated cumulative radiation doses using uranium intake in drinking water over the preceding 15-year period. The highest total uranium intake over this period was 1,761 mg. The risk of cancer from the highest dose, 2.1 mSv, is 13 in 100,000, which would be difficult to detect in the community studied (population size = 1,480). This study indicates that at the observed levels of uranium intake, chemical toxicity would be a greater health concern than would radiation dose. © 2009 Heldref Publications.",Included

561,"Treatment outcomes of radiotherapy for tonsillar carcinoma in the era of intensity-modulated radiotherapy Background: We performed this study to analyze treatment outcomes and to evaluate prognostic factors in patients with tonsillar carcinoma who were treated with radiotherapy (RT). Material(s) and Method(s): We retrospectively reviewed 164 patients with tonsillar carcinoma treated with RT between January 1979 and September 2009. Of the 164 patients, 91 were treated with 2-dimensional RT (2D-RT), 46 were treated with 3-dimensional conformal RT (3D-CRT), and 27 were treated with intensity-modulated RT (IMRT). When patients were treated with IMRT, simultaneous integrated boost was used. Thirty patients were treated with RT alone, 40 patients were treated with chemotherapy and RT (CRT), 66 patients were treated with surgery and RT and/or chemotherapy (SRT), and 28 patients were treated with concurrent chemoradiotherapy (CCRT). Bilateral neck irradiation was delivered to 141 patients, and ipsilateral neck irradiation to 23 patients. In definitive RT, median dose was 70 Gy (range, 51-71), 70 Gy (54-74), and 67.5 Gy for 2D-RT, 3D-CRT, and IMRT, respectively. In postoperative RT, median dose was 64.8 Gy (range, 54-70.2), 66 Gy (54-70), and 63 Gy (60-67.5) for 2D-RT, 3D-CRT, and IMRT, respectively. Acute and late toxicity were graded according to the Radiation Therapy Oncology Group radiation morbidity scoring criteria. Result(s): The median follow-up time was 42 months (range, 2-288). The 5-year locoregional progression-free survival (LRPFS), distant metastasisfree survival (DMFS), disease-free survival (DFS), and overall survival (OS) rates were 86%, 94%, 82%, and 80%, respectively. In the univariate analysis, 5-year DFS rate was associated with the RT technique (2DRT, 77%; 3D-CRT, 82%; IMRT, 100%, p = 0.035), T stage (T1-2, 87%; T3-4, 74%, p = 0.036), and treatment modality (RT alone, 55%; CRT, 78%; SRT, 92%; CCRT, 92%, p < 0.0001).

None of the patients who were treated with ipsilateral neck irradiation experienced relapse in contralateral neck nodes. After the completion of RT, patients who were treated with 2D-RT, 3D-CRT, IMRT, ipsilateral neck irradiation, and bilateral neck irradiation experienced grade >=2 xerostomia 91%, 58%, 59%, 35%, and 78%, respectively. At least 6 months of follow-up, patients who were treated with 2D-RT, 3D-CRT, IMRT, ipsilateral neck irradiation, and bilateral neck irradiation experienced grade <=1 xerostomia 52%, 76%, 78%, 98%, and 63%, respectively. Conclusion(s): In selected patients with well lateralized tonsillar carcinoma, ipsilateral neck irradiation can be an alternative to bilateral neck irradiation, regarding DFS rate and complications. There was no failure when patients were treated with IMRT, but long-term follow-up is needed to evaluate the 72.0 Gy in 42 fractions/6 weeks). The primary endpoint was the treatment completion rate of patients who completed >= 70% of the cetuximab planned dose administration (in terms of the relative dose intensity of cetuximab) and the full dose of radiotherapy >= 2 weeks over the planned schedule (in terms of radiotherapy duration >=8 weeks). Result(s): From Mar 2009 until Jan 2010, 27 pts were screened. Of them, 22 pts were enrolled and treated (ITT population). Patients characteristics of ITT population: median age (years), 67.0 (range, 53 to 81); male/female, 21/1 pts; oropharynx/hypopharynx/larynx, 6/8/8 pts; stage III/IV, 12/10 pts. The median duration of cetuximab treatment was 7.9 weeks (range, 7 to 9), and that of RT was 44.0 days (range, 40 to 52). All 22 pts completed the treatment, and the completion rate was 100% (95% CI: 84.6%, 100.0%). The response rate (CR+PR) post RT was 81.8% (assessed by the independent committee). All pts experienced AEs. Most common AEs with grade 3/4 were mucosal inflammation (16pts, 72.7%), dermatitis (6pts, 27.3%), infection, radiation skin injury and stomatitis (each in 5 pts, 22.7%). Conclusion(s): The completion rate (100%) and the response rate (81.8%) are comparable to those of the cetuximab + RT group in the multinational randomized phase III study (Bonner et al. 2006). AEs were consistent with the underlying disease, administration of RT or cetuximab. The study results demonstrate that cetuximab + RT is well-tolerated, a feasible and efficacious treatment in Japanese pts. superiority of IMRT. Our results were not able to confirm which treatment regimen is most optimal. So, further study is needed to confirm the optimal therapeutic regimen.",Excluded

910,"Evaluating the radioprotective effect of Cimetidine, IMOD, and hybrid radioprotectors agents: An in-vitro study INTRODUCTION: There are various radioprotective agents with different mechanisms that help to decrease ionizing radiation side effects. The radioprotective effect of Cimetidine and IMOD was assessed individually and compared with the hybrid radioprotectors agents (HRPAs-IMOD and Cimetidine) on human lymphocyte cells., METHODS: Twenty healthy volunteers (ten men and ten women) participated in the present study. About 75 mL peripheral blood lymphocytes from each individual were collected, and they were divided into 36 groups. Briefly, the blood samples were treated with different concentrations of Cimetidine (12.6 and 25.2 mug/mL) and IMOD (0.04, 0.08, and 0.12 mg/mL), and also a combination of these agents, namely hybrid radioprotectors agents (HRPAs). Besides, the irradiated groups were exposed to 2 and 4 Gy of Co-60 gamma irradiation. The amount of cellular damage was assessed using the micronucleus assay. The repeated measurements and paired T-test statistical analysis were used to compare the micronucleus frequencies in different groups., RESULTS: The micronucleus frequencies were significantly reduced (p < 0.05) in irradiated groups when the non-toxic concentrations of Cimetidine, IMOD, and HRPAs have been used. The reduction in micronucleus frequency was obtained 5-29% for Cimetidine and 40-51% for IMOD in peripheral blood lymphocytes irradiated with 2 Gy. This reduction in 4 Gy irradiation was 8-17% for Cimetidine and 27-37% for IMOD. The HRPAs resulted in a higher radioprotective effect, in a way that they cause up to 58% and 43% micronucleus frequency reduction in 2 and 4 Gy, respectively., CONCLUSION: In conclusion, the HRPAs showed the highest level of radioprotective. In addition, IMOD was remarkably higher radioprotective than Cimetidine, which may be related to its greater non-toxic concentrations. Copyright © 2021 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",Included

The so called universal systems with a magnified panel are becoming more common. In this study we tried to find out whether in practice the increased surface area of detectors may increase the absorption dose in a patient., MATERIAL AND METHODS: The study included 486 patients who underwent coronary angiography carried out by the same physicians. In 268 subjects the procedure was performed in cathlab A equipped with a cardiac angiography system, whereas in 218 subjects in cathlab B using universal angiography system. In the study the absorbed dose of irradiation by the patient was determined and its ratio to body mass, body mass index (BMI) and body surface area (BSA) was evaluated., RESULTS: The mean dose absorbed by the person under study did not differ between both catheterization laboratories. Similarly, there were no differences in the ratio of the absorbed dose and BMI. But the comparison of the ratio of the absorbed dose and the body mass showed significantly higher values in cathlab A, where. higher values of the ratio of the absorbed dose and BSA were also found (p < 0.01)., CONCLUSIONS: In the present study it was found that the use of universal angiography systems with a larger surface area of the detecting panel is not connected with the increase in the irradiation dose absorbed by the patent during coronary angiography as compared with classical cardiac angiography systems.",Excluded
75,"Targeted alpha particle immunotherapy for myeloid leukemia Unlike beta particle-emitting isotopes, a emitters can selectively kill individual cancer cells with a single atomic decay. HuM195, a humanized anti-CD33 monoclonal antibody, specifically targets myeloid leukemia cells and has activity against minimal disease. When labeled with the beta-emitters 131I and 90Y, HuM195 can eliminate large leukemic burdens in patients, but it produces prolonged myelosuppression requiring hematopoietic stem cell transplantation at high doses. To enhance the potency of native HuM195 yet avoid the nonspecific cytotoxicity of beta-emitting constructs, the alpha-emitting isotope 213Bi was conjugated to HuM195. Eighteen patients with relapsed and refractory acute myelogenous leukemia or chronic myelomonocytic leukemia were treated with 10.36 to 37.0 MBq/kg 213Bi-HuM195. No significant extramedullary toxicity was seen. All 17 evaluable patients developed myelosuppression, with a median time to recovery of 22 days. Nearly all the 213Bi-HuM195 rapidly localized to and was retained in areas of leukemic involvement, including the bone marrow, liver, and spleen. Absorbed dose ratios between these sites and the whole body were 1000-fold greater than those seen with beta-emitting constructs in this antigen system and patient population. Fourteen (93%) of 15 evaluable patients had reductions in circulating blasts, and 14 (78%) of 18 patients had reductions in the percentage of bone marrow blasts. This study demonstrates the safety, feasibility, and antileukemic effects of 213Bi-HuM195, and it is the first proof-of-concept for systemic targeted a particle immunotherapy in humans. © 2002 by The American Society of Hematology.",Excluded
540,"Comparison of three fractionation schedules in radiotherapy for early glottic squamous cell carcinoma Background/Aim: Radiotherapy is widely accepted as the treatment of choice for early glottic squamous cell carcinoma (EGSCC), although it varies greatly with respect to dose, dose per fraction, and treatment techniques. The study aim was to evaluate the use of accelerated fractionation strategy (AFS) for EGSCC in standard clinical practice. Patients and Methods: Patients treated with definitive radiotherapy for EGSCC between 2008 and 2019 were retrospectively identified and received either conventional fractionation, hypofractionation, or hyperfractionation. Result(s): One hundred six patients were analyzed, and 19, 71, and 16 patients underwent conventional fractionation, hypofractionation, and hyperfractionation, respectively. The median follow-up was 56 months. The 5-year local control and overall survival rates were 79% and 83%; 78% and 79%; and 87% and 77%, respectively, and no significant difference was observed between the fractionation schedules. Conclusion(s): Our findings confirmed the utility of AFS in standard clinical practice and support its use for patients with EGSCC.Copyright © 2020 International Institute of Anticancer Research.

1858,"Cohort study of occupational cosmic radiation dose and cancer mortality in German aircrew, 1960-2014 Objectives To determine cancer mortality compared with the general population and to examine dose-response relationships between cumulative occupational radiation dose and specific cancer outcomes in the German aircrew cohort. Methods For a cohort of 26 846 aircrew personnel, standardised mortality ratios (SMR) were calculated. Dose-response analyses were carried out using Poisson regression to assess dose-related cancer risks for the period 1960-2014. Exposure assessment comprises recently available dose register data for all cohort members and newly estimated retrospective cabin crew doses for 1960-2003. Results SMR for all-cause, specific cancer groups and most individual cancers were reduced in all aircrew groups. The only increases were seen for brain cancer in pilots (n=23, SMR 2.01, 95% CI 1.15 to 3.28) and for malignant melanoma (n=10, SMR 1.88, 95% CI 0.78 to 3.85). Breast cancer mortality among female cabin crew was similar to the general population (n=71, SMR 1.06, 95% CI 0.77 to 1.44). Overall median cumulative effective dose was 34.2 mSv (max: 116 mSv) for 1960-2014. No dose-response associations were seen in any of the models. For brain cancer, relative risks were elevated across dose categories. An indicative negative trend with increasing dose category was seen for large intestine cancer in female cabin crew (n=23). Conclusions There was no evidence for significant dose-response patterns for the considered cancer types. Interpretation of results remains difficult as cumulative dose is closely related to age. Future work should focus on investigating radiation jointly with other risk factors that may contribute to risks for specific cancers among aircrew.Copyright © Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2020.

972,"MR enterography in the investigation of unexplained abdominal pain Introduction: Magnetic Resonance Enterography (MRE) has an established role in the management of patients with small bowel (SB) Crohn's disease (CD)1 and has the advantages of diagnosing extra-enteric lesions which may be clinically significant2 and being free from the risks of radiation exposure. There is little published data on the use of MRE in the investigation of patients with unexplained chronic abdominal pain. Method(s): A retrospective review of casenotes was conducted of patients who underwent MRE at Southend University Hospital to investigate unexplained abdominal pain and suspected SB disease between January 2008 and October 2010. The patients did not have a pre-existing diagnosis of CD made by colonoscopy or capsule endoscopy (CE). Demographic data, symptoms, previous investigations and final diagnosis were recorded. MRE was performed using a 1.5 Tesla MR scanner following a minimum 6-hour fast and preparation with Klean prep an hour prior to the scan. Two T2-weighted sequences single-shot fast spin-echo and fast imaging employing steady state acquisition were performed in the axial and coronal planes. Result(s): 181 patients (60 male, 121 female) underwent MRE: 43 also had diarrhoea, 14 weight loss and 13 vomiting. The median age was 39 years (range 13 - 85). MRE found clinically significant abnormalities in 33 patients (18.2%): 18/33 had a prior abdominal CT scan, MRE was used to clarify CT findings in 9/33. Findings are as follows: - 12 SB CD (3 CT suggestive) - 3 SB carcinoid tumour (1 CT suggestive, 1 CE suggestive) - 4 adhesional SB obstruction (2 CT abnormal) - 1 SB stricture - 1 gastric GIST - confirmed at resection (normal CT and gastroscopy) - 1 jejunal tumour - adenocarcinoma at resection (normal CT) - 1 duodenal mass with intussusception - villous adenoma at resection (OGD and CT suggestive) - 1 ovarian endometrioma and 1 renal cell carcinoma - confirmed at biopsy or resection - 1 peritoneal metastases - metastatic breast carcinoma at biopsy (CT: colonic thickening and free fluid) - 1 intussusception - 1 splenic mass (CT: splenic mass, granulomatous disease on resection) - 1 retroperitoneal nodes and splenomegaly (CT similar findings, further investigation hypogammaglobulinaemia) - 1 persistent vitello-intestinal cyst (CT normal, confirmed on resection) - 1 gallstones and cholecystitis - 1 PUJ obstruction (CT similar findings) - 1 colonic diverticular disease Conclusion(s): MRE is a useful investigation for unexplained chronic abdominal pain in patients not known to have CD.

At 1 DAI, the solar UV-exposed skin did not show marked changes, while artificial UV irradiated skin exhibited a visible erythematous reaction and prominent histological alterations such as epidermal thickening, appearance of sunburn cells and deformation elastic fibers. At 4 DAI of solar UV-exposure, the skin color became moderately dark and noticeable pigmentation developed in the epidermis. In contrast, at 4 DAI of artificial UV irradiation, there still remained moderate degeneration in the epidermis and dermis, and delayed tanning was weak. At 7 DAI of solar exposure, delayed suntan reactions became more prominent. Histologically, there were heavy pigmentation of melanin granules mainly in the stratum basale. On the other hand, artificial UV irradiated skin showed less pigmentation. Thus, solar exposure provoked remarkable pigmentation while artificial UV irradiation brought about severe sunburn reactions in the dorsal skin of hairless dogs.",Excluded

Results of a Phase 2 Study PURPOSE: This prospective phase II study assessed safety and feasibility of surgery followed by hypofractionated radiosurgery (HSRS) on the tumor bed in oligometastatic patients with single large brain metastases (BMs)., METHODS AND MATERIALS: Between June 2015 and May 2018, 101 patients were enrolled. Oligometastatic disease was defined by a maximum of 5 extracranial metastatic lesions. HSRS was performed within 1 month of surgery and consisted of 30 Gy in 3 fractions. Local control, occurrence of new BMs, overall survival, and treatment-related toxicities were assessed., RESULTS: At a median follow-up time of 26 months, local recurrence occurred in 6 patients (5.9%). Six-month, 1-year, and 2-year local control rates were 100%, 98.9% +/- 1.1%, and 85.9% +/- 0.6%, respectively. New BMs occurred in 39 patients (38.6%); median brain distant progression time and 6-month, 1-year, and 2-year brain distant progression rates were 39 months (95% CI, 19-39 months), 17% +/- 3.7%, 31.4% +/- 4.8%, and 42.5% +/- 5.9%, respectively. At the last observation time, 50 patients (49.5%) were alive and 51 (50.5%) were dead; 10 patients died owing to neurologic causes and 40 as a result of systemic progression. Median overall survival time and 6-month, 1-year, and 2-year overall survival rates were 22 months (95% CI, 20-30 months), 95% +/- 2.1%, 81.9% +/- 3.8%, and 46.6% +/- 6%, respectively. Infratentorial site, residual tumor volume, longer interval time between primary diagnosis and occurrence of BMs, and oligometastatic disease status significantly influenced outcome. Grade 2 to 3 radionecrosis occurred in 26 patients. Neurocognitive functions remained stable or, in some cases, improved., CONCLUSIONS: Surgery followed by HSRS on the tumor bed is a safe and effective approach, affording good brain control with acceptable toxicities. As for extracranial metastatic sites, patients with BMs can benefit from local ablative treatment in the context of an oligometastatic disease. Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

184,"Irradiation as a quarantine treatment for the solenopsis mealybug, Phenacoccus solenopsis Phenacoccus solenopsis is an aggressively invasive species that targets agricultural and ornamental plants, thereby threatening the world cotton industry and other crops. P. solenopsis has been listed as a quarantine insect in Europe and China. The utilization of phytosanitary irradiation as a potential treatment for disinfesting agricultural commodities in trade has expanded rapidly in recent years. A reasonable dose of radiation to eliminate P. solenopsis needs to be determined, taking into account the side effects of radiation on agricultural products and the species-specific tolerance of the insect to radiation. We applied radiation ranging from 50 to 200. Gy to P. solenopsis to determine the optimal dose. Both the radiation dose and the developmental stage of the insect were independent variables. Higher doses of radiation or lesser mature insect stages provided more effective treatment. In nymphs, a radiation dose of 100. Gy caused extinction of the irradiated population by disrupting ovary development, while 150. Gy caused 100% mortality. In adults, all tested doses of irradiation did not affect longevity, but we were able to prevent reproduction with high (150 and 200. Gy) doses. In P. solenopsis, a 100. Gy dose of radiation could eliminate the irradiated population in two generations. The mortality curve showed a steep slope beyond 150. Gy; thus, if killing all of the insects in a shorter amount of time is necessary, 200.

456,"Effective surgical adjuvant therapy for high-risk rectal carcinoma BACKGROUND: Radiation therapy as an adjunct to surgery for rectal cancer has been shown to reduce local recurrence but has not improved survival. In a previous study, combined radiation and chemotherapy improved survival significantly as compared with surgery alone, but not as compared with adjuvant radiation, which many regard as standard therapy. We designed a combination regimen to optimize the contribution of chemotherapy, decrease recurrence, and improve survival as compared with adjuvant radiation alone., METHODS: Two hundred four patients with rectal carcinoma that was either deeply invasive or metastatic to regional lymph nodes were randomly assigned to postoperative radiation alone (4500 to 5040 cGy) or to radiation plus fluorouracil, which was both preceded and followed by a cycle of systemic therapy with fluorouracil plus semustine (methyl-CCNU)., RESULTS: After a median follow-up of more than seven years, the combined therapy had reduced the recurrence of rectal cancer by 34 percent (P = 0.0016; 95 percent confidence interval, 12 to 50 percent). Initial local recurrence was reduced by 46 percent (P = 0.036; 95 percent confidence interval, 2 to 70 percent), and distant metastasis by 37 percent (P = 0.011; 95 percent confidence interval, 9 to 57 percent). In addition, combined therapy reduced the rate of cancer-related deaths by 36 percent (P = 0.0071; 95 percent confidence interval, 14 to 53 percent) and the overall death rate by 29 percent (P = 0.025; 95 percent confidence interval, 7 to 45 percent). Its acute toxic effects included nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, leukopenia, and thrombocytopenia. These effects were seldom severe. Severe, delayed treatment-related reactions, usually small-bowel obstruction requiring surgery, occurred in 6.7 percent of all patients receiving radiation, and the frequencies of these complications were comparable in both treatment groups., CONCLUSIONS: The combination of postoperative local therapy with radiation plus fluorouracil and systemic therapy with a fluorouracil-based regimen significantly and substantively improves the results of therapy for rectal carcinoma with a poor prognosis, as compared with postoperative radiation alone.",Excluded

Method(s): CERENAT is a multicenter case-control study carried out in four areas in France in 2004-2006. Data about mobile phone use were collected through a detailed questionnaire delivered in a face-to-face manner. Conditional logistic regression for matched sets was used to estimate adjusted ORs and 95% CIs. Result(s): A total of 253 gliomas, 194 meningiomas and 892 matched controls selected from the local electoral rolls were analysed. No association with brain tumours was observed when comparing regular mobile phone users with non-users (OR=1.24; 95% CI 0.86 to 1.77 for gliomas, OR=0.90; 95% CI 0.61 to 1.34 for meningiomas).

In the USA, ECP is performed with closed-loop devices only, whereas in other countries both closed-loop and two-step open-loop systems are used. Aim(s): In the current study, collection and apoptosis cell generation using two ECP approaches were prospectively compared. Method(s): The open-loop procedure (modality A) was performed for 2 consecutive days followed by the closed-loop procedure (modality B) that was carried out for 2 consecutive days 2 weeks later. Findings on the levels of hematocrit (Hct), WBC, monocytes (mono), lymphocytes (lympho), neutrophils (neutro), product bag volume and collection duration were analyzed. Early and late apoptosis of product cells was also assessed. Specimens were collected from the product bag before adding 8-MOP and after UVA irradiation. Mononuclear cells (MNC) were separated using Lymphoprep (Axis-Shield), measured and suspended in cell culture flasks at a concentration of 4 x 106/ml in the RPMI-1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. The cells were incubated for 48 h at 37degreeC. MNC subsets (lymphocyte, monocyte) were identified by: CD3,CD4,CD8a,CD14,CD25,CD11C,CD123,CD56,DR, FoxP3, CD303,CD86 labeling. Early apoptosis was evaluated using Annexin V and late apoptosis was assessed using Propidium Iodid. Result significance was evaluated using Wilcoxon signed paired test. Result(s): Procedures were performed in 12 patients with chronic GVHD (4 females, 8 males; median age 44, range 20-67 years). Thirty nine open-loop procedures and 24 (table present) closed-loop paired procedures were subjected to analysis. Results of cell collection and apoptosis are shown in Tables 1 and 2, respectively. Median Hct levels were similar in collections obtained using Spectra Optia and Cellex devices (2.2 and 2.1, respectively). No difference in apoptosis was observed between the use of Theraflex-ECP and PIT UVA illumination system. Conclusion(s): The current study demonstrated significant differences between the two ECP modalities. Despite its longer duration, the open-loop procedure resulted in significantly higher mean total MNC amount and provided a significantly higher number of early apoptotic cells in lymphocyte and monocyte gates both before and after UVA irradiation. This finding may be attributed to difference in device design. The results obtained suggest that the open-loop procedure could be efficiently employed in patients with GVHD.",Excluded

This study used an autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) model to simulate the prevalence of nosocomial infections in the Department of Critical Care Medicine of Guizhou Province. We also provided a policy basis for the prevention and control of hospital infection in the Department of Critical Care Medicine of Guizhou Province. Method(s): The data of ventilator-associated pneumonia, vascular catheter-related bloodstream infections, and urinary tract intubation-related urinary tract infections in nine tertiary A comprehensive treatment hospitals in Guizhou province from January 2014 to December 2019 were collected. The ARIMA time series model was used to evaluate the model fitting and prediction effects. Result(s): After comparison, in the Department of Critical Care Medicine of Guizhou Province, the unsurpassed model of ventilator-associated pneumonia was the ARIMA (0,1,1) model, with a residual Ljuing-Box Q test result of Q=10.832 (P=0.865), suggesting it is a white noise sequence and its simulation and prediction effects are beneficial. The best model of vascular catheter-related bloodstream infection was the ARIMA (0,0,1) model, with a residual Ljuing-Box Q test result of Q=14.914 (P=0.602). These results suggest that it is a white noise sequence, and its simulation and prediction effects are sufficient. The optimal model of urinary tract intubation-related urinary tract infection is ARIMA (1,0,0), and the residual Ljuing-Box Q test result is Q=15.042 (P=0.592), suggesting it is a white noise sequence with an accurate simulation and prediction effect. Conclusion(s): The ARIMA model can accurately simulate and predict nosocomial infection incidence rate in the Department of Critical Care Medicine of Guizhou Province, and can provide a reference for the prevention and control of nosocomial infections.Copyright © Annals of Translational Medicine.

Image quality was evaluated objectively as signal-to-noise ratio (SNR)/contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR) measurement and subjectively by two experienced, independent readers using 3-point Likert scales. CT dose index volume (CTDIvol) and dose-length product (DLP) were extracted from dose reports, and effective dose was calculated. Result(s): With the tested parameter settings we achieved effective doses below 1 mSv (median 0.5 mSv, IQR: 0.2 mSv, range: 0.3-0.9 mSv) in all 36 patients. Thirty-four patients had typical COVID-19 findings. Both readers were confident regarding the typical COVID-19 CT-characteristics in all cases (3 +/- 0). Objective image quality parameters were: SNRnormal lung: 17.0 +/- 5.9, CNRGGO/normal lung: 7.5 +/- 5.0, and CNRconsolidation/normal lung: 15.3 +/- 6.1. Conclusion(s): With the tested parameters, we achieved applied doses in the submillisievert range, on two different CT scanners without sacrificing diagnostic confidence regarding COVID-19 findings.Copyright © 2020 The Author(s)",Excluded
1578,"An observational study of personal ultraviolet dosimetry and acute diffuse reflectance skin changes at extreme altitude To determine the level of UV radiation at extreme altitude and to assess the effect it has on the skin. Fifteen expeditioners and 10 Sherpas were assessed during a climbing expedition on the north side of Mt Everest (8848 m). UV exposure measurement and diffuse skin reflectance spectrophotometry were performed at the beginning and end of the expedition. Over the course of the expedition, the expeditioners and Sherpas received a median dose of 93.6 (interquartile range [IQR], 61.0-102.8) and 102.5 (IQR, 72.2-117.8) minimal erythemal doses (MEDs) of UV radiation. The maximum dosage exceeded 106 +/- 1.4 MEDs. Using reflectance spectrophotometry, expeditioner and Sherpa melanin-hemoglobin increased by 83.6% (IQR, -1.5 to 89.8%) and 24.7% (IQR, -22.4 to 61.5%) for exposed skin, respectively. The amount of subcutaneous lipid-water decreased by a factor of 196.6 (IQR, 52.1-308.4) and 46.7 (IQR, 1.8-1156.5), for expeditioners and Sherpas, respectively. This expedition's participants received massive doses of UV radiation during their time at high altitude. In many individuals this was similar to the annual exposure of northern European office-workers (100 MEDs). Diffuse skin reflectance spectroscopy revealed considerable subcutaneous lipid loss, skin dehydration, and increased melanin in keeping with these levels of exposure.

912,"Radiotherapy for nodal recurrence after chemoradiotherapy for esophageal carcinoma Background. To evaluate the treatment outcome of radiotherapy for nodal recurrence after definitive chemoradiotherapy for esophageal carcinoma. Methods. Between 1996 and 2001, ten patients with isolated nodal recurrence after definitive chemoradiotherapy received radiotherapy with or without chemotherapy. The site of recurrence was the mediastinum in five patients, the celiac node in four patients, and the supraclavicular fossa in one patient. All sites of nodal recurrence were outside the previous irradiated area and without local recurrence or distant metastases. Radiotherapy was given with three-dimensional conformal technique, and an average total dose was 60 Gy. Eight patients received chemotherapy concurrently with radiotherapy. Chemotherapy consisted of two cycles of cisplatin and 5-FU. Results. The control rate of the irradiated region was eight of ten patients. The size of all controlled lesions was 3 cm or less in diameter. In five patients, distant metastases developed to other organs and caused death. Two patients survived without disease for 5 years and three patients survived 2 years or more. In four patients with an interval of 2 years or longer between the previous treatment and nodal recurrence, three patients survived without disease. Improvement of clinical symptoms such as dysphagia or hoarseness was obtained in five of six patients. Conclusions. Radiotherapy for isolated nodal recurrence of esophageal carcinoma after definitive chemoradiotherapy is suggested to be safe and effective. This treatment is promising as well as palliative. © Japan Esophageal Society and Springer-Verlag 2005.",Excluded

1758,"Hypofractionated volumetric modulated arc therapy (VMAT) for fragile patients with oesophageal cancer Purpose: To evaluate the feasibility, safety, and dosimetric results of volumetric modulated arc therapy (VMAT) to deliver hypofractionated radiotherapy (RT) in oesophageal cancer patients, unfit for a multimodality curative strategy. Patients/methods: From 2010 to 2017, 22 patients were treated with hypofractionated VMAT for palliative/symptomatic setting. The prescription dose was 40 Gy in 16 fractions (EQD2 41.7 Gy considering an alpha/beta ratio of 10 Gy, and 44 Gy considering an alpha/beta ratio of 3 Gy). Result(s): Eight patients (36%) were symptomatic for grade 3 baseline dysphagia. RT was generally well tolerated, and no patient interrupted the daily treatment. Acute toxicity was generally mild; no G3 acute toxicities were reported. At the end of treatment, 5 patients (22.7%) experienced a stable dysphagia and 14 (63.6%) an improvement of baseline dysphagia, while 3 patients (13.7%) reported a worsening of oesophagitis. At a mean follow-up of 8.7 months, 15 patients (79%) had a complete clinical recovery (G0-1) of the symptomatic moderate/severe dysphagia. At 3 months after the end of RT, seven patients (31.8%) achieved a partial or complete response. Two coplanar arcs were employed for VMAT delivery. Dosimetric results were consistent in terms of both target coverage and normal tissue sparing. Finally, 1-year progression-free and overall survival was 20% and 27.3%, respectively. Conclusion(s): Hypofractionated VMAT was feasible, safe, and effective to deliver symptomatic radiation in locally advanced oesophageal cancer patients, non-suitable for a standard curative treatment.Copyright © 2020, Federacion de Sociedades Espanolas de Oncologia (FESEO).",Excluded
2757,"Factors associated with acute and late dysphagia in the DAHANCA 6 & 7 randomized trial with accelerated radiotherapy for head and neck cancer BACKGROUND: Dysphagia is a common and debilitating side effect in head and neck radiotherapy (RT). Prognostic factors are numerous and their interrelationship not well understood. The aim of this study was to establish a multivariate prognostic model for acute and late dysphagia after RT, based on information from a prospective trial., MATERIAL AND METHODS: The DAHANCA 6&7 randomized study included 1476 patients with head and neck cancer eligible for primary RT alone. Patients were randomized between 5 and 6 weekly fractions of conventional RT, and received 62-70 Gy in 31-35 fractions. Patients were scored for dysphagia weekly during treatment and at regular intervals until five years after treatment. Dysphagia scores were available from 1461 patients., RESULTS: Acute dysphagia according to DAHANCA grades 1, 2, 3 and 4 occurred in 83%, 71%, 43% and 23%, respectively. Severe dysphagia occurred in 47% and 38% of patients receiving accelerated or conventional radiotherapy, respectively (p = 0.001). At one, two, three, four and five years the prevalence of chronic dysphagia above grade 0, was 46%, 32%, 29%, 24%, 23%, respectively with no difference between 5 and 6 fractions. In multivariate analysis, the following parameters were independent factors for severe acute dysphagia: T3-T4 tumors, N-positive disease, non-glottic cancer, age> median, baseline dysphagia > 1 and accelerated radiotherapy. The following factors were prognostic factors for late dysphagia: non-glottic cancer, T3-T4, N-positive disease and baseline dysphagia > 1. The data confirmed previously published predictive models, as it was possible to separate patients in groups with low, medium and high risk of dysphagia, respectively, based on pre-treatment risk scores., CONCLUSION: Prognostic models were established to characterize patients at risk of developing acute or late dysphagia in the DAHANCA 6&7 trial. The results may be useful to identify patients at risk of dysphagia and thus candidates for prophylactic measures against swallowing dysfunction.",Excluded
2709,"A retrospective multicenter study of carbon-ion radiotherapy for major salivary gland carcinomas: Subanalysis of J-CROS 1402 HN A retrospective multicenter study was carried out to assess the clinical outcomes of carbon-ion radiotherapy for head and neck malignancies (Japan Carbon-Ion Radiation Oncology Study Group [J-CROS] study: 1402 HN). We evaluated the safety and efficacy of carbon-ion radiotherapy in patients with major salivary gland carcinoma. Sixty-nine patients treated with carbon-ion radiotherapy at four Japanese institutions were analyzed. Thirty-three patients (48%) had adenoid cystic carcinomas, 10 (14%) had mucoepidermoid carcinomas, and 26 (38%) had other disease types. Three patients (4%) had T1 disease, 8 (12%) had T2, 25 (36%) had T3, and 33 (48%) had T4. The median radiation dose was 64 Gy (relative biological effectiveness) in 16 fractions. The median gross tumor volume was 27 mL. The median follow-up period was 32.7 months. The 3-year local control rate and overall survival rate were 81% and 94%, respectively. Regarding acute toxicities, seven patients had grade 3 mucositis and seven had grade 3 dermatitis. Regarding late toxicities, one patient had grade 3 dysphagia and one had a grade 3 brain abscess. No grade 4 or worse late reactions were observed. In conclusion, definitive carbon-ion radiotherapy was effective with acceptable toxicity for major salivary gland carcinomas.Copyright © 2018 The Authors.

650,"Gender difference in the development of ischemic heart disease in emergency workers of the Chernobyl accident Objectives: Since women accounted for only 8.7% of the total number of Chernobyl emergency workers (EW), the radiation effect on cardiovascular system was previously studied mainly in men. So the goal of current investigation was to determine the development of ischemic heart disease (IHD) in men and women exposed to ionizing radiation. Method(s): The study included 598 EW of 1986 year (472 men and 126 women) who had no signs of cardiac pathology during they took part in elimination of consequences caused by the Chernobyl accident. For that time women's age was 41+/-6.9 years, but men 37.8+/-8.5 years (p=0.011). The female group was also significantly older than the male at the time of the examination (69.1+/-7.2 versus 63.7+/-10.4, p=0). Patients of both groups in 2012-2016 after admission in our hospital had cardiologist examination, electrocardiography, daily monitoring of electrocardiogram, echocardiography. Result(s): At the time of examination IHD in women was more often combined with arterial hypertension (94.4% compared to 87.7% in men, p=0.001), diabetes mellitus (27.0% vs. 23.9% in men, p=0.828), alimentary obesity (57.1% vs. 39.2%, p=0) and hypercholesterolemia (66.7% versus 60.4%, p=0.239). In both groups, the portion of patients with stroke was practically equal (9.5% and 9.7%) as well as with blockade (2.4% and 2.3%), atrial fibrillation (16.7% and 16.5%), and ventricular extrasystoles (7.9% and 7%). Men were more likely to have supraventricular arrhythmias (13.3% and 1.6%, p=0.042) and higher number of smokers (40.9% and 1.6%, p=0). It was shown that 25% of all male EW developed IHD in 11.7+/-0.5 years after irradiation, while the same number of EW-women after 15.5+/-1.3 years. Exactly half of male group had the diagnosis of IHD after 18.7+/-0.8 years while women after 21.6+/-0.7 years. After 24.7+/-0.4 and 26.8+/-0.5 years, IHD developed in 75% of men and women, respectively. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis showed high reliability of differences in the development of IHD in two examined groups (logrank test: chi<sup>2</sup> = 10.001, p=0,001). The median survival rate fell on the age of 57+/-0.6 years for men and 61.4+/-0.9 years of women. Conclusion(s): The gender specific features of IHD development in EW consisted in its earlier term of onset after irradiation in men than in women. Men developed IHD at younger age than women despite the presence of a greater number of people with risk factors such as hypertension, diabetes mellitus, hypercholesterolemia and obesity.",Included

Materials: The medical charts of 17 patients with paranasal or nasal cavity malignancies treated by robotic radiosurgery (RRS)+/- external beam radiotherapy were assessed in this retrospective study. Robotic radiosurgery was given with CyberKnife (Accuray Inc., Sunnyvale, CAl. There were 9 male and 8 female patients. Primary site was maxillary sinus in 6 patients, ethmoid sinus in 5 patients, nasal cavity in 3 patients and sphenoid sinus in 1 patient. Histopatholigal diagnosis was mostly squamous cell cancer (7 cases), as other pathologies were soft tissue sarcoma (4 cases), malignant melanoma (3 cases), adenocarcinoma (1 case), and adenoid cystic carcinoma (2 cases). RRS was given as re-Irradiation in 4 patients with recurrent disease, whereas it was primary treatment modality in 13 patients (RRS alone in 7 cases with 28.5-37.5 Gy in 3-5 fractions, and boost dose after EBRT in 6 cases with 1535 Gy in 35 fractions). The median prescription isodose was 81% (range, 75-85%). Seven patients received chemotherapy either prior to RRS (3 patients), or concurrent with EBRT (3 patients), or adjuvant (1 patient). Two cases with T4 tumors received elective neck EBRT. Result(s): Median follow-up time was 21 months (7-32 months). Complete response, partial response and stabile response was obtained in 7, 3 and 2 patients respectively. Overall response rate was 59% (Complete and partial response). Progression at primary site was observed in 3 cases, as one of them died of disease and two of them died of distant metastasis. RRS was generally well tolerated. There were no grade III-IV acute RTOG toxicity. Osteoradionecrosis was detected in 2 patients (one case receiving re-irradiat ion, other case receiving 30 Gy RRS alone in 3 fractions). Those 2 patients had also serious ipsilate ral facial pain requiring narcotic analgesics, and they also received hyperbaric oxygen therapy and antibiotic therapy with no need of surgical debridement. No visual acuity loss was observed during follow-up. Minor bleeding, which was spontaneously stopped, was seen in one patient. Conclusion(s): Robotic radiosurgery seems to be an alternative and tolerable therapeutic option either in recurrent or primary paranasal sinus and nasal cavity malignancies. However, longer follow-up periods are required to see the safety of RRS particulary in terms of late effects.",Excluded

861,"Different trend for changing of mammalian plasma (serum) antioxidant activity after irradiation at large and low-doses One of the path for research of antioxidant status in vivo is the determination of blood plasma (serum) antioxidant activity (AOA). AOA is an integral parameter for the contribution of different antiradical defense components which particular nomenclature is determined by a used method of definition. In the present work AOA is studied with usage of a system of suppression in vitro by blood plasma (serum) of a Fe(2+)-induced oxidation of a substrate from egg yolk lipoproteins. The contribution of separate components of a blood plasma to an integral index of AOA for human blood serum is studied. Urine acid, albumin, reduced glutathione, ascorbat, heparin, peroxidase and catalase had no activity. Apo-beta-lipoprotein, vitamin E, ceruloplasmin and transferring are introduce, possibly, the main contribution to AOA. The significant decrease of AOA was revealed after acute irradiation by gamma-rays of dogs (4.05 Gy) and mice (6 Gy). The irradiation of mice at low-dose (0.2 Gy), vice-versa, result to stimulation of AOA with clear peak value on 5 day.

333,"Integration of functional MRI and white matter tractography in stereotactic radiosurgery clinical practice PURPOSE: To study the efficacy of the integration of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and diffusion tensor imaging tractography data into stereotactic radiosurgery clinical practice., METHODS AND MATERIALS: fMRI and tractography data sets were acquired and fused with corresponding anatomical MR and computed tomography images of patients with arteriovenous malformation (AVM), astrocytoma, brain metastasis, or hemangioma and referred for stereotactic radiosurgery. The acquired data sets were imported into a CyberKnife stereotactic radiosurgery system and used to delineate the target, organs at risk, and nearby functional structures and fiber tracts. Treatment plans with and without the incorporation of the functional structures and the fiber tracts into the optimization process were developed and compared., RESULTS: The nearby functional structures and fiber tracts could receive doses of >50% of the maximum dose if they were excluded from the planning process. In the AVM case, the doses received by the Broadmann-17 structure and the optic tract were reduced to 700 cGy from 1,400 cGy and to 1,200 cGy from 2,000 cGy, respectively, upon inclusion into the optimization process. In the metastasis case, the motor cortex received 850 cGy instead of 1,400 cGy; and in the hemangioma case, the pyramidal tracts received 780 cGy instead of 990 cGy. In the astrocytoma case, the dose to the motor cortex bordering the lesion was reduced to 1,900 cGy from 2,100 cGy, and therefore, the biologically equivalent dose in three fractions was delivered instead., CONCLUSIONS: Functional structures and fiber tracts could receive high doses if they were not considered during treatment planning. With the aid of fMRI and tractography images, they can be delineated and spared. Copyright (c) 2010 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.",Excluded

Most of these tissues were radioprotected, and the degree of radioprotection depended on the dose of WR-2721 and the time interval between administration of WR-2721 and radiation treatment. WR-2721 increased resistance of jejunal epithelial cells and spermatogenic cells to single doses of gamma-rays by factors of 1.64 and 1.54, respectively. Protection against hair loss was less pronounced; the dose-modifying factor here was 1.24. The radiation-induced acute damage of the lung expressed by the increased formation of tumor nodules in the lung was not decreased by treatment of animals with WR-2721 before radiation. In contrast, WR-2721 augmented the radiation-induced enhancement of metastasis formation in the lung.

Genetically determined mutagen sensitivity predisposes individuals to a variety of cancers, including glioma. However, polymorphisms in DNA strand break repair genes that may determine mutagen sensitivity are not well studied in cancer risk, especially in gliomas., METHODS: We correlated genotype data for tag single-nucleotide polymorphisms (tSNPs) of DNA strand break repair genes with a gamma-radiation-induced mutagen sensitivity phenotype [expressed as mean breaks per cell (B/C)] in samples from 426 glioma patients. We also conducted analysis to assess joint and haplotype effects of single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) on mutagen sensitivity. We further validate our results in an independent external control group totaling 662 subjects., RESULTS: Of the 392 tSNPs examined, we found that mutagen sensitivity was modified by one tSNP in the EME2 gene and six tSNPs in the RAD51L1 gene (P < 0.01). Among the six RAD51L1 SNPs tested in the validation set, one (RAD51L1 rs2180611) was significantly associated with mutagen sensitivity (P = 0.025). Moreover, we found a significant dose-response relationship between the mutagen sensitivity and the number of adverse tSNP genotypes. Furthermore, haplotype analysis revealed that RAD51L1 haplotypes F-A (zero adverse allele) and F-E (six adverse alleles) exhibited the lowest (0.42) and highest (0.93) mean B/C values, respectively. A similar dose-response relationship also existed between the mutagen sensitivity and the number of adverse haplotypes., CONCLUSION: These results suggest that polymorphisms in and haplotypes of the RAD51L1 gene, which is involved in the double-strand break repair pathway, modulate gamma-radiation-induced mutagen sensitivity.",Included
2349,"Development and evaluation of solid lipid nanoparticles of n-6-furfuryl adenine for prevention of photoaging N-6-furfuryl adenine (N6FA) also known as ""kinetin"" is a biologically active natural phytochemical. It belongs to the category of cytokinins, the natural plant growth hormones that promote cell division and play role in cell differentiation. Overall, N6FA aids in increasing the plant's life span. Human cells also contain small quantities of N6FA. Scientists are trying to understand its function in humans. N6FA is being investigated for its properties such as antiplatelet, antioxidant, antiproliferative and anti-aging effects on human cells. The aim of the present investigation was to prepare solid lipid nanoparticle (SLN) based topical formulations of N6FA and to evaluate its efficacy against ultraviolet (UV) radiation induced skin photodamage. SLNs were prepared by hot microemulsion technique and optimized for the type and concentration of lipid and surfactant(s). The optimized SLN formulation was characterized in terms of particle size, drug entrapment efficiency, zeta potential and pH; evaluated for stability, spreadability, ex-vivo skin permeation and photoprotective effects against UV induced skin damage. The cumulative amount of drug permeated through mice skin using SLNs was 3 folds higher than from conventional cream base. The results of biochemical and histopathological investigations of skin treated with N6FA loaded SLNs clearly demonstrated the efficacy of optimized formulation in preventing photodamage (lesions, ulcers and changes in skin integrity) due to chronic UV exposure. The effects were comparable with widely used marketed formulation, Garnier wrinkle lift anti-aging cream. Results suggested that N6FA incorporated into SLNs may provide therapeutic as well as cosmeceutical benefits.Copyright © 2015 American Scientific Publishers All rights reserved.",Excluded
1662,"Frameless Stereotactic Radiosurgery for Treatment of Multiple Sclerosis-Related Trigeminal Neuralgia Background Trigeminal neuralgia (TN) affects 7% of patients with multiple sclerosis (MS). In such patients, TN is difficult to manage either pharmacologically and surgically. Radiosurgical rhizotomy is an effective treatment option. The nonisocentric geometry of radiation beams of CyberKnife introduces new concepts in the treatment of TN. Its efficacy for MS-related TN has not yet been demonstrated. Methods Twenty-seven patients with refractory TN and MS were treated. A nonisocentric beams distribution was chosen; the maximal target dose was 72.5 Gy. The maximal dose to the brainstem was <12 Gy. Effects on pain, medications, sensory disturbance, rate, and time of pain recurrence were analyzed. Results Median follow-up was 37 (18-72) months. Barrow Neurological Institute pain scale score I-III was achieved in 23/27 patients (85%) within 45 days. Prescription isodose line (80%) accounting for a dose of 58 Gy incorporated an average of 4.85 mm (4-6 mm) of the nerve and mean nerve volume of 26.4 mm3 (range 20-38 mm3). Seven out of 27 patients (26%) had mild, not bothersome, facial numbness (Barrow Neurological Institute numbness score II). The rate of pain control decreased progressively after the first year, and only 44% of patients retained pain control 4 years later. Conclusions Frameless radiosurgery can be effectively used to perform retrogasserian rhizotomy. Pain relief was satisfactory and, with our dose/volume constraints, no sensory complications were recorded. Nonetheless, long-term pain control was possible in less than half of the patients. This is a limitation that CyberKnife radiosurgery shares with other techniques in MS patients.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Inc.",Excluded

Aim To test the association of UV exposure with the rates and severity of IBD hospitalisation. Methods We conducted a retrospective nationwide analysis of 649 932 Crohn's disease (CD), 384 267 ulcerative colitis (UC), and 288 894 297 non-IBD hospitalisations in the US between 1998 and 2010. Mean UV exposure was assigned to each hospitalisation using surface measures from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. Relative rates across UV exposures were estimated for IBD hospitalisations, prolonged hospitalisations, bowel surgeries and deaths. Results Among IBD patients, lower UV exposures had increased hospitalisation rates for CD (217.8 vs. 182.5 per 100 000 overall hospitalisations with low and very high UV, respectively; P trend <0.001) and UC (123.2 vs. 113.8 per 100 000; P trend = 0.033). Low UV groups had greater relative rates of prolonged hospitalisations [CD: 1.13, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.07-1.19; UC: 1.21, 95% CI 1.13-1.30], bowel surgeries (CD: 1.24, 95% CI 1.16-1.32; UC: 1.21, 95% CI 1.09-1.33), and CD deaths (CD: 1.76, 95% CI 1.14-2.71; UC: 1.24, 95% CI 0.92-1.67). Among non-IBD patients, low UV was associated with prolonged hospitalisations (1.09; 95% CI 1.07-1.11) and deaths (1.13; 95% CI 1.09-1.17), but not bowel surgeries (1.01; 95% CI 0.99-1.03). Conclusions Lower ultraviolet exposure is associated with greater rates of hospitalisation, prolonged hospitalisation and the need for bowel surgery in IBD.

Prolonged weightlessness induces physiologic deconditioning that questions the ability of ill or injured astronauts to tolerate IAH. On earth, IAH results in marked ventilatory embarrassment. As there has been no previous study of physiologic changes related to LS in weightlessness, we studied anesthetized pigs in parabolic flight., DESIGN: Parabolic flight research laboratory., SUBJECTS: Five anesthetized Yorkshire pigs., INTERVENTIONS: Subjects were transported from an animal care facility and secured aboard an aircraft capable of generating hypergravity and weightlessness. Mechanical ventilation was performed using pressure control and positive end-expiratory pressure at 15 and 2 cm H2O, respectively; rate 12 breaths/min. Three abdominal conditions were used during LS: insufflation to produce IAH, abdominal wall retraction (AWR), and no abdominal wall manipulation (baseline). During each parabola breath by breath-tidal volumes (Vt) were recorded by a transport ventilator (HT-50 Newport Medical)., MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Least square means (LS-means) of weight corrected Vt (milliliter per kilogram) by gravity (g) and abdominal condition were determined using a mixed effects model for repeated measures analysis. Increasing gravity (g) consistently reduced Vt (p = 0.0011) as did insufflation (p < 0.0001). In 1g, Vt (LS-mean 13.7, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 12.4-15.0) was relatively unaffected by AWR (LS-mean 12.8, 95% CI: 11.5-14.00), but markedly decreased by IAH (LS-mean 10.00, 95% CI: 8.9-11.1), an effect accentuated in hypergravity (LS-mean 8.1, 95% CI: 6.4-9.8). In weightlessness, Vt reduction during insufflation was near obviated (LS-mean 12.3, 95% CI: 10.6-14.1), and AWR regularly but inconsistently increased the Vt above 1g baseline (LS-mean 13.7, 95% CI: 11.7-15.8)., CONCLUSIONS: Weightlessness protects against thoracic compliance changes that are inherent in IAH during induced pneumoperitoneum in gravity. The technique-related physiologic cost of performing LS in space deconditioned astronauts should be incorporated into design concepts for space surgery systems.",Excluded
2220,"Pelvic Ring Fragility Fractures: A Debilitationg Fracture Occurring in Elderly Ambulatory Patients with Monoclonal Gammopathy of Uncertain Significance, Pernicious Anemia, Hyponatremia, and Associated with High Mortality PURPOSE: To study the clinical characteristics and course of a cohort of patients presenting with pelvic ring fragility fractures(PFF). METHOD(S): A retrospective chart review of 43 patients with PFF seen over a 4 year period in a community based outpatient fracture clinic was conducted. A complete history and physical, review of medical records and x-rays, CBC, chemistry profile, TSH, urinalysis, vitamin B12, 25-OH vitamin D, PTH, and immunofixation(IMF) was done in all patients. Antiparietal cell(APA) and intrinsic factor(IF) antibody and SPE was done in select cases. Comorbidity including history of solid tumor, diabetes, COPD, cardiac and neurologic disorder were tabulated. RESULT(S): There were 38 females and 5 males ranging in age 55-95 years(mean 82.3). 23 patients had a previous major osteoporotic fracture and 8 a total hip replacement. 17 had received previous osteoporosis treatment. 40 patients were living at home and 22 were still driving within 3 months prior to the fall causing the PFF. 13 were using ambulatory aids. Patients had 0-3(mean 0.93) comorbid conditions: COPD-11, cardiac-11, cancer-7, neurologic-6, and diabetes-5. 2 patients had previous radiation therapy to the pelvic area. The BMI was 20< in 9 patients and 19 had peripheral neuropathy(PN). CT or MRI confirmed the PFF in 37 patients and showed fractures of the sacrum-17, acetabulum-7, and both sacrum and acetabulum-5 in addition to the pelvic rami. Monoclonal protein was found with IMF in 17(42%) patients: IgG-7, IgG-6, and light chains-4. M-spike was found in 8. 5(14%) patients had low vitamin B12 and either APA or IF. 3 patients had vitamin D levels 20<ng/ml and 7 had hyponatremia. Alkaline phosphatase was elevated in 12 patients. 29 patients required rehabilitation in a nursing home. During follow up (mean 20.7 months) 12(31%) patients died,10 within 1 year after PFF from causes unrelated to the fracture. CONCLUSION(S): PFF occurs predominantly in female, elderly, independent and active patients with few comorbid conditions and is associated with significant morbidity. PFF may be a prelude to mortality within 1 year of occurrence. CT or MRI scans are necessary to define the full extent of injury to the pelvis. Although the clinical characteristics may differ between PFF, hip, and vertebral fracture patients, they all share age related conditions such as low BMI, PN, MGUS, pernicious anemia and hyponatremia that predispose to falling and bone fragility.",Excluded
3249,"Untreated male osteoporosis: Case report Objective: To underline problems connected with osteoporosis in men through case report. There are need to clarify the pathogenesis of osteoporosis and fractures in men and to develop diagnostic criteria as well as establish most effective treatment. Material(s) and Method(s): After low intensive trauma 64 years old man had back pain and pain in left forearm. X-ray show fractures of Th 12 and L2 vertebrae and left forearm. In his personal history there is also after low intensive trauma elbow and hip fracture in ages of 52 and 53. There are no other risk factor in personal and family history. DXA evaluation results: T-score total LS vertebrae -4.7 SD and T-score total -2.4 healthy hip. Laboratory tests: high rate of thyroid hormone and low rate of 25OH vitamin D. We started with treatment. Result(s): Osteoporosis is leading causes of morbidity and mortality in elderly. "" Silent disease"" progress without symptoms until a fractures occurred. Hip fracture is very serious complication. One fifth of it occurred in men but it rise about 10 years later than in woman. In 65-70 ages men loosing bone mass at the same rate as woman and the absorption of calcium decrease in both sex. For men before 65 years and high risk men recommendation is to begin periodic osteoporotic risk assessment and performing DXA. When we have diagnosis it is important to consider and exclude secondary causes of bone loss. It is almost certain lifestyle, diseases and medications. More than 40 % are primary or idiopathic osteoporosis in men. Careful history, physical examination and laboratory tests are enough component for making decision about treatment. Except medication men should be educated about adequate lifestyle measures as the prevention. Conclusion(s): Osteoporosis in men is an important and often overlooked problem. The consequences of it are underestimated and the condition is often unrecognised and untreated. There is no sufficient scientific based evidence for men osteoporosis. It is still an important public health problem.",Excluded
192,"Apparent migration of implantable port devices: normal variations in consideration of BMI PURPOSE: To evaluate the extent of normal variation in implantable port devices between supine fluoroscopy and upright chest x-ray in relation to body mass index (BMI) based on three different measurement methods.
METHODS: Retrospectively, 80 patients with implanted central venous access port systems from 2012-01-01 until 2013-12-31 were analyzed. Three parameters (two quantitative and one semi-quantitative) were determined to assess port positions: projection of port capsule to anterior ribs (PCP) and intercostal spaces, ratio of extra- and intravascular catheter portions (EX/IV), normalized distance of catheter tip to carina (nCTCD). Changes were analyzed for males and females and normal-weight and overweight patients using analysis of variance with Bonferroni-corrected pairwise comparison.
RESULTS: PCP revealed significantly greater changes in chest x-rays in overweight women than in the other groups (p&lt;0.001, F-test). EX/IV showed a significantly higher increase in overweight women than normal-weight women and men and overweight men (p&lt;0.001). nCTCD showed a significantly greater increase in overweight women than overweight men (p = 0.0130). There were no significant differences between the other groups. Inter- and intra-observer reproducibility was high (Cronbach alpha of 0.923-1.0) and best for EX/IV.
CONCLUSIONS: Central venous port systems show wide normal variations in the projection of catheter tip and port capsule. In overweight women apparent catheter migration is significantly greater compared with normal-weight women and with men. The measurement of EX/IV and PCP are straightforward methods, quick to perform, and show higher reproducibility than measurement of catheter tip-to-carina distance.",Excluded

1128,"Acute effects of the electromagnetic waves emitted by mobile phones on attention in emergency physicians STUDY OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to investigate the acute effects of the electromagnetic waves (EMW) emitted by mobile phones on attention in emergency physicians., METHODS: This single-center, prospective, randomized, double-blinded clinical study was performed among emergency physicians in a tertiary hospital. Thirty emergency physicians were enrolled in the study. Initial d2 test was applied in the evaluation of attention and concentration of all the physicians, who were randomly assigned into one of two groups. The control group members hold mobile phones in 'off' mode to their left ears for 15min. The members of the intervention group hold mobile phones in 'on' mode to their left ears for 15min, thus exposing them to 900-1800MHz EMW. The d2 test was re-applied to both groups after this procedure. Differences in attention and concentration levels between the groups were compared., RESULTS: Difference between initial and final d2 test in total performance (TN-E, p=0.319), in total number of figures marked (TN, p=0.177), in test performance percentile (PR, p=0.619) and in attention fluctuation (FR, p=0.083) were similar between the groups. However, difference in the number of figures missed (E1 selective attention, p=0.025), difference between numbers of incorrectly marked figures (E2, p=0,018) and difference in focus levels (E, p=0.016) were significantly in favor of the intervention group., CONCLUSION: According to our study findings, the EMW emitted by mobile phones has no deleterious effect on the attention and concentration levels of emergency physicians, and even has a positive impact on selective attention levels.

741,"Abdominal applications of 3.0-T MR imaging: comparative review versus a 1.5-T system With the development of dedicated receiver coils and increased gradient performance, 3.0-T magnetic resonance (MR) systems are gaining wider acceptance in clinical practice. The expected twofold increase in signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) compared with that of 1.5-T MR systems may help improve spatial resolution or increase temporal resolution when used with parallel acquisition techniques. Several issues must be considered when applying 3.0-T MR in the abdomen, including the alteration of the radiofrequency field and relaxation time, increase in energy deposition and susceptibility effects, and problems associated with motion artifacts. For the evaluation of liver lesions, higher SNR and greater resolution achieved with the 3.0-T system could translate into better detection of malignant lesions on T2-weighted images obtained with adjusted imaging parameters. For the evaluation of pancreatic and biliary diseases, high-resolution T2-weighted imaging using single-shot turbo spin-echo sequences is useful; improvement in SNR was noticeable on two-dimensional MR cholangiopancreatographic images. For the preoperative imaging of rectal cancer, a single-shot sequence is useful for dramatically decreasing imaging time while maintaining image quality. Substantial modification of examination protocols, with optimized imaging parameters and sequence designs along with ongoing development of hardware, could contribute to an increased role of the 3.0-T system for abdominal MR examinations.",Excluded
2374,"Radiation-induced malignancies after intensity-modulated versus conventional mediastinal radiotherapy in a small animal model A long-standing hypothesis in radiotherapy is that intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) increases the risk of second cancer due to low-dose exposure of large volumes of normal tissue. Therefore, young patients are still treated with conventional techniques rather than with modern IMRT. We challenged this hypothesis in first-of-its-kind experiments using an animal model. Cancer-prone Tp53+/C273X knockout rats received mediastinal irradiation with 3x5 or 3x8Gy using volumetric-modulated arc therapy (VMAT, an advanced IMRT) or conventional anterior-posterior/posterior-anterior (AP/PA) beams using non-irradiated rats as controls (n=15/group, ntotal=90). Tumors were assigned to volumes receiving 90-107%, 50-90%, 5-50%, and <5% of the target dose and characterized by histology and loss-of-heterozygosity (LOH). Irradiated rats predominantly developed lymphomas and sarcomas in areas receiving 50-107% (n=26) rather than 5-50% (n=7) of the target dose. Latency was significantly shortened only after 3x8Gy vs. controls (p<0.0001). The frequency (14/28 vs. 19/29; p=0.29) and latency (218 vs. 189 days; p=0.17) of radiation-associated tumors were similar after VMAT vs. AP/PA. LOH was strongly associated with sarcoma but not with treatment. The results do not support the hypothesis that IMRT increases the risk of second cancer. Thus the current practice of withholding dose-sparing IMRT from young patients may need to be re-evaluated.",Included
474,"Functional MR urography for assessment of obstructive and reflux uropathies Purpose - Objective. In congenital anomalies of the kidney and urinary tract (CAKUT) the role of MRI for classification is expanded by obtaining functional data. MAG3 scintigraphy is considered gold standard for functional analysis. Material and methods. From 04/2010 to 01/2012 20 patients from one university hospital were examined by a standardised MR urography (MRU) in a 1.5 Tesla scanner after i.v. hydration and furosemide i.v. The data was processed by a dedicated software (CHOP-fMRU). Results were compared with Tc99m MAG3 scintigraphy. Results. Twenty patients (5 female, 15 male; age 5 weeks to 18.4 years) had both MR urography and MAG3 scintigraphy (1 to 484; average 48 days). All patients had isolated or combined CAKUT (6 duplex kidneys; 7 proximal, 11 distal ureteral stenoses; 8 subvesical obstructions; 10 VUR). Split renal function values differed by an average 8.2 % (min 1 %, max 18 %). Curve types after O' Reilly were available in 36 kidneys (4 kidneys were multicystic dysplastic with no residual organ function). There was a relevant discrepancy in one case only (norml in scintigraphy, relevant obstruction in MRU). Discussion and conclusions. X-ray excretion urography was replaced by earlier MRU. The CHOP-fMRU examination protocol is very robust and reliable and able to give as much information as MAG3 scintigraphy. It is now possible to receive information on morphology, excretion, and split renal function with one examination.",Excluded
948,"Point-of-care ultrasound for confirmation of gastrostomy tube replacement in the pediatric emergency department Gastrostomy tubes (G-tubes) are frequently used in children for feeding and nutrition. Complications related to G-tubes (and G-buttons) in children represent a common presentation to the emergency department (ED). G-tube replacement is usually performed by pediatric emergency medicine physicians. Misplacement may lead to tract disruption, perforation, fistula tract formation, or feeding into the peritoneum. Contrast-enhanced radiographs are traditionally used for confirmation. In addition to a longer length-of-stay, repeat ED visits result in repeated radiation exposure. The use of point-of-care ultrasound (POCUS) instead of radiography avoids this exposure to ionizing radiation. Here, we describe three patients who presented with G-tube complications in whom POCUS alone performed by pediatricians was used for confirmation of the tubes' replacement. Two children presented to the ED with G-tube dislodgement, and one child presented with a ruptured balloon. In all three cases, a new G-tube was replaced at the bedside using POCUS guidance without the need for further radiographic studies. There were no known ED or clinic returns for G-tube complaints over the next 30 days. This is the first report of pediatricians using POCUS to guide and confirm G-tube replacement in children. The success of these cases suggests the technique's feasibility. Future prospective studies are needed to evaluate the learning curves, diagnostic accuracy, ED length-of-stay, and use of confirmatory imaging.",Excluded

3501,"[Optimizing dosage in thoracic computerized tomography] Radiation exposure in computed tomography (CT) by far exceeds radiation dose in chest radiography. Dose requirements in CT of the chest, however, are much smaller than for the abdomen because of low x-ray absorption in the lungs. This article describes scanner parameters that influence patient exposure and image quality. Suitable compromises will be explained that allow for dose reduction in chest CT without jeopardising image quality. Dose reduction in chest CT should be performed depending on the clinical indication and requires active reduction of mAs settings. For helical CT, a pitch of 1.5 to 2 should be employed. Dedicated low-dose techniques for screening of bronchogenic carcinoma are described. Dose reduction decreases image quality but the detrimental effects can be reduced by applying proper parameters for scanning and image reconstruction. Thus, images of the mediastinum should be reconstructed with a smoothing filter, while a higher resolution filter should be used for the lungs. In multislice CT, reconstruction of thicker axial or multiplanar sections retains spatial resolution but keeps image noise and thus dose requirements low. The effective, weighted CT dose index (CTDIw,eff) can serve as a rough estimate of the effective patient dose (E) in helical or multislice CT of the whole chest: for most scanners and age groups the conversion factors are 0.5 mSv/mGy for females and 0.4 mSv/mGy for males.",Excluded
1827,"Phase I clinical trial with fractionated radioimmunotherapy using 131I-labeled chimeric G250 in metastatic renal cancer UNLABELLED: This trial was performed to determine the maximum tolerated whole-body radiation-absorbed dose of fractionated (131)I-cG250., METHODS: This was a phase 1 dose escalation trial. Dose escalation refers here to the escalation of average whole-body absorbed dose. Fifteen patients with measurable metastatic renal cancer were studied. For each treatment cycle, patients initially received a ""scout"" administration consisting of 5 mg of cG250 antibody labeled with 185 MBq (5 mCi) of (131)I. Whole-body and serum activity was measured for 1 wk, and a simple pharmacokinetic model was fitted to the measured data. The pharmacokinetic model was used to calculate the required activities, administered in a fractionated pattern with 2-3 d between fractions, projected to deliver the prescribed whole-body absorbed dose. The initial cohort of 3 patients was prescribed an average whole-body absorbed dose of 0.50 Gy. In subsequent cohorts this was increased in 0.25-Gy increments. The first fraction in each cycle was 1,110 MBq (30 mCi) of (131)I conjugated to 5 mg of antibody. Subsequent fractions consisted of variable activities depending on the patient-specific whole-body clearance rates and the times between fractions. Patients without evidence of disease progression were retreated after recovery from toxicity if there was no evidence of altered pharmacokinetics or serum human antichimeric antibody titers, for a total of no more than 3 treatments., RESULTS: For the initial treatment course, the pharmacokinetics of the scout dose accurately predicted the pharmacokinetics of fractionated (131)I-cG250 therapy. In 2 patients, altered clearance accurately predicted development of human antichimeric antibody. Targeting to known disease >or= 2 cm in diameter was noted in all patients. Dose-limiting toxicity was hematopoietic, and the maximum tolerated dose per cycle was 0.75 Gy., CONCLUSION: Measurements of whole-body and serum clearance of cG250 antibody can be used to accurately predict the clearance of subsequent administrations, thus enabling rational treatment planning. An additional practical benefit of real-time pharmacokinetic monitoring is that therapy can be altered dynamically to reduce toxic side effects. However, there was no evidence for fractionation-induced sparing of the hematopoietic system in this study.",Excluded

This study aimed to assess the expression and activity of the gelatinases MMP-2 and MMP-9 in the DEJ and dentin-pulp complex tissues of teeth irradiated in vivo., STUDY DESIGN: Thirty-six teeth were studied, including 19 irradiated and 17 non-irradiated controls. In situ zymography was used to investigate the gelatinolytic activity in the micromorphologic components of enamel, DEJ, dentin-pulp complex, and caries. Immunohistochemical analysis was conducted on the demineralized samples to assess MMP-2 and MMP-9 expression levels in the DEJ, dentin-pulp complex components, and caries., RESULTS: No statistically significant differences were detected between groups in gelatinolytic activity or in MMP-2 expression levels (P > .05). Odontoblast MMP-9 expression was reduced in the irradiated group (P = .02)., CONCLUSIONS: The study rejected the hypothesis that MMP-2 and MMP-9 would be overexpressed or more activated in the DEJ and dentin-pulp complex of irradiated teeth.

From 2006 to 2015, 80 inoperable T1-2N0M0 NSCLC patients were treated with two median dose levels: 60 Gy in six fractions (range, 48-60 Gy in 4-8 fractions) prescribed to the 74% isodose line (range, 58%-79%) for central lesions (ie within 2 cm of, but not abutting, the proximal bronchial tree; n = 43), and 56 Gy in seven fractions (range, 48-60 Gy in 5-10 fractions) prescribed to the 74% isodose line (range, 60%-80%) for ultra-central lesions (ie abutting the proximal bronchial tree; n = 37) on consecutive days. Primary endpoint was overall survival (OS); secondary endpoints included progression-free survival (PFS), tumor local control rate (LC), and toxicity. Median OS and PFS were 64.47 and 32.10 months (respectively) for ultra-central patients, and not reached for central patients. Median time to local failure, regional failure, and any distant failures for central versus ultra-central lesions were: 27.37 versus 26.07 months, 20.90 versus 12.53 months, and 20.85 versus 15.53 months, respectively, all P <.05. Multivariate analyses showed that tumor categorization (ultra-central) and planning target volume >=52.76 mL were poor prognostic factors of OS, PFS, and LC, respectively (all P <.05). There was one grade 5 toxicity; all other toxicities were grade 1-2. Our results showed that ultra-central tumors have a poor OS, PFS, and LC compared with central patients because of the use of risk-adapted SBRT schedules that allow for equal and favorable toxicity profiles.Copyright © 2019 The Authors.

1476,"Submillisievert chest dual energy computed tomography: a pilot study OBJECTIVE: To assess if diagnostic dual energy CT (DECT) of the chest can be achieved at submillisievert (sub-mSv) doses., METHODS: Our IRB-approved prospective study included 20 patients who were scanned on dual-source multidector CT(MDCT). All patients gave written informed consent for acquisition of additional image series at reduced radiation dose on a dual-source MDCT (80/140 kV) within 10 s after the standard of care acquisition. Dose reduction was achieved by reducing the quality reference milliampere-second, with combined angular exposure control. Four readers, blinded to all clinical data, evaluated the image sets. Image noise, signal-to-noise and contrast-to-noise ratio were assessed. Volumetric CT dose index (CTDIvol), doselength product (DLP), size specific dose estimate, and effective dose were also recorded., RESULTS: The mean age and body mass index of the patients were 71 years +/- 9 and 24 kg m-2 +/- 3, respectively. Although images became noisier, overall image quality and image sharpness on blended images were considered good or excellent in all cases (20/20). All findings made on the reduced dose images presented with good demarcation. The intraobserver and interobserver agreements were kappa = 0.83 and 0.73, respectively.

3003,"Dosimetry-based treatment for Graves' disease Objective The aim of this retrospective study was to assess the long-Term outcome of a personalized dosimetry approach in Graves' disease aiming to render patients euthyroid from a planned thyroid absorbed dose of 60 Gy. Patients and methods A total of 284 patients with Graves' disease were followed prospectively following administration of radioiodine calculated to deliver an absorbed dose of 60 Gy. Patients with cardiac disease were excluded. Outcomes were analysed at yearly intervals for up to 10 years with a median follow-up of 37.5 months. Results A single radioiodine administration was sufficient to render a patient either euthyroid or hypothyroid in 175 (62%) patients, the remainder requiring further radioiodine. The median radioactivity required to deliver 60 Gy was 77 MBq. Less than 2% patients required 400-600 MBq, the standard activity administered in many centres. In the cohort receiving a single administration, 38, 32 and 26% were euthyroid on no specific thyroid medication at 3, 5 and 10 years, respectively. Larger thyroid volumes were associated with the need for further therapy. The presence of nodules on ultrasonography did not adversely affect treatment outcome. Conclusion A personalized dosimetric approach delayed the long-Term onset of hypothyroidism in 26% of patients. This was achieved using much lower administered activities than currently recommended. Future studies will aim to identify those patients who would benefit most from this approach.Copyright © 2018 The Author(s). Published by Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.",Excluded

On coronary imaging, contrast-to-noise ratios (CNRs) of the aorta and the coronaries were calculated. To assess whether CNRs differed throughout the diastolic phase, t test was used. Data triplets of CNRs and the corresponding current and circumference were plotted; CNRs less than 250 Hounsfield unit (HU) were discarded, dissecting lines as 95th percentiles correlating radiograph currents and patients' circumferences were calculated., RESULTS: Female/male weights differed significantly (P = 0.0006); circumferences based on scouts adequately reflected body weight (coefficients, 0.86 male/0.87 female). Homogenous vascular enhancement of the aorta (mean +/- SD, 344.4 +/- 81.8 HU) and the right (292.3 +/- 82.8 HU) and left (285.8 +/- 81.3 HU) coronaries was achieved (P > 0.005). Ninety-fifth percentile cutoffs identified linear relationships between patient's circumference and the minimal adequate radiograph current achieving CNR less than or equal to 250 HU., CONCLUSION: Scout imaging can be used to determine individual patient habitus; habitus-adjusted minimal radiograph tube current cutoff levels identified in this study ensuring clinically required levels of coronary enhancement can be used for future coronary CT angiography optimization of tube current based on scout imaging.",Excluded

363,"XRCC3 Thr241Met gene polymorphism and risk of colorectal cancer in Kashmir: a case control study XRCC (X-ray cross-complementing group) genes contribute to important DNA repair mechanisms that play roles in the repair of single strand breaks (SSBs) induced by a variety of external and internal factors, including ionizing radiation, alkylating agents and reactive oxygen species. These repair genes have a pivotal role in maintaining genomic stability through different pathways of base excision repair (BER). The aim of this study was to investigate the XRCC3 Thr241Met gene polymorphism in colorectal cancer (CRC) in Kashmir. We investigated the genotype distribution of XRCC3 gene in 120 CRC cases in comparison with 150 healthy subjects and found a significant association between XRCC3 genotypes and CRC (p<=0.05). Both heterozygous genotype (Thr/Met) as well as homozygous variant genotype (Met/Met) were moderately associated with elevated risk of CRC [OR=2.53; OR=2.29 respectively]. Also, Thr/Met and Met/Met genotypes demonstrated a significant association with the risk of CRC (p=0.003). This study displayed a significantly elevated risk for CRC in individuals with XRCC3 Thr/Met and Met/Met Genotype of about 2.5 times that with the Thr/Thr wild genotype.",Excluded

Influence of time between onset of motoric deficits and start of irradiation on therapeutic effect Background: In a retrospective analysis we investigated the prognostic significance of the interval between first appearance of motoric deficits and the beginning of radiation therapy (RT) with regard to posttreatment motoric function. Material(s) and Method(s): Data of more than 400 consecutive patients being irradiated at our department between 1994 and 1997 because of vertebral metastases were reviewed. Ninety-six patients fulfilled selection criteria including motoric deficits, no preceding surgical or radiotherapeutic treatment of the spine, minimum total dose of 24 Gy referred to spinal cord, and additional treatment with dexamethasone. Two subgroups with a similar number of patients for better comparability were formed according to the time of developing motoric deficits: 1 to 13 days (49 patients) and >=14 days (47 patients). Effect of irradiation on motoric function was evaluated 2 weeks and about 3 months after radiotherapy. Patients with severe deterioration of motoric function within 48 hours before radiation therapy (31 patients) were looked at separately. Result(s): Two weeks after radiotherapy 42/47 patients (89%) developing motoric deficits >= 14 days showed improvement of motoric function in comparison to 6/49 patients (12%) of the other group. Deterioration occurred in 1/47 patients (2%) of the first and in 24/49 patients (49%) of the latter group. In case of severe deterioration of motoric function within 48 hours before radiation therapy only 2/31 patients (6%) showed improvement, but 20/31 (65%) deterioration. About 3 months after radiotherapy comparable results were observed. Median survival time was 4 months. Conclusion(s): A slower development of motoric deficits before beginning of radiotherapy means a better therapeutic effect and a more favorable functional outcome after treatment. The prognosis is extraordinarily poor if severe deterioration of motoric function occurs within 48 hours before radiotherapy.",Excluded
3303,"Increased adiponectin levels are associated with higher radiographic scores in the knee joint, but not in the hand joint Several studies have evaluated the association between serum adiponectin levels and knee and hand osteoarthritis (OA); mixed results have been reported. We investigated the relationship between OA and serum adiponectin levels according to the radiographic features of knee and hand OA. A total of 2402 subjects was recruited from the Dong-gu Study. Baseline characteristics were collected via a questionnaire, and X-rays of knee and hand joints were scored using a semi-quantitative grading system. The relationship between serum adiponectin levels and radiographic severity was evaluated by linear and logistic regression analysis. Subjects in the higher serum adiponectin levels tertiles were older and had a lower body mass index (BMI) than those in the lower tertiles. Regarding knee joint scores, serum adiponectin levels was positively associated with the total (P<0.001), osteophyte (P=0.003), and joint space narrowing (JSN) scores (P<0.001) after adjustment for age, sex, BMI, smoking, alcohol consumption, education, and physical activity. In terms of hand joint scores, no association was found between serum adiponectin levels and the total, osteophyte, JSN, subchondral cyst, sclerosis, erosion, or malalignment score after the above-mentioned adjustments. Similarly, subjects with serum adiponectin levels above the median had higher total radiographic scores in the knee joints, but not in the hand joints, after adjustment. An increased serum adiponectin levels was associated with a higher radiographic score in the knee joint, but not in the hand joint, suggesting the involvement of different pathophysiologic mechanisms in the development of OA between those joints.",Excluded

The aim of the retrospective study was to evaluate the effectiveness and toxicity of radiochemotherapy in patients with squamous cell carcinoma of the anal canal treated at a single institution.Patients and methods. Between 1/2003 and 9/2010, 84 patients were treated with radical radiochemotherapy at the Institute of Oncology Ljubljana, Slovenia. The treatment consisted of 3-dimensional conformal external beam radiotherapy with concurrent chemotherapy (5-fluorouracil and mytomycin C), followed by brachytherapy or external beam boost. The toxicity of therapy and its effectiveness were assessed.Results. The treatment was completed according to the protocol in 79.8% of patients. The median follow-up time of 55 survivors was 53 months (range: 16-105 months). The 5-year locoregional control (LRC), disease-free survival (DFS), disease-specific survival (DSS), overall survival (OS) and colostomy-free survival (CFS) rates were 71%, 68%, 81%, 67% and 85%, respectively. No treatment-related mortality was observed. The most frequent acute side-effect of the treatment was radiodermatitis (grade 3-4 in 58.2% of patients). LENT-SOMA grade 3-4 late radiation side effects were observed in 15 (18%) patients. In patients with brachytherapy boost a trend of less late side effects was observed compared to patients with external beam boost (P=0.066). On multivariate analysis, complete clinical disease response was identified as an independent prognostic factor for LRC, DFS and DSS, the salvage surgery for LRC and DFS, whereas Hb below 120 g/l retained its independent prognostic value for OS.Conclusions. Radiochemotherapy provides an excellent disease control and the survival with preserving anal sphincter function in majority of patients.

1080,"Enumeration of circulating microparticles in healthy medical workers occupationally exposed to low doses of ionizing radiation Background: Strong evidence suggests microparticles (MP) as a biomarker of vascular injury. It may also contribute to the initiation and the development of atherosclerosis. In fact, several biological mechanisms might be responsible of atherosclerosis caused by radiation exposure even at a low dose. Therefore, the measurement of MP might be of a great potential for providing new insight into low-dose radiation cardiovascular risk. Aim(s): We investigated the effect of long-term medical occupational exposure to low doses of ionizing radiation (LDIR) on MP populations levels. Method(s): The current study was conducted in accordance with the Helsinki Declaration on 38 healthy medical workers occupationally exposed to LDIR and 29 matched controls by gender, age, and smoking habits. The measured MP by flow cytometry were classified as positive or negative phosphatidylserine (PS+ or PS-), and phenotyped according to their cellular origin. Result(s): Total MP (PS-/PS+), regardless of phenotype, were significantly higher in workers occupationally exposed to LDIR than controls (p=0.0004). In medical exposed workers, PS- MP predominated (68%) and were approximately three times more common than PS+ MP. Concerning the measurement of MP according to their cellular origin, we found that MP derived from platelets (CD41a+ PMP), endothelial (CD146+ EMP), leucocytes (CD45+ LMP) and erythrocytes (CD235a+ RMP) are more abundant in exposed workers than those in controls (p< 0.0001). However, no significant difference was found in the proportion of the other blood elements in the peripheral circulation between the two groups. In addition, no association was observed between MP levels and the studied confounding factors. Conclusion(s): Our results suggest that elevated circulating MP populations levels represent an indicator of cellular damage caused by medical exposure to LDIR. By consequence, the quantification of MP seems to a useful biomarker for assessing the negative effects of occupational exposure to ionizing radiation. (Figure Presented) .",Included
2526,"Arterial Stiffness as a Biomarker of Radiation-Induced Carotid Atherosclerosis Arterial stiffness is thought to be a precursor to atherosclerosis. Conventional arterial stiffness parameters as potential biomarkers of radiation-induced damage were investigated. Patients with head and neck cancer treated with radiotherapy >=2 years previously to one side of the neck were included. The unirradiated side was the internal control. Beta stiffness index (B) and elastic modulus (Ep) were used to assess arterial stiffness and were measured in proximal, mid, and distal common carotid artery (CCA) and compared with the corresponding unirradiated segments. Fifty patients (68% male; median age 58 years; interquartile range 50-62) were included. Mean +/- standard deviation maximum doses to irradiated and unirradiated arteries were 53 +/- 13 and 1.9 +/- 3.7 Gy, respectively. Differences in B were not significant. Significant differences in Ep were demonstrated-proximal CCA: 1301 +/- 1223 versus 801 +/- 492 (P < .0001), mid CCA: 1064 +/- 818 versus 935.5 +/- 793 (P < .0001), and distal CCA: 1267 +/- 1084 versus 775.3 +/- 551.9 (P < .0001).

3402,"Imbalanced MMP-3 and MMP-12 serum levels in systemic lupus erythematosus patients with Jaccoud's arthropathy and a distinctive MRI pattern OBJECTIVE: Metalloproteinase (MMP)-3 and MMP-12 are proteolytic enzymes especially implicated in joint inflammation. This study aims to evaluate their association with arthritis features and hand MRI abnormalities in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). METHOD(S): Fifty SLE patients, with a mean (SD) age of 48.1 (14.6) years were tested for MMP-3 and MMP-12 serum levels, then further classified according to the presence of X-Ray erosions and joint deformities. Eighteen rheumatoid arthritis patients aged 47.9 (11.8) and 14 healthy people aged 46.0 (11.0) were enrolled as control groups. A subgroup of 28 SLE patients underwent a dominant-hand MRI; the detected changes were classified and semiquantitatively scored as capsular swelling, synovitis, edematous or proliferative tenosynovitis, bone oedema, bone erosions. Statistical analysis was performed using multiple regression models. RESULT(S): MMP-3 were significantly higher in patients with Jaccoud's arthropathy (JA) (22.1ng/ml, p< 0.05) and independently associated with hsCRP serum levels (B-coeff 0.50; r=0.30; p< 0.05). MMP-12 serum levels were significantly lower in patients with JA (0.18ng/ml, p< 0.05) and inversely associated with the prednisone daily dose (B-coeff -0.03; r= -0.44; p< 0.01). Capsular swelling and edematous tenosynovitis, the most prevalent hand MRI changes in patients with JA, associated with higher MMP-3 (B-coeff 0.12; r=0.66; p< 0.01 and B-coeff 0.08; r=0.59; p< 0.01, respectively) and lower MMP-12 serum levels (B-coeff -7.4; r= -0.50; p< 0.05 and B-coeff -5.2; r= -0.44; p= 0.05, respectively). CONCLUSION(S): Imbalanced MMP-3 and MMP-12 serum levels are influenced by inflammation and glucocorticoids in SLE patients and associated with JA and distinctive hand MRI changes.Copyright © The Author(s) 2021.

249,"Inter-laboratory consistency and variability in the buccal micronucleus cytome assay depends on biomarker scored and laboratory experience: results from the HUMNxl international inter-laboratory scoring exercise The buccal micronucleus cytome (BMNcyt) assay in uncultured exfoliated epithelial cells from oral mucosa is widely applied in biomonitoring human exposures to genotoxic agents and is also proposed as a suitable test for prescreening and follow-up of precancerous oral lesions. The main limitation of the assay is the large variability observed in the baseline values of micronuclei (MNi) and other nuclear anomalies mainly related to different scoring criteria. The aim of this international collaborative study, involving laboratories with different level of experience, was to evaluate the inter- and intra-laboratory variations in the BMNcyt parameters, using recently implemented guidelines, in scoring cells from the same pooled samples obtained from healthy subjects (control group) and from cancer patients undergoing radiotherapy (treated group). The results indicate that all laboratories correctly discriminated samples from the two groups by a significant increase of micronucleus (MN) and nuclear bud (NBUD) frequencies and differentiated binucleated (BN) cells, associated with the exposure to ionizing radiation. The experience of the laboratories was shown to play an important role in the identification of the different cell types and nuclear anomalies. MN frequency in differentiated mononucleated (MONO) and BN cells showed the greatest consistency among the laboratories and low variability was also detected in the frequencies of MONO and BN cells. A larger variability was observed in classifying the different cell types, indicating the subjectivity in the interpretation of some of the scoring criteria while reproducibility of the results between scoring sessions was very good. An inter-laboratory calibration exercise is strongly recommended before starting studies with BMNcyt assay involving multiple research centers. Copyright © The Author 2016.

390,"Diet and melanoma in a case-control study Background: Malignant melanoma has been one of the most rapidly increasing cancers within the United States with few modifiable risk factors. This study investigates risk related to dietary factors, which are potentially modifiable. Method(s): Newly diagnosed patients with melanoma (n = 502) were recruited from pigment lesion clinics and controls (n = 565) were recruited from outpatient clinics. To investigate the relationship between melanoma and dietary factors in this case-control study, study subjects were requested to complete a food frequency questionnaire, which assessed diet over the previous year. Using logistic regression, odds ratios (ORs) for melanoma were computed for nutrient and alcohol intake. Result(s): Persons in high versus low quintiles of energy-adjusted vitamin D, alphacarotene, beta-carotene, cryptoxanthin, lutein, and lycopene had significantly reduced risk for melanoma (ORs <= 0.67), which remained after adjustment for presence of dysplastic nevi, education, and skin response to repeated sun exposure. Addition of micronutrients from supplements did not add an additional reduction in risk. High alcohol consumption was associated with an increased risk for melanoma, which remained after adjustment for confounders [OR (95% confidence interval) in highest versus lowest quintiles, 1.65 (1.09-2.49)].

The purpose of this study was to examine effects of gamma radiation on Wolbachia and reproduction in Brugia malayi adult worms. Worms were exposed to 0, 10, 25, 45, 75, and 105 krad of gamma radiation from a 137cesium source and cultured in vitro for 10 days. Irradiation reduced production of microfilariae in a dose-dependent manner. Embryograms of irradiated female worms showed dose-related abnormalities with arrested development at the early embryo stage. Irradiation reduced the viability of adult worms in a dose-dependent manner, but no lethal effect was observed. Electron microscopy studies showed that irradiation cleared Wolbachia from worm tissues. Real-time polymerase chain reaction studies demonstrated greatly reduced Wolbachia DNA in irradiated worms. These effects are essentially the same as those observed in adult worms treated with doxycycline. These studies suggest that effects of irradiation on reproduction in Brugia malayi may be caused by effects of irradiation on Wolbachia.",Included
2553,"The early causal influence of cell size upon synaptic number: the mutant gigas of Drosophila The number of synaptic contacts formed by a neuron is known to vary with its surface area. This could be because large neurons are able to establish more synaptic sites, or because those neurons that are able to establish more sites are subsequently able to enlarge. To test between these two possibilities clones of enlarged ommatidia were generated in the retina of the Drosophila mutant gigas, by mitotic recombination following gamma-irradiation in the third-instar larva. The numbers of afferent synaptic contacts formed by the photoreceptor terminals in the first optic neuropil, or lamina, were then counted in the adult. The terminals of mutant photoreceptors were also enlarged, but by varying degrees. The sizes of their profiles in single sections merged with the size distribution of terminals having a wild-type phenotype, lying outside the clone in the same lamina. A perimeter of 6.0 microns for the profiles of receptor terminal in cross section was established as a criterion for distinguishing between normal and mutant phenotypes. The mutant terminals had more presynaptic sites. Because only the gigas terminals are mutant and because they enlarged at a time long before synapse formation occurred in the lamina we may conclude that cell enlargement preceded elevated synaptic number. The increase in synaptic number roughly matched the increased membrane surface of the terminals, so as nearly to preserve a constant areal density of synaptic sites over a 5-fold range in synaptic frequency.",Excluded

Therefore, the effect of lower dose and lower dose rate remains unclear. Here we report that in Russian Mayak Production Association workers occupationally exposed to chronic radiation for prolonged periods, incidence of total primary glaucoma and primary open-angle glaucoma is significantly associated with various non-radiation factors (sex, attained age, and cataract diagnosed prior to glaucoma), but neither with cumulative dose from external gamma-rays nor with cumulative neutron dose nor with the unweighted sum of cumulative gamma and neutron doses.

1326,"The role of thiols in cellular response to radiation and drugs Cellular nonprotein thiols (NPSH) consist of glutathione (GSH) and other low molecular weight species such as cysteine, cysteamine, and coenzyme A. GSH is usually less than the total cellular NPSH, and with thiol reactive agents, such as diethyl maleate (DEM), its rate of depletion is in part dependent upon the cellular capacity for its resynthesis. If resynthesis is blocked by buthionine-S,R-sulfoximine(BSO), the NPSH, including GSH, is depleted more rapidly, Cellular thiol depletion by diamide, N-ethylmaleimide, and BSO may render oxygenated cells more sensitive to radiation. These cells may or may not show a reduction in the oxygen enhancement ratio (OER). Human A549 lung carcinoma cells depleted of their NPSH either by prolonged culture or by BSO treatment do not show a reduced OER but do show increased aerobic responses to radiation. Some nitroheterocyclic radiosensitizing drugs also deplete cellular thiols under aerobic conditions. Such reactivity may be the reason that they show anomalous radiation sensitization (i.e., better than predicted on the basis of electron affinity). Other nitrocompounds, such as misonidazole, are activated under hypoxic conditions to radical intermediates. When cellular thiols are depleted peroxide is formed. Under hypoxic conditions thiols are depleted because metabolically reduced intermediates react with GSH instead of oxygen. Thiol depletion, under hypoxic conditions, may be the reason that misonidazole and other nitrocompounds show an extra enhancement ratio with hypoxic cells. Thiol depletion by DEM or BSO alters the radiation response of hypoxic cells to misonidazole. In conclusion, we propose an altered thiol model which includes a mechanism for thiol involvement in the aerobic radiation response of cells. This mechanism involves both thiol-linked hydrogen donation to oxygen radical adducts to produce hydroperoxides followed by a GSH peroxidase-catalyzed reduction of the hydroperoxides to intermediates entering into metabolic pathways to produce the original molecule.",Excluded
2382,"Incidence of pain flare following palliative radiation therapy for symptomatic bone metastases: Multicenter prospective observational study Purpose/Objective(s): Palliative radiation therapy (RT) is a wellestablished treatment option for symptomatic bone metastases, with few treatment-related side effects. However, pain flare, a temporary worsening of bone pain in the irradiated metastatic site, has been recognized following RT. The aim of this study is to determine the incidence of pain flare following RT for painful bone metastases. Materials/Methods: Patients with bone metastases treated with RT were eligible. Worst pain scores and analgesic consumption were collected before, daily during, and for 10 days after treatment. Pain flare was defined as a 2-point increase in the worst pain score (0-10) compared to baseline with no decrease in analgesic intake, or a 25% increase in analgesic intake with no decrease in worst pain score. The Brief Pain Inventory (BPI) was administered to measure the ""sensory"" dimension of pain (intensity, or severity) and its ""reactive"" dimension (interference with daily function) before the RT treatment and at the 4-weeks follow-up evaluation. Descriptive statistics were reported. Response rate and 95% confidence intervals were calculated at 4 weeks after RT. A comparison of patients with pain flare vs those without was performed. The relationships between the occurrence of pain flare and collected demographic variables were investigated. Result(s): From June 2010 to December 2013, 160 patients were enrolled in this study. From this cohort, 94 patients with complete data were evaluable for pain flare. There were 61 (65%) men and 33 (35%) women. Median age was 66 years. The majority of patients had primary breast (12%), lung (31%), or prostate (22%) carcinoma and were treated with 8 Gy in a single fraction (28%) or 20 Gy in five fractions (65%). The overall pain flare incidence across all centers was 42/94 (44.7%). The majority of pain flares occurred on Days 1-5 (88%) as opposed to Days 6-10 (12%). The median duration of the pain flare was 2 days. There was no significant difference between patients who experienced a pain flare vs those who did not in terms of sex, age, primary cancer site, radiation dose, previous systemic therapy, location or area of RT, or on any of the BPI items (p > 0.05). BPI scores showed a significant improvement at 4 weeks on all functional interference items (p < 0.05). The main differences were seen in the ""worst pain"" and ""sleep"" domains, both decreased from 7/10 at baseline to 4/10 at the 4-week follow-up. Conclusion(s): Pain flare is a common event, occurring in nearly half of the patients that receive palliative RT for symptomatic bone metastases. Furthermore, RT for symptomatic bone metastases is a very effective palliative treatment, in terms of both pain control and functional interference.",Excluded

Methods A retrospective analysis of 41 patients who had received tumor-bed FSRS (5 fractions) or SRT (10 fractions) after resection of brain metastasis between 2005 and 2015 was performed. All resection cavities were treated with a frameless linear accelerator-based system. Patients who underwent subtotal resection, single-dose SRS to the resection cavity, or were treated with a fractionation schedule other than 5 or 10 fractions, were excluded. Results Twenty-six patients were treated with 5 fractions and 15 patients with 10 fractions. The median planning target volume was 19.78 cm3 (12.3-28 cm3) to the 5-fraction group and 29.79 cm3 (26.3-47.6 cm3) to the 10-fraction group (P = 0.020). The 1-year and 2-year local control rates for all patients were 89.4% and 77.1%, respectively, and 89.6% and 78.6% were free from distant intracranial progression, respectively. No difference was observed in local control or freedom from distant intracranial progression between the 5-fraction or 10-fraction groups. The median overall survival was 28.27 months (95% confidence interval, 19.42-37.12) for all patients. No patient developed necrosis at the resection cavity. Conclusions Fractionation offers the potential to exploit the different biological responses between neoplastic and normal tissues to ionizing radiation. The use of 5 daily doses of 5-6 Gy or 10 daily doses of 3 Gy is a good strategy to have a reasonable local control and avoid neurotoxicity.Copyright © 2016 Elsevier Inc.",Excluded
1797,"Low-dose high-dose-rate brachytherapy in the treatment of facial lesions of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma Background: The use of many of the standard skin-directed mycosis fungoides (MF) therapies on facial skin may be limited by site-specific increased risks of side effects, excessive inflammation, and ocular toxicity. Objective(s): Our study aimed to describe the levels of erythema, scale, and induration of facial lesions in MF before and after low-dose high-dose-rate surface applicator brachytherapy and to examine the overall clinical response to brachytherapy. Method(s): A total of 23 facial MF lesions in 10 patients were treated with high-dose-rate brachytherapy doses of 4 Gy per session for a total of 2 fractions at our multidisciplinary cutaneous oncology clinic between August 17, 2009, and March 12, 2012. Result(s): In all 23 lesions, dramatic clinical improvement was observed. Patients were followed up for a median of 6.3 months. No recurrences were reported in the follow-up period. Limitation(s): Long-term follow-up is lacking. Reassessment of all included patients at annual intervals for a period of at least 5 years is the authors' goal. Conclusion(s): Low-dose high-dose-rate brachytherapy using custom-made surface molds is a highly efficacious therapy in the treatment of facial lesions in MF. © 2012 by the American Academy of Dermatology, Inc.",Excluded
3168,"[Hypothyroidism incidence after multimodal treatment for laryngeal cancer] BACKGROUND: Hypothyroidism following total laryngectomy or radiotherapy treatment for laryngeal cancer is not a rare event, especially in advanced stages. There are no reports on the incidence of hypothyroidism in patients who received chemotherapy and radiotherapy. The objective of this study is to determine the incidence of thyroid dysfunction in a group of patients with laryngeal cancer who underwent surgery as sole treatment, total laryngectomy or radiotherapy alone, and patients with combined treatment: surgery plus radiotherapy, concomitant chemoradiation therapy and chemoradiation therapy plus salvage surgery., METHODS: A prospective study of patients diagnosed with laryngeal cancer whose serum TSH and T4 levels were evaluated in a serial fashion., RESULTS: 70 patients with laryngeal cancer were studied; the average age at diagnosis was 70.2 years. Male patients were more affected, with a men-women ratio of 3.6:1. Glottic localization was the most frequent (44%). 64% of tumors were locally advanced carcinomas and 51% received multimodal treatment. 45 patients (63%) were diagnosed with hypothyroidism; 49% of the patients with subclinical hypothyroidism, and 51% with clinical hypothyroidism., CONCLUSIONS: Hypothyroidism is a complication following treatment for laryngeal cancer. It is recommended to evaluate the thyroid function periodically for timely detection.",Excluded

1866,"Phase I trial of concurrent hyperfractionated split course radiotherapy (HFx RT), cisplatin (cDDP), and paclitaxel in patients with recurrent, previously irradiated, or treatment-naive locally advanced upper aerodigestive malignancy Purpose: Phase I study to determine the maximally tolerated dose (MTD) of cisplatin (cDDP), paclitaxel (P), and concurrent split course hyperfractionated (BID) RT in advanced squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck (SCCHN) and other upper aerodigestive tumors. Material(s) and Method(s): Eligibility stipulated ECOG performance status 0-2 and either Tx-naive, locally advanced, or locally recurrent, previously radiated, surgically unresectable upper aerodigestive cancer. Metastases were permitted if disease was predominantly locoregional. RT-naive patients received 150 cGy bid x 5 d Q 2 wks x 4. Previously radiated patients received 150 cGy bid x 5, wk 1; then 120 cGy bid x 5 Q 2 wk x 3 (later increased to 150 cGy BID for the entire treatment). Treatment fields included recurrent tumor only with 2 cm margins. Whenever possible, conventional and 3-D conformal techniques were used. Elective nodal radiation was not administered. Starting doses of cDDP and P were 12 mg/m 2/d x 5 and 15 mg/m2/d x 5, respectively, Q 2 wk x 4, each given on RT days only. At dose level 2, cDDP was increased to 15 mg/m 2/d x 5. At dose level 3, P was increased to 20 mg/m2/d x 5. Granulocyte colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) days 6-12 (off treatment week) was added if cumulative neutropenia precipitated treatment delays. Result(s): Thirty-one patients (21 men, 10 women) were treated. Eight had received prior chemotherapy, 27 prior RT. At dose level three, regular treatment delays of >=1 week due to slow neutrophil recovery occurred. Addition of G-CSF (dose level 3b) reduced treatment delays from 100 percent to 28 percent and decreased the incidence of Grade >=2 neutropenia and mucositis. Six of 7 patients at this dose level completed all 4 cycles of treatment and all received full dose RT (60 Gy). No other dose-limiting toxicities occurred. Of 22 assessable patients with locally recurrent SCCHN, 12 (55 percent) responded. Median time to progression in this group was 6 months, with median and one-year survival of 9.5 mos and 41 percent, respectively. Conclusion(s): Concurrent daily cisplatin/paclitaxel and split course hyperfractionated RT (60 Gy) is feasible in previously radiated patients. G-CSF, administered between each cycle, reduces the incidence of treatment delays. Activity is promising and toxicity acceptable. Copyright © Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",Excluded
153,"Survival and complications following Gamma Knife radiosurgery or enucleation for ocular melanoma: A 20-year experience Background We present our experience in treating ocular melanoma at theNational Centre for Stereotactic Radiosurgery in Sheffield, UK over the last 20 years. Method We analysed 170 patients treated with Gamma Knife radiosurgery, recorded the evolution of visual acuity and complication rates, and compared their survival with 620 patients treated with eye enucleation. Different peripheral doses (using the 50% therapeutic isodose) were employed: 50-70 Gy for 24 patients, 45 Gy for 71 patients, 35 Gy for 62 patients. Findings There was no significant difference in survival between the 35-Gy, 45-Gy and 50- to 70-Gy groups when compared between themselves (p00.168) and with the enucleation group (p00.454). The 5-year survival rates were: 64% for 35 Gy, 62.71% for 45 Gy, 63.6% for 50-70 Gy and 65.2% for enucleated patients. Clinical variables influencing survival for radiosurgery patients were tumour volume (p00.014) and location (median 66.4 vs 37.36 months for juxtapapillary vs peripheral tumours, respectively; p00.001), while age and gender did not prove significant. Regarding complications, using 35 Gy led to more than a 50% decrease, when compared with the 45-Gy dose, in the incidence of cataract, glaucoma and retinal detachment. Retinopathy, optic neuropathy and vitreous haemorrhage were not significantly influenced. Blindness decreased dramatically from 83.7% for 45 Gy to 31.4% for 35 Gy (p00.006), as well as postradiosurgery enucleation: 23.9% for 45 Gy vs 6.45% for 35 Gy (p00.018). Visual acuity, recorded up to 5 years postradiosurgery, was significantly better preserved for 35 Gy than for 45 Gy (p00.0003). Conclusions Using 35 Gy led to a dramatic decrease in complications, vision loss and salvage enucleation, while not compromising patient survival. © Springer-Verlag 2012.",Excluded
3438,"Pathogen reduction by ultraviolet C light effectively inactivates human white blood cells in platelet products BACKGROUND: Residual white blood cells (WBCs) in cellular blood components induce a variety of adverse immune events, including nonhemolytic febrile transfusion reactions, alloimmunization to HLA antigens, and transfusion-associated graft-versus-host disease (TA-GVHD). Pathogen reduction (PR) methods such as the ultraviolet C (UVC) light-based THERAFLEX UV-Platelets system were developed to reduce the risk of transfusion-transmitted infection. As UVC light targets nucleic acids, it interferes with the replication of both pathogens and WBCs. This preclinical study aimed to evaluate the ability of UVC light to inactivate contaminating WBCs in platelet concentrates (PCs)., STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: The in vitro and in vivo function of WBCs from UVC-treated PCs was compared to that of WBCs from gamma-irradiated and untreated PCs by measuring cell viability, proliferation, cytokine secretion, antigen presentation in vitro, and xenogeneic GVHD responses in a humanized mouse model., RESULTS: UVC light was at least as effective as gamma irradiation in preventing GVHD in the mouse model. It was more effective in suppressing T-cell proliferation (>5-log reduction in the limiting dilution assay), cytokine secretion, and antigen presentation than gamma irradiation., CONCLUSIONS: The THERAFLEX UV-Platelets (MacoPharma) PR system can substitute gamma irradiation for TA-GVHD prophylaxis in platelet (PLT) transfusion. Moreover, UVC treatment achieves suppression of antigen presentation and inhibition of cytokine accumulation during storage of PCs, which has potential benefits for transfusion recipients.

3021,"Influence of preoperative femoral orientation on radiographic measures of femoral head height in total hip replacement Background: In total hip arthroplasty the surgeon aims to restore the biomechanics of the joint. Femoral height has the greatest influence on restoring limb length and contributes equally to the restoration of femoral head centre. On X-ray, the level of femoral neck resection is most often referenced off the upper border of lesser trochanter. Less frequently, femoral head centre is referenced from the tip of the greater trochanter. The error in measurement of femoral height resulting from unknown femoral rotation is crucially important and can result in inappropriate surgical planning for implant selection and placement. It is unknown which reference produces lower error. Method(s): A sample of femoral shapes was generated using a femoral statistical shape model. These were placed in a range of orientations in terms of external rotation and flexion, at intervals of 10degree. Simulated X-rays were then produced and the distances from the tip of either greater or lesser trochanter to femoral head centre were measured. Finding(s): Although using greater trochanter as a reference demonstrated greater errors at the extremes, both techniques resulted in errors of 7-8 mm with 20degree of both femoral external rotation and flexion. Interpretation(s): Moderate degrees of femoral external rotation combined with flexion can result in unsatisfactory errors when templating limb length. There should be greater focus and an agreed definition for femoral height. There is a clinical need for a method with a lower error in determining true femoral height and the level of neck resection.Copyright © 2020 Elsevier Ltd",Excluded

Patients received conventional concurrent platinum-based chemoradiotherapy without surgery; postradiotherapy consolidation chemotherapy was allowed. Post-treatment FDG-PET was performed at approximately 14 weeks after radiotherapy. SUVs were analyzed both as peak SUV (SUVpeak) and maximum SUV (SUVmax; both institutional and central review readings), with institutional SUVpeak as the primary end point. Relationships between the continuous and categorical (cutoff) SUVs and survival were analyzed using Cox proportional hazards multivariate models. Of 250 enrolled patients (226 were evaluable for pretreatment SUV), 173 patients were evaluable for post-treatment SUV analyses. The 2-year survival rate for the entire population was 42.5%. Pretreatment SUVpeak and SUVmax (mean, 10.3 and 13.1, respectively) were not associated with survival. Mean post-treatment SUVpeak and SUVmax were 3.2 and 4.0, respectively. Post-treatment SUVpeak was associated with survival in a continuous variable model (hazard ratio, 1.087; 95% CI, 1.014 to 1.166; P = .020). When analyzed as a prespecified binary value (<= v > 3.5), there was no association with survival. However, in exploratory analyses, significant results for survival were found using an SUVpeak cutoff of 5.0 (P = .041) or 7.0 (P < .001). All results were similar when SUVmax was used in univariate and multivariate models in place of SUVpeak. Higher post-treatment tumor SUV (SUVpeak or SUVmax) is associated with worse survival in stage III NSCLC, although a clear cutoff value for routine clinical use as a prognostic factor is uncertain at this time.",Excluded
720,"Is lateral opening of the cup related to pelvic tilt on the surgical table? Introduction: Surgical table and floor are the usual references for positioning the cup. This is correct if pelvis is perpendicular to them (tilt 0degree). But if shoulder girdle is wider than pelvic girdle, pelvis will be tilted towards the feet. And if shoulder girdle is narrower than pelvic girdle, pelvis will be tilted towards the head. Objective(s): To analyse pelvic tilt on surgical table ant its influence on lateral opening of the cup. Method(s): Prospective, blind, observational study. Fifty THA patients (26 female), 1 department, multiple surgeons. Lateral decubitus, horizontal surgical table, conventional anterior (pubic) and posterior (lumbar spine) supports. Preoperative measures: (with custom-made measuring device) width of shoulder and pelvic girdles, pelvic tilt (angle between horizontal surgical table and a line by both antero-superior iliac spines), pelvic tilt towards head or feet. Postero-lateral approach. Theoretical position of cup intended by surgeons: 45degree valgus. Post-surgical x-ray: measure of lateral opening of cup. Result(s): 21/50 (4 males): pelvic girdle 27 mm wider than shoulder girdle (female phenotype), pelvic tilt 1 +/- 7degree towards head, theoretical risk of horizontal cup. Radiographic lateral opening of the cup: 43 +/- 10degree. 3/50 (2 males): pelvic girdle width similar to shoulder girdle, pelvic tilt 7 +/- 2degree towards feet, theoretical risk of vertical cup. Radiographic valgus of cup: 43.8degree. 26/50 (18 males): shoulder girdle 23 mm wider than pelvis (male phenotype), pelvic tilt 1 +/- 5degree towards feet, theoretical risk of vertical cup. Radiographic valgus of cup: 45 +/- 9degree. No result is statistically significant. Conclusion(s): 1) Different widths of shoulder and pelvic girdles could theoretically influence pelvic tilt of patients in lateral decubitus on surgical table. 2) But actually most patients present a minor pelvic tilt. 3) The average radiographic valgus of cups is near 45degree, but the standard deviation is great and an important number is out of recommended range.",Excluded
1626,"Prognostic significance of serum carcinoembryonic antigen normalization on survival in rectal cancer treated with preoperative chemoradiation Purpose: The purpose of this retrospective study was to identify factors predictive of survival in rectal cancer patients who received surgery with curative intent after preoperative chemoradiotherapy (CRT). Material(s) and Method(s): Between July 1996 and June 2010, 104 patients underwent surgery for rectal cancer after preoperative CRT. The median dose of radiotherapy was 50.4 Gy (range, 43.2 to 54.4 Gy) for 6 weeks. Chemotherapy was a bolus injection of 5-fluorouracil and leucovorin for the first and last week of radiotherapy (n=84, 77.1%) or capecitabine administered daily during radiotherapy (n=17, 16.3%). Low anterior resection (n=86, 82.7%) or abdominoperineal resection (n=18, 17.3%) was performed at a median 47 days from the end of radiotherapy, and four cycles of adjuvant chemotherapy was administered. The serum carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) level was checked at initial diagnosis and just before surgery. Result(s): After a median follow-up of 48 months (range, 9 to 174 months), 5-year disease free survival (DFS) was 74.5% and 5-year overall survival (OS) was 86.4%. Down staging of T diagnoses occurred in 32 patients (30.8%) and of N diagnoses in 40 patients (38.5%). The CEA change from initial diagnosis to pre-surgery (high-high vs. highnormal vs. normal-normal) was a statistically significant prognostic factor for DFS (p=0.012), OS (p=0.002), and distant metastasis free survival (p=0.018) in a multivariate analysis. Conclusion(s): Patients who achieve normal CEA level by the time of surgery have a more favorable outcome than those who retain a high CEA level after preoperative CRT. The normalization of CEA levels can provide important information about the prognosis in rectal cancer treatment. © 2013 by the Korean Cancer Association.",Excluded
1373,"Gamma-radiation sensitivity and risk of glioma BACKGROUND: About 9% of human cancers are brain tumors, of which 90% are gliomas. gamma-Radiation has been identified as a risk factor for brain tumors. In a previous pilot study, we found that lymphocytes from patients with glioma were more sensitive to gamma-radiation than were lymphocytes from matched control subjects. In this larger case-control study, we compared the gamma-radiation sensitivity of lymphocytes from glioma patients with those from control subjects and investigated the association between mutagen sensitivity and the risk for developing glioma., METHODS: We used a mutagen sensitivity assay (an indirect measure of DNA repair activity) to assess chromosomal damage. We gamma-irradiated (1.5 Gy) short-term lymphocyte cultures from 219 case patients with glioma and from 238 healthy control subjects frequency matched by age and sex. After irradiation, cells were cultured for 4 hours, and then Colcemid was added for 1 hour to arrest cells in mitosis. Fifty metaphases were randomly selected for each sample and scored for chromatid breaks. All statistical tests were two-sided., RESULTS: We observed a statistically significantly higher frequency of chromatid breaks per cell from case patients with glioma (mean = 0.55; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.50 to 0.59) than from control subjects (mean = 0.44; 95% CI = 0.41 to 0.48) (P<.001). Using 0.40 (the median number of chromatid breaks per cell in control subjects) as the cut point for defining mutagen sensitivity and adjusting for age, sex, and smoking status, we found that mutagen sensitivity was statistically significantly associated with an increased risk for glioma (odds ratio = 2.09; 95% CI = 1.43 to 3.06). When the data were divided into tertiles, the relative risk for glioma increased from the lowest tertile to the highest tertile (trend test, P<.001)., CONCLUSION: gamma-Radiation-induced mutagen sensitivity of lymphocytes may be associated with an increased risk for glioma, a result that supports our earlier preliminary findings.",Included

We then tested such system on bedside CXRs of an independent group of 110 patients (74 COVID-19, 36 non-COVID-19) from one of the two hospitals. A retrospective reading was performed by two radiologists in the absence of any clinical information, with the aim to differentiate COVID-19 from non-COVID-19 patients. Real-time polymerase chain reaction served as the reference standard., RESULTS: At 10-fold cross-validation, our deep learning model classified COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 patients with 0.78 sensitivity (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.74-0.81), 0.82 specificity (95% CI 0.78-0.85), and 0.89 area under the curve (AUC) (95% CI 0.86-0.91). For the independent dataset, deep learning showed 0.80 sensitivity (95% CI 0.72-0.86) (59/74), 0.81 specificity (29/36) (95% CI 0.73-0.87), and 0.81 AUC (95% CI 0.73-0.87).

1299,"Treatment and prognosis of stage I follicular lymphoma in the modern era-does PET matter? Follicular lymphoma (FL) is the most common subtype of indolent non-Hodgkin lymphoma. Patients with stage I disease are usually treated with radiotherapy (RT). In previous studies, mostly from the pre positron emission tomography-computed tomography (PET-CT) era, the 5 year progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) rates of stage I disease were 60-80% and 80-93%, respectively. This study retrospectively evaluated the outcome of stage I FL which was treated with involved field RT in the PET-CT era between 2002 and 2015. Ninety-one patients were enrolled. Five year PFS and OS rates were 73% and 97%, respectively. Relapse occurred in 19 (21%) patients, 74% occurring outside the radiation field. In conclusion, PET-CT staging of clinical stage I FL may contribute to the improved prognosis in patients treated with RT compared to historical cohorts, possibly due to better identification of ""genuine"" stage I disease.Copyright © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",Excluded
254,"Long-term outcomes of fractionated stereotactic radiation therapy for pituitary adenomas at the BC cancer agency Purpose To assess the long-term disease control and toxicity outcomes of fractionated stereotactic radiation therapy (FSRT) in patients with pituitary adenomas treated at the BC Cancer Agency. Methods and Materials To ensure a minimum of 5 years of clinical follow-up, this study identified a cohort of 76 patients treated consecutively with FSRT between 1998 and 2007 for pituitary adenomas: 71% (54/76) had nonfunctioning and 29% (22/76) had functioning adenomas (15 adrenocorticotrophic hormone-secreting, 5 growth hormone-secreting, and 2 prolactin-secreting). Surgery was used before FSRT in 96% (73/76) of patients. A median isocenter dose of 50.4 Gy was delivered in 28 fractions, with 100% of the planning target volume covered by the 90% isodose. Patients were followed up clinically by endocrinologists, ophthalmologists, and radiation oncologists. Serial magnetic resonance imaging was used to assess tumor response. Results With a median follow-up time of 6.8 years (range, 0.6 - 13.1 years), the 7-year progression-free survival was 97.1% and disease-specific survival was 100%. Of the 2 patients with tumor progression, both had disease control after salvage surgery. Of the 22 patients with functioning adenomas, 50% (11/22) had complete and 9% (2/22) had partial responses after FSRT. Of the patients with normal pituitary function at baseline, 48% (14/29) experienced 1 or more hormone deficiencies after FSRT. Although 79% (60/76) of optic chiasms were at least partially within the planning target volumes, no patient experienced radiation-induced optic neuropathy. No patient experienced radionecrosis. No secondary malignancy occurred during follow-up.

649,"Pre-apoptotic response to therapeutic DNA damage involves protein modulation of Mcl-1, Hdm2 and Flt3 in acute myeloid leukemia cells Background: Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cells are characterized by non-mutated TP53, high levels of Hdm2, and frequent mutation of the Flt3 receptor tyrosine kinase. The juxtamembrane mutation of FLT3 is the strongest independent marker for disease relapse and is associated with elevated Bcl-2 protein and p53 hyper-phosphorylation in AML. DNA damage forms the basic mechanism of cancer cell eradication in current therapy of AML. Hdm2 and pro-apoptotic Bcl-2 members are among the most intensely induced genes immediately after chemotherapy and Hdm2 is proposed a role in receptor tyrosine kinase regulation. Thus we examined the DNA damage related modulation of these proteins in relation to FLT3 mutational status and induction of apoptosis. Result(s): Within one hour after exposure to ionizing radiation (IR), the AML cells (NB4, MV4-11, HL-60, primary AML cells) showed an increase in Flt3 protein independent of mRNA levels, while the Hdm2 protein decreased. The FLT3 mutant MV4-11 cells were resistant to IR accompanied by presence of both Mcl-1 and Hdm2 protein three hours after IR. In contrast, the FLT3 wild type NB4 cells responded to IR with apoptosis and pre-apoptotic Mcl-1 down regulation. Daunorubicin (DNR) induced continuing down regulation of Hdm2 and Mcl-1 in both cell lines followed by apoptosis. Conclusion(s): Both IR and DNR treatment resulted in concerted protein modulations of Mcl-1, Hdm2 and Flt3. Cell death induction was associated with persistent attenuation of Mcl-1 and Hdm2. These observations suggest that defining the pathway(s) modulating Flt3, Hdm2 and Mcl-1 may propose new strategies to optimize therapy for the relapse prone FLT3 mutated AML patients. © 2007 Wergeland et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",Included

3591,"Use of a hybrid iterative reconstruction technique to reduce image noise and improve image quality in obese patients undergoing computed tomographic pulmonary angiography Purpose: To determine whether an iterative reconstruction (IR) technique (iDose, Philips Healthcare) can reduce image noise and improve image quality in obese patients undergoing computed tomographic pulmonary angiography (CTPA). Material(s) and Method(s): The study was Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act compliant and approved by our institutional review board. A total of 33 obese patients (average body mass index: 42.7) underwent CTPA studies following standard departmental protocols. The data were reconstructed with filtered back projection (FBP) and 3 iDose strengths (iDoseL1, iDoseL3, and iDoseL5) for a total of 132 studies. FBP data were collected from 33 controls (average body mass index: 22) undergoing CTPA. Regions of interest were drawn at 6 identical levels in the pulmonary artery (PA), from the main PA to a subsegmental branch, in both the control group and study groups using each algorithm. Noise and attenuation were measured at all PA levels. Three thoracic radiologists graded each study on a scale of 1 (very poor) to 5 (ideal) by 4 categories: image quality, noise, PA enhancement, and ""plastic"" appearance. Statistical analysis was performed using an unpaired t test, 1-way analysis of variance, and linear weighted kappa. Result(s): Compared with the control group, there was significantly higher noise with FBP, iDoseL1, and iDoseL3 algorithms (P<0.001) in the study group. There was no significant difference between the noise in the control group and iDoseL5 algorithm in the study group. Analysis within the study group showed a significant and progressive decrease in noise and increase in the contrast-to-noise ratio as the level of IR was increased (P<0.001). Compared with FBP, readers graded overall image quality as being higher using iDoseL1 (P=0.0018), iDoseL3 (P<0.001), and iDoseL5 (P<0.001). Compared with FBP, there was subjective improvement in image noise and PA enhancement with increasing levels of iDose. Conclusion(s): The use of an IR technique leads to qualitative and quantitative improvements in image noise and image quality in obese patients undergoing CTPA. © 2013 by Lippincott Williams & Wilkins.",Excluded

Overall, 3D conformal treatment planning resulted in more homogenous dose distribution to target tissues with lower hot spots and dose ranges. Dose homogeneity and guarantee of not under-dosing target tissues with 3D conformal planning came at the cost, however, of delivering greater mean doses of radiation and of irradiating greater volumes of surrounding normal tissue structures.

We have shown that in solar keratoses (SK) and in paralesional skin there is instead of an even distribution of succinic dehydrogenase (SDH) activity a relative decreased activity in the granular cell layer. Furthermore, there is enhancement of the usual concentration of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PDH) activity in the granular zone as well as an increase in total G6PDH epidermal activity. In the experimental part of this study, six normal volunteer subjects had areas of normally non exposed skin (buttocks) irradiated with a 2 Mean erythema dose of ultra violet light (290--400 nm) on between 3 and 5 occasions per week for 2--6 week periods.

312,"Characteristics of photopheresis treatments for the management of rejection in heart and lung transplant recipients Photopheresis has been used in the management of rejection of heart and/or lung transplants. Although its mechanism of action remains unknown, irradiated T-helper cell-induced immunosuppression is the main theory. Since transplant recipients are often lymphopenic and lymphocytes are the target cells in photo-therapy, we performed this study to determine which factors affect the cellular yield to undergo irradiation. We reviewed the records of all photophereses performed in our institution between July 1998 and April 2000 using the UVAR (first generation) or XTS (second generation) instruments (Therakos, Exton, PA). Our data included patient's blood volume, absolute lymphocyte count and hematocrit, catheter type, flow rate of collection cycles and centrifuge bowl size, as well as volume, hematocrit, and lymphocyte count of the cell suspension. With a mixed model multivariate analysis we sought to determine which variables predicted the lymphocyte yield. A total of 406 procedures in 25 adult patients was analyzed. There was no significant difference between the lymphocyte yield among the procedures performed with the first- and the second-generation instruments. The patient's absolute lymphocyte count was the only parameter, which positively correlated with the total number of lymphocytes collected for irradiation (P < 0.0001). Indeed, based on the mixed model, the total number of lymphocytes for irradiation can be predicted from the pre-procedure lymphocyte count. Additional studies are necessary to correlate the number of treated cells with patient outcome. © 2002 Wiley-Liss, Inc.",Excluded
3396,"Osteoporotic fractures in rheumatoid arthritis patients in Argentina: a matched retrospective cohort study Background: To compare the incidence of osteoporotic fractures in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) with matched controls from a university hospital. Method(s): Consecutive RA patients (n = 100) were matched (age and sex) with controls (1:2). The follow-up period began at the index date, defined as the date of diagnosis for RA patients and the date of the first medical claim at the Health Management Organization (HMO) for non-RA patients. Fracture incidence rates per 1000 persons-years (PY) for distinct types of fractures were calculated. Multivariate cox regression analysis was performed to identify factors associated with fractures. Result(s): One hundred RA patients were followed for a total of 975.1 patients-years and 200 controls for 1485.7 patients-years. No difference was found in the overall fracture incidence rate per 1000 PY between RA and controls (19.5, 95% CI 12.7-28.6 vs 12.1, 95% CI 7.7-18.7, p = 0.07). In the Cox regression analysis, only age (HR 1.06, 95% CI 1.02-1.11, p = 0.006) and history of a prior fracture (HR 9.85, 95% CI 2.97-32.64, p < 0.001) were associated with fractures after the index date. The stratified analysis of the fractures by location showed that only the vertebral fractures were more frequent in RA patients compared with controls (12.9 per 1000 PY, 95% CI 8.9-25.8, vs. 3.4, 95% CI 1.4-8.1, respectively, p = 0.01). Conclusion(s): Patients with RA didn't show an overall increased risk of osteoporotic fractures compared with matched controls, but vertebral fractures were more frequently observed in patients with RA.Copyright © 2021, The Author(s).",Excluded
3471,"Fluoroscopic Sacroiliac Joint Injection: Is Oblique Angulation Really Necessary? BACKGROUND: The conventional technique for sacroiliac (SI) joint injection involves aligning the anterior and posterior aspects of the SI joint under fluoroscopic guidance and then entering the SI joint in the most caudal aspect., OBJECTIVE: We wish to highlight that there is no added advantage to aligning both the anterior and posterior joint lines of the SI joint as it is time consuming, associated with additional radiation exposure, and may make the entry into the posterior SI joint technically more difficult., STUDY DESIGN: Observational study., SETTING: Pain Clinic, Department of Anesthesiology., METHODS: With the patient lying prone on fluoroscopy table, SI joint injection is performed with a 22 G, 10 cm spinal needle in a true anteroposterior (AP) view, where anterior and posterior SI joint spaces are seen as separate entities, where the medial joint space represents the posterior SI joint and the lateral joint space represents the anterior SI joint. The distal 1 cm of the medial joint space is entered under AP view. If the SI joint is seen as a straight line rather than 2 joint spaces in the AP view then the image intensifier of the fluoroscope was tilted cranially to elongate the image of the lower part of the posterior SI joint, thus facilitating entry into this part of the joint which was confirmed by administering 0.3 to 0.5 mL of radiopaque contrast medium., RESULT: Sixty SI joints of 58 patients were injected under an AP fluoroscopic view. Forty-two (70%) SI joints were seen as 2 separate medial and lateral joint spaces and were entered in distal 1 cm of the medial joint space. In 18 (30%) joints seen as a straight line rather than 2 separate spaces, the image intensifier of the fluoroscope was tilted cranially to elongate the image of the lower part of the posterior SI joint and then the SI joint was entered in its distal 1 cm. Confirmation of entry into the SI joint was confirmed by with 0.3 to 0.5 mL of radiopaque contrast medium. In 4 cases the joints did not show the correct radiopaque contrast spread (3/42 and 1/18) although the needle seemed to be in the joint space., LIMITATIONS: Small sample size., CONCLUSION: Aligning the anterior and posterior aspects of SI joint for fluoroscopic guided SI joint injection is not necessary for the success of the block.Key words: Sacroiliac joint, injection, anteroposterior view, oblique angulation, fluoroscopic technique.",Excluded

821,"Sex- and APOE isoform-dependent effects of radiation on cognitive function Clinical irradiation of the brain induces hippocampus-dependent cognitive impairments in some but not all individuals, suggesting the involvement of genetic risk factors. Deficiency of apolipoprotein E (APOE), which is important for the metabolism and redistribution of lipoproteins and cholesterol, increases behavioral impairments after irradiation, supporting a protective role for APOE against radiation-induced cognitive injury. Compared to APOE3, APOE4 increases while APOE2 decreases the risk of developing age-related cognitive decline and Alzheimer's disease, particularly in women. To determine the potential effects of APOE isoform and sex on radiation-induced cognitive impairments, we irradiated 2-month-old male and female APOE2, APOE3 and APOE4 mice and assessed their cognitive performance 3 months later. When hippocampus-dependent spatial learning and memory were assessed in the water maze, sham-irradiated female APOE2, APOE3 and APOE4 and irradiated female APOE2 mice showed spatial memory retention, but irradiated female APOE3 and APOE4 mice did not. Compared to sham-irradiated female APOE4 mice, irradiated female APOE4 mice also required more trials to reach criterion in the hippocampus-dependent passive avoidance test. Radiation had no effects on water maze or passive avoidance learning and memory of male APOE2, APOE3 or APOE4 mice, indicating that the effects of radiation on cognitive performance are dependent on sex- and APOE isoform.",Included
3603,"Intra-arterial versus intravenous chemoradiation for advanced head and neck cancer: Results of a randomized phase 3 trial BACKGROUND: Chemoradiation is the preferred treatment for advanced stage IV head and neck cancer. Higher doses of chemotherapy yielded promising results in vitro and vivo, confirmed by intra-arterial (IA) cisplatin-based chemoradiation in phase 2 studies. METHOD(S): Two hundred and thirty-nine patients with (functionally) unresectable head and neck cancer were included, from 2000 to 2004, in a multicenter, randomized phase 3 trial, comparing IA and intravenous chemoradiation. Intravenous chemoradiation comprised 3x100 mg/m 2 cisplatin infusion on Days 1, 22, 43 combined with 70 Gy in 35 daily fractions. The IA chemoradiation treatment arm comprised 4x150 mg/m2 cisplatin administered in the tumor-feeding artery on Days 1, 8, 15, 22, immediately followed by systemic rescue with sodium thiosulfate with the same radiotherapeutic regimen. RESULT(S): Two patients were excluded from analysis because of nontreatment-related death immediately after randomization (n=1) and esophageal carcinoma (n=1). The median follow-up was 33 months 1-104 months. Ninety percent of the patients required tube feeding during treatment. Renal toxicity >grade 2 was 9% in the intravenous compared with 1% in the IA treatment arm (P <= .0001). There was no difference in locoregional control, disease-free survival (DFS) or overall survival (OS), between the treatment arms. At 3 years, local control, locoregional control, DFS, and OS was .76, .63, .44, .51 in the IA versus .70, .65, .47, .47 in the intravenous treatment arm, respectively. CONCLUSION(S): Cisplatin-based IA chemoradiation was not superior to intravenous chemoradiation for advanced stage IV head and neck cancer regarding locoregional control and survival. © 2010 American Cancer Society.",Excluded

Previous ground-based research has indicated around a 50% occurrence of both venous gas emboli (VGE) and symptoms of decompression illness (DCI) after similar decompressions. In contrast, no DCI symptoms have been reported from past or current space activities. Twenty subjects were studied using Doppler ultrasound to detect any VGE during decompression to 386hPa, where they remained for up to 6h. Subjects were supine to simulate weightlessness. A large number of VGE were found in one subject at rest, who had a recent arm fracture; a small number of VGE were found in another subject during provocation with calf contractions. No changes in exhaled nitric oxide were found that can be related to either simulated EVA or actual EVA (studied in a parallel study on four cosmonauts). We conclude that weightlessness appears to be protective against DCI and that exhaled NO is not likely to be useful to monitor VGE.",Excluded
1434,"Use of handheld X-ray fluorescence as a non-invasive method to distinguish between Asian and African elephant tusks We describe the use of handheld X-ray fluorescence, for elephant tusk species identification. Asian (n=72) and African (n=85) elephant tusks were scanned and we utilized the species differences in elemental composition to develop a functional model differentiating between species with high precision. Spatially, the majority of measured elements (n=26) exhibited a homogeneous distribution in cross-section, but a more heterologous pattern in the longitudinal direction. Twenty-one of twenty four elements differed between Asian and African samples. Data were subjected to hierarchical cluster analysis followed by a stepwise discriminant analysis, which identified elements for the functional equation. The best equation consisted of ratios of Si, S, Cl, Ti, Mn, Ag, Sb and W, with Zr as the denominator. Next, Bayesian binary regression model analysis was conducted to predict the probability that a tusk would be of African origin. A cut-off value was established to improve discrimination. This Bayesian hybrid classification model was then validated by scanning an additional 30 Asian and 41 African tusks, which showed high accuracy (94%) and precision (95%) rates. We conclude that handheld XRF is an accurate, non-invasive method to discriminate origin of elephant tusks provides rapid results applicable to use in the field.",Excluded
1056,"Hypofractionated radiotherapy as definitive treatment of stage i non-small cell lung cancer in older patients Purpose/Objective(S):: We report our experience using hypofractionated radiotherapy in older patients. MATERIALS/Methods: This analysis includes patients aged 60 years and older at our institution with inoperable Stage I (T1/T2 N0 M0) non-small-cell lung cancer that completed a curative course of radiotherapy alone using a hypofractionated schedule. Between 1991 and 2006, 75 such patients were identified with median age of 74 years (range, 60-86). Patient characteristics were as follows: male, 65/75 (86.7%); stage IA (T1N0), 47/75 (62.7%); stage IB (T2N0), 28/75 (37.3%). Patients received a median total dose of 6500 cGy using median daily dose fractions of 250 cGy. The following outcomes were analyzed: local failure free survival (time to local failure or death from any cause), time to distal failure as first event, and overall survival. Toxicities were evaluated using Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events v 3.0. Result(s): The median follow-up was 19.6 months (range: 4.0-128.8 months). Median local failure free survival was 19.6 months (95% confidence interval [CI]: 14.4-28.8 months); and median overall survival was 21.2 months (95% CI: 14.9-29.3 months). Analysis of competing risks showed that at 5 years, the probability of local failure as the first detected event was 22.1% (95% CI: 12.8%-32.9%); the probability of distal failure as the first detected event was 14.5% (95% CI: 7.3%-24.0%); and the probability of death without recording a failure was 48.6% (95% CI: 36.1%-60.1%). Radiation-related toxicity of grade 3 or greater was seen in 3 patients and there were no treatment-related deaths.

We investigated physicians' perception on effectiveness of lung cancer screening depending on screening modality, selection criteria for subjects of screening, types of equipment used to screen, and perception for seriousness of adverse effects following the test. In addition, odds ratios to underestimate risk of radiation exposure from screening were calculated through logistic regression analysis., RESULTS: Each response that chest X-ray is effective for lung cancer screening and that smoking history is not considered prior to screening recommendation accounted for more than 60% of respondents, suggesting the chance of unnecessary screening tests. Regarding adverse effects of lung cancer screening, about 85% of respondents replied that false positive, radiation exposure, and overdiagnosis could be ignored. About 70% of respondents underestimated radiation dose from lung cancer screening, and a low proportion of physicians informed patients of radiation exposure risk., CONCLUSIONS: It was found that most physicians underestimated harms of lung cancer screening including radiation exposure and were lack of awareness regarding lung cancer screening. It should be noted that physicians need to have proper perceptions about screening recommendation and accompanying possible harms, for successful implementation of the screening program.",Excluded
2832,"Hippocampal sparing radiotherapy for glioblastoma patients: A planning study using volumetric modulated arc therapy Background: The purpose of this study is to investigate the potential to reduce exposure of the contralateral hippocampus in radiotherapy for glioblastoma using volumetric modulated arc therapy (VMAT). Method(s): Datasets of 27 patients who had received 3D conformal radiotherapy (3D-CRT) for glioblastoma with a prescribed dose of 60Gy in fractions of 2Gy were included in this planning study. VMAT plans were optimized with the aim to reduce the dose to the contralateral hippocampus as much as possible without compromising other parameters. Hippocampal dose and treatment parameters were compared to the 3D-CRT plans using the Wilcoxon signed-rank test. The influence of tumour location and PTV size on the hippocampal dose was investigated with the Mann-Whitney-U-test and Spearman's rank correlation coefficient. Result(s): The median reduction of the contralateral hippocampus generalized equivalent uniform dose (gEUD) with VMAT was 36 % compared to the original 3D-CRT plans (p<0.05). Other dose parameters were maintained or improved. The median V30Gy brain could be reduced by 17.9 % (p<0.05). For VMAT, a parietal and a non-temporal tumour localisation as well as a larger PTV size were predictors for a higher hippocampal dose (p<0.05). Conclusion(s): Using VMAT, a substantial reduction of the radiotherapy dose to the contralateral hippocampus for patients with glioblastoma is feasible without compromising other treatment parameters. For larger PTV sizes, less sparing can be achieved. Whether this approach is able to preserve the neurocognitive status without compromising the oncological outcome needs to be investigated in the setting of prospective clinical trials.Copyright © 2016 The Author(s).",Excluded

3573,"Evaluating the radioprotective effect of Cimetidine, IMOD, and hybrid radioprotectors agents: An in-vitro study Introduction: There are various radioprotective agents with different mechanisms that help to decrease ionizing radiation side effects. The radioprotective effect of Cimetidine and IMOD was assessed individually and compared with the hybrid radioprotectors agents (HRPAs-IMOD and Cimetidine) on human lymphocyte cells. Method(s): Twenty healthy volunteers (ten men and ten women) participated in the present study. About 75 mL peripheral blood lymphocytes from each individual were collected, and they were divided into 36 groups. Briefly, the blood samples were treated with different concentrations of Cimetidine (12.6 and 25.2 mug/mL) and IMOD (0.04, 0.08, and 0.12 mg/mL), and also a combination of these agents, namely hybrid radioprotectors agents (HRPAs). Besides, the irradiated groups were exposed to 2 and 4 Gy of Co-60 gamma irradiation. The amount of cellular damage was assessed using the micronucleus assay. The repeated measurements and paired T-test statistical analysis were used to compare the micronucleus frequencies in different groups. Result(s): The micronucleus frequencies were significantly reduced (p < 0.05) in irradiated groups when the non-toxic concentrations of Cimetidine, IMOD, and HRPAs have been used. The reduction in micronucleus frequency was obtained 5-29% for Cimetidine and 40-51% for IMOD in peripheral blood lymphocytes irradiated with 2 Gy. This reduction in 4 Gy irradiation was 8-17% for Cimetidine and 27-37% for IMOD. The HRPAs resulted in a higher radioprotective effect, in a way that they cause up to 58% and 43% micronucleus frequency reduction in 2 and 4 Gy, respectively. Conclusion(s): In conclusion, the HRPAs showed the highest level of radioprotective. In addition, IMOD was remarkably higher radioprotective than Cimetidine, which may be related to its greater non-toxic concentrations.Copyright © 2021 Elsevier Ltd",Excluded

3201,"Investigating the SPECT Dose-Function Metrics Associated With Radiation-Induced Lung Toxicity Risk in Patients With Non-small Cell Lung Cancer Undergoing Radiation Therapy Purpose: Dose to normal lung has commonly been linked with radiation-induced lung toxicity (RILT) risk, but incorporating functional lung metrics in treatment planning may help further optimize dose delivery and reduce RILT incidence. The purpose of this study was to investigate the impact of the dose delivered to functional lung regions by analyzing perfusion (Q), ventilation (V), and combined V/Q single-photon-emission computed tomography (SPECT) dose-function metrics with regard to RILT risk in patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients who received radiation therapy (RT). Methods and Materials: SPECT images acquired from 88 patients with locally advanced NSCLC before undergoing conventionally fractionated RT were retrospectively analyzed. Dose was converted to the nominal dose equivalent per 2 Gy fraction, and SPECT intensities were normalized. Regional lung segments were defined, and the average dose delivered to each lung region was quantified. Three functional categorizations were defined to represent low-, normal-, and high-functioning lungs. The percent of functional lung category receiving >=20 Gy and mean functional intensity receiving >=20 Gy (iV20) were calculated. RILT was defined as grade 2+ radiation pneumonitis and/or clinical radiation fibrosis. A logistic regression was used to evaluate the association between dose-function metrics and risk of RILT. Result(s): By analyzing V/Q normalized intensities and functional distributions across the population, a wide range in functional capability (especially in the ipsilateral lung) was observed in patients with NSCLC before RT. Through multivariable regression models, global lung average dose to the lower lung was found to be significantly associated with RILT, and Q and V iV20 were correlated with RILT when using ipsilateral lung metrics. Through a receiver operating characteristic analysis, combined V/Q low-function receiving >=20 Gy (low-functioning V/Q20) in the ipsilateral lung was found to be the best predictor (area under the curce: 0.79) of RILT risk. Conclusion(s): Irradiation of the inferior lung appears to be a locational sensitivity for RILT risk. The multivariable correlation between ipsilateral lung iV20 and RILT, as well as the association of low-functioning V/Q20 and RILT, suggest that irradiating low-functioning regions in the lung may lead to higher toxicity rates.Copyright © 2021 The Authors",Excluded
981,"Reducing radiation exposure during invasive coronary angiography and percutaneous coronary interventions implementing a simple four-step protocol Background: With an increasing number of complex and repeated percutaneous coronary interventions (PCI), radiation-induced hazards for patients and operators remain an important issue in fluoroscopy-guided procedures. Our objective was to evaluate radiation exposure during coronary angiographic procedures and assess the efficacy of a four-step program to reduce radiation exposure during coronary angiography (CAG) and PCI. Methods and Results: A retrospective single-center analysis was performed in patients undergoing CAG or PCI in the first 6 months of 2012 vs. the first 6 months of 2014 (n = 3,107 procedures). During 2013, a four-step protocol was established in our hospital. It contained measures to reduce radiation exposure, including a frame rate reduction from 15 to 7.5 frames per second, the use of fluoroscopy storage, strict use of beam collimation, and repeat training on radiation safety. After adjustment for confounding variables, a dose-area product (DAP) reduction of 54.2 % was observed subsequent to implementation of the four-step protocol. Independent predictors of DAP were age [odds ratio (OR) 1.01], body surface area (OR 5.47), prior coronary artery bypass grafting (OR 1.44), radial access (OR 1.16), PCI (OR 2.36), female gender (OR 0.91), and the implementation of the four-step program (OR 0.46). Conclusion(s): A simple four-step protocol led to a significant reduction in radiation exposure in diagnostic and interventional coronary procedures without significant drawbacks in image quality. Hence, radiation safety programs are of paramount importance and should be established to improve patient and operator safety with regard to radiation-induced hazards.Copyright © 2015, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.",Excluded

Method(s): All NPC cases referred to the Peter MacCallum Centre for Metabolic Imaging between January 2002 and December 2007 were identified. In patients undergoing initial staging, any differences between the pre-PET/CT management plan based on CI and that following performance of the PET/CT scan were noted. Clinical impact was scored using the Centre's published criteria: 'high' if PET/CT changed the primary treatment modality or intent, 'medium' if treatment modality was unchanged but the radiotherapy technique or dose was altered, and 'low' if there was no change in treatment modality or intent. Patients undergoing PET/CT following definitive treatment were scored according to whether or not they achieved a complete metabolic response. Result(s): Forty-eight patients underwent a staging PET/CT. The clinical impact was high in 8%, medium in 25% and low in 66% of patients. Twenty-one patients were scanned for post-treatment response. PET/CT was less frequently equivocal than MRI (3 vs 8/21). A complete metabolic response on PET/CT was associated with a 93% negative predictive value for subsequent recurrence. Conclusion(s): PET/CT is a valuable staging tool for the detection of occult metastatic disease and defining the extent of neck nodal disease. Post-treatment, a complete metabolic response on PET/CT has a very high negative predictive value with fewer equivocal results than MRI. © 2011 The Royal Australian and New Zealand College of Radiologists.",Excluded
555,"Chest wall reconstruction after full thickness resection: an experience with 22 patients The authors present their experience of chest wall reconstruction after full thickness resection in 22 patients. The patients are from a series of 80 patients treated by chest wall resection from 1967 to 1989. Whether performed on breasts still in place, for recurrent disease, or for radiation-induced lesions (which are often associated), the defect created by complete resection of the chest wall layers causes difficulties. Large cutaneous flaps, often including the opposite breast were used at the beginning of the series. Then came omentum associated to Mersilene mesh and myocutaneous flaps. The results, in terms of comfort and local control are acceptable, even though surgery is only palliative for cancer patients. We feel that full thickness chest wall resection is the only effective treatment for some primary and recurrent malignant tumors and for extensive thoracic radionecroses. Such procedures are designed to improve the patient's quality of life even if they do not actually prolong survival. The goals guiding the reconstruction programme are: (1) the restoration of a stable parietal rigidity; and (2) the reconstruction of long lasting superficial layers.",Excluded

OBJECTIVE(S): To investigate the physical factors associated with self-efficacy in patients with chronic mechanic LBP. METHOD(S): One hundred nine patients diagnosed as chronic mechanic LBP (65 females, 44 males) between 20-50 years old were included to this study. The intensity of LBP was assessed by using a 10-cm Visual Analogue Scale. For musculoskeletal fitness measurement; muscle strength, muscle endurance, and flexibility tests were applied. Functional Reach Test for balance evaluation, Self-Efficacy Scale for self-efficacy measurement, Roland-Morris Disability Questionnaire for disability level evaluation were used. RESULT(S): We found a moderate negative correlation between self-efficacy and pain intensity (r=-0.506); a negative and strong correlation between self-efficacy and disability level (r=-0.654) (p< 0.05). Self efficacy had a significant association with right (r= 0.265) and left (r= 0.290) lateral side bending flexibility (p< 0.05). According to multiple regression analysis results, it was found that disability level had a significant effect on self-efficacy (beta=-2.014; p< 0.01). CONCLUSION(S): Poor musculoskeletal fitness and pain intensity may cause decreasing self-efficacy but the major determinant of decreased self-efficacy was low-back related disability scores.Copyright © 2018 - IOS Press and the authors.

The particle environments are taken from the orbit-averaged NASA AP8 and AE8 models at solar cycle maxima and minima. The transport of energetic particles through space suit materials and body tissue is calculated by using the NASA LaRC HZETRN code for hadrons and a recently developed deterministic transport code, ELTRN, for electrons. The doses within the CAM and CAF models are determined from energy deposition at given target points along 968 directional rays convergent on the points and are evaluated for several points on the skin and within the body. Dosimetric quantities include contributions from primary protons, light ions, and electrons, as well as from secondary brehmsstrahlung and target fragments.

Material(s) and Method(s): Thirty-eight patients with T1-4, N0-2, M0 NPC received conventional radiotherapy. Stimulated whole saliva was collected at baseline and 2, 6 and 12 months after radiotherapy. Salivary anions levels were measured using ion chromatography. Result(s): A reduction in stimulated saliva flow and salivary pH was accompanied by sustained changes in anionic composition. At 2 months following radiotherapy, there was a significant increase in chloride, sulphate, lactate and formate levels while significant reductions in nitrate and thiocyanate levels were found. No further changes in these anion levels were observed at 6 and 12 months. No significant changes were found in phosphate, acetate, or propionate levels throughout the study period. Conclusion(s): Conventional radiotherapy has a significant and prolonged impact on certain anionic species, likely contributing to increased cariogenic properties and reduced antimicrobial capacities of saliva in NPC patients post-radiotherapy.Copyright © 2016 Pow et al.

954,"Stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) for operable Stage i non-small-cell lung cancer: Can SBRT be comparable to surgery? Purpose: To review treatment outcomes for stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) in medically operable patients with Stage I non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC), using a Japanese multi-institutional database. Patients and Methods: Between 1995 and 2004, a total of 87 patients with Stage I NSCLC (median age, 74 years; T1N0M0, n = 65; T2N0M0, n = 22) who were medically operable but refused surgery were treated using SBRT alone in 14 institutions. Stereotactic three-dimensional treatment was performed using noncoplanar dynamic arcs or multiple static ports. Total dose was 45-72.5 Gy at the isocenter, administered in 3-10 fractions. Median calculated biological effective dose was 116 Gy (range, 100-141 Gy). Data were collected and analyzed retrospectively. Result(s): During follow-up (median, 55 months), cumulative local control rates for T1 and T2 tumors at 5 years after SBRT were 92% and 73%, respectively. Pulmonary complications above Grade 2 arose in 1 patient (1.1%). Five-year overall survival rates for Stage IA and IB subgroups were 72% and 62%, respectively. One patient who developed local recurrences safely underwent salvage surgery. Conclusion(s): Stereotactic body radiotherapy is safe and promising as a radical treatment for operable Stage I NSCLC. The survival rate for SBRT is potentially comparable to that for surgery. © 2011 Elsevier Inc.",Excluded

594,"Myocardial infarction mortality risk after treatment for hodgkin disease: A collaborative British cohort study Background Myocardial infarction is a major cause of excess long-term mortality in survivors of Hodgkin disease, but limited information exists on the effects of specific chemotherapy regimens used to treat these patients on their risk of death from myocardial infarction. Methods We followed a cohort of 7033 Hodgkin disease patients who were treated in Britain from November 1, 1967, through September 30, 2000, and compared their risk of myocardial infarction mortality with that in the general population of England and Wales. All statistical tests were two-sided. Results A total of 166 deaths from myocardial infarction occurred in the cohort, statistically significantly more than expected(standardized mortality ratio[SMR] = 2.5, 95% confidence interval[CI] = 2.1 to 2.9), with an absolute excess risk of 125.8 per 100000 person-years. Standardized mortality ratios decreased sharply with older age at first treatment, but absolute excess risks of death from myocardial infarction increased with older age up to age 65 years at first treatment. The statistically significantly increased risk of myocardial infarction mortality persisted through to 25 years after first treatment. Risks were increased statistically significantly and independently for patients who had been treated with supradiaphragmatic radiotherapy, anthracyclines, or vincristine. Risk was particularly high for patients treated with the doxorubicin, bleomycin, vinblastine, and dacarbazine regimen(SMR = 9.5, 95% CI = 3.5 to 20.6). Risk at 20 or more years after first treatment was particularly great for patients who had received supradiaphragmatic radiotherapy and vincristine without anthracylines(SMR = 14.8, 95% CI = 4.8 to 34.5). Conclusions The risk of death from myocardial infarction after treatment for Hodgkin disease remains high for at least 25 years. The increased risks are related to supradiaphragmatic radiotherapy but may also be related to anthracycline and vincristine treatment.",Excluded
876,"A questionnaire study to derive information on the working environment, clinical training, use of ancillary staff and optimization of patient radiation dose within UK dental practice Aim To evaluate the working environment of GDPs and Endodontists and the methods used to optimize patient radiation dose. Methodology A total of 857 GDPs and 170 specialist Endodontists were contacted. The responders, 603 of the former and 132 of the latter, completed a questionnaire covering practitioner demographics, pattern of practice, the use of radiographic techniques and the optimization of dose. Chi-squared tests were used to compare groups at the P=0.05 level of significance. For nonparametric data, the Mann-Whitney U-test was employed. Results A response rate of 73% was achieved. Overall, 79.5% of endodontic specialists used film holders compared with 65.9% of GDPs (P=0.001). One hundred and thirty (98.5%) endodontists and 581 (96.3%) GDPs reported that they were well prepared or adequately prepared in radiographically assessing the presence of apical pathosis. The study found significant differences (P<0.001) between the use of digital radiography by specialist endodontists 93 (70.5%) compared with general dental practitioners 167 (27.7%). Significant differences (P=0.004) were also observed in the use of rectangular collimation between endodontic specialists 55 (42%) and GDPs 223 (37%). With regard to the use of film holders in diagnostic radiography, 105 (79.5%) of endodontic specialists employed these devices compared with 396 (65.7%) GDPs; this finding was significant (P=0.005). For working length estimation, significant differences (P=0.001) were noted in the use of a film holder between endodontic specialists 105 (79.5%) and GDPs 386 (64%).

501,"Organ biodistribution of Germanium-68 in rat in the presence and absence of [68Ga]Ga-DOTA-TOC for the extrapolation to the human organ and whole-body radiation dosimetry Positron Emission Tomography (PET) and in particular gallium-68 (68Ga) applications are growing exponentially worldwide contributing to the expansion of nuclear medicine and personalized management of patients. The significance of 68Ga utility is reflected in the implementation of European Pharmacopoeia monographs. However, there is one crucial point in the monographs that might limit the use of the generators and consequently expansion of 68Ga applications and that is the limit of 0.001% of Germanium-68 (68Ge(IV)) radioactivity content in a radiophar-maceutical. We have investigated the organ distribution of 68Ge(IV) in rat and estimated human dosimetry parameters in order to provide experimental evidence for the determination and justification of the 68Ge(IV) limit. Male and female rats were injected in the tail vein with formulated [68Ge]GeCl4 in the absence or presence of [68Ga]Ga-DOTA-TOC. The tissue radioactivity distribution data was extrapolated for the estimation of human organ equivalent doses and total effective dose using Organ Level Internal Dose Assessment Code software (OLINDA/EXM). 68Ge(IV) was evenly distributed among the rat organs and fast renal excretion prevailed. Human organ equivalent dose and total effective dose estimates indicated that the kidneys were the dose-limiting organs (185+/-54 muSv/MBq for female and 171+/-38 muSv/MBq for male) and the total effective dose was 15.5+/-0.1 and 10.7+/-1.2 muSv/MBq, respectively for female and male. The results of this dosimetry study conclude that the 68Ge(IV) limit currently recommended by monographs could be increased considerably (>100 times) without exposing the patient to harm given the small absorbed doses to normal organs and fast excretion.",Excluded
3630,"Whole-Field Sequential Intensity-Modulated Radiotherapy for Local-Regional Advanced Head-and-Neck Squamous Cell Carcinoma PURPOSE: There is little published data on the technique and results of whole-field (WF) sequential intensity-modulated radiotherapy (S-IMRT) for patients with head-and-neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC). We report the treatment outcomes, adverse events (AEs), and dosimetric parameters in local-regional advanced (LRA) HNSCC patients treated with the WF S-IMRT technique., METHODS: The IRB approved this retrospective study. Patients received WF S-IMRT with or without concomitant chemotherapy. Three separate IMRT plans corresponding to 3 planning target volumes were generated. This study reports patient and tumor characteristics, treatment-induced acute AEs based on CTCAE version 3.0, chronic AEs according to RTOG scale and treatment outcomes, local-regional control (LRC), distant metastases (DM), relapse-free survival (RFS), and overall survival (OS)., RESULTS: Between January 2003 and December 2010, 103 patients with LRA HNSCC were treated either definitively or postoperatively with WF S-IMRT, with (99 patients) or without (4 patients) concurrent chemotherapy. The median age was 55 years (range, 30 to 89 y). The median cumulative target dose was 70 Gy (range, 60 to 75 Gy). At a median follow-up of 40 months (range, 4 to 95 mo), the 2- and 5-year rates of OS were 94% and 77%, RFS were 90% and 84%, LRC were 97% and 93%, and DM were 9% and 11%, respectively. Grade 3 acute AEs included mucositis (68%), dysphagia (35%), weight loss (19.6%), and xerostomia (7.8%). Chronic worst grade 3 AEs included xerostomia (21.9%), weight loss (12.8%), and dysphagia (12.5%). Chronic grade 3 AEs at last follow-up included weight loss (6.25%), dysphagia (6.2%), and xerostomia (6.2%).

3036,"The human leulocyte test system. VII. Further investigations concerning micronucleus-derived premature chromosome condensation Premature chromosome condensation (PCC) from X-ray induced micronuclei shows a dose-effect relationship in human leukocytes in vitro. Preparations at different culture times without colcemide treatment reveal complex variations of the frequencies of micronuclei and PCC correlated with the fixation time. The positions of PCC patches in the metaphase plate and the frequencies of different PCC types (S and G2) ar independent on the X-ray dose. The latter indicates that the slowing down of the micronuclei in the cell cycle, which is the reason for the formation of PCC, may be an outcome rather of a regulatory phenomenon than of an unspecific physiological damage of the chromatin included in the micronuclei. This is especially evident from labeling experiments with tritiated thymidine, showing that the extent of asynchrony between main nuclei and micronuclei is independent on the X-ray dose. Labeling experiments with tritiated uridine reveal a X-ray dose dependent suppression of RNA synthesis in cells with main nuclei and micronuclei. THE S-phase nature of ""pulverized"" PCC patches could be verified by incorporation of tritiated thymidine in aound 50%. Staining of centromeric heterochromatin in micronuclei reveal a frequency of micronuclei with centromeric heterochromatin resembling the frequency of G2-phase PCC found in mitoses.",Excluded
1461,"High-dose etoposide could discriminate the benefit from autologous peripheral blood stem cell transplantation in the patients with refractory diffuse large B cell lymphoma To evaluate the strategy of using high-dose etoposide mobilization followed by autologous peripheral blood stem cell transplantation (APBSCT) in patients with diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL) refractory to rituximab-based chemotherapy. Forty patients with refractory DLBCL were treated with high-dose etoposide for stem cell mobilization. All patients were in progressive disease (PD) prior to mobilization and underwent high-dose chemotherapy followed by APBSCT. Successful PBSC mobilization was achieved in all patients. Twenty-three patients (57.5%) showed a clinical response to high-dose etoposide. After APBSCT, 17 patients (42.5%) achieved CR. The 2-year progression-free (PFS) and overall survival (OS) rate were higher in patients responding to high-dose etoposide (64.1% and 77.7%) compared to those without response (11.8% and 11.8%; P < 0.001 for both). The response to high-dose etoposide mobilization therapy was an independent prognostic factor for CR achievement, PFS and OS after APBSCT.

3318,"T1/T2 matching to differentiate tumor growth from radiation effects after stereotactic radiosurgery Objective: We define magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and clinical criteria that differentiate radiation effect (RE) from tumor progression after stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS). Method(s): We correlated postoperative imaging and histopathological data in 68 patients who underwent delayed resection of a brain metastasis after SRS. Surgical resection was required in these patients because of clinical and imaging evidence of lesion progression 0.3 to 27.7 months after SRS. At the time of SRS, the median target volume was 7.1 mL (range, 0.5-26 mL), which increased to 14 mL (range, 1.3-81 mL) at the time of surgery. After initial SRS, routine contrast-enhanced MRI was used to assess tumor response and to detect potential adverse radiation effects. We retrospectively correlated these serial MRIs with the postoperative histopathology to determine if any routine MRI features might differentiate tumor progression from RE. Result(s): The median time from SRS to surgical resection was 6.9 months (range, 0.3-27.7 months). A shorter interval from SRS to resection was associated with a higher rate of tumor recurrence (P = .014). A correspondence between the contrast-enhanced volume on T1-weighted images and the low signal-defined lesion margin on T2-weighted images (""T1/T2 match"") was associated with tumor progression at histopathology (P < .0001). Lack of a clear and defined lesion margin on T2-weighted images compared to the margin of contrast uptake on T1-weighted images (""T1/T2 mismatch"") was significantly associated with a higher rate of RE in pathological specimens (P < .0001). The sensitivity of the T1/T2 mismatch in identifying RE was 83.3%, and the specificity was 91.1%. Conclusion(s): We found that time to progression and T1/T2 mismatch were able to differentiate tumor progression from RE in most patients. When REs are suspected, surgery may not be necessary if patients respond to conservative measures. When tumor progression is suspected, resection or repeat radiosurgery can be effective, depending on the degree of mass effect. © 2010 by the Congress of Neurological Surgeons.",Excluded

1248,"Mechanisms for discomfort glare in central vision PURPOSE: The presence of a bright light source in the visual field can generate visual discomfort. Based on empirical observations we can predict to a reasonable degree of accuracy how uncomfortable a given lighting installation is likely to be; yet very little is known about the mechanism or physiological underpinnings that lead to visual discomfort. This study attempts to elucidate some of the underlying mechanisms by controlling the amount of light reaching the retina and by varying photometric properties of the glare source., METHODS: The participants were required to view a source of light presented against a simulated residential street background in the form of uniform flashes of light of varying intensity. Discomfort-glare thresholds were estimated using a staircase procedure; the dependent variable was retinal illuminance. The size of the glare source and the luminance of the surrounding background were varied systematically., RESULTS: Across glare-source sizes or background luminances the discomfort-glare threshold varied less in terms of retinal illuminance than it did in terms of pupil-plane illuminance or light flux. A two-stage model based on saturation of photoreceptors followed by summation of an edge response signal that defines the edges of the glare-source accurately predicted the data., CONCLUSIONS: Discomfort glare in central vision is more closely associated with the spatial properties of the glare source, such as contrast-defined edges, than the overall amount of light entering the eye. The results suggest that discomfort glare in lighting installations could be reduced while maintaining adequate illuminance levels by an appropriate choice of illuminant source size.

2397,"Tolerability of combined modality therapy for rectal cancer in elderly patients aged 75 years and older Purpose: To determine the rate of treatment deviations during combined modality therapy for rectal cancer in elderly patients aged 75 years and older. Methods and Materials: We reviewed the records of consecutively treated patients with rectal cancer aged 75 years and older treated with combined modality therapy at Massachusetts General Hospital and Brigham & Women's Hospital from 2002 to 2007. The primary endpoint was the rate of treatment deviation, defined as a treatment break, dose reduction, early discontinuation of therapy, or hospitalization during combined modality therapy. Patient comorbidity was rated using the validated Adult Comorbidity Evaluation 27 Test (ACE-27) comorbidity index. Fisher's exact test and the Mantel-Haenszel trend test were used to identify predictors of treatment tolerability. Result(s): Thirty-six eligible patients had a median age of 79.0 years (range, 75-87 years); 53% (19/36) had no or mild comorbidity and 47% (17/36) had moderate or severe comorbidity. In all, 58% of patients (21/36) were treated with preoperative chemoradiotherapy (CRT) and 33% (12/36) with postoperative CRT. Although 92% patients (33/36) completed the planned radiotherapy (RT) dose, 25% (9/36) required an RT-treatment break, 11% (4/36) were hospitalized, and 33% (12/36) had a dose reduction, break, or discontinuation of concurrent chemotherapy. In all, 39% of patients (14/36) completed >=4 months of adjuvant chemotherapy, and 17% (6/36) completed therapy without a treatment deviation. More patients with no to mild comorbidity completed treatment than did patients with moderate to severe comorbidity (21% vs. 12%, p = 0.66). The rate of deviation did not differ between patients who had preoperative or postoperative CRT (19% vs. 17%, p = 1.0). Conclusion(s): The majority of elderly patients with rectal cancer in this series required early termination of treatment, treatment interruptions, or dose reductions. These data suggest that further intensification of combined modality therapy for rectal cancer should be performed with caution in elderly patients, who require aggressive supportive care to complete treatment. © 2011 Elsevier Inc.",Excluded

Diagnostic accuracy was calculated for CTCA, calcium scoring, and for the combination of both. Receiver operator characteristic analyses were performed to determine cutoffs for prediction of significant coronary artery stenoses., RESULTS: Mean effective radiation dose was 2.1 + or - 0.7 mSv (range, 1.0-3.3 mSv) for CTCA and 1.1 + or - 0.1 mSv (range, 0.9-1.4 mSv) for calcium scoring. Per-patient sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value were 100%, 85.7%, 89.2%, and 100% for CTCA, and 72.7%, 82.1%, 82.8%, and 71.9% for calcium scoring. Adding calcium-scoring with a cutoff at 133 in patients aged >50.7 years with nondiagnostic CTCA improved the respective values of diagnostic accuracy of the entire study population to 100%, 96.4%, 97.1%, and 100%; the added value of calcium scoring was confined to only three patients (5%), who were reclassified from false positive to true negative., CONCLUSION: Specificity and PPV of low-dose CTCA may be further improved by combining it with coronary calcium scoring.

2217,"Nucleoid sedimentation analysis of DNA superstructure, gamma-radiation-induced damage and repair in human and chacma baboon (Papia ursinus) peripheral lymphocytes The use of the chacma baboon (Papio ursinus) in radiobiological investigations justifies special attention because it answers many of the criteria of parallelism to the human. The present study was undertaken to establish whether in vitro gamma-radiation effects in chacma baboon and human lymphocytes are comparable. The sensitive and rapid nucleoid sedimentation technique was employed to evaluate in vitro DNA superstructure, damage and repair in readily obtainable radiosensitive peripheral lymphocytes. Dose-response curves after 60Co gamma-irradiation were obtained, and by applying single-hit kinetics of the target theory, an estimation of molecular masses of the supercoiled domains was made. The baboon and human lymphocytes produced analogous results, while an ethidium bromide intercalation study also revealed a similarity in average DNA superhelical density. Lymphocyte DNA repair after 0.5-4.0 Gy gamma-irradiation and repair times from 0.5 to 5.0 h were evaluated. The repair data obtained from baboon and human cells after 2.0 Gy irradiation compared favourably in extent of DNA repair as well as the profiles of the kinetic curves. These findings indicate that the chacma baboon would be a useful and relevant model for further in vivo radiobiological studies on lymphocytes.

3300,"A novel screw guiding method with a screw guide template system for posterior C-2 fixation: Clinical article Object. Accurate insertion of C-2 cervical screws is imperative; however, the procedures for C-2 screw insertion are technically demanding and challenging, especially in cases of C-2 vertebral abnormality. The purpose of this study is to report the effectiveness of the tailor-made screw guide template (SGT) system for placement of C-2 screws, including in cases with abnormalities. Methods. Twenty-three patients who underwent posterior spinal fusion surgery with C-2 cervical screw insertion using the SGT system were included. The preoperative bone image on CT was analyzed using multiplanar imaging software. The trajectory and depth of the screws were designed based on these images, and transparent templates with screw guiding cylinders were created for each lamina. During the operation, after templates were engaged directly to the laminae, drilling, tapping, and screwing were performed through the templates. The authors placed 26 pedicle screws, 12 pars screws, 6 laminar screws, and 4 C1-2 transarticular screws using the SGT system. To assess the accuracy of the screw track under this system, the deviation of the screw axis from the preplanned trajectory was evaluated on postoperative CT and was classified as follows: Class 1 (accurate), a screw axis deviation less than 2 mm from the planned trajectory; Class 2 (inaccurate), 2 mm or more but less than 4 mm; and Class 3 (deviated), 4 mm or more. In addition, to assess the safety of the screw insertion, malpositioning of the screws was also evaluated using the following grading system: Grade 0 (containing), a screw is completely within the wall of the bone structure; Grade 1 (exposure), a screw perforates the wall of the bone structure but more than 50% of the screw diameter remains within the bone; Grade 2 (perforation), a screw perforates the bone structures and more than 50% of the screw diameter is outside the pedicle; and Grade 3 (penetration), a screw perforates completely outside the bone structure. Results. In total, 47 (97.9%) of 48 screws were classified into Class 1 and Grade 0, whereas 1 laminar screw was classified as Class 3 and Grade 2. Mean screw deviations were 0.36 mm in the axial plane (range 0.0-3.8 mm) and 0.30 mm in the sagittal plane (range 0.0-0.8 mm). Conclusions. This study demonstrates that the SGT system provided extremely accurate C-2 cervical screw insertion without configuration of reference points, high-dose radiation from intraoperative 3D navigation, or any registration or probing error evoked by changes in spinal alignment during surgery. A multistep screw placement technique and reliable screw guide cylinders were the key to accurate screw placement using the SGT system. ©AANS, 2014.",Excluded
2289,"Lower body negative pressure counters posture induced increases of intraocular pressure and intracranial pressure Purpose: Recent ophthalmic evaluations of seven astronauts after six-month missions to International Space Station show unexpected vision impairment. In addition, lumbar punctures in four astronauts with optic disc edema showed moderate elevations of cerebral spinal fluid pressure after returning to Earth. This Visual Impairment Intracranial Pressure (VIIP) syndrome is likely related to a headward body fluid shift that elevates intracranial pressure (ICP). We hypothesized that a moderate level of lower body negative pressure (LBNP) would counteract head down, body-tilt, induced elevations in IOP and ICP. Method(s): Twenty-five normal healthy non-smoking volunteers participated in this study (mean age: 31 years). Right and left IOP, ICP (non-invasive ultrasound pulsed phase locked loop), arm blood pressure, and heart rate were measured during the last minute of each testing condition. Subjects were positioned supine (5 mins), sitting (5 mins), 15-degrees head-down tilt (HDT) (5 mins) and ten minutes of HDT with LBNP (25 mmHg). The order of HDT and HDT+LBNP tests were balanced. The right and left IOP values were averaged and used for statistical analysis (significance accepted at p<0.05). Data are presented as mean +/- standard deviation. The change from supine was calculated for IOP values. Result(s): IOP significantly decreased from supine to sitting posture by 3.2 +/- 1.4 mmHg, and increased by 0.9 +/- 1.3 mmHg from supine to the HDT position. LBNP during head-down-tilt significantly lowered IOP to supine levels (difference from supine, 0.3 +/- 1.1 mmHg). In addition, added LBNP during HDT significantly decreased ICP-related pulse amplitudes of transcranial ultrasound waveforms by 2.1+/-3.4 microns (n=9). Mean blood pressure and heart rate did not change significantly across all conditions. Conclusion(s): These data demonstrate that short duration exposures to HDT increase IOP and ICP significantly and further, that LBNP counteracts these elevations of IOP and ICP. Therefore, spaceflight countermeasures that shift fluid to lower body may mitigate vision problems.",Excluded

According to the 1987 International Union Against Cancer (TNM) classification, they were: 19 T1, 70 T2, 22 T3, 7 T4, 94 N0, and 24 N1-3. The treatment started with external beam irradiation (EBI) (36 Gy in 3 weeks or 45 Gy in 5 weeks). Concomitant chemotherapy (5-fluorouracil and mitomycin C) was delivered to 31 patients. Two months later, a boost of 20 Gy was delivered by interstitial 192Ir brachytherapy to 101 patients and EBI in 5. Twelve other patients had an abdominoperineal resection (APR). The mean follow-up was 6 years., RESULTS: At 5 years the overall survival was 60%, and specific survival (SS) was 75%; it was 94% for T1, 79% for T2, 53% for T3, and 19% for T4. In multivariate analysis, tumor size (> or = 4 cm), node involvement, and no response to the EBI were factors of poor prognosis for SS. Thirty-two locoregional recurrences occurred of which 21 were local recurrences in the 106 patients treated by a conservative schedule. Only tumor size and response to the EBI were prognostic factors on multivariate analysis for local and LRC. A total of 17 patients presented with LSC (Grade 3, 16 patients; and Grade 4, 1 patient), which was treated by APR in 4 patients and colostomy in 11 (of which 7 were definitive). The only significant prognostic factor for LSC in the multivariate analysis was the total extrapolated response dose of irradiation. The definitive rate of SC after conservative treatment in cured patients was 100% for T1, 82% for T2, 58% for T3, and 100% for T4. Since 1989, improvements of the technique have allowed reduction of the LSC in maintaining the same local control., CONCLUSION: The results of this series are similar to those of the literature. The confirmation of pretherapeutic prognostic factors related to response to the treatment should allow us to adapt the therapeutic intensity for each case to obtain better tumor control, with as few sequelae as possible, to yield a better rate of SC.",Excluded
1242,"Radiation therapy in the treatment of partially resected meningiomas To address the question of whether radiation therapy is beneficial in the management of partially resected meningiomas, we reviewed the records of all patients admitted to the University of California, San Francisco, between 1968 and 1978 who had a diagnosis of intracranial meningioma. The patients were divided into three groups: 51 patients had gross total resection and did not receive radiation therapy, 30 patients had subtotal resection and no radiation therapy, and 54 patients had subtotal resection followed by radiation therapy. The subtotal resection groups were similar in average age, male:female ratio, and tumor location, which allowed a valid comparison of the effects of irradiation. The recurrence rate in the total resection group was 4% (2 of 51 patients). Among patients in the subtotal resection groups, 60% of nonirradiated patients had a recurrence, compared with only 32% of the irradiated patients. The median time to recurrence was significantly longer in the irradiated group than in the nonirradiated group (125 vs. 66 months, P less than 0.05). There was no complication related to irradiation. These results provide convincing evidence that radiation therapy is beneficial in the treatment of partially resected meningiomas.",Included

The aim of the present study was to assess the dosimetric parameters, toxicity, and treatment outcomes of patients with nasal NK/T-cell lymphoma. Methods and Materials: Between 2003 and 2008, 42 patients with early-stage nasal NK/T-cell lymphoma underwent definitive high-dose and extended involved-field IMRT with or without combination chemotherapy. The median radiation dose to the primary tumor was 50 Gy. The dose-volume histograms of the target volume and critical normal structures were evaluated in all patients. The locoregional control, overall survival, and progression-free survival were calculated using the Kaplan-Meier method. Result(s): The average mean dose delivered to the planning target volume was 55.5 Gy. Only 1.3% and 2.5% of the planning target volume received <90% and 95% of the prescribed dose, respectively, indicating excellent planning target volume coverage. The mean dose and average dose to the parotid glands was 15 Gy and 14 Gy, respectively. With a median follow-up time of 27 months, the 2-year locoregional control, overall survival, and progression-free survivalrate was 93%, 78%, and 74%, respectively. No Grade 4 or 5 acute or late toxicity was reported. Conclusion(s): High-dose and extended involved-field IMRT for patients with early-stage nasal NK/T-cell lymphoma showed favorable locoregional control, overall survival, and progression-free survival, with mild toxicity. The dose constraints of IMRT for the parotid glands can be limited to <20 Gy in these patients. © 2012 Elsevier Inc.",Excluded
1279,"Does Vacuum-assisted Closure Reduce the Risk of Wound Complications in Patients With Lower Extremity Sarcomas Treated With Preoperative Radiation? BACKGROUND: Although preoperative radiation followed by wide local excision yields excellent local control in soft tissue sarcomas, the risk of wound complications is reported to be higher compared with the incidence in patients who were administered postoperative radiation therapy. Vacuum (vac)-assisted closure may improve wound healing, but it is unknown whether vac-assisted closure during soft tissue sarcoma resection may reduce the risk of wound complications or impair local disease control., QUESTIONS/PURPOSES: (1) Does the use of a wound vac application at the time of soft tissue sarcoma resection reduce the risk of developing wound complications after lower extremity sarcoma resection? (2) Is vac-assisted closure associated with an increased risk of local relapse?, METHODS: From 2000 to 2016, 312 patients with stage I to III soft tissue sarcomas were treated. Of these, 123 were treated with preoperative radiation +/- chemotherapy followed by limb-sparing resection based on tumor location, size, grade, histology, and patient age. There was a minimum followup of 12 months. Radiation was delivered generally based on tumor size, grade, superficial versus deep nature, and proximity to neurovascular structures. Chemotherapy was administered in patients < 70 years old with high-grade tumors and tumors > 5 cm. Patient, demographic, and treatment variables, including incisional vac application and wound outcomes, were retrospectively evaluated. Incisional vac-assisted closure took place at the time of primary resection in 32% (46 of 123) of patients. Vac-assisted closure was considered when there was a concern for risk of external contamination such as instances in which fixation of adhesives would be difficult or regions where there was a high risk of contamination. Vac-assisted closure may have also been used in instances with increased wound tension at closure or with heightened concern for shearing on the wound such as buttock wounds. Ten patients were lost to followup, two in the vac group and eight in the non-vac group. Potential factors associated with wound complications were evaluated using Fisher's exact test for univariate analysis and logistic regression for multivariate analysis. Local recurrence-free survival was evaluated using the Kaplan-Meier estimate., RESULTS: After taking into consideration factors such as tumor size, location, age, and patient comorbidities, it was shown that patients who underwent vac-assisted closure were less likely to experience wound complications compared with patients who did not undergo vac-assisted closure (odds ratio, 0.129; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.041-0.398; p = 0.004). The local control incidence in the entire cohort was 98%. With the numbers available, Kaplan-Meier survivorship free from local recurrence did not differ between patients treated with or without the vac (100% [95% CI, 154.09-154.09] versus 96% [95% CI, 152.21-169.16]; p = 0.211), respectively., CONCLUSIONS: Vac-assisted closure at the time of resection of proximal lower extremity soft tissue sarcomas is associated with a lower risk of wound complications, and its use apparently did not compromise local control. We show that the use of vac-assisted closure may be worth considering in surgeons' attempts to reduce the risk of wound complications among patients with soft tissue sarcomas of the proximal lower extremities., LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Level III, therapeutic study.",Included
3,"New radiosensitization treatment (KORTUC-SC) for chemo-resistant supra-clavicular lymph nodes metastasis Purpose/Objective: Linear accelerator-based radiotherapy has little effect on most of locally-advanced neoplasmas that have grown to several centimeters or more. Such tumors contain numerous hypoxic cancer cells and/or large amounts of anti-oxidative enzymes, and are therefore resistant to low linear energy transfer (LET) radiation such as X-rays and electrons from linear accelerators (Linac). We have developed a new radiosensitizer containing hydrogen peroxide & sodium hyaluronate for topical tumor injection for various types of tumors which are not superficially exposed, and the method was named 'KORTUC II'. Safety and effectiveness of the method have already been successfully performed by our clinical trials for patients with unresectable and/or recurrent neoplasms. This study aimed to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of KORTUC II specifically for patients with chemotherapy-resistant supra-clavicular lymph nodes metastasis, and the method was named as KORTUC-SC (KORTUC for supra-clavicular lymph nodes metastasis). For these lesions, curative resection is impossible because of the direct invasion of neoplasms to surrounding cervical great vessels. Therefore new strategies for better local control have been needed. Material(s) and Method(s): This study was performed at Kochi Medical School Hospital between September 2006 and March 2010. Twelve patients (2 men,10 women) with chemotherapy-resistant supraclavicular lymph node metastasis were enrolled into the study after providing fully informed written consent. All the patients underwent PET-CT examinations prior to and at 3 ~ 6 months after KORTUC-SC. We compared these two examination results. Patients were 58 to 77 years old (average age was 65).The radiotherapy regimen was 4 Gy/time, 3 times/week, for 4 weeks, and total dose was 48 Gy. The appropriate energy level of electron beams was selected for individual patients in terms of depth of the target lesion. The injection of 3 to 6 ml of the agent was started from the 5th session of radiotherapy, and was performed twice a week under ultrasonographic guidance. Result(s): The numbers of the patients were 12. Therapeutic effects were evaluated by the FDG-PET performed prior to and following the KORTUC-SC treatment. Treatment was well tolerated, with minimal adverse effects. Of the 12 patients, 6 (50%) showed complete response (CR), 1 (8.3%) showed partial response (PR), 3 (25%) showed stable disease(SD), and another 2 (16.6%) showed progressive disease (PD). Overall survival rate was 83% at 1 year (10/12 patients) and 75% at 2 years (9/12 patients). The mean duration of follow-up at the end of February 2011 was 35.1 months. Conclusion(s): Based on the findings of FDG-PET study, remarkable therapeutic effects of the KORTUC II treatment for chemotherapyresistant supra-clavicular lymph nodes metastasis (KORTUC-SC) were clearly identified. The treatment was well tolerated, with minimal adverse effects such as local pain at the injection site. The treatment outcomes were satisfactory and the adverse events were within the permissible range. This therapy is much less expensive than molecular-targeted therapies in current use, such as Cetuximab. Some well designed prospective randomized clinical trials are needed to confirm the therapeutic efficacy of KORTUC-SC.",Excluded

For that purpose, rats were divided into 4 groups. JNJ7777120 and JNJ7777120-irradiated groups received a daily subcutaneous JNJ7777120 injection (10 mg/kg) starting 24 h before irradiation. Irradiated groups received a single dose of 5 Gy on whole-body using Cesium-137 source and were sacrificed 3 or 30 days after irradiation. Tissues were removed, fixed, stained with hematoxylin and eosin or PAS staining and histological characteristics were evaluated. Proliferative and apoptotic markers were studied by immunohistochemistry, while micronucleus assay was performed to evaluate DNA damage. Submandibular gland (SMG) function was evaluated by methacholine-induced salivation. Results indicate that JNJ7777120 treatment diminished mucosal atrophy and preserved villi and the number of crypts after radiation exposure (240+/-8 vs. 165+/-10, P<0.01). This effect was associated to a reduced apoptosis and DNA damage in intestinal crypts. JNJ7777120 reduced radiation-induced aplasia, preserving medullar components and reducing formation of micronucleus and also it accelerated bone marrow repopulation. Furthermore, it reduced micronucleus frequency in peripheral blood (27+/-8 vs. 149+/-22, in 1,000 erythrocytes, P<0.01). JNJ7777120 completely reversed radiation-induced reduced salivation, conserving glandular mass with normal histological appearance and reducing apoptosis and atrophy of SMG. JNJ7777120 exhibits radioprotective effects against radiation-induced cytotoxic and genotoxic damages in small intestine, SMG and hematopoietic tissues and, thus, could be of clinical value for patients undergoing radiotherapy.",Included

1236,"Light panretinal photocoagulation (LPRP) versus classic panretinal photocoagulation (CPRP) in proliferative diabetic retinopathy PURPOSE: We misled to verify whether a panretinal photocoagulation (PRP) performed using low levels of ARGON laser energy (light PRP) has the same efficacy as a PRP performed in a conventional fashion using argon green wavelengths (classic PRP) in eyes with high-risk proliferative diabetic retinopathy (HRPDR). Furthermore, we misled to compare the session number performed and the side effects produced by the two techniques., METHODS: Sixty-five eyes with HRPDR of 50 consecutive patients were enrolled in a prospective randomized controlled trial. In eyes selected for light PRP, a very light biomicroscopic effect on the retina was obtained for each spot. In eyes assigned to classic PRP, each spot produced a white-yellow biomicroscopic effect. Mean follow-up was 22.4 months +/- 9.7 in the light PRP and 21.6 months +/- 9.3 in the classic PRP group (p = 0.727)., RESULTS: The initial mean logMAR visual acuity (VA) in the light PRP group was 0.12 +/- 0.13 and in the classic PRP group 0.14 +/- 0.15 (p = 0.493). The final mean VA in the former was 0.18 +/- 0.25, and in the latter 0.27 +/- 0.30 (p = 0.231). Median power was 235mW (100-540mW) for light and 420mW (200-950mW) for classic PRP (p < 0.001). Regression of HRPDR at the end of the follow-up was obtained in 30/31 eyes (97%) treated with classic PRP and in 31/34 eyes (91%) treated with light PRP (p = 0.615). The total mean session number was 7.4 +/- 2.4 for light and 9.9 +/- 2.2 for the classic PRP group (p < 0.001). Complications were more frequent in the classic PRP group., CONCLUSIONS: The efficacy of Light PRP is similar to that of classic Light PRP in eyes with HRPDR. Light PRP is associated with fewer complications and allows the reduction of the number of treatment sessions.",Excluded
3132,"Treatment of metastatic gastric adenocarcinoma with image-guided high-dose rate, interstitial brachytherapy as second-line or salvage therapy PURPOSE We aimed to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of image-guided high-dose rate interstitial brachytherapy (iBT) for the treatment of patients with hepatic, lymphatic, and pancreatic metastases originating from gastric cancer, an entity rarely surgically treatable with curative intent. METHODS Twelve patients with a cumulative number of 36 metastases (29 liver, 2 pancreatic, 5 lymph node) from histologically proven gastric adenocarcinoma received iBT between 2010 and 2016 and were retrospectively analyzed. Every patient underwent palliative chemotherapy prior to iBT. The iBT procedure employs a temporarily, intratumorally placed iridium-192 source in a single fraction with the goal of tumor cell eradication. Effectiveness was assessed clinically and by radiologic imaging every three months. RESULTS Local tumor control was achieved in 32 of all treated metastases (89%). Four lesions showed a local recurrence after 7 months. Lesion sizes varied from 9 to 102 mm with a median of 20 mm. The median progression-free survival was 6.6 months (range, 1.8-46.8 months). The median overall survival was 11.4 months (range, 5-47 months). One patient suffered a major complication following iBT, hepatic hematoma and abscess (Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events grade 3), successfully dealt with by transcutaneous drainage. CONCLUSION iBT is an overall safe procedure, which facilitates high rates of local tumor control in treatment of metastatic gastric adenocarcinoma. Compared with surgical metastasectomy, similar overall survival rates could be achieved in our patient collective after iBT application.Copyright © Turkish Society of Radiology 2019.",Excluded

2439,"Risk of isolated nodal failure for stage III NSCLC treated with selective nodal irradiation using IMRT Purpose/Objective: PET-CT based selective nodal irradiation in nonsmall cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients using 3D conformal radiotherapy (RT) results in less than 5% of isolated nodal failures (INF), possibly due to a significant incidental nodal dose. Intensity modulated RT (IMRT) is increasingly used, but decreases the dose to adjacent lymph nodes significantly. This may lead to a higher incidence of INF. We therefore investigated the INF rate in IMRT-treated patients. Material(s) and Method(s): Patients charts from the prospective MAASTRO database were reviewed. Stage III NSCLC patients treated with radical IMRT based RT alone or in combination with sequential (seqCRT) or concurrent (conCRT) chemotherapy were included. An individualized accelerated isotoxic radiotherapy (INDAR) as previously published (JCO 2010; Eur J Cancer 2012) was applied. The primary tumour and FDG-PETpositive and/or cytologically proven lymph nodes were delineated on a 3D-PET-CT fused with a 4D-CT. Follow up (FU) consisted of regular imaging (X-ray and CT) and if clinically indicated. In case of a recurrence, the diagnostic image was compared with the radiation plan. Local tumour and nodal recurrences were scored as follows: in field: at least a part of the recurrence inside the original CTV and out of field: recurrence completely outside the original CTV. Out of field nodal recurrences were classified as recurrences in adjacent or non-adjacent lymph node stations. Overall Survival (OS) and Progression Free Survival (PFS) were calculated from date of pathological diagnosis (Kaplan- Meier). Result(s): From January 2010 until March 2012, 183 patients were included: 119 males, 64 females, median age 68.0 years (Stage IIIA 51.9%, IIIB 48.1%). Median total tumour dose was 69.0 +/- 5.1 Gy (50.4- 73.8 Gy) in a median overall treatment time of 35.0 days. Most patient received chemo-radiation (n=116 conCRT, n=45 seqCRT), while 22 received RT alone. With a median FU of 17.5 months (26.7 months for patients alive) the median OS was 19.0 months (95% CI 16.6-21.4 months) with a 2-year OS of 40.2% (actuarial 2-year OS 38%) for the entire group, 20.2 months for conCRT and 16.0 months for seqCRT (p=0.45). Median PFS was 15.1 months (95% CI 11.3-18.8 months) with a 2-year PFS of 35.3% (actuarial 2-year PFS 34%) for the entire group, 14.1 months for conCRT and 15.7 months for seqCRT (p=0.84). Ninety-nine patients (54.1%) showed recurrent disease: 9.3% (n=17) local recurrence, 1.6% (n=3) isolated nodal recurrence, 2.2% (n=4) loco-regional recurrence, 26.8% (n=49) distant metastases only and 14.2% (n=26) a combination of local/loco-regional and distant metastases. The distribution of all recurrences is depicted in table 1. (Table presented) Conclusion(s): Selective PET-based mediastinal nodal irradiation using IMRT in patients with stage III NSCLC seems to result in a low percentage of isolated nodal failure (1.6%), although FU is still limited.

The objective was to identify former LANL employees who may be at significant risk for occupational disease and determine whether a medical examination program could reduce morbidity or mortality. We describe the needs assessment approach used at LANL., METHODS: An algorithm was developed to make needs determinations. Information on factors including exposure, health impacts, size of exposed populations, and LANL worker concerns and recommendations were obtained. Each of these factors was scored from 1 to 3. The resulting factor sum was then multiplied by a binary (1 or 0) intervention suitability factor which was 1 if both of the following were available: (1) a screening test with acceptable sensitivity and specificity for the health outcome of concern; and (2) an intervention that decreases morbidity or mortality. This resulted in an Intervention Needs Score that was used to set priorities for the medical examination program for the estimated 35,000 former LANL workers., RESULTS: Analysis of the algorithm output suggested that six exposure categories be recommended for consideration in a medical examination program. Beryllium, asbestos, and noise clearly warranted inclusion. Lead and ionizing radiation required careful consideration regarding availability of screening tests. Solvents were problematic due to the lack of screening tests and suitable intervention in formerly exposed workers., CONCLUSIONS: The algorithm approach to the needs assessment at LANL documented that six chemical and physical agents should be considered as candidates for inclusion in a medical examination program for former workers.

858,"The effect of anatomical modeling on space radiation dose estimates: A comparison of doses for NASA phantoms and the 5th, 50th, and 95th percentile male and female astronauts The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) performs organ dosimetry and risk assessment for astronauts using model-normalized measurements of the radiation fields encountered in space. To determine the radiation fields in an organ or tissue of interest, particle transport calculations are performed using self-shielding distributions generated with the computer program CAMERA to represent the human body. CAMERA mathematically traces linear rays (or path lengths) through the computerized anatomical man (CAM) phantom, a computational stylized model developed in the early 1970s with organ and body profiles modeled using solid shapes and scaled to represent the body morphometry of the 1950 50th percentile (PCTL) Air Force male. With the increasing use of voxel phantoms in medical and health physics, a conversion from a mathematical-based to a voxel-based ray-tracing algorithm is warranted. In this study, the voxel-based ray tracer (VoBRaT) is introduced to ray trace voxel phantoms using a modified version of the algorithm first proposed by Siddon (1985 Med. Phys. 12 252-5). After validation, VoBRAT is used to evaluate variations in body self-shielding distributions for NASA phantoms and six University of Florida (UF) hybrid phantoms, scaled to represent the 5th, 50th, and 95th PCTL male and female astronaut body morphometries, which have changed considerably since the inception of CAM. These body self-shielding distributions are used to generate organ dose equivalents and effective doses for five commonly evaluated space radiation environments.

However, to date, there is no studies quantifying the effective dose during MIS-TLIF procedure, and the radiation dose distribution is still unclear. In this study, the surgeons' radiation doses at 5 places on the bodies were measured and the effective doses were assessed during 31 consecutive 1- to 3-level MIS-TLIF surgeries. The operating surgeon, assisting surgeon, and radiological technologist wore thermoluminescent dosimeter on the unshielded thyroid, chest, genitals, right middle finger, and on the chest beneath a lead apron. The doses at the lens and the effective doses were also calculated. Mean fluoroscopy times were 38.7, 53.1, and 58.5 seconds for 1, 2, or 3 fusion levels, respectively. The operating surgeon's mean exposures at the lens, thyroid, chest, genitals, finger, and the chest beneath the shield, respectively, were 0.07, 0.07, 0.09, 0.14, 0.32, and 0.05 mSv in 1-level MIS-TLIF; 0.07, 0.08, 0.09, 0.18, 0.34, and 0.05 mSv in 2-level; 0.08, 0.09, 0.14, 0.15, 0.36, and 0.06 mSv in 3-level; and 0.07, 0.08, 0.10, 0.15, 0.33, and 0.05 mSv in all cases. Mean dose at the operating surgeon's right finger was significantly higher than other measurements parts (P,0.001).

Because irradiation is not always readily available, 5-iodo-2-deoxyuridine (IUDR) treatment of cells was investigated as a substitute procedure. IUDR-treated cells were found to be as sensitive to C. trachomatis infection as were irradiated McCoy cells. Stock chlamydial strains gave similar titers of iodine-stained inclusions in either system. When cells treated with IUDR were compared with irradiated cells for the isolation of C. trachomatis from clinical specimens, 5 of 138 specimens yielded isolates in IUDR-treated cells not found in irradiated ones, and one isolate was obtained from irradiated but not from IUDR-treated cells. In those 56 cases where inclusions were seen in both systems, there were significantly more inclusions in IUDR-treated than in irradiated cells. Although this series of cultures is too small to determine whether IUDR-treated cells are superior to irradiated ones for the isolation of C. trachomatis, the data indicate that IUDR treatment is at least equally effective.",Excluded

The proposed model of excitation by low-level microwave radiation bases on the influence of water polarization on hydrogen bonding forces between water molecules, caused by this the enhancement of diffusion and consequences on neurotransmitters transit time and neuron resting potential. Modulated microwave radiation causes periodic alteration of the neurophysiologic parameters and parametric excitation of brain bioelectric oscillations. The experiments to detect logical outcome of the mechanism on physiological level were carried out on 15 human volunteers. The 450-MHz microwave radiation modulated at 7, 40 and 1000 Hz frequencies was applied at the field power density of 0.16 mW/cm2. A relative change in the EEG power with and without radiation during 10 cycles was used as a quantitative measure. Experimental data demonstrated that modulated at 40 Hz microwave radiation enhanced EEG power in EEG alpha and beta frequency bands. No significant alterations were detected at 7 and 1000 Hz modulation frequencies. These results are in good agreement with the theory of parametric excitation of the brain bioelectric oscillations caused by the periodic alteration of neurophysiologic parameters and support the proposed mechanism. The proposed theoretical framework has been shown to predict the results of experimental study. The suggested mechanism, free of the restrictions related to field strength or time constant, is the first one providing explanation of low-level microwave radiation effects.",Excluded
1539,"Population-based outcomes by immunosuppressed status in patients undergoing radiotherapy for oropharyngeal cancer Introduction: The incidence of immunosuppression in patients with oropharynx head & neck squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) is not well studied. This study evaluates disease characteristics and treatment outcomes in oropharynx SCC in patients with and without immunosuppression. Method(s): A retrospective review of all patients treated with radiotherapy for oropharynx SCC at BC Cancer from 2011 to 2016 was performed. Survival outcomes were assessed using Kaplan-Meier methods and competing risk analysis. Multivariate analysis and propensity score matching were performed. Result(s): There were 1077 patients, of which 5.8% (n = 62) had an immunosuppressive medical condition or were taking long-term immunosuppressive medication at diagnosis. Median follow-up was 3.3 years. Three year OS for patients without immunosuppression was 79.5% (95% Confidence Interval [CI] 76.8-82.0%) and for those with immunosuppression was 64.6% (95% CI 50.9-75.3%) (hazard ratio [HR] 1.78, 95% CI 1.18-2.68, p = 0.0062). The three year disease recurrence for patients without immunosuppression was 24.9% (95% CI 22.2-27.7%) and 44.4% (95% CI 31.5-56.6%) for those with immunosuppression (HR 2.12, 95% CI 1.45-3.11, p = 0.0001). Multivariate analysis of disease free survival (DFS) found that active smoking, advanced TNM stage, base of tongue subsite, p16 negative and unknown, no concurrent chemotherapy, higher Charlson Comorbidity Index, and lower radiation dose were also associated with worse DFS (all p < 0.05). Immunosuppressed patients had worse DFS relative to patients without immunosuppression, p < 0.001, HR 1.97 (95% CI 1.33-2.91). Conclusion(s): Immunosuppression was an independent predictor of worse DFS in this large cohort of patients with oropharynx SCC.Copyright © 2020 Elsevier B.V.",Excluded
2577,"Accelerated hyperfractionated radiotherapy combined with induction and concomitant chemotherapy for inoperable non-small-cell lung cancer: Impact of total treatment time Tumour cell proliferation during conventionally fractionated radiotherapy (RT) can negatively influence the treatment outcome in patients with unresectable non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Accelerated and hyperfractionated RT may therefore have an advantage over conventional RT. Moreover, earlier studies have suggested improved survival with addition of cisplatin-based chemotherapy (CT). We present here the results of combined treatment with induction and concomitant CT and accelerated hyperfractionated RT in a retrospective series of patients with advanced NSCLC. Between August 1990 and August 1995, 90 consecutive patients, aged 42-77 years (median 63 years), with locally advanced unresectable or medically inoperable NSCLC and good performance status were referred for treatment: stage: I 23%, IIIa 37%, IIIb 40%. Patients histologies included: squamous cell carcinoma 52%, adenocarcinoma 34% and large cell carcinoma 13%. The treatment consisted of two courses of CT (cisplatin 100 mg/m2 day 1 and etoposide 100 mg/m2 day 1- 3 i.v.), the second course given concomitantly with RT. The total RT dose was 61.2-64.6 Gy, with two daily fractions of 1.7 Gy. A one-week interval was introduced after 40.8 Gy to reduce acute toxicity, making the total treatment time 4.5 weeks. Concerning toxicity, 33 patients had febrile neutropenia, 10 patients suffered from grade III oesophagitis and 7 patients had grade III pneumonitis. There were two possible treatment-related deaths, one due to myocardial infarction and the other due to a pneumocystis carinii infection. The 1-, 2- and 3-year overall survival rates were 72%, 46% and 34%, respectively; median survival was 21.3 months. Fifty-one patients had progressive disease: 21 failed locoregionally, 29 had distant metastases and 9 patients had a combination of these. Pretreatment weight loss was the only prognostic factor found, except for stage. However, the results for stage IIIb were no different from those for stage IIIa. We conclude that the survival results compare favourably with those of most other studies with a manageable toxicity.",Excluded
2814,"Evaluation of organ-at-risk dose reduction with jaw tracking technique in flattening filter-free beams in lung stereotactic body radiation therapy PURPOSE: (i) to investigate the capability of organ-at-risk (OAR) dose reduction with the jaw tracking (JT) technique in flattening filter-free (FFF) beams in lung stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT), (ii) to propose a novel metric to quantify the jaw movements during JT, and (iii) to examine the relationships between the quantified jaw movements and reduction rate of OAR doses., METHODS: The individual SBRT plans with volumetric modulated arc therapy using the JT technique (JT-VMAT) and VMAT plans with a fixed jaw (FJ-VMAT) were created for 15 patients, and dosimetric parameters were compared. A jaw tracking complexity score (JTCS) was defined and compared with the multi-leaf collimator (MLC) modulation complexity score (MCS). The correlations between the JTCS and reduction rate of OAR doses were examined., RESULTS: The decrease of OARs doses was statistically significant in the JT-VMAT plans (1.2% in V20 of the lung and <1% in all other OARs). The correlations between the JTCS and MCS were not significant. There were significant correlations between the JTCS and the reduction rates in V20, V2.5, and Dmean of the lung, D1% of the spinal cord, and D90% of the body., CONCLUSIONS: A significant decrease of dosimetric parameters of OARs was found with JT-VMAT in FFF beams. This reduction is very small and probably not clinically relevant. JTCS, a novel metric to quantify the jaw movements during JT, was proposed, and the complexity of jaw movements did not correlate with that of the movements of MLC leaves. There were significant correlations between the JTCS and some dosimetric parameters of OARs. Copyright © 2019 Associazione Italiana di Fisica Medica. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

867,"18F-fluorocholine versus 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose for PET/CT imaging in patients with suspected relapsing or progressive multiple myeloma: a pilot study Purpose: Hybrid positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) has now become available, as well as whole-body, low-dose multidetector row computed tomography (MDCT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). The radioactive glucose analogue 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) is the most widely used tracer but has a relatively low sensitivity in detecting multiple myeloma (MM). We compared FDG with a more recent metabolic tracer, 18F-fluorocholine (FCH), for the detection of MM lesions at time of disease relapse or progression. Method(s): We analyzed the results of FDG and FCH imaging in 21 MM patients undergoing PET/CT for suspected relapsing or progressive MM. For each patient and each tracer, an on-site reader and a masked reader independently determined the number of intraosseous and extraosseous foci of tracer and the intensity of uptake as measured by their SUVmax and the corresponding target/non-target ratio (T/NT). Result(s): In the skeleton of 21 patients, no foci were found for two cases, uncountable foci were observed in four patients, including some mismatched FCH/FDG foci. In the 15 patients with countable bone foci, the on-site reader detected 72 FDG foci vs. 127 FCH foci (+76 %), whereas the masked reader detected 69 FDG foci vs. 121 FCH foci (+75 %), both differences being significant. Interobserver agreement on the total number of bone foci was very high, with a kappa coefficient of 0.81 for FDG and 0.89 for FCH. Measurement of uptake in the matched foci that took up both tracers revealed a significantly higher median SUVmax and T/NT for FCH vs. FDG. Almost all unmatched foci were FCH-positive FDG-negative (57/59 = 97 % on-site and 56/60 = 93 % on masked reading); they were more frequently observed than matched foci in the head and neck region. Conclusion(s): These findings suggest that PET/CT performed for suspected relapsing or progressive MM would reveal more lesions when using FCH rather than FDG.Copyright © 2016, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.",Excluded

213,"Clinicopathologic features as stronger prognostic factors than histology or grade in risk stratification of primary parotid malignancies BACKGROUND: The aim of this study, using a retrospective chart review as the primary study design, was to determine the relative contribution of clinicopathologic risk factors versus low- and high-risk grade histologic groups to assist management of primary parotid cancers.
METHODS: In all, 168 primary parotid malignancies were treated surgically at a tertiary care center from 1982 to 2005. Of these, 115 patients with complete follow-up information were further analyzed. Pathologic updating and reclassification in 28% of cases enabled comparison of tumor histology or grade with current consensus criteria. Clinical outcomes of high- and low-risk histology and grade were compared with the influence of traditional clinicopathologic risk factors.
RESULTS: Of 115 cases, the male:female ratio was equal and the median age was 63 years (range, 15 to 89 years). Mucoepidermoid carcinoma (n = 28) was the most common histology. The median follow-up was 44 months (range, 0–278 months). Of low-risk histology patients who underwent neck dissection 40% had pN+ disease. The median time to recurrence was not reached for low-risk tumors, compared with 29 months for high-risk tumors (p = .0001). Interestingly, extracapsular spread (ECS) and margin status were independent prognostic factors and conferred significantly greater prognostic value than histologic grade risk group. Disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS) at 5 years for the entire cohort were 51% and 57%, respectively. Risk group was a strong independent predictor of OS but not DFS.
CONCLUSIONS: Risk group defined by histology and grade was associated with DFS. ECS and margin status were independent predictors of DFS. Inclusion of ECS and margin status substantially improved the prediction of disease recurrence, supporting elective neck dissection and postoperative radiotherapy for high-grade tumors or low-risk histologies with positive margins or ECS.",Excluded
219,"Electron beam radiation for conjunctival squamous carcinoma PURPOSE: To describe the authors' technique and preliminary results using electron beam radiation as rescue therapy for recalcitrant squamous cell carcinoma of the conjunctiva and cornea.
METHODS: A retrospective review comprised of an interventional case series of patients with pathologically confirmed diagnosis of squamous cell carcinoma of the conjunctiva and cornea, who had failed multiple standard treatments and underwent electron beam radiation therapy. Outcomes, radiation-related complications, and adverse effects were documented. Mortality and local control rates were calculated by the Kaplan-Meier survival probability method.
RESULTS: Eight patients met the inclusion criteria; of these, 6 (75%) were men and 2 (25%) were women, with ages ranging from 38 to 65 years (mean 50 years). One tumor (12.5%) was classified as T2N0M0, 6 (75%) were classified as T3N0M0, and one (12.5%) was classified as T4N0M0. Follow up from electron beam radiation therapy ranged from 3 to 72 months (mean 30.25 months). The most common side effect was erythema and edema of the eyelids with diffuse transient eyelash loss, seen in all patients. Tumor local control and regression after electron beam radiation therapy were noted in 6 patients (75%); recurrence was noted in 2. There was neither metastatic spread nor tumor-related deaths.
CONCLUSIONS: The authors report a small case series where local tumor control was achieved with electron beam radiation therapy for recalcitrant squamous cell carcinoma of the conjunctiva and cornea. This approach may be considered for patients who fail conventional therapy.",Excluded
1173,"A preliminary study of the use of ultrasound in defining nasal fractures: Criteria for a confident diagnosis Nasal fractures are usually diagnosed by clinical examination, with or without the support of imaging studies. While plain-film radiography lacks sensitivity and specificity for diagnosing nasal fractures, and computed tomography (CT) is not always practical or cost-effective, ultrasonography (US) may be useful in this regard. The criteria by which adult nasal fractures are reliably identified on US must be clear. We conducted a preliminary prospective, controlled, observational study to define the appearance of nasal fractures on US. We used US to image 12 patients with a clinical or radiologic (CT or x-ray) diagnosis of nasal fracture. All patients presented within 2 weeks of their injury. For comparison purposes, we also obtained US images from 12 control subjects who had no history of nasal trauma or surgery. We found that we could confidently diagnose nasal fractures on lateral-view US on the basis of a disruption of bone continuity and/or displacement of fracture segments. However, our findings were not as consistent with dorsal-view US, and we do not believe it is adequate for diagnosis. We conclude that lateral US can be used to detect nasal fractures in adults, but further studies are needed to assess its sensitivity, specificity, cost-effectiveness, and practicality.",Excluded
336,"Dose escalation via brachytherapy boost for nasopharyngeal carcinoma in the era of intensity-modulated radiation therapy and combined chemotherapy To investigate if dose escalation using intracavitary brachytherapy (ICBT) improves local control for nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) in the era of intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) and concurrent chemoradiation treatment (CCRT). We retrospectively analyzed 232 patients with Stage T1-3 N0-3 M0 NPC who underwent definitive IMRT with or without additional ICBT boost between 2002 and 2013. For most of the 124 patients who had ICBT boost, the additional brachytherapy was given as 6 Gy in 2 fractions completed within 1 week after IMRT of 70 Gy. CCRT with or without adjuvant chemotherapy was used for 176 patients, including 88 with and 88 without ICBT boost, respectively. The mean follow-up time was 63.1 months. The 5-year overall survival and local control rates were 81.5% and 91.5%, respectively. ICBT was not associated with local control prediction (P = 0.228). However, in a subgroup analysis, 75 T1 patients with ICBT boost had significantly better local control than the other 71 T1 patients without ICBT boost (98.1% vs 85.9%, P = 0.020), despite having fewer patients who had undergone chemotherapy (60.0% vs 76.1%, P = 0.038). Multivariate analysis showed that both ICBT (P = 0.029) and chemotherapy (P = 0.047) influenced local control for T1 patients. Our study demonstrated that dose escalation with ICBT can improve local control of the primary tumor for NPC patients with T1 disease treated with IMRT, even without chemotherapy.

3654,"Association between SNPs in defined functional pathways and risk of early or late toxicity as well as individual radiosensitivity BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The aim of this study was to determine the impact of functional single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) pathways involved in the ROS pathway, DNA repair, or TGFB1 signaling on acute or late normal toxicity as well as individual radiosensitivity., MATERIALS AND METHODS: Patients receiving breast-conserving surgery and radiotherapy were examined either for erythema (n = 83), fibrosis (n = 123), or individual radiosensitivity (n = 123). The 17 SNPs analyzed are involved in the ROS pathway (GSTP1, SOD2, NQO1, NOS3, XDH), DNA repair (XRCC1, XRCC3, XRCC6, ERCC2, LIG4, ATM) or TGFB signaling (SKIL, EP300, APC, AXIN1, TGFB1). Associations with biological and clinical endpoints were studied for single SNPs but especially for combinations of SNPs assuming that a SNP is either beneficial or deleterious and needs to be weighted., RESULTS: With one exception, no significant association was seen between a single SNP and the three endpoints studied. No significant associations were also observed when applying a multi-SNP model assuming that each SNP was deleterious. In contrast, significant associations were obtained when SNPs were suggested to be either beneficial or deleterious. These associations increased, when each SNP was weighted individually. Detailed analysis revealed that both erythema and individual radiosensitivity especially depend on SNPs affecting DNA repair and TGFB1 signaling, while SNPs in ROS pathway were of minor importance., CONCLUSION: Functional pathways of SNPs may be used to form a risk score allowing to predict acute and late radiation-induced toxicity but also to unravel the underlying biological mechanisms.",Excluded

3387,"Challenges in the re-irradiation of locally advanced head and neck cancers: outcomes and toxicities Purpose: To retrospectively review outcomes and toxicities for patients with recurrent head and neck cancer (HNC) undergoing re-irradiation (re-RT). Method(s): Retrospective review of oncologic outcomes and toxicity data from patients who received head and neck (HN) re-RT with curative intent using intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) from 2011 to 2016. Common toxicities were scored using Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) V4. Treatment outcomes included progression-free survival (PFS), locoregional control (LRC), and overall survival (OS). Result(s): Twenty-one patients with HNC were re-irradiated with curative intent. The median follow-up after re-RT was 27.8 months. The median retreatment dose was 66 Gy (range, 60-70), and the median retreatment volume was 194.1 cm3 (range, 52.4-1375.6). The median LRC, PFS, and OS were 10 months, 8.4 months, and 18.1 months, respectively. Patients treated with surgery as a component of primary HN cancer treatment had significantly worse PFS and OS when retreated compared with those initially treated with chemoradiation alone (p = 0.026 and p = 0.005, respectively). Those with stage IVA/B recurrent disease had worse LRC, PFS, and OS compared with stage II/III disease (p = 0.029, p = 0.049, and p = 0.020 respectively). Acute grade >= 3 toxicity and late grade >= 3 toxicity were 38% and 38%, respectively, with dysphagia being most common (24% acute and 14% late). Conclusion(s): Re-irradiation with IMRT for locally advanced HN recurrences either definitively or after salvage surgery is feasible, but treatment-related toxicity remains significant. Patients who received surgery as a component of their initial treatment and those with more advanced stage disease may be more difficult to salvage with re-irradiation.Copyright © 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.",Excluded

The aim of this study was to investigate the safety and effectiveness of intraluminal brachytherapy combined with 125I seed implantation and transarterial infusion chemotherapy for the treatment of pancreatic head cancer with obstructive jaundice. Method(s): From October 2012 to January 2018, 21 consecutive patients diagnosed with biliary obstruction caused by locally advanced, nonmetastatic pancreatic cancer with cytologically or histologically confirmed by biopsy were enrolled and receive treatment with intraluminal brachytherapy using 125I seed strand and CT-guided percutaneous radioactive seed implantation therapy. The procedure-related and radiation complications were assessed. The outcomes were measured in terms of stent patency, patient survival, complications related to the procedure. Result(s): One of the 22 patients (4.5%, 1/22) with pancreatic head cancer failed to perform the above procedure because the guidewire was unable to pass through the obstruction segment. The remaining 21 patients (95.5%, 21/22) with pancreatic head cancer with obstructive jaundice were successfully placed with biliary stents and radioactive strips through drainage tubes. The median number of 125I seeds loaded was 15, ranging from 12 to 17. After the chemotherapy with gemcitabine and cisplatin, no adverse reaction of Grade III ~ occurred in all cases. Median stent patency was 12.50 months (95% CI: 10.26, 14.74). By May 2019, all 21 patients had died, with overall survival of 5.2-23.3 months, with a median survival of 13.20 months (95% CI: 10.96, 15.44). Conclusion(s): Percutaneous 125I seed implantation combined with insertion of radioactive strips through the biliary stent has the characteristics of less trauma, fewer complications, simple operation, and so on. These procedures bring remission of obstructive jaundice combined with the increased survival for the treatment of obstructive jaundice caused by unresectable pancreatic head cancer if follow-up chemotherapy is carried out.

771,"Prospects of application of new photosensitizer Elophit"" in photodynamic therapy for treating some dermatologic diseases"" Purpose: Purpose of the present work was to study photosensitizer (PS) Elophit"" effectiveness for PDT sessions in some dermatologic diseases. Material(s) and Method(s): Gel ""Elophit"" is a complex substance containing chlorins E6 (0.5%), copper chlorophyllin (0.5%), hyaluronic acid (2%) (conformance certificate No. ROSS RU.IM; 25130 2322). Therapeutic effects are produced not only due to the chlorin E6 photodynamic (PDT) action but also due to the action of copper derivatives which have anti-inflammatory and immunomodulating effects. The preparation easily penetrates into the skin and accumulates in inflammatory foci. Gel ""Elophit"" was put on skin lesions 40 min before PDT session. Before the session preparation remnants were removed off the skin with a mild alcohol solution. PDT was performed in 12 patients with Acne vulgaris (papulla-pustular form) (4 males, 8 females), 8 patients with superficial forms of streptostaphylodermias (5 males, 3 females). Controls were 24 patients with Acne vulgaris (papulla-pustular form), 20 patients with streptostaphylodermias. Age - 17-58 years old, disease duration from 1 week to 6 years. Patients from the control group received traditional therapy without PDT component.

No changes in clinical picture during PDT treatment was seen in 2 (16.6%) patients with Acne vulgaris and in 1 (12.5%) patients with streptostaphylodermia. In the controls one month later a clinical remission was seen in 10 (41.6%) patients with Acne vulgaris and in 11 (55%) patients with streptostaphylodermias, no changes - in 7 (29.1%) patients with Acne vulgaris and in 6 (30%) patients with streptostaphylodermias, in the rest of patients - a partial rash regression. A fluorescent examination has shown less FS fluorescence (by 60-75%) in the skin after irradiation what indicates a marked phodynamic effect with a considerable discharge of singlet oxygen. Clinical observations have been confirmed by the results of biophotometric examinations of skin lesions when one could see changes typical for decreased or resorpted inflammatory processes. Conclusion(s): Thus, as it has been shown by preliminary findings PDT with photosensitizer ""Elophit"" may be an effective technique for treating some dermatologic pathologies. Further researches are needed to study better effectiveness of PDT with gel ""Elophit"" application in dermatologic practice so as to determine indications and to develop optimal schemes for treatment.""",Excluded
660,"A little to a lot or a lot to a little? An analysis of pneumonitis risk from dose-volume histogram parameters of the lung in patients with lung cancer treated with 3-D conformal radiotherapy PURPOSE: To determine whether a little dose to a large normal lung volume or a high dose to a small lung volume is more critical for induction of clinical pneumonitis. The second question is if dose-volume histogram (DVH) parameters are more reliable, if the lungs are analyzed as separate organs or as a whole organ., PATIENTS AND METHODS: We analyzed the clinical and DVH data from 49 patients treated for a thoracic malignancy using 3-D conformal treatment plans. 18 patients had developed a clinical pneumonitis (CTC II or III). The majority of patients (n = 48) received radiochemotherapy for non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with a combination of paclitaxel and carboplatin. Patients were generally treated 5 fx/week, single dose 2 Gy, using a two-series approach (shrinking field) up to a total dose of 60-70 Gy. For every individual patient, the overall dose distribution was recalculated in the Helax-TMS by means of adding dose plans according to the total dose applied in each series. The lungs were defined both as separate organs and as a whole organ. Low-dose volume ( 10-40 Gy, Vmod) and high-dose volume (> 40 Gy, Vhigh), as well as V10-V40 and mean lung dose (MLD) were defined from the cumulative DVH. Dose-effect relationships were fitted with a logistic regression model., RESULTS: Manifestation of clinical pneumonitis was within 3 months from termination of irradiation in all cases. For the ipsilateral lung, the incidence of pneumonitis was closely correlated to Vhigh. The pneumonitis rate increased from 13% up to 60%. By contrast, with increasing Vlow the pneumonitis rate dropped to < 10%. A similar but less pronounced effect was seen for the total lung. The lung volumes Vlow, Vmod and Vhigh of the ipsilateral, contralateral and whole lung were significantly correlated to the corresponding MLD. The incidence of pneumonitis increased with increasing MLD for the ipsilateral lung with a D50 of 32 Gy and a gamma 50 of 0.98. For the whole lung, the observed increase was less steep. MLD showed a close correlation to NTCP calculated by the Kutcher model. However, NTCP calculation overestimated the pneumonitis risk for the ipsilateral lung and underestimated the risk for the whole lung due to the steeper gradient. The logistic regression curve for the DVH parameters V10-V40 showed an increase of steepness toward higher doses. From the logistic regression curves, a DVH template indicating critical borders of V10-V40 was generated for the ipsilateral as well as for the total lung., CONCLUSION: Our data indicate that it is reasonable to disperse the dose outside the target volume over large areas in order to reduce the volumes of lung receiving > 40 Gy. Reducing the high-dose volume reduces the pneumonitis rate more than a corresponding reduction in the low-dose regions of the DVH. Landmarks for DVH optimization as defined in this analysis may serve as a basis for DVH contrains in IMRT planning. Separate organ analysis produced more reliable results and should be preferred to whole-organ analysis, if techniques mainly involving one side of the lung are applied. Further validation of these constraints is necessary prior to general recommendation.",Excluded
3621,"The role of endothelial nitric oxide synthase gene polymorphisms in patients with lung cancer Objectives: Lung cancer is a disease characterized by uncontrolled cell growth in the lung tissues. The most common causes of lung cancer include smoking, exposure to radon gas, asbestos, environmental pollutants as well as genetic factors. Nitric oxide (NO) has potential mutagenic and carcinogenic activity and may play an important role in lung cancer. Endothelial NO, synthesized from L-arginine by endothelial NO synthase (eNOS), inhibits apoptosis and promotes angiogenesis and tumor cell proliferation. The aim of the present study was to examine the possible relationship between eNOS gene intron 4 variable number of tandem repeat (VNTR) and exon 7-G894T (Glu298Asp) polymorphisms and lung cancer risk. Method(s): DNA was extracted from peripheral blood leukocytes of 107 lung cancer patients and 100 control subjects. Designated polymorphisms were identified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and/or restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP). Result(s): Our study showed that the frequencies of the b/b genotype and b allele of eNOS gene intron 4 VNTR polymorphism were significantly higher in lung cancer patients than in controls (P < 0.05). However, there was no significant association between eNOS gene G894T polymorphism and lung cancer risk (P > 0.05). Conclusion(s): These results suggest that the presence of the intron 4 VNTR* b allele and b/b genotype may be a genetic risk factor for development of lung cancer. Further larger-scale studies are needed to confirm these findings.Copyright © 2020 John Wiley & Sons Ltd",Excluded
261,"Temporal trends of fluoroscopy time and contrast utilization in coronary chronic total occlusion revascularization: insights from a multicenter United States registry BACKGROUND: The impact of operator experience on fluoroscopy time and contrast utilization during percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) of coronary chronic total occlusions (CTOs) has received limited study., METHODS: We evaluated temporal trends in fluoroscopy time and contrast utilization among 1,363 consecutive CTO PCIs performed at three US institutions between January 2006 and November 2011., RESULTS: Mean age was 65 +/- 11 years, 85% of patients were men, 40% had diabetes, 37% had prior coronary artery bypass graft surgery, and 42% had prior PCI. The CTO target vessel was the right coronary artery (55%), circumflex (23%), left anterior descending artery (21%), and left main or bypass graft (1%). The retrograde approach was used in 34% of all procedures. The technical and procedural success rates were 85.5 and 84.2%, respectively. The mean procedural time, fluoroscopy time, and contrast utilization were 113 +/- 61 min, 42 +/- 29 min, and 294 +/- 158 mL, respectively. Years since initiation of CTO PCI were independently associated with higher technical success rate (odds ratio [OR] = 1.52, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.52-1.70, P < 0.001), lower fluoroscopy time (OR = 0.84, 95% CI = 0.75-0.95, P = 0.005), and contrast utilization (OR = 0.84, 95% CI = 0.62-0.79, P < 0.001) during the study period., CONCLUSIONS: Among selected US-based institutions performing CTO PCI, we observed a significant reduction in total fluoroscopy time and contrast utilization paralleled with an improved technical success rate over time.

3255,"Prospective randomised multicenter trial on single fraction radiotherapy (8 Gy x 1) versus multiple fractions (3 Gy x 10) in the treatment of painful bone metastases BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: To investigate whether single-fraction radiotherapy is equal to multiple fractions in the treatment of painful metastases., PATIENTS AND METHODS: The study planned to recruit 1000 patients with painful bone metastases from four Norwegian and six Swedish hospitals. Patients were randomized to single-fraction (8 Gy x 1) or multiple-fraction (3 Gy x 10) radiotherapy. The primary endpoint of the study was pain relief, with fatigue and global quality of life as the secondary endpoints., RESULTS: The data monitoring committee recommended closure of the study after 376 patients had been recruited because interim analyses indicated that, as in two other recently published trials, the treatment groups had similar outcomes. Both groups experienced similar pain relief within the first 4 months, and this was maintained throughout the 28-week follow-up. No differences were found for fatigue and global quality of life. Survival was similar in both groups, with median survival of 8-9 months., CONCLUSIONS: Single-fraction 8 Gy and multiple-fraction radiotherapy provide similar pain benefit. These results, confirming those of other studies, indicate that single-fraction 8 Gy should be standard management policy for these patients.",Excluded

Fifty-four qualified subjects were enrolled. In the natural state, thermal tomography (TTM) was adopted to shoot the thermograms on the face. After the thermograms collection, the thermo-sensitive detection with moxibustion was applied. The suspending moxibustion with moxa stick was used at Xiaguan (ST 7, affected side) for 10 mm. The cases with heat extension and transmission at the acupoint were recorded at the end of moxibustion. In following, the second infrared radiation detection was done so as to record the changes in the infrared images on the face before and after moxibustion and compare the difference in the heat-sensitive state at Xiaguan (ST 7, affected side) in the subjects between two detection methods. Before moxibustion, the infrared radiation intensity at Xiaguan (ST 7, affected side) in the patients displayed mostly low temperature feature and its sensibility (true positive rate) was 65.6%, the specificity (true negative rate) was 68.2% and the accuracy was 66.7%. After moxibustion at Xiaguan (ST 7, affected side), there was an obvious block-diffused increment area of infrared radation along the cheek and its sensitivity (true positive rate) was 81.8%, the specificity (true negative rate) was 81.0% and the accuracy was 81.5% as compared with the moxibustion detection. (1) The heat-sensitive state at Xiaguan (ST 7, affected side) in the patients of primary trigeminal neuralgia can be objectively displayed by infrared imaging to a certain extent.

3243,"[Technique and radiation dose of conventional X-rays and computed tomography of the sacroiliac joint] Anterior-posterior (a.p.) or posterior-anterior X-rays of the sacroiliac joint, sometimes supplemented by a transverse view, have been the method of choice for diagnosis of patients suspected of having sacroiliitis. The sensitivity and specificity of conventional X-rays are relatively low, which can delay the diagnosis of sacroiliitis. Computed tomography (CT) is superior to conventional X-rays for diagnosis of sacroiliitis, but does emit a relatively higher dose of radiation. For this reason, particularly for females, CT should be optimized by employing semi-coronal planes which require a lower radiation dose than axial planes. CT in a semi-coronal plane causes minimal radiation to the ovaries, and the effective radiation dose for women might even be lower than with conventional AP X-rays. Therefore, for suspected sacroiliitis in young women, CT in the semi-coronal plane is the preferred imaging method with respect to diagnostics and radiation protection when magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is not available. Male gonads can be protected from radiation doses in conventional X-rays, and CT as the primary imaging method can only be justified in these cases because of its better diagnostic capabilities. Due to the lack of inherent risk factors, MRI is superior to CT for diagnostics since it provides images of inflammatory signs in addition to joint destruction. Thus, when available, MRI should be given preference for diagnosis of sacroiliitis.",Excluded

1563,"Injectable bone graft for the repair of nonunion of midshaft clavicular fracture after internal fixation BACKGROUND: Treatment of nonunion of clavicular fractures usually requires the insertion of bone material to facilitate bone healing. Injectable bone grafts have been successfully used in the treatment of limb fractures and lumbar fusion. However, there are few studies on its use in the treatment of nonunion. OBJECTIVE(S): To investigate the clinical effect of injection bone graft in the treatment of nonunion of clavicle fracture after internal fixation. METHOD(S): Totally 13 patients (9 males and 4 females aged 19-54 years old) with nonunion after internal fixation of clavicular fractures in the middle segment of the clavicle, who were treated in the No. 908 Hospital of Joint Logistic Support Force of Chinese PLA from January 2015 to December 2016, were selected. All of them were treated with ALLOMATRIX injection bone graft. Postoperative follow-up was conducted for 12 months. The fracture healing quality was evaluated by Lane-Sandhu X-ray score, and the shoulder joint function was evaluated by Constant score. This experiment was approved by the Ethics Committee of No. 908 Hospital of Joint Logistic Support Force of Chinese PLA. RESULTS AND CONCLUSION(S): (1) All the 13 patients received osseous healing, which lasted 8-16 weeks, and no complications such as infection, dislocation, or fixator loosening occurred. (2) The total Lane-Sandhu X-ray score of 13 patients at 3 months and the last follow-up was higher than that before the operation (P < 0. 05).

2766,"Anaplastic thyroid carcinoma: comparison of conventional radiotherapy and hyperfractionation chemoradiotherapy in two groups Anaplastic thyroid carcinoma (ATC) is a highly aggressive neoplasm with a poor prognosis. Curative management of these tumors has been difficult secondary to delayed diagnosis and advanced disease at presentation. Treatment modalities including surgery and fractionated radiotherapy have had limited success in controlling these tumors. Median survival time is often measured in months. A review of all patients treated between 1952 and 1999 identified 32 patients with anaplastic or poorly differentiated thyroid carcinoma. Patients were divided into two groups: those treated between 1952 to 1980 (9 patients, group 1) and those treated between 1981 and 1999 (23 patients, group 2). Most group 1 patients received once-daily radiotherapy and most group 2 patients received twice-daily radiotherapy with concurrent chemotherapy. A variety of radiotherapy techniques were used. Chemotherapy consisted of doxorubicin, paclitaxel, vincristine, or cisplatin. Eleven patients presented with lymph node metastasis and two patients had distant metastases at diagnosis. The most common clinical presentation was a neck mass in 17 patients. In group 1, one patient was treated with surgery only, four with surgery and radiotherapy and four with radiotherapy alone. In group 2, 1 patient was treated with surgery only; 3 with surgery and radiotherapy; 10 with radiotherapy and chemotherapy; 5 with surgery, radiotherapy, and chemotherapy; and 5 with radiotherapy alone. Overall 2-year survival rates were 44% for group 1 and 52% for group 2. Two-year progression-free survival (PFS) was 53% for group 1 and 38% for group 2. Five (16%) patients died within 60 days of diagnosis. Severe side effects included skin sequelae (one patient) and osteoradionecrosis of the mandible (one patient). There were 10 (52%) long-term survivors (>2 years). Clinicopathologic features associated with extended survival were limited extent of disease and inclusion in group 2. Among patients with ATC surgery, hyperfractionated radiotherapy in conjunction with chemotherapy is associated with better survival but not PFS compared to conventional radiotherapy.",Excluded
127,"Cerebrovascular diseases in nuclear workers first employed at the Mayak PA in 1948-1972 Incidence and mortality from cerebrovascular diseases (CVD) (430-438 ICD-9 codes) have been studied in a cohort of 18,763 workers first employed at the Mayak Production Association (Mayak PA) in 1948-1972 and followed up to the end of 2005. Some of the workers were exposed to external gamma-rays only while others were exposed to a mixture of external gamma-rays and internal alpha-particle radiation due to incorporated (239)Pu. After adjusting for non-radiation factors, there were significantly increasing trends in CVD incidence with total absorbed dose from external gamma-rays and total absorbed dose to liver from internal alpha radiation. The CVD incidence was statistically significantly higher among workers with total absorbed external gamma-ray doses greater than 0.20 Gy compared to those exposed to lower doses; the data were consistent with a linear trend in risk with external dose. The CVD incidence was statistically significantly higher among workers with total absorbed internal alpha-radiation doses to liver from incorporated (239)Pu greater than 0.025 Gy compared to those exposed to lower doses. There was no statistically significant trend in CVD mortality risk with either external gamma-ray dose or internal alpha-radiation dose to liver. The risk estimates obtained are generally compatible with those from other large occupational studies, although the incidence data point to higher risk estimates compared to those from the Japanese A-bomb survivors. Further studies of the unique cohort of Mayak workers chronically exposed to external and internal radiation will allow improving the reliability and validating the radiation safety standards for occupational and public exposure.",Included
2907,"Feasibility and safety of extended adjuvant temozolomide beyond six cycles for patients with glioblastoma Introduction: Temozolomide is the first chemotherapeutic agent proven effective for patients with newly diagnosed glioblastoma. The drug is well tolerated for its low toxicity. The current standard practice is concomitant chemoradiotherapy for 6 weeks followed by 6 cycles of adjuvant temozolomide. Some Caucasian studies have suggested that patients might benefit from extended adjuvant cycles of temozolomide (>6 cycles) to lengthen both progression-free survival and overall survival. In the present study, we compared differences in survival and toxicity profile between patients who received conventional 6-cycle temozolomide and those who received more than 6 cycles of temozolomide. Method(s): Patients with newly diagnosed glioblastoma without progressive disease and completed concomitant chemoradiotherapy during a 4-year period were studied. Progression-free survival was compared using Kaplan-Meier survival curves. t Test, U test, and correlation were chosen accordingly to examine the impact of age, extent of resection, MGMT promoter methylation status and adjuvant cycles on progression-free survival. For factors with a P value of <0.05 in univariate analyses, Cox regression hazard model was adopted to determine the strongest factors related to progression-free survival. Result(s): The median progression-free survival was 17.0 months for patients who received 6 cycles of temozolomide (n=7) and 43.4 months for those who received more than 6 cycles (n=7) [P=0.007, log-rank test]. Two patients in the former group and one in the latter group encountered grade 1 toxicity and recovered following dose adjustment. Cycles of adjuvant temozolomide were correlated with progression-free survival (P=0.016, hazard ratio=0.68). Conclusion(s): Extended cycles of temozolomide are safe and feasible for Chinese patients with disease responsive to temozolomide.Copyright © 2017, Hong Kong Academy of Medicine Press.

3216,"Cardiac-CTand transoesophageal echocardiography comparison for left atrial appendage clots detection in patients referred for left atrial interventional procedures Introduction: Left atrial appendage (LAA) was identified as a main location of clots formation (91% in non-valvular AF), and it is related with stroke and systemic embolic events. Presence of LAA clots is a contraindication to left atrial interventional procedures as pulmonary veins isolation or LAA percutaneous closure. Transoeophageal echocardiography (TEE) is the gold standard technique for exclude LAA clots, but other imaging modalities are emerging for this indication. Our aim was compare TEE and CT diagnostic performance for exclude LAA thrombus in patients referred for left atrium interventional procedure. Material(s) and Method(s): All patients studied with TEE (Philips EPIQ-7) and CT (Philips iCT-256) previous LAA percutaneous closure or pulmonary vein isolation procedures between May/2015 and May/2016 were included. LAA was studied with TTE in mid-esophageal views at 0degree, 45degree, 90degree, 135degree. LAA clot, spontaneous echo-contrast and low LAA velocities were assessed with TEE. CT was performed in two-phase scan (early arterial and venous phase with 70-90 sec delay), for detect filling defects in one or both phases. Result(s): 52 patients were included (67+/-15 years, 75% male). Main structural values were LV ejection fraction 57+/-11%, LA indexed volume 84 ml/m2, atrial fibrillation prevalence 46%. Procedure indication was 50% for LAA closure and 50% for pulmonary veins isolation. TEE detected 1.9% LAA clot (one patient), spontaneous echo-contrast 17,3% and low LAA velocities at 9.6%. Assessment with CT detected 1.9% LAA clot (1 case) and arterial defect at 17.3%. LAA clots cases are no coincident between both techniques (Pearson 0.02 p-value 0.889). Spontaneous echo-contrast was detected in 9 patients with TEE, 6 of them had arterial defect also at CT. On the other hand, arterial defect was detected at 9 with CT, 6 of them with spontaneous echo-contrast at TEE (Pearson 0.595 p-value <0.001). After comparison between indications there were differences in LAA defects prevalence. Previous LAA closure, TEE and CT detected thrombus at 3.8% (1 case) but are no coincident. TEE prevalence of spontaneous echo-contrast 30.8% and low flow velocity 19.2%; while with CT arterial defect 30.8% (Pearson 0.632 p-value 0-001). Previous pulmonary vein isolation TEE no detected any LAA defects and CT detected arterial defect but not at venous phase in one patient. Security data related with CT were 75 ml average of ionidated contrast (Visipaque 320mg), and a mean of radiation dose of 4.4 mSv. Conclusion(s): In our sample, LAA clots had a low prevalence. Both techniques detected a clot which it was no detected by the other modality. Instead, assessment of spontaneous echo-contrast or arterial defects had a moderate diagnostic correlation. A combined strategy with both techniques could improve the accuracy of LAA thrombus exclusion, especially in patients with LAA closure indication.",Excluded
2251,"Long term effects of radiation exposure on telomere lengths of leukocytes and its associated biomarkers among atomic-bomb survivors Ionizing radiation (IR) is a major source of cellular damage and the immediate cellular response to IR has been well characterized. But the long-term impact of IR on cell function and its relationship with aging are not known. Here, we examined the IR effects on telomere length and other biomarkers 50 to 68 years post-exposure (two time points per person) in survivors of the atomic bombing at Hiroshima during WWII. We found that telomere length of leukocytes was inversely correlated with the dose of IR (p=0.008), and this effect was primarily found in survivors who were exposed at younger ages; specifically those <12 years old (p=0.0004). Although a dose-related retardation of telomere shortening with age was observed in the cross-sectional data, longitudinal follow-up after 11 years did not show IR exposure-related alteration of the rate of telomere shortening with age. In addition, IR diminished the associations between telomere length and selected aging biomarkers that were observed in survivors with no dose. These included uric acid metabolism, cytokines, and blood T cell counts. These findings showed long-lasting detrimental effects of IR on telomere length of leukocytes in both dose- and age-at-exposure dependent manner, and on alterations of biomarkers with aging.",Included

Due to an inhibitory effect of radiation on cell proliferation the assay yields satisfactory results only when the absorbed dose is below about 5Gy. In 2002 Muller and Rode suggested that a modified version of the test, based on the analysis of the ratio of trinucleated to tetranucleated cells and the frequency of micronuclei (Mn) in binucleated cells containing at least one Mn, can be applied to detect a dose reaching 15Gy (Mutat. Res. 502 (2002) 47-51). Their conclusion was based on the results of experiments with lymphocytes from one donor and nothing is known about the possible influence of individual variability on the applicability of the Mn test to detect high doses of radiation. The aim of the present study was to validate the modified micronucleus assay with lymphocytes of 5 donors. Their blood was exposed to 0, 5, 10, 15 and 20Gy of 60Co gamma rays. The levels of Mn and of cell proliferation were assessed using various approaches. A strong inter-individual variability was observed for all endpoints.

1620,"Patterns of long-term swallowing dysfunction after definitive radiotherapy or chemoradiation Objectives To identify patterns of long-term, radiation-induced swallowing dysfunction after definitive radiotherapy with or without chemotherapy (RT or CHRT) and to determine which factors may explain these patterns over time. Material and methods The study population consisted of 238 consecutive head and neck cancer patients treated with RT or CHRT. The primary endpoint was >=grade 2 swallowing dysfunction at 6, 12, 18 and 24 months after treatment. Cluster analysis was used to identify different patterns over time. The differences between the mean dose to the swallowing organs at risk for each pattern were determined by using dose maps. Results The cluster analysis revealed five patterns of swallowing dysfunction: low persistent, intermediate persistent, severe persistent, transient and progressive. Patients with high dose to the upper pharyngeal, laryngeal and lower pharyngeal region had the highest risk of severe persistent swallowing dysfunction. Transient problems mainly occurred after high dose to the laryngeal and lower pharyngeal regions, combined with moderate dose to the upper pharyngeal region. The progressive pattern was mainly seen after moderate dose to the upper pharyngeal region. Conclusions Various patterns of swallowing dysfunction after definitive RT or CHRT can be identified over time.

As reference, 390 participants with regular heart rates <=65 bpm were used. All participants underwent prospectively electrocardiographically(ECG)-triggered imaging of the coronary arteries using dual source CT at 120kVp, 80 ref mAs using both high-pitch spiral mode and sequential mode. Radiation dose, Agatston score, number of positive scores, as well as median absolute difference of the Agatston score were determined and participants were stratified into CVD risk categories., RESULTS: A similar percentage of participants with low heart rates and high heart rates had a positive CAC score in data sets acquired in high-pitch spiral (low heart rate: 57.7%, high heart rate: 55.8%) and sequential mode (58.0%, 54.7%, p=n.s.). The median absolute difference in Agatston scores between acquisition modes was 14.2% and 9.2%, for the high and low heart rate groups, respectively. Excellent agreement for risk categorization between the two data acquisition modes was found for the high (kappa=0.927) and low (kappa=0.946) heart rate groups. Radiation dose was 48% lower for high-pitch spiral versus sequential acquisitions., CONCLUSION: Radiation dose for the quantification of coronary calcium can be reduced by 48% when using the high-pitch spiral acquisition mode compared to the sequential mode in participants with a regular high heart rate. CVD risk stratification agreement between the two modes of data acquisition is excellent. Copyright © 2018 Society of Cardiovascular Computed Tomography. Published by Elsevier Inc.

Method(s): Retrospective review was performed of 72 patients with spinal metastases treated with stereotactic ablative radiation therapy at a single center between 2002 and 2014. PET/CT was used to calculate SUVs for spinal metastases, and treatment planning was based on PET/CT results. Preoperative and postoperative pain levels were assessed in all patients. Result(s): Reduction in pain scores was found in 78% of treated patients. A significant reduction in pain was identified in patients with >5 metastases compared with fewer lesions (P < 0.05). Degree of change in SUV did not correlate significantly with pain relief. However, comparing pretreatment and posttreatment PET/CT, patients with improved pain consistently displayed decreased SUV. Conclusion(s): PET/CT was shown to be a useful adjunct in radiation treatment planning with change in SUV correlating with symptomatic improvement. This study paves the way for future prospective studies to further assess utility and cost-effectiveness of this imaging modality in radiation treatment planning for spinal metastases.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.",Excluded
2748,"Computer-aided pulmonary nodule detection - performance of two CAD systems at different CT dose levels PURPOSE: To evaluate the impact of dose reduction on the performance of computer-aided lung nodule detection systems (CAD) of two manufacturers by comparing respective CAD results on ultra-low-dose computed tomography (ULD-CT) and standard dose CT (SD-CT)., MATERIALS AND METHODS: Multi-slice computed tomography (MSCT) data sets of 26 patients (13 male and 13 female, patients 31 - 74 years old) were retrospectively selected for CAD analysis. Indication for CT examination was staging of a known primary malignancy or suspected pulmonary malignancy. CT images were consecutively acquired at 5 mAs (ULD-CT) and 75 mAs (SD-CT) with 120 kV tube voltage (1 mm slice thickness). The standard of reference was determined by three experienced readers in consensus. CAD reading algorithms (pre-commercial CAD system, Philips, Netherlands: CAD-1; LungCARE, Siemens, Germany: CAD-2) were applied to the CT data sets., RESULTS: Consensus reading identified 253 nodules on SD-CT and ULD-CT. Nodules ranged in diameter between 2 and 41 mm (mean diameter 4.8 mm). Detection rates were recorded with 72 % and 62 % (CAD-1 vs. CAD-2) for SD-CT and with 73 % and 56 % for ULD-CT. Median false positive rates per patient were calculated with 6 and 5 (CAD-1 vs. CAD-2) for SD-CT and with 8 and 3 for ULD-CT. After separate statistical analysis of nodules with diameters of 5 mm and greater, the detection rates increased to 83 % and 61 % for SD-CT and to 89 % and 67 % for ULD-CT (CAD-1 vs. CAD-2). For both CAD systems there were no significant differences between the detection rates for standard and ultra-low-dose data sets (p > 0.05)., CONCLUSION: Dose reduction of the underlying CT scan did not significantly influence nodule detection performance of the tested CAD systems.",Excluded
1524,"Effects of irradiation on nasal mucociliary clearance in head and neck cancer patients A prospective longitudinal study was conducted on fifty patients of histopathologically confirmed head and neck cancer with the main aim to assess the nasal mucociliary clearance, pre- and post-irradiation; and to compare the findings with the healthy non-irradiated age and sex-matched controls. All the patients underwent saccharin particle test for nasal mucociliary clearance before commencement of radiation therapy and again within 6 months of completion of radiation therapy. The difference between the saccharin perception times of nasal mucosa in the healthy non-irradiated controls and the pre-irradiated head and neck cancer patients were statistically insignificant (P> 0.05). But, the difference between the saccharin perception times of nasal mucosa in the pre- and post-irradiated head and neck cancer patients was found to be statistically significant (P=0). It is concluded that even indirect irradiation of nasal mucosa in head and neck cancer patients significantly affect its ciliary activity. Significance of total radiation dosage along with chemotherapy in some cases was also studied.",Excluded
2697,"Bone loss in very early inflammatory back pain in undifferentiated spondyloarthropathy: A 1-year observational study Objective: Bone loss in patients with inflammatory back pain (IBP) suspicious of early undifferentiated spondyloarthropathy is poorly defined. The aim of this study was to examine changes in bone mineral density (BMD) at the hip, lumbar spine and hand in patients with early IBP and to look for possible biomarkers associated with this change. Method(s): In 30 patients with early IBP, clinical data were collected and BMD assessed using dual energy x-ray absorptiometry at baseline, 6 and 12 months. Further imaging performed included MRI of the sacroiliac joints (SIJs) and spine at baseline and x-rays of the SIJs at baseline and after 8 years. Result(s): After 12 months no significant reduction in hip, spine and hand BMD was seen at the group level. However, hip bone loss was found to be associated with raised baseline C-reactive protein levels, baseline MRI bone marrow oedema of the SIJs and the presence of radiographic sacroiliitis after 8 years. No association was found with change in spine and hand BMD. Conclusion(s): Systemic bone loss in the hip is an early feature of the inflammatory disease process in patients with IBP in undifferentiated spondyloarthropathy and is related to disease activity. These data highlight the importance of aggressive intervention in the early stages of disease in undifferentiated spondyloarthropathy.",Excluded
330,"Experienced Mindfulness Meditators Exhibit Higher Parietal-Occipital EEG Gamma Activity during NREM Sleep Over the past several years meditation practice has gained increasing attention as a non-pharmacological intervention to provide health related benefits, from promoting general wellness to alleviating the symptoms of a variety of medical conditions. However, the effects of meditation training on brain activity still need to be fully characterized. Sleep provides a unique approach to explore the meditation-related plastic changes in brain function. In this study we performed sleep high-density electroencephalographic (hdEEG) recordings in long-term meditators (LTM) of Buddhist meditation practices (approximately 8700 mean hours of life practice) and meditation naive individuals. We found that LTM had increased parietal-occipital EEG gamma power during NREM sleep. This increase was specific for the gamma range (25-40 Hz), was not related to the level of spontaneous arousal during NREM and was positively correlated with the length of lifetime daily meditation practice. Altogether, these findings indicate that meditation practice produces measurable changes in spontaneous brain activity, and suggest that EEG gamma activity during sleep represents a sensitive measure of the long-lasting, plastic effects of meditative training on brain function. © 2013 Ferrarelli et al.",Excluded
3183,"Preoperative chemoradiotherapy for pancreatic cancer encountered vertebral compression fractures Background: Preoperative chemoradiotherapy (CRT) with gemcitabine (GEM) for pancreatic cancer at our institute achieved excellent cure rates, while treated patients encountered vertebral compression fractures (VCFs) frequently. Method(s): From January 2006 to December 2011, 220 patients (male/female: 134/86, median age: 66 (range: 33-84)) with resectable pancreatic cancer have been treated with preoperative CRT with GEM. This method consisted of concurrent radiotherapy (50-60 Gy in 25 fractions over 5 weeks) and chemotherapy (GEM 1,000 mg/m2intravenous, weekly for 12-15 weeks, 3 times during 4 weeks). Three-dimensional conformal radiotherapy was used and its fields covered both primary pancreatic tumor and retropancreatic tissues with 50 Gy level. Boost irradiation to the roots of celiac and superior mesenteric arteries with 2.4 Gy/fr using field-within-field technique has been started since 2009. The risk factors for VCF and its causes were retrospectively analyzed for 1,308 Th10-L3 vertebral bodies. Result(s): Follow-up time from the initiation of CRT ranged from 3.4-73.9 months (median: 17.9). Median overall survival time of these patients was 40.6 months. Radical surgery was completed in 164 patients (75%). Twenty-five patients (11%) diagnosed as VCF (CTCAE v4.0 grade1/2: 12/13) and 22 of them were at 3.6-23 months from CRT. Cumulative incidence rates at 2 years were 18.9% in total, 8.5% in male and 38.4% in female (p = 0.0002). Corresponding rates were 5.1% in age < 60 and 24.9% in age >= 60 (p = 0.0107). On their courses 37 de novo VCFs (Th10/11/12/L1/2/3: 2/3/11/13/7/1) were observed at first and 9 patients repeated VCFs near the initial VCFs. Dose-volume factors of each vertebral bodies also significantly correlated with VCF; vertebrae whose mean dose were < 38 Gy/ >= 38 Gy developed VCFs in 2.7%/10.0% at 2 years (p < 0.0001), vertebrae whose V30 were < 80%/>=80% developed VCFs in 2.4%/10.6% (p < 0.0001). Conclusion(s): Besides women and higher age, dose-volume factors of radiotherapy were risk of developing VCF in patients with pancreatic cancer after preoperative CRT with GEM. These findings should be considered to avoid VCFs as late adverse event after CRT for pancreatic cancer, especially in IMRT era.",Excluded
906,"The characteristics of esophagogastric junction contractile index in patients with gastroesophageal reflux disease or functional heartburn OBJECTIVE: To study the role of esophagogastric junction contractile index (EGJ-CI) in evaluating the function of anti-reflux barrier, and in differentiating patients with gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) from those with functional heartburn (FH)., METHODS: A total of 115 patients presenting heartburn were enrolled in the study from January 2012 to June 2015.All subjects had completed Gerd-Q questionnaire and undergone gastroscopy, 24-hour pH-impedance monitoring and esophageal high-resolution manometry. GERD patients were divided into as reflux esophagitis, acid-nonerosive reflux disease (NERD) and weakly acid-NERD groups. Patients with normal esophageal mucosa, normal acid exposure and negative proton pump inhibitor test were enrolled in FH group. EGJ-CI (mmHg.cm) as well as EGJ rest pressure and 4s integrated relaxation pressure (IRP 4s) were measured., RESULTS: Among the 115 patients, 18 were reflux esophagitis [(49.0+/-18.9) years, M:F=10:8], 25 were acid-NERD [(48.7+/-14.4) years, M:F=13:12], 37 were weakly acid-NERD [(52.0+/-14.8) years, M:F=15:22] and 35 were FH [(53.6+/-14.8), M:F=8:27]. No differences of Gerd-Q scores were noticed between the four groups. (1)Negative correlations were demonstrated between EGJ-CI and esophageal acid exposure time (r=-0.283, P=0.002), EGJ-CI and acid reflux events (r=-0.233, P=0.012), EGJ-CI and weakly acid reflux events (r=-0.213, P=0.022), EGJ-CI and non-acid reflux events (r=-0.200, P=0.032). (2)The value of EGJ-CI was significantly higher in FH patients than in the three subgroups of GERD(all P<0.01). EGJ rest pressure of FH group was higher than that of acid-NERD (P<0.01). IRP 4s in acid-NERD group was lower than that of FH and weakly acid-NERD (P<0.05). (3)The area under curve (AUC) of EGJ-CI was higher than that of EGJ-CIT, EGJ rest pressure or IRP 4s(0.686 vs 0.678, 0.641 and 0.578). The cut-off value of EGJ-CI to differentiate GERD from FH was 9.74 mmHg.cm with sensitivity 82.86% and specificity 51.52%., CONCLUSIONS: The EGJ-CI values are negatively correlated with esophageal acid exposure time, weakly acid reflux events and non-acid reflux events. Thus it might be used as a metric to reflect the anti-reflux function of EGJ. According to the cut-off value of EGJ-CI 9.74 mmHg.cm, patients with GERD can be sensitively differentiated from patients with FH.",Excluded
1635,"Sargramostim accelerates leukocyte recovery and improves mortality rate at day 60 in a non-human primate model of hematopoietic acute radiation syndrome when administered 48 h after total body irradiation Background: Hematopoietic acute radiation syndrome (H-ARS) occurs in individuals that are exposed to high levels of radiation over a short period of time. The destruction of bone marrow leads to pancytopenia, which increases the incidence of infections and accounts for the majority of morbidity and mortality. Sargramostim (yeast-derived rhGM-CSF) is a leukocyte growth factor that promotes differentiation, maturation and activation of granulocytes, monocytes and macrophages. Method(s): We evaluated the efficacy of repeat administrations of sargramostim (7 mug/kg/day) in a blinded, GLP study in total body irradiated non-human primates (NHPs) when administered 48 h postirradiation with minimal supportive care (e.g., no blood products or individualized antibiotics). The primary objective was to assess the efficacy of sargramostim versus vehicle on mortality rate at Day 60 in irradiated male and female NHPs at LD50-60/60 (n=36/group). Secondary objectives included the efficacy of sargramostim on overall survival and its effect on hematology parameters. The study included an exploratory arm of male and female NHPs that were irradiated at a LD70-80/60 (n= 18/group) and received the same treatments. Result(s): Sargramostim decreased the mortality rate at Day 60 by 36% in the LD50-60/60group (p=0.0018) and by 44% in the LD70-80/60group (p=0.0076). Additionally, neutrophil, platelet, lymphocyte, and white blood cell levels in survivors demonstrated accelerated recovery in the sargramostim-treated NHPs in the LD50-60/60and LD70-80/60groups. Conclusion(s): Treatment with sargramostim (7 mug/kg/day) beginning at 48 h, in the absence of blood products and individualized antibiotics, suggests that the use of sargramostim is a viable therapeutic strategy for H-ARS in a mass casualty event.",Excluded
1452,"Diagnostic medical radiation in inflammatory bowel disease: Primum non-nocere? Background and Aims Patients with Inflammatory Bowel disease (IBD) are frequently exposed to diagnostic medical radiation for the diagnosis and evaluation of their disease. Despite increasing awareness of the potentially serious downstream effects, few studies have quantified radiation exposure in IBD patients. Methods We conducted a retrospective review of 225 consecutive patients attending IBD clinics at our hospital. Clinical data including demographics, disease characteristics and therapy were obtained from case note and electronic patient record review. All incidences of diagnostic medical radiation from initial diagnosis until 30 June 2010 inclusive were recorded from case note and computerised radiology database system review. The radiation dose for each procedure was obtained from published tables from the Royal College of Radiologists, UK. Effective dose for each procedure was calculated by multiplying this value by the number of procedures during the study period. The sum of doses received was the cumulative effective dose. Results One hundred and two of the 225 IBD patients reviewed were female, 123 were male. The median age was 48 (Range 17-88) and mean disease duration 9.8 years. One hundred and four patients had Crohn's disease, 113 patients had ulcerative colitis and 8 patients had an indeterminate colitis. The mean and median cumulative effective radiation doses were 11.35 mSv and 5.12 mSv respectively. A cumulative radiation dose greater than 10 mSv was seen in 40.9% (92) patients and greater than 25 mSv in 12.9% (29) patients. In 9 patients the cumulative effective dose was greater than 50 mSv. Crohn's disease was associated with a higher cumulative effective dose with exposure exceeding 10 mSv in 60.6%, 25 mSv in 22.1% and 50 mSv in 8.7% patients respectively. CT imaging accounted for 43% and barium studies for 32% of the total cumulative effective dose exposure. Thirty-nine patients had small bowel magnetic resonance (MR) studies as an alternative to ionising radiation in the last 3 years. Conclusions Patients with IBD, particularly those with Crohn's disease are exposed to significant amounts of diagnostic medical radiation in their lifetime. The increased risk of cancer from cumulative radiation coupled with the inherent risk of colorectal malignancy in long standing IBD and the potential for immunomodulator drugs such as azathioprine to increase the risk of cancers (e.g. lymphoma) is of great clinical and public health concern. Clinicians must remain vigilant to these risks when evaluating these patients and radiation exposure should be minimised and when possible alternatives such as intestinal ultrasound and MR imaging should be preferred.",Included
3033,"Effects of NKG2D haplotypes on the cell-surface expression of NKG2D protein on natural killer and CD8 T cells of peripheral blood among atomic-bomb survivors NKG2D is a primary activating receptor that triggers cell-mediated cytotoxicity in NK cells against tumor and virus-infected cells. We previously identified the NKG2D haplotypes in the natural killer gene complex region on chromosome 12p. Two major haplotype alleles, LNK1 and HNK1, were closely related to low and high natural cytotoxic activity phenotypes, respectively. Furthermore, the haplotype of HNK1/HNK1 has revealed a decreased risk of cancer compared with LNK1/LNK1. In the present study, using flow cytometry, we evaluated the functional effects of NKG2D haplotypes and five htSNPs in terms of the cell-surface expression of NKG2D protein on NK and CD8 T cells of peripheral blood among 732 atomic-bomb survivors. NKG2D expression on NK cells showed significant increases, in the order of LNK1/LNK1, LNK1/HNK1 and HNK1/HNK1 haplotypes (p for trend = 0.003), or with major homozygous, heterozygous, and minor homozygous genotypes for individual htSNPs (p for trend = 0.02-0.003). The same trend was observed for NKG2D expression on CD8 T cells. Our findings indicate that the NKG2D haplotypes are associated with the expression levels of NKG2D protein on NK and CD8 T cells, resulting in inter-individual variations in human cytotoxic response. © 2012 American Society for Histocompatibility and Immunogenetics.",Included

1756,"Time-dependence of the effect of X-irradiation on the formation of glycerol phosphate dehydrogenase and other dehydrogenases in the developing rat brain X-irradiation (100-1500 r) administered to the heads of rats 8-30 days of age inhibited the development of glycerol phosphate dehydrogenase (l-glycerol 3-phosphate-NAD oxidoreductase, EC 1.1.1.8) in the brain stem and cerebral hemispheres. At 40 days of age and older no effect was observed. This inhibition was a delayed phenomenon, dose-dependent and with no recovery. It is proposed that the inhibition of enzyme formation is related to radiation damage caused to DNA. Actinomycin D inhibited the development of glycerol phosphate dehydrogenase in a manner similar to ionizing radiation. Four other dehydrogenases also showed age-dependent radiosensitivities. ;Malic enzyme' (EC 1.1.1.40), lactate dehydrogenase (EC 1.1.1.27) and malate dehydrogenase (EC 1.1.1.37) ceased to be radiosensitive at about 8 days of age and isocitrate dehydrogenase (NADP) (EC 1.1.1.42) at 16 days. The correlation between developmental increase in enzyme activity and radiosensitivity held closely for glycerol phosphate dehydrogenase and isocitrate dehydrogenase and to a smaller extent for the others.",Included

Here, we investigate the spectral reflectance from this subcellular nanostructure and devise a new label-free technique based on a spectroscopic analysis of reflected light, enabling nanoscale imaging of myelinated axons in their natural living state. Using this technique, we demonstrate three-dimensional mapping of the axon diameter and sensing of dynamic changes in the substructure of myelin at nanoscale. We further reveal the prevalence of axon bulging in the brain cortex in vivo after mild compressive trauma. Our novel tool opens new avenues of investigation by creating unprecedented access to the nanostructural dynamics of live myelinated axons in health and disease.Copyright © 2017 The Author(s).",Excluded

Forty-three patients were examined at 100 kVp with filtered back projection after 60 mL of 370 mg I/mL contrast material was administered. Another 39 patients were examined at 80 kVp with IR after 30 mL of 270 mg I/mL contrast material was administered. Subjective and objective image quality was evaluated for each patient. Radiation doses were estimated and compared., RESULTS: Mean attenuation, noise and signal-to-noise ratio in 80 kVp group were significantly lower than in 100 kVp group (all P < 0.05), while there was no significant difference in contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR), although a trend towards a lower CNR in 80 kVp group was observed (P = 0.099). The subjective image quality between the two groups was not significantly different (P = 0.905).

228,"Adaptation to motion sickness from torso rotation affects symptoms from supine head nodding INTRODUCTION: Space motion sickness affects more than 50% of astronauts. Adaptation to one kind of nauseogenic motion can affect the response to another. We hypothesized that repeated exposure to torso rotation (TR) would diminish motion sickness (MS) due to supine head nodding (HN), a ground-based analogue for space sickness., METHODS: During TR, standing subjects swept their gaze back and forth between two targets located 135 degrees to either side of straight ahead. For HN, the subject lay supine on a platform with his/her head and neck hanging over the edge. The head was pitched back and forth between the horizontal position and rotated back as far as possible. MS was quantified in 5 male and 20 female subjects using numerical estimates of discomfort and a more detailed questionnaire. Susceptibility to TR and HN was determined on three occasions for each stimulus. At least 1 mo separated any two tests. Subjects were exposed to TR once a day for 7 consecutive days 1 mo after the final control session. Within 24 h of the seventh session, and 1 mo later, susceptibility to HN was evaluated again., RESULTS: There was a significant decrease in MS susceptibility during repeated exposure to TR (time to stop 17.7 min on Day 1, 31.8 min on Day 7). In contrast, there was a significant increase in MS susceptibility to HN after repeated exposure to TR (mean time to stop 11.7 min before TR, 9.5 min after). Susceptibility to HN was back to normal (time to stop 11.4 min) 1 mo later., DISCUSSION: Subjects can adapt to TR by repeated exposure. At the same time, susceptibility to HN increases. Strategies for pre-adaptation to space motion sickness need to be chosen carefully as they could actually be counterproductive.",Excluded

This paper reports the first analysis of the Semipalatinsk historical cohort exposed in the vicinity of the Semipalatinsk nuclear test site, Kazakhstan. The cohort study, which includes 19,545 inhabitants of exposed and comparison villages of the Semipalatinsk region, was set up in the 1960s and comprises 582,750 person-years of follow-up between 1960 and 1999. Cumulative effective radiation dose estimates in this cohort range from 20 mSv to approximately 4 Sv. Rates of mortality and cancer mortality in the exposed group substantially exceeded those of the comparison group. Dose-response analyses within the exposed group confirmed a significant trend with dose for all solid cancers (P < 0.0001) and for digestive and respiratory cancers (P = 0.0255 and P < 0.0001), whereas no consistent dose-response trend was found for all causes of death (P = 0.4296). Regarding specific cancer sites, a significant trend with dose was observed for lung cancer (P = 0.0001), stomach cancer (P = 0.0050), and female breast cancer (P = 0.0040) as well as for esophagus cancer in women (P = 0.0030). The excess relative risk per sievert for all solid cancers combined was 1.77 (1.35; 2.27) based on the total cohort data, yet a selection bias regarding the comparison group could not be entirely ruled out. The excess relative risk per sievert based on the cohort's exposed group was 0.81 (0.46; 1.33) for all solid cancers combined and thus still exceeds current risk estimates from the Life Span Study. Future epidemiological assessments based on this cohort will benefit from extension of follow-up and ongoing validation of dosimetric data.",Included

Coronary artery segments were assessed for image quality and significant luminal diameter narrowing. Sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive values (PPV), negative predictive values (NPV), and accuracy of both CTCA groups were determined using conventional catheter angiography (CCA) as reference standard. Radiation dose values were calculated., RESULTS: Both groups were comparable regarding gender, body weight, cardiovascular risk profile, severity of CAD, mean heart rate, heart rate variability, and Agatston score (all p>0.05). There was no significant difference in the rate of non-assessable coronary segments between group 1 (1.6%, 24/1404) and group 2 (1.4%, 19/1385; p=0.77); non-diagnostic image quality was significantly (p<0.001) more often attributed to stair step artifacts in group 1. Segment-based sensitivity, specificity, PPV, NPV, and accuracy were 98%, 98%, 88%, 100%, and 100% among group 1; 96%, 99%, 90%, 100%, and 98% among group 2, respectively. Parameters of diagnostic performance were similar (all p>0.05). Mean effective radiation dose of prospectively ECG-gated CTCA (2.2+/-0.4 mSv) was significantly (p<0.0001) smaller than that of retrospectively ECG-gated CTCA (8.1+/-0.6 mSv)., CONCLUSION: Prospectively ECG-gated CTCA yields similar image quality, performs as accurately as retrospectively ECG-gated CTCA in patients having heart rates <=70 bpm while being associated with a lower mean effective radiation dose.

Method(s): We conducted a prospective, observational study at an urban county trauma center of adults who presented to the ED for evaluation of suspected SSTI. ED providers measured area of erythema and induration using a tape measure, and completed data sheets indicating comorbid conditions and the presence or absence of physical exam findings. Fever was defined as any recorded temperature > 38degreeC during the first six hours of ED evaluation. Result(s): Of the 734 patients enrolled, 96 (13.1%) had fever. Physical and laboratory exam findings associated with the presence of a fever in multivariable logistic regression were the area of erythema, particularly the largest quartile of area of erythema, 144-5,000 cm2, (odd ratio [OR] = 2.9; 95% confidence interval [CI] [1.6-5.2]) and leukocytosis (OR = 4.4, 95% CI [2.7-7.0]). Bullae, necrosis, streaks, adenopathy, and bone involvement on imaging were not associated with fever.

Aortic annulus area (AAA) was planimetrically quantified on both datasets. While only one moment of cardiac cycle was available for measurements in the high-pitch CT, the point of time in the multiphasic CT was chosen, where AAA yielded maximum size. Hypothetical prosthesis sizing was compared between multiphasic vs. high-pitch CT. Result(s): Among 61 patients (44.2 % men, mean age: 83.3 +/- 5.5 years) average heart rate and HRV were 71.0 +/- 13.4 bpm and 7.3 +/- 8.5 bpm. 20 patients (32.7 %) had atrial fibrillation at the time of image acquisition. There was a strong correlation of AAA as derived from multiphasic vs. the high-pitch CT (r = 0.98). The difference in AAA was 10.5 +/- 17.1mm2 (455.1 +/- 83.0 mm2 for multiphasic vs. 444.5 +/- 87.2 mm2 for high-pitch CT) and did not reach statistical significance (p = 0.08). Hypothetical prosthesis sizing showed an agreement in 55 of 61 patients (90.2 %). A sizing based on the high-pitch CT resulted in smaller prosthesis choice in 6 patients, all of them suffering from atrial fibrillation. Mean effective radiation dose was 10.9 +/- 6.1 mSv for cardiac CTA and 4.1 +/- 1.0 mSv for high-pitch CTA. Conclusion(s): For patients with sinus rhythm, systolic high-pitch aortoiliac CTA provides adequate prosthesis size selection as compared with multiphasic ECG-gated cardiac CTA and may result in significantly reduced radiation exposition.Copyright © 2020 Elsevier B.V.",Excluded
3375,"Cyberknife treatment for advanced or terminal stage hepatocellular carcinoma AIM: To investigate the safety and efficacy of the Cyberknife treatment for patients with advanced or terminal stage hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC)., METHODS: Patients with HCC with extrahepatic metastasis or vascular or bile duct invasion were enrolled between May 2011 and June 2015. The Cyberknife was used to treat each lesion. Treatment response scores were based on Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors v1.1. The trends of tumor markers, including alpha fetoprotein (AFP) and proteins induced by vitamin K absence II (PIVKA II) were assessed. Prognostic factors for tumor response and tumor markers were evaluated with Fisher's exact test and a logistic regression model. Survival was evaluated with the Kaplan-Meier method and multivariate analysis was performed using the Cox proportional hazards model., RESULTS: Sixty-five patients with 95 lesions were enrolled. Based on the Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer classification, all patients were either in the advanced or terminal stage of the disease. The target lesions were as follows: 52 were bone metastasis; 9, lung metastasis; 7, brain metastasis; 9, portal vein invasion; 4, hepatic vein invasion; 4, bile duct invasion; and 10 other lesion types. The response rate and disease control rate were 34% and 53%, respectively. None of the clinical factors correlated significantly with tumor response. Fiducial marker implantation was associated with better control of both AFP (HR = 0.152; 95%CI: 0.026-0.887; P = 0.036) and PIVKA II (HR = 0.035; 95%CI: 0.003-0.342; P = 0.004). The median survival time was 9 mo (95%CI: 5-15 mo). Terminal stage disease (HR = 9.809; 95%CI: 2.589-37.17, P < 0.001) and an AFP of more than 400 ng/mL (HR = 2.548; 95%CI: 1.070-6.068, P = 0.035) were associated with worse survival. A radiation dose higher than 30 Gy (HR = 0.274; 95%CI: 0.093-0.7541, P = 0.012) was associated with better survival. In the 52 cases of bone metastasis, 36 patients (69%) achieved pain relief. One patient had cerebral bleeding and another patient had an esophageal ulcer after treatment., CONCLUSION: The Cyberknife can be safely administered to patients with advanced or terminal stage HCC. High AFP levels were associated with worse survival, but a higher radiation dose improved the survival.",Excluded
657,"Limiting values for the RBE of fission neutrons at low doses for life shortening in mice We have analyzed recently published data on the effects of low doses of fission neutrons on the mean survival times of mice. The analysis for single-dose exposures was confined to doses of 20 rad or less, while for fractionated exposures only total doses of 80 rad or less were considered. We fitted the data to the frequently used power function model: life shortening = beta D lambda, where D is the radiation dose. We show that, at low doses per fraction, either (1) the effects are not additive or (2) the dose-effect curve for single exposures cannot show a greater negative curvature than about the 0.9 power of dose. Analysis of the data for gamma rays showed that an exponent of 1.0 gave an acceptable fit. Taken together, these findings indicate that the RBE for neutrons cannot change more rapidly with neutron dose than about RBEN approximately = k/D0.1N. This conflicts with the more widely accepted relationship, RBEN approximately = k/D0.5N. Because of the inherent implausibility of exponents less than 1.0 for the neutron dose-effect curves at low doses we conclude that at neutron doses of 20 rad or less the RBE for life shortening is constant and ranges from 13 to 22 depending on mouse strain and sex.",Included
3054,"Identification of a novel mutation in ATP13A2 associated with a complicated form of hereditary spastic paraplegia Objective To establish molecular diagnosis for a family with a complicated form of autosomal recessive hereditary spastic paraplegia with intellectual disability, cognitive decline, psychosis, peripheral neuropathy, upward gaze palsy, and thin corpus callosum (TCC). Methods Physical examinations, laboratory tests, structural neuroimaging studies, and exome sequence analysis were carried out. Results The 3 patients exhibited intellectual disability and progressive intellectual decline accompanied by psychiatric symptoms. Gait difficulty with spasticity and pyramidal weakness appeared at the ages of 20s-30s. Brain MRI revealed TCC with atrophic changes in the frontotemporal lobes, caudate nuclei, and cerebellum. Exome sequence analysis revealed a novel homozygous c.2654C>A (p. Ala885Asp) variant in the ATP13A2, a gene responsible for a complicated form of hereditary spastic paraplegia (SPG78), Kufor-Rakeb syndrome, and neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis. The predominant clinical presentations of the patients include progressive intellectual disability and gait difficulty with spasticity and pyramidal weakness, consistent with the diagnosis of SPG78. Of note, prominent psychiatric symptoms and extrapyramidal signs including rigidity, dystonia, and involuntary movements preceded the spastic paraparesis.

A split course of pre- and postoperative hyperfractionated radiation therapy and concurrent chemotherapy was used in an effort to limit perioperative mortality. METHOD(S): Eligibility required a diagnosis of esophageal or gastroesophageal junction cancer and an esophageal ultrasound stage of at least T3, N1, or M1A. Patients received a 12-day induction course of radiation (1.5 Gy twice a dose to a dose of 30 Gy) concurrent with 4-day continuous intravenous infusions of cisplatin (20 mg/m per day) and 5-fluorouracil (1000 mg/m per day) beginning on day 1. Surgery followed in 4 to 6 weeks followed 6 to 10 weeks later by a second, identical course of chemoradiotherapy. RESULT(S): From October 1999 through March 2003, 93 patients were enrolled; 96% were white, 86% male, and 83% had adenocarcinoma. Resection was possible in 83 patients (89%) with 4 (5%) perioperative deaths. With a median follow up of 50 months (range, 34-72 months), the 3-year projected overall survival rate is 27.9%, freedom from recurrence 30.5%, and distant metastatic control 32.4%. Locoregional control in resected patients is 86%. Freedom from recurrence and distant control were significantly better in patients with 1) earlier pretreatment clinical stage, 2) earlier postinduction pathologic stage, 3) squamous cell cancer, and 4) a pathologic response. CONCLUSION(S): This accelerated multimodality treatment program is feasible and perioperative mortality proved acceptable. Despite excellent locoregional control, freedom from recurrence, and overall survival proved disappointing reflecting the frequency of distant metastases. Heterogeneity in patient populations makes comparisons with similar nonrandomized experiences problematic. © 2007 Lippincott Williams & Wilkins, Inc.",Excluded
840,"Concomitant radiochemotherapy for locally advanced oro- and hypopharyngeal cancer: tolerance and early results Combination of radio- and chemotherapy is one of the methods which may improve results of treatment in patients with locally advanced head and neck cancer. Currently, the most promising sequence of radio- and chemotherapy is concomitant. In Head and Neck Cancer Department of Cancer Center in Warsaw since 1995 is continued study estimated tolerance and effectiveness of the concomitant radiochemotherapy for patients with locally advanced oro- and hypopharyngeal cancer. Chemotherapy consist of cisplatinum and 5-fluorouracil in continuous infusion during first week of irradiation followed by 24-hours infusion of 5-fluorouracil one weekly until radiotherapy is finished. Radiotherapy is used with conventional fractionation 2 Gy per fraction, 5 fractions weekly to total dose 66 Gy. Between October 1995 and September 1998 fifty seven patients with oropharyngeal cancer were entered to study. Tolerance of treatment was acceptable. Complete regression of the tumor was obtained in 41/57 patients (72%). Five other patients after radiotherapy were referred for successful radical neck dissection. Including this group, local control was obtained in 81%. At this moment, 60% of patients are alive without evidence of disease. In 12 patients with hypopharyngeal cancer tolerance of treatment and early results were poor, so the study was stopped in this group.",Excluded

2517,"High-dose-rate brachytherapy for non-small-cell lung carcinoma: A retrospective study of 226 patients Purpose: To evaluate the efficacy and toxicity of high-dose-rate (HDR) brachytherapy in patients with inoperable endobronchial carcinoma. Methods and Materials: We retrospectively reviewed the records (April 1991 - May 2004) of patients with non-small-cell carcinoma, with no extrabronchial spread on computed tomography scans, who underwent HDR brachytherapy because of contraindications to surgery and external beam radiation therapy. Kaplan-Meier survival curves were compared by the log-rank test. Prognostic factors were analyzed by multivariate analysis. Result(s): 226 patients (223 men, 3 women, mean age: 62.2 years (range, 40-84)) were included. Of those, 217 (97%) had squamous cell carcinoma (Tis/T1/T2/Tx: 60/153/9/4). Dose was prescribed at 1 cm from the radius (24-35 Gy in 4-6 fractions). Mean follow-up was 30.4 months (range, 9-116). Complete endoscopic response rate was 93.6% at 3 months. One hundred twenty-eight patients (56%) died of intercurrent disease (n = 45), local failure (n = 36), metastasis (n = 10), local failure and metastasis (n = 11), complications (n = 13), and other causes (n = 12). The 2-year and 5-year survival rates were, respectively, 57% and 29% (overall) (median, 28.6 months), 81% and 56% (cancer-specific), and 68% and 50% (local disease-free). Acute toxicity included pneumothorax (1.5%) and mucosal inflammation (10%). Late complications were hemoptysis (6.6% with 5% of fatalities), bronchitis (19.5%), and necrosis (3.5%). In multivariate analysis, a distal tumor location and the use of two catheters were associated with improved local disease-free survival (p = 0.003 and p = 0.007, respectively) and a distal tumor location with improved overall survival (p = 0.0001). Conclusion(s): This large retrospective study confirms that HDR brachytherapy is an efficient and safe treatment in patients with inoperable endobronchial carcinoma.

2934,"Effect of extracellular pH on GABA-activated current in rat recombinant receptors and thin hypothalamic slices We studied the effects of extracellular pH (pHo) on gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)-mediated Cl- current in rat hypothalamic neurons and recombinant type-A GABA (GABA(A)) receptors stably expressed in human embryonic kidney cells (HEK 293), using whole cell and outside-out patch-clamp recordings. In alpha3beta2gamma2s receptors, acidic pH decreased, whereas alkaline pH increased the response to GABA in a reversible and concentration-dependent manner. Acidification shifted the GABA concentration-response curve to the right, significantly increasing the EC50 for GABA without appreciably changing the slope or maximal current induced by GABA. We obtained similar effects of pH in alpha1beta2gamma2 receptors and in GABA-activated currents recorded from thin hypothalamic brain slices. In outside-out patches recorded from alpha3beta2gamma2 recombinant receptors, membrane patches were exposed to 5 microM GABA at control (7.3), acidic (6.4), or alkaline (8.4) pH. GABA activated main and subconductance states of 24 and 16 pS, respectively, in alpha3beta2gamma2 receptors. Alkaline pH(o) increased channel opening frequency and decreased the duration of the long closed state, resulting in an increase in open probability (from 0.0801 +/- 0.015 in pH 7.3 to 0.138 +/- 0.02 in pH 8.4). Exposure of the channels to acidic pH(o) had the opposite effects on open probability (decreased to 0.006 +/- 0.0001). Taken together, our results indicate that the function of GABA(A) receptors is modulated by extracellular pH. The proton effect is similar in recombinant and native receptors and is dependent on GABA concentration. In addition, the effect appears to be independent of the alpha-subunit isoform, and is due to the ability of H+ to alter the frequency of channel opening. Our findings indicate that GABAergic signaling in the CNS may be significantly altered during conditions that increase or decrease pH.",Excluded
3459,"Indirect measurement of mitochondrial proton leak and its application In mitochondria, ATP synthesis is coupled to oxygen consumption by the proton electrochemical gradient established across the mitochondrial inner membrane in a process termed oxidative phosphorylation. It has long been known from stoichiometric studies that ATP synthesis is not perfectly coupled to oxygen consumption. The major inefficiency in the system is leakage of protons across the mitochondrial inner membrane driven by the proton electrochemical gradient. The kinetics of the proton leak can be determined indirectly, by measuring the oxygen consumption of mitochondria under non-phosphorylating conditions (plus oligomycin) as a function of the proton electrochemical gradient. This experimental system provides a convenient means to investigate inner membrane permeability to protons and the effect of factors that may effect that permeability. In this paper we review some results from our laboratory of indirect measurement of mitochondrial proton leak and how it has been applied to investigate the effect of aging, obesity and thyroid status on proton leak. The results show that (i) proton leak in isolated liver mitochondria is not significantly different in a comparison of young and old rats, in contrast (ii) there is an apparent increase in proton leak in in situ mitochondria in hepatocytes from old rats when compared to those from young rats, (iii) proton leak in neuronal mitochondria in situ in synaptosomes is not significantly different in young and old rats, (iv) proton leak is greater in isolated liver mitochondria from ob/ob mice compared to lean controls, (v) acute leptin (OB protein) administration restores the increased leak rate in isolated liver mitochondria from ob/ob mice to that of lean controls, (vi) administration of thyroid hormone (T3) increases proton leak in rat muscle mitochondria, and (vii) proton leak in muscle mitochondria is insensitive to the presence of GDP. It is proposed that the experimental system described here for measuring proton leak, is an ideal functional assay for determining whether the novel uncoupling proteins increase inner membrane permeability to protons.",Excluded
1050,"Surgeon volume and adequacy of thyroidectomy for differentiated thyroid cancer Introduction. We aimed to determine influence of surgeon volume on (1) frequency of appropriate initial surgery for differentiated thyroid cancer (DTC) and (2) completeness of resection. Methods. We reviewed all initial thyroidectomies (Tx; lobectomy and total) performed in a health system during 2011; surgeons were grouped by number of Tx cases per year. For patients with histologic DTC >=1 cm, surgeon volume was correlated with initial extent of the operation, and markers of complete resection including uptake on I123 prescan, thyrotropin-stimulated thyroglobulin levels, and I131 dose administered. Results. Of 1,249 patients who underwent Tx by 42 surgeons, 29% had DTC >=1 cm without distant metastasis. At a threshold of >=30 Tx per year, surgeons were more likely to perform initial total Tx for DTC >=1 cm (P = .01), and initial resection was more complete as measured by all 3 quantitative markers. For patients with advanced stage disease, a threshold of >=50 Tx per year was needed before observing improvements in I123 uptake (P = .004). Conclusion. Surgeons who perform >=30 Tx a year are more likely to undertake the appropriate initial operation and have more complete initial resection for DTC patients. Surgeon volume is an essential consideration in optimizing outcomes for DTC patients, and even higher thresholds (>=50 Tx/year) may be necessary for patients with advanced disease.Copyright © 2014 Elsevier Inc.",Excluded

Cases series: Case 1: a 67-year-old man was hit by 200 pellets in the posterior head, right shoulder and arm. Due to a severe oedema of the arm, a fasciotomy was performed. During the following year the patient remained asymptomatic; blood and urine lead levels, collected every 3 months, resulted 4, 14, 13, 7 mcg/dL (n.v. 0.1-10 mcg/dL) and 19.4, 16.2, 55.6 mcg/L (n.v. 0.5-3.5 mcg/L). Case 2: a 43-year-old man was accidentally hit by 150pellets in the right leg. The patient required emergency surgery; during the following year blood lead levels ranged from 21.7 to 29.7 mcg/dL; the urine lead levels progressively decrease from 17.8 to 2.7 mcg/L. Either in case 1 and 2 red cell zinc-protoporphyrin, urine aminolevulinic-acid and blood film resulted always normal. Case 3: after accidental inoculation of thermometer's mercury a 31- years woman presented local oedema and numerous radio-opaque micro-droplets at the second proximal phalanx of the left hand. After a surgical toilet X-ray showed a diffused foreign material over the second metacarpal joint. During a three years follow-up the patient remained asymptomatic; no biochemical alterations neither modification on radio-opaque material distribution were registered.

The primary objective of the GRETA cohort study was to compare the overall survival (OS) of patients with mCRC treated with first-line B+CT versus chemotherapy (CT) alone, in an Italian clinical practice setting. Material(s) and Method(s): Incident patients with mCRC were identified during the period 2010-2012 from five population-based cancer registries in Italy. Cases were linked to regional health care utilization databases to obtain the entire spectrum of health services provided to each patient. Patients starting a first-line treatment with B+CT or CT alone within 90 days from the diagnosis were included in the study cohort. A propensity score (PS) method was applied to account for residual confounding. Result(s): Of 480 patients with mCRC included in the study cohort, 21.0 received first-line B+CT, and 79.0% received CT. Patients receiving B+CT were younger (p <.001) and underwent surgery more frequently (p =.001). The median OS was 22.5 and 14.6 months for B+CT and CT, respectively (p =.011). The corresponding hazard ratios adjusted by multivariate modeling and PS matched analysis were 0.82 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.62-1.08) and 0.86 (95% CI, 0.56-1.33), respectively. Similar results were observed after subgrouping by age and surgery. Conclusion(s): In this Italian real-world setting of unselected mCRC, the OS of patients treated with B+CT was consistent with previous observational and patient-registry studies. However, definitive evidence of an improvement in OS cannot be drawn. Implications for Practice: Bevacizumab is a well-established first-line treatment for metastatic colorectal cancer. However, there is scarce evidence in the literature about its effectiveness in clinical practice. Evaluating this topic should be of interest for both clinicians and regulatory agencies. In this study, the median overall survival of the bevacizumab cohort was strikingly coherent with that reported in large observational series of unselected patients, thus suggesting a consistent and reproducible effect of the drug in clinical practice. Although consistent results were observed both in the overall population and in age and surgery subgroups, the present study did not offer definitive evidence of an improvement in OS.Copyright © AlphaMed Press 2018",Excluded

678,"An open-label, prospective pilot clinical study of denosumab for severe hyperparathyroidism in patients with low bone mass undergoing dialysis CONTEXT: Denosumab is widely used for bone diseases with increased bone resorption. Its effectiveness in patients with severe secondary hyperparathyroidism on dialysis is unclear.
OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of denosumab in patients with severe secondary hyperparathyroidism who are on dialysis.
DESIGN: This 6-month prospective, open-labeled study evaluated 12 patients (five women, seven men; mean age 53.5 ± 3.8 y). All had intact PTH (iPTH; > 1000 pg/mL), low bone mass (T-score < -1.0 SD), and bone pain and were poor surgical candidates. Serum calcium, phosphorus, alkaline phosphatase (AP), and iPTH levels were assessed at baseline and every month thereafter. Vertebral spine x-rays and bone mineral densities (BMDs) (lumbar spine and femoral neck) were assessed at the start and end of the study. All patients received denosumab (60 mg), calcitriol, phosphate binders, and dialysate calcium that were adjusted according to the biochemistry data.
RESULTS: The BMD increased in both the femoral neck (mean increase 23.7% ± 4.0%) and lumbar spine (17.1% ± 2.6%) after 6 months. In the first month, most patients had increased iPTH levels, which dramatically decreased from 1702.1 ± 181.9 to 518.8 ± 126.8 pg/mL by the end of the study after increasing the calcitriol dose. All patients had significant decreases in AP, calcium × phosphorus, and bone pain. Changes in femoral neck BMD correlated only with AP and iPTH levels.
CONCLUSIONS: Denosumab is effective in restoring bone mass and reducing bone pain in patients on dialysis with secondary hyperparathyroidism. It also allows for a more aggressive use of calcitriol to control hyperparathyroidism.",Excluded
3270,"The first evidence for SLFN11 expression as an independent prognostic factor for patients with esophageal cancer after chemoradiotherapy Background: Schlafen 11 (SLFN11) was recently identified as a dominant determinant of sensitivity to DNA-targeting agents including platinum-based drugs. SLFN11 also reportedly enhances cellular radiosensitivity. In this study, we examined the prognostic value of SLFN11 expression in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) patients treated with definitive chemoradiotherapy (dCRT), including the platinum derivative nedaplatin. Method(s): Seventy-three patients with ESCC who received dCRT were examined. SLFN11 expression was analyzed in pre-dCRT biopsies using immunohistochemistry and evaluated using a histo-score (H-score). Correlation between the H-score and overall survival was analyzed. An H-score >= 51 was provisionally defined as indicating high SLFN11 expression. Viability assays were performed using previously established isogenic human cell lines differentially expressing SLFN11 to test the usefulness of SLFN11 as marker of response to the dCRT regimen. Result(s): High SLFN11 expression was independently associated with better prognosis in ESCC patients (hazard ratio = 0.295, 95% CI = 0.143-0.605, p = 0.001 for multivariate analysis). Kaplan-Meier survival curves showed that the prognostic value of high SLFN11 expression was most evident in patients at clinical stages II and III (p = 0.004). In in vitro study, SLFN11-proficient cells were highly sensitive to platinum derivatives compared to SLFN11-deficient cells. Conclusion(s): SLFN11 expression is an independent prognostic factor for ESCC patients treated with dCRT and a potential biomarker for treatment selection of ESCC. Examination of SLFN11 may be particularly useful for clinical Stage II-III patients who wish to choose dCRT (instead of surgery) to preserve esophageal function.Copyright © 2020, The Author(s).",Excluded
1995,"Risk of cancer associated with low-dose radiation exposure: comparison of results between the INWORKS nuclear workers study and the A-bomb survivors study The Life Span Study (LSS) of Japanese atomic bomb survivors has served as the primary basis for estimates of radiation-related disease risks that inform radiation protection standards. The long-term follow-up of radiation-monitored nuclear workers provides estimates of radiation-cancer associations that complement findings from the LSS. Here, a comparison of radiation-cancer mortality risk estimates derived from the LSS and INWORKS, a large international nuclear worker study, is presented. Restrictions were made, so that the two study populations were similar with respect to ages and periods of exposure, leading to selection of 45,625 A-bomb survivors and 259,350 nuclear workers. For solid cancer, excess relative rates (ERR) per gray (Gy) were 0.28 (90% CI 0.18; 0.38) in the LSS, and 0.29 (90% CI 0.07; 0.53) in INWORKS. A joint analysis of the data allowed for a formal assessment of heterogeneity of the ERR per Gy across the two studies (P=0.909), with minimal evidence of curvature or of a modifying effect of attained age, age at exposure, or sex in either study. There was evidence in both cohorts of modification of the excess absolute risk (EAR) of solid cancer by attained age, with a trend of increasing EAR per Gy with attained age. For leukemia, under a simple linear model, the ERR per Gy was 2.75 (90% CI 1.73; 4.21) in the LSS and 3.15 (90% CI 1.12; 5.72) in INWORKS, with evidence of curvature in the association across the range of dose observed in the LSS but not in INWORKS; the EAR per Gy was 3.54 (90% CI 2.30; 5.05) in the LSS and 2.03 (90% CI 0.36; 4.07) in INWORKS.

3057,"Use of 120 kilovolt tube potential for digital subtraction angiography and fluoroscopy in an image-intensifier angiographic system: Decrease of skin dose in transarterial chemoembolization therapy for hepatocellular carcinoma In an image-intensifier angiographic system, the tube potential is commonly regulated in ranges from 75 to 90 kV for digital subtraction angiography (DSA) and fluoroscopy in transarterial chemoembolization therapy (TACE) for hepatocellular carcinoma. The purpose of this study was to investigate whether or not a 120-kV tube potential could be used for DSA and fluoroscopy in TACE to decrease the skin dose. Forty-three patients administered TACE were randomly allocated into two groups: TACE was performed using standard-kilovoltage (75- to 90-kV) DSA and fluoroscopy modes (group A; n = 20) or using high-kilovoltage (120-kV) modes (group B; n = 23). The peak skin dose was compared between the groups. One case in group A was excluded from the study because the HCC nodule was not depicted on DSA. The peak skin dose (mGy) for group A was 383.6 +/- 176.5 and that for group B was 265.1 +/- 145.1. The peak skin dose was decreased by 31% in the 120-kV mode, a statistically significant difference (t-test, p = 0.022). We conclude that the use of 120 kV tube potential for DSA and fluoroscopy may be one option for performing TACE while decreasing the skin dose. © 2007 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.",Excluded
1254,"Ability of a chest X-ray and an abdominal computed tomography scan to identify traumatic thoracic injury OBJECTIVE: Our objective was to show that a chest X-ray (CXR) and an abdominal computed tomography (CT) scan are sufficient to identify most clinically significant thoracic injuries in trauma patients, rendering the thoracic CT scan useful in only a subset of patients., METHODS: A retrospective study identified thoracic injuries in 374 trauma patients evaluated with a CXR, a thoracic CT scan, and an abdominal CT scan. Injuries seen on the initial CXR versus those seen on a CT scan only (occult) were identified and assessed for clinical relevance., RESULTS: An abdominal CT scan identified 65% (15/23) of occult pneumothoraces, 100% (25/25) of occult hemothoraces, 64% (18/28) of occult pulmonary contusions, and 58% (18/31) of occult rib fractures. No occult pneumothoraces seen on the thoracic CT scan alone required tube thoracostomy., CONCLUSIONS: Our pilot study suggests that a CXR and an abdominal CT scan will identify most occult intrathoracic injuries. Reserving a thoracic CT scan for patients with an abnormal CXR or high-risk mechanism could safely reduce cost and radiation exposure while still diagnosing significant thoracic injuries.

3240,"Chemoradiotherapy and Increased Prescription Dose in Esophageal Squamous Cell Cancer: A Retrospective Study To analyze the outcomes and adverse events of patients with esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) treated with definitive chemoradiation with modified radiotherapy volume and increased radiation dose. This was a retrospective analysis of patients with ESCC treated with definitive chemoradiotherapy at the Sun Yat-sen University Cancer Center (02/2015 to 02/2017). The dose to the planning gross tumor volume (PGTV) and planning clinical tumor volume (PTV1) was 66-68 Gy (2.0-2.2 Gy/fraction). The dose to the planning regional lymph node drainage area volume (PTV2) was 46 Gy (2.0 Gy/fraction). Treatment response, adverse events, progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS), and locoregional failure-free survival (LRFFS) were analyzed. Twenty-six patients were included. The median follow-up was 31 (range, 4.3-51.3) months. Sixteen (61.5%) patients had a complete response, and four (15.4%) achieved a partial response. The objective response rate was 76.9%, and the disease control rate was 80.8%. The median PFS and OS were not achieved. The 4-year PFS was 63.9%, and the 4-year OS was 71.0%. Grade 1-2 and 3-4 radiation-related esophagitis was observed in 15 (57.7%) and one (4.5%) patients, respectively. Grade 1-2 and 3-4 radiation-related pneumonitis was observed in 12 (46.2%) and one (4.5%) patients, respectively. No patients developed radiation-related heart or skin damage. The modified target volume definition and increased dose of definitive radiotherapy combined with chemotherapy in patients with ESCC had low toxicity and might improve survival, but additional trials are necessary to prove the superiority of this strategy.Copyright © 2021 Xiaofen Pan et al.",Excluded
3675,"The use of intraoperative neuroimaging tools and a navigation system in surgical treatment of primary and metastatic tumors of the spine INTRODUCTION: Surgical treatment of spinal tumors is associated with a high risk of intraoperative complications, including injury to the spinal cord, its roots, and large vessels both during tumor resection and at the stabilization stage during implantation of pedicular or corporal screws. The use of intraoperative neuroimaging tools and a navigation system in surgical treatment of oncological diseases of the spine enables identifying the location and extension of a tumor lesion directly in the operating room, which provides control of the resection area and the possibility of the spine stabilization under disturbed anatomy conditions when bone density is altered by the osteolytic process or systemic changes. Also, the risk of injury to the major blood vessels is reduced., MATERIAL AND METHODS: Surgical treatment of 156 patients with primary and metastatic tumors of the spine was performed at the Burdenko Neurosurgical Institute in the period from 2002 to December 2014. Twelve patients underwent diagnostic intervention (transcutaneous biopsy), and 35 patients underwent surgery using intraoperative CT and a navigation systems. The indication for biopsy using both CT and the navigation system was the presence of a spinal tumor not verified by a pathomorphological examination. An O-arm intraoperative computed tomography scanner and a Medtronic's StealthStation S7 Navigation System were used in all cases., CONCLUSION: The use of both CT and the navigation system provides high quality treatment and significantly reduces radiation exposure to the medical personnel and patient. The possibility of intraoperative identification of the location and extension of a tumor in bone tissue facilitates adequate tumor resection within the intact surgical margin, with the surrounding vessels and neurological structures being under real-time control.",Excluded
344,"Radiation-induced and transposon-induced chromosome damage in Drosophila: translocations and transmission distortion The possible interaction between X-ray- and transposon-induced chromosome damage was monitored in the P-M system of hybrid dysgenesis in Drosophila melanogaster. One- to two-day-old F1 dysgenic males originating from a cross between M strain females and P strain males were irradiated with 5.5 Gy (550 rad) or used as controls to monitor X-Y translocations and transmission ratio distortion. Two 3-day sperm broods were sampled for the former and two 4-day broods for the latter to detect damage induced in the most radiosensitive cells. F1 nondysgenic males derived from M female to M male crosses (controls) were treated identically. X-Y chromosome translocations induced by P element mobility alone declined sharply with a decrease in temperature (18 versus 21 degrees C) and they were significantly reduced with aging of hybrid males from brood 2, 4-8 days of age, to brood 3, 7-11 days of age. No significant increase in translocations was observed when X irradiation and P-M dysgenesis were combined, showing no interaction between damages induced by the two mutator systems. In contrast, interaction was observed in transmission ratio distortion which was significantly increased by X irradiation of hybrid males derived from both reciprocal M X P and P x M crosses. The preferential elimination of P element-bearing autosomes occurred when either spermatocytes or spermatids were irradiated. An aging effect was also observed, resulting in less distortion in 9- to 14-day-old dysgenic males compared to 5- to 10-day-old hybrids.",Included

1419,"An investigation into the effect of electrode placement of transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) on experimentally induced ischemic pain in healthy human participants INTRODUCTION: It is claimed that transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) operates via a segmental mechanism by reducing ongoing transmission and sensitization of nociceptive dorsal horn neurons. Hence, TENS electrodes are usually placed at the site of pain., OBJECTIVE: This study compared TENS administered at the site of experimentally induced ischemic pain (ipsilateral forearm) with TENS administered at a location not related to pain (contralateral lower leg)., METHODS: Ten healthy, pain free volunteers took part in a cross-over study during which ischemic pain was induced in the nondominant arm using a modified version of submaximal effort tourniquet technique. Pain intensity was taken at 1-minute interval/s for 5 minutes while receiving TENS either at the ipsilateral arm or contralateral leg., RESULTS: There were no statistically significant differences in pain intensity or McGill Pain Questionnaire ratings between TENS given at the arm compared with the leg., DISCUSSION: Taken at face value, the findings suggest that TENS effects were nonspecific and that electrode location does not affect outcome. However, this study should be seen as a call for further research rather than a definitive conclusion.",Excluded
2601,"Delayed non-myeloablative irradiation after lung transplantation to induce allograft acceptance in a large animal model Purpose: Previously, we induced long term tolerance in animals that underwent perioperative irradiation and a donor-specific alloantigen infusion in our miniature swine lung transplantation model. Here, we delayed induction to improve its clinical applicability. Method(s): Left sided single lung transplantation from MHC mismatched male donors was performed in 11 female outbred minipigs. Group 1 (n= 5) received non-myeloablative irradiation (7 Gy thymus and 1,5 Gy whole body, IRR) 12 hours before transplantation and perioperative donor-specific splenocyte infusion (SpTx). Group 2 (n= 3) also received a perioperative SpTx, but underwent delayed irradiation 3 days after transplantation. Group 3 (n= 3) was also exposed to delayed IRR but did not receive a donor-specific SpTx. Immunosuppression was maintained for 28 days with tacrolimus and methylprednisolone. Peripheral blood chimerism was monitored by flow cytometry and real-time polymerase chain reaction. Result(s): In group 1, three animals never rejected their grafts until elective sacrifice at postoperative days (POD) 800+, the other two showed rejection on POD 239 and 360. In group 2, median allograft survival was 92 days. Out of the third group, one animal showed rejection on POD 226, the other two are currently alive at POD 216 and 393. In all groups, chimerism was detectable 1 hour after reperfusion of the lung, and peaked 1 hour after SpTx in groups 1 and 2. Group 1 showed early leukocyte chimerism levels of up to 30%. Analysis of putative regulatory CD4+CD25 high T cells revealed a rising tendency in group 1, whereas groups 2 and 3 had decreasing levels of this T cell subpopulation after withdrawal of immunosuppression. Conclusion(s): Preoperative irradiation and perioperative SpTx had the potential to upregulate the frequency of putative regulatory CD4+CD25 high T cells. SpTx without preceding IRR seemed to rather upregulate the effector arm, than inducing Treg proliferation. Delayed IRR only may lead to prolonged allograft survival in all three animals. This unresponsiveness might be due to induced anergy.",Excluded
3321,"Effect of low dose-rate prostate brachytherapy on the sexual health of men with optimal sexual function before treatment: Analysis at >=7 years of follow-up OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effect of low-dose rate prostate brachytherapy on the sexual health of men with >=7 years of prospective evaluation and optimum sexual function before treatment. PATIENTS AND METHODS: In all, 223 patients with T1b to T3a prostate cancer and a median (range) age of 66 (50-82) years were treated with permanent seed implantation from November 1990 to March 1998. They were followed for a median (range) of 8.2 (7-14.1) years using prospective quality-of-life measures. Erectile function (EF) was assessed using a physician-assigned score and beginning in June 2000; the validated International Index of EF (IIEF-5) was used as a complementary method to quantify late EF. No adjustment was made to differentiate sexual function with or with no pharmacological intervention for EF. Pearson's chi-square test and Student's t-test were used to compare the groups. RESULT(S): Of the 223 men, 131 (59%) had optimal EF before their brachytherapy; of these, 51 (40%) at the last follow-up evaluation were using either a phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitor (44, 86%), yohimbine (two, 4%) or alprostadil (five, 10%). The age at implantation was highly predictive of current EF; 23 of 25 (92%) men aged 50-59 years had a current EF of >=2; those aged 60-69 and 70-78 years had an EF of >=2 in 48/75 (64%) and 18/31 (58%) (P = 0.01). A current IIEF-5 score of >=16 also correlated highly with age at implant, i.e. 50-59, 16/25 (64%); 60-69, 20/75 (27%) and 70-78 years, 6/31 (19%) (P < 0.001).

Mixed-effects models of cognitive change by sex, Abeta-positron emission tomography, and apolipoprotein epsilon4 were examined with quadratic time effects over a median of 4 years of follow-up., RESULTS: Apolipoprotein epsilon4 prevalence and Abeta burden did not differ by sex. Sex did not directly influence cognitive decline. Females with higher Abeta exhibited faster decline than males. Post hoc contrasts suggested that females who were Abeta and apolipoprotein epsilon4 positive declined faster than their male counterparts., DISCUSSION: Although Abeta did not differ by sex, cognitive decline was greater in females with higher Abeta. Our findings suggest that sex may play a modifying role on risk of Alzheimer's disease-related cognitive decline. Copyright © 2018 the Alzheimer's Association. All rights reserved.",Excluded
1458,"Individual, Environmental, and Meteorological Predictors of Daily Personal Ultraviolet Radiation Exposure Measurements in a United States Cohort Study Background: Individual exposure to ultraviolet radiation (UVR) is challenging to measure, particularly for diseases with substantial latency periods between first exposure and diagnosis of outcome, such as cancer. To guide the choice of surrogates for long-term UVR exposure in epidemiologic studies, we assessed how well stable sun-related individual characteristics and environmental/meteorological factors predicted daily personal UVR exposure measurements. Method(s): We evaluated 123 United States Radiologic Technologists subjects who wore personal UVR dosimeters for 8 hours daily for up to 7 days (N = 837 days). Potential predictors of personal UVR derived from a self-administered questionnaire, and public databases that provided daily estimates of ambient UVR and weather conditions. Factors potentially related to personal UVR exposure were tested individually and in a model including all significant variables. Result(s): The strongest predictors of daily personal UVR exposure in the full model were ambient UVR, latitude, daily rainfall, and skin reaction to prolonged sunlight (R2 = 0.30). In a model containing only environmental and meteorological variables, ambient UVR, latitude, and daily rainfall were the strongest predictors of daily personal UVR exposure (R2 = 0.25). Conclusion(s): In the absence of feasible measures of individual longitudinal sun exposure history, stable personal characteristics, ambient UVR, and weather parameters may help estimate long-term personal UVR exposure.",Excluded

Fifty-two (5%) subjects had significant (>or=50%) diameter stenosis and 21 (2%) had severe (>or=75%) stenosis. Thirteen (25%) and 30 (58%) subjects with significant stenosis were classified into National Cholesterol Education Program low-risk and mild coronary calcification (coronary artery calcium scores <100), respectively. Midterm follow-up (17 +/- 2 months) revealed 15 cardiac events only in those with CAD on CTA: 1 unstable angina requiring hospital stay and 14 revascularization procedures. Most (87%) events occurred within 90 days of index CTA., CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of occult CAD in apparently healthy individuals was not negligible, although their midterm prognosis was good.

3554,"Combined Effects of Three High-Energy Charged Particle Beams Important for Space Flight on Brain, Behavioral and Cognitive Endpoints in B6D2F1 Female and Male Mice The radiation environment in deep space includes the galactic cosmic radiation with different proportions of all naturally occurring ions from protons to uranium. Most experimental animal studies for assessing the biological effects of charged particles have involved acute dose delivery for single ions and/or fractionated exposure protocols. Here, we assessed the behavioral and cognitive performance of female and male C57BL/6J x DBA2/J F1 (B6D2F1) mice 2 months following rapidly delivered, sequential irradiation with protons (1 GeV, 60%), 16O (250 MeV/n, 20%), and 28Si (263 MeV/n, 20%) at 0, 25, 50, or 200 cGy at 4-6 months of age. Cortical BDNF, CD68, and MAP-2 levels were analyzed 3 months after irradiation or sham irradiation. During the dark period, male mice irradiated with 50 cGy showed higher activity levels in the home cage than sham-irradiated mice. Mice irradiated with 50 cGy also showed increased depressive behavior in the forced swim test. When cognitive performance was assessed, sham-irradiated mice of both sexes and mice irradiated with 25 cGy showed normal responses to object recognition and novel object exploration. However, object recognition was impaired in female and male mice irradiated with 50 or 200 cGy. For cortical levels of the neurotrophic factor BDNF and the marker of microglial activation CD68, there were sex x radiation interactions. In females, but not males, there were increased CD68 levels following irradiation. In males, but not females, there were reduced BDNF levels following irradiation. A significant positive correlation between BDNF and CD68 levels was observed, suggesting a role for activated microglia in the alterations in BDNF levels. Finally, sequential beam irradiation impacted the diversity and composition of the gut microbiome. These included dose-dependent impacts and alterations to the relative abundance of several gut genera, such as Butyricicoccus and Lachnospiraceae. Thus, exposure to rapidly delivered sequential proton, 16O ion, and 28Si ion irradiation significantly affects behavioral and cognitive performance, cortical levels of CD68 and BDNF in a sex-dependent fashion, and the gut microbiome.",Included

271,"Increased lung cancer risk due to residential radon in a pooled and extended analysis of studies in Germany Residential radon has been shown to be a risk factor for lung cancer in several studies-but with limited power in each single study. The data of two case-control studies performed during 1990-1997 in Germany and used for previous publications have been extended and pooled. Both studies have identical study designs. In total, data of 2,963 incident lung cancer cases and 4,232 population controls are analyzed here. One-year radon measurements were performed in houses occupied during the 5-35 y prior to the interview. Conditional logistic and linear relative risk regression was used for the analysis. Measurements covered on average 70% of the exposure time window, with an average radon exposure of 61 Bq m(-3). The smoking and asbestos-adjusted ORs were 0.97 [95% confidence interval (CI) 0.85 to 1.11] for 50-80 Bq m(-3), 1.06 (95% CI 0.87 to 1.30) for 80-140 Bq m(-3) and 1.40 (95% CI 1.03 to 1.89) for radon concentrations above 140 Bq m(-3), compared to the reference category <50 Bq m(-3). The linear increase in the odds ratio per 100 Bq m(-3) was 0.10 (95% CI -0.02 to 0.30) for all subjects and 0.14 (95% CI -0.03 to 0.55) for less mobile subjects who lived in only one home in the last 5-35 y. The risk coefficients generally were higher when measurement error in the radon concentrations was reduced by restricting the population. With respect to histopathology, the risk for small cell carcinoma was higher than for other subtypes. This analysis strengthens the evidence that residential radon is a relevant risk factor for lung cancer.",Included
402,"Underprediction of visibly complex chromosome aberrations by a recombinational-repair ('one-hit') model Purpose: Published low-LET FISH data were used to test two models of chromosome aberration production based on breakage-and-reunion or recombinational repair. Material(s) and Method(s): Randomness of DNA double strand break induction and misrejoining is analyzed comprehensively and adopted as a working hypothesis. Proximity effects are approximated by using interaction sites. Model results are calculated using CAS (chromosome aberration simulator) Monte Carlo computer software with two adjustable parameters. CAS can emulate the specifics of any experimental painting protocol, allowing very detailed tests of the models. Result(s): To reasonable approximation, breakage-and-reunion model predictions are consistent with low-LET FISH results, including two large, elaborate, one-paint data sets. An explicitly specified version of the recombinational-repair model severely underpredicts the frequency of the visibly complex aberration patterns most commonly observed with one-paint FISH, and is inconsistent with some observed multi-paint patterns. When high-dose effects (distortion and saturation) are taken into account quantitatively, a dose-response relation for apparently simple interchanges slightly favours the breakage-and-reunion model over the recombinational-repair model, despite being approximately linear over the dose range 2-6 Gy. Conclusion(s): The random breakage-and-reunion model gives comprehensive baseline predictions that are sufficiently accurate for the organization of experimental results. The data speak against complex aberrations being formed by the random recombinational repair pathway discussed here.",Excluded
287,"Expanded Characterization of a Hemi-Body Shielded Gottingen Minipig Model of Radiation-induced Gastrointestinal Injury Incorporating Oral Dosing Procedures In collaboration with the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA), the authors recently conducted a pilot study in a hemi-body shielded model of radiation-induced gastrointestinal (GI) injury in Gottingen minipigs following exposure to radiation dose levels between 8-16 Gy. Herein, the impact of oral dosing procedures is assessed, as well as the specific causes of death in animals exposed to radiation doses of 14 and 16 Gy (n = 64; 32 male, 32 female, between 6 and 8 mo of age). Oral dosing using a 2-tablet placebo system comprised of both immediate release and enteric-coated tablets starting 24 h post-irradiation resulted in inhibited gastric emptying of the enteric-coated tablets, which were found to be retained in the stomach and/or regurgitated. This finding appears to be species-specific, as similar findings have not been reported for other large animal species (e.g., non-human primates). Mortality was primarily dictated by decreased activity, body weight loss (>35%), and/or respiratory distress, despite shielding of the lung. The cause of respiratory distress in animals that were pre-terminally euthanized varied according to the timing of death, with interstitial inflammation and extensive fibrosis observed >20 days post-irradiation. Kidney damage was also identified in most animals after day 10. Changes in the GI tract were consistent with previous studies and included collagen deposition/fibrosis. Observations of inflammatory infiltrates and interstitial inflammation/fibrosis in both shielded and unshielded organs support a strong secondary inflammatory syndrome post-irradiation.",Included

This study aims to investigate the association between ABT and symptomatic radiation necrosis (SRN) following stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS). Resected brain metastases (rBM) and arteriovenous malformation (AVM) patients treated with SRS from 2002 to 2015 were identified. Patients in the ABT cohort were on therapy during SRS and at 1-month follow up. Kaplan Meier method and cumulative incidence model were used to analyze overall survival (OS) and intracranial outcomes. 228 consecutive patients were treated with SRS: 111 with rBM and 117 with AVM. Overall, 51 (22.4%) patients were in the ABT group: 32 (28.8%) in the rBM and 19 (16.2%) in AVM cohorts. Baseline characteristics were similar, except for higher Graded Prognostic Analysis (3-4) in the rBM (ABT: 25.0% vs. non-ABT: 49.0%, p = 0.033) and median age in the AVM (ABT: 51.4 vs. non-ABT: 35.4, p < 0.001) cohorts. In both populations, OS and intracranial efficacy (rBM-local control; AVM-obliteration rates) were statistically similar between the cohorts. ABT was associated with lower 1-year SRN rates in both populations: rBM, 3.1 versus 25.3% (p = 0.003); AVM, 6.7 vs. 14.6% (p = 0.063). On multivariate analysis, ABT was a significant predictive factor for rBM (HR: 0.17; 95% CI 0.03-0.88, p = 0.035), but did not reach statistical significance for AVM (HR: 0.36; 95% CI 0.09-1.52, p = 0.165).

Clinical signs for these aging are different with the latter characterized by dryness, irregular pigmentation, sallowness, laxity, telangiectasia and leathery appearance.

Study was conducted on volunteers with facial photo-damage (n=24). TDR SPF34 was applied once daily in the morning up to 12 weeks. Investigator assessment and standardized digital photographs were obtained at week 4, 8 and 12. Punch biopsies (n=5) were obtained at baseline and week 12. Investigator assessments showed statistically significant improvements at week 12 when compared to baseline.

510,"Changes in lateral dimensions of irradiated volume and their impact on the accuracy of dose delivery during radiotherapy for head and neck cancer BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: To assess changes in lateral dimensions of irradiated volume during head and neck cancer radiotherapy and to determine their impact on the accuracy of dose delivery., PATIENTS AND METHODS: Lateral dimensions of irradiated volumes were measured in five predefined points prior to treatment and then bi-weekly. For each measurement, midline dose was calculated and verified using in vivo dosimetry. Early radiation reactions, patient weight changes and the need to modify radiotherapy accessories were also recorded. The study included 33 head and neck cancer patients irradiated using parallel opposed megavoltage fields., RESULTS: Body mass changes during radiotherapy ranged from -18 to +4 kg (median -5). Lateral dimension changes >5 mm (range -37 to +16) occurred in 32 patients (97%). For axis measurements, the degree of lateral dimension changes were correlated with treatment field size (P = 0.022) and degree of mucositis (P = 0.017). Axis doses calculated for changed dimensions varied from those prescribed by -2.5 to +6% (median +2%). Differences larger than 5% were present in 4.8% of calculations. In 17 patients (52%), radiotherapy accessories had to be modified during treatment. The need to modify radiotherapy accessories correlated with larger treatment portals (P = 0.004), more weight loss during treatment (P = 0.01) and higher initial N stage (P = 0.04)., CONCLUSIONS: Changes of irradiated volume lateral dimensions during head and neck cancer radiotherapy may lead to considerable dose delivery inaccuracies. Watchful monitoring, corrections to calculated dose when changes observed are significant and radiotherapy accessories modification during the course of treatment are strongly recommended.",Excluded

Gastric acid is one of the important factors for optimum absorption of iron. Proton pump inhibitors are very commonly prescribed medications. One of the debated effects of proton pump inhibitors is on oral iron absorption. Their effect on absorption of oral iron supplementation in iron-deficient patients has not been studied. At the Cooper Hematology Outpatient office, we reviewed charts of iron-deficient anemic patients who were on omeprazole for the last 4 years. Fifty patients having no apparent ongoing blood loss, having other causes of anemia especially that of chronic diseases ruled out, and on omeprazole while starting ferrous sulfate therapy for iron deficiency were selected for chart review. The iron-study results at the start of oral ferrous sulfate therapy and at 3 months follow-up were compared to evaluate the response of ferrous sulfate. The mean hemoglobin change was 0.8 +/- 1.2 g/L. The mean change in ferrtin values was 10.2 +/- 7.8 mug/L. Only 16% of the patients had a normal response to hemoglobin levels (rise of >2 g/dL), and only 40% had a normal response to ferritin levels (rise of >20 mug/dL). The average age of patients having a suboptimal response to both hemoglobin and ferritin was significantly higher compared with that of the patients with an optimal response. Omeprazole and possibly all proton pump inhibitors decrease the absorption of oral iron supplementation. Iron-deficient patients taking proton pump inhibitors may have to be treated with high dose iron therapy for a longer duration or with intravenous iron therapy.",Excluded
420,"Effect of gamma radiation on resting B lymphocytes. II. Functional characterization of the antigen-presentation defect The effect of radiation on three discrete Ag-presentation functions in resting B cells was examined: 1) Ag uptake and processing, 2) expression of processed Ag in the context of functional class II molecules, and 3) provision of necessary co-stimulatory, or second,"" signals. Analysis of radiation's effect on B cell presentation of intact vs fragmented Ag or its effect on presentation by Ag-pulsed B cells indicated that damage to Ag uptake and processing could not account for the bulk of the radiation-induced Ag-presentation defect. Experiments with phosphatidylinositol hydrolysis as an indirect measure of TCR occupancy suggested that irradiation caused a fairly rapid (within 1 to 2 h) decrease in the ability of the B cell APC to display a stimulatory combination of Ag and class II molecule. Ag dose-response analyses demonstrated that when presenting a fragment of the Ag pigeon cytochrome c to a T cell clone, 3000 rad-treated B cell APC were able to stimulate approximately 50% as much phosphatidylinositol turnover as unirradiated B cells. It was also found that, in contrast to their inability to initiate T cell proliferation, and similarly to chemically cross-linked splenocytes, heavily irradiated resting B cells plus Ag induced a state of Ag hyporesponsiveness in T cell clones. This effect on T cells had the same Ag- and MHC-specificity as did receptor occupancy required for proliferation, indicating that heavily irradiated resting B cells bear functional class II molecules. Co-culture of T cells with allogeneic B cells and syngeneic heavily irradiated B cells or chemically cross-linked splenic APC plus Ag resulted in T cell proliferation and interfered with the induction of the hyporesponsive state. This co-stimulatory function was radiosensitive in resting allogeneic B cells. Together, these data support the hypothesis that the major functional consequences of radiation to resting B cell APC are a reduction in the effective display of Ag plus class II molecules and, probably what is more important, a loss in the ability to provide APC-derived co-stimulatory signals.""",Included
453,"Utility of postoperative radiographs for cervical spine fusion: A comprehensive evaluation of operative technique, surgical indication, and duration since surgery STUDY DESIGN.: A retrospective study. OBJECTIVE.: To assess the utility of postoperative radiographs in patients across a spectrum of cervical fusion procedures, surgical indication, and time since surgery. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA.: Postoperative radiographs are routinely obtained after cervical spine fusion despite lack of evidence supporting such practice. Studies assessing postoperative radiographical utility in the cervical spine have been limited. To date, no study has comprehensively evaluated the utility of obtaining such radiographs across multiple cervical fusion procedures. METHODS.: A total of 972 clinic notes from 301 patients during a 10-year period at a single institution were retrospectively reviewed. Patients in this study underwent an anterior cervical discectomy and fusion, anterior corpectomy and fusion, a combined anterior cervical discectomy and fusion and anterior corpectomy and fusion (hybrid), posterior spine fusion, or 360degree fusion. All postoperative clinic notes and radiographs were reviewed for abnormalities and changes in treatment course. It was determined whether an abnormal radiograph alone led to a change in treatment course among the various operative techniques, surgical indication, or time since surgery. RESULTS.: No statistical significant difference in radiograph utility between anterior cervical discectomy and fusion (0 changes in treatment course due to radiograph alone out of 332 clinic notes), anterior corpectomy and fusion (0 of 140), hybrid procedure (1 of 72), posterior spine fusion (5 of 357), and 360degree fusion (0 of 71) was found. Surgical indication (trauma vs. degeneration) and duration from surgery yielded no statistical significant difference in radiograph utility. The overall sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values of radiographs were 33.8%, 87.6%, 19.0%, and 93.9%, respectively. CONCLUSION.: Regardless of operative techniques performed, surgical indication, and time since surgery, routine postoperative radiographs provide low utility in guiding treatment course in asymptomatic patients. Although radiographs may provide important diagnostic utility in certain individual cases, the results of this study provide further evidence that radiographs should not be considered routine during postoperative visits, thus minimizing unnecessary radiation exposure and medical costs.

21,"Effects of laser irradiation on arthritic histopathology and heat shock protein 70 expression in C57 black mice with osteoarthritis OBJECTIVE: To study the effects of three different laser treatments (650 nm alone, 10.6 mum alone and combined laser of 650 nm and 10.6 mum) on experimental osteoarthritis of the knees in C57 black mice., METHODS: Sixty C57 black mice were divided randomly into 6 groups. Ten mice were assigned to a normal control group (no intervention) and the other 5 groups were subjected to a forced running regimen to induce osteoarthritis. One group was set as the model control group. The other 4 groups were given 90 s of a 650 nm laser, 90 s of a 10.6 mum laser, 90 s of a combined laser, or a sham treatment on acupoint Dubi (ST35) of the rear left leg 3 times per week for 4 weeks. The modified Mankin score was used to evaluate the degree of cartilage degradation. Immunohistochemical staining for heat shock protein (HSP) 70 was conducted., RESULTS: Mankin scores of the model control group and the sham control group were significantly higher than that of the normal control group (P<0.01). Mankin score of the combined laser group was significantly lower than that of the model control group (P<0.01). Compared with the normal control group, there was a significant induction of HSP70 in the arthritic chondrocytes of the combined laser group., CONCLUSION: The arthritic cartilage induced in C57 black mice improved significantly after combined laser treatment of 650 nm and 10.6 mum lasers. This effect may be related to the induction of HSP70 in the arthritic chondrocytes. The two different lasers appear to have a synergistic effect.",Excluded
606,"Dosimetry and toxicity of Quadramet for bone marrow ablation in multiple myeloma and other haematological malignancies Standard treatment regimens for haematological malignancies include myeloablative chemoradiotherapy and subsequent rescue by stem cell transplantation. However, these treatment regimens have significant associated mortality and morbidity, and disease recurrence remains a problem. One alternative approach is the targeted delivery of radiotherapy to the marrow using a bone-seeking agent labelled with an appropriate radioisotope, with the aim of delivering a potentially ablative radiation dose to marrow while minimising non-haematological toxicity. Pharmacokinetics and radiation dosimetry for a commercial preparation of samarium-153 ethylene diamine tetramethylene phosphonate (EDTMP; Quadramet) were evaluated in 43 tracer (average dose 740 MBq) studies of 42 patients with haematological malignancies. Measurements of 24-h retention were also available following infusion of 18-48 GBq in 15 patients. Quadramet cleared rapidly from the tissue, with a median biological half-life of 1.4 h. Activity taken up by the skeleton was firmly bound, with activity decreasing according to physical half-life at 24 h in 29 of the 43 cases. The percentage activity retained in the skeleton at 24 h with tracer doses was high (62%+/-13%), although this decreased to approximately 30% with therapy infusions. Because of this decrease in retention, the maximum feasible therapy activity for this formulation of Quadramet is 35 GBq. Median absorbed marrow radiation dose was 0.78 Gy/GBq in tracer studies: the decreased retention at high activities means that this corresponds to a median dose of 12 Gy for 35 GBq administered activity. It is possible to use 24-h retention as a rough guide to marrow dose in individual patients. In tracer studies, median bladder radiation dose was 0.22 Gy/GBq and radiation dose to the liver was very conservatively estimated at 0.2 Gy/GBq. After therapy infusions of up to 50 GBq in 37 patients, non-haematopoietic toxicity was not seen in any patient. In addition, myelosuppression was achieved without evidence of myelofibrosis. The residual dose rate to marrow fell to a level acceptable for stem cell re-infusion by 2 weeks after administration.",Excluded

2127,"Abnormal bone mineralization after fluoride treatment in osteoporosis: a small-angle x-ray-scattering study Sodium fluoride treatment of osteoporosis is known to stimulate bone formation and to increase bone mass, but recent clinical trials failed to prove its antifracture effectiveness. The formation of bone with abnormal structure and, therefore, increased fragility is discussed as a possible explanation. Until now, however, exact information on the mineral structure of osteoporotic bone after fluoride treatment has been lacking. Bone biopsies were taken from three patients with postmenopausal osteoporosis before and after fluoride treatment (60 mg NaF/day for 1-2 years), from one patient with iatrogenic fluorosis, as well as from three normal controls. The mineral in these samples was investigated by a combination of backscattered electron imaging and small-angle x-ray scattering. Depending on the total dose of fluoride, an increasing amount of new bone is laid down on the surface of preexisting trabeculae. Its mineral structure is identical to that of heavy fluorosis and is characterized by the presence of additional large crystals, presumably located outside the collagen fibrils. These large crystals, which are not present in the controls or in osteoporotic bone before fluoride treatment, contribute to increase the mineral density without significantly improving the biomechanical properties of the bone. The possible success of fluoride treatment depends not only on the amount of newly formed bone but also on the rate of bone turnover. Indeed, as soon as significant amounts of fluoride are present, bone turnover leads to the replacement of old (normal) bone by new (pathologically mineralized) bone.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",Excluded
1488,"Long-term hearing outcomes following stereotactic radiosurgery for vestibular schwannoma: Patterns of hearing loss and variables influencing audiometric decline Object. The goals of this retrospective cohort study were as follows: 1) to describe the long-term prevalence and timing of hearing deterioration following low-dose (12- to 13-Gy marginal dose) stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) for vestibular schwannoma (VS); and 2) to identify clinical variables associated with long-term preservation of useful hearing following treatment. Methods. Patients with serviceable hearing who underwent SRS for VS between 1997 and 2002 were studied. Data including radiosurgery treatment plans, tumor characteristics, pre- and posttreatment pure tone average, speech discrimination scores, and American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery hearing class were collected. Time to nonserviceable hearing was estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method. Univariate and multivariate associations with time to nonserviceable hearing were evaluated using Cox proportional hazards regression models. Results. Forty-four patients met the study criteria and were included. The median duration of audiometric follow- up was 9.3 years. Thirty-six patients developed nonserviceable hearing at a mean of 4.2 years following SRS. The Kaplan-Meier estimated rates of serviceable hearing at 1, 3, 5, 7, and 10 years following SRS were 80%, 55%, 48%, 38%, and 23%, respectively. Multivariate analysis revealed that pretreatment ipsilateral pure tone average (p < 0.001) and tumor size (p = 0.009) were statistically significantly associated with time to nonserviceable hearing. Conclusions. Durable hearing preservation a decade after low-dose SRS for VS occurs in less than one-fourth of patients. Variables including preoperative hearing capacity and tumor size may be used to predict hearing outcomes following treatment. These findings may assist in pretreatment risk disclosure. Furthermore, these data demonstrate the importance of long-term follow-up when reporting audiometric outcomes following SRS for VS. © AANS, 2013.",Excluded

1671,"Three-dimensional structures of avian beta-microseminoproteins: insight from the chicken egg-specific beta-microseminoprotein 3 paralog Beta-microseminoproteins (MSMBs) are small disulfide-rich proteins that are conserved among vertebrates. These proteins exhibit diverse biological activities and were mainly reported to play a role in male fertility, immunity, and embryogenesis. In this work, we focused on the chicken MSMB3 protein that was previously depicted as an egg antibacterial protein. We report that MSMB3 protein is exclusively expressed in the reproductive tissues of laying hens (in contrast to chicken MSMB1 and MSMB2 paralogs), to be incorporated in the egg white during the process of egg formation. We also showed that chicken MSMB3 possesses highly conserved orthologs in bird species, including Neognathae and Palaeognathae. Chicken MSMB3 was purified from egg white using heparin affinity chromatography and was analyzed by top-down and bottom-up proteomics. Several proteoforms could be characterized, and a homodimer was further evidenced by NMR spectroscopy. The X-ray structure of chicken MSMB3 was solved for the first time, revealing that this protein adopts a novel dimeric arrangement. The highly cationic MSMB3 protein exhibits a distinct electrostatic distribution compared with chicken MSMB1 and MSMB2 structural models, and with published mammalian MSMB structures. The specific incorporation of MSMB3 paralog in the egg, and its phylogenetic conservation in birds together with its peculiar homodimer arrangement and physicochemical properties, suggests that the MSMB3 protein has evolved to play a critical role during the embryonic development of avian species. These new data are likely to stimulate research to elucidate the structure/function relationships of MSMB paralogs and orthologs in the animal kingdom.Copyright © 2021 The Authors.

960,"RadRAT: a radiation risk assessment tool for lifetime cancer risk projection Risk projection methods allow for timely assessment of the potential magnitude of radiation-related cancer risks following low-dose radiation exposures. The estimation of such risks directly through observational studies would generally require infeasibly large studies and long-term follow-up to achieve reasonable statistical power. We developed an online radiation risk assessment tool (RadRAT) which can be used to estimate the lifetime risk of radiation-related cancer with uncertainty intervals following a user-specified exposure history (https://irep.nci.nih.gov/radrat). The uncertainty intervals constitute a key component of the program because of the various assumptions that are involved in such calculations. The risk models used in RadRAT are broadly based on those developed by the BEIR VII committee for estimating lifetime risk following low-dose radiation exposure of the US population for eleven site-specific cancers. We developed new risk models for seven additional cancer sites, oral, oesophagus, gallbladder, pancreas, rectum, kidney and brain/central nervous system (CNS) cancers, using data from Japanese atomic bomb survivors. The lifetime risk estimates are slightly higher for RadRAT than for BEIR VII across all exposure ages mostly because the weighting of the excess relative risk and excess absolute risk models was conducted on an arithmetic rather than a logarithmic scale. The calculator can be used to estimate lifetime cancer risk from both uniform and non-uniform doses that are acute or chronic. It is most appropriate for low-LET radiation doses < 1 Gy, and for individuals with life-expectancy and cancer rates similar to the general population in the US.",Excluded
705,"Assessment of radiation-induced liver injury with computed tomography OBJECTIVE: To review the appearance of radiation-induced liver injury on computer tomography for quantitative assessment of dosimetric changes in different radiological reactions and the influence of time-effect. METHOD(S): The focal liver reactions of 35 patients treated with three-dimensional conformal radiation therapy (3-D CRT) for liver malignancies were evaluated, with the applied doses of 36-65 Gy in 4-28 fractions completed in 8-41 days. All patients received nonenhanced CT scan and arterial-dominant phase contrast-enhanced CT scan 1-6 months after therapy. The liver tissue density in irradiated and nonirradiated liver was compared, and the reaction type and the threshold dose determined radiologically. RESULT(S): On at least one follow-up examination, 51.4% of patients were found to have a focal radiation reaction in the liver. The radiation reaction was hypodense in 43.75% of the follow-up nonenhanced CT examinations and in 19.23% of arterial-dominant phase contrast-enhanced CT scans. It was hyperdense in 42.31% of arterial-dominant phase contrast-enhanced CT scans. The median threshold dose inducing a radiation reaction was 30.8 Gy (range 18-42.8 Gy). The detected threshold dose was positively correlated with the time of detection of the reaction (P=0.041), with a correlation coefficient of -0.473. On arterial-dominant phase contrast-enhanced CT scans, the threshold dose was significantly higher for hyperdense than for hypodense changes (P=0.017). In additional follow-up, the reaction volume decreased and the reaction types changed on arterial-dominant phase contrast-enhanced CT scans. CONCLUSION(S): The threshold dose can be different in different radiological reaction types on multiphase CT scans. The detected threshold dose is inversely correlated with the time of detection of the early reaction. Multiphase contrast-enhanced CT is helpful to distinguish radiation reactions from recurrent tumors.",Excluded

1290,"Monitoring of residual hematopoiesis after total body irradiation in humans as a model for accidental x-ray exposure: dose-effect and failure of ex vivo expansion of residual stem cells in view of autografting PURPOSE: To evaluate the residual hematopoiesis at different levels of total body irradiation (TBI) dose in bone marrow (BM) and peripheral blood (PB), and to study the dose-effect relationship on hematopoietic immature and mature progenitors. We also investigated the possibility of expanding ex vivo the residual progenitors exposed to different dose levels of TBI., METHODS AND MATERIALS: Eight patients treated for AML (n = 3) and myeloma (n = 5) were included. BM and PB samples were harvested before TBI and after doses of: 5 Gy. Mononuclear cells (MNCs) were assayed for burst-forming unit erythroid (BFU-E), granulocyte-forming unit macrophage (CFU-GM), and long-term culture initiating cells (LTC-ICs). Ex vivo expansion: MNCs (after irradiation and controls) were suspended in long-term cultures and expanded with a combination of five cytokines., RESULTS: CD34+ cells were detectable at 10 Gy. We observed a significant decrease of CFU-GM and BFU-E, respectively, to 13.5% and 8.5% of baseline values for doses <or=2 Gy and to 8.2% and 4.6% for doses ranging between 2.1 and 5 Gy. No dose effect was observed for residual MNCs. LTC-ICs were not detectable after 0.8 Gy. The expansion was not successful after 1.2 Gy., CONCLUSION: This study confirms the significant decrease of human mature and immature progenitors in BM and PB immediately after low-dose TBI. In addition, the lack of expansion suggests that autografting using BM or PB residual stem cells collected and expanded in vitro in case of accidental whole body exposure may be impractical.",Excluded

476,"Increased radiation from Chernobyl decreases the expression of red colouration in natural populations of bank voles (Myodes glareolus) Pheomelanin is a pink to red version of melanin pigment deposited in skin and hair. Due to its bright colour, pheomelanin plays a crucial function in signalling, in particular sexual signalling. However, production of pheomelanin, as opposed to its dark alternative, eumelanin, bears costs in terms of consumption of antioxidants important for protection of DNA against naturally produced reactive oxidative species. Therefore, decreased expression of pheomelanin is expected in organisms exposed to severe oxidative stress such as that caused by exposure to chronic ionizing radiation. We tested if variable exposure to radiation among natural populations of bank voles Myodes glareolus in Chernobyl affected expression of red colouration in their dorsal fur. The relative redness of dorsal fur was positively correlated with weight, but also negatively correlated with the level of background radiation. These results suggest that the development of the natural red colouration in adult bank voles is affected by ionizing background radiation, and potentially causing elevated levels of oxidative stress. Reduced production of pheomelanin allows more antioxidants to mitigate the oxidative stress caused by radiation. However, changing natural animal colouration for physiological reasons can have ecological costs, if e.g. it causes mismatch with habitat colouration and conspicuousness for predators.",Included

To investigate this, we exposed 4-mo-old female Balb/cBYJ mice to an acute space-relevant dose of 0.5 Gy 56Fe or sham (n = ~8/group); 4 days later, half of the mice were also subjected to a ground-based analog for 1/6 g (partial weightbearing) (G/6) for 21 days. Microcomputed tomography (-CT) of the distal femur reveals that 56Fe exposure resulted in 6578% greater volume and improved microarchitecture of cancellous bone after 21 d compared to sham controls. Radiation also leads to significant increases in three measures of energy absorption at the mid-shaft femur and an increase in stiffness of the L4 vertebra. No significant effects of radiation on bone formation indices are detected; however, G/6 leads to reduced % mineralizing surface on the inner mid-tibial bone surface. In separate groups allowed 21 days of weightbearing recovery from G/6 and/or 56Fe exposure, radiation-exposed mice still exhibit greater bone mass and improved microarchitecture vs. sham control. However, femoral bone energy absorption values are no longer higher in the 56Fe-exposed WB mice vs. sham controls.

120,"Individualizing cancer treatment: biological optimization models in treatment planning and delivery PURPOSE: During the last 30 years radiation therapy has developed from classical rectangular beams via conformation therapy with largely uniform dose delivery, but irregular field shapes, to fully intensity modulated dose delivery where the total dose distribution in the tumor can be fully controlled in three dimensions. This last step has been developed during the last 15-20 years and has opened up the possibilities for truly optimized radiation therapy., METHODS AND MATERIALS: Today it is not only possible to produce almost any desired dose distribution in the tumor volume. It is also possible to deliver the dose distribution, which has the highest probability to cure the patient without inducing severe complications in normal tissues. To fully exploit the advantages of intensity-modulated radiation therapy, quality of life or radiobiologic objectives have to be used, preferably combined with predictive assay of radiation sensitivity., RESULTS: This article will briefly discuss the biologic objective functions and the associated advantages in the treatment outcome using new approaches such as consideration of stochastic variations in sensitivity and optimization of the angle of incidence and fractionation schedule with intensity-modulated beams. Finally, different possibilities for realizing general three-dimensional intensity-modulated dose delivery will be discussed., CONCLUSIONS: Once accurate genetically and/or cell survival based predictive assays become available, radiation therapy will become an exact science allowing truly individual optimization considering also the panorama of side-effects that the patient is willing to accept.",Excluded

Neither white-coat nor masked hypertension were associated with all-cause mortality. Patients with arterio-venous fistula showed significantly better survival when compared to patients with permanent dialysis catheters and in the linear regression model MIS/PEW and PWV were the only predictors of longer survival (b =-0.371, p = 0.001; b =-0.249, p = 0.009). Conclusion(s): Blood pressure characteristics (ABPM) were not predictors of allcause mortality in patients undergoing chronic hemodialysis. On contrary, arterial stiffness and malnutrition were associated with shorter survival. Observed better survival of patients with A-V fistula compared to patients with permanent catheter is very probably reverse epidemiology. Due to small number of CV deaths we were not able to perform analyzes of CV deaths.",Excluded

Patients were randomized to 80-kVp imaging (n = 103) or 100-kVp imaging (n = 105). Three blinded readers graded interpretability and image quality. Study signal, noise, and contrast were also compared., RESULTS: Imaging with 80 kVp instead of 100 kVp was associated with 47% lower median radiation dose (median dose-length product, 62.0 mGy . cm [interquartile range, 54.0-123.3 mGy . cm] vs 117.0 mGy . cm [110.0-225.9 mGy . cm], respectively; 0.9 mSv [0.8-1.7 mSv] vs 1.6 mSv [1.4-3.2 mSv]; p < 0.001 for each) with no significant difference in interpretability (99% vs 99%; p = 0.99) or image quality (median score, 4.0 [interquartile range, 3.6-4.0] vs 4.0 [interquartile range, 3.8-4.0]; p = 0.20). Studies obtained using 80 kVp were associated with 27% increased signal (mean +/- SD, 756 +/- 157 vs 594 +/- 105 HU; p < 0.001), 25% higher contrast (890 +/- 156 vs 709 +/- 108 HU; p < 0.001), and 50% greater noise (55 +/- 15 vs 37 +/- 12 HU; p < 0.001) with resultant 15% and 16% decreases in signal-to-noise (mean +/- SD, 15 +/- 5 vs 17 +/- 5; p < 0.001) and contrast-to-noise (mean +/- SD, 17 +/- 6 vs 21 +/- 5; p < 0.001) ratios, respectively., CONCLUSION: Coronary CTA using 80 kVp instead of 100 kVp was associated with a nearly 50% reduction in radiation dose with no significant difference in interpretability and noninferior image quality despite lower signal-to-noise and contrast-to-noise ratios. The use of 80-kVp tube voltage should be considered in dose-reduction strategies for coronary CTA of individuals with a normal BMI.",Excluded

The registry includes 188 plutonium-induced lung fibrosis diagnoses: 117 (62.23%) in males and 71 (37.77%) in females. This paper describes the structure and detailed characteristics of the registry. Plutonium-induced lung fibrosis was shown to have no association with cumulative lung absorbed dose from external gamma rays as of the date of diagnosis. On the contrary, the plutonium-induced lung fibrosis rate was shown to be associated with cumulative lung absorbed dose from incorporated alpha particles and to increase significantly with increasing dose from internal radiation exposure.

750,"Systematic effects of surgical treatment of hip fractures: gliding screw-plating vs intramedullary nailing AIM: Numerous studies have been published regarding the comparison between intramedullary nail and the dynamic hip screw and plate for the fixation of intertrochanteric fractures in elderly patients. In this paper we present a comparative study of these two methods regarding their systemic effects on this group of patients., MATERIALS-METHODS: This is a randomized trial of 120 consecutive patients with an intertrochanteric fracture treated with either extramedullary fixation (dynamic hip screw and plate; DHS, Synthes-Stratec, Oberdorf, Switzerland) or intramedullary nail (Gamma nail, Stryker Howmedica, Freiburg, Germany and Endovis BA, Citieffe, Bologna, Italy). The parameters that we assessed pre-operatively, in addition to their demographics, included their mental state (MMSE), their nutritional and immune state and their pulmonary function. Intra-operatively we calculated the amount of radiation exposure, the amount of blood loss and the length of operative time for each procedure. Postoperatively we repeated the calculation of the mental and pulmonary state and the blood loss, during days 1, 3, and 10 and related them to the ease of the patient's mobilization., RESULTS: Decreased bleeding and post-operative pain, reduced post-operative morbidity and faster recovery of function were better but not significant in the group of intramedullary fixation (all p>0.05). However, in the same group there were slightly more patients in whom the MMSE was falling, together with their pulmonary function, suggesting that this method probably predisposes to higher chances of pulmonary dysfunction and the possibility of pulmonary embolism., CONCLUSION: We found no significant differences between the two methods of stabilization of these fractures regarding their systemic effects perioperatively. The classic dynamic hip screw can preserve its position as a safe and effective solution for these already vulnerable patients having sustained a trochanteric fracture against the novel intramedullary techniques.

1950,"Application of an artificial neural network model for early outcome prediction of gamma knife radiosurgery in patients with trigeminal neuralgia and determining the relative importance of risk factors Objectives: Stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) is a minimally invasive modality for the treatment of trigeminal neuralgia (TN). Outcome prediction of this modality is very important for proper case selection. The aim of this study was to create artificial neural networks (ANN) to predict the clinical outcomes after gamma knife radiosurgery (GKRS) in patients with TN, based on preoperative clinical factors. Patients and Methods: We used the clinical findings of 155 patients who were underwent GKRS (from March 2000 to march 2015) at Iran Gamma Knife center, Teheran, Iran. Univariate analysis was performed for a long list of risk factors, and those with P-Value < 0.2 were used to create back-propagation ANN models to predict pain reduction and hypoesthesia after GKRS. Pain reduction was defined as BNI score 3a or lower and hypoesthesia was defined as BNI score 3 or 4. Result(s): Typical trigeminal neuralgia (TTN) (P-Value = 0.018) and age>65 (P-Value = 0.040) were significantly associated with successful pain reduction and three other variables including radiation dosage >85 (P-Value = 0.098), negative history of diabetes mellitus (P-Value = 0.133) and depression (P-Value = 0.190). On the other hand, radio dosage>85 (P-Value = 0.008) was significantly associated with hypoesthesia, other related risk factors (with p-Value<0.2), were history of multiple sclerosis (P-Value = 0.106), pain duration more than 10 years before GKRS (P-Value = 0.115), history of depression (P-Value = 0.139), history of percutaneous ablative procedures (P-Value = 0.148) and history of diabetes mellitus (P-Value = 0.169).ANN models could predict pain reduction and hypoesthesia with the accuracy of 84.5% and 91.5% respectively. By mutual elimination of each factor in this model we could also evaluate the contribution of each factor in the predictive performance of ANN. Conclusion(s): The findings show that artificial neural networks can predict post operative outcomes in patients who underwent GKRS with a high level of accuracy. Also the contribution of each factor in the prediction of outcomes can be determined using the trained network.Copyright © 2018",Excluded

They were divided into 3 groups. Group I (n: 25) used Fexofenadine 120 mg, O.D., for 14 days. Group II (n: 25) used CPM 4 mg, O.D., for 14 days. Group III (n: 25) used Betametasone 0.5 mg, B.D., for 7 days. Presenting complaints with duration, personal history of exposure to any allergens, family history of any allergies, general examination of the patient, ENT examination, Investigations: CBP with DLC, Absolute eosinophil count, X-Ray of paranasal sinuses, Skin test for allergy, IgE levels in the serum. Result(s): The three drugs Fexofenadine, Chlorpheneramine and Betametasone were found to have similar levels of efficacy in controlling the symptoms of allergic rhinitis. The physical signs improved better with Chlorpheneramine than the other two drugs. Fexofenadine was found to be most effective in suppression of skin reactions to the allergens. It was closely followed by Betametasone and then Chlorpheneramine. The anti-histamine, Fexofenadine and Chlorpheneramine had no significant effect on the absolute eosinophil count and serum IgE levels whereas Betametasone had significant effect. The Cost burden is extremely low on patients using CPM followed by betamethasone than n fexofenadine. Conclusion(s): According to the results Fexofenadine, CPM Betamethasone have almost equally therapeutic efficacy. Betamethasone cannot be given for very long time because of its wide range of side effects.

Therefore, the aim of this study was to analyse the effects of seasonal conditions on 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) serum levels in a population-based cohort of older people., METHODS: between March 2009 and April 2010 the 25(OH)D serum level was assessed in 1,418 community-dwelling individuals living in Germany aged >=65 years (56.7% men) with no subscribed vitamin D supplementation. Least-square means of monthly 25(OH)D serum levels with 95% confidence intervals (CI) were estimated, adjusted for gender, age and body mass index. Additionally, the proportion of vitamin deficiency (<20 ng/ml), insufficiency (20-<30 ng/ml) and sufficiency (30 ng/ml or higher) were estimated for each month. Finally, mean values of daily total global solar radiation and daylight were calculated for each month., RESULTS: the minimum 25(OH)D serum level was observed in March with 15.4 ng/ml (SD = 6.56 ng/ml) and the maximum in August with 25.6 ng/ml (SD = 6.59 ng/ml). Compared with daylight and global solar radiation the progression over the year was similar but delayed by ~2 months. The proportion of vitamin D deficiency, insufficiency and sufficiency were 78.8, 19.2 and 1.9% in March and 16.1, 63.4 and 20.5% in August, respectively., CONCLUSION: vitamin D insufficiency was very common in this cohort and showed a strong seasonal effect with lowest values in March.",Excluded

The dose delivered was 45 Gy (1.80 Gy per fraction) in IMRT technique. Concurrent 5-fluorouracil-based chemotherapy at 225 mg/m(2) was administered as a continuous intravenous infusion. Primary endpoints were acute gastrointestinal toxicity (CTC 4.0) and technical feasibility of IMRT in regard to dose planning and radiation delivery., RESULTS: Early acute events were defined as clinical and chemical adverse effects of IMRT and concurrent chemotherapy during treatment. By definition, 90 days after the end of IMRT has been evaluated as acute-phase toxicity. No patient had grade 4 or higher acute adverse events. Clinical grade 3 toxicity occurred in two patients (8%) with diarrhea and in one case (4%) with nausea. Hematological changes with grade 3 occurred in three cases (12%) with hemoglobin decrease, in five cases (25%) as leukopenia, and in one case (4%) with thrombocytopenia. The mean dose for liver was 16 Gy and the percentage volume exceeding 30 Gy (V30) was 21%. Mean dose for right and left kidney was 9 and 13 Gy, respectively, and V20 was 9% and 13%, respectively. Heart received a median dose of 15 Gy and V40 was 17%. The mean dose to the bowel was 11 Gy and V40 was 6%. Spinal cord had at maximum 33 Gy in median. Specifics of dose distribution, including the coverage, for the target region were as follows: minimum was 33 Gy, maximum 48.6 Gy, and mean dose 44.6 Gy. The prescribed dose (45 Gy) covered 99% and 95% of planning target volume (OTV) in 66% and 92% of cases, respectively. Median PTV was 15.77 ml (range, 805-3,604 ml)., CONCLUSIONS: The data support the practical feasibility of IMRT in adjuvant treatment in high-risk gastric cancer in the postoperative setting as a proof of principle.

Subsequently, to analyze retrospectively patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA), psoriatic arthritis (PsA) or ankylosing spondylitis (AS), who started TNF-alpha inhibition in 2006. Points to consider, regarded relevant for individual treatment decisions as well as their assessment methods, were ascertained by experts' consensus applying the Delphi technique. Subsequently, these parameters' thresholds with respect to the initiation of a TNF-alpha-blocker were identified. Thereafter, the rheumatologists representing 12 centres all over Austria agreed to retrospectively analyze their patients started on a TNF-alpha-blocker in 2006. Experts' opinion regarding disease parameters relevant to initiate TNF-alpha-blockers in RA patients only slightly differed from those applied in clinical trials, but the parameters' threshold values were considerably lower. For PsA patients, some differences and for AS patients, considerable differences between experts' opinion and clinical studies appeared, which held also true for decisive parameters' means and thresholds. Six hundred and fifty patients, started on TNF-blockers in 2006, could be analyzed retrospectively, 408 RA patients (53.3 years mean, 340 females), 93 PsA patients (48.9 years mean, 59 males) and 149 AS patients AS (42.2 years mean, 108 males), representing approximately 25% of all Austrian patients initiated on a TNF-blocker in this respective year.

This study was aimed to investigate and quantify this learning effect, with fluoroscopy time and dose-area product (DAP) as parameters. We collected procedure data of the first to the fortieth cerebral DSA consecutively performed by 13 trainees in a training centre. DAP, procedure time, fluoroscopy time, number of cine-frames of the first 20 DSA procedures performed by these trainees were compared with that of the second 20 procedures. There was no significant difference concerning the procedure time between the first and the second 20 procedures (56.3 +/- 29.5 vs 51.5 +/- 20.2 min, p = 0.113). Numbers of cine-frames were very similar between the first and the second 20 procedures (750.7 +/- 290.3 vs 744.5 +/- 188.7, p = 0.830). Fluoroscopy time of the first 20 procedures was significantly longer than that of the second 20 procedures (17.8 +/- 15.4 vs 12.6 +/- 9.0, p = 0.001). DAP of the first 20 procedures was significantly higher than that of the second 20 procedures (6.4 +/- 4.9 vs 3.8 +/- 1.8, p < 0.001). DAP was correlated significantly with the performer's experience (R = -0.288, p < 0.001). There exists a learning effect of radiation exposure during cerebral DSA procedures performed by trainees. The learning effect is significant during the first 20 procedures, and becomes insignificant after 20 procedures. Insufficient catheter skills in novice trainees may be one reason for this effect. © The Author 2011. Published by Oxford University Press. All rights reserved.",Excluded

Material(s) and Method(s): In a prospective randomized trial patients with extraarticular fractures of the distal radius (AO 23 A3) were randomly assigned to receive either palmar plating (PP) (2.4mm, Synthes, USA) or intramedullary nailing (TDR) (Targon DR, Aesculap, Germany). Follow up examinations were performed 8 weeks and 2 years post surgery. Result(s): 152 patients (129 female and 23 male, mean age 62.9+/-15.6 years) were included and randomly assigned to receive either PP (n = 72) or TDR (n = 80). Complete clinical and radiological follow up was obtained in 122 patients. All fractures united. The mean palmar tilt was 2.2degree for palmar plating and 2.9degree for intramedullary nailing. Significant differences within groups (p < 0.05, students-t-test, posthoc: Bonferroni) were recorded for time for surgery (Targon DR: 41+/-21 min; 2.4mm plate: 51+/-18 min) for x-ray time (Targon DR: 1.2+/-0.3 min; 2.4mm plate: 0.9+/-0.2 min) as well as for early pain and motor function (Targon DR: VAS 1.2+/-0.2, Ext./Flex. 82%; 2.4mm plate: VAS 1.6+/-0.4, Ext./Flex. 76%). No differences were seen after two years. Osteopenic bone loss as measured by pQCT was seen in 73% of cases and qualitiy of life assessment (SF 36) revealed excellent social and physical function without differences within groups. Complications were CTS (4 PP, 2 TDR), temp. paresthesia of the superficial n. radialis branch (2 TDR), screw overlength (n = 2 PP, n = 2 TDR), intraarticular screw location (n = 2 PP) or extensor tendon affection (n = 4 PP).

This study evaluates efficacy and patterns of failure after SABR for synchronous early-stage NSCLC. Methods and Materials: From 2005 to 2015, patients presenting with >=2 synchronous NSCLC tumors (T1a-T2b) and receiving SABR to >=1 lesion were reviewed. The most common prescriptions were 50 Gy in 4 or 70 Gy in 10 fractions. Patients underwent multidisciplinary management with workup including chest computed tomography and positron emission tomography/computed tomography, plus brain imaging and endoscopic bronchial ultrasound for most patients to rule out mediastinal and distant disease. Synchronous lesions were defined as multiple ipsilateral or contralateral intrapulmonary lesions diagnosed within 6 months. Result(s): Of 912 patients treated with SABR for early-stage NSCLC at our institution, 82 (9%) presented with synchronous disease, with a total of 169 lesions. SABR was delivered to 142 lesions (84%), with 57 patients (69.5%) receiving SABR for all sites. Median overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) were 5.1 and 2.7 years, respectively. At a median follow-up of 58 months, OS was 67% and 52% at 3 and 5 years, and corresponding PFS was 47% and 29%. Thirty-nine patients (48%) had progression, with 21 (26%) experiencing distant failure, and intralobar recurrence was among the first failure for 15 patients (18%). Of the 142 SABR-treated sites, these included 6 in-field (4%) and 4 marginal (3%) recurrences. There were no grade >=3 adverse events. Among patients receiving SABR for all sites, there were no differences in OS (P = .946), PFS (P = .980), local control (P = .683), regional and distant control (P = .656), or toxicity (P = .791). On multivariable analysis, ipsilateral synchronous disease was associated with greater regional and distant failure (hazard ratio, 2.691; P = .025). Conclusion(s): Synchronous NSCLC can be managed with definitive local therapy. With high control rates and favorable outcomes, SABR is an effective and feasible treatment for synchronous early-stage NSCLC.Copyright © 2020 Elsevier Inc.",Excluded
2025,"Swimming kinematics and respiratory behaviour of Xenopus laevis larvae raised in altered gravity We examined the respiratory behaviours and swimming kinematics of Xenopus laevis tadpoles hatched in microgravity (Space Shuttle), simulated microgravity (clinostat) and hypergravity (3 g centrifuge). All observations were made in the normal 1 g environment. Previous research has shown that X. laevis raised in microgravity exhibit abnormalities in their lungs and vestibular system upon return to 1 g. The tadpoles raised in true microgravity exhibited a significantly lower tailbeat frequency than onboard 1 g centrifuge controls on the day of landing (day0), but this behaviour normalized within 9 days. The two groups did not differ significantly in buccal pumping rates. Altered buoyancy in the space-flight microgravity tadpoles was indicated by an increased swimming angle on the day after landing (day1). Tadpoles raised in simulated microgravity differed to a greater extent in swimming behaviours from their 1 g controls. The tadpoles raised in hypergravity showed no substantive effects on the development of swimming or respiratory behaviours, except swimming angle. Together, these results show that microgravity has a transient effect on the development of locomotion in X. laevis tadpoles, most notably on swimming angle, indicative of stunted lung development. On the basis of the behaviours we studied, there is no indication of neuromuscular retardation in amphibians associated with embryogenesis in microgravity.",Excluded

The objective of this study is to compare radiation exposure in invasive cardiologic procedures using the transradial and transfemoral approaches. Method(s): Prospective cohort study including patients undergoing diagnostic cardiac catheterization or percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) between August 2010 and December 2011. Clinical, angiographic and radiation exposure characteristics were recorded in a dedicated database. Patients were analyzed according to the access route: femoral or radial. Result(s): Of the 1,197 patients included in the study, 782 were submitted to procedures using the femoral access and 415 using the radial access. There was a lower prevalence of females (36.2% vs. 45.6%; P < 0.01), previous coronary artery bypass graft surgery (4% vs. 12.7%; P < 0.01) and severe valvular heart disease (0.3% vs. 1.4%; P = 0.07) in the radial group.

3390,"Rationale and design of the Japan molecular epidemiology for lung cancer study We present the rationale for the Japan Molecular Epidemiology for Lung Cancer study designed to elucidate molecular mechanisms of carcinogenesis in smokers and never-smokers with non-small-cell lung cancer. This prospective, ongoing, multicenter study is being conducted nationwide in Japan. Although there is no doubt that active smoking is the major cause of lung cancer, the contribution of other possible factors, including environmental tobacco or wood smoke, human papilloma virus, radon, occupational exposures, and genetic susceptibility, is highly likely, based on studies of never-smokers with non-small-cell lung cancer. Because of the predominance of women in the never-smoker subgroup, the role of female hormones in lung cancer development has also been considered. We hypothesize that driver mutations, which are critical for the development of lung cancer, are triggered by the environmental factors with or without the influence of the hormone. The SWOG-led intergroup molecular epidemiology study S0424 was conducted to focus on these issues by using a detailed questionnaire and specimen collection in statistically significant cohorts of smokers and never-smokers from both sexes. The Japan Molecular Epidemiology for Lung Cancer study follows and extends the S0424 molecular epidemiology concept in principle by using a similar approach that will facilitate future comparisons between the studies but with a greater focus on more recently defined driver mutations and broad genomic sequencing.

Within the cohort, mortality and incidence from both leukaemia excluding CLL and the grouping of all malignant neoplasms excluding leukaemia increased to a statistically significant extent with increasing radiation dose. Estimates of the trend in risk with dose were similar to those for the Japanese A-bomb survivors, with 90% confidence intervals that excluded both risks more than 2-3 times greater than the A-bomb values and no raised risk. Some evidence of an increasing trend with dose in mortality from all circulatory diseases may, at least partly, be due to confounding by smoking. This analysis provides the most precise estimates to date of mortality and cancer risks following occupational radiation exposure and strengthens the evidence for raised risks from these exposures. The cancer risk estimates are consistent with values used to set radiation protection standards.",Included
1800,"Diagnosing Fish Bone and Chicken Bone Impactions in the Emergency Department Setting: Measuring the System Utility of the Plain Film Screen OBJECTIVES: In the emergency department, fish and chicken bone impactions are typically evaluated with screening x-rays. We sought to determine whether this modality ultimately improves system outcomes, including length of stay (LOS), cost, and radiation dosage., METHODS: We reviewed patients >= 18 years old presenting to an urban academic emergency department over a 4-year period who received a screening soft-tissue x-ray to determine the presence of a retained fish or chicken bone. We calculated the diagnostic accuracy of x-ray and computed tomography (CT) evaluations, respectively, in addition to system outcomes., RESULTS: Twenty-seven of the 78 patients included for analysis were ultimately positive for bone impaction. Initial x-ray interpretations demonstrated a sensitivity of 24.0% (95% CI, 9.4%-45.1%) and a specificity of 90.0% (95% CI, 78.2%-96.7%). However, initial CT interpretation (ie, a preliminary read from on-call residents) demonstrated a sensitivity of 75% (95% CI, 19.4%-99.4%) and a specificity of 100% (95% CI, 59.0%-100%). LOS, cost, and radiation dosage were not significantly different between patients who ultimately had true bone impactions and those who did not (P > .05)., CONCLUSIONS: X-rays are poor screening tools in determining fish or chicken bone impactions with poor diagnostic and system utility. Further studies should be performed to evaluate the role of a low-radiation CT screen. Copyright © The Author(s) 2015.",Excluded
168,"Optimal adjuvant radiotherapy dose for stage I, II or III Merkel cell carcinoma: an analysis of the National Cancer Database BACKGROUND: We performed an analysis of the National Cancer Database to determine optimal doses of conventionally-fractionated adjuvant radiotherapy for patients with stage I/II or III Merkel cell carcinoma., METHODS: The cohort included 2735 patients with resected Merkel cell carcinoma of the head and neck, trunk or extremities receiving radiotherapy. Exclusion criteria included doses of radiotherapy <30 or >80 Gy, or dose per fraction >200 or <180 cGy. Recursive partitioning analysis and spline models were used to select dose thresholds. Multivariable Cox regression was performed to validate thresholds with respect to overall survival., RESULTS: Recursive partitioning analysis models defined a threshold of 57 Gy for stage I/II Merkel cell carcinoma, above which 3-year overall survival rate was decreased (P < 0.0001). The 3-year overall survival rate for patients receiving 50.0-57.0 Gy (81.2%) was greater compared to doses of 30.0-49.9 Gy (75.3%) or >57.0 Gy (70%, P < 0.0001). Doses > 57.0 Gy were associated with an increased hazard of death (1.31, confidence interval 1.07-1.60) with respect to doses of 50.0-57.0 Gy. Doses < 50.0 Gy for stage III Merkel cell carcinoma were associated with worsened 3-year overall survival (P < 0.0001) and increased hazard of death (2.01, confidence interval 1.43-2.82) with respect to doses between 50.0 and 57.0 Gy., CONCLUSIONS: Our results support doses of 50-57 Gy for most patients with stage I/II Merkel cell carcinoma receiving conventionally-fractionated adjuvant radiotherapy. In contrast to a prior National Cancer Database analysis, our results suggest doses >= 50 Gy should be strongly considered for patients with stage III Merkel cell carcinoma regardless of anatomic subsite.

975,"Long-term in vitro and in vivo effects of gamma-irradiated BCG on innate and adaptive immunity BCG vaccination is associated with a reduced mortality from nonmycobacterial infections. This is likely to be mediated by a combination of innate-immune memory (trained immunity"") and heterologous effects on adaptive immunity. As such, BCG could be used to boost host immunity but not in immunocompromised hosts, as it is a live, attenuated vaccine. Therefore, we assessed whether killed gammaBCG has similar potentiating effects. In an in vitro model of trained immunity, human monocytes were incubated with gammaBCG for 24 h and restimulated after 6 d. Cytokine production and the role of pattern recognition receptors and histone methylation markers were assessed. The in vivo effects of gammaBCG vaccination were studied in a proof-of-principle trial in 15 healthy volunteers. gammaBCG induced trained immunity in vitro via the NOD2 receptor pathway and up-regulation of H3K4me3 histone methylation. However, these effects were less strong than those induced by live BCG. gammaBCG vaccination in volunteers had only minimal effects on innate immunity, whereas a significant increase in heterologous Th1/Th17 immunity was observed. Our results indicate that gammaBCG induces long-term training of innate immunity in vitro. In vivo, gammaBCG induces mainly heterologous effects on the adaptive-immune system, whereas effects on innate cytokine production are limited. Copyright © Society for Leukocyte Biology.""",Excluded
2457,"Influence of nerve radiation dose in the incidence of trigeminal dysfunction after trigeminal neuralgia radiosurgery OBJECTIVE: The authors conducted a comparative study to analyze dosimetry and results to understand the significant difference in the rate of trigeminal dysfunction after gamma knife radiosurgery for trigeminal neuralgia between two centers using the same target., METHODS: The data of 358 patients (109 patients from Brussels and 259 patients from Marseilles) were analyzed. Three different dosimetric strategies were found: treatment with less than 90 Gy and no selective beam channel blocking (Group 1; patients from Marseilles only), treatment with 90 Gy and no selective beam channel blocking (Group 2; patients from Brussels and Marseilles), or treatment with 90 Gy and use of selective beam channel blocking (Group 3; patients from Brussels only)., RESULTS: The prescription dose and the use of selective beam channel blocking have been significantly associated with a higher energy received by the retrogasserian trigeminal nerve root. The different radiation dose delivered to the nerve root in these three groups of patients was significantly associated with the incidence of mild (15, 21, and 49% for Groups 1, 2, and 3, respectively) and bothersome (1.4, 2.4, and 10% for Groups 1, 2, and 3, respectively) trigeminal dysfunction. The good and excellent rates of pain relief were 81 and 66%, respectively, for Group 1, 85 and 77%, respectively, for Group 2, and 90 and 84%, respectively, for Group 3, and were also related to the amount of energy received by nerve root volume., CONCLUSION: Using a similar target, the incidence of trigeminal dysfunction and the pain relief rate can vary according to the radiation energy received by the retrogasserian part of the trigeminal nerve root. The prescription dose and the use of beam channel blocking modify the integrated dose delivered to the nerve and may contribute to the different rates of trigeminal numbness and pain outcome. The radiobiological effect of gamma knife radiosurgery may be related to the energy delivered to nerve root volume, rather than to the maximal dose delivered.",Excluded

2604,"Comparative efficacy of repetitive nerve stimulation, exercise, and cold in differentiating myotonic disorders The decremental response of the compound muscle action potential (CMAP) to provocative tests is not characterized in genetically verified myotonic disorders. We therefore studied the relationship between decremental responses and mutation type in 10 patients with recessive myotonia congenita (rMC), two with paramyotonia congenita (PMC), nine with myotonic dystrophy type 1 (DM1), four with DM2, and 14 healthy people. CMAPs were measured at rest, just after a short exercise test (SET), and during short, 5- and 10-HZ, repetitive nerve stimulation (RNS) trains at 32 degrees C and at 20 degrees C. The degree of decrement was not related to the severity of clinical myotonia. Controls and PMC patients had similar responses when warm, but with cooling PMC patients had a persistent decrement of CMAPs. In the rMC patients the decremental responses were related to the type of mutation of the CLCN1 gene, as a decrement was encountered in the T268M, R894X, IVS17+1 G>T, K248X, and 2149 del G, but not with the IVS1+3 A>T, F167L, or dominant A313T mutations. In DM1 patients there was no relationship between decrement and CTG repeats. The degree of partial inexcitability in myotonic muscle membrane therefore depends on the mutation type rather than degree of clinical myotonia. RNS at 10 HZ is more sensitive than SET for demonstrating abnormalities in rMC patients when warm; differences are less marked when cold, which is useful to diagnose PMC. Provocative tests are therefore useful in myotonias to demonstrate muscle inexcitability, which depends on the chloride or sodium channelopathy.",Excluded

Multidimensional analysis by anatomoclinical factors and role of irradiation] Pre- or postoperative radiation therapy reduces the incidence of local recurrence after surgical treatment of rectal carcinoma. Factors related to local recurrence were analyzed retrospectively by uni- and multivariate analysis. One hundred and fifty-five patients (mean age: 65 years) were operated on with curative intent between 1967 and 1984. Ninety-four patients (46 patients having abdominoperineal resections (APR), and 48 having anterior resections) did not receive radiation therapy. Sixty-one patients had preoperative radiation therapy followed by APR in 59 cases. Univariate analysis showed that the risk of local recurrence increased significantly with male sex (p less than 0.006), positive lymph nodes (p less than 0.01), vascular invasion (p less than 0.02), and Astler-Coller classification (p less than 0.05). Tumor located at less than 5 cm from the anal verge was significantly related to recurrence only in patients not receiving radiation therapy (p less than 0.02). Multivariate analysis including therapeutic modalities showed that local recurrence was significantly related with male sex (p less than 0.02), positive lymph nodes (p less than 0.01), and distance to anal verge (p less than 0.01). The beneficial role of radiation therapy appeared only for tumors located 5 cm or less from the anal verge. Prognostic scores were established using these variables and the effect of irradiation was evaluated according to these scores. Radiation therapy significatively reduced the risk of local recurrence in low-risk patients, i.e., female with low-lying tumor and with negative lymph nodes (p less than 0.03).

141,"Quality of Life, Behaviour and Attitudes towards Actinic Keratosis in Spain: The PIQA Study OBJECTIVE: This study was aimed to examine patients' knowledge, behaviours and attitudes regarding actinic keratosis (AK) lesions and the impact of the disease on patients' quality of life (QoL)., METHODS: Observational study of patients with AK lesions in Spain. QoL was evaluated with the validated version of Spanish AKQoL questionnaire. Skin self-examination, sun-exposure, habits and attitudes towards AK's treatment were recorded using different questionnaires. The adherence was assessed by means of the Morisky-Green test. Among other variables, QoL and adherence to treatment were compared by using Pearson's chi2 test and one-way ANOVA tests. Inferential analysis regarding such factors and length of treatment were also performed., RESULTS: A total of 1240 patients (73.6 [10.5] years old) were recruited. Overall, patients that showed higher levels of concern were also showed a higher impairment on QoL. AK had greater effects on women's QoL and those who performed skin self-examination, think that AK is a disease and/or believe that moisturizers can prevent skin aging (P<.05). Adherence and length of treatment were strongly related, since patients with treatments intended for <1week were more likely to show good adherence and complete remission of AK (Odds Ratio [95%CI]: 6.25 [4.55-8.33] and 2.63 [1.96-3.45]), respectively)., CONCLUSIONS: Concerns due to AK are mainly related to sex and to the consideration of AK as a disease. More concerned patients tend to have lower QoL and good adherence to treatment. Short length of treatment was associated with better adherence and complete remission of AK lesions.

2652,"Implications of somatic mutations in the AML1 gene in radiation-associated and therapy-related myelodysplastic syndrome/acute myeloid leukemia Somatically acquired point mutations of AML1/RUNX1 gene have been recently identified in rare cases of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS). Moreover, germ line mutations of AML1 were found in an autosomal dominant disease, familial platelet disorder with predisposition to AML (FPD/AML), suggesting that AML1 mutants, as well as AML1 chimeras, contribute to the transformation of hematopoietic progenitors. In this report, we showed that AML1 point mutations were found in 6 (46%) of 13 MDS patients among atomic bomb (A-bomb) survivors in Hiroshima. Unlike acute or chronic leukemia patients among A-bomb survivors, MDS patients exposed relatively low-dose radiation and developed the disease after a long latency period. AML1 mutations also were found in 5 (38%) of 13 therapy-related AML/MDS patients who were treated with alkylating agents with or without local radiation therapy. In contrast, frequency of AML1 mutation in sporadic MDS patients was 2.7% (2 of 74). Among AML1 mutations identified in this study, truncated-type mutants lost DNA binding potential and trans-activation activity. All missense mutations with one exception (Gly42Arg) lacked DNA binding ability and down-regulated the trans-activation potential of wild-type AML1 in a dominant-negative fashion. The Gly42Arg mutation that was shared by 2 patients bound DNA even more avidly than wild-type AML1 and enhanced the trans-activation potential of normal AML1. These results suggest that AML1 point mutations are related to low-dose radiation or alkylating agents and play a role distinct from that of leukemogenic chimeras as a result of chromosomal translocations caused by sublethal radiation or topoisomerase II inhibitors.",Excluded
2673,"Clinicopathological characteristics of patients with unexpected pathological N1 and N2 lung cancer Background: Although positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) seems to be able to provide accurate information of lymph nodes status in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients, we sometimes experience surgical cases with unexpected lymph nodes metastasis. The objective of this study is to demonstrate clinicopathological characteristics of patients with unexpected pathological (p) N1 and N2 NSCLC. Method(s): All patients with lung cancer underwent enhanced CT of the chest and PET/CT preoperatively for evaluating of lymph node status. Mediastinoscopy or EBUS-TBNA was not routinely performed. Unexpected pN1 and pN2 diseases were defined as surgical cases which were proved to have hilar or mediastinal lymph nodes metastasis postoperatively in spite of negative 18-fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose (FDG) uptake in hilar or mediastinal lymph nodes on preoperative PET/CT. We retrospectively reviewed clinical features of these patients and analyze predictive factors for these unexpected diseases. Result(s): Between January 2007 and December 2012, 533 patients with lung cancer underwent (surgical resection at our institution. Among them, we reviewed 182 patients who had available preoperative PET/CT data and underwent a curative-intent operation with systematic or selective lymph node dissection. One hundred fiftyone patients (83%) had lung cancer with expected lymph node status, whereas, 31 patients (17%) were found to have lung cancer with unexpected lymph nodes metastasis, consisting of 12 (39%) unexpected pN1 and 19 (61%) unexpected pN2 diseases. There were 16 men and 15 women with a median age of 67 years. Seventeen patients were current- or past- smokers, and 14 were neversmokers. Tumor size ranged from 12 to 52 mm, and pathological T factor was pT1a in 3, pT1b in 5, pT2a in 19, pT2b in 3, and pT3 in 1. Histological type of the primary tumor were adenocarcinoma in 28 (90%), squamous cell carcinoma in 2, and large cell carcinoma in 1. Among 28 adenocarcinomas, the most common predominant subtype was papillary (20 patients; 71%), followed by acinar (5 patients), solid with mucin, micropapillary, and invasive mucinous (one patient, respectively). Of these patients, 7 patients had micropapillary component in varying proportions in their tumors. EGFR gene mutation status was available in 22 patients, and of these, 12 patients (55%) had tumors with EGFR gene mutation, consisting of exon 19 deletion in 5, exon 21 point mutation in 5, and other minor mutation in 1. In univariate analysis, tumor size (> 3cm), pleural, and lymphatic invasion were significant predictive factors for unexpected pN1 and pN2 diseases. Only in 151 adenocarcinomas, papillary predomiant tumor and having micropapillary component were significant predictive factors for unexpected lymph node metastasis. Conclusion(s): We should take care that false-negative rate is relatively high on preoperative PET/CT for lymph node status in NSCLC. Histological findings of the primary tumor are often important because they can provide predictive information for lymph nodes status even if there is no FDG uptake in regional lymph nodes on preoperative PET/CT.

1398,"Dynamic CTA in Native Kidneys Using a Multiphase CT Protocol-Potential of Significant Reduction of Contrast Medium RATIONALE AND OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to assess an optimized renal multiphase computed tomography angiography (MP-CTA) protocol regarding reduction of contrast volume., MATERIALS AND METHODS: Thirty patients underwent MP-CTA (12 phases, every 3.5 seconds, 80 kV/120 mAs) using 30 mL of contrast medium. The quality of MP-CTA was assessed quantitatively measuring vessel attenuation, image noise, and contrast-to-noise ratio. MP-CTA was evaluated qualitatively regarding depiction of vessels, cortex differentiation, and motion artifacts (grades 1-4, 1 = best). Mean effective radiation dose was registered. Results were compared to standard renal computed tomography angiography (CTA) (80 mL). Student t test was applied, if variables followed normal distribution. For other variables, nonparametric Mann-Whitney U test was used., RESULTS: All acquisitions were successfully performed, and no patient had to be excluded from the study. MP-CTA enabled high attenuation (aorta: 503 +/- 91 HU, renal arteries: 450 +/- 73 HU/456 +/- 72 HU) at adequate image noise (13.7 +/- 1.5) and good contrast-to-noise ratio (34.2 +/- 10.2). Good attenuation of renal veins was observed (286 +/- 43 HU/282 +/- 42 HU). Arterial enhancement was significantly higher compared to renal CTA (aorta: 396 +/- 90 HU, renal arteries: 331 +/- 74 HU/333 +/- 80 HU; P < .001). MP-CTA protocol enabled good image quality of renal arteries (1.5 +/- 0.6) and veins (1.7 +/- 0.6). Cortex differentiation and motion artifacts were ranked 1.8 +/- 0.8 and 1.6 +/- 0.8. The mean effective radiation dose was 9 mSv (MP-CTA)., CONCLUSIONS: Compared to standard renal CTA, the renal MP-CTA enabled the significant reduction of contrast volume and simultaneously provided a significantly higher arterial attenuation.

Twelve dogs were enrolled, according to stage, in two groups: group 1, TCC confined to the urinary tract; group 2, TCC with metastasis. The planning target volume dose was tailored from 36 to 42 Gy in 6 fractions. All dogs were prescribed piroxicam and radiosensitizing carboplatin, and six received chemotherapy after radiotherapy. Serial follow-ups with computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging were performed. Disease control and toxicity effects were evaluated according to the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors and Veterinary Radiation Therapy Oncology Group criteria. The treatment was well tolerated, and no high-grade side effects were reported. The median overall survival times for groups 1 and 2 were 1,230 and 150 days, respectively. A considerable percentage of patients in group1 (50%) were still alive at the time of writing this paper, and a longer follow-up could enable a more accurate survival analysis. This preliminary analysis shows that VMAT applied to the WPRT with MLSIB is an effective and safe option for dogs with lower urinary TCC, although the presence of metastases worsens the prognosis.Copyright © 2021 The Japanese Society of Veterinary Science.",Excluded

During tissue regeneration, collagen level increases gradually and therefore, monitoring of such changes in vivo by laser induced fluorescence was the main objective behind the present study. In order to accomplish this, 15 mm diameter excisional wounds were created on six to eight week old Swiss albino mice. The collagen deposition accelerated upon irradiation of single exposure of 2 J/cm2 He-Ne laser dose immediately after wounding was recorded by laser induced autofluorescence in vivo along with un-illuminated and un-wounded controls. Autofluorescence spectra were recorded for each animal of the experimental groups on 0, 5, 10, 30, 45 and 60 days post-wounding, by exciting the granulation tissue/skin with 325 nm He-Cd laser. The variations in the average collagen intensities from the granulation tissue/skin of mice were inspected as a function of age and gender. Further, the spectral findings of the collagen synthesis in wound granulation tissue/un-wounded skin tissues were validated by Picro-Sirius red- polarized light microscopy in a blinded manner through image analysis of the respective collagen birefringence. The in vivo autofluorescence studies have shown a significant increase in collagen synthesis in laser treated animals as compared to the un-illuminated controls. Image analysis of the collagen birefringence further authenticated the ability of autofluorescence in the objective monitoring of collagen in vivo.

There were 19 men and 18 women with a mean age of 67.6+/-11.7 (SD) years (range: 36-85 years) For each patient, volume CT dose index (CTDIvol), size-specific dose estimates (SSDE) and signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) were evaluated at each anatomic level (lung, breast, liver and pelvis area) for each protocol. Two radiologists assessed independently image quality, artifacts and diagnostic confidence., RESULTS: The radiation dose decreased significantly using Liver DRI compared to standard automatic exposure control on the total scan length, lung, breast and pelvis area, with a significant CTDIvol reduction of 27% (P=0.0001), 23% (P=0.0002), 24% (P=0.0002) and 31% (P=0.0001), respectively; and a significant SSDE reduction of 23% (P=0.0001), 28% (P=0.0001), 23% (P=0.0002) and 29% (P=0.0001), respectively. No significant SNR reductions were observed in all measured tissues at the level of the aortic arch, celiac trunk and iliac bifurcation, except in the muscle (P=0.0013) and fat tissue (P=0.0052) at the level of the ureteral meatus. No significant differences were noted between both protocols in overall image quality, artifacts and diagnostic confidence with an excellent inter observer agreement between radiologists (Kappa values of 0.83, 0.85 and 0.88, respectively)., CONCLUSION: Liver DRI organ based dose modulation technique allows significant dose reduction compared to standard automatic exposure control while preserving diagnostic image quality in all thoraco-abdominopelvic areas.

The aim of the study was to analyze the response of antioxidant systems through the determination of the antioxidant markers in the blood of patients exposed to oxidative stress resulting from the routine HRCT examination of the chest. Blood of 35 people aged 60.77 +/- 10.81 taken before and at four time points after the examination constituted the test material. The determination of the total antioxidant capacity expressed as ferric reducing ability of plasma (FRAP) and ferric reducing antioxidant activity and ascorbic acid concentration (FRASC) were performed together with an examination of catalase activity and the concentration of the reduced glutathione. The organism's response to ionizing radiation was associated with a significant decrease in the antioxidant markers' levels at all time-points and showed a significant negative correlation depending on the radiation dose. Visible down-regulation of these markers is a response to increased oxidative stress. In light of the obtained results, the measurement of the selected markers of antioxidant defense may be a useful parameter of oxidative stress caused by ionizing radiation.",Excluded
3444,"Image quality and radiation dose of dual-energy CT of the head and neck compared with a standard 120-kVp acquisition BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: DECT offers additional image datasets with potential benefits, but its use for H&N imaging is not justified unless image quality is preserved without increased radiation dose. The aim of this work was to compare image quality and radiation dose between a DE-derived WA image dataset and a standard SECT acquisition of the H&N. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Thirty-two patients underwent DECT of the H&N (tube voltages 80 and Sn140 kVp) and were compared with the last 32 patients who underwent standard SECT (120 kVp) on the same dual-source scanner. WA images from the 2 DE tubes were compared with images obtained with an SE mode. Radiation doses and attenuation measurements of the internal jugular vein, submandibular gland, and sternomastoid and tongue muscles were compared. Objective image noise was compared at 5 anatomic levels. Two blinded readers compared subjective image quality by using 5-point grading scales. RESULT(S): CTDIvol was 12% lower with DE than with SECT, a difference of 1.5 mGy, (P < .0001). Objective noise was not significantly different between DE and SECT at any of the anatomic levels (P > .05). No significant differences in attenuation measurements were observed between DE and SECT (P > .05). No significant differences in subjective image quality scores were observed between DE and SECT at any of the 5 anatomic levels (P > .05). CONCLUSION(S): DE-derived WA images of the H&N are equivalent to standard SE acquisitions and thus can be used for routine diagnostic purposes. Multiple additional image datasets can be obtained with no radiation dose penalty.",Excluded
2703,"Treatment of Recurrent Bronchial Carcinoma: The Role of High-Dose-Rate Endoluminal Brachytherapy Purpose: This study's aim was to assess outcome and toxicity of high-dose-rate endoluminal brachytherapy (HDREB) for recurrent bronchial carcinoma. Methods and Materials: From 1987 to 2005, 41 patients were treated with HDREB for symptomatic recurrent bronchial carcinoma. All patients had previously undergone external beam radiotherapy (EBRT) with a median dose of 56 Gy (range, 30-70 Gy). The median HDREB dose applied was 15 Gy (range, 5-29 Gy). The median time interval between primary EBRT and reirradiation was 9 months (range, 2-54 months). Result(s): After a median follow-up of 6.7 months, the 6-, 12-, and 24-month overall survival rates were 58%, 18%, and 7%, respectively. The median overall survival time was 6.7 months. Local remission was achieved in 73% of patients (n = 30). A total of 24% of patients (n = 10) showed no response or progressive disease within 8 weeks after treatment. In 1 patient, treatment response was not documented. The 6-, 12-, and 24-month local control rates were 38%, 17%, and 3%, respectively. The median local progression-free survival time was 4 months (range, 1-23 months). Prognostic factors were a total dose of >=15 Gy of HDREB (p = 0.029) and a Karnofsky performance score of >=80% (p = 0.0012). The cause of death was locoregional progression in 27% of patients (n = 11), distant metastases in 24% of patients (n = 10), fatal hemorrhage in 15% of patients (n = 6), and other causes in 29% of patients (n = 12). None of the patients with locally controlled disease showed grade 3 or 4 late effects. Conclusion(s): Palliative treatment of symptomatic, locally recurrent bronchial carcinoma with HDREB can effectively relieve symptoms in the majority of patients while causing only few complications. Still, time to progression is short. © 2010 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.",Excluded

591,"Predictors of pulmonary toxicity in limited stage small cell lung cancer patients treated with induction chemotherapy followed by concurrent platinum-based chemotherapy and 70Gy daily radiotherapy: CALGB 30904 Introduction: Standard therapy for limited stage small cell lung cancer (L-SCLC) is concurrent chemotherapy and radiotherapy followed by prophylactic cranial radiotherapy. Predictors of post chemoradiotherapy pulmonary toxicity in limited stage (LS) small cell lung cancer (SCLC) patients are not well defined. Current guidelines are derived from non-small cell lung cancer regimens, and do not account for the unique biology of this disease. Therefore, we analyzed patients on three consecutive CALGB LS-SCLC trials treated with concurrent chemotherapy and daily high dose radiotherapy (70. Gy) to determine patient and treatment related factors predicting for post-treatment pulmonary toxicity. Method(s): Patients treated on CALGB protocols 39808, 30002, 30206 investigating two cycles of chemotherapy followed by concurrent chemotherapy and 70. Gy daily thoracic radiation therapy were pooled. Patient, tumor, and treatment related factors were evaluated to determine predictors of grade 3-5 pulmonary toxicities after concurrent chemoradiotherapy. Result(s): 100 patients were included. No patient experienced grade 4-5 post-treatment pulmonary toxicity. Patients who experienced post-treatment pulmonary toxicity were more likely to be older (median age 69 vs 60, p= 0.09) and have smaller total lung volumes (2565 cc vs 3530 cc, p= 0.05).). Furthermore, exposure of larger volumes of lung to lower (median V5. = 70%, p= 0.09, median V10. = 63%, p= 0.07), intermediate (median V20. = 50, p= 0.04) and high (median V60. = 25%, p= 0.01) doses of radiation were all associated with post-treatment grade 3 pulmonary toxicity, as was a larger mean lung radiation dose (median 31. Gy) p= 0.019. Conclusion(s): Post-treatment pulmonary toxicity following the completion of 2 cycles of chemotherapy followed by concurrent chemotherapy and high dose daily radiation therapy was uncommon. Care should be taken to minimize mean lung radiation exposure, as well as volumes of low, intermediate and high doses of radiation. © 2013 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.",Excluded
1122,"In vitro radiosensitivity of skin fibroblasts can identify a group of radiotherapy patients having developed complications in a variety of normal tissues Purpose. - A retrospective study of the in vitro radiosensitivity of skin fibroblasts derived from two groups of patients treated by definitive radiotherapy for a variety of tumors who either displayed or did not display severe complications. Patients and methods. - Seven radiotherapy patients were selected: three were treated for head and neck, prostate and non-Hodgkin lymphoma tumors, and did not develop any significant complications (control group); four patients were treated for bladder, thyroid, head and neck and anal canal tumors and developed serious acute and especially late reactions (hypersensitive group). Primary cell cultures of skin fibroblasts were established and their radiosensitivity studied by the clonogenic assay after exposing to single radiation doses ranging between 1 and 8 Gy. Results. - The survival fraction at 2 Gy (SF2) ranged from 0.27 to 0.38, with a mean of 0.33 for the control group, and from 0.10 to 0.20 with a mean of 0.17 for the hypersensitive group. The Mann-Whitney non-parametric test showed that the difference between the two means was statistically significant (p = 0.03). Conclusion. - The data are in favor of a correlation between the radiosensitivity of patients' fibroblasts and the reactions of different normal tissues to radiotherapy. This association supports the use of the clonogenic survival, or a surrogate test, as a predictive assay. The multiplicity of normal tissues and organs implicated in this association suggests the existence of genetic factors that determine, at least in part, the radiosensitivity of target cells involved in the expression of normal tissues complications following radiotherapy.",Excluded
165,"Abscopal effect of boron neutron capture therapy (BNCT): proof of principle in an experimental model of colon cancer The aim of the present study was to evaluate, for the first time, the abscopal effect of boron neutron capture therapy (BNCT). Twenty-six BDIX rats were inoculated subcutaneously with 1 x 106 DHD/K12/TRb syngeneic colon cancer cells in the right hind flank. Three weeks post-inoculation, the right leg of 12 rats bearing the tumor nodule was treated with BPA-BNCT (BPA-Boronophenylalanine) at the RA-3 nuclear reactor located in Buenos Aires, Argentina, at an absorbed dose of 7.5 Gy to skin as the dose-limiting tissue. The remaining group of 14 tumor-bearing rats were left untreated and used as control. Two weeks post-BNCT, 1 x 106 DHD/K12/TRb cells were injected subcutaneously in the contralateral left hind flank of each of the 26 BDIX rats. Tumor volume in both legs was measured weekly for 7 weeks to determine response to BNCT in the right leg and to assess a potential influence of BNCT in the right leg on tumor development in the left leg. Within the BNCT group, a statistically significant reduction was observed in contralateral left tumor volume in animals whose right leg tumor responded to BNCT (post-treatment/pre-treatment tumor volume <1) versus animals who failed to respond (post/pre >=1), i.e., 13 +/- 15 vs 271 +/- 128 mm3. In addition, a statistically significant reduction in contralateral left leg tumor volume was observed in BNCT-responsive animals (post/pre <1) vs untreated animals, i.e., 13 +/- 15 vs 254 +/- 251 mm3. The present study performed in a simple animal model provides proof of principle that the positive response of a tumor to BNCT is capable of inducing an abscopal effect.",Excluded
366,"A Pilot Study of Safer Radiation Dosage to the Heart and Its Subregions Background and Objectives: The real impact of ionizing radiation on the heart and poorer overall survival for patients with non small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) remains unclear. This study aims to determine the safe dose constraints to the heart's subregions that could prevent patients' early non-cancerous death and improve their quality of life. Methods and Materials: A retrospective cohort study was performed containing 51 consecutive patients diagnosed with stage III NSCLC and treated using 3D, Intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT), and Volumetric modulated arc therapy (VMAT) radiotherapy. For a dosimetric analysis, these structures were chosen: heart, heart base (HB), and region of great blood vessels (GBV). Dose-volume histograms (DVH) were recorded for all mentioned structures. Maximum and mean doses to the heart, HB, the muscle mass of the HB, and GBV were obtained. V10-V60 (%) parameters were calculated from the DVH. After performed statistical analysis, logistic regression models were created, and critical doses calculated. Result(s): The critical dose for developing a fatal endpoint for HB was 30.5 Gy, while for GBV, it was 46.3 Gy. Increasing the average dose to the HB or GBV by 1 Gy from the critical dose further increases the possibility of early death by 22.0% and 15.8%, respectively. Conclusion(s): We suggest that the non-canonical sub-regions of the heart (HB and GBV) should be considered during the planning stage. Additional constraints of the heart subregions should be chosen accordingly, and we propose that the mean doses to these regions be 30.5 Gy and 46.3 Gy, respectively, or less. Extrapolated DVH curves for both regions may be used during the planning stage with care.",Excluded
3078,"Delayed radiation necrosis of brain evaluated positron emission tomography In four patients highly suspected of having delayed radiation necrosis of the brain, regional cerebral blood flow and metabolism were studied by using positron emission tomography (PET) with the 15O-labelled gases, 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (18FDG). All four patients showed marked decreases in glucose and oxygen consumption in the lesion with that suspected pathology in comparison with those in normal brain parenchyma. Two of them were histologically proved to have radiation injuries (one was radiation necrosis and another was early delayed reactions). But one patient was histologically proved to have a recurrent tumor. Although metabolic study with PET using 18FDG is generally an excellent procedure for differentiation between radiation injuries and recurrent brain tumor, these results imply that in some cases the differential diagnosis is difficult even with 18FDG. The present study demonstrated considerably more pronounced reduction in the metabolism than the decrease of the blood flow in the lesion with radiation necrosis. This result would indicate that the primary effect causing the radiation necrosis is a direct effect of irradiation on neural tissue rather than the capillary damage.",Excluded
3000,"Hearing Assessment after Treatment of Nasopharyngeal Carcinoma with CRT and IMRT Techniques OBJECTIVES: This study analyzed the long-term hearing loss after treatment of primary nasopharyngeal carcinoma to elucidate its causal factors., METHODS: Ninety-two nasopharyngeal carcinoma patients were treated with radiotherapy or chemoradiotherapy. Pure tone audiometry was performed before the therapy and annually up to 9 years after completing treatment. The hearing thresholds were corrected for age-related deterioration and compared to the results without adjusting for age., RESULTS: The mean air and bone conduction threshold with and without correction for age-related deterioration differed significantly 2-9 years after completing radiotherapy (p < 0.05). The audiometry results with age correction showed a flattened configuration compared to the results without age correction. The total radiation dose and radiation modality showed a causal relationship with a greater incidence of hearing loss after therapy (p < 0.05). There was more deterioration in the air and bone hearing thresholds with conformal radiotherapy than intensity-modulated radiotherapy (p < 0.001). A radiation dose >72 cGy resulted in more severe hearing loss than <72 cGy (p < 0.05)., CONCLUSION: Hearing loss after completing therapy should be corrected for age-related hearing deterioration to reveal the true extent to which the loss is a therapeutic complication. Both the radiation modality used and the dose were significantly associated with hearing loss.",Excluded
2331,"Abdominal radiographs understimate the prevalence of paget's disease of bone in a fifht of patients Background The most frequent skeletal localizations of Paget's disease of bone (PDB) are the pelvis, lumbar spine and proximal femur. Thus, an x-ray including these locations, such as an abdominal radiograph, allows the identification of the disease with a high probability. However, according to previous studies, only 60 to 90% of the global skeletal affection by PDB is included in the area of an abdominal radiograph [1]. In order toknow with certainty the real prevalence of PDB in any population, usually assessed by abdominal radiographs, we need to know the percentage of patients with PDB without pagetic affection of bones included in an abdominal x-ray. Objectives To estimate the percentage of PBD patients without skeletal affection in the pelvis, lumbar spine and/or proximal femur to assess the underestimation of the prevalence of PDB assessed by abdominal radiographs. Methods Transversal descriptive study based on medical records of 602 patients from the Spanish National PBD Register [2]. We included consecutive patients with a skeletal radionuclide scintigraphy and alkaline phosphatase measurement in the year of the diagnosis. We excluded patients treated with bisphosphonates or calcitonin in the previous five years. A central lecture of scintigraphies was made by expert rheumatologists, who identified the pagetic bones included in an abdominal radiograph and in the whole skeleton. Results 214 (36%) bone scans were analyzed. There were not significant differences (p>0.25) between the included patients and patients from the Register in age, gender and time from diagnosis. The percentage of patients with PDB in the lumbar spine, pelvis and/or proximal femur was 80% (IC 95%: [74%>85%]), without differences by gender. This implies that 1/5 of patients are not diagnosed of PDB if only abdominal x-rays are analyzed. New PDB prevalence estimation in Spain is 1.2% (0.9%>1.6%), being 1.5% (1%>2.1%) in men and 1% (0.7%>1.5%) in women. Figure 1 shows the percentage of patients with pagetic involvement in each area.

675,"Modalities of surveillance in treated nasopharyngeal cancer OBJECTIVE: We sought to assess the efficacy of different modalities in the detection of disease during the early posttreatment period of nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC). STUDY DESIGN AND SETTING: We prospectively evaluated 57 patients with NPC who were treated with radiation. A postnasal space (PNS) biopsy, an endoscopic examination, and computed tomography (CT) scans were performed 4 months after treatment. RESULT(S): Four patients had evidence of disease in the PNS biopsy specimen. The sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values of the endoscopic examination were 75%, 94.3%, 50%, and 98%, respectively, while those of the CT scan were 50%, 49.1%, 6.9%, and 92.9%, respectively. CONCLUSION(S): In the early postradiation period for patients with NPC, an endoscopic examination is a suitable surveillance modality, but routine CT scanning has no added clinical benefit. SIGNIFICANCE: When an endoscopic examination of the PNS yields normal results, a biopsy is not necessary because the likelihood of disease is low.",Excluded

2313,"Organ doses, effective dose, and cancer risk from coronary CT angiography examinations OBJECTIVE. The purposes of this study were to determine organ and effective doses and to estimate the risk of exposure-induced cancer death (REID) associated with coronary CT angiography (CCTA) examinations. SUBJECTS AND METHODS. CCTA examinations were performed in three stages: calcium score, monitoring, and cardiac phases for all patients. Effective dose was calculated using two methods. The first was based on the scanner-derived dose-length product, and the second entailed use of an organ and effective dose calculator software application. Organ doses were calculated on the basis of the tissue weighting factors of International Commission on Radiation Protection report 103. REID values were assessed with a cancer risk estimator software application. RESULTS. The study included 185 patients (95 men, 90 women). For women, breast doses were high at 52.04 +/- 14.08 mGy. The mean effective dose in the women was greater than that in the men (24.05 vs 16.30 mSv, p < 0.05). The mean REID values in patients undergoing CCTA with a 64-MDCT scanner were 13.4 per 10,000 men (1 in 746) and 19.6 per 10,000 women (1 in 508). The REID values were considerably higher for the younger women. CONCLUSION. The results of this study will help referring physicians justify requesting CCTA examinations by considering their benefits for diagnosis on the one hand and awareness of the risk of radiation-induced cancer on the other. In the case of CCTA scans that are properly justified by clinical indication, patients and physicians should not be concerned about the radiation risks.Copyright © American Roentgen Ray Society.",Excluded

Patients and Methods: Fifty-seven patients with T1NOMO (70%) and T2N0M0 (30%) were included between August 2003 and September 2005 at seven different centers in Sweden, Norway, and Denmark and observed up to 36 months. SBRT was delivered with 15 Gy times three at the 67% isodose of the planning target volume. Result(s): Progression-free survival at 3 years was 52%. Overall- and cancer-specific survival at 1, 2, and 3 years was 86%, 65%, 60%, and 93%, 88%, 88%, respectively. There was no statistically significant difference in survival between patients with T1 or T2 tumors. At a median follow-up of 35 months (range, 4 to 47 months), 27 patients (47%) were deceased, seven as a result of lung cancer and 20 as a result of concurrent disease. Kaplan-Meier estimated local control at 3 years was 92%. Local relapse was observed in four patients (7%). Regional relapse was observed in three patients (5%). Nine patients (16%) developed distant metastases. The estimated risk of all failure (local, regional, or distant metastases) was increased in patients with T2 (41%) compared with those with T1 (18%) tumors (P = .027). Conclusion(s): With a 3-year local tumor control rate higher than 90% with limited toxicity, SBRT emerges as state-of-the-art treatment for medically inoperable stage I NSCLC and may even challenge surgery in operable instances. © 2009 by American Society of Clinical Oncology.",Excluded

The central HB tract (cHBT) was defined by a 15-mm expansion of the portal vein from the splenic confluence to the first bifurcation of left and right portal veins. Patients were censored for toxicity upon local progression or additional liver-directed therapy. HB toxicities were graded according to Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events version 4.0. To compare different SBRT fractionations, doses were converted to biologically effective doses (BED) by using the standard linear quadratic model alpha/beta = 10 (BED10)., RESULTS: Median follow-up was 12.7 months after SBRT. Median BED10 was 85.5 Gy (range: 37.5-151.2). The median number of fractions was 5 (range: 1-5), with 51 patients (53.1%) receiving 5 fractions and 29 patients (30.2%) receiving 3 fractions. In total, there were 23 (24.0%) grade 2+ and 18 (18.8%) grade 3+ HB toxicities. Nondosimetric factors predictive of grade 3+ HB toxicity included cholangiocarcinoma (CCA) histology (P<.0001), primary liver tumor (P=.0087), and biliary stent (P<.0001). Dosimetric parameters most predictive of grade 3+ HB toxicity were volume receiving above BED10 of 72 Gy (VBED1072) >= 21 cm(3) (relative risk [RR]: 11.6, P<.0001), VBED1066 >= 24 cm(3) (RR: 10.5, P<.0001), and mean BED10 (DmeanBED10) cHBT >=14 Gy (RR: 9.2, P<.0001), with VBED1072 and VBED1066 corresponding to V40 and V37.7 for 5 fractions and V33.8 and V32.0 for 3 fractions, respectively. VBED1072 >= 21 cm(3), VBED1066 >= 24 cm(3), and DmeanBED10 cHBT >=14 Gy were consistently predictive of grade 3+ toxicity on multivariate analysis., CONCLUSIONS: VBED1072, VBED1066, and DmeanBED10 to cHBT are associated with HB toxicity.

This study evaluated the utility of vertebral attenuation derived from low-dose chest computed tomography (LDCT) compared to dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA) for detecting bone fragility., METHODS: A total of 232 subjects (78 men and 154 women) aged above 50 years who underwent both LDCT and DXA within 30 days were evaluated. LDCT-measured bone attenuation in Hounsfield units (HU) of four vertebrae (T4, T7, T10, and L1) was evaluated using volumetric methods for correlation with DXA-measured bone mineral density (BMD) and for the diagnosis of compression fractures, osteoporosis, and low BMD (osteoporosis or osteopenia) in men and women, with DXA measurements as the reference standard., RESULTS: The average attenuation of the four vertebrae showed strong correlation with DXA-measured BMD of the lumbar spine (r = 0.726, p < 0.05). In receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) analyses, the area under the curve (AUC) across LDCT-measured thresholds of the average attenuation to distinguish compression fractures was 0.827, and a threshold of 129.5 HU yielded 90.9 % sensitivity and 64.4 % specificity.

By a conservative estimate, about three per cent of the pre-1987 cancer deaths of Hanford workers had occupational exposures to external radiation as the critical (induction) event. These radiogenic cancers were evenly distributed between five diagnostic groups, but as a result of there being much greater sensitivity to cancer induction by radiation"" after, rather than before, 50 years of age, they were concentrated among the cancers which proved fatal after 70 years of age. The reanalysis provides no support for the idea that radiation is more likely to cause leukemia than solid tumors, or the idea that there is reduced cancer effectiveness of radiation at low dose levels (dose rate effectiveness factor or DREF hypothesis), but the estimated proportion of radiogenic cancers was much higher for the 175 nonfatal cancers (which had other certified causes of death) than for the 1,732 fatal cases. Finally, according to the latest publication of the US Committee on Biological Effects of Ionizing Radiation (BEIR V), dose rate is more important than exposure age, and even a single exposure to 10 rem would only increase the normal cancer risk by four percent. Nevertheless, for all recorded exposures of Hanford workers, the estimated doubling dose was close to 26 rem; for exposures after 58 years, it was close to 5 rem, and for exposures after 62 years, it was less than 1 rem.""",Excluded

In this work, diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) was used to investigate WM changes following SRS. Fifteen patients with gliomas were enrolled, with prescription doses ranging 18-25 Gy. Patients were scanned with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) including DTI before and after SRS. Diffusion tensors were calculated and fiber tracking was performed. Non-irradiated WM volumes and irradiated WM volumes receiving >=12 Gy and >=5 Gy were contoured as volumes of interest (VOI). Apparent diffusion coefficient (), fractional anisotropy (FA) and number of fibers (NF) were calculated and assessed using the Wilcoxon signed-rank test. Compared with those of non-irradiated VOIs, FA and NF decreased considerably after two months of SRS in the irradiated WM VOIs. The variation in was however small and was not statistically significant. The preliminary results suggested that FA and NF might potentially be more sensitive indicators than in measuring radiation-induced WM changes and DTI could be a valuable tool to assess radiation-induced WM changes in SRS.

258,"Stimulus intensity affects early sensory processing: visual contrast modulates evoked gamma-band activity in human EEG We studied the effect of different contrast levels on the visual evoked gamma-band response (GBR) in order to investigate whether the GBR is modulated in a similar manner as previously reported for visual evoked potentials. Previous studies showed that the GBR can be modulated by individual characteristics (age) and experimental conditions (task difficulty, attention). However, stimulus properties, such as size and spatial frequency, also have a large impact on the GBR, which necessitates identification and control of relevant stimulus properties for optimal experimental setups. Twenty-one healthy participants were investigated during a forced-choice discrimination task. Sinusoidal gratings were presented at three contrast levels with a constant spatial frequency of 5 cycles per degree visual arc (cpd). The present data replicate the results reported for visual evoked potentials and exhibit a contrast dependent modulation of the GBR. Gamma activity is increased for higher contrast levels. These results demonstrate the importance of stimulus contrast for evoked gamma activity. Thus, it appears meaningful to control the contrast of stimuli in experiments investigating the role of gamma activity in perception and information processing.",Excluded

The payload, to be integrated inside the Space Shuttle middeck during transportation and inside the Express Rack in the ISS during experiment execution, was designed to function autonomously for more than 3 months and to involve crew only for maintenance activities. In its first mission, three wild type (Wt) and three transgenic male mice over-expressing pleiotrophin under the control of a bone-specific promoter (PTN-Tg) were housed in the MDS. At the time of launch, animals were 2-months old. MDS reached the ISS on board of Shuttle Discovery Flight 17A/STS-128 on August 28(th), 2009. MDS returned to Earth on November 27(th), 2009 with Shuttle Atlantis Flight ULF3/STS-129 after 91 days, performing the longest permanence of mice in space.

2565,"Imaging Findings Within the First 12 Months of Hepatocellular Carcinoma Treated With Stereotactic Body Radiation Therapy Purpose: To correlate the imaging findings of treated hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) after stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) with explant pathology and alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) response. Methods and Materials: From 2007 to 2015, of 146 patients treated with liver SBRT for Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer stage A hepatocellular carcinoma, 10 were identified with inclusion criteria and had regular interval follow-up magnetic resonance imaging/triple phase computed tomography and explant pathology or declining AFP values for radiology-pathology response correlation. Reference standards for successful response were >90% necrosis on explant pathology or pretreatment AFP >75 ng/mL normalizing to <10 ng/mL within 1 year after SBRT without other treatment. Subjects were treated with 24 to 50 Gy in 3 to 5 fractions. Multiphasic magnetic resonance imaging or computed tomography performed at 3, 6, 9, and 12 months after SBRT was compared with pretreatment imaging by 2 expert radiologists. Descriptive statistics were calculated. Result(s): There were 10 subjects with 10 treated HCCs, classified as 3 Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network (OPTN) 5a, 4 OPTN 5b, and 3 OPTN 5x. All had successfully treated HCCs, according to explant pathology or declining AFP. Four of 10 HCCs had persistent central arterial hyperenhancement 3 to 12 months after SBRT; persistent wash-out was common up to 12 months (9 of 10). Of 10 treated HCCs, 9 exhibited decreased size at 12 months. Liver parenchyma adjacent to the lesion showed early (3-6 months) hyperemia followed by late (6-12 months) capsular retraction and delayed enhancement. No patient had a significant decline in liver function. Conclusion(s): In the absence of increasing size, persistent central arterial hyperenhancement and wash-out can occur within the first 12 months after SBRT in successfully treated HCCs and may not represent residual viable tumor. Liver parenchyma adjacent to the treated lesion showed inflammation followed by fibrosis, without significant change in hepatic function. Until a radiologic signature of tumor control is determined, freedom from local progression seems to be the best measure of HCC control after SBRT.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Inc.",Excluded

Patients underwent dosimetry (day -21) with 5 mCi (185 MBq) 111In- ibritumomab tiuxetan following 250 mg/m2 rituximab, followed a week later by 90Y-ibritumomab tiuxetan to deliver a target dose of 1000 cGy to highest normal organ. Bone marrow biopsy was done on day -7 to estimate radiation dose and stem cells were reinfused when the radiation dose was estimated to be less than 5 cGy. The median 90Y-ibritumomab tiuxetan dose was 71.6 mCi (2649.2 MBq; range, 36.6-105 mCi; range, 1354.2-3885 MBq). Histology included follicular lymphoma (n = 12), diffuse large B-cell (n = 14), and mantle cell (n = 5). The median number of prior chemotherapy treatments was 2. The treatment was well tolerated. The median times to reach an absolute neutrophil count greater than 500/muL and platelet count more than 20 000/muL were 10 days and 12 days, respectively. There were 2 deaths and 5 relapses. At a median follow-up of 22 months, the 2-year estimated overall survival and relapse-free survival rates are 92% and 78%, respectively. We conclude that high-dose 90Y-ibritumomab tiuxetan can be combined safely with highdose etoposide and cyclophosphamide without an increase in transplant-related toxicity or delayed engraftment. © 2005 by The American Society of Hematology.",Excluded
768,"Ventriculoperitoneal shunt malfunction: Cumulative effect of cost, radiation, and turnaround time on the patient and the health care system OBJECTIVE. The purpose of this study was to reiterate the predominance of CT in evaluating ventriculoperitoneal shunt malfunction in terms of cost-effectiveness, reduction of radiation exposure, and turnaround time as the measurement parameters. MATERIALS AND METHODS. This retrospective study included patients 18 years and older with a history of ventriculoperitoneal shunt insertion who presented to the emergency department with symptoms of shunt malfunction and underwent shunt series radiography and head CT within 12 hours. Shunt revision occurring contemporaneously with imaging was defined as revision within 48 hours of the original imaging report. The effective radiation dose was calculated by multiplying dose-length product from the scanner with the standard conversion coefficient k (k = 0.0021 mSv/mGy x cm). The turnaround time for patients who underwent both head CT and shunt series radiography was calculated from time of the first study to the time of completion of the last study. RESULTS. There were 16 shunt revisions in 239 patients. The sensitivity of CT was 87.5%; specificity, 91.4%; positive predictive value, 42.4%; and negative predictive value, 99%. The sensitivity of shunt series radiography was 18.7%; specificity, 90.9%; positive predictive value, 13%; and negative predictive value, 93.9%. There were 223 observations of CT radiation dose per patient (mean, 1.87 +/- 0.45). There also were 223 observations of shunt radiography radiation dose per patient (mean, 1.57 +/- 0.60). The median turnaround time among patients undergoing CT and shunt radiography was 109 +/- 84 minutes. CONCLUSION. Shunt series radiography is a low-yield diagnostic imaging modality for identifying shunt malfunction and prolongs turnaround time, increases medical cost, and exposes patients to unnecessary radiation. © American Roentgen Ray Society.",Excluded
132,"Stereotactic radiosurgery for intractable cluster headache: An initial report from the North American Gamma Knife Consortium: Clinical article Object. The aim of this study was to evaluate the outcomes of Gamma Knife surgery (GKS) when used for patients with intractable cluster headache (CH). Methods. Four participating centers of the North American Gamma Knife Consortium identified 17 patients who underwent GKS for intractable CH between 1996 and 2008. The median patient age was 47 years (range 26-83 years). The median duration of pain before GKS was 10 years (range 1.3-40 years). Seven patients underwent unsuccessful prior surgical procedures, including microvascular decompression (2 patients), microvascular decompression with glycerol rhizotomy (2 patients), deep brain stimulation (1 patient), trigeminal ganglion stimulation (1 patient), and prior GKS (1 patient). Fourteen patients had associated autonomic symptoms. The radiosurgical target was the trigeminal nerve (TN) root and the sphenopalatine ganglion (SPG) in 8 patients, only the TN in 8 patients, and only the SPG in 1 patient. The median maximum TN and SPG dose was 80 Gy. Results. Favorable pain relief (Barrow Neurological Institute Grades I-IIIb) was achieved and maintained in 10 (59%) of 17 patients at a median follow-up of 34 months. Three patients required additional procedures (repeat GKS in 2 patients, hypothalamic deep brain stimulation in 1 patient). Eight (50%) of 16 patients who had their TN irradiated developed facial sensory dysfunction after GKS. Conclusions. Gamma Knife surgery for intractable, medically refractory CH provided lasting pain reduction in approximately 60% of patients, but was associated with a significantly greater chance of facial sensory disturbances than GKS used for trigeminal neuralgia.",Excluded

319,"miRNA-95 mediates radioresistance in tumors by targeting the sphingolipid phosphatase SGPP1 Radiation resistance poses a major clinical challenge in cancer treatment, but little is known about how microRNA (miR) may regulate this phenomenon. In this study, we used next-generation sequencing to perform an unbiased comparison of miR expression in PC3 prostate cancer cells rendered resistant to fractionated radiation treatment. One miR candidate found to be upregulated by ionizing radiation was miR-95, the enforced expression of which promoted radiation resistance in a variety of cancer cells. miR-95 overexpression recapitulated an aggressive phenotype including increased cellular proliferation, deregulated G2-M checkpoint following ionizing radiation, and increased invasive potential. Using combined in silico prediction and microarray expression analyses, we identified and validated the sphingolipid phosphatase SGPP1, an antagonist of sphingosine-1-phosphate signaling, as a target of miR-95 that promotes radiation resistance. Consistent with this finding, cell treatment with FTY720, a clinically approved small molecule inhibitor of S1P signaling, sensitized miR-95 overexpressing cells to radiation treatment. In vivo assays extended the significance of these results, showing that miR-95 overexpression increased tumor growth and resistance to radiation treatment in tumor xenografts. Furthermore, reduced tumor necrosis and increased cellular proliferation were seen after radiation treatment of miR-95 overexpressing tumors compared with control tumors. Finally, miR-95 expression was increased in human prostate and breast cancer specimens compared with normal tissue. Together, our work reveals miR-95 expression as a critical determinant of radiation resistance in cancer cells.",Included
3567,"Stereotactic ablative radiotherapy and systemic treatments for extracerebral oligometastases, oligorecurrence, oligopersistence and oligoprogression from lung cancer BACKGROUND: Stereotactic irradiation (SBRT) is a standard of care for inoperable stage I lung cancer and brain oligometastases from lung cancer but is controversial for extracranial oligometastases. We assessed outcomes of lung cancer patients with extracranial metastases in oligometastatic, oligorecurrent, oligopersistent and oligoprogressive settings (""oligometastatic spectrum"") under strategies using SBRT +/- systemic treatments., METHODS: A retrospective multicentric study of consecutive lung cancer adult patients with 1-5 extracranial metastases treated with SBRT was conducted., RESULTS: Of 91 patients (99 metastases, median age 63, 64.8% adenocarcinomas, 19.8% molecular alterations), 11% had oligometastases, 49.5% oligorecurrence, 19.8% oligopersistence and 19.8% oligoprogression. Of 36% of patients under systemic treatments at initiation of SBRT, systemic treatment interruption was performed in 58% of them. With median follow up of 15.3 months, crude local control at irradiated metastases was 91%, while median distant progression-free survival (dPFS) and overall survival were 6.3 and 28.4 months (2-year survival 54%). Initial nodal stage and oligometastatic spectrum were prognostic factors for dPFS; age, initial primary stage and oligometastatic spectrum were prognostic factors for survival on multivariate analysis. Patients with oncogene-addicted tumors more frequently had oligoprogressive disease. Repeat ablative irradiations were preformed in 80% of patients who had oligorelapses. Worst acute toxicities consisted of 5.5% and one late toxic death occurred., CONCLUSION: The oligometastatic spectrum is a strong prognosticator in patients undergoing SBRT for extracranial metastases. Median survival was over two years but dPFS was about 6 months. Continuation of systemic therapy in oligoprogressive patients should be investigated.",Excluded

The difference in pathogenicity between irradiated and non-irradiated populations Babesia bovis parasites attenuated by 35 krads gamma irradiation and parasites not exposed to irradiation, were injected into intact 2-year-old Hereford steers. All five animals receiving non-irradiated blood died but the five animals which received irradiated blood were only mildly affected. Highly significant differences were observed in changes to plasma fibrinogen, serum fibrinogen-like proteins, packed cell volume, partial thromboplastin time, prothrombin time, blood kinins, and plasma kininogen levels in the control animals but non-significant changes in these parameters occurred in the group receiving iradiated blood. Significant changes in the antiplasmin alpha 2M, and the antithrombin levels occurred in control cattle but not in the group receiving irradiated blood. Parasite multiplications rates and maximum parasitaemias were similar in both groups. Irradiation reduced the dose of living parasites from 1 x 10(8) to 2.5 x 10(3), but this was not the reason for the mild reactions. It was concluded that irradiation had selected an avirulent parasite population.",Included
1203,"Initial experience with stereotactic body radiotherapy for intrahepatic hepatocellular carcinoma recurrence after liver transplantation BACKGROUND Graft hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) recurrence after liver transplant is more frequently encountered. Graft hepatectomy is technically challenging and is associated with high morbidity. Stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) has been shown to be safe and effective for the treatment of primary HCC. However, its role in HCC recurrence in a liver graft remains unclear. AIM To evaluate the safety and efficacy of SBRT for the treatment of graft HCC recurrence after liver transplantation. METHODS A retrospective study was conducted. From 2012 to 2018, 6 patients with intrahepatic HCC recurrence after liver transplant were treated with SBRT at Queen Mary Hospital, the University of Hong Kong. The primary outcome was time to overall disease progression and secondary outcomes were time to local progression and best local response, as assessed with the Modified response Evaluation Criteria for Solid Tumours criteria. Patients were monitored for treatment related toxicities and graft dysfunction. RESULTS A total of 9 treatment courses were given for 13 tumours. The median tumour size was 2.3 cm (range 0.7-3.6 cm). Two (22%) patients had inferior vena cava tumour thrombus. The best local treatment response was: 5 (55%) complete response, 1 (11%) partial response and 3 (33%) stable disease. After a median follow up duration of 15.5 mo, no local progression or mortality was yet observed. The median time to overall disease progression was 6.5 mo. There were 6 regional progression in the liver graft (67%) and 2 distant progression in the lung (22%). There was no grade 3 or above toxicity and there was no graft dysfunction after SBRT. CONCLUSION SBRT appears to be safe in this context. Regional progression is the mode of failure.Copyright ©The Author(s) 2020.",Excluded
2271,"Cytogenetic status of interventional radiology unit workers occupationally exposed to low-dose ionising radiation: A pilot study Interventional radiology unit workers represent one of the occupationally most exposed populations to low-dose ionizing radiation. Since there are many uncertainties in research of doses below 100 mSv, this study attempted to evaluate DNA damage levels in chronically exposed personnel. The study group consisted of 24 subjects matched with a control population by the number of participants, age, gender ratio, active smoking status, the period of blood sampling, and residence. Based on regular dosimetry using thermoluminiscent dosimeters, our study group occupationally received a dose of 1.82 +/- 3.60 mSv over the last year.

Few reports demonstrated similar results retrospective with a single k-wire. The aim of the study is to describe our single k-wire technique and evaluate the related results. METHOD(S): This is a retrospective study of a continuous series of patients treated with a single intramedullary k-wire for FFMN. It includes 30 patients who met the criteria for surgery: a dorsal angulation of more than 30degree, malrotation, or both. The mean clinical follow-up period was 7+/-14.9 months. RESULT(S): The mean pre-operative angle was 50degree+/-11.35degree and the mean immediate post-operative angle was 4.86degree+/-2.8degree. The mean immediate correction was 47degree+/-9.3degree. The mean correction at last follow-up was 45.14degree+/-8.55degree. Healing was obtained in all patients and bone union was achieved at a mean of 5.6+/-1.2 weeks. The mean operative time was 8.5 min. The mean C-arm usage (number of clicks) was 7.2 times. The mean exposure radiation time was calculated at 3.6 s. The mean radiation dose was 0.08 mGy/mm2. The mean satisfaction score was 1.26+/-0.45. Quick-DASH and EQ-5D scores yielded excellent values.

480,"Evaluation of cancer tests of 1,3-butadiene using internal dose, genotoxic potency, and a multiplicative risk model In cancer tests with 1,3-butadiene (BD), the mouse is much more sensitive than the rat. This is considered to be related to the metabolism of BD to the epoxide metabolites, 1,2-epoxy-3-butene (EB), 1,2:3,4-diepoxybutane, and 1,2-epoxy-3,4-butanediol. This study evaluates whether the large difference in outcome in cancer tests with BD could be predicted quantitatively on the basis of the concentration over time in blood (AUC) of the epoxide metabolites, their mutagenic potency, and a multiplicative cancer risk model, which has earlier been used for ionizing radiation. Published data on hemoglobin adduct levels from inhalation experiments with BD were used for the estimation of the AUC of the epoxide metabolites in the cancer tests. The estimated AUC of the epoxides were then weighed together to a total genotoxic dose, by using the relative genotoxic potency of the respective epoxide inferred from in vitro hprt mutation assays using EB as standard. The tumor incidences predicted with the risk model on the basis of the total genotoxic dose correlated well with the earlier observed tumor incidences in the cancer tests. The total genotoxic dose that leads to a doubling of the tumor incidences was estimated to be the same in both species, 9 to 10 mmol/Lxh EB-equivalents. The study validates the applicability of the multiplicative cancer risk model to genotoxic chemicals. Furthermore, according to this evaluation, different epoxide metabolites are predominating cancer-initiating agents in the cancer tests with BD, the diepoxide in the mouse, and the monoepoxides in the rat.",Excluded

615,"MRI can play a decisive role in establishing acute and chronic muscle infarction as the primary and often unsuspected cause of sickle cell crisis: A 20-year follow-up of prior and current cases Objective: To demonstrate that MRI rather than radionuclide, CT, ultrasound or PET scans is most efficient and specific in establishing muscle infarction as the primary cause of sickle cell crisis. MRI can therefore serve as a basis for initiating prompt treatment in the emergency department or nontreatment in the setting of suspected addiction. Longstanding chronic changes are also important to recognize. Material(s) and Method(s): Thirty patients with sickle cell disease included 17 patients followed for 20 years (6 male, 11 female; age range, 17-55 years, 15 with sickle cell anemia and 2 sickle beta thalassemia) with MRI-documented muscle infarcts initially imaged within 24-72 hours of limb pain utilizing Phillips 0.5-T superconductive magnets with interim and more recent studies using superconductive 1.5- and 3-T magnets (Sigma, GE Healthcare), dedicated extremity coils, and T1-weighted, fast spin-echo, fat-saturated, and fluid-sensitive sequences. Result(s): All studies showed acute and chronic abnormal MRI soft-tissue patterns. One third of lower limbs (20 of 60 prior patients) had focally increased signal loci compatible with acute or subacute inflammation, edema, or both associated with hemorrhage or ischemia. In cases without SI alteration in bone or soft tissue, sickle cell crisis could not be substantiated. In the 20 limbs with increased SI loci followed for 20 years, changes ranged from diminishing signal alterations to complete, often bilaterally symmetric curvilinear or rectangular signal voids attributed to infarcts or fibrosis. Recent radiographs when interpreted without adequate history or referral to prior MR studies showed large focal ossifications at one of multiple sites in upper and lower limbs compatible with myositis ossificans without known conventional trauma. Conclusion(s): MR imaging can function as an effective problem solver in patients with sickle cell disease with extremity pain without definitive evidence on multiple other imaging modalities in instances of suspected sickle cell crisis. Chronic or long delayed soft-tissue changes of sickle cell crisis are important to recognize along with muscle involvement in an acute crisis. The latter leads to prompt treatment in the emergency department or no treatment in instances of suspected addiction. Chronic soft-tissue changes are also important since they may be mistaken for nonspecific entities, e.g., myositis ossificans in all stages of repair and resolution on the commonly used imaging modalities in modern practice.

However, the potential occupational health effects are still unclear. The purpose of this study was to examine the prevalence of health problems among personnel staff working in interventional cardiology/cardiac electrophysiology and correlate them with the length of occupational radiation exposure., METHODS AND RESULTS: We used a self-administered questionnaire to collect demographic information, work-related information, lifestyle-confounding factors, all current medications, and health status. A total number of 746 questionnaires were properly filled comprising 466 exposed staff (281 males; 44+/-9 years) and 280 unexposed subjects (179 males; 43+/-7years). Exposed personnel included 218 interventional cardiologists and electrophysiologists (168 males; 46+/-9 years); 191 nurses (76 males; 42+/-7 years), and 57 technicians (37 males; 40+/-12 years) working for a median of 10 years (quartiles: 5-24 years).

2373,"Normalized Dual-Energy Iodine Ratio Best Differentiates Renal Cell Carcinoma Subtypes among Quantitative Imaging Biomarkers from Perfusion CT and Dual-Energy CT OBJECTIVE. The objective of our study was to assess and compare the diagnostic accuracy of perfusion CT (PCT) and dual-energy CT (DECT) in differentiating clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) from non-ccRCC. MATERIALS AND METHODS. This retrospective study included 51 patients with 52 renal cell carcinomas (RCCs) (36 ccRCCs and 16 non-ccRCCs) who underwent both PCT and DECT before surgery or biopsy between January 2014 and December 2018. Three independent readers measured blood flow, blood volume (BV), and permeability using PCT and iodine concentration (IC) and iodine ratio using DECT. Interreader agreement was calculated using the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC). Multivariable logistic regression analysis was performed to assess PCT and DECT models. Size-specific dose estimates of the two methods were compared. RESULTS. BV (ICC, 0.93) and iodine ratio (ICC, 0.85) were the most reproducible parameters. Both PCT and DECT were significant models (p < 0.05, all readers) for differentiating ccRCC from non-ccRCC. There was no significant difference in diagnostic accuracy between PCT and DECT (p > 0.05). BV and iodine ratio were independent predictors of non-ccRCC (p < 0.05). However, the mean size-specific dose estimate was 16 times lower with DECT than with PCT (p < 0.001). The AUC of iodine ratio was 0.95, and sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy with an iodine ratio cutoff of 63.72% was 0.90, 0.86, and 0.87, respectively. CONCLUSION. PCT and DECT had comparable and high diagnostic accuracy in differentiating RCC subtypes; however, because of the significantly lower radiation dose of DECT, iodine ratio may be used as the best independent predictor.Copyright © American Roentgen Ray Society",Excluded

WSDP (50 or 150 mg/kg) exerted a significant antimetastatic effect (P < 0.001) when given either before or after tumor cell inoculation. In combined treatment WSDP and Epirubicin profoundly inhibited metastasis formation; this synergistic effect is maximal when Epirubicin and WSDP were administrated after tumor cell inoculation. Positive outcome of combined treatment with WSDP and Epirubicin was also found regarding the number of red and white blood cells in peripheral blood while in mice treated with Epirubicin alone the significant drop in all hematological parameters was noticed on day 13 after tumor cell inoculation. Furthermore, when WSDP (50 mg/kg) was given perorally (po) for 20 consecutive days an increased number of exogenous CFUs was found in treated mice. WSDP given either for 20 or 40 days increased cellularity of hematopoietic tissue and the number of leucocytes in peripheral blood; prolonged treatment with WSDP also elevated myeloid and megakaryocytic types of CFUs. To conclude, these findings indicate that the combination of WSDP with chemotherapeutics could increase the antimetastatic potential of chemotherapeutic agents; these findings suggest the benefits of potential clinical trials using WSDP combined with chemotherapeutic agents in order to maximize their antitumor activity and minimize postchemotherapeutic or radiotherapeutic deteriorated reactions.",Excluded
441,"Nomogram for predicting symptom severity during radiation therapy for head and neck cancer OBJECTIVES: Radiation therapy (RT), with or without chemotherapy, can cause significant acute toxicity among patients treated for head and neck cancer (HNC), but predicting, before treatment, who will experience a particular toxicity or symptom is difficult. We created and evaluated 2 multivariate models and generated a nomogram to predict symptom severity during RT based on a patient-reported outcome (PRO) instrument, the MD Anderson Symptom Inventory-Head and Neck Module (MDASI-HN)., STUDY DESIGN: This was a prospective, longitudinal, questionnaire-based study., SETTING: Tertiary cancer care center., SUBJECTS AND METHODS: Subjects were 264 patients with HNC (mostly oropharyngeal) who had completed the MDASI-HN before and during therapy. Pretreatment variables were correlated with MDASI-HN symptom scores during therapy with multivariate modeling and then were correlated with the composite MDASI-HN score during week 5 of therapy., RESULTS: A multivariate model incorporating pretreatment PROs better predicted MDASI-HN symptom scores during treatment than did a model based on clinical variables and physician-rated patient performance status alone (Akaike information criterion = 1442.5 vs 1459.9). In the most parsimonious model, pretreatment MDASI-HN symptom severity (P < .001), concurrent chemotherapy (P = .006), primary tumor site (P = .016), and receipt of definitive (rather than adjuvant) RT (P = .044) correlated with MDASI-HN symptom scores during week 5. That model was used to construct a nomogram., CONCLUSION: Our model demonstrates the value of incorporating baseline PROs, in addition to disease and treatment characteristics, to predict patient symptom burden during therapy. Although additional investigation and validation are required, PRO-inclusive prediction tools can be useful for improving symptom interventions and expectations for patients being treated for HNC.

172,"Postoperative irradiation for pterygium: retrospective analysis of 1,253 patients from the Osaka University Hospital BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Irradiation of ocular pterygium is considered a valuable treatment supplementation after surgical therapy. Since prospective randomized trials are scare and only limited patient data are available, the aim of this study was to evaluate the patient population treated with fractioned 90Sr irradiation after surgical pterygium resection., PATIENTS AND METHODS: Between September 1993 and March 2001, 1,147 patients with pterygium lesions (1,320 lesions) were treated surgically and with 90Sr postoperative beta-irradiation. A total dose of 30 Gy was used for patients treated within 48 h after surgery, while those treated>48 h postoperatively received a total dose of 35 Gy. A minimum follow-up period of 3 months was required for inclusion in the analysis, and 1,253 lesions were ultimately analyzed., RESULTS: Recurrence of the pterygium after postoperative 90Sr irradiation was observed in 97 of 1,253 cases (7.7%). Statistical analysis (uni- and multivariate) revealed, that male gender, younger age (<40 years), prior treatment (surgery and radiotherapy) and immediate irradiation (<2 h after surgery) were negative predictors for local recurrence. Temporary radiotherapy-induced side effects were observed in 15.2% of patients, including moderate conjunctivitis, local pain, visual disturbance and photophobia or an increase in tear flow. However, no long-term serious side effects were documented., CONCLUSION: 90Sr irradiation of pterygium after surgery represents a safe and effective treatment option to prevent disease recurrence. The data obtained in this study indicate that a certain interval after surgery might improve therapy outcome.",Included
2745,"Neoadjuvant chemoradiation for esophageal cancer: Surgery improves locoregional control while response based on FDG-PET/CT predicts survival Introduction: To retrospectively analyze the outcome of patients with esophageal cancer treated with neoadjuvant chemoradiation. Method(s): A total of 41 patients received neoadjuvant intent chemoradiation for esophageal cancer. Most patients had a locally advanced disease (T3/4: 82%, N+: 83%, M0: 100%) and squamous cell carcinoma (83%). All patients received concurrent chemotherapy with cisplatin/5-fluorouracil or mitomycin/5-fluorouracil. Median radiation dose was 50.4Gy in the 25 patients who proceeded to surgery and 57.4Gy in 16 patients who did not undergo surgery. FDG-PET/CT was used for treatment planning in 24 patients. A second FDG-PET/CT was available for response evaluation in 18 patients. Result(s): Median follow-up was 16 months in all patients and 30 months in survivors. Radiotherapy was completed without interruptions >3 days in 90% of patients, and chemotherapy was carried out to >80% in 85% of patients. The 2-year locoregional control rate was 60%, distant control rate 54% and overall survival rate 50%. Hematological toxicity grade 3/4 was observed in 34%/10% of patients and non-hematological toxicity grade 3/4 in 46%/2% of patients. Perioperative 30-day mortality was 4%. Subgroup analyses revealed that surgery significantly improved locoregional control (74% vs. 39%, p= 0.034), but not the 2-year survival rate (54% vs. 43%, p= 0.246). In contrast, response based on FDG-PET/CT prior and after chemoradiation significantly predicted improved overall survival (2-year overall survival 61% vs. 40%, p= 0.048). Conclusion(s): Outcomes of our cohort were comparable to other series using similar treatments. Surgery significantly improved locoregional control but not survival. Response based on FDG-PET/CT predicted survival and might be used for treatment stratification.Copyright © 2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.",Excluded
3429,"Improved visualization of the urinary tract in multidetector CT urography (MDCTU): analysis of individual acquisition delay and opacification using furosemide and low-dose test images PURPOSE: To retrospectively analyze the reliability of opacification and image quality of a modified MDCTU examination protocol using furosemide and an individual acquisition delay by low-dose test images, MATERIALS AND METHODS: Excretory phase images obtained from 4-row and 16-row MSCTU examinations in 103 patients (69 men, 34 women) were independently reviewed by two radiologists. MDCTUs were performed by using a low-dose furosemide iv injection. No fixed delay for urographic image acquisition was applied. Urographic timing was individually adjusted by performing low-dose test images of the distal ureters to display their current opacification. Image analysis included grading of opacification and image quality of the segmented collecting system. Average urographic delay was calculated. Stratified comparisons of mean scores were assessed. Interobserver kappa values were calculated., RESULTS: Calculated median scan delay for patients with normal creatine levels (n = 92) was 420 sec (mean 453 sec; SD, 121 sec). The median number of acquired test images was 2 (range 1-6 images). The analysis of opacification demonstrated that 97% of the ICS, 89% of the proximal, 86% of the middle, and 81% of the distal ureter segments showed opacification greater than 90%. 7.8% of the distal ureteral segments could not be visualized. Statistics did not show significant differences of opacification between proximal, middle, and distal ureteral segments (P > 0.05). Overall image quality of MSCTU showed to be high when latest test images indicated homogeneous bilateral contrasted ureters (Pearson correlation coefficient r= 0.81). Interobserver kappa values were 0.8 and 0.78., CONCLUSION: Furosemide and scan delay timing by means of test images for MDCTU proved to be a reliable procedure to reach improved opacification of the upper urinary tract. It features the individual adaption of MDCTU to the excretory rate of the kidneys.",Excluded
1803,"Retreatment of vestibular schwannomas with Gamma Knife surgery OBJECT: The response rate of vestibular schwannomas (VSs) to radiosurgery has reached the 97% level in several published series. When failure rarely occurs, some controversy has existed as to whether the tumor has to be resected or can be safely retreated with radiosurgery. The authors retrospectively studied the outcome of retreating 11 patients with Gamma Knife surgery (GKS)., METHODS: The authors studied 11 patients at the New England Gamma Knife Center who had undergone GKS as a second radiosurgical treatment for VS from 1994 to 2007. One patient underwent proton-beam radiotherapy as the first treatment, and the other 10 patients had undergone GKS initially. Tumor control (size before and after the first and the second treatment) was evaluated using MR imaging to demonstrate the course after the 2 treatments. Facial nerve function (House-Brackmann grading system), trigeminal nerve function, hearing (Gardner-Robertson classification), and any adverse radiation effects were evaluated. The prescription dose was 12 Gy (11-13.2 Gy) for both treatments., RESULTS: Of the 11 patients, 2 showed increase, 1 had no change, and, in 8, the VS decreased in size after the retreatment. One tumor remained unchanged over the first 6 months, but demonstrated signs of internal necrosis. All patients demonstrated stable facial nerve function. Regarding facial numbness, 2 patients experienced increases, 8 no change, and 1 decreased numbness. There was no functional hearing prior to the second treatment in 10 patients, and hearing was impaired in 1 patient. Adverse radiation effects (slight peduncular edema) were seen in 2 patients after the second treatment, and 1 patient had edema after the first treatment as well., CONCLUSIONS: Vestibular schwannomas can be retreated with GKS with good tumor control response and low risk of toxicity.",Excluded

Esters, acids and hydroperoxides were found under the surface of the EtO sterilised PEs up to 2 mm depth. The behaviour of gamma ray sterilised PEs is more complex due to the oxidation following the sterilisation process. Ester and acid formation might arise from the diffusion of components of synovial liquid or from the oxidation process, whereas hydroperoxide formation is thought to be due to the oxidation. Abrasion and delamination process is discussed considering the topological distribution of degradation products.",Excluded
1601,"Risk of cataract extraction among adult retinoblastoma survivors Objective: To investigate the risk of cataract extraction among adult retinoblastoma survivors. Design(s): A retrospective cohort study was performed on retinoblastoma survivors who received the diagnosis from 1914 to 1984 and were interviewed in 2000. Lens doses were estimated from radiotherapy records. The cumulative time interval to cataract extraction between dose groups was compared using the log-rank test and Cox regression. Result(s): Seven hundred fifty-three subjects (828 eyes) were available for analysis for an average of 32 years of follow-up. During this period, 51 cataract extractions were reported. One extraction was reported in an eye with no radiotherapy compared with 36 extractions in 306 eyes with 1 course of radiotherapy and 14 among 38 eyes with 2 or 3 treatments. The average time interval to cataract extraction in irradiated eyes was 51 years (95% confidence interval [CI], 48-54) following 1 treatment and 32 years (95% CI, 27-37) after 2 or 3 treatments. Eyes exposed to a therapeutic radiation dose of 5 Gy or more had a 6-fold increased risk (95% CI, 1.3-27.2) of cataract extraction compared with eyes exposed to 2.5 Gy or less. Conclusion(s): The results emphasize the importance of ophthalmologic examination of retinoblastoma survivors who have undergone radiotherapy. The risk of cataract extraction in untreated eyes with retinoblastoma is comparable with the risk of the general population. ©2009 American Medical Association. All rights reserved.",Included
2408,"[Non-Parametric Analysis of Radiation Risks of Mortality among Chernobyl Clean-Up Workers] Analysis of the relationship between dose and mortality from cancer and circulation diseases in the cohort of Chernobyl clean-up workers based on the data from the National Radiation and Epidemiological Registry was performed. Medical and dosimetry information on the clean-up workers, males, who got radiation doses from April 26, 1986 to April 26, 1987, which was accumulated from 1992 to 2012, was used for the analysis. The total size of the cohort was 42929 people, 12731 deaths were registered in the cohort, among them 1893 deaths from solid cancers and 5230 deaths were from circulation diseases. An average age of the workers was 39 years in 1992 and the mean dose was 164 mGy. The dose-effect relationship was estimated with the use of non-parametric analysis of survival with regard to concurrence of risks of mortality. The risks were estimated in 6 dose groups of similar size (1-70, 70-130, 130-190, 190-210, 210-230 and.230-1000 mGy). The group ""1-70 mGy"" was used as control. Estimated dose-effect relationship related to cancers and circulation diseases is described approximately with a linear model, coefficient of determination (the proportion of variability explained by the linear model) for cancers was 23-25% and for circulation diseases - 2-13%. The slope coefficient of the dose-effect relationship normalized to 1 Gy for the ratio of risks for cancers in the linear model was 0.47 (95% CI: -0.77, 1.71), and for circulation diseases it was 0.22 (95% CI: -0.58, 1.02). Risks coefficient (slope coefficient of excess mortality at a dose of 1 Gy) for solid cancers was 1.94 (95% CI: - 3.10, 7.00) x 10(-2) and for circulation diseases it was 0.67 (95% CI: -9.61, 11.00) x 10(-2). 137 deaths from radiation-induced cancers and 47 deaths from circulation diseases were registered during a follow up period.",Included
2100,"Is there need for radioimmunotherapy? results of a phase I/II study in patients with indolent B-cell lymphomas using lutetium-177-DOTA-rituximab AIM: The aim of the study was to explore the clinical response to 177Lutetium-DOTA-rituximab (177Lu-D-R) and to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) in the treatment of patients with relapsed follicular, mantle cell or other indolent lymphomas such as marginal zone lymphoma as well as to put these results into context with other therapy options for these patients., METHODS: Treatment consisted of cold rituximab (250 mg/m2) on day 1 and day 8 and 177Lu-DOTA-Rituximab on day 8. Reassessment was done at week 10. Thirty-one patients (males=17, females=14, median number of pretreatments: 3) were treated in seven cohorts. Escalation of injected activity was carried out in steps of 5 mCi/m2. Dosimetry was performed in the first 20 patients., RESULTS: The MTD was found to be 45 mCi/m2. Thrombocytopenia and leukopenia were the dose-limiting toxicities. Significant anemia only occurred at dose level 7. We observed the nadir of platelets after a median of 36 days from treatment with 177Lu-D-R and a nadir of granulocytes after a median of 50 days from 177Lu-D-R treatment. Non-hematological toxicity was negligible. We observed clinical responses at all dose levels and for all lymphoma entities. Some of the responses were durable; the longest follow up in complete remission is currently over eight years., CONCLUSION: The MTD of 177Lu-DOTA-Rituximab was found to be 45 mCi/m2. Non hematologic toxicity was negligible. Responses were seen in all lymphoma entities and at all dose levels tested. Further testing seems to be most promising mainly in follicular and marginal zone lymphoma in particular as the results compare well to other therapy options for these patients with regard to effectiveness, toxicity and discomfort for the patients.",Excluded

A three-dimensional model of thoracolumbar spine and simulative PVP models (via double transpedicular approach) were built in the Mimics software. With the help of a preoperative transparent marker located at the back midline skin and preoperative digital design by Mimics software, the needle insert point and needle direction in every patient were established. The surgical time, the number of intraoperative radiation perspective, bone cement filling condition in fracture vertebra, intraoperative complications and visual analogue scale (VAS) scores before and after surgery were recorded to evaluate the preliminary clinical results after modified PVP., RESULTS: The puncture process during PVP was in high accordance with the preoperative digital design by Mimics software in seven cases of single OVCF with the average age of 78 years old. The operation time was only 16.57+/-2.07 minutes and the intraoperative radiation perspective numbers were less than ten (7.86+/-1.68) times. The bone cement filling in all fracture vertebras were good and no surgical complications such as spine cord injury and cement leakage were founded. The VAS scores before and after surgery were 8.57+/-0.53 points and 1.43+/-0.53 point (P=0.000), respectively., CONCLUSION: Percutaneous vertebroplasty (PVP) assisted by preoperative CT-based digital design has high accuracy, which is expected to reduce operation time, intraoperative radiation exposure and the surgical complications related to puncture failure.",Excluded
360,"Factors associated with presence and extent of coronary calcium in those predicted to be at low risk according to Framingham risk score (from the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis) Even among asymptomatic persons at low risk (<10%) according to the Framingham risk score, high coronary artery calcium (CAC) scores signify a greater predicted risk of coronary heart disease events. We sought to determine the noninvasive factors (without radiation exposure) significantly associated with CAC in low-risk, asymptomatic persons. In a cross-sectional analysis, we studied 3,046 participants from the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis at a low 10-year predicted risk (Framingham risk score <10%) of coronary heart disease events. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was used to assess the association of novel markers with the presence of any CAC (CAC >0) and advanced CAC (CAC >= 300). A CAC level of >0 and of >= 300 was present in 30% and 3.5% of participants, respectively. Factor VIIIc, fibrinogen, and soluble intercellular adhesion molecule were each associated with the presence of CAC (p <= 0.02), and C-reactive protein, D-dimer, and the carotid intima-media thickness with advanced CAC (p <= 0.03). The base model combining the traditional risk factors had excellent discrimination for advanced CAC (C-statistic 0.808). The addition of the 2 best-fit models combining the biomarkers with or without carotid intima-media thickness improved the c-statistic to 0.822 and 0.820, respectively. All 3 models calibrated well but were similar in estimating the individual risk probabilities for advanced CAC (prevalence 9.97%, 10.63%, and 10.10% in the greatest quartiles of predicted probabilities vs 0.26%, 0.26%, and 0.26% in the lowest quartiles, respectively). In conclusion, in low-risk persons, the traditional risk factors alone predicted advanced CAC with high discrimination and calibration. The biomarker combinations with and without carotid intima-media thickness were also significantly associated with advanced CAC; however, the improvement in the prediction and estimation of the clinical risk were modest compared to the traditional risk factors alone.

1497,"Irradiation induced inversions suppress recombination between the M locus and morphological markers in Aedes aegypti Background: Aedes aegypti is the primary vector of arthropod-borne viruses and one of the most widespread and invasive mosquito species. Due to the lack of efficient specific drugs or vaccination strategies, vector population control methods, such as the sterile insect technique, are receiving renewed interest. However, availability of a reliable genetic sexing strategy is crucial, since there is almost zero tolerance for accidentally released females. Development of genetic sexing strains through classical genetics is hindered by genetic recombination that is not suppressed in males as is the case in many Diptera. Isolation of naturally-occurring or irradiation-induced inversions can enhance the genetic stability of genetic sexing strains developed through genetically linking desirable phenotypes with the male determining region. Result(s): For the induction and isolation of inversions through irradiation, 200 male pupae of the 'BRA' wild type strain were irradiated at 30 Gy and 100 isomale lines were set up by crossing with homozygous 'red-eye' (re) mutant females. Recombination between re and the M locus and the white (w) gene (causing a recessive white eye phenotype when mutated) and the M locus was tested in 45 and 32 lines, respectively. One inversion (Inv35) reduced recombination between both re and the M locus, and wand the M locus, consistent with the presence of a rather extended inversion between the two morphological mutations, that includes the M locus. Another inversion (Inv5) reduced recombination only between w and the M locus. In search of naturally-occurring, recombination-suppressing inversions, homozygous females from the red eye and the white eye strains were crossed with seventeen and fourteen wild type strains collected worldwide, representing either recently colonized or long-established laboratory populations. Despite evidence of varying frequencies of recombination, no combination led to the elimination or substantial reduction of recombination. Conclusion(s): Inducing inversions through irradiation is a feasible strategy to isolate recombination suppressors either on the M or the m chromosome for Aedes aegypti. Such inversions can be incorporated in genetic sexing strains developed through classical genetics to enhance their genetic stability and support SIT or other approaches that aim to population suppression through male-delivered sterility.Copyright © 2020, The Author(s).",Excluded

1693,"Faecal microbiota transplantation protects against radiation-induced toxicity Severe radiation exposure may cause acute radiation syndrome, a possibly fatal condition requiring effective therapy. Gut microbiota can be manipulated to fight against many diseases. We explored whether intestinal microbe transplantation could alleviate radiation-induced toxicity. High-throughput sequencing showed that gastrointestinal bacterial community composition differed between male and female mice and was associated with susceptibility to radiation toxicity. Faecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) increased the survival rate of irradiated animals, elevated peripheral white blood cell counts and improved gastrointestinal tract function and intestinal epithelial integrity in irradiated male and female mice. FMT preserved the intestinal bacterial composition and retained mRNA and long non-coding RNA expression profiles of host small intestines in a sex-specific fashion. Despite promoting angiogenesis, sex-matched FMT did not accelerate the proliferation of cancer cells in vivo. FMT might serve as a therapeutic to mitigate radiation-induced toxicity and improve the prognosis of tumour patients after radiotherapy.Copyright © 2017 The Authors.

2784,"Parotid gland-recovery after radiotherapy in the head and neck region - 36 months follow-up of a prospective clinical study Background: The aim of the present study was to evaluate the recovery potential of the parotid glands after using either 3D-conformal-radiotherapy (3D-CRT) or intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) by sparing one single parotid gland. Method(s): Between 06/2002 and 10/2008, 117 patients with head and neck cancer were included in this prospective, non-randomised clinical study. All patients were treated with curative intent. Salivary gland function was assessed by measuring stimulated salivary flow at the beginning, during and at the end of radiotherapy as well as 1, 6, 12, 24, and 36 months after treatment. Measurements were converted to flow rates and normalized relative to rates before treatment. Mean doses (Dmean) were calculated from dose-volume histograms based on computed tomographies of the parotid glands. Result(s): Patients were grouped according to the Dmean of the spared parotid gland having the lowest radiation exposure: Group I - Dmean < 26 Gy (n = 36), group II - Dmean 26-40 Gy (n = 45), and group III - Dmean > 40 Gy (n = 36). 15/117 (13%) patients received IMRT. By using IMRT as compared to 3D-CRT the Dmean of the spared parotid gland could be significantly reduced (Dmean IMRT vs. 3D-CRT: 21.7 vs. 34.4 Gy, p < 0.001). The relative salivary flow rates (RFSR) as a function of the mean parotid dose after 24 and 36 months was in group I 66% and 74%, in group II 56% and 49%, and in group III 31% and 24%, respectively. Multiple linear regression analyses revealed that the parotid gland dose and the tumor site were the independent determinants 12 and 36 months after the end of RT. Patients of group I and II parotid gland function did recover at 12, 24, and 36 months after the end of RT. Conclusion(s): If a Dmean < 26 Gy for at least one parotid gland can be achieved then this is sufficient to reach complete recovery of pre-RT salivary flow rates. The radiation volume which depends on tumor site did significantly impact on the Dmean of the parotids, and thus on the saliva flow and recovery of parotid gland.Copyright © 2011 Hey et al.",Excluded
3363,"Perioperative hyperfractionated high-dose rate brachytherapy for the treatment of soft tissue sarcomas: multicentric experience BACKGROUND: Low-dose rate brachytherapy is a well-established adjuvant treatment for soft tissue sarcomas (STS). The experience with high-dose rate brachytherapy (HDR BT) in this indication is limited. The purpose of our study was to evaluate the viability of perioperative hyperfractionated HDR BT for STS., METHODS: Forty-five patients with primary (17 cases) or recurrent (28 cases) STS were treated with resection and HDR BT between 1998 and 2007. Eleven patients were treated with HDR BT alone (mean dose 40 Gy; 30-54 Gy) and 34 were treated with a combination of HDR BT (mean dose 24 Gy; 15-30 Gy) and external beam radiotherapy (EBRT) (40-50 Gy). Hyperfractionation, 3 Gy twice daily, was used for HDR BT with plastic tubes. Adjuvant chemotherapy was indicated for patients with high risk of dissemination., RESULTS: Local control (LC) was achieved in 17 patients (100%) treated for primary tumor and in 18 of 28 patients (64%) treated for recurrence; this difference was statistically significant (p = 0.004). Distant metastases occurred in seven patients (15.6%). The 5-year overall survival was 70%; the 5-year local control was 74%. LC was significantly better for extremities sarcomas in comparison with trunk tumors, for patients treated with EBRT and BT in comparison with BT alone, and for doses >65 Gy., CONCLUSIONS: Our study suggests that perioperative HDR BT is a promising method for achieving high biological doses with good LC in the postoperative radiotherapy of STS and that combination of BT and EBRT provides better tumor control than BT alone.",Excluded

We also wanted to determine whether technetium-99m ((99m)Tc) methylene diphosphonate (MDP) concentrations predict radiation doses of (186)Re etidronate in painful lesions., MATERIALS AND METHODS: Forty-eight patients with breast and prostate cancer were evaluated. Patients received therapeutic doses of (186)Re etidronate. The area under the pain over time curve (AUPC) was measured for 8 weeks after treatment. Response was calculated as the percentage of change in AUPC. Quantitative bone SPECT (QBS)-measured concentration of (186)Re etidronate was used for calculating radiation doses. Receiver operating characteristics curve analysis determined the radiation dose threshold that best separated responders from nonresponders. SPECT-measured concentration of (186)Re etidronate in the urinary bladder was correlated with its concentration in the voided urine. Concentration of (99m)Tc MDP was compared with radiation doses to painful metastases., RESULTS: The radiation dose threshold was 2.10 Gy. For a decrease of 50% in the AUPC, the positive predictive value (PPV) of this value was 75% and the negative predictive value (NPV) was 88%. For a decrease in pain of 33%, the PPV was 84% and the NPV was 81%. In prostate cancer patients only, the PPV was 81% and the NPV was 92%. The correlation between in vivo/in vitro measured urine concentration was 0.90. The correlation between (99m)Tc MDP concentration and radiation doses of (186)Re etidronate was 0.92., CONCLUSION: QBS-measured radiation doses of (186)Re etidronate in painful metastases are a good predictor of pain relief.

909,"Evaluation of focal thyroid lesions incidentally detected in F- 18 fluorodeoxyglucose PET/CT images AIM: Increased uptake in the thyroid gland (TG) is often identified as an incidental finding on whole-body F-18 Fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography/computed tomography (FDG-PET/CT) in the non-thyroid cancer (NTC) patients. Currently, there is no consensus on the appropriate approach for management of these cases. Thyroid ultrasound, scintigraphy and fine-needle aspiration biopsy (FNAB) are suggested to exclude malignant thyroid lesions. Our aim is to determine the importance of increased F-18 FDG uptake in TG on PET/CT in patients who are being screened for various NTC and to recommend a diagnostic strategy to identify patients with high risk of thyroid malignancy. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We evaluated 1086 cases undergoing whole-body PET/CT scan between April 2011 and April 2012. Images with incidental focal FDG uptake in TG were identified. Data of the age, sex, type of primary cancer, maximum standard uptake value (SUVmax), size of thyroid nodules and cervical lymph nodes (CLN) on F-18 FDG-PET/CT images, and if avalaible, FNAB results were evaluated. RESULT(S): 28 of 1086 patients (2.5%) showed a focal increased F-18 FDG uptake of lesions in TG (14 men, 14 women, mean age+/-SD, 60.29+/-13 years) and the SUVmax value ranged from 1.50 to 18.00 (average SUVmax: 4.19+/-3.41). Thyroid lesions ranged in diameter from 7.0 to 55.0 milimeter (mean+/-SD:16.47+/-11.80mm). The CLN were detected in 11/28 patients (39%). The average SUVmax in CLN was 4.04+/-1.80, the mean CLN diameter was 10.13+/-2.95mm. Twelve of 28 patients (43%) were done FNAB, and the final histopathological diagnosis was malign thyroid nodules in five patient (avarage SUVmax 6.84+/-6.37 and nodule diameter 31.26+/-22.11mm), benign thyroid disease in five patient (avarage SUVmax 3.95+/-1.48 and nodule diameter 9.60+/-2.30mm) and limited and unsufficient materials in two patients. Sixteen patients did not undergo any diagnostic test. CONCLUSION(S): Focal increased FDG uptake in TG incidentally identified on FDG-PET/CT occurred at a frequency of 2.5% and this finding may be associated with an increased risk of malignancy, but the clinical significance is unclear. More data are needed to elucidate the role of SUV in the differentiation of benign and malign thyroid lesions. Clinicians should take into consideration incidentally detected PET/CT findings. Thyroid scintigraphy and, if cold nodule is present, FNAB should be suggested to clinicians for definitive diagnosis.",Excluded
3306,"Targeted disruption of NBS1 reveals its roles in mouse development and DNA repair Nijmegen breakage syndrome (NBS) is an autosomal recessive hereditary disease that shares some common defects with ataxia-telangiectasia. The gene product mutated in NBS, named NBS1, is a component of the Mre11 complex that is involved in DNA strand-break repair. To elucidate the physiological roles of NBS1, we disrupted the N-terminal exons of the NBS1 gene in mice. NBS1(m/m) mice are viable, growth retarded and hypersensitive to ionizing radiation (IR). NBS1(m/m) mice exhibit multiple lymphoid developmental defects, and rapidly develop thymic lymphoma. In addition, female NBS1(m/m) mice are sterile due to oogenesis failure. NBS1(m/m) cells are impaired in cellular responses to IR and defective in cellular proliferation. Most systematic and cellular defects identified in NBS1(m/m) mice recapitulate those in NBS patients, and are essentially identical to those observed in Atm(-/-) mice. In contrast to Atm(-/-) mice, spermatogenesis is normal in NBS1(m/m) mice, indicating that distinct roles of ATM have differential requirement for NBS1 activity. Thus, NBS1 and ATM have overlapping and distinct functions in animal development and DNA repair.",Excluded

In this clinical trial, 150 consecutive patients were randomized into three groups: (a) Dose escalation, 1500 SW at 18 kV, followed by 1500 SW at 20 kV then 1500 SW at 22 kV. (b) Constant dose, 4500 SW at 20 kV. All patients undergo plain X-ray film of the urinary tract at day 1, 14, and 90 to assess stone-free rate (SFR) which was defined as no stones or painless fragments less than 4 mm. (c) Dose reduction, 1500 SW at 22 kV, followed by 1500 SW at 20 kV and then 1500 SW at 18 kV. The three treatment groups were comparable in terms of age, sex, stone size and distribution of the kidneys, and the need for Double J stent use. On day 90, the SFR achieved was 82, 90, and 84 % in the escalating, constant, and reduction energy groups, respectively. However, this rate was not statistically significant (x 2 = 1.38, p level = 0.28). At a slow rate of 60 shocks, there was no difference in stone-free rate between different voltages at 1, 14, and 90 days. Our randomized clinical trial showed no statistically significant difference in SFR between the three groups while using the slow SWL rate. Our trial is the first randomized trial comparing the three strategies. As such, a dose adjustment strategy while delivering SWL in slow rate was not recommended.",Excluded
234,"Comparison of 51chromium-labeled ethylenediamine tetra-acetic acid and iohexol as blood markers for intestinal permeability testing in Beagle dogs (51)Chromium-labeled ethylenediamine tetra-acetic acid ((51)Cr-EDTA) is the gold standard probe for assessing intestinal permeability (IP) in dogs, but exposure to radioactivity is a disadvantage. Iohexol is a safe contrast medium commonly used for medical imaging purposes and has been successfully applied more recently for the assessment of IP in animal models and humans. This study aimed at comparing (51)Cr-EDTA and iohexol as IP blood markers in dogs. A test solution containing (51)Cr-EDTA and iohexol was administered intragastrically to seven healthy laboratory Beagle dogs, and percentage recoveries in serum were calculated. The strong linear association (correlation, r=0.76 and linear regression, y=0.03+5.04x) between (51)Cr-EDTA and iohexol supports the potential usefulness of iohexol as an IP blood marker in dogs.

1816,"Influence of dose rate on survival time for 239PuO2-induced radiation pneumonitis or pulmonary fibrosis in dogs Beagle dogs were exposed once or repeatedly to 0.75-microns-diameter monodisperse aerosols of 239PuO2 by pernasal inhalation. The dogs that were exposed once received alveolar depositions (+/- standard deviation) of 3.9 +/- 1.9 kBq/kg body mass and accumulated doses of 23 +/- 8 Gy to the lung before death at 5.4 +/- 1.7 years after exposure. Dogs exposed repeatedly received a total alveolar deposition of 5.3 +/- 0.9 kBq/kg body mass during 7 to 10 semiannual exposures and accumulated doses of 22 +/- 5 Gy to the lung before death at 4.9 +/- 0.7 years after first exposure. Clearance of the plutonium from the lung in the dogs exposed repeatedly was slower than in the dogs exposed once. All dogs in the repeated-exposure study and all but one dog in the single-exposure study died from radiation effects. Pulmonary fibrosis accounted for 72% of the radiation-related deaths in the single-exposure study and 87% in the repeated-exposure study. The remaining dogs died with pulmonary cancer. Based on total cumulative radiation dose, the times after exposure to death from radiation pneumonitis and pulmonary fibrosis were not significantly different for single and repeated exposures. Thus dose rate does not appear to be an important factor in predicting death from radiation pneumonitis or pulmonary fibrosis for dogs inhaling 239PuO2.",Included

570,"Accuracy of low dose CT coronary angiography with prospective ECG-triggering Purpose: To evaluate the accuracy of low dose CT coronary angiography (CTCA) using prospective ECG-triggering for the assessment of coronary artery disease (CAD). Method(s): Thirty patients (19 male, 11 female, mean age 58.8+/-9.9 years) underwent low dose CTCA and invasive coronary angiography (CA) (median 2 days (0, 41)). Before CT scanning, intravenous beta-blocker was administered in 18/30 patients as heart rate (HR) was >65 beats per minute (bpm), achieving a mean HR of 55.7+/-7.9 bpm. CAD was defined as coronary artery narrowing >=50%, using CA as standard of reference. On an intention-to-diagnose-base all non-evaluative segments were included in the analysis. Vessels with a non-evaluative segment and no further finding were censored as false positive. Result(s): The estimated mean effective radiation dose was 2.1+/-0.7 mSv (range: 1.0 - 3.3), yielding 96.0% (383/399) of evaluable segments. Patient based analysis revealed sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV) and negative predictive value (NPV) of 100%, 83.3%, 90.0%, and 100%.

96,"Analysis of DNA repair gene polymorphisms in glioblastoma BACKGROUND: Glioblastoma is the most common and aggressive primary brain tumor in adults. Despite several factors such as ionizing radiation exposure or rare genetic syndromes have been associated with the development of glioblastoma, no underlying cause has been identified for the majority of cases. We thus aimed to investigate the role of DNA repair polymorphisms in modulating glioblastoma risk., METHODS: Genotypic and allelic frequencies of seven common polymorphisms in DNA repair genes involved in nucleotide excision repair (ERCC1 rs11615, ERCC2 rs13181, ERCC6 rs4253079), base excision repair (APEX1 rs1130409, XRCC1 rs25487), double-strand break repair (XRCC3 rs861539) and mismatch repair (MLH1 rs1800734) pathways were analyzed in 115 glioblastoma patients and 200 healthy controls. Haplotype analysis was also performed for ERCC1 rs11615 and ERCC2 rs13181 polymorphisms, located on the same chromosomal region (19q13.32)., RESULTS: Our results indicated that carriers of the ERCC2 Gln/Gln genotype were associated with a lower glioblastoma risk (OR=0.32, 95% CI 0.12-0.89; P=0.028), whereas carriers of the MLH1 AA genotype were associated with an increased risk of glioblastoma (OR=3.14, 95% CI 1.09-9.06; P=0.034). Furthermore, the haplotype containing the C allele of ERCC2 rs13181 polymorphism and the T allele of ERCC1 rs11615 polymorphism was significantly associated with a protective effect of developing glioblastoma (OR=0.34, 95% CI 0.16-0.71; P=0.004)., CONCLUSIONS: These results pointed out that MLH1 rs1800734 and ERCC2 rs13181 polymorphisms might constitute glioblastoma susceptibility factors, and also suggested that the chromosomal region 19q could be important in glioblastoma pathogenesis.

450,"V30 as a predictor for radiation-induced hypothyroidism: A dosimetric analysis in patients who received radiotherapy to the neck Introduction: The purpose of this study is to evaluate the possible predictors of thyroid disorders after neck radiotherapy, with a focus on radiation dose-volume factors. Method(s): Thyroid function was measured in 100 patients who had received radiotherapy to the neck, including the thyroid. All radiation-induced thyroid dysfunctions were determined with an endpoint of abnormal thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH), free triiodothyronine (fT3) and thyroxine (fT4) and thyroid peroxidase antibodies and (TPA). The total volume of the thyroid, mean radiation dose to the thyroid (Dmean) and thyroid volume percentage that received radiation doses of 10-50 Gy (V10-V50) were calculated in all patients. The evaluated risk factors for thyroid dysfunction included dose-volume parameters, sex, age, previous surgery, chemotherapy and comorbidity. Result(s): There were 52 patients with hypothyroidism and V30 (p = 0.03), thyroid volume (p = 0.01) and Dmean (p = 0.03) appeared to be correlated with hypothyroidism in univariate analysis. However, there was not association found in multivariate analysis for these factors. Conclusion(s): Thyroid disorders after radiation therapy to the neck still represent a clinically underestimated problem. V30 may be a useful tool for evaluating the risk of hypothyroidism when determining an individual patient's treatment. © 2014 Akgun et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",Excluded
2752,"Differential recovery of neural stem cells in the subventricular zone and dentate gyrus after ionizing radiation Radiation therapy is a widely used treatment for malignant central nervous system tumors. Mature neurons are terminally differentiated, whereas stem and progenitor cells have a prominent proliferative capacity and are therefore highly vulnerable to irradiation. Our aim was to investigate how cranial radiation in young rats would affect stem/progenitor cells in the two niches of adult neurogenesis, the subventricular zone (SVZ) and the dentate gyrus of the hippocampal formation. Nine weeks after irradiation we found that in irradiated animals, hippocampal neurogenesis was reduced to 5% of control levels. Similarly, the numbers of actively proliferating cells and radial glia-like stem cells (nestin+/glial fibrillary acidic protein [GFAP]+) in the dentate gyrus were reduced to 10% and 15% of control levels, respectively. In the irradiated olfactory bulb, neurogenesis was reduced to 40% of control levels, and the number of actively proliferating cells in the SVZ was reduced to 53% of control levels. However, the number of nestin+/GFAP+ cells in the SVZ was unchanged compared with controls. To evaluate the immediate response to the radiation injury, we quantified the amount of proliferation in the SVZ and dentate gyrus 1 day after irradiation. We found an equal reduction in proliferating cells both in dentate gyrus and SVZ. In summary, we show an initial response to radiation injury that is similar in both brain stem cell niches. However, the long-term effects on stem cells and neurogenesis in these two areas differ significantly: the dentate gyrus is severely affected long-term, whereas the SVZ appears to recover with time.",Included

This study aimed to analyze differences in necrotic changes between cortical and cancellous bone in resection margins after segmental mandibulectomy for advanced mandibular osteoradionecrosis. Methods. Anteroposterior bone specimens from eleven patients who underwent segmental mandibulectomy with simultaneous free fibula flap reconstruction for advanced osteoradionecrosis were analyzed histopathologically for the presence of necrotic bone based on the presence of blood vessels within Haversian canals. Results. Ten of eleven (91%) cortices near the inferior border of the mandible at the anterior margins were necrotic. All cancellous bones at the anterior margins were viable. Seven of eleven (64%) cortices near the inferior border of the mandible at the posterior margins were necrotic. Three of eleven (27%) cancellous bones at the posterior margins were necrotic. Conclusion. Necrotic changes are more prevalent in cortices than in cancellous bones in mandibular osteoradionecrosis, probably due to a decrease of periosteal blood supply caused by radiotherapy.Copyright © 2017 Masaya Akashi et al.",Excluded
2592,"Therapy-related myelodysplasia and secondary acute myelogenous leukemia after high-dose therapy with autologous hematopoietic progenitor-cell support for lymphoid malignancies Purpose: To evaluate the incidence of and risk factors for therapy- related myelodysplasia (tMDS) and secondary acute myelogenous leukemia (sAML), after high-dose therapy (HDT) with autologous bone marrow or peripheral-blood progenitor-cell support, in patients with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL). Patients and Methods: Between January 1985 and November 1996, 230 patients underwent HDT comprising cyclophosphamide therapy and total-body irradiation, with autologous hematopoietic progenitor-cell support, as consolidation of remission. With a median follow-up of 6 years, 27 (12%) developed tMDS or sAML. Result(s): Median time to development of tMDS or sAML was 4.4 years (range, 11 months to 8.8 years) after HDT. Karyotyping (performed in 24 cases) at diagnosis of tMDS or sAML revealed complex karyotypes in 18 patients. Seventeen patients had monosomy 5/5q-, 15 had - 7/7q-, seven had -18/18q-, seven had -13/13q-, and four had -20/20q-. Twenty- one patients died from complications of tMDS or sAML or treatment for tMDS or sAML, at a median of 10 months (range, 0 to 26 months). Sixteen died without evidence of recurrent lymphoma. Six patients were alive at a median follow-up of 6 months (range, 2 to 22 months) after diagnosis of tMDS or sAML. On multivariate analysis, prior fludarabine therapy (P = .009) and older age (P = .02) were associated with the development of tMDS or sAML. Increased interval from diagnosis to HDT and bone marrow involvement at diagnosis were of borderline significance (P = .05 and .07, respectively). Conclusion(s): tMDS and sAML are serious complications of HDT for NHL and are associated with very poor prognosis. Alternative strategies for reducing their incidence and for treatment are needed.

1362,"Postoperative Radiographic Evaluation Following Adult Spine Deformity Correction: The Impact on Subsequent Management and Associated Risk of Radiation Exposure Background: During the follow-up visits after Adult Spine Deformity (ASD) surgery, obtaining surveillance radiographs is a usual practice, and this study tried to identify evidence to support or refute such practice. Method(s): This is a retrospective, diagnostic case series (Level IV) of 49 patients. We identified the abnormal radiographic findings and their association with need for revision surgery. We determined the odds of obtaining an abnormal radiographs that lead to revision surgery at each of the given time intervals of follow-up. We also estimated the risk versus benefit of obtaining radiographs at each of the given time intervals of follow-up. Result(s): We identified a total of 11 individual types of abnormal postoperative radiographic findings. Of them, the two radiographic findings that always needed revision surgery because of the associated clinical presentation were pedicle screw pullout and bilateral rod fracture. One abnormal radiographic finding that was never associated with revision surgery was the halo around a pedicle screw. In each of the given postoperative time intervals of follow-up at which the routine radiographs were obtained, we noted that the odds of noticing abnormal radiographic finding that lead to revision surgery was always >1. We found that the cumulative hazard rate for exposure to radiation was significantly higher during the initial follow-up visits when compared to subsequent follow-up visits. Conclusion(s): This study finds evidence to support the practice of routine postoperative radiographic evaluation of patients who come for follow-up after ASD surgery.Copyright © 2018 Scoliosis Research Society",Excluded
3639,"Estimating the incidence of leukemia attributable to occupational exposure in Iran Objective: The aim this study was to estimate the fraction of leukemia incidence in Iran attributable to occupational exposure to benzene, ionizing radiation, and ethylene oxide. Method(s): Nationwide exposure to each of these leukemogens was estimated using workforce data available at the ILO (International Labor Organization) website. The prevalence of exposure to leukemogens in each industry was estimated using exposure data from the CAREX (CARcinogen EXposure) database. The magnitude of the relative risk of leukemia for each leukemogen was from published literature. Using the Levin's population attributable risk (incidence), fractions of leukemia incidences attributed to workplace leukemogens were then estimated. Result(s): The total workforce in Iran according to the 1995 census included 12,488,020 men and 677,469 women. Agriculture was the largest sector with 24.5% of the males and 0.27% of the females, and the electricals-related sector was the smallest with 1.16% of the males and 0.66% of the females. After applying the CAREX exposure estimates to each sector, the proportion exposed to leukemogens was 0.016% for male workers and 0.02% for female workers. Estimating a relative risk of 3.6 (95% CI of 3.2-4.2) for high exposure and 1.9 (95% CI 1.7-2.1) for low exposure and employing the Levin's formula, the fraction of leukemia attributed to leukemogens in the workplaces among females was 3.6% (95% CI of 3.1-4.5) and among males was 7.6% (95% CI of 6.4-9.2). These fractions corresponded to estimated incidences of 0.60 (95% CI of 0.50-0.70) and 0.22 (95% CI of 0.16-0.23) cases of leukemia per 100,000 populations for males and females, respectively.

704,"First analysis of cancer incidence and occupational radiation exposure based on the National Dose Registry of Canada A cohort study was conducted to investigate the relation between cancer incidence and occupational exposure to ionizing radiation. Records containing dose information from 1951 to 1988 for 191,333 persons were extracted from the National Dose Registry of Canada. The records were linked to the Canadian Cancer Data Base, with incidence data from 1969 to 1988. Standardized incidence ratios were calculated using Canadian cancer incidence rates stratified by age, sex, and calendar year. Excess relative risks were obtained from internally based dose-response analyses. The following significant results were found for males and females combined: a deficit in the standardized incidence ratio for all cancers combined; elevated standardized incidence ratios for thyroid cancer and melanoma; and elevated excess relative risks for rectum, leukemia, lung, all cancers combined, all except lung, and all except leukemia. For males, cancers of the colon, pancreas, and testis also showed significantly elevated excess relative risks. The specific cancer types listed above have been implicated in previous studies on occupational exposure to ionizing radiation, except for testis, colon, and melanoma, while the findings on thyroid cancer from previous studies are inconclusive. The thyroid standardized incidence ratios in this study are highly significant, but further investigation is needed to assess the possibility of association with occupational radiation exposure.",Included
357,"Dynamic change of optical quality in patients with dry eye disease PURPOSE: To evaluate the dynamic changes of optical quality in patients with dry eye disease (DED) by using a double-pass system., METHODS: Fifty-six patients with DED and 35 control subjects were included in this study. Each patient underwent an evaluation of the ocular surface, using the Ocular Surface Disease Index, tear film breakup time (TBUT), corneal and conjunctival staining (Oxford scale), and Schirmer I test. Using the tear film analysis program of the Optical Quality Analysis System, we recorded the objective scatter index (OSI) every 0.5 seconds within a 20-second period with the subjects asked to blink freely. Several parameters were established to evaluate the dynamic alterations of optical quality and the effects of blinks: OSI standard deviation (SD), DELTAOSI, DELTAOSI/time, blinking change (BC), blinking frequency (BF), and tolerant limitation (TL)., RESULTS: Patients with DED had significant alterations of optical quality compared to control subjects. The DELTAOSI, DELTAOSI/time, BC, and BF were significantly higher and TL was significantly lower in DED patients than controls. Furthermore, the DELTAOSI and DELTAOSI/time were also significantly higher in patients with severe DED than patients with mild disease. In univariate analysis, both TBUT and corneal staining were correlated with DELTAOSI, DELTAOSI/time, and BC. In multivariate analysis, DELTAOSI/time was correlated to the corneal staining score., CONCLUSIONS: The double-pass system allowed the monitoring of the dynamic changes of optical quality in patients with DED. Optical quality should be evaluated in patients with DED because these alterations cannot be determined from the classical DED clinical tests.",Excluded
3579,"Stereotactic radiosurgery for medically refractory multiple sclerosis-related tremor OBJECTIVE Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a neurodegenerative disease that can lead to severe intention tremor in some patients. In several case reports, conventional radiotherapy has been reported to possibly exacerbate MS. Radiosurgery dramatically limits normal tissue irradiation to potentially avoid such a problem. Gamma Knife thalamotomy (GKT) has been established as a minimally invasive technique that is effective in treating essential tremor and Parkinson's disease- related tremor. The goal in this study was to analyze the outcomes of GKT in patients suffering from medically refractory MS-related tremor. METHODS The authors retrospectively studied the outcomes of 15 patients (mean age 46.5 years) who had undergone GKT over a 15-year period (1998-2012). Fourteen patients underwent GKT at a median maximum dose of 140 Gy (range 130-150 Gy) using a single 4-mm isocenter. One patient underwent GKT at a dose of 140 Gy delivered via two 4-mm isocenters (3 mm apart). The posteroinferior region of the nucleus ventralis intermedius (VIM) was the target for all GKTs. The Fahn-Tolosa-Marin clinical tremor rating scale was used to evaluate tremor, handwriting, drawing, and drinking. The median time to the last follow-up was 39 months. RESULTS After GKT, 13 patients experienced tremor improvement on the side contralateral to surgery. Four patients noted tremor arrest at a median of 4.5 months post-GKT. Seven patients had excellent tremor improvement and 6 had good tremor improvement. Four patients noted excellent functional improvement, 8 noted good functional improvement, and 1 noted satisfactory functional improvement. Three patients experienced diminished tremor relief at a median of 18 months after radiosurgery. Two patients experienced temporary adverse radiation effects. Another patient developed a large thalamic cyst 60 months after GKT, which was successfully managed with Ommaya reservoir placement. CONCLUSIONS Gamma Knife thalamotomy was found to be a minimally invasive and beneficial procedure for medically refractory MS tremor.Copyright © AANS 2018.",Excluded

METHOD(S): Twelve histologically confirmed patients with metastatic MTC were included. All patients underwent both 111In-DTPA-octreotide imaging and 131I/ 123I-meta-iodobenzylguanidine (MIBG) imaging. According to the results of the combined imaging, positive patients were selected to be treated with 90Y-DOTA-D-Phe1-Tyr3-octreotide (90Y-DOTATOC) or 131I-MIBG, respectively. The therapeutic procedures of targeted internal radiation were performed with 3.33 GBq 90Y-DOTATOC at 6-week intervals, or 11.1 GBq 131I-MIBG with a minimum interval of three months. RESULT(S): The imaging procedure was positive in all 12 patients: 111In-DTPA-octreotide imaging in eight patients, 131I/ 123I-MIBG imaging in six patients. According to the results of combined imaging, we identified four patients to be treated with 90Y-DOTATOC, and five patients with 131 I-MIBG. After three to five sessions of treatment, three patients with partial remission and six with stable disease were observed. The effective rate was 3/9 (33.3%) and the overall tumor response rate was 9/9 (100%). No relevant toxicity was observed. CONCLUSION(S): The combined imaging technique can be used to identify patients for effective radionuclide treatment. The treatment with 90Y-DOTATOC or 131I-MIBG is well tolerated and may improve the fate of patients with metastatic MTC.",Excluded

Moreover, contrast use and radiation exposure were not different between groups. DES use, however, was associated with a significantly lower late lumen (LL) loss in the main and the side branch as compared to the Frontier stent and BMS group. Likewise, MACE rates were lowest in the DES group (6%, P < 0.05 vs. BMS) as compared to the Frontier stent (9%) and the BMS group (16%). The Frontier stent accomplishes treatment of CBL with excellent acute clinical, procedural, and angiographic results. Provisional T-stenting using DES provides superior clinical and angiographic long-term results as compared to BMS and Frontier stents. The results of next generation CBL systems combining a dedicated specific CBL design with DES surfaces are to be awaited.",Excluded
1077,"Consequences of the radiation accident at the Mayak production association in 1957 (the 'Kyshtym Accident') This paper presents an overview of the nuclear accident that occurred at the Mayak Production Association (PA) in the Russian Federation on 29 September 1957, often referred to as 'Kyshtym Accident', when 20 MCi (740 PBq) of radionuclides were released by a chemical explosion in a radioactive waste storage tank. 2 MCi (74 PBq) spread beyond the Mayak PA site to form the East Urals Radioactive Trace (EURT). The paper describes the accident and gives brief characteristics of the efficacy of the implemented protective measures that made it possible to considerably reduce doses to the exposed population. The paper also provides retrospective dosimetry estimates for the members of the EURT Cohort (EURTC) which comprises approximately 21 400 people. During the first two years after the accident a decrease in the group average leukocyte (mainly due to neutrophils and lymphocytes) and thrombocyte count was observed in the population. At later dates an increased excess relative risk of solid cancer incidence and mortality was found in the EURTC.",Excluded
1506,"Cancer of the parotid gland; Long-term follow-up. A single centre experience on recurrence and survival Background. The aim of the study was to investigate the results of treatment of malignant parotid gland tumours at a single centre during a 56 year period, focusing on tumour control and survival. Patients and methods. At Uppsala University Hospital, Sweden, 144 patients (73 male and 71 female) with parotid cancer were treated between 1948 and 2004. The mean and median ages were 62 and 65 years, respectively (range 1689 years). Surgery was the primary treatment in 113 (78%) patients followed by radiotherapy in 81. Postoperative radiotherapy in doses of 6466 Gy, where the intention was curative and delivered with either split course or not, was administered to a majority of patients after 1970. The split-course mode was practised between 1970 and 1989. The median follow-up time was 8.3 years for patients still alive. There were 57 (40%) relapses, of which 40 were local recurrences with 26 inside the treatment volume.Results. The overall 5-year survival was 53%. The majority of tumour-related deaths appeared in the first 3-5 years after diagnosis. Age, co-morbidity, the presence of lymph node metastases, adenoid cystic carcinoma and extent of disease were important for outcome; gender, however, was not. We found no difference in the survival between patients following split course therapy versus continuous fractionation. No difference could be seen in the survival of patients treated in the 1970s versus the 1990s. Conclusions. Age, nodal engagement, a higher T-stage, adenoid cystic carcinoma histopathology, facial palsy and intercurrent disease worsen the outcome of patients, whereas gender does not. Treatment principles at our hospital have been surgery followed by radiotherapy since the early 1970s even though a split course technique was practised during a part of this period. Survival has not improved markedly. Thus, there is scope for improvement for this group of patients.",Excluded
321,"Longstanding symptomatic choroidal hemangioma managed with limited PDT as initial or salvage therapy Purpose: To describe the use of limited, low-irradiance, single-spot photodynamic therapy (PDT) with verteporfin for the treatment of symptomatic choroidal hemangiomas. Method(s): Thirteen consecutive patients with a circumscribed choroidal hemangioma were treated with limited PDT 6 min following a 1-min infusion with verteporfin (6 mg/m2 body surface area), using a diode laser (692 nm) and a single spot large enough to cover only the most prominent part of the tumor. Exposure time was 166 s in the first three patients and 83 s in the last ten patients, resulting in a radiance exposure of respectively 100 and 50 J/cm2. Result(s): In all 11 not previously conventionally treated patients, visual acuity improved following PDT treatment. The two remaining patients with prior radiation treatment both reported widening of the visual field and sharper vision, but did not show an increase in ETDRS vision. In all but four patients the tumor became ultrasonographically undetectable by the first follow-up visit at 6 weeks, with only a slight irregularity at the level of the previous tumor remaining. In four patients the residual tumor was still detectable, and they received a second treatment, following which the tumor flattened completely. In all patients the retinal detachment disappeared. Conclusion(s): The present series demonstrates that even limited, low-irradiance, single-spot photodynamic therapy with verteporfin is an effective first-line treatment for choroidal hemangiomas.",Excluded
1755,"""Beach Lifeguards' Sun Exposure and Sun Protection in Spain"" Background: Sunburn is the main avoidable cause of skin cancer. Beach lifeguards spend many hours exposed to the effects of solar radiation during their work day, precisely at times of the year when levels of solar irradiation are highest. The aim of this study is to quantify the risk to beach lifeguards of sun exposure. Method(s): A descriptive cross-sectional study was carried out in the Western Costa del Sol, southern Spain, during the summer of 2018. The research subjects were recruited during a skin cancer prevention course for beach lifeguards. All participants were invited to complete a questionnaire on their habits, attitudes, and knowledge related to sun exposure. In addition, ten were specially monitored using personal dosimeters for three consecutive days, and the results were recorded in a photoprotection diary. A descriptive analysis (mean and standard deviation for the quantitative variables) was performed, and inter-group differences were evaluated using the Mann-Whitney U test. Result(s): Two hundred fifteen lifeguards completed the questionnaire, and 109 met the criteria for inclusion in this analysis. The mean age was 23.8 years (SD: 5.1), 78.0% were male, 71.5% were phototype III or IV (Fitzpatrick's phototype), and 77.1% had experienced at least one painful sunburn during the previous summer. The mean daily personal ultraviolet exposure per day, the minimal erythema dose, and the standard erythema dose, in J/m2, were 634.7 [standard deviation (SD): 356.2], 2.5 (SD: 1.4) and 6.35 (SD: 3.6), respectively. Conclusion(s): Beach lifeguards receive very high doses of solar radiation during the work day and experience correspondingly high rates of sunburn. Intervention strategies to modify their sun exposure behavior and working environment are necessary to reduce the risk of skin cancer for these workers and to promote early diagnosis of the disease.Copyright © 2020 The Authors",Excluded
2205,"Postoperative radiotherapy-induced morbidity in rectal cancer OBJECTIVES: We analyzed long-term morbidity and bowel function alteration after postoperative radiotherapy for rectal cancer following resection with anastomosis., PATIENTS AND METHODS: Thirty-seven patients who underwent surgery with intention to cure and a minimal follow-up period of 3 years were included. These patients were divided into two groups: in the first group, 14 patients received postoperative chemo-radiotherapy, 5-fluorouracil plus folinic acid, and 45 Gy plus 5 Gy boost. In the second group, there were 23 patients regarded as controls. We designed a questionnaire about their bowel function and analyzed the morbidity detected in their follow-up., RESULTS: The group that was treated with postoperative chemo-radiotherapy had more daily bowel movements (p = 0.03) and night-time movements (p = 0.04); incontinence (69.2 vs. 17.4% in the control group; p = 0.002), and perianal skin irritation (p = 0.04) versus the control group. Although without meaningful differences, the group under treatment wore a pad more often, had more defecatory urgency, could distinguish worse gas from stool, and needed more frequently antidiarrheal measures. Major complications were present in 28.6% of the under-treatment group: three intestinal resections were performed due to actinic stenosis; one patient had a residual stercoral fistula; another had several occlusive crises solved with medical treatment., CONCLUSIONS: Postoperative chemo-radiotherapy had a high morbidity rate, which determined a significant alteration in quality of life. Accuracy in indication is therefore necessary, as well as a consideration of other alternatives for treatment, such as preoperative chemo-radiotherapy and total mesorectal excision.",Excluded
2778,"Evaluation of rodent spaceflight in the NASA animal enclosure module for an extended operational period (Up to 35 days) The National Aeronautics and Space Administration Animal Enclosure Module (AEM) was developed as a self-contained rodent habitat for shuttle flight missions that provides inhabitants with living space, food, water, ventilation, and lighting, and this study reports whether, after minimal hardware modification, the AEM could support an extended term up to 35 days for Sprague-Dawley rats and C57BL/6 female mice for use on the International Space Station. Success was evaluated based on comparison of AEM housed animals to that of vivarium housed and to normal biological ranges through various measures of animal health and well-being, including animal health evaluations, animal growth and body masses, organ masses, rodent food bar consumption, water consumption, and analysis of blood contents. The results of this study confirmed that the AEMs could support 12 adult female C57BL/6 mice for up to 35 days with self-contained RFB and water, and the AEMs could also support 5 adult male Sprague-Dawley rats for 35 days with external replenishment of diet and water. This study has demonstrated the capability and flexibility of the AEM to operate for up to 35 days with minor hardware modification.

3048,"A hybrid iterative reconstruction algorithm that improves the image quality of low-tube-voltage coronary CT angiography OBJECTIVE: We investigated whether a hybrid iterative reconstruction (HIR) algorithm improves image quality at low-tube-voltage coronary CT angiography (CTA) compared with filtered back projection (FBP)., SUBJECTS AND METHODS: Eighteen patients (seven men, 11 women; mean age, 67.8 years) underwent retrospectively gated coronary CTA at 80 kV with a volume CT dose index (CTDI(vol)) of 18.8 mGy on a 64-MDCT scanner. CT images were reconstructed using only FBP and only HIR. For each patient, CT images subjected to the two different reconstructions were reviewed by two observers. Quantitative image quality parameters-that is, CT attenuation (HU) of the coronary arteries, image noise, and contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR)-were calculated and compared for the two reconstruction methods and the overall image quality for each reconstruction was visually scored on a 5-point scale., RESULTS: The mean estimated effective radiation dose for 80-kV coronary CTA was 4.7 +/- 0.4 (SD) mSv. The two reconstruction methods did not significantly differ with respect to the CT attenuation of the coronary arteries. The image noise was significantly lower with HIR than with FBP (20.3 +/- 5.3 vs 49.4 +/- 12.0 HU, respectively; p < 0.01), and the CNR was significantly higher with HIR than with FBP (29.8 +/- 7.4 vs 12.7 +/- 2.9, p < 0.01). The visual scores for image quality were higher with HIR than with FBP (p < 0.01)., CONCLUSION: The HIR algorithm can reduce image noise and improve image quality at low-tube-voltage coronary CTA.",Excluded
1761,"Molecular and cellular profiling of acute responses to total body radiation exposure in ovariectomized female cynomolgus macaques Purpose: The threat of radiation exposure requires a mechanistic understanding of radiation-induced immune injury and recovery. The study objective was to evaluate responses to ionizing radiation in ovariectomized (surgically post-menopausal) female cynomolgus macaques. Material(s) and Method(s): Animals received a single total-body irradiation (TBI) exposure at doses of 0, 2 or 5 Gy with scheduled necropsies at 5 days, 8 weeks and 24 weeks post-exposure. Blood and lymphoid tissues were evaluated for morphologic, cellular, and molecular responses. Result(s): Irradiated animals developed symptoms of acute hematopoietic syndrome, and reductions in thymus weight, thymopoiesis, and bone marrow cellularity. Acute, transient increases in plasma monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 (MCP1) were observed in 5 Gy animals along with dose-dependent alterations in messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) signatures in thymus, spleen, and lymph node. Expression of T cell markers was lower in thymus and spleen, while expression of macrophage marker CD68 (cluster of differentiation 68) was relatively elevated in lymphoid tissues from irradiated animals. Conclusion(s): Ovariectomized female macaques exposed to moderate doses of radiation experienced increased morbidity, including acute, dose-dependent alterations in systemic and tissue-specific biomarkers, and increased macrophage/T cell ratios. The effects on mortality exceeded expectations based on previous studies in males, warranting further investigation.Copyright © 2015 Informa UK, Ltd.",Excluded

OBJECTIVE: To determine whether the amount of tagged stool and fluid significantly affects the radiation exposure in low-dose screening CT colonography performed with an automatic tube-current modulation technique., METHODS: The study included 311 patients. The tagging agent was barium (n = 271) or iodine (n = 40). Correlation was measured between mean volume CT dose index (CTDI (vol)) and the estimated x-ray attenuation of the tagged stool and fluid (ATT). Multiple linear regression analyses were performed to determine the effect of ATT on CTDI (vol ) and the effect of ATT on image noise while adjusting for other variables including abdominal circumference., RESULTS: CTDI (vol) varied from 0.88 to 2.54 mGy. There was no significant correlation between CTDI (vol) and ATT (p = 0.61). ATT did not significantly affect CTDI (vol) (p = 0.93), while abdominal circumference was the only factor significantly affecting CTDI (vol) (p < 0.001). Image noise ranged from 59.5 to 64.1 HU. The p value for the regression model explaining the noise was 0.38., CONCLUSION: The amount of stool and fluid tagging does not significantly affect radiation exposure.",Excluded

We conducted a prospective cohort study of 100 patients, who underwent unilateral (group U) or bilateral (group B) instrumented one-level LLIF for degenerative lumbar disease. Forty-one patients in group U were undergoing unilateral pedicle screw instrumentation, and 59 patients in group B were undergoing bilateral pedicle screw instrumentation. Clinical characteristic and demographic data before surgery were compared. The intraoperative data, including operative time with changes in positions, intraoperative blood loss, and X-ray exposure time, as well as the perioperative data, including postoperative hospital stay and clinical and radiographic data were compared. As a result, Group U required a significantly shorter operating time than group B. The subsidence grade and fusion rates exhibited no significant differences in the postoperative radiographic evaluation. Group U had better results in clinical assessments than group B.

2583,"Variation in quantitative CT air trapping in heavy smokers on repeat CT examinations Objectives: To determine the variation in quantitative computed tomography (CT) measures of air trapping in lowdose chest CTs of heavy smokers. Method(s): We analysed 45 subjects from a lung cancer screening trial, examined by CT twice within 3 months. Inspiratory and expiratory low-dose CT was obtained using breath hold instructions. CT air trapping was defined as the percentage of voxels in expiratory CT with an attenuation below -856 HU (EXP-856) and the expiratory to inspiratory ratio of mean lung density (E/I-ratio MLD). Variation was determined using limits of agreement, defined as 1.96 times the standard deviation of the mean difference. The effect of both lung volume correction and breath hold reproducibility was determined. Result(s): The limits of agreement for uncorrected CT air trapping measurements were -15.0 to 11.7 % (EXP-856) and -9.8 to 8.0 % (E/I-ratioMLD). Good breath hold reproducibility significantly narrowed the limits for EXP -856 (-10.7 to 7.5 %, P=0.002), but not for E/I-ratioMLD (-9.2 to 7.9 %, P=0.75). Statistical lung volume correction did not improve the limits for EXP-856 (-12.5 to 8.8 %, P=0.12) and E/Iratio MLD (-7.5 to 5.8 %, P=0.17). Conclusion(s): Quantitative air trapping measures on lowdose CT of heavy smokers show considerable variation on repeat CT examinations, regardless of lung volume correction or reproducible breath holds. Key Points: * Computed tomography quantitatively measures small airways disease in heavy smokers. * Measurements of air trapping vary considerably on repeat CT examinations. * Variation remains substantial even with reproducible breath holds and lung volume correction. © The Author(s) 2012.",Excluded
2847,"Radioimmunoguided-intraoperative radiation therapy in colorectal carcinoma: A new technique to precisely define the clinical target volume Purpose: The clinical target volume (CTV) to be irradiated by intraoperative radiation therapy (IORT) after resection is generally based on the surgeon's estimation of close margins. We have developed a new technique, radioimmunoguided-intraoperative radiation therapy (RIG-IORT), that uses an intraoperative hand-held gamma-detecting probe to define areas of residual microscopic disease containing radiolabeled monoclonal antibodies to tumor associated antigen, to more precisely delineate the CTV for IORT. Methods and Materials: Patients were injected i.v. with 2 mCi 125I-radiolabeled CC49 antibody approximately 3 weeks before surgery. They then underwent radioimmunoguided surgery (RIGS) with maximal resection of tumor. A hand- held gamma-detecting probe (Neoprobe 1000) was used intraoperatively to detect and resect areas of high radioactivity, representing tumor. Areas with persistently high probe counts after resection were the areas of occult residual disease, and represented the CTV to be irradiated. The IORT was given with either 6-9 MeV electron beam from a dedicated linear accelerator, or with high-dose-rate brachytherapy from a remote afterloader. If all RIGS- positive tissue had been resected, or if widely disseminated disease remained, the patient was not considered for IORT. Result(s): This technique was used in 31 patients with colorectal adenocarcinoma recurrent into the pelvis (n = 23) or paraortic nodes (n = 8). The CTV for IORT was delineated by increased RIGS count in 13 of 19 patients (68%) with microscopic residual, and in 11 of 12 patients (92%) with gross residual. In the other 7 patients, the tumor area did not accumulate the radiolabeled antibody; therefore, these tumor beds were irradiated based on the surgeon's estimation of close margins. Hence, overall, the RIG-IORT technique was used to define the tumor bed for IORT in 24 of 31 patients (77%). This technical report focuses on the development of the RIG-IORT technique and does not address the outcome results of the treated patients. Conclusion(s): A new technique, RIG-IORT, which uses radiolabeled monoclonal antibodies to precisely determine the CTV for IORT, is described. Whether the use of this technique will lead to improved tumor control will only be known upon the outcome analysis of RIG-IORT- treated patients compared with those obtained using traditional IORT techniques.",Excluded
654,"Is computed tomography cystography indicated in children with pelvic fractures? Purpose: Pelvic fracture evaluation with abdominopelvic computed tomography (CT) and formal CT cystography for rule out of urine bladder injury have been commonly employed in pediatric trauma patients. The additional delayed imaging required to obtain optimal CT cystography is, however, associated with increased doses of ionizing radiation to pelvic organs and represent a significant risk in the pediatric population for future carcinogenic risk. We hypothesized that avoidance of routine CT cystography among pediatric pelvic fracture victims would not result in an appreciable rate of missed bladder injuries and would aid in mitigating the radiation exposure risk associated with these additional images. Method(s): A retrospective cohort study involving blunt trauma pelvic fractures among pediatric trauma patients (age<14) between the years 1997 and 2016 was conducted utilizing the Israeli National Trauma Registry. Statistical analysis was performed using SAS statistical software version 9.4 via the tests of Chi-square test and two-sided Fisher's exact test. A p value of less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Result(s): A total of 1072 children were identified from the registry for inclusion. Mean age of patients was 7.7 years (range 0-14) and 713 (66.5%) were male. Overall mortality in this population was 4.1% (44/1072). Only 2.1% (23) of pediatric patients with pelvic fractures had bladder injury identified, with just 9 children having intraperitoneal bladder rupture (0.8% of all the patients).

684,"Facial involvement in indian psoriatic patients and its association with disease severity and metabolic syndrome-a cross-sectional study Introduction: Face was often thought to be spared in psoriasis possibly due to the protective effect of sebum and low-dose ambient UV radiation exposure. Few have suggested that facial involvement is common and indicates disease severity. There is a paucity of data on this, particularly from India. Psoriatics have a higher prevalence of metabolic syndrome (MetS) and, patients with severe disease are at greater risk. Objective(s): We decided to study the frequency, type of facial involvement in Indian psoriatic patients and its association with disease severity and MetS. Material(s) and Method(s): 250 consecutive psoriatic patients were enrolled. Facial psoriatics were divided into peripherofacial(PF), centrofacial(CF) and mixed facial(MF) types. Disease severity was assessed using whole body, scalp, facial Psoriasis area severity index (PASI) scores and Nail area psoriasis severity index (NAPSI) scores. Patients were evaluated for the presence of MetS using NCEP-III criteria. All parameters were compared both between facial and non-facial psoriatics and, between cases with different types of face involvement. Result(s): The mean age(p-0.04) and age of onset of disease(p-0.02) was lower and median whole body PASI score higher(p<0.001) in psoriatics with facial involvement than those without. No significant association was found between facial involvement and MetS. MF was the commonest type of facial involvement and there was a significant association of mixed facial involvement with increased total body PASI and head PASI scores. (p<0.001). Conclusion(s): Facial involvement in psoriatics is associated with severe disease, but not metabolic syndrome. Mixed facial type might be considered a marker of overall psoriasis disease severity in the Indian population.",Excluded
9,"Integration of magnetoencephalography-generated functional brain maps into dose planning during arteriovenous malformation radiosurgery BACKGROUND: Magnetoencephalography (MEG) can delineate critical regions of the cortex and facilitate conformal stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) dose planning. Despite the substantial role of Gamma Knife R SRS in arteriovenous malformation (AVM) management, MEG-generated maps of critical regions have never been utilized to improve dose planning., PURPOSE: To assess the value of integrating functional brain mapping using MEG with dose planning during treatment of brain AVMs with SRS., METHODS: This case series encompassed 5 patients with motor region AVMs. Noninvasive eloquent cortex mapping was achieved using a whole-head 306-channel Neuromag R Vectorview MEG System 5-10 days before SRS. On the day of SRS, the functional brain maps were integrated onto the intraoperative dose planning magnetic resonance imaging for Leksell GammaPlan R version 10. The median AVM volume treated was 12.7 cm(3), and 18 Gy was the median margin dose., RESULTS: Functional image integration of MEG improved the recognition of critical brain structures adjacent to the AVM. This facilitated anatomical planning designed to reduce the dose to adjacent critical structures while maintaining a therapeutic dose to the AVM target. The 5 patients had no adverse radiation effects during the follow-up., CONCLUSION: Coregistration of MEG data improves the accuracy and dose sparing needed for optimal planning during Gamma Knife SRS.

2403,"Differentiation of functionally active mouse T lymphocytes from functionally inactive bone marrow precursors II. Limited recovery of T-cell responses from mouse bone marrow in tissue culture The limited differentiation of mature T cell function from mouse bone marrow in tissue culture is described and compared with similar differentiation occuring in vivo in irradiated bone marrow protected mice. Data are presented to show that a pool of precursors, similar in size to that able to produce early (transient?) regeneration in thymectomized recipients, is responsible for the development of mitogen responsive T cells active in MLC (proliferation) and CML (development of cytotoxic cells) assays. In contrast, a helper cell population which augments antibody formation from T-depleted normal spleen cells derives from a pool of similar precursors yet does not seem to be theta positive. Similarly, larger cells (perhaps typical of those giving rise to suppressor T cells in vivo) give rise to a suppressor cell pool after 4 days of culture, though again only a fraction of this suppressor activity could be attributed to theta positive cells. It is suggested that much of the data for regenration of T lymphocytes in vitro from T-depleted sources needs to be re-interpreted in terms of this evidence for a pool of post-thymic precursors of T cells in such T-deficient cell populations.",Excluded
1527,"DNA damage and repair: fruit and vegetable effects in a feeding trial Epidemiologic studies have examined the association between fruit and vegetable (F&V) consumption and the risk of cancer. Several cancer-preventive mechanisms have been proposed, such as antioxidant properties and modulation of biotransformation enzyme activities; both may be associated with reducing DNA damage and hence the mutation rate. We investigated, in a randomized, controlled, crossover feeding trial, the effect of 10 servings/day of botanically defined F&V for 2 wk on endogenous DNA damage; resistance to gamma -irradiation damage; and DNA repair capacity in lymphocytes, measured by the Comet assay. We also explored the association between the UGT1A1*28 polymorphism and serum bilirubin concentrations and DNA damage and repair measures. Healthy men (n = 11) and women (n = 17), age 20 to 40 yr, provided blood samples at the end of each feeding period. Overall, F&V did not affect DNA damage and repair measures in lymphocytes. The number of UGT1A1*28 alleles was inversely associated with sensitivity to gamma -irradiation exposure and DNA repair capacity, but a biological mechanism to explain this association is unclear. A larger sample size is needed to investigate the association between bilirubin concentrations and endogenous DNA damage. With inconsistent findings in the literature, additional dietary intervention studies on the effect of F&V on DNA damage and repair are needed.",Excluded
2391,"Innate immune responses of Drosophila melanogaster are altered by spaceflight Alterations and impairment of immune responses in humans present a health risk for space exploration missions. The molecular mechanisms underpinning innate immune defense can be confounded by the complexity of the acquired immune system of humans. Drosophila (fruit fly) innate immunity is simpler, and shares many similarities with human innate immunity at the level of molecular and genetic pathways. The goals of this study were to elucidate fundamental immune processes in Drosophila affected by spaceflight and to measure host-pathogen responses post-flight. Five containers, each containing ten female and five male fruit flies, were housed and bred on the space shuttle (average orbit altitude of 330.35 km) for 12 days and 18.5 hours. A new generation of flies was reared in microgravity. In larvae, the immune system was examined by analyzing plasmatocyte number and activity in culture. In adults, the induced immune responses were analyzed by bacterial clearance and quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) of selected genes following infection with E. coli. The RNA levels of relevant immune pathway genes were determined in both larvae and adults by microarray analysis. The ability of larval plasmatocytes to phagocytose E. coli in culture was attenuated following spaceflight, and in parallel, the expression of genes involved in cell maturation was downregulated. In addition, the level of constitutive expression of pattern recognition receptors and opsonins that specifically recognize bacteria, and of lysozymes, antimicrobial peptide (AMP) pathway and immune stress genes, hallmarks of humoral immunity, were also reduced in larvae. In adults, the efficiency of bacterial clearance measured in vivo following a systemic infection with E. coli post-flight, remained robust. We show that spaceflight altered both cellular and humoral immune responses in Drosophila and that the disruption occurs at multiple interacting pathways.",Excluded
1380,"[UV risk perception by the general public: results of a representative questionnaire in Germany] For public health promotion purposes it is important to know how the general public perceives the risk factor ""UV exposure"" and how UV risk perception is connected to health-related attitudes and beliefs. The aim of the study was to collect representative data about UV risk perception in Germany. A representative telephone survey using the ADM design was carried out among 1 501 German residents between May and July 2007. Variables related to UV risk knowledge, relevance of risk topics in every-day thinking and risk estimates were investigated. Data regarding a subjective benefit evaluation of UV exposition was also collected. The results suggest no essential gaps in the general knowledge about UV risks, except for the underestimation of UV-related cataracts. The respondents thought it extremely likely that UV exposure would cause health damage such as skin cancer, photoaging or sun burns. People were asked to report how often they had thought about a number of health risks including UV risks in the last two weeks. It was established that UV risks are present but not dominant in people's every-day thinking. Along with it, the risk evaluation proves to be rather moderate. The mean value for respondents' perceived personal risk is M=5.1, in the midsection of the given 10-point scale. The results show that perceived personal risk is not influenced by the serious UV health risks such as cancer or cataracts. The results also indicate that UV benefit and UV risk perception are not strongly related to one another. In summary, participants' perception and assessment of the various health risks of UV exposure seem to be realistic, but the UV risk assessment it is not related to the perception of personal risk. One must therefore assume that UV health risk information and education campaigns do not necessarily lead to a change in the perception of personal UV risk. Rather than addressing primarily risk knowledge, UV risk communication should focus more on motivational aspects and consider the role of UV benefit perception. © Georg Thieme Verlag KG Stuttgart .

3129,"Radiation-induced coronary artery disease Excessive unprotected radiation to the heart appears to lead to the development of CAD, even in the absence of significant cardiovascular risk factors. The coexistence of such factors may enhance the probability of CAD. The presence of hypercholesterolemia and concomitant or sequential use of chemotherapeutic agents (especially doxorubicin) could further increase this risk. Therapeutic decisions, as with any other manifestation of CAD, relate to the extent of myocardium at jeopardy and to the overall diffuseness of CAD. Management options possible are PTCA or coronary artery bypass surgery. The latter may be required in left main artery stenosis and complicated ostial lesions. Use of shielding should decrease the associated risk of radiation-induced CAD in future years. However, clinicians should continue to have a high degree of suspicion of CAD in patients treated with thoracic radiation without cardiac shielding.",Excluded

851,"The effect of chronic low-level exposure on hair damages of radiation workers According to chronic exposure of radiation workers during their work experience,this study was an attempt to assess the damage caused by radiation on the hair of radiation workers. In this study the total Skin and Hair Analyzing System capable of registering polarized images was used for measuring hair parameters (hair thickness,hair root,hair nutrition,hair status and hair oil). Hair management software ,Skin Management Software and also 150X,700X lenses were used to measure the hair parameters. The study included one questionnaire which it's face validity and content validity was approved by pilot study and some professional experts. The participants were 152 hospital personnel and were divided into radiation exposed group (radiotherapy technicians,nuclear medicine technicians) and control group (nurses) and were homogenized based on age,work situation,work time,work experience and baldness (family history). Results showed that chronic exposure causes the reduction of hair thickness in female radiation workers than nurses. The hair root,hair nutrition,hair status and hair oil in groups showed no significant difference to each other. However,there was no significant difference in hair parameters between male radiation workers and male non radiation workers. Although attention to safety in working with radiation has increased,damage caused by radiation has not yet been reduced to zero. Results of the study showed that chronic exposure may cause damage to the hair of radiation workers. The reason may be inadequate training of technologists and their high workload.Copyright © 2016,International Journal of Pharmacy and Technology. All rights reserved.",Included
3595,"Multidrug resistance determinants in acute myeloid leukemia developed in persons exposed to ionizing radiation due to the Chernobyl accident The results of multidrug resistance determinants expression analysis on leukemic cells of 56 acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients by immunophenotyping are presented. Of these, there were 21 persons exposed to ionizing radiation due to the Chemobyl accident with radiation-associated AML and 35 patients with spontaneous leukemia. The aim of this study was to determine if transport proteins (P-glycoprotein, LRP, and MDR1), apoptosis-related proteins (Fas, Bcl-2, Bax, p53, and Bcl-X(L)), and topoisomerase IIalpha expression in AML patients with the history of radiation exposure differed from those in spontaneous AML cases. Leukemic cells in patients with radiation-associated diseases compared to spontaneous AML more often overexpressed antiapoptotic oncoprotein Bcl-2 (12/21 vs. 6/35, p < 0.005) and less often demonstrated expression of Fas receptor (12/21 vs. 30/35, p < 0.05). Moreover, leukemic cells were simultaneously Fas negative and Bcl-2 positive in 4 out of 21 patients exposed to ionizing radiation but none of spontaneous cases had similar phenotype (p < 0.05). Leukemic cells in patients with radiation-associated AML compared to spontaneous cases more often were P-glycoprotein positive (12/20 vs 9/31, p < 0.05). P-glycoprotein overexpression significantly correlated with resistant disease in patients with radiation-associated AML (r = 0.47, p < 0.05), but was not a prognostic variable for the treatment outcome in terms of overall survival. Defects in pathways of drug-induced apoptosis and function of pump, that actively effluxes drugs could contribute significantly to developing drug resistance in radiation-associated AML.",Included
3517,"X-ray radiation and developmental inhibition of Drosophila suzukii (Matsumura) (Diptera: Drosophilidae) PURPOSE: Different doses of X-ray radiation were tested to assess the developmental inhibition effects on different stages of Drosophila suzukii, spotted wing drosophila (SWD). Efficacy of a potential quarantine treatment dose was evaluated for its practicality by a small scale-up validation test at a commercial facility., MATERIALS AND METHODS: X-ray treatments at different doses of 50, 100, 200, and 300 Gy were carried out with eggs, larvae, pupae and adults of SWD. The trial at the commercial facility was performed with pupae at 150 Gy., RESULTS: X-ray radiation inhibited development of all stages of SWD, and the estimated dose to cause 99% mortality or to prevent emergence (ED99) are reported here. Irradiation to eggs inhibited hatching, pupariation and adult emergence at 1962, 649 and 31 Gy, respectively. The inhibition of irradiated larvae to adult emergence was 66 Gy. Irradiation to pupae could not inhibit adult emergence completely even at 300 Gy. However, irradiation at 100 Gy and above induced complete adult sterility. Irradiation to pupae inhibited hatching of F1 eggs at 73 Gy, while for adults, total inhibition of F1 egg hatching was observed at 822 Gy. In the trial at the commercial facility, radiation at 150 Gy to pupae induced complete adult sterility in all combinations of cross-mating between treated or untreated males and females., CONCLUSION: This study suggests that X-ray radiation can be recommended as an alternative to methyl bromide as phytosanitary treatment for quarantine purpose.",Included
747,"Dose-escalation with CHARTWEL (continuous hyperfractionated accelerated radiotherapy week-end less) combined with neo-adjuvant chemotherapy in the treatment of locally advanced non-small cell lung cancer PURPOSE: a radiation-dose-escalation study was undertaken to assess the therapeutic benefit of combining accelerated hyperfractionated radiotherapy (RT) with neo-adjuvant chemotherapy (CT) in non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC)., MATERIALS AND METHODS: One hundred and thirteen patients with locally advanced NSCLC were entered into a phase II trial of CHARTWEL (CHART Week-End-Less) 54 Gy or 60 Gy with or without three cycles of CT. Acute oesophageal reactions and analgesia were scored for up to 8 weeks after the start of RT. Pneumonitis, lung fibrosis, spinal cord and oesophageal strictures, were assessed using clinical and radiological criteria from 3 months onwards and throughout the study. Haematological and gastrointestinal toxicity was monitored in those patients undergoing CT. Endpoints for treatment outcome were overall survival, disease-free survival and loco-regional control., RESULTS: Chemotherapy enhanced the incidence and duration of acute dysphagia,but the increase was transient. Healing occurred in all cases and there has been no evidence of long-term oesophageal complications. Clinically, almost 25% of those receiving CT+RT had Grade 2 pneumonitis, higher than seen with RT alone. However, the 1 patient with severe Grade 3 pneumonitis was in the RT 60 Gy alone group. An incidence of 17% Grade 2 pulmonary fibrosis at 2 years was seen with CT, slightly lower than with RT alone. To date, there is no evidence of Grade 3 lung fibrosis. There was a higher scoring of lung damage with the radiological endpoint, which gave no indication that CT increased pulmonary toxicity over that of RT alone. Loco-regional control at 2 years was 37% and 55% for CHARTWEL 54 Gy and 60 Gy alone compared with 72% in those treated with 60 Gy and neo-adjuvant CT However, this did not translate into a survival advantage., CONCLUSIONS: This study of CHARTWEL combined with induction chemotherapy, has shown that the strategy is feasible and that a possible therapeutic benefit may be obtained by the addition of CT. Although neo-adjuvant treatment increased acute mucosal reactions and slight-to-moderate pneumonitis seen with CHARTWEL 60 Gy, the clinical management and quality of life of these patients is similar to those treated with radiotherapy alone.",Excluded
2994,"Bone and joint modeling from 3D ankle MRI: Feasibility and comparisonwith radiographs and 2D MRI Purpose: To evaluate feasibility of creating segmented joint models (bone surface reconstructed x-ray) from 3D isotropic ankle MRI, assess various angular and joint space measurements on models and compare with corresponding radiographs and 2D MRI measurements, and determine differences in time consumption for performing the measurements. Material(s) and Method(s): Under HIPPAA compliance, consecutive series of 27 subjects with 3D ankle MRI isotropic data sets (0.65 mm voxel, fast spin echo, proton density weighted sequence) performed on 3 T scanners were used. Three subjects with incomplete x-ray series were excluded. Thus, a total of 24 subjects, 11 left and 13 right ankles, were included in the study, of which 8 were male and 16 females. Age ranged from 17 to 73 with mean of 46 years. Segmented joint models (bone surface reconstructed x-rays) were created on all isotropic MR data sets by one observer. Three readers independently performed various blinded angular and joint space measurements on the models, corresponding 2D MRI, and radiographs (XR) at study inception and 8 weeks later. Means and standard deviations were calculated. Paired t-tests were performed for each pair (XR vs. 2D, XR vs. 3D and 2D vs. 3D) within each parameter. P values less than 0.05 were considered as statistically significant and box plots were generated. Spearman correlation coefficient between measurements was performed to assess Inter-reader agreement. Interclass correlation and time difference analysis was performed. Result(s): 3D segmentation models resembling x-ray were successfully created in all cases within 20 (+/-5) minutes. Good agreement (ICC > 0.65) between all reader measurements was noted across all modalities with the exception of measuring the Talocural angle (3D, 2D, XR), talar pitch (3D), and tibibofibular clear space (2D), which showed weak to poor correlation. Time consumption was significantly greater (p < 0.05) on 2D vs 3D for all measurements except lateral clear space and medial tibiotalar concavity assessments. Time consumption was noted to be significantly greater (p < 0.05) on XR as compared to 3D for nearly half the measurements (5 of 11) for each reader. Conclusion(s): 3D bone and joint segmentation models resembling x-ray are feasible from isotropic ankle MRI data sets, which might lead to possibility of automated measurements by computer in future. While good correlation was noted between all readers, absolute measurement values were significantly different between modalities. The differences in absolute values is likely related to positioning variances (rotated x-ray mortise causing varied joint width, non-angle corrected 2D images, weight bearing vs non weight bearing, and the optimal positioning of reconstructed 3D image). Tighter collimation, a protocol variation, also limited evaluation in some cases by non-inclusion of reference points normally used with XR imaging and contributed to variance. Very good (ICC > 0.7) intrareader agreement was noted for most measurements with a few measurements showing moderate to good correlation (ICC > 0.5 to 0.65), Measurements on the 3D model of joint spaces was significantly faster when compared to 2D and generally faster than XR.",Excluded
1938,"Phase II study of preoperative helical tomotherapy with a simultaneous integrated boost for rectal cancer PURPOSE: The addition of concomitant chemotherapy to preoperative radiotherapy is considered the standard of care for patients with cT3-4 rectal cancer. The combined treatment modality increases the complete response rate and local control (LC), but has no impact on survival or the incidence of distant metastases. In addition, it is associated with considerable toxicity. As an alternative strategy, we explored prospectively, preoperative helical tomotherapy with a simultaneous integrated boost (SIB)., METHODS AND MATERIALS: A total of 108 patients were treated with intensity-modulated and image-guided radiotherapy using the Tomotherapy Hi-Art II system. A dose of 46 Gy, in daily fractions of 2 Gy, was delivered to the mesorectum and draining lymph nodes, without concomitant chemotherapy. Patients with an anticipated circumferential resection margin (CRM) of less than 2 mm, based on magnetic resonance imaging, received a SIB to the tumor up to a total dose of 55.2 Gy. Acute and late side effects were scored using the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events version 3.0., RESULTS: A total of 102 patients presented with cT3-4 tumors; 57 patients entered the boost group and 51 the no-boost group. One patient in the no-boost group developed a radio-hypersensitivity reaction, resulting in a complete tumor remission, a Grade 3 acute and Grade 5 late enteritis. No other Grade >=3 acute toxicities occurred. With a median follow-up of 32 months, Grade >=3 late gastrointestinal and urinary toxicity were observed in 6% and 4% of the patients, respectively. The actuarial 2-year LC, progression-free survival and overall survival were 98%, 79%, and 93%., CONCLUSIONS: Preoperative helical tomotherapy displays a favorable acute toxicity profile in patients with cT3-4 rectal cancer.

1998,"A Prospective Trial of Radiation Therapy Efficacy and Toxicity for Localized Mucosa-associated Lymphoid Tissue (MALT) Lymphoma Purpose: We report the long-term results of a prospective trial conducted to determine the efficacy and safety of radiation therapy (RT) alone in treating localized mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) lymphoma. Methods and Materials: Patients with localized MALT lymphoma were eligible and treated with involved field RT to doses of 24 to 39.6 Gy. Relapse-free survival (RFS) was the primary endpoint. Kaplan-Meier analysis was used to estimate RFS, progression-free survival (PFS), and overall survival (OS) defined from time of study entry. Preplanned subgroup analyses were performed based on site of involvement. Result(s): From 2000 to 2012, 75 patients were accrued; 73 received protocol-specified RT. Median follow-up was 9.8 years. Thirty-four patients had gastric MALT, 17 orbital, 13 head and neck nonorbit, 4 skin, and 5 disease of other sites. Thirteen of 34 patients with gastric MALT were Helicobacter pylori positive at the time of initial diagnosis and underwent 1 to 3 courses of triple antibiotic therapy. All gastric MALT patients had documented persistent MALT without H. pylori on endoscopy before enrollment in the study. All patients achieved a complete response with a median time of 3 months. Eleven patients (15%) had disease relapse, 9 of which were at sites outside the RT field with median time to progression of 38.3 months. Median PFS was 17.5 years, and median RFS and OS were not reached. The 10-year relapse-free rate was 83% (95% confidence interval [CI], 74%-93%). The 10-year PFS rate was 71% (95% CI, 60%-84%). The 10-year OS rate was 86% (95% CI, 77%-96%). RFS, PFS, and OS did not differ by disease site (P = .17,. 43, and. 50, respectively). All relapses were successfully salvaged. One patient developed metastatic gastric adenocarcinoma and was found to also have recurrent MALT on biopsy. Otherwise, all relapsed patients were alive without evidence of disease at last follow-up, and no patient died of MALT lymphoma. Sixty-seven patients (92%) experienced acute toxicity during radiation, all of which were grade 1 and 2, with only 1 grade 3 toxicity. Twenty-two patients (30%) experienced late toxicity, with only 1 grade 3 toxicity. Conclusion(s): This prospective study confirms that RT for MALT lymphoma provides excellent long-term RFS with acceptable rates of toxicity. Current efforts are focused on RT de-escalation in an effort to further avoid treatment-related morbidity. Clinicaltrials.gov: NCT04465162.Copyright © 2020",Excluded
3344,"Irradiation-resistance conferred by superoxide dismutase: possible adaptive role of a natural polymorphism in Drosophila melanogaster The toxic effects of ionizing radiation to DNA are thought to be due to the generation of the superoxide radical, 02-. Superoxide dismutase (SOD), which scavenges 02-., has been invoked as a protecting enzyme against ionizing radiation in viruses, bacteria, mammalian cells in culture, and live mice. We now demonstrate that SOD is involved in the resistance of Drosophila melanogaster against irradiation. The protection is greatest when flies carry the S form of the enzyme (which exhibits highest in vitro specific activity), intermediate when they carry the F form of the enzyme, and lowest when they are homozygous for N, an allele that reduces the amount of the enzyme to 3.5% of the normal level. Natural selection experiments show that the fitness of the high-activity S allele is increased in an irradiated population relative to the nonirradiated control. These results point towards a possible adaptive function of the S/F polymorphism found in natural populations of D. melanogaster.",Included

The three cyst populations experimented could be differentiated according to their development and survival rates. The variations observed for both of these criteria were related to the age of the cysts and the selection technique. The study of radiosensitivity based on LD50 value showed that the highest radiosensitivity differences were related to the cyst selection technique and not to the age. Furthermore, the three cyst populations showed that radio-induced lethal effects were enhanced, or appeared with time, namely following the delay between irradiation and the cyst development study. The observation of late effects after irradiations or after space flights show the difficulties encountered in assessing radiative risks during long duration space flights.",Excluded

The aim of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of cisplatin/capecitabine (XP) as an alternative with intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) in ASCC setting. Method(s): We retrospectively screened all patients with stage I-IV ASCC from January 2010 to June 2019. The records of patients who received definitive chemoradiation with cisplatin/capecitabine (XP) and IMRT were collected and analyzed. Result(s): The first patient was treated with XP in 2017, so totally 11 patients were included in our study from January 2017 to June 2019. All patients have experienced clinical complete response (cCR). After a median follow-up of 30 months (range, 18-39 months), no patient had local recurrence or distant metastasis. Two-year colostomy-free survival (CFS) and two-year disease-free survival (DFS) were both 100%. The median overall survival (OS) has not reached. Grade 3 acute toxicities included leukopenia (1, 9.1%), neutropenia (2, 18.2%) and thrombocytopenia (2, 18.2%). No grade 4 acute adverse events occurred.

1782,"Effect of radiation dose reduction and iterative reconstruction on computer-aided detection of pulmonary nodules: Intra-individual comparison OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effect of radiation dose reduction and iterative reconstruction (IR) on the performance of computer-aided detection (CAD) for pulmonary nodules., METHODS: In this prospective study twenty-five patients were included who were scanned for pulmonary nodule follow-up. Image acquisition was performed at routine dose and three reduced dose levels in a single session by decreasing mAs-values with 45%, 60% and 75%. Tube voltage was fixed at 120 kVp for patients >= 80 kg and 100 kVp for patients < 80 kg. Data were reconstructed with filtered back projection (FBP), iDose(4) (levels 1,4,6) and IMR (levels 1-3). All noncalcified solid pulmonary nodules >= 4 mm identified by two radiologists in consensus served as the reference standard. Subsequently, nodule volume was measured with CAD software and compared to the reference consensus. The numbers of true-positives, false-positives and missed pulmonary nodules were evaluated as well as the sensitivity., RESULTS: Median effective radiation dose was 2.2 mSv at routine dose and 1.2, 0.9 and 0.6 mSv at respectively 45%, 60% and 75% reduced dose. A total of 28 pulmonary nodules were included. With FBP at routine dose, 89% (25/28) of the nodules were correctly identified by CAD. This was similar at reduced dose levels with FBP, iDose(4) and IMR. CAD resulted in a median number of false-positives findings of 11 per scan with FBP at routine dose (93% of the CAD marks) increasing to 15 per scan with iDose(4) (95% of the CAD marks) and 26 per scan (96% of the CAD marks) with IMR at the lowest dose level., CONCLUSION: CAD can identify pulmonary nodules at submillisievert dose levels with FBP, hybrid and model-based IR. However, the number of false-positive findings increased using hybrid and especially model-based IR at submillisievert dose while dose reduction did not affect the number of false-positives with FBP.

984,"Prognostic factors and prevention of radioembolization-induced liver disease UNLABELLED: Radioembolization (RE)-induced liver disease (REILD) has been defined as jaundice and ascites appearing 1 to 2 months after RE in the absence of tumor progression or bile duct occlusion. Our aims were to study the incidence of REILD in a large cohort of patients and the impact of a series of changes introduced in the processes of treatment design, activity calculation, and the routine use of ursodeoxycholic acid and low-dose steroids (modified protocol). Between 2003 and 2011, 260 patients with liver tumors treated by RE were studied (standard protocol: 75, modified protocol: 185). REILD appeared only in patients with cirrhosis or in noncirrhosis patients exposed to systemic chemotherapy prior to RE. Globally, the incidence of REILD was reduced in the modified protocol group from 22.7% to 5.4% and the incidence of severe REILD from 13.3% to 2.2% (P<0.0001). Treatment efficacy was not jeopardized since 3-month disease control rates were virtually identical in both groups (66.7% and 67.2%, P=0.93). Exposure to chemotherapy in the 2-month period following RE and being treated by the standard protocol were independent predictors of REILD among noncirrhosis patients. In cirrhosis, the presence of a small liver (total volume<1.5 L), an abnormal bilirubin (>1.2 mg/dL), and treatment in a selective fashion were independently associated with REILD., CONCLUSION: REILD is an uncommon but relevant complication that appears when liver tissue primed by cirrhosis or prior and subsequent chemotherapy is exposed to the radiation delivered by radioactive microspheres. We designed a comprehensive treatment protocol that reduces the frequency and the severity of REILD. Copyright © 2012 American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases.",Excluded

2146,"The age-dependent effect of high-dose X-ray radiation on NFkappaB signaling, structure, and mechanical behavior of the intervertebral disc Purpose: Ionizing radiation damages tissue and provokes inflammatory responses in multiple organ systems. We investigated the effects of high-dose X-ray radiation on the molecular inflammation and mechanical function of the intervertebral disc (IVD). Methods: Functional spine units (FSUs) containing the vertebrae-IVDs-vertebrae structure extracted from 1-month, 6-month, and 16-month-old NFkappaB-luciferase reporter mice and from 6-month-old myeloid differentiation factor 88 (MyD88)-null mice. After a preconditioning period in culture, the FSUs were subjected a single dose of ionizing X-ray radiation at 20 Gys, and then NFkappaB expression was monitored. The IVDs were then subjected to mechanical testing using dynamic compression, glycosaminoglycan (GAG) quantification, and histological analyses. Results: In the 1-month-old FSUs, the NFkappaB-driven luciferase activity was significantly elevated for 1 day following the exposure to radiation. The 6-month-old FSUs showed increased NFkappaB activity for 3 days, while the 16-month-old FSUs sustained elevated levels of NFkappaB activity throughout the 10-day culture period. All irradiated groups showed significant loss of disc height, GAG content, mechanical function and changes in structure. Ablation of MyD88 blunted the radiation-mediated NFkappaB signaling, and preserved GAG content, and the IVDs' structure and mechanical performance. Conclusions: These results suggest that high-dose radiation affects the IVDs' NFkappaB-dependent inflammatory processes that subsequently lead to functional deterioration. Blocking the transactivation potential of NFkappaB via MyD88 ablation preserved the structure and mechanical function of the FSUs. The long-term effects of radiation on IVD homeostasis should be considered in individuals susceptible to occupational and medical exposure.",Included

Uneven distribution of the dosage is provided by using a grid diaphragm and conducting gamma-therapy only from one static field during the whole course of irradiation. This pattern of radiotherapy is shown to increase radioresistance of normal tissues and allows 1.5--4 times large focal dose to be applied to tumor compared with gamma-therapy via moving lead strips, thus rendering an enhanced antitumor effect of radiation.

The aim of this study was to determine if application of these QUANTEC criteria also protected against moderate-to-severe patient-rated xerostomia., MATERIAL AND METHODS: The study population consisted of 307 head and neck cancer patients treated with primary (chemo)radiotherapy, either with 3D-CRT (56%) or with IMRT (44%). All patients participated in a standard follow-up program in which radiation-induced toxicity and quality of life were prospectively assessed. Patients who met the QUANTEC criteria were classified as low risk and otherwise as high risk., RESULTS: In total, 41% of the patients (treated with 3D-CRT and IMRT) were classified as low risk patients. In the group treated with 3D-CRT and IMRT, it was possible to meet the QUANTEC criteria in 47% and 32% of the patients, respectively. Sparing the parotid glands with IMRT was considerably more difficult in patients with lymph node metastases and in patients with nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal tumours. Low risk patients reported significantly less moderate-to-severe xerostomia than high risk patients. However, the predicted risk of elderly patients and patients with pre-existing minor patient-rated xerostomia at baseline was > 20%, even when the QUANTEC criteria were met., CONCLUSIONS: Significantly lower rates of radiation-induced patient-rated xerostomia were found among low risk patients treated according to the QUANTEC criteria, but these criteria do not completely protect against xerostomia. Particularly in elderly patients and patients already suffering from minor xerostomia at baseline, the QUANTEC criteria do not sufficiently protect against persistent, moderate-to-severe patient-rated xerostomia.",Excluded
1287,"Thyroid radiation doses during radioimmunotherapy of CEA-expressing tumours with 131I-labelled monoclonal antibodies A number of radioimmunotherapy (RAIT) trials with iodinated antibodies have shown a high variability in the radiation doses to the thyroid. Therefore, the aim of this study was to evaluate which factors influence these thyroid doses during RAIT with 131iodinated monoclonal anti-carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) antibodies. Data from 36 patients with CEA-expressing tumours were analysed. The patients underwent RAIT with the 131I-labelled IgG1 anti-CEA antibody, MN-14 (Ka = 10(9) l mol-1) or its F(ab')2 fragment (activity range 45.8-220.0 mCi). The thyroid was blocked with 120 mg iodine (lugol's orSSKI solution) and 400 mg perchlorate per day, starting 1 day prior to the first study. Blood clearance and molecular composition of labelled plasma compounds were determined by blood sampling and size-exclusion high-performance liquid chromatography analysis. The cumulated activities of tissues were determined from daily imaging and blood clearance data. Doses were derived from the MIRD scheme. Thyroid radiation doses showed a high variability, between 1.2 and 37.7 cGy mCi-1 (mean +/- S.D.: 11.1 +/- 8.3 cGy mCi-1), corresponding to absolute doses between 2.5 and 43.6 Gy. However, the maximal iodine uptake in the thyroid was 2.4 +/- 1.9 microCi mCi-1 (range 0.2-10.0 microCi mCi-1), which was less than 1% of the injected activity, indicating that more than 99% of the thyroid was blocked in all cases. No correlation was found between these thyroid doses and conditions leading to an enhanced exposure to free radioiodine, such as unbound I- in the mAb preparation, rapid metabolic breakdown of the labelled antibody due to human anti-mouse antibodies (HAMA), or immune complex formation with circulating antigen. However, a relationship between the thyroid doses and the patients' compliance in taking their Lugol's and perchlorate blocking medications, as well as to a relatively high variability in the biological half-life of the iodine in the thyroid (range from 31.1 h to virtual infinity), is indicated. No rising TSH titres or other signs of (latent) hypothyroidism were seen in these patients during a 2 year follow-up period. Longer follow-up was not possible because of the terminal condition of most of the patients. These data show that thyroid doses in an appropriately blocked individual given a standard, non-myeloablative dose of RAIT, are generally lower than those assumed to be required to cause late hypothyroidism. Even if higher activities are used, potential hypothyroidism may be overcome easily by hormone replacement. Thyroid doses are independent of parameters leading to an enhanced exposure of the thyroid to free radioiodine, suggesting that patient compliance in taking their blocking medication may be the most crucial factor for reducing thyroid doses in RAIT with 131I-labelled antibodies.",Excluded
2394,"Use of Lung Cancer Screening With Low-Dose Computed Tomography in the Medicare Population Objective: To describe rates of low-dose computed tomography (LDCT) and all chest computerized tomography (CT) before and after Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) initiated reimbursement and requirements for screening and to describe factors associated with receipt of LDCT. Patients and Methods: Retrospective cross-sectional study of Medicare enrollees aged 55 to 77 in Parts A and B Medicare without HMO enrollment in a 20% national sample (n=3,887,430 in 2010, 4,200,875 in 2015, and 4,145,542 in 2016). The outcomes were receipt of LDCT and any chest CT from January 1, 2010, to December 31, 2016. Other measures included enrollee demographic characteristics and diagnoses, including diagnoses of tobacco use. Result(s): The number of enrollees aged 55 to 77 with LDCT rose throughout 2015 and early 2016, and then plateaued. In 2016, 0.44% of enrollees, and 2.21% of those with a tobacco-use diagnosis, underwent LDCT screening. There were increases in the rate of any chest CT (LDCT or diagnostic) between January 1, 2010 and December 31, 2016, and most of this was accounted for by LDCTs. Conclusion(s): Two years after CMS approval for lung cancer screening reimbursement, less than 5% of the Medicare population eligible for screening received LDCT. More work is required to identify and modify the barriers for LDCT screening.Copyright © 2018 Mayo Foundation for Medical Education and Research",Excluded

The nanoparticles were characterized by ultraviolet-visible spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction, field emission electron microscopic scanning mansoni (FESEM), and dynamic light scattering (DLS). For the in vitro test with Schistosoma mansoni, the DNHK-loaded PLGA was diluted into the medium, and added at concentrations 10-200 microM to the culture medium containing one adult worm pair. The parasites were kept for 120 h and monitored every 24 h to evaluate their general condition, including: pairing, alterations in motor activity and mortality., RESULTS: The loaded PLGA nanoparticles gave an encapsulation efficiency of 42.2% and showed spherical characteristics in monodisperse polymeric matrix. The adult worm pairs were separated after 120 h of incubation for concentrations higher than 50 microM of DNHK-loaded PLGA. The groups incubated with 150 and 200 microM of DNHK-loaded PLGA for 24 and 120 h killed 100% of adult worms, afforded LC50 values of 137.0 +/- 2.12 microM and 79.01 +/- 1.90 microM, respectively, which was similar to the effect displayed by 10 microM of praziquantel., DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS: The incorporation of DNHK-loaded showed schistosomicidal activity and allowed its sustained release. The loaded PLGA system can be administered intravenously, as well as it may be internalized by endocytosis by the target organisms.",Excluded
2049,"Geometrical changes of parotid, submandibular, and thyroid glands during intensity modulated radiation therapy for nasopharyngeal carcinoma Purpose/Objective(s): Both the tumor and organs at risk (OARs) occurred considerable changes during the intensity modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) course for nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC). This study aims to analyze quantitatively the geometrical variations of the parotid, submandibular gland (SMG) and thyroid as three independent OARs throughout IMRT course. Materials/Methods: Twenty NPC patients received the definitive chemo-IMRT in 33 fractions within 6.5 week-long course. Each patient had a planning CT (pCT) and six weekly repeat CT (rCT) without enhanced contrast. Each rCT was rigidly registered to its pCT. The parotid, SMG and thyroid were manually delineated in the axial pCT and rCT imaging by a single radiation oncologist. When compared a contour in pCT with rCT, it was calculated the volume of each contour (V-pCT, V-rCT), the common volume (V-com) and the shortest perpendicular distance (SPD) between two contours. Each surface voxel of a contour in rCT has a SPD and the standard deviation (SD) of all the SPDs was calculated. Both the SPD and Dice similarity coefficient (DSC) calculated as 2*V-com / (V-pCT + V-rCT) were used as the surrogate of the shape variations. The displacement of center of mass as the positional shift was calculated and the mean displacement, system and random error were statistically calculated. The difference of geometrical changes among six week, the left- and right- sided OAR was compared using one-way analysis of variance or Mann-Whitney U test. Result(s): The mean radiation dose of the parotid, SMG, thyroid gland were 32.12 >= 11.2 Gy, 25.46 >= 8.62 Gy, 18.89 >= 10.24 Gy, (mean >= standard deviation) respectively. And their mean and maximal volume reduction were 28.6% >= 14.6%, 26.6% >= 17.1%, 12.3% >= 11.3% and 40.6% >= 12.4%, 38.9%>=14.9%, 16.3%>=14.3%, respectively. For the parotid and SMG, the volume loss per treatment day decreased from 1.7%, 1.6% in the first week to 0.5%, 0.6% in the last week, and that of thyroid was of 0.4% - 0.5% after the 2nd week. The center of mass displacement of parotid gland shifted medially 2.0 mm - 2.6 mm, SMG and thyroid did medially 0.1 mm - 0.5 mm. In addition, the displacement in anterior-posterior and cranial-caudal direction were < 0.6 mm. The 3-demensional vector displacements of the parotid and SMG were 2.2mme 2.9mmand that of thyroid were 4.0mm- 4.3 mm. The DSCs of parotid, SMGand thyroid showed the decreased time-trend. For the parotid, SMG, thyroid, the SD of SPDs increased from 1.5 mm e 1.8 mm in the first week to 2.1mme2.5 mm. The variations among the different weeks were statistically different (P < 0.05) and there was no difference between the left- and right-sided OARs (P> 0.05). Conclusion(s): For NPC, the volume, position and shape of parotid, SMG, thyroid occurred in quantifiable variations and these geometrical changes have their time-trend, which suggests the necessity of re-planning for the further sparing of OAR further during IMRT.",Excluded

3592,"Histopathologic Analysis of Lung Cancer Incidence Associated with Radon Exposure among Ontario Uranium Miners Although radon is a well-established contributor to lung cancer mortality among uranium miners, the effects of radon decay products on different histopathologies of lung carcinoma are not well established. Using a retrospective cohort design, this study aims to examine the risks of lung cancer by histological subtypes associated with exposure to radon decay products among the Ontario Uranium Miners cohort. Cases were stratified by histological groups, and associated risks were estimated for cumulative radon exposure after adjustment for attained age and calendar period. Between 1969 and 2005, 1274 incident cases of primary lung cancer were identified. Of these, 1256 diagnoses (99%) contained information on histology. Squamous cell carcinoma was most common (31%), followed by adenocarcinoma (20%), large cells (18%), small cell lung carcinoma (14%), and other or unspecified cell types (17%). Of the histological sub-groups, small cell lung carcinoma had the strongest association with cumulative radon exposure; compared to the reference group (<1 cumulative working level months (WLM)), the highest exposure category (>60 cumulative WLM) had a relative risk (RR) of 2.76 (95% CI: 1.67-4.57). Adenocarcinoma had the lowest risk and was not significantly associated with exposure to radon decay products (RR = 1.49, 95% CI: 0.96-2.31). An increasing, linear trend in relative risk was noted with increasing cumulative WLM across small cell, squamous cell, and large cell lung carcinomas (Ptrend < 0.05). Similarly, the excess relative risk (ERR) per WLM was highest for small cell lung carcinoma (ERR/WLM = 0.15, p < 0.01), followed by squamous cell carcinoma (ERR/WLM = 0.12, p < 0.01). Non-statistically significant excess risk was observed for adenocarcinoma (ERR/WLM = 0.004, p = 0.07). Our analysis of the Ontario Uranium Miners cohort data shows differences in the magnitude of the risks across four histological subtypes of lung carcinoma; the strongest association was noted for small cell lung carcinoma, followed by squamous cell, large cell, and lastly adenocarcinoma, which showed no significant associations with exposure to radon decay products.",Included
3123,"A higher radiotherapy dose is associated with more durable palliation and longer survival in patients with metastatic melanoma BACKGROUND: Oncologists are often reluctant to recommend radiotherapy (RT) to palliate metastatic melanoma due to a perception that this tumor is ""radioresistant."" The Mayo Clinic experience was analyzed to determine the efficacy of palliative RT., METHODS: Eighty-four consecutive patients with 114 lesions that were not metastatic to the central nervous system (CNS) were evaluated for the response of the presenting symptom, the duration of response, and survival after RT. The median dose delivered was 30 grays (Gy) and the median biologic effective dose (BED) was 39.0 Gy(10). Performance status was not uniformly available for all patients., RESULTS: Complete resolution of the presenting symptom occurred in 10 lesions (9%). Of the lesions treated, there was partial improvement in 86 (75%), no change in 12 (11%), and worsening in 6 (5%) lesions. The median survival was 3.8 months and freedom from disease progression (FFP) for individual lesions was 6 months. Patients treated with >30 Gy had significantly longer FFP compared with patients given 30 Gy had a significantly longer survival than those given a lesser dose (median of 2 months vs 8 months; P < .0001). Similarly, patients receiving a BED >39.0 Gy(10) also were found to have longer FFP (P = .03) and survival (median of 2 months vs 8 months; P < .0001) compared with those receiving a BED 30 Gy and a BED >39.0 Gy(10) were found to be associated with longer palliation.",Excluded

Data on disease control and toxicity were collected as well as patient and treatment characteristics. Acute (<6 mo) and late (>=6 mo) severe toxicity (grade >=3) were graded. Four patients were excluded due to the presence of metastatic disease or stage TX. Late toxicity data were available for 120 patients., RESULTS: Median cumulative IMRT dose was 51.25 Gy (median, 28 fractions). All but 2 patients received chemotherapy. With median follow-up of 26.8 months, local control at 3 years was 87%, worse for patients with T3-T4 than T1-T2 disease on univariate analysis (79% vs. 90%; P=0.04). Regional control, distant control, and overall survival were 97%, 91%, and 87%, respectively, at 3 years. Nodal status was associated with regional control, distant control, and overall survival (P<0.01 for each). Most common severe acute toxicity was hematologic (41%), skin (20%), and gastrointestinal tract (11%). Two grade 5 toxicities occurred (hematologic and gastrointestinal tract). Severe late toxicity affected skin (1%) and gastrointestinal tract (3%)., CONCLUSIONS: IMRT with chemotherapy resulted in excellent local control. Although T stage predicted worse local control, most T3-T4 disease was controlled with IMRT. Nodal status predicted regional and distant control and overall survival.

159,"Subthalamic nucleus deep brain stimulation improves deglutition in Parkinson's disease Relatively little is known about the role of the basal ganglia in human deglutition. Deep brain stimulation (DBS) affords us a model for examining deglutition in humans with known impairment of the basal ganglia. The purpose of this study was to examine the effects of subthalamic nuclei (STN) DBS on the oral and pharyngeal stages of deglutition in individuals with Parkinson's Disease (PD). It was hypothesized that DBS would be associated with improved deglutition. Within participant, comparisons were made between DBS in the ON and OFF conditions using the dependent variables: pharyngeal transit time, maximal hyoid bone excursion, oral total composite score, and pharyngeal total composite score. Significant improvement occurred for the pharyngeal composite score and pharyngeal transit time in the DBS ON condition compared with DBS OFF. Stimulation of the STN may excite thalamocortical or brainstem targets to sufficiently overcome the bradykinesia/hypokinesia associated with PD and return some pharyngeal stage motor patterns to performance levels approximating those of normal"" deglutition. However, the degree of hyoid bone excursion and oral stage measures did not improve, suggesting that these motor acts may be under the control of different sensorimotor pathways within the basal ganglia.

Radionu-clide therapy efficacy may even be improved by using the alpha emitter Ac-225. Higher efficacy is claimed due to high linear energy transfer specifically towards PSMA positive cells, causing more double-strand breaks. This study aims to manufacture [225Ac]Ac-PSMA-I&T according to good manufacturing practice guidelines for the translation of [225Ac]Ac-PSMA-I&T into a clinical phase 1 dose escalation study. Quencher addition during labeling was investigated. Quality control of [225Ac]Ac-PSMA-I&T was based on measurement of Fr-221 (218 keV), in equilibrium with Ac-225 in approximately six half-lives of Fr-221 (T12 = 4.8 min). Radio-(i)TLC methods were utilized for identification of the different radiochemical forms, gamma counter for concentration determination, and HPGe-detector for the detection of the radiochemical yield. Radiochemical purity was determined by HPLC. The final patient dose was prepared and diluted with an optimized concentration of quenchers as during labeling, with an activity of 8-12 MBq (+/-5%), pH > 5.5, 100 +/- 20 microg/dose, PSMA-I&T, radiochemical yield >95%, radiochemical purity >90% (up to 3 h), endotoxin levels of <5 EU/mL, osmolarity of 2100 mOsmol, and is produced according to current guidelines.

This phase III trial was planned to determine whether in the same category of patients 8 Gy single-dose is as effective as 8 Gy x 2. Material(s) and Method(s): Three hundred and twenty-seven patients with MSCC and short life expectancy were randomly assigned to a short-course of 8 Gy x 2 or to 8 Gy single-dose RT. Median follow-up was 31 months (range, 4-58). Result(s): A total of 303 (93%) patients are assessable, 150 treated with the short-course and 153 with the single-dose RT. No difference in response was found between the two RT schedules adopted. Median duration of response was 5 and 4.5 months for short-course and single-dose RT (p = 0.4), respectively. The median overall survival was 4 months for all cases. Light acute toxicity was registered in a minority of cases. Late toxicity was never recorded. Conclusion(s): Both RT schedules adopted were effective. As already shown in several trials evaluating RT regimens in uncomplicated painful bone metastases, also MSCC patients may achieve palliation with minimal toxicity and inconvenience with a single-dose of 8 Gy. © 2009 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

Twenty cats underwent surgery to place a balloon for compression effect and 20 cats in a sham operation group received microsurgery without any treatment. The effects of gamma knife irradiation at 10-13 Gy on normal (sham operation group) and compressed (optic nerve compression group) optic nerves were investigated by pattern visual evoked potential examination and histopathology., RESULTS: Gamma knife radiosurgery at 10 Gy had almost no effect. At 11 Gy, P100 latency was significantly prolonged and P100 amplitude was significantly decreased in compressed optic nerves, but there was little change in the normal optic nerves. Doses of 11 Gy and higher induced significant electrophysiological variations and degeneration of the myelin sheath and axons in both normal and compressed optic nerves., CONCLUSIONS: Compressed optic nerves are more sensitive to gamma knife radiosurgery than normal optic nerves. The minimum dose of gamma knife radiosurgery that causes radiation injury in normal optic nerves is 12 Gy; however, the minimum dose is 11 Gy in compressed optic nerves. Copyright © 2013 S.

Method(s): Between 1980 and 1988 at Varese University Hospital, 60 consecutive patients with T2N0 glottic carcinoma received exclusive radiotherapy consisting of 1.5 Gy/fraction twice a day. Treatment gaps during the radiotherapy course were allowed according to individual tolerance. This policy resulted in a wide range of elapsed treatment time: median, 5.7 weeks; range, 3.7-8.9. Median follow-up is 9.8 years. Result(s): As a result of dose/time distribution, 16, 20 and 24 patients received an average weekly dose rate of <10 Gy/week, equal to 10 Gy/week or >10 Gy/week, respectively. Mean total dose for each group was 62.8 Gy, 63.7 Gy and 63.8 Gy, respectively. Five-year local-regional control was 69 +/- 6% (95% CI); ultimate local-regional control, including salvage surgery, was 78 +/- 5%. All failures were at the primary site, and no patient developed neck recurrence as first site of failure. The actuarial incidence of grade 2-3 late reactions at 5 years was 42 +/- 6%. Most late toxicity events were grade 2: only 2 patients developed grade 3 reactions and none grade 4. None of the several clinical and treatment-related variables showed any statistically significant impact on local-regional control or late toxicity at univariate and multivariate analysis. In particular, 3-year local-regional control rates were 73 +/- 11%, 84 +/- 8% and 69 +/- 10% for an average weekly dose rate of <10 Gy/week, equal to 10 Gy/week and >10 Gy/week, respectively (not significantly different). Conclusion(s): At a very long follow-up, the hyperfractionated regimen tested in the study was shown to be effective and devoid of major complications, provided individual patient acute tolerance is carefully taken into account.

Objectives/Purpose: Aim of this study was to retrospectively compare the image quality and the radiation dose of an ultra high pitch CT scan for the evaluation of pulmonary embolism and visualization of cardiac structures in comparison to our institution's standard pulmonary embolism protocol. Method and materials: The study cohort consisted of 115 consecutive patients, 57 underwent CT pulmonary angiography on a dual source 128 slice scanner (Siemens Somatom Definition FLASH) via an ultra high pitch mode (Pitch 2.8) while 58 were scanned on a dual source 64 slice scanner (Siemens Somatom Definition Dual Source) with standard pitch (Pitch 0.9). Qualitative image assessment was determined by two blinded radiologists with 3 and 15 years' experience in chest and cardiac CT. Quantitative image assessment was determined by the signal to noise ratio (SNR) and contrast to noise ratio (CNR). Effective radiation dose was calculated via the product of the dose length product. Result(s): For the ultra high pitch protocol, 14% (8/57) were positive for pulmonary embolus compared to 13.7% (8/58) for the standard pitch group. 98.2% of the ultra high pitch scans were diagnostic for pulmonary embolus vs. 94.8% of the standard protocol. Visualization of cardiac structures was significantly improved with the ultra high pitch protocol (p < 0.0001). Significantly more lung parenchymal motion was observed on the standard protocol (p < 0.0001). The mean pulmonary vessel attenuation, SNR, and CNR were not significantly different. The mean effective dose was lower for the ultra high pitch studies (4.09 mSv +/- 0.78 vs. 7.72 mSv +/- 2.60, p < 0.0001).

2796,"Economic Analysis of a Three-Arm RCT Exploring the Delivery of Intensive, Prophylactic Swallowing Therapy to Patients with Head and Neck Cancer During (Chemo)Radiotherapy Research advocates for the use of intensive, prophylactic swallowing therapy to help reduce the severity of dysphagia in patients receiving (chemo)radiotherapy ([C]RT) for head/neck cancer (HNC). Unfortunately, the intensity of this therapy, coupled with growing patient numbers and limited clinical resources, provides challenges to many international cancer facilities. Telepractice has been proposed as a potential method to provide patients with greater support in home-practice, whilst minimising burden to the health service. This study investigated the clinical and patient-attributable costs of delivering an intensive, prophylactic swallowing therapy protocol via a new telepractice application ""SwallowIT"" as compared to clinician-directed FTF therapy and independent patient self-directed therapy. Patients (n = 79) with oropharyngeal HNC receiving definitive (C)RT were randomised to receive therapy via a: clinician-directed (n = 26), patient-directed (n = 27), or SwallowIT-assisted (n = 26) model of care. Data pertaining to health service costs (service time, consumables, therapy resources), patient-attributable costs (travel and wages) and patient-reported health-related quality of life (QoL) (AQoL-6D) were collected. SwallowIT provided a cost-efficient model of care when compared to the clinician-directed model, with significant cost savings to both the health service and to HNC consumers (total saving of $1901.10 AUD per patient; p < 0.001). The SwallowIT model also proved more cost-effective than the patient-directed model, yielding clinically significantly superior QoL at the end of (C)RT, for comparable costs. Overall, when compared to the alternate methods of service-delivery, SwallowIT provided a financially viable and cost-effective method for the delivery of intensive, prophylactic swallowing therapy to patients with HNC during (C)RT.Copyright © 2018, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.",Excluded

534,"Post-remission treatment with allogeneic stem cell transplantation in patients aged 60 years and older with acute myeloid leukaemia: A time-dependent analysis Background: Acute myeloid leukaemia mainly affects elderly people, with a median age at diagnosis of around 70 years. Although about 50-60% of patients enter first complete remission upon intensive induction chemotherapy, relapse remains high and overall outcomes are disappointing. Therefore, effective post-remission therapy is urgently needed. Although often no post-remission therapy is given to elderly patients, it might include chemotherapy or allogeneic haemopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) following reduced-intensity conditioning. We aimed to assess the comparative value of allogeneic HSCT with other approaches, including no post-remission therapy, in patients with acute myeloid leukaemia aged 60 years and older. Method(s): For this time-dependent analysis, we used the results from four successive prospective HOVON-SAKK acute myeloid leukaemia trials. Between May 3, 2001, and Feb 5, 2010, a total of 1155 patients aged 60 years and older were entered into these trials, of whom 640 obtained a first complete remission after induction chemotherapy and were included in the analysis. Post-remission therapy consisted of allogeneic HSCT following reduced-intensity conditioning (n=97), gemtuzumab ozogamicin (n=110), chemotherapy (n=44), autologous HSCT (n=23), or no further treatment (n=366). Reduced-intensity conditioning regimens consisted of fludarabine combined with 2 Gy of total body irradiation (n=71), fludarabine with busulfan (n=10), or other regimens (n=16). A time-dependent analysis was done, in which allogeneic HSCT was compared with other types of post-remission therapy. The primary endpoint of the study was 5-year overall survival for all treatment groups, analysed by a time-dependent analysis. Finding(s): 5-year overall survival was 35% (95% CI 25-44) for patients who received an allogeneic HSCT, 21% (17-26) for those who received no additional post-remission therapy, and 26% (19-33) for patients who received either additional chemotherapy or autologous HSCT. Overall survival at 5 years was strongly affected by the European LeukemiaNET acute myeloid leukaemia risk score, with patients in the favourable risk group (n=65) having better 5-year overall survival (56% [95% CI 43-67]) than those with intermediate-risk (n=131; 23% [19-27]) or adverse-risk (n=444; 13% [8-20]) acute myeloid leukaemia. Multivariable analysis with allogeneic HSCT as a time-dependent variable showed that allogeneic HSCT was associated with better 5-year overall survival (HR 0.71 [95% CI 0.53-0.95], p=0.017) compared with non-allogeneic HSCT post-remission therapies or no post-remission therapy, especially in patients with intermediate-risk (0.82 [0.58-1.15]) or adverse-risk (0.39 [0.21-0.73]) acute myeloid leukaemia. Interpretation(s): Collectively, the results from these four trials suggest that allogeneic HSCT might be the preferred treatment approach in patients 60 years of age and older with intermediate-risk and adverse-risk acute myeloid leukaemia in first complete remission, but the comparative value should ideally be shown in a prospective randomised study.

2724,"Overexpression of AIB1 predicts resistance to chemoradiotherapy and poor prognosis in patients with primary esophageal squamous cell carcinoma AIB1 (amplified in breast cancer 1) is frequently overexpressed in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC), but the significance of AIB1 expression in chemoradiotherapy (CRT) sensitivity and its effect on prognosis are still unclear. In this study, the expression of AIB1 was examined by immunohistochemistry in 98 biopsy specimens of primary ESCC patients treated with definitive CRT. AIB1 overexpression was found in 63/98 (64.3%) of the ESCCs. There was a significant association between AIB1 overexpression and distant lymph node metastases (P = 0.011), but not regional lymph node metastases. In the M0 subgroup, overexpression of AIB1 was observed more frequently in stage T4 than in stage T2-3 (66.7%vs 38.5%, P = 0.031). In addition, AIB1 expression was the only factor that showed a significant correlation with CRT response, in which overexpression of AIB1 was observed more frequently in the CRT resistant group than in the CRT effective group (86.5%vs 50.8%, P < 0.001). Univariate analysis revealed that AIB1 overexpression was associated with poor progression-free survival (PFS) (P < 0.001) and poor disease-specific survival (DSS) (P <0.001). Furthermore, AIB1 expression could stratify patient survival in stages T2-3, T4, N1, and M0 (P < 0.05), as well as in the CRT effective group (P < 0.05), and AIB1 overexpression and CRT resistance were evaluated as significant independent prognostic factors for both PFS and DSS in multivariate analysis.

This is usually obtained by interventional radiology (IR), although it is not routinely performed. Recently, we developed a simple novel technique for EUS-guided PPG measurement (PPGM). Our animal studies showed excellent correlation between EUS-PPGM and IR-PPGM. We present the first human pilot study of EUS-PPGM in patients with liver disease. Methods EUS-PPGM was performed by experienced endosonographers using a linear echoendoscope, a 25-gauge fine-needle aspiration needle, and a novel compact manometer. The portal vein and hepatic vein (or inferior vena cava) were targeted using a transgastric-transduodenal approach. Clinical parameters of PH were evaluated in each patient. Feasibility was defined as successful PPGM in each patient. Safety was based on adverse events captured in a postprocedural interview. Results Twenty-eight patients underwent EUS-PPGM with 100% technical success and no adverse events. PPG ranged from 1.5 to 19 mm Hg and had excellent correlation with clinical parameters of portal hypertension including the presence of varices (P = .0002), PH gastropathy (P = .007), and thrombocytopenia (P = .036). PPG was increased in patients with high clinical evidence of cirrhosis (P = .005). Conclusion This novel technique of EUS-PPGM using a 25-gauge needle and compact manometer is feasible and appears safe. Given the availability of EUS and the simplicity of the manometry setup, EUS-guided PPG may represent a promising breakthrough for procuring indispensable information in the management of patients with liver disease.Copyright © 2017",Excluded
3531,"Dose-volumetric parameters predicting radiation-induced hepatic toxicity in unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma patients treated with three-dimensional conformal radiotherapy PURPOSE: To identify the dose-volumetric parameters associated with the risk of radiation-induced hepatic toxicity (RIHT) in hepatocellular carcinoma patients treated with three-dimensional conformal radiotherapy., METHODS AND MATERIALS: A total of 105 hepatocellular carcinoma patients underwent three-dimensional conformal radiotherapy (total dose range, 44-58.5 Gy; median, 54). RIHT was scored within 4 months of completing three-dimensional conformal radiotherapy. The dose-volume parameters analyzed were the gross tumor volume; normal liver volume; total liver volume; radiation dose; mean dose to the normal liver; percentage of the normal liver volume receiving > or =20, > or =25, > or =30, > or =35, and > or =40 Gy; percentage of the total liver volume receiving > or =20, > or =25, > or =30, > or =35, and > or =40 Gy; and the normal tissue complication probability., RESULTS: Of the 105 patients, Grade 1 RIHT was observed in 21 (20.0%), Grade 2 in 7 (6.7%), Grade 3 in 5 (4.8%), and Grade 4 in 1 (1.0%) patient. No fatal Grade 5 RIHT developed. On multivariate analysis for predicting Grade 2 or worse RIHT, the total liver volume receiving > or =30 Gy was the only significant parameter (p < 0.001). Grade 2 or worse RIHT was observed in only 2 (2.4%) of 85 patients with a total liver volume receiving 30 Gy of 60% (p < 0.001)., CONCLUSION: The total liver volume receiving > or =30 Gy appears to be a useful dose-volumetric parameter for predicting the risk of RIHT. This volume should be limited to < or =60% whenever possible to minimize the risk of Grade 2 or worse RIHT.",Excluded

1722,"Vitamin D improves sunburns by increasing autophagy in M2 macrophages Cutaneous inflammation from UV radiation exposure causes epidermal damage, cellular infiltration, and secretion of pro-inflammatory mediators that exacerbate tissue destruction. Recovery is mediated chiefly by anti-inflammatory M2 macrophages that suppress inflammation and augment epidermal regeneration. Vitamin D enables anti-inflammation to promote tissue repair in response to injury. Since vitamin D enhances cellular macroautophagy/autophagy, we investigated the role of autophagy in vitamin D protection of UV-mediated sunburn and inflammation. Using a UV-mediated acute skin injury mouse model, we demonstrate that a single dose of vitamin D resolves injury with sustained inhibition of inflammatory cytokines associated with enhanced autophagy in myeloid anti-inflammatory M2 macs. Increased MAP1LC3B/LC3 expression corroborated with complete autolysosome formation detected by electron microscopy and correlated with degradation of SQSTM1/p62 in the skin following vitamin D treatment. Specifically, pharmacological inhibition of autophagy increased UV-induced apoptosis, suppressed M2 macs recruitment, and prevented vitamin D downregulation of Tnf and Mmp9 in the skin. Furthermore, selective deletion of autophagy in myeloid cells of atg7 cKO mice abrogated vitamin D-mediated protection and recapitulated UV-induced inflammation. Mechanistically, vitamin D signaling activated M2-autophagy regulators Klf4, Pparg, and Arg1. Lastly, analysis of UV-exposed human skin biopsies detected a similar increase in macrophage autophagy following vitamin D intervention, identifying an essential role for autophagy in vitamin D-mediated protection of skin from UV damage.

2091,"Gamma band oscillations reveal neural network cortical coherence dysfunction in schizophrenia patients BACKGROUND: Gamma band activity has been associated with many sensory and cognitive functions, and is important for cortico-cortical transmission and the integration of information across neural networks. The aims of the present study were to determine if schizophrenia patients have deficits in the generation and maintenance of coherent, synchronized oscillations in response to steady-state stimulation, and to examine the clinical and cognitive correlates of the electroencephalography (EEG) oscillatory dynamics., METHODS: Schizophrenia patients (n = 100) and nonpsychiatric subjects (n = 80) underwent auditory steady-state event-related potential testing. Click trains varying in rate of stimulation (20, 30, and 40 Hz) were presented; EEG-evoked power and intertrial phase synchronization were obtained in response to each stimulation frequency. Subjects also underwent clinical and neurocognitive assessments., RESULTS: Patients had reductions in both evoked power and phase synchronization in response to 30- and 40-Hz stimulation but normal responsivity to 20-Hz stimulation. Maximal deficits were detected in response to 40-Hz stimulation. A modest association of reduced working memory performance and 40-Hz intertrial phase synchronization was present in schizophrenia patients (r = .32, p <.01)., CONCLUSIONS: Schizophrenia patients have frequency-specific deficits in the generation and maintenance of coherent gamma-range oscillations, reflecting a fundamental degradation of basic integrated neural network activity.",Excluded
2259,"FANCD2 depletion sensitizes cancer cells repopulation ability in vitro Inactivation of Fanconi anemia/BRCA pathway in some cancers causes increased sensitivity to various drugs used for chemo-therapy. Several approaches have been suggested to artificially disrupt this pathway for better treatment. In our study, we have utilized RNA interference technique to knock-down the expression of FANCD2 and sensitize cancer cells undergoing treatment with DNA damaging agents. For this purpose, we transiently depleted FANCD2 by siRNA in a number of breast, bladder, or liver cancer cell lines and screened for mitomycin C or gamma-irradiation sensitivity changes. We could show that knocking-down FANCD2 gene expression increases sensitivity of cancer cells to mitomycin C and to less extent to gamma-rays. Importantly, this effect strongly correlates to repopulation ability of cancer cells and those cell lines with significant FANCD2 depletion revealed decreased recurrence capacity. In summary, the results we presented show proof of principle that opens new possibilities for further preclinical trials.",Excluded

633,"Case-control study of lung cancer risk from residential radon exposure in Worcester county, Massachusetts A study of lung cancer risk from residential radon exposure and its radioactive progeny was performed with 200 cases (58% male, 42% female) and 397 controls matched on age and sex, all from the same health maintenance organization. Emphasis was placed on accurate and extensive year-long dosimetry with etch-track detectors in conjunction with careful questioning about historic patterns of in-home mobility. Conditional logistic regression was used to model the outcome of cancer on radon exposure, while controlling for years of residency, smoking, education, income, and years of job exposure to known or potential carcinogens. Smoking was accounted for by nine categories: never smokers, four categories of current smokers, and four categories of former smokers. Radon exposure was divided into six categories (model 1) with break points at 25, 50, 75, 150, and 250 Bq m, the lowest being the reference. Surprisingly, the adjusted odds ratios (AORs) were, in order, 1.00, 0.53, 0.31, 0.47, 0.22, and 2.50 with the third category significantly below 1.0 (p < 0.05), and the second, fourth, and fifth categories approaching statistical significance (p < 0.1). An alternate analysis (model 2) using natural cubic splines allowed calculating AORs as a continuous function of radon exposure. That analysis produces AORs that are substantially less than 1.0 with borderline statistical significance (0.048 < or = p < or = 0.05) between approximately 85 and 123 Bq m. College-educated subjects in comparison to high-school dropouts have a significant reduction in cancer risk after controlling for smoking, years of residency, and job exposures with AOR = 0.30 (95% CI: 0.13, 0.69), p = 0.005 (model 1).",Included
1005,"Primary tumor site as a predictor of treatment outcome for definitive radiotherapy of advanced-stage oral cavity cancers Purpose: To evaluate the outcome of definitive radiotherapy (RT) for oral cavity cancers and to assess prognostic factors. Methods and Materials: Definitive RT was performed on 115 patients with oral cavity cancers at Stages III, IVA, and IVB, with a distribution of 6%, 47%, and 47%, respectively. The median dose of RT was 72Gy (range, 62-76Gy). Cisplatin-based chemotherapy was administered to 95% of the patients. Eleven patients underwent salvage surgery after RT failure. Result(s): Eight-eight (76.5%) patients responded partially and 23 (20%) completely; of the patients who responded, 18% and 57%, respectively, experienced a durable effect of treatment. The 3-year overall survival, disease-specific survival, and progression-free survival were 22%, 27%, and 25%, respectively. The 3-year PFS rates based on the primary tumor sites were as follows: Group I (buccal, mouth floor, and gum) 51%, Group II (retromolar and hard palate) 18%, and Group III (tongue and lip) 6% (p < 0.0001). The 3-year progression-free survival was 41% for N0 patients and 19% for patients with N+ disease (p = 0.012). The T stage and RT technique did not affect survival. The patients who underwent salvage surgery demonstrated better 3-year overall survival and disease-specific survival (53% vs. 19%, p = 0.015 and 53% vs. 24%, p = 0.029, respectively). Subsite group, N+, and salvage surgery were the only significant prognostic factors for survival after multivariate analysis. Conclusion(s): The primary tumor site and neck stage are prognostic predictors in advanced-stage oral cancer patients who received radical RT.

1329,"Set-up of an infrared fast behavioral assay using zebrafish (Danio rerio) larvae, and its application in compound biotoxicity screening Zebrafish (Danio rerio) is increasingly employed for evaluating toxicity and drug discovery assays. Commonly experimental approaches for biotoxicity assessment are based on visual inspection or video recording. However, these techniques are limited for large-scale assays, as they demand either a time-consuming detailed inspection of the animals or intensive computing resources in order to analyze a considerable amount of screenshots. Recently, we have developed a simple methodology for tracking the locomotor activity of small animals cultured in microtiter plates. In this work, we implemented this automatic methodology, based on infrared (IR) microbeam scattering, for measuring behavioral activity in zebrafish larvae. We determined the appropriate culture conditions, number of animals and stage of development to get robust results. Furthermore, we validated this methodology as a rapid test for evaluating toxicity. By measuring the effects of reference compounds on larvae activity, we were able to estimate the concentration that could cause a 50% decrease in activity events values (AEC50), showing a strong linear correlation (R2 = 0.91) with the LC50 values obtained with the standard DarT test. The toxicity order of the measured compounds was CuSO4 > 2,4-dinitrophenol > 3,4-dichloroaniline > SDS > sodium benzoate > EDTA > K2CrO4 ; regarding solvents, EtOH = DMSO. In this study, we demonstrate that global swimming behavior could be a simple readout for toxicity, easy to scale-up in automated experiments. This approach is potentially applicable for fast ecotoxicity assays and whole-organism high-throughput compound screening, reducing the time and money required to evaluate unknown samples and to identify leading pharmaceutical compounds.

Method(s):Forty-six patients were recruited and treated on the basis that MRI scanning had shown poor-risk tumours with threatening (1 mm) or involvement of the mesorectal fascia. Conformal RT was given using 3 or 4 fields at daily fractions of 1.8 Gy on 5 days per week to a total dose of 45 Gy. Concurrently oral capecitabine was given twice daily throughout radiotherapy continuously from days 1 to 35 and intravenous irinotecan was given once per week during weeks 1 to 4 of RT. Dose levels were gradually escalated as follows. Dose level 1: capecitabine 650 mg m 2 b.i.d. and irinotecan 50 mg m 2; Dose level 2: capecitabine 650 mg m 2 b.i.d. and irinotecan 60 mg m 2; Dose level 3: capecitabine 825 mg m 2 b.i.d. and irinotecan 60 mg m 2; Dose level 4: capecitabine 825 mg m 2 b.i.d. and irinotecan 70 mg m 2. Result(s):Diarrhoea (grade 3, no grade 4) was the main serious acute toxicity with lesser degrees of fatigue, neutropenia, anorexia and palmar-plantar erythrodysesthesia. The recommended dose for future study was dose level 2 at which 3 of 14 patients (21%) developed grade 3 diarrhoea. Postoperative complications included seven pelvic or wound infections and two anastomotic and two perineal wound dehiscences. There were no deaths in the first 30 days postoperatively. Of 41 resected specimens, 11 (27%) showed a pathological complete response (pCR) and five (12%) showed an involved circumferential resection margin (defined as 1 mm). The 3-year disease-free survival (intent-to-treat) was 53.2%. Conclusion(s):In patients with poor-risk MRI-defined locally advanced rectal cancer threatening or involving the mesorectal fascia, preoperative chemoradiation based on RT at 45 Gy in 25 daily fractions over 5 weeks with continuous daily oral capecitabine at 650 mg m 2 b.i.d. days 1-35 and weekly IV irinotecan at 60 mg m 2 weeks 1-4, provides acceptable acute toxicity and postoperative morbidity with encouraging response and curative resection rates. © 2009 Cancer Research UK.",Excluded

Donor lymphocytes were stimulated with irradiated expanded recipient T lymphocytes in an ex vivo mixed lymphocyte reaction. Alloactivated T cells preferentially retaining the photosensitizer 4,5-dibromorhodamine 123 (TH9402) were eliminated by exposure to visible light. Twenty-four patients with hematologic malignancies (16 high risk) conditioned with fludarabine, cyclophosphamide, and totalbody irradiation received a CD34-selected stem cell allograft from an HLA-matched sibling along with 5 x 106/kg selectively depleted donor T cells. Low-dose cyclosporine was used for posttransplantation immunosuppression. Eleven patients survived at a median of 30 months.

1308,"Subacute haematotoxicity after PRRT with (177)Lu-DOTA-octreotate: prognostic factors, incidence and course PURPOSE: In peptide receptor radionuclide therapy (PRRT), the bone marrow (BM) is one of the dose-limiting organs. The accepted dose limit for BM is 2 Gy, adopted from (131)I treatment. We investigated the incidence and duration of haematological toxicity and its risk factors in patients treated with PRRT with (177)Lu-DOTA(0)-Tyr(3)-octreotate ((177)Lu-DOTATATE). Also, absorbed BM dose estimates were evaluated and compared with the accepted 2 Gy dose limit., METHODS: The incidence and duration of grade 3 or 4 haematological toxicity (according to CTCAE v3.0) and risk factors were analysed. Mean BM dose per unit (gigabecquerels) of administered radioactivity was calculated and the correlations between doses to the BM and haematological risk factors were determined., RESULTS: Haematological toxicity (grade 3/4) occurred in 34 (11 %) of 320 patients. In 15 of the 34 patients, this lasted more than 6 months or blood transfusions were required. Risk factors significantly associated with haematological toxicity were: poor renal function, white blood cell (WBC) count <4.0 x 10(9)/l, age over 70 years, extensive tumour mass and high tumour uptake on the OctreoScan. Previous chemotherapy was not associated. The mean BM dose per administered activity in 23 evaluable patients was 67 +/- 7 mGy/GBq, resulting in a mean BM dose of 2 Gy in patients who received four cycles of 7.4 GBq (177)Lu-DOTATATE. Significant correlations between (cumulative) BM dose and platelet and WBC counts were found in a selected group of patients., CONCLUSION: The incidence of subacute haematological toxicity after PRRT with (177)Lu-DOTATATE is acceptable (11 %). Patients with impaired renal function, low WBC count, extensive tumour mass, high tumour uptake on the OctreoScan and/or advanced age are more likely to develop grade 3/4 haematological toxicity. The BM dose limit of 2 Gy, adopted from (131)I, seems not to be valid for PRRT with (177)Lu-DOTATATE.",Excluded
3666,"A tumor growth inhibition model for low-grade glioma treated with chemotherapy or radiotherapy Purpose: To develop a tumor growth inhibition model for adult diffuse low-grade gliomas (LGG) able to describe tumor size evolution in patients treated with chemotherapy or radiotherapy. Experimental Design: Using longitudinal mean tumor diameter (MTD) data from 21 patients treated with first-line procarbazine, 1-(2-chloroethyl)-3-cyclohexyl-l-nitrosourea, and vincristine (PCV) chemotherapy, we formulated a model consisting of a system of differential equations, incorporating tumorspecific and treatment-related parameters that reflect the response of proliferative and quiescent tumor tissue to treatment. The model was then applied to the analysis of longitudinal tumor size data in 24 patients treated with first-line temozolomide (TMZ) chemotherapy and in 25 patients treated with first-line radiotherapy. Result(s): The model successfully described the MTD dynamics of LGG before, during, and after PCV chemotherapy. Using the same model structure, we were also able to successfully describe the MTD dynamics inLGGpatients treated withTMZchemotherapy or radiotherapy. Tumor-specific parameters were found to be consistent across the three treatment modalities. The model is robust to sensitivity analysis, and preliminary results suggest that it can predict treatment response on the basis of pretreatment tumor size data. Conclusion(s): UsingMTDdata, we propose a tumor growth inhibition model able to describeLGGtumor size evolution in patients treated with chemotherapy or radiotherapy. In the future, this model might be used to predict treatment efficacy in LGG patients and could constitute a rational tool to conceive more effective chemotherapy schedules. ©2012 AACR.",Excluded

Our aim was to describe both sun exposure and sun protection behaviour in a series of patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), and to study their potential association with vitaminD concentration., PATIENTS AND METHODS: A cross sectional, observational study. The clinical-demographic variables were obtained via clinical interviews and medical history review. The sunlight exposure assessment was carried out using the Sun Exposure Questionnaire and the concentration of 25-hydroxy vitaminD (25OHD) was measured by an electro-chemiluminescence immunoassay. Questionnaires were conducted on quality of life, physical activity, weekly vitaminD intake and sun protection behaviour., RESULTS: 149 patients were included. In 69% of patients, deficient or insufficient 25OHD values were recorded. 67% showed low sun exposure. A modest significant correlation was observed between the total score of the solar exposure questionnaire and the 25OHD concentration in the complete series (r=0.226, P=.006) and in the summer (r=0.274, P=.01). The sun protection behaviour questionnaire score did not influence the 25OHD concentration. In the multivariate analysis, only the presence of clinical activity was associated with low sun exposure (OR=3.23)., DISCUSSION: Sun exposure according to the questionnaire used was low, was associated with the presence of clinical activity and was weakly correlated with serum 25OHD concentration. More studies are needed to explore the use of individual questionnaires for sun exposure and its relationship with vitaminD in patients with IBD. Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Espana, S.L.U.

Our purpose was to determine whether the dose to the brachial plexus (BP) can be constrained, without compromising regional control., METHODS: The radiation plans of 324 patients with oropharyngeal carcinoma (OPC) treated with intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) were reviewed. We identified 42 patients (13%) with gross nodal disease <1 cm from the BP. Normal tissue constraints included a maximum dose of 66 Gy and a D05 of 60 Gy for the BP. These criteria took precedence over planning target volume (PTV) coverage of nodal disease near the BP., RESULTS: There was only one regional failure in the vicinity of the BP, salvaged with neck dissection (ND) and regional re-irradiation. There have been no reported episodes of brachial plexopathy to date., CONCLUSIONS: In combined-modality therapy, including ND as salvage, regional control did not appear to be compromised by constraining the dose to the BP. This approach may improve the therapeutic ratio by reducing the long-term risk of brachial plexopathy.",Excluded
2268,"Celecoxib and radioresistant glioblastoma-derived CD133+ cells: Improvement in radiotherapeutic effects. Laboratory investigation Object. Glioblastoma, the most common primary brain tumor, has a poor prognosis, even with aggressive resection and chemoradiotherapy. Recent studies indicate that CD133+ cells play a key role in radioresistance and recurrence of glioblastoma. Cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), which converts arachidonic acid to prostaglandins, is overexpressed in a variety of tumors, including CD133+ glioblastomas. The COX-2-derived prostaglandins promote neovascularization during tumor development, and conventional radiotherapy increases the proportion of CD133+ cells rather than eradicating them. The aim of the present study was to investigate the role of celecoxib, a selective COX-2 inhibitor, in enhancing the therapeutic effects of radiation on CD133+ glioblastomas. Methods. Cells positive for CD133 were isolated from glioblastoma specimens and characterized by flow cytometry, then treated with celecoxib and/or ionizing radiation (IR). Clonogenic assay, cell irradiation, cell cycle analysis, Western blot, and xenotransplantation were used to assess the effects of celecoxib alone, IR alone, and IR with celecoxib on CD133+ and CD133- glioblastoma cells. Three separate xenotransplantation experiments were carried out using 310 severe combined immunodeficient (SCID) mice: 1) an initial tumorigenicity evaluation in which 3 different quantities of untreated CD133- cells or untreated or pretreated CD133+ cells (5 treatment conditions) from 7 different tumors were injected into the striatum of 2 mice (210 mice total); 2) a tumor growth study (50 mice); and 3) a survival study (50 mice). For these last 2 studies the same 5 categories of cells were used as in the tumorigenicity (untreated CD133 - cells, untreated or pretreated CD133+ cells, with pretreatment consisting of celecoxib alone, IR alone, or IR and celecoxib), but only 1 cell source (Case 2) and quantity (5 x 104 cells) were used. Results. High levels of COX-2 protein were detected in the CD133 + but not the CD133- glioblastoma cells. The authors further demonstrated that 30 mM celecoxib was able to effectively enhance the IR effect in inhibiting colony formation and increasing IR-mediated apoptosis in celecoxib-treated CD133+ glioblastoma cells. Furthermore, reduction in radioresistance was correlated with the induction of G2/M arrest, which was partially mediated through the increase in the level of phosphorylated-cdc2. In vivo xenotransplant analysis further confirmed that CD133+-associated tumorigenicity was significantly suppressed by celecoxib treatment. Importantly, pretreatment of CD133+ glioblastoma cells with a combination of celecoxib and IR before injection into the striatum of SCID mice resulted in a statistically significant reduction in tumor growth and a statistically significant increase in the mean survival rate of the mice. Conclusions. Celecoxib combined with radiation plays a critical role in the suppression of growth of CD133+ glioblastoma stemlike cells. Celecoxib is therefore a radiosensitizing drug for clinical application in glioblastoma.",Excluded

Additionally, cell proliferation, cell cycle and cell apoptosis were all analyzed in irradiated or sham-irradiated cells., RESULTS: Among the five antisense compounds (AS), AS3 was identified to efficiently inhibit p53 mRNA level and protein content. Interestingly, AS3 transfer has little effect on cell proliferation in DU-145 cells (mutant p53) after ionizing radiation (IR). In contrast, a marked increase of cell apoptosis and growth inhibition were observed in MCF-7 cells (wild-type p53), suggesting that AS3 can increase radiosensitivity of MCF-7 cells. Additionally, it was also observed that the transfection of AS3 decreased the fraction of G1 phase cells, and increased the proportion of S phase cells compared to untreated cells 24 h after IR in MCF-7 cell lines., CONCLUSION: AS3 transfection increases MCF-7 cell apoptosis induced by 5 Gy-radiation, and this mechanism may be closely associated with abrogation of G1 phase arrest.",Included
2412,"Outcomes of Trimodal Therapy for cT2-3 Urothelial Carcinoma in a Racially Diverse Population: A Single Institution Experience in the Bronx BACKGROUND: Radical cystectomy (RC) is the historical 'gold standard' treatment for cT2-3 urothelial carcinoma (UC). However, recent evidence supports comparable outcomes of bladder preserving trimodal therapy (TMT) to RC in select patients. OBJECTIVE(S): To assess the oncologic outcomes of our institutional TMT experience. METHOD(S): We retrospectively identified all patients that received radiation therapy (RT) for cT2-3 UC from 2012 to 2018. Clinicopathologic data was then extracted from the patients' medical records. We included patients who underwent RT with or without concurrent chemotherapy for curative intent after diagnostic TURBT, with or without re-staging TURBT. Patient clinical (age, sex, race) and pathologic/disease characteristics of bladder cancer (stage, presence of hydronephrosis, concurrent carcinoma in-situ) were collected. Primary outcomes were: response to TMT (complete response [CR], partial response [PR], progression), recurrence-free, and overall survival. We also analyzed rates of salvage cystectomy and associated disease-specific outcomes. Response was based on the first surveillance imaging, cystoscopy, or TURBT after completion of TMT. RESULT(S): 24 patients underwent TMT during the study period. 29.2% of patients were black/non-hispanic, 37.5% were latino/hispanic, and 20.8% were white/non-hispanic. 58.3% of patients were female. 19 (79.2%), 3 (12.5%), and 2 (8.3%) patients experienced CR, PR and progression after TMT, respectively. At a median follow-up of 22.4 months, 19 (79.2%) patients were recurrence-free, 3 were alive with disease (12.5%), and 2 expired from other causes (8.3%; 1 with and 1 without disease present). Overall, 22 (92.7%) patients were still alive at last follow-up. No clinical variables were significant predictors of CR to TMT. CONCLUSION(S): In concordance with prior reports, TMT offers excellent tumor response rates for patients seeking definitive therapy for cT2-3 UC. Extended follow-up is needed to assess the durability of response and long-term survival after TMT.Copyright © 2020 - IOS Press and the authors. All rights reserved.",Excluded
2736,"Feasibility and potential utility of multicomponent exhaled breath analysis for predicting development of radiation pneumonitis after stereotactic ablative radiotherapy INTRODUCTION: In this prospective pilot study, we evaluated the feasibility and potential utility of measuring multiple exhaled gases as biomarkers of radiation pneumonitis (RP) in patients receiving stereotactic ablative radiotherapy (SABR) for lung tumors., METHODS: Breath analysis was performed for 26 patients receiving SABR for lung tumors. Concentrations of exhaled nitric oxide (eNO), carbon monoxide (eCO), nitrous oxide (eN2O), and carbon dioxide (eCO2) were measured before and immediately after each fraction using real-time, infrared laser spectroscopy. RP development (CTCAE grade >=2) was correlated with baseline gas concentrations, acute changes in gas concentrations after each SABR fraction, and dosimetric parameters., RESULTS: Exhaled breath analysis was successfully completed in 77% of patients. Five of 20 evaluable patients developed RP at a mean of 5.4 months after SABR. Acute changes in eNO and eCO concentrations, defined as percent changes between each pre-fraction and post-fraction measurement, were significantly smaller in RP versus non-RP cases (p = 0.022 and 0.015, respectively). In an exploratory analysis, a combined predictor of baseline eNO greater than 24 parts per billion and acute decrease in eCO less than 5.5% strongly correlated with RP incidence (p =0.0099). Neither eN2O nor eCO2 concentrations were significantly associated with RP development. Although generally higher in patients destined to develop RP, dosimetric parameters were not significantly associated with RP development., CONCLUSIONS: The majority of SABR patients in this pilot study were able to complete exhaled breath analysis. Baseline concentrations and acute changes in concentrations of exhaled breath components were associated with RP development after SABR. If our findings are validated, exhaled breath analysis may become a useful approach for noninvasive identification of patients at highest risk for developing RP after SABR.",Excluded

The study cohort was composed of 11,367 adults living within a five km radius from the NPPs for the exposed and 24,809 adults for the non-exposed or reference cohort set at two different levels of proximity; 5-30 km radius and more than 30 km radius away from NPPs. In 303,542.5 person-years of follow-up, a total of 2,298 cancer cases of all sites, or 1,377 radio-inducible cancers diagnosed during 1992-2008 were ascertained. Multiple adjusted hazard ratios and 95% confidence intervals were estimated using multivariate Cox proportional hazard model. There were no epidemiological evidence for increased risk of cancer due to radiation from NPPs. Radiological study results or surveillance data of radiation doses around NPPs could be well documented for risk estimation of radio-inducible cancers, instead of epidemiological study results of the long-time required. Continuous surveillance of quantitative measures of dose levels around NPPs and radiation exposures to the residents is warranted.",Included
1830,"The possible benefit from total tumour resection in primary diffuse large B-cell lymphoma of central nervous system-a one-decade single-centre experience Background and methods. The aim of the study was to evaluate retrospectively clinical course of 27 patients with primary central nervous system lymphoma (PCNSL) diagnosed and treated by different surgical approaches. Initial therapy-diagnostic approach included surgery with total tumour reduction (TTR) performed in 12 patients (44.4%), while partial reduction and biopsy were performed in 8 (29.7%) and 7 (25.9%) patients, respectively. All patients were treated with chemotherapy based on high-dose methotrexate (HD-MTX) with/without whole-brain radiotherapy (WBRT). Results. The median overall survival (OS) and event-free survival were 37 and 31 months, respectively, with overall response rate of 74%. The patients who underwent an open surgery with TTR had significantly longer OS (median not reached), comparing with partial tumour reduction or biopsy only (Log-Rank chi2 6.08, p = 0.014) when median OS was 23 months. In patients with performance status according to Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG PS) >= 3, OS was 23 months, contrary to ECOG PS 1-2 when median was not reached. The International Extranodal Lymphoma Study Group score (low, intermediate and high) also influenced OS between three risk groups (Log-Rank chi2 12.5, p = 0.002). Conclusion. The treatment of PCNSL still remains doubtful, however possible benefit from the TTR followed with HD-MTX with/without WBRT should be reconsidered.Copyright © 2015 The Neurosurgical Foundation.",Excluded
2823,"Coronary CT angiography performed by the novel whole organ volumetric high definition CT scanner in patients with atrial fibrillation Objectives: To evaluate the image quality, coronary interpretability and radiation exposure of coronary CT angiography (CCTA) performed with a newest generation of cardiac-CT scanner in patients with atrial fibrillation (AF). Background(s): Despite the relevant improvement in the CT temporal resolution that characterizes the last scanner generation, the evaluation of coronary arteries by CCTA in patients with AF remains the more challenging application of cardiac- CT, particularly in patients with heart rate (HR) >75 bpm. Moreover, the radiation exposure associated with CT is still very high in this clinical subset. Material(s) and Method(s): 49 patients (30 males, mean age 71,5+/-7,3 years old) with chronic AF undergoing CCTA for suspected CAD by using a novel whole organ volumetric high definition CT scanner (16cm z-axis coverage with 256 detector rows and 512 slices, gantry rotation time 0.28 sec), were enrolled in the study. Prospective ECG-triggering was used in all patients, of whom 20 with double-shot technique and the remaining 29 with single-shot technique. In all patients, image quality score (by a 4-point Likert scale on a per-segment level) and coronary interpretability were evaluated and the effective dose (ED) was recorded. Result(s): The mean HR during the scan was 87.7+/-22 bpm. The overall image quality was very high (Likert=3.4+/-1.2, excellent image quality=451 segments, good=206 segments, adequate=90 segments, poor/non diagnostic=19 segments). The overall coronary interpretability was 97.5% (747/766 segments); in patients performed with double-shot technique, the interpretability was 96.4%, whereas we found an interpretability of 98.4% with single-shot technique. The overall mean ED was 4.6+/-2.1 mSv, while a significantly lower dose (3.6+/-1.5 mSv) was measured for single-shot technique vs. double-shot approach (5.9+/-2.1 mSv, p<0.01). Conclusion(s): The novel whole organ high definition CT scanner allows to evaluate coronary arteries with high image quality and coronary interpretability and low radiation exposure in patients with atrial fibrillation and high HR during the scan.",Excluded
939,"Construction of a radiation hybrid panel and the first yellowtail (Seriola quinqueradiata) radiation hybrid map using a nanofluidic dynamic array BACKGROUND: Yellowtail (Seriola quinqueradiata) are an economically important species in Japan. However, there are currently no methods for captive breeding and early rearing for yellowtail. Thus, the commercial cultivation of this species is reliant upon the capture of wild immature fish. Given this, there is a need to develop captive breeding techniques to reduce pressure on wild stocks and facilitate the sustainable development of yellowtail aquaculture. We constructed a whole genome radiation hybrid (RH) panel for yellowtail gene mapping and developed a framework physical map using a nanofluidic dynamic array to use SNPs (single nucleotide polymorphisms) in ESTs (expressed sequence tags) for the DNA-assisted breeding of yellowtail., RESULTS: Clonal RH cell lines were obtained after ionizing radiation; specifically, 78, 64, 129, 55, 42, and 53 clones were isolated after treatment with 3,000, 4,000, 5,000, 6,000, 8,000, or 10,000 rads, respectively. A total of 421 hybrid cell lines were obtained by fusion with mouse B78 cells. Ninety-four microsatellite markers used in the genetic linkage map were genotyped using the 421 hybrid cell lines. Based upon marker retention and genome coverage, we selected 93 hybrid cell lines to form an RH panel. Importantly, we performed the first genotyping of yellowtail markers in an RH panel using a nanofluidic dynamic array (Fluidigm, CA, USA). Then, 580 markers containing ESTs and SNPs were mapped in the first yellowtail RH map., CONCLUSIONS: We successfully developed a yellowtail RH panel to facilitate the localization of markers. Using this, a framework RH map was constructed with 580 markers. This high-density physical map will serve as a useful tool for the identification of genes related to important breeding traits using genetic structural information, such as conserved synteny. Moreover, in a comparison of 30 sequences in the RH group 1 (SQ1), yellowtail appeared to be evolutionarily closer to medaka and the green-spotted pufferfish than to zebrafish. We suggest that synteny analysis may be potentially useful as a tool to investigate chromosomal evolution by comparison with model fish.",Excluded

2232,"Combined effects of glutathione S-transferase polymorphisms and thyroid cancer risk Since exposure to ionizing radiation, a risk factor for thyroid cancer, may produce genotoxins potentially eliminated by glutathione-S-transferases, we conducted a case control study to evaluate the role of the GSTM1- and GSTT1-null genotypes and GSTP1 polymorphisms in thyroid cancer. The frequency of GSTP1 Ile/Ile, GSTM1-, and GSTT1-null genotypes was increased in cancer patients when compared with control population. Considering the genotypes over-represented in thyroid cancer patients as potential risk genotypes, we carried out an odds ratio (OR) analysis considering the presence of none, one, two, or three risk genotypes. The results obtained showed that the presence of three potentially risk alleles (GSTM1 null, GSTT1 null, and GSTP1 Ile/Ile) lead to a significant OR increase for all the cases, irrespective of the type of tumor (OR=2.91), for papillary (OR=3.64) but not for follicular tumors. The presence of GSTP1 Ile/Ile leads to a significant later age of tumor onset when compared with GSTP1 Ile/Val and Val/Val (P<0.05), suggesting a possible association between GSTP1 Ile/Ile and the age of disease manifestation. These results suggest that combined GST polymorphisms lead to a moderate increased risk for thyroid cancer, especially for the papillary type, and GSTP1 polymorphisms might modulate the age of onset of the disease.",Excluded
243,"Hepatic irradiation augments engraftment of donor cells following hepatocyte transplantation Engraftment of donor hepatocytes is a critical step that determines the success of hepatocyte transplantation. Rapid and efficient integration of donor cells would enable prompt liver repopulation of these cells in response to selective proliferative stimuli offered by a preparative regimen. We have earlier demonstrated that hepatic irradiation (HIR) in combination with a variety of hepatotrophic growth signals, such as partial hepatectomy and hepatocyte growth factor, can be used as a preparative regimen for liver repopulation of transplanted hepatocytes. In this study, we investigated the effects of HIR on engraftment of transplanted dipeptidyl peptidase IV (DPPIV)-positive hepatocytes in congeneic DPPIV-deficient rats. HIR-induced apoptosis of hepatic sinusoidal endothelial cells (SEC) within 6 hours of HIR resulted in dehiscence of the SEC lining in 24 hours. Although there was no change of the number of Kupffer cells after HIR, colloidal carbon clearance decreased 24 hours post HIR, indicating a suppression of phagocytic function. DPPIV + donor cells were transplanted 24 hours after HIR (0-50 Gy). There was an HIR dose-dependent increase in the donor hepatocyte mass engrafted in the liver parenchyma. The number of viable transplanted hepatocytes present in hepatic sinusoids or integrated in the parenchyma was greater in the HIR-treated group at 3 and 7 days after transplantation compared with the sham controls. Finally, we validated these rodent studies in cynomolgus monkeys, demonstrating that a single 10-Gy dose of HIR was sufficient to enhance engraftment of donor porcine hepatocytes. These data indicate that transient disruption of the SEC barrier and inhibition of the phagocytic function of Kupffer cells by HIR enhances hepatocyte engraftment and the integrated donor cell mass. Thus, preparative HIR could be potentially useful to augment hepatocyte transplantation. Copyright © 2008 by the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases.",Excluded

318,"Prospective Pilot Study of Consolidation Chemotherapy With Docetaxel and Cisplatin After Concurrent Chemoradiotherapy for Advanced Head and Neck Cancer Purpose: With the improvement concurrent chemoradiotherapy (CCRT) in the management of patients with locoregionally advanced head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC), distant failures have become a more relevant problem in terms of survival. The primary objective of this Phase II study is to assess the feasibility of docetaxel and cisplatin consolidation after primary CCRT for patients with HNSCC. Methods and Materials: Patients with locoregionally advanced HNSCC received chemotherapy with three cycles of cisplatin, 100 mg/m2, on Days 1, 22, and 43. Concurrent radiotherapy to the primary tumor and neck was given in a daily dose of 2 Gy to a total dose of 70-70.2 Gy over 7 weeks. After completion of CCRT, patients without evidence of disease progression received an additional four cycles of consolidation chemotherapy with docetaxel, 75 mg/m2, and cisplatin, 75 mg/m2, every 3 weeks. Result(s): Of 33 patients, 27 (81%) completed CCRT. After CCRT, three complete and 19 partial responses were recorded, giving an overall response rate of 67%. Of 19 patients who went to the consolidation phase, only 4 (21%) received all four cycles of docetaxel and cisplatin. Causes of failure of consolidation chemotherapy were toxicity in 11 patients, including three treatment-related deaths, and progression in 4 patients. Three patients died of sepsis during the consolidation phase. Median survival was 11 months for all patients and 8 months for those treated with consolidation chemotherapy. Conclusion(s): The poor compliance and high incidence of severe toxicities prompted no further evaluation of this consolidation chemotherapy after CCRT. © 2008 Elsevier Inc.

2970,"Initial SRS for Patients With 5 to 15 Brain Metastases: Results of a Multi-Institutional Experience Purpose: Several studies evaluating stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) for patients with >4 brain metastases (BM) demonstrated similar outcomes after treatment of 1, 2 to 4, and 5 to 15 BM; others found clinically significant survival decrements in the latter group. In this review of 8 academic centers, we compared outcomes of patients undergoing initial SRS for 1, 2 to 4, and 5 to 15 BM. Methods and Materials: A total of 2089 patients treated with initial SRS for BM were included. Overall survival (OS) was estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method and compared using the log-rank test. Patient and disease characteristics were evaluated for association with OS and cumulative incidence of distant brain failure (DBF) using stepwise multivariable Cox proportional hazards and competing risk regression modeling. Result(s): In this series, 989 (47%) patients had 1 metastasis, 882 (42%) had 2 to 4 metastases, and 212 (10%) had 5 to 15 metastases treated. Median OS for the 1, 2 to 4, and 5 to 15 BM groups was 14.6, 9.5, and 7.5 months, respectively (log-rank P < .01). Univariate and multivariable analyses revealed no difference in survival between 2 to 4 and 5 to 15 BM. DBF at 1 year was 30%, 41%, and 50%, respectively (Gray's P < .01). Two-year cumulative incidence of salvage SRS decreased with increasing number of BM (1: 21% vs 2-4: 19% vs 5-15: 13%; P < .01), but no difference in salvage whole brain radiation therapy was observed (1: 12% vs 2-4: 15% vs 5-15: 16%, P = .10). At the time of DBF, median brain metastasis velocity was 3.9, 6.1, and 11.7 new metastases per year in the 1, 2 to 4, and 5 to 15 BM groups, respectively (P < .01). Conclusion(s): Patients treated with initial SRS for 5 to 15 BM experienced survival similar to that in patients with 2 to 4 BM.

The mean accumulated radiation dose to the nasopharynx was 112 +/- 30 Gy. Each patient underwent a battery of audiovestibular function tests, including audiometry and the dynamic illegible E, caloric, and rotational tests., RESULTS: Excluding 3 patients with neck fibrosis who could not perform the head turning movement, the remaining 9 patients displayed 100% abnormal dynamic illegible E test results and 100% abnormal refixation saccades. All 12 patients presented with bilateral hearing loss, caloric reductions, and reduced gains of the vestibular ocular reflex (VOR) on the rotational test, indicating bilateral VOR loss. After excluding tumor relapse and radiation necrosis of the brain by MRI, the oscillopsia in these 12 irradiated NPC patients was attributed to bilateral VOR loss., CONCLUSION: Radiation-induced oscillopsia in our NPC patients was attributed to bilateral VOR loss, possibly as a result of higher radiation doses. Hence, the therapeutic benefits of a second course of RT are associated with the potential risk of oscillopsia after RT.",Excluded

477,"Infrastructure of radiotherapy in the Netherlands: Evaluation of prognoses and introduction of a new model for determining the needs Background and purpose: In the Netherlands, the radiotherapy infrastructure is regulated by a Governmental license system. This requires timely and realistic prognostication of the needs for radiotherapy. In the present study, the latest prognoses (1993) and the realized changes in infrastructure are evaluated and a new prognosis for the period until 2010, which has been calculated using a new model, is presented. Material(s) and Method(s): Data on cancer incidence and use of radiotherapy were obtained from various published national reports and from a survey of all radiotherapy departments. Result(s): The cancer incidence over the period 1993-1997 was about 10% higher than predicted. In 1996 and 1997, the percentage of new cancer patients treated with radiotherapy was 45.6 and 48.2%, respectively. The absolute number of newly irradiated patients was about 10% higher than foreseen in the prognosis. The needs for radiotherapy infrastructure not only depend on epidemiological data and changes in indications for radiotherapy, but also on changes in types of treatment with different workloads. A new model, which uses four categories for teletherapy and four categories for brachytherapy is described and a new prognosis for the required number of linear accelerators and staff up to the year 2010 is presented. Conclusion(s): The original prognosis on cancer incidence and radiotherapy patients underestimated the actual figures considerably. The new prognosis, based on a model, which not only accounts for an increase in number of patients, but also for changes in treatment techniques, is expected to more accurately predict and acquire the required radiotherapy capacity. © 2003 Elsevier Science Ireland Ltd.

585,"Delineating chromosomal breakpoints in radiation-induced papillary thyroid cancer Recurrent translocations are well known hallmarks of many human solid tumors and hematological disorders, where patient- and breakpoint-specific information may facilitate prognostication and individualized therapy. In thyroid carcinomas, the proto-oncogenes RET and NTRK1 are often found to be activated through chromosomal rearrangements. However, many sporadic tumors and papillary thyroid carcinomas (PTCs) arising in patients with a history of exposure to elevated levels of ionizing irradiation do not carry these known abnormalities. We developed a rapid scheme to screen tumor cell metaphase spreads and identify candidate genes of tumorigenesis and neoplastic progression for subsequent functional studies. Using a series of overnight fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) experiments with pools comprised of bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) clones, it now becomes possible to rapidly refine breakpoint maps and, within one week, progress from the low resolution Spectral Karyotyping (SKY) maps or Giemsa-banding (G-banding) karyotypes to fully integrated, high resolution physical maps including a list of candiate genes in the critical regions. © 2011 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.",Excluded

The majority of patients (92%) were not informed of the radiation risks associated with tests that they were scheduled to receive and had false perceptions about the use of radiation and its associated risks. Physicians and medical students had misconceptions about the use of ionizing radiation in a number of radiologic examinations; for example, 25% and 43% of physicians and medical students, respectively, were unaware that interventional procedures used ionizing radiation, and 28% of physicians were unaware that mammography used ionizing radiation. Computed tomographies and barium studies were thought to be associated with the least ionizing radiation among physicians., CONCLUSION: There is a need for educating the public, medical students, and referring physicians about radiation exposure and associated risk so that (1) patients receiving multiple medical imaging tests are aware of the radiation that they are receiving and (2) physicians and future physicians will make informed decisions when ordering such tests to limit the amount of radiation that patients receive and to promote informed consent among patients.

The purpose of this pilot study was to test the potential of non-thermal pulsed light-emitting diode (LED) treatments (660 nm) prior to UV exposure in the induction of a state of cellular resistance against UV-induced erythema., STUDY DESIGN/MATERIALS AND METHODS: Thirteen healthy subjects and two patients with polymorphous light eruption (PLE) were exposed to 5, 6, or 10 LED treatments (660 nm) on an EXPERIMENTAL anterior thigh region. Individual baseline minimal erythema doses (MED) were then determined. UV radiation was thereafter performed on the LED EXPERIMENTAL and CONTROL anterior thigh areas. Finally, 24 hours post-UV irradiation, LED pre-treated MED responses were compared to the non-treated sites., RESULTS: Reduction of erythema was considered significant when erythema was reduced by >50% on the LED-treated side as opposed to CONTROL side. A significant LED treatment reduction in UV-B induced erythema reaction was observed in at least one occasion in 85% of subjects, including patients suffering from PLE. Moreover, there was evidence of a dose-related pattern in results. Finally, a sun protection factor SPF-15-like effect and a reduction in post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation were observed on the LED pre-treated side., CONCLUSIONS: Results suggest that LED based therapy prior to UV exposure provided significant protection against UV-B induced erythema. The induction of cellular resistance to UV insults may possibly be explained by the induction of a state a natural resistance to the skin via specific cell signaling pathways and without the drawbacks and limitations of traditional sunscreens. These results represent an encouraging step towards expanding the potential applications of LED therapy and could be useful in the treatment of patients with anomalous reactions to sunlight.",Excluded
1767,"The small molecule drug CBL0137 increases the level of DNA damage and the efficacy of radiotherapy for glioblastoma Glioblastoma (GBM) is an incurable brain tumor with inevitable recurrence. This is in part due to a highly malignant cancer stem cell (CSC) subpopulation of tumor cells that is particularly resistant to conventional treatments, including radiotherapy. Here we show that CBL0137, a small molecule anti-cancer agent, sensitizes GBM CSCs to radiotherapy. CBL0137 sequesters the FACT (facilitates chromatin transcription) complex to chromatin, resulting in cytotoxicity preferentially within tumor cells. We show that when combined with radiotherapy, CBL0137 inhibited GBM CSC growth and resulted in more DNA damage in the CSCs compared to irradiation or drug alone. Using an in vivo subcutaneous model, we showed that the frequency of GBM CSCs was reduced when tumors were pretreated with CBL0137 and then exposed to irradiation. Survival studies with orthotopic GBM models resulted in significantly extended survival for mice treated with combinatorial therapy. As GBM CSCs contribute to the inevitable recurrence in patients, targeting them is imperative.

Noninvasive tools to predict the presence and severity of PAD have limitations including inaccuracy, cost, or need for intravenous contrast and ionizing radiation., HYPOTHESIS: A clinical/biomarker score may offer an attractive alternative diagnostic method for PAD., METHODS: In a prospective cohort of 354 patients referred for diagnostic peripheral and/or coronary angiography, predictors of >=50% stenosis in >=1 peripheral vessel (carotid/subclavian, renal, or lower extremity arteries) were identified from >50 clinical variables and 109 biomarkers. Machine learning identified variables predictive of obstructive PAD; a score derived from the final model was developed., RESULTS: The score consisted of 1 clinical variable (history of hypertension) and 6 biomarkers (midkine, kidney injury molecule-1, interleukin-23, follicle-stimulating hormone, angiopoietin-1, and eotaxin-1). The model had an in-sample area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.85 for obstructive PAD and a cross-validated area under the curve of 0.84; higher scores were associated with greater severity of angiographic stenosis. At optimal cutoff, the score had 65% sensitivity, 88% specificity, 76% positive predictive value (PPV), and 81% negative predictive value (NPV) for obstructive PAD and performed consistently across vascular territories. Partitioning the score into 5 levels resulted in a PPV of 86% and NPV of 98% in the highest and lowest levels, respectively. Elevated score was associated with shorter time to revascularization during 4.3 years of follow-up., CONCLUSIONS: A clinical/biomarker score demonstrates high accuracy for predicting the presence of PAD.

993,"Magnetic resonance enterocolonography is useful for simultaneous evaluation of small and large intestinal lesions in Crohn's disease BACKGROUND: We developed novel magnetic resonance enterocolonography (MREC) for simultaneously evaluating both small and large bowel lesions in patients with Crohn's disease (CD). The aim of this study was to evaluate the diagnostic performance of MREC by comparing results of this procedure to those of endoscopies for evaluating the small and large bowel lesions of patients with CD., METHODS: Thirty patients with established CD were prospectively examined by newly developed MREC. Patients underwent ileocolonoscopy (ICS) (24 procedures) or double-balloon endoscopy (DBE) (10 procedures) after MREC on the same day. Two gastroenterologists and two radiologists who were blinded to the results of another study evaluated endoscopy and MREC findings, respectively., RESULTS: In colonic lesions the sensitivities of the MREC for deep mucosal lesions (DML), all CD lesions, and stenosis were 88.2, 61.8, and 71.4%, respectively, while the specificities were 98.1, 95.3, and 97.7%, respectively. In small intestinal lesions, MREC sensitivities for DML, all CD lesions, and stenosis were 100, 85.7, and 100%, respectively, while specificities were 100, 90.5, and 93.1%, respectively. Endoscopic scores were significantly correlated with MREC scores. Eleven (46%) of the 24 patients who were clinically not suspected to show stricture were observed to demonstrate stricture by radiologists., CONCLUSIONS: Our results demonstrated that MREC can simultaneously detect the CD lesions of the small and large intestine. MREC can be performed without radiation exposure, the use of enema, or the placement of a naso-jejunal catheter. MREC and endoscopy have comparable abilities for evaluating mucosal lesions of patients with CD. Copyright © 2010 Crohn's & Colitis Foundation of America, Inc.",Excluded
963,"High incidence of mosaic mutations induced by irradiating paternal germ cells of the medaka fish, Oryzias latipes Delayed-type mutations induced by radiation have recently been demonstrated in various somatic-cell systems. Such mutations are thought to result from the transmission of genetic instability through many cell divisions subsequent to a single exposure to ionizing radiation. Here, we have examined whether 'transgenerational' delayed-type mutations can arise during embryonic development of the medaka fish as a result of exposing the sperm and spermatids of live fish to 137 Cs gamma-radiation. To do this, we made use of a sensitive specific-locus test (SLT) for the medaka that we have recently developed. Because the medaka has a transparent egg membrane and embryo body, both visible mosaics and whole-body mutations can be detected during development at an early-expressed pigmentation locus. When wild-type +/+ males were gamma-irradiated and then mated with wl/wl females, the frequency of F1 embryos with both wild-type orange leucophores (wl/+) and mutant-type white leucophores (wl/wl*) (mosaic mutants) was about 5.7 x 10-3/Gy. The frequency of embryos with only white leucophores (whole-body mutants) was about 1.3 x 10-3/Gy. These results suggest that delayed mutations frequently arise in medaka fish embryos that have been fertilized with irradiated sperm. Some possible mechanisms involved in the generation of these delayed mutational events (including genomic instability in the early embryos) are discussed. © 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.",Excluded

2247,"Increased risk for vertebral fractures with long-term observation in mild primary hyperparathyroidism: Five year data from the scandinavian investigation of primary hyperparathyroidism (SIPH) Introduction Cohort studies using surrogate endpoints suggest decreased fracture risk after parathyroidectomy in patients with asymptomatic primary hyperparathyroidism (PHPT), but long-term prospective studies are lacking. Here we report 5 year data on bone mineral density (BMD) and vertebral fracture (VF) incidence from the SIPH study1, where patients with PHPT were randomized to either parathyroidectomy (PTX) or observation (OBS). Methods Data were available from 130 patients (OBS n= 67, PTX n= 63) 5 years after randomization (mean age at inclusion 62 years, 9 men in each group). Baseline biochemistry (total Calcium (Ca), Parathyroid hormone (PTH), Creatinine) and BMD Z-scores by DXA (Z) for lumbar spine (LS) and femoral neck (FN) were similar in the two groups. Lateral radiographs of the thoracolumbar spine were obtained at baseline, and after 2 and 5 years. Two radiologists, blinded to randomization and clinical data, evaluated the radiographs in consensus, using the semiquantitative method of Genant2 (including also L5). Results Basic biochemistry was stable in the OBS group, and normalized after parathyroidectomy (P< 0.001 for Ca and PTH). For the OBS group, baseline BMD Z in LS was -0.3 (IQR: -1.25 to +1.0) and in FN-0.2 (IQR: -0.9 to +0.5). After 5 years BMD Z in LS was-0.2 (IQR: -1.2 to +0.6) and in FN -0.6 (IQR: -1.0 to +0.1); not significant for both sites. For the PTX group, baseline BMD Z in LS was -0.2 (IQR: -1.0 to +1.0) and in FN -0.3 (IQR: 1.0 to +0.3). After 5 years BMD Z in LS increased to +0.4 (IQR: -0.7 to +1.2) and in FN to -0.2 (IQR: -0.7 to +0.4); P< 0.01 for both sites. The change in Z-scores (LS; FN) was different between OBS and PTX (P=0.04; P=0.013). At 5 years, X-rays were available for 110 patients (15 men) with baseline radiographs and at least one follow-up radiograph. Fifty-six patients were randomized to OBS (6 men) and 54 to PTX (9 men). Total follow-up time was 267.9 years (mean 4.8 years) in the OBS group and 271.5 years (mean 5.0 years) in the PTX group. There were 12 VFs in 10 patients (all women; 9.1% of all patients) at baseline (4 OBS patients with 6 VFs, 6 PTX patients with 6 VFs). During follow-up, 5 new VFs occurred in 5 patients (women), exclusively in the OBS group. Thus, 8.9% of the patients randomized to OBS, and none in the PTX group (P= 0.029), developed a new VF. Four of the new VFs occurred in patients with no VFs at baseline. All new VFs were of mild to moderate degree, and none had symptoms that could be related to the VF. Conclusion Five years after randomization, biochemistry and BMD Z-scores were stable with observation. Following parathyroidectomy biochemistry normalized and BMD Z-scores increased. New nonsymptomatic vertebral fractures developed in 5 females in the observation group, a significantly higher risk for fractures than following surgery.",Excluded
930,"Quantification of coronary artery calcium on the basis of dual-energy coronary CT angiography PURPOSE: To evaluate the feasibility of using virtual noncontrast material-enhanced (VNC) computed tomographic (CT) series derived from dual-energy CT imaging studies for coronary artery calcium quantification., MATERIALS AND METHODS: This HIPAA-compliant study was institutional review board approved; all patients provided written informed consent. Thirty-six patients prospectively underwent noncontrast-enhanced CT calcium scoring followed by coronary CT angiography performed in dual-energy mode. By using different reconstruction algorithms, three VNC series were generated and evaluated for noise and efficiency of virtual iodine removal. Two readers independently quantified calcium on VNC images and true noncontrast-enhanced conventional calcium scoring series. A leave-one-out cross validation was used to assess the accuracy of calcium score prediction from VNC series by means of linear regression., RESULTS: CT value histograms of the VNC series closely resembled the profile in the true noncontrast-enhanced series. There was excellent correlation between calcium volumes on the VNC series and true noncontrast-enhanced series on a per-patient (r = 0.94, P < .001, n = 36) and per-vessel (r = 0.94, 0.91, and 0.92 for the three coronary arteries, all P < .001, n = 36 each) level. The ability of a linear regression model to predict actual calcium scores from calcium volumes on VNC series was excellent (r = 0.82). Multiethnic Study of Atherosclerosis rankings that were derived from the predicted calcium scores also showed excellent agreement (intraclass correlation coefficient = 0.909)., CONCLUSION: Coronary artery calcium identification and quantification based on dual-energy coronary CT angiographic studies may obviate the need for dedicated CT calcium scoring studies.

2361,"Early pre-cut fistulotomy reduces the fluoroscopy time and radiation dose in patients with difficult biliary cannulation Background Role of pre-cut fistulotomy in reducing fluoroscopy time and radiation dose in difficult selective biliary cannulation is unknown. Methods This is a prospective randomized controlled trial where patients with difficult biliary cannulation were randomized into 2 groups, viz, Group I -Early pre-cut fistulotomy after difficult biliary cannulation at 5 minutes and Group II- Late pre-cut fistulotomy after failure of conventional methods of selective biliary cannulation for 15 minutes. We compared the success rates of selective biliary cannulation along with fluoroscopy time and radiation dose, the complication rates, need for repeat Endoscopic retrograde cholangiography (ERC) and need for other interventions in early and late pre-cut fistulotomy. Results Of the 130 eligible patients screened, 40 patients were randomized. The technical success was comparable between early and late group. The ERC time was less and the fluoroscopy time and radiation dose were significantly less in the early group (4 minutes [3, 6] vs. 15 minutes [8, 28], p=0.001) and (1.35 mGy [0.90, 1.63] vs. 2.40 mGy [1.58, 3.25], p=0.010) respectively. In the late group, 60 % required need for rescue pre-cut fistulotomy. One patient from late group developed PEP while 1 from early developed perforation. Three needed other interventions due to failed second attempt. Conclusion Early pre-cut fistulotomy has comparable technical success and reduces the time and dose of fluoroscopy as compared to late pre-cut fistulotomy for difficult biliary cannulation.",Excluded
36,"CT findings of KUB injury in Hemodynamically stable blunt abdominal injury patients with microscopic hematuria Background: According to controversial guideline for management in case of hemodynamically stable blunt abdominal injury with microscopic hematuria. Most of the patients could be omitted for abdominal computed tomography (CT). Despite high sensitivity and specificity of abdominal CT, in addition to high medical cost, there are risks from radiation exposure and adverse reaction from use of contrast media. Objective(s): To evaluate the prevalence of KUB injury on abdominal CT in case of hemodynamically stable blunt abdominal injury with microscopic hematuria. Material(s) and Method(s): Forty-one studies of abdominal CT performed during 1 January 2010 and 30 June 2012 were retrospectively reviewed for KUB injury (categorized by AAST organ injury scale) by consensus of two experienced radiologists. Result(s): KUB injury was found in 36.6% from all selected CT studies. Almost all cases could be managed conservatively. The cutoff point of microscopic hematuria at 20 cells/hpf has sensitivity 80% and specificity 46.15%. Conclusion(s): One-third of the patients have KUB injury but almost all of them could be conservatively managed. We proposed that the cutoff point of hematuria be equivalent to or greater than 20 cells/hpf to be one of the indicators for predicting KUB injury that needs radiological evaluation; but it should be carefully considered along with clinical information.Copyright © 2015 Medical Association of Thailand.

129,"[Large mantle fields--indication, technic, tolerance and side effects] In our Department, the technique of large mantle fields has proved to be a good therapeutic means for supradiaphragmatic and infradiaphragmatic irradiation of several lymph node groups in one irradiation field. With this technique the lymph node groups needing a treatment can be irradiated without overlappings or gaps, and thus the therapy reliability is considerably improved. The side effects are limited with respect to the large volume dose, in the individual case they can easily be eliminated by reducing the single dose. Gastrointestinal side effects can be controlled by chemotherapy in a satisfactory manner. Only in very few cases the modifications of the white blood count necessitated a short interruption of the therapy cycle. Furthermore, the simplified and easily reproducible focussing of the individual fields is especially appreciated by the technical staff.",Excluded

39,"A comparison of normal tissue complication probability of brain for proton and photon therapy of canine nasal tumors This study compared the calculated normal tissue complication probability of brain in dogs with a nasal tumor, which had both photon and proton treatment planning. Nine dogs diagnosed with a variety of histologies, but all with large, caudally located nasal tumors were studied. Three-dimensional (3-D) photon dose distribution, and a proton dose distribution was calculated for each dog. To calculate the normal tissue complication probability (NTCP) for brain, the partial brain volume irradiated with the prescribed dose was determined, then a mathematic model relating complications to partial volume and radiation dose was used. The NTCP was always smaller for proton plans as compared to photon plans, indicating conformation of the dose to the target allows a higher dose to be given. If a 5% NTCP were accepted, the mean applicable dose for this group of dogs was 50.2 Gy for photons, but 58.3 Gy for protons. Not all dogs would benefit the same from proton irradiation. If a large partial brain volume has to be irradiated, the advantage becomes minimal. There is also a minimal advantage if the planning target volume (PTV) includes a small, superficial brain volume. However, for a complex PTV shape the degree of conformation is clearly superior for protons and results in smaller calculated NTCPs.",Excluded
2901,"Transgenerational effects of preconception paternal contamination with (55)Fe The conjecture that germline mutations induced by radiation exposure before conception may predispose subsequent offspring to cancer remains contentious. Previous experimental studies have shown that preconception paternal irradiation with (239)Pu induces perturbations in the hemopoietic systems of offspring and influences sensitivity to a secondary carcinogen. In the present study, male DBA2 mice were injected intravenously with the Auger electron emitter (55)Fe (4 kBq g(-1)) 18 or 84 days before mating with normal females. Comet analysis showed an increased incidence of DNA strand breaks in sperm from contaminated animals after 84 days, but not after 18 days, indicating spermatogonial rather than spermatid damage. Offspring were either assayed for changes in bone marrow stem cells and committed progenitors or challenged with the chemical carcinogen methyl nitrosourea (MNU, 50 mg/kg) at 10 weeks of age and monitored for the onset of malignancy. Offspring from irradiated fathers had normal peripheral blood profiles, although the stem cell population was amplified in offspring arising from those exposed to (55)Fe at 84 days before conception. Exposure to MNU significantly increased the incidence of lympho-hemopoietic malignancies in offspring from the 84-day group, but not in those from the 18-day group. These findings support the hypothesis that aberrations that are potentially leukemogenic may be transmitted to offspring after radiation damage to the paternal germline.",Excluded

The obtained results were compared with a control group. Besides that subgroups were isolated taking into account the sex of the studied subjects and duration of their work with X-ray equipment (over five years and below five years). In the workers handling X-ray equipment and in the isolated subgroups of women and men, the index of spontaneous NBT reduction turned out to be statistically significantly higher than that in the control group. In the group of studied workers the index of latex-stimulated NBT reduction was statistically significantly lower than that in the control group. Taking into account the duration of work with X-ray equipment in the subgroups of women and men working for over five years, the lowest index of phagocytes was noted. On the basis of the obtained results the following conclusions were formulated: 1. In workers handling X-ray equipment disturbances occur of peripheral blood neutrophil metabolism assessed in the NBT test. 2. Neutrophil phagocytic activity is weakened in persons working over five years with X-ray equipment.",Included
3585,"Angiographic derived endothelial shear stress: A new predictor of atherosclerotic disease progression Aims To examine the efficacy of angiography derived endothelial shear stress (ESS) in predicting atherosclerotic disease progression. Methods and results Thirty-five patients admitted with ST-elevation myocardial infarction that had three-vessel intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) immediately after revascularization and at 13 months follow-up were included. Three dimensional (3D) reconstruction of the non-culprit vessels were performed using (i) quantitative coronary angiography (QCA) and (ii) methodology involving fusion of IVUS and biplane angiography. In both models, blood flow simulation was performed and the minimum predominant ESS was estimated in 3mm segments. Baseline plaque characteristics and ESS were used to identify predictors of atherosclerotic disease progression defied as plaque area increase and lumen reduction at follow-up. Fifty-four vessels were included in the final analysis. A moderate correlation was noted between ESS estimated in the 3D QCA and the IVUS-derived models (r = 0.588, P < 0.001); 3D QCA accurately identified segments exposed to low (<1 Pa) ESS in the IVUS-based reconstructions (AUC: 0.793, P < 0.001). Low 3D QCA-derived ESS (<1.75 Pa) was associated with an increase in plaque area, burden, and necrotic core at follow-up. In multivariate analysis, low ESS estimated either in 3D QCA [odds ratio (OR): 2.07, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.17-3.67; P = 0.012) or in IVUS (<1 Pa; OR: 2.23, 95% CI: 1.23-4.03; P = 0.008) models, and plaque burden were independent predictors of atherosclerotic disease progression; 3D QCA and IVUS-derived models had a similar accuracy in predicting disease progression (AUC: 0.826 vs. 0.827, P = 0.907). Conclusions 3D QCA-derived ESS can predict disease progression. Further research is required to examine its value in detecting vulnerable plaques.Copyright © The Author(s) 2019.",Excluded
1179,"Radical chemoradiotherapy for elderly patients with bladder carcinoma invading muscle BACKGROUND: Chemoradiotherapy is becoming an alternative to radical cystectomy among patients with bladder carcinoma invading muscle. In 1988, the authors began a protocol with methotrexate, vinblastine, doxorubicin, and cisplatin (M-VAC regimen) and radiotherapy for these patients. Traditionally, age has been considered a determinant factor thereby excluding the older patients from the oncologic protocols that are considered to be more aggressive. The authors analyzed 20 patients (age > 70 years) who were treated during this period with the same protocol as the authors' other patients., METHODS: The study included 20 patients (age range, 70-78 years; median age, 74 years) including 4 patients with T2 disease, 9 with T3 disease, and 7 with T4 disease. All patients had a Karnofsky performance status of > 60. Treatment protocol included cytoreductive transurethral resection, 2 cycles of M-VAC chemotherapy, and radiotherapy (45 grays [Gy] on pelvic volume) with concurrent cisplatin (20 mg/m2 on Days 1-5. Response was determined by cystoscopic evaluation. If there was a complete response, radiotherapy continued until a total dose of 65 Gy; if there was not a complete response, cystectomy was performed., RESULTS: Tumor response after a dose of 45 Gy included 11 complete responses (55%), 5 partial responses (25%), and 4 nonresponses (20%). Overall survival was 75%, 34%, and 27% in the 2nd, 3rd, and 5th years of follow-up, respectively. Cause specific survival was 79%, 54%, and 38%, respectively. Survival for patients with complete response was 100%, 60%, and 48%, respectively. Severe toxicity was uncommon, with the most frequent toxicities being leukopenia and cystitis. No treatment-related death occurred with either treatment protocol., CONCLUSIONS: The age of the individual must not become a strict exclusion criterion for the radical treatment of old patients with invasive bladder carcinoma.",Excluded
3051,"Low contrast and radiation dose coronary CT angiography using a 320-row system and a refined contrast injection and timing method BACKGROUND: Among CT scanners, 320-row instruments feature decreased photon energy and yield strong contrast enhancement. Consequently, the contrast medium (CM) dose can be reduced. The results of low-tube-voltage coronary CT angiography (CCTA) performed on 320-row scanners have not been adequately assessed., OBJECTIVE: We evaluated the effects of a low-contrast-dose protocol on the image quality of CCTA using 80 kVp tube voltage, iterative reconstruction (IR), and a 320-row scanner., METHODS: We randomly assigned 90 patients (mean body weight, 56.5 +/- 11.0 kg) to 1 of 3 CCTA protocols. Under protocol A, 30 were scanned using a conventional 120-kVp protocol and a standard CM dose (280 mg iodine/kg body weight [mgI/kg]). Another 30 underwent scanning at 80 kVp with a 25% CM dose reduction (210 mgI/kg; protocol B). Under protocol C, the remaining 30 patients were scanned at 80 kVp with a 50% CM dose reduction (140 mgI/kg). The 120 and 80 kVp images were processed with IR. Images obtained under the 3 protocols were subjected to quantitative and qualitative analysis., RESULTS: The amount of CM used in protocol A, B, and C was 43.6 +/- 10.1, 30.3 +/- 4.4, and 21.0 +/- 4.0 mL, respectively. Mean CT attenuation of the coronary arteries tended to be higher under protocol B than the other 2 protocols. The contrast-to-noise ratio was significantly higher under protocol B. The mean visual scores were significantly higher for protocols A and B than protocol C. The mean effective radiation dose was significantly lower under the 80-kVp protocol., CONCLUSION: With a 320-row scanner and our refined CM injection and timing protocol, it is technically feasible to obtain sufficient vascular enhancement with a reduction in the CM and/or radiation dose at 80-kVp CCTA with IR.

Radiation dose and image quality were compared between the three DSCT systems., Results: The statistically significantly highest subjective and objective image quality was evaluated for the third generation DSCT when compared to the first or second generation DSCT systems (all p < 0.05). Total effective dose was 63 %/39 % lower for the third generation examination as compared to the first and second generation DSCT., Conclusions: Temporal bone imaging without z-axis-UHR-filter and a novel third generation IR algorithm allows for significantly higher image quality while lowering effective dose when compared to the first two generations of DSCTs.Copyright © 2014, European Society of Radiology.",Excluded
3111,"Prediction of coronary artery calcium progression in individuals with low Framingham Risk Score: the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis OBJECTIVES: This study sought to determine whether novel markers not involving ionizing radiation could predict coronary artery calcium (CAC) progression in a low-risk population., BACKGROUND: Increase in CAC scores over time (CAC progression) improves prediction of coronary heart disease (CHD) events. Due to radiation exposure, CAC measurement represents an undesirable method for repeated risk assessment, particularly in individuals with low predicted risk (Framingham Risk Score [FRS] <10%)., METHODS: From 6,814 participants in MESA (Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis), 2,620 individuals were classified as low risk for CHD events (FRS <10%) and had follow-up CAC measurement. In addition to traditional risk factors (RFs), various combinations of novel marker models were selected on the basis of data-driven, clinical, or backward stepwise selection techniques., RESULTS: Mean follow-up was 2.5 years. CAC progression occurred in 574 participants (22% overall; 214 of 1,830 with baseline CAC = 0 and 360 of 790 with baseline CAC >0). Addition of various combinations of novel markers to the base model (c statistic = 0.711) revealed improvements in discrimination of approximately only 0.005 each (c statistics 0.7158, 0.7160, and 0.7164) for the best-fit models. All 3 best-fit novel marker models calibrated well but were similar to the base model in predicting individual risk probabilities for CAC progression. The highest prevalence of CAC progression occurred in the highest compared with the lowest probability quartile groups (39.2% to 40.3% vs. 6.4% to 7.1%)., CONCLUSIONS: In individuals at low predicted risk according to FRS, traditional risk factors predicted CAC progression in the short term with good discrimination and calibration. Prediction improved minimally when various novel markers were added to the model. Copyright A© 2012 American College of Cardiology Foundation. Published by Elsevier Inc.

1701,"Hyperparathyroidism after thyroid surgery and autotransplantation of histologically normal parathyroid glands BACKGROUND: Parathyroid autotransplantation is a well-established method to prevent hypoparathyroidism during parathyroid and thyroid operations. The reported success rate of parathyroid autotransplantation ranges from 75% to 100%. Recurrent hyperparathyroidism may develop after parathyroid autotransplantation, especially after the transplantation of hyperplastic or adenomatous parathyroid tissue. Hyperparathyroidism recurs most frequently after subtotal parathyroidectomy or total parathyroidectomy and autotransplantation, in patients with renal failure and secondary hyperparathyroidism, and in patients with familial primary hyperparathyroidism or MEN I or MEN II syndrome. We report three patients who experienced primary hyperparathyroidism after autotransplantation of normal parathyroid tissue during thyroid operations (two patients) or after a long period of hypoparathyroidism., STUDY DESIGN: We reviewed our records from 1983 to May 1998 and identified three patients in whom hyperparathyroidism developed after thyroid operations., RESULTS: One patient had a thyroidectomy with left modified radical neck dissection for papillary thyroid cancer, followed by radioiodine ablative therapy. Two patients had thyroid operations for benign thyroid disease. One of these patients had a history of radiation exposure for acne, and in the other one secondary hyperparathyroidism arose 6 years after a thyroidectomy for hyperthyroidism., CONCLUSIONS: Our study documents that hyperparathyroidism may develop after autotransplantation of histologically normal parathyroid tissue and after a period of hypoparathyroidism after thyroid operations.

2895,"Do radiation-induced bystander effects correlate to the intrinsic radiosensitivity of individuals and have clinical significance? It is well known that patients can vary in their normal tissue response to radiotherapy, and this can be problematic. As a result, radiobiologists have been using in vitro models to assess variation in response and elucidate the genetic determinants of this variation. However, the clinical relevance of these models is currently unknown. In this study, blood samples from healthy controls (n 20) and colorectal carcinoma patients (n 60) were cultured in vitro to assess two radiobiological end points in parallel: intrinsic radiosensitivity assayed by chromosomal aberrations (G2 scores) and radiation-induced bystander effects assayed by viability testing. Increased intrinsic radiosensitivity was observed in colorectal carcinoma donors (55) compared to the healthy donors (5) (P < 0.005). Similarly, more pronounced radiation-induced bystander effects were observed in the colorectal carcinoma donors compared to the healthy donors after 24 h exposure but not after 96 h exposure to donor irradiated cell conditioned medium (ICCM) (P < 0.05). All scores were tested for correlation with the age, sex and clinical stage of the colorectal carcinoma patients. The only statistically significant correlation was found in samples from severe Dukes D patients (P < 0.005), which had low/radioresistant G2 scores. No correlation was found between radiation-induced intrinsic sensitivity and bystander effects, which suggests that they may have separate underlying molecular mechanisms, but they both show clinical relevance in individual patient samples. © 2009 The Radiation Research Society.",Included
913,"Should adjuvant radiotherapy be recommended following resection of regional lymph node metastases of malignant melanomas? Background: Several authors have recommended adjuvant radiotherapy following resection of regional lymph node metastases in cutaneous malignant melanoma. There is, however, little evidence from controlled trials that patients benefit from this treatment. Objective(s): To evaluate the usefulness of adjuvant, radiotherapy following resection of lymph node metastases in cutaneous malignant melanoma. Method(s): We performed a retrospective study comparing 58 patients who underwent radiotherapy following resection of regional lymph node metastases with 58 controls from another centre who exclusively underwent regional lymphadenectomy. Patients and their controls were matched with respect to the number of tumour-bearing lymph nodes (1 vs. 1) and to gender, although the proportion of thick tumours was greater in the irradiation group. Result(s): The overall survival curves were almost identical in the two groups. There were nine disease recurrences in the study group and 12 in the control group (not significant). Regional recurrences in the irradiated patients were usually accompanied by metastases at other sites. Conclusion(s): The present study does not support the recommendation of adjuvant radiotherapy following resection of regional lymph node metastases in patients with malignant melanoma.",Included

1211,"Ischaemic heart disease incidence and mortality in an extended cohort of Mayak workers first employed in 1948-1982 Objective: Incidence and mortality from ischaemic heart disease (IHD) was studied in an extended cohort of 22,377 workers first employed at the Mayak Production Association during 1948-82 and followed up to the end of 2008. Method(s): Relative risks and excess relative risks per unit dose (ERR/Gy) were calculated based on the maximum likelihood using Epicure software (Hirosoft International Corporation, Seattle, WA). Dose estimates used in analyses were provided by an updated ""Mayak Worker Dosimetry System-2008"". Result(s): A significant increasing linear trend in IHD incidence with total dose from external g-rays was observed after having adjusted for non-radiation factors and dose from internal radiation {ERR/Gy50.10 [95% confidence interval (CI): 0.04 to 0.17]}. The pure quadratic model provided a better fit of the data than did the linear one. No significant association of IHD mortality with total dose from external g-rays after having adjusted for nonradiation factors and dose from internal alpha radiation was observed in the study cohort [ERR/Gy50.06 (95% CI: ,0 to 0.15)]. A significant increasing linear trend was observed in IHD mortality with total absorbed dose from internal alpha radiation to the liver after having adjusted for non-radiation factors and dose from external g-rays in both the whole cohort [ERR/Gy50.21 (95% CI: 0.01 to 0.58)] and the subcohort of workers exposed at alpha dose ,1.00Gy [ERR/Gy51.08 (95% CI: 0.34 to 2.15)]. No association of IHD incidence with total dose from internal alpha radiation to the liver was found in the whole cohort after having adjusted for non-radiation factors and external gamma dose [ERR/Gy50.02 (95% CI: not available to 0.10)]. Statistically significant dose effect was revealed in the subcohort of workers exposed to internal alpha radiation at dose to the liver ,1.00Gy [ERR/Gy50.44 (95% CI: 0.09 to 0.85)]. Conclusion(s): This study provides strong evidence of IHD incidence and mortality association with external g-ray exposure and some evidence of IHDincidence andmortality association with internal alpha-radiation exposure. Advances in knowledge: It is the first time the validity of internal radiation dose estimates has been shown to affect the risk of IHD incidence.Copyright © The Authors Publised by the British Institute of Radiology.",Included
2469,"Effects of prolonged weightlessness on mental rotation of three-dimensional objects Previous experiments have suggested that the analysis of visual images could be a gravity-dependent process. We investigated this hypothesis using a mental rotation paradigm with pictures of three-dimensional objects during a 26-day orbital flight aboard the Soviet MIR station. The analysis of cosmonauts' response times showed that the mental rotation task is not greatly impaired in weightlessness. On the contrary, there are indications of a facilitation as: (1) the average rotation time per degree was shorter inflight than on the ground; (2) this difference seemed to be particularly marked for stimuli calling for roll axis rotations. However several factors may be responsible for this difference which was not obvious in one subject. Further experiments will have to test if this effect is really due to exposure to microgravity.",Excluded

Epidemiologic studies of underground miners with exposure to radon and experimental evidence have established that radon causes lung cancer. The finding that this naturally occurring carcinogen is present in the air of homes and other buildings has raised concern about the lung cancer risk to the general population from radon. I review current approaches for assessing the risk of indoor radon, emphasizing the extrapolation of the risks for miners to the general population. Although uncertainties are inherent in this risk assessment, the present evidence warrants identifying homes that have unacceptably high concentrations.",Excluded

672,"Thyroid and parathyroid function in long-term survivors of stem cell transplantation after 10-14Gy total body irradiation Thyroid and parathyroid dysfunction are well described complications of irradiation to the neck. In this study we have evaluated the incidence of thyroid and parathyroid dysfunction in long term survivors of SCT attending a dedicated haematology/ endocrine follow-up clinic. All patients were transplanted for haematological malignancy and had total body irradiation (TBI) as part of their pre-transplant conditioning regimen. 76 patients (37 female) were investigated a median of 18 years post SCT (range 8-29). The median dose of TBI was 12Gy (range 10-14) given in conjunction with cyclophosphamide. 61 patients were treated for CML and 15 patients were treated for acute leukemia. 21 out of 76 patients (28%) developed hypothyroidism and there were no cases of hyperthyroidism. Among male patients the prevalence was 26% compared to <1% in normal populations. Among women the prevalence was 30% compared to a normal prevalence of 0.1-2%. The median time after SCT that hypothyroidism developed was 13 years but the range was wide at 4.5-24 years. None of our patients had laboratory evidence of hypoparathyroidism (low calcium with inappropriately non-elevated PTH). 16 patients had a raised PTH level. Of these, 12/16 had a calcium level in the lower end of the normal range (2.16-2.4 mmol/l) making primary hyperparathyroidism unlikely. The majority (11/12) of these patients had low vitamin D levels making secondary hyperparathyroidism the most likely diagnosis. Of four patients with elevated PTH and calcium levels >2.4 mmol/ l, none had convincing evidence of primary hyperparathyroidism. One patient had renal impairment and secondary/tertiary hyperparathyroidism; a second was taking bendrofluazide; a third was vitamin D deficient. A fourth patient was hypocalciuric with a 24 hour urinary calcium/creatinine ratio <0.01; this excludes primary hyperparathyroidism and makes the diagnosis of familial hypocalciuric hypercalcemia likely. In summary, there was a high prevalence of hypothyroidism (28%) among our patients. Conversely there were no cases of primary hyperparathyroidism or hypoparathyroidism but longer follow up will be necessary to clarify the effect of these doses of TBI on parathyroid function. Secondary hyperparathyroidism was frequent, particularly in association with low vitamin D levels. We conclude that indefinite surveillance is needed to identify thyroid dysfunction after SCT and vitamin D levels should be part of routine annual follow up investigations.",Excluded
2322,"Evaluation and management of pericardial effusion in patients with neoplastic disease The incidence and extent of pericardial involvement in neoplastic disease varies. In a considerable number of patients with breast or lung cancer or with mediastinal lymphoma, in addition to direct involvement by the tumor, radiation therapy as well as systemic tumor treatment can also lead to pericardial effusion. In addition, in immunosuppressed tumor patients, pericardial effusion can also arise from viral, bacterial, and autoimmune causes. To distinguish between these 3 different conditions leading to pericardial effusion, the diagnosis should be based on pericardiocentesis followed by fluid analysis for cytology and biomarkers, on epicardial and pericardial biopsy facilitated by flexible pericardioscopy with analysis of specimens by conventional histology and molecular biology techniques for viral and microbial aetiology. We collected prospectively but analyzed retrospectively 357 patients undergoing pericardiocentesis from 1988 to 2008 and identified 68 patients who had cancer-related pericardial effusion. With these methods, 42 patients demonstrated malignant effusion, 15 patients had radiation-induced pericardial, effusion, and in 11 patients without radiation therapy, the effusion could be attributed to either viral infection in 5 cases or to an autoimmune process in the remaining 6 patients. Consequently, intrapericardial treatment could be tailored for each cohort: neoplastic effusion was treated with intrapericardial cisplatin (single instillation of 30 mg/m(2) per 24 hours); in addition to the tumor-specific systemic chemotherapy, intrapericardial triamcinolone acetate (Volon A) was given in a dose of 500 mg/m(2) in the patients with autoimmune and radiation-induced effusion. Saline rinsing and intrapericardial sclerosing treatment were the treatment of choice in viral pericardial effusion. Oral colchicine treatment (2-3 x 0.5 mg) was given in all patients for at least 3 months. Recurrence of pericardial effusion was prevented for at least 3 months in more than 85% of patients. This differential diagnostic approach and the results of treatment were compared with published series. Copyright 2010 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.",Excluded

223,"Personalized space radiation dosimetry using monte carlo simulations of CT-based geometries exposed to solar particle event radiation Purpose/Objective(s): A serious concern for space exploration to the Moon or Mars is astronaut exposure to ionizing radiation in a solar particle event (SPE). SPE are unpredictable, variable in intensity and energy spectrum, and are primarily protons with kinetic energies below 100 MeV. The dose from an SPE is highly inhomogeneous and sensitive to physical parameters such as energy spectrum, shielding, and anisotropy. The biological effects of low dose-rate proton radiation are not fully understood. Interpretation of data from ground-based experiments in animal models is complicated by inhomogeneous distribution of dose to sensitive organs. Planning and preparation for space exploration vitally relies on accurate prediction of the health risk associated with exposure to SPE. Materials/Methods: We have developed a Monte Carlo radiation transport tool that incorporates CT scans into dose calculations of radiobiological experiments in animal models and simulated exposure of humans to SPE radiation. This allows accurate predictions of SPE dose and is used to develop dose-toxicity data for pre-clinical animal experiments and for predicting astronaut organ doses from exposure to SPE radiation. Result(s): We validated this tool using phantom measurements and determine organ doses for Yucatan mini-pigs exposed to simulated SPE radiation designed to match 3 historical events with relatively low (October, 1989), intermediate (September, 1989) and high (August, 1972) levels of >100 MeV protons to model toxicity vs dose in critical internal organs. These studies show a paradoxical increase in clinical/systemic toxicity for SPE with lower internal dose that appears to correlate with suppression of leukocyte counts. For astronaut SPE exposures, we applied this tool to 4 different human model (2 male, 2 female) astronauts exposed to the 3 SPE in geometries designed to simulate exposure within a space suit or capsule. The results indicate that not only does an astronaut's dose to specific organs (e.g., skin, eyes, and lungs) differ substantially for different SPE, different astronauts receive significantly different organ doses even with the same SPE exposure. Conclusion(s): These studies clearly show the value of our dosimetry system for two critically interrelated uses: determining the dose to organ systems for SPE exposed astronauts and helping ensure that earth based experiments reproduce appropriate dose distributions in order to maximize the applicability of these findings. Our results suggest that a personalized approach for astronaut dosimetry may be valuable in determining the course of clinical action in the event of an SPE exposure.",Included
1926,"Measurement of visual evoked potential during and after periods of pulsed magnetic field exposure Purpose: To study the effect of switched magnetic fields used in MR scanners on the visual evoked potential (VEP) in human subjects. Material(s) and Method(s): We have used an MRI gradient coil, remote from an MRI magnet to produce a time-varying magnetic field (0.5 kHz, peak field ~8.7 T/second) in the human brain without the confounding effects of static field exposure or accompanying acoustic noise. The VEP response to a 2-Hz reversal, 8 x 8 checkerboard, occupying 20 degrees of the visual field was recorded from occipital locations O1 and O2. VEP recordings were made every five minutes before, during, and after a 10-minute magnetic field exposure period for seven subjects. Result(s): In contradiction to studies previously reported in the literature for fields of 50 Hz and 60 mT, no significant effects on the peak amplitude or latency of the VEP P100 O1 and O2 responses were found. Conclusion(s): Switched magnetic fields of a level and frequency comparable to those used in MRI do not have a significant effect on primary retinal or visual processing. © 2007 Wiley-Liss, Inc.",Excluded

1255,"Altered mechanical behavior of demineralized bone following therapeutic radiation Post-radiotherapy (RTx) bone fragility fractures are a late-onset complication occurring in bone within or underlying the radiation field. These fractures are difficult to predict, as patients do not present with local osteopenia. Using a murine hindlimb RTx model, we previously documented decreased mineralized bone strength and fracture toughness, but alterations in material properties of the organic bone matrix are largely unknown. In this study, 4 days of fractionated hindlimb irradiation (4 x 5 Gy) or Sham irradiation was administered in a mouse model (BALB/cJ, end points: 0, 4, 8, and 12 weeks, n = 15/group/end point). Following demineralization, the viscoelastic stress relaxation, and monotonic tensile mechanical properties of tibiae were determined. Irradiated tibiae demonstrated an immediate (day after last radiation fraction) and sustained (4, 8, 12 weeks) increase in stress relaxation compared to the Sham group, with a 4.4% decrease in equilibrium stress (p <.017). While tensile strength was not different between groups, irradiated tibiae had a lower elastic modulus (-5%, p =.027) and energy to failure (-12.2%, p =.012) with monotonic loading. Gel electrophoresis showed that therapeutic irradiation (4 x 5 Gy) does not result in collagen fragmentation, while irradiation at a common sterilization dose (25 kGy) extensively fragmented collagen. These results suggest that altered collagen mechanical behavior has a role in postirradiation bone fragility, but this can occur without detectable collagen fragmentation. Statement of Clinical Significance: Therapeutic irradiation alters bone organic matrix mechanics and which contribute to diminished fatigue strength, but this does not occur via collagen fragmentation.Copyright © 2020 Orthopaedic Research Society.

1956,"Electrical isolation of pulmonary veins in patients with atrial fibrillation: Reduction of fluoroscopy exposure and procedure duration by the use of a non-fluoroscopic navigation system (NavX) Aims: The aim of the study was to investigate the feasibility of performing segmental pulmonary vein (PV) isolation guided by the NavX (Endocardial Solutions, St Jude Medical, Inc., St Paul, MN, USA) system without the three-dimensional (3D) geometric reconstruction option and whether the use of NavX system will reduce the radiation exposure and procedure duration. Methods and Results: The study included 64 patients with symptomatic paroxysmal or permanent atrial fibrillation, in whom PV isolation was performed using fluoroscopic guidance (n=32) or the NavX system (n=32). Pulmonary vein mapping with a circular mapping catheter allowed the identification and localization of myocardial connections between the PV and the left atrium. PV isolation was performed by radiofrequency ablation of these connections at the atrial aspect of the PV ostium. Primary success rate for isolated PVs did not differ significantly in patients ablated under fluoroscopic guidance vs. those ablated under guidance of NavX system [100/107 PVs (93.5%) vs. 120/124 PV (96.8%; P=n.s.)]. Compared with fluoroscopy guided procedures, NavX-guided procedures showed a significant reduction in the fluoroscopy time (75.8+/-24.5 vs. 38.9+/-19.3 min, P<0.05), total X-ray exposure (93.2+/-51.6 vs. 56.6+/-37.9 Gy cm2, P=0.03), and total procedural time (237.7+/-65.4 vs. 188.6+/-62.7, P=0.01). The mean follow-up was 9.5+/-3.0 months. One patient in each group was lost to follow-up. Seven-day Holter monitoring showed that 23 of 31 patients (74.2%) in the NavX-guided group and 21 of 31 patients (67.7%) in the fluoroscopy-guided group were in sinus rhythm (P=0.57). Conclusion(s): The 3D visualization of the catheters by NavX system allows a rapid and precise visualization of the mapping and ablation catheters at the PV ostia and markedly reduces fluoroscopy time, total X-ray exposure, and procedural duration during PV isolation compared with ablation performed under fluoroscopy guidance. © 2006 Oxford University Press.",Excluded

METHOD(S): The experimental animals were whole-body exposed to microwave radiation with frequency of 2,450 MHz, power density of 1, 5, 15 mW/cm(2) respectively 1 h everyday for 30 days. Then the thymus were taken out after the mice were decapitated. Thymus index, morphological characteristics of thymus were examined. The changes of thymus T-cell subgroups, cell cycle progression in thymocytes and cellular apoptosis were detected with flow cytometry (FCM). RESULT(S): The body weights of animals in 5, 15 mW/cm(2) irradiation groups [(28.10 +/- 1.46), (27.50 +/- 2.52) g] were lower than that of the control [(31.95 +/- 2.51) g] (P < 0.05). Pathological observation showed dark red piece of nucleus, some nuclei inclined to one side, slight increase in hassall body. The expressions of CD8 in 5, 15 mW/cm(2) irradiation groups (29.14% +/- 1.68%, 29.18% +/- 0.81%) were higher than that in control group (26.95% +/- 1.27%) (P < 0.05). The percentages of G(2) + M phase thymocytes in both radiation groups (12.24% +/- 1.82%, 11.19% +/- 1.36%) were lower than that in control group (14.58% +/- 0.64%) (P < 0.01).

1728,"Comparison of two barium suspensions for dedicated small-bowel series OBJECTIVE. The in vivo radiographic features of two commercially available formulations of barium used as contrast media in dedicated small- bowel series were compared. SUBJECTS AND METHODS. Fifty-six consecutive outpatients referred for a dedicated small-bowel series were randomly administered either E-Z-Paque or Entrobar. Representative survey radiographs from each examination were randomized and reviewed by six gastrointestinal radiologists from three institutions. Each observer assigned a numeric score (1 = poor, 2 = fair, 3 = good, and 4 = excellent) that rated the quality of the radiograph with respect to these characteristics: definition of fold pattern, translucency, distention, and integrity of the barium column. Statistical analysis was performed for each characteristic using Wilcoxon's two-sample rank sum test. RESULTS. All six observers found a statistically significant difference between the two barium formulations for mean scores for definition of fold pattern and translucency. Mean scores for fold pattern were 3.3, 3.0, 3.2, 3.6, 3.3, and 3.4 for Entrobar and 2.1, 2.3, 2.4, 3.2, 2.6, and 2.7 for E-Z-Paque.

No statistically significant difference was found for mean score for distention or integrity of the barium column. CONCLUSION. On radiographs, Entrobar was found to have superior characteristics for visualization of fold pattern and translucency but offered no advantages for distention or integrity of the barium column. Improved translucency and definition of fold pattern may translate into improved sensitivity and confidence in diagnosing small-bowel abnormality.",Excluded

Patients, methods: Dynamic PET/CT-imaging (Biograph 16) was performed over 20 min in 14 patients (8 men, 6 women) after injection of (112 +/- 22) MBq 68Ga-DOTATOC followed by whole body 3D-acquisition (8 bed positions, 3 or 4 min each) 30 min p.i. and 120 min p.i.. Urinary tracer elimination was measured and blood activity was derived non-invasively from the blood pool of the heart. The relevant organs for dosimetry were spleen, kidneys, liver, adrenals, urinary bladder and pituitary gland. Dosimetry was performed using OLINDA/EXM 1.0 software and specific organ uptake was expressed as standardized uptake values (SUVs). Result(s): Rapid physiological uptake of the radiotracer could be demonstrated in liver, spleen and kidneys, adrenals and pituitary gland (mean SUVs were 6, 20, 16, 10, and 4, respectively). Radiotracer elimination was exclusively via urine (16% of injected dose within 2h); no redistribution could be observed. The spleen and the kidneys received the highest radiation exposure (0.24 mSv/MBq, 0.22 mSv/MBq resp.), mean effective dose yielded 0.023 mSv/MBq. Conclusion(s): 68Ga-DOTATOC is used extensively for diagnosis of somatostatin receptor positive tumours because it has several advantages over the 111In-labelled ligand. The derived dosimetric values are lower than first approximations from the biological data of OctreoScan.

Crews of three members each (male and female) participated in simulated planetary missions"" based upon a synthetic scenario task that required identification, collection, and analysis of geologic specimens with a range of grade values. The results of these preliminary studies showed clearly that cooperative and productive interactions were maintained between individually isolated and distributed individuals communicating and problem-solving effectively in a computer-generated ""planetary"" environment over extended time intervals without benefit of one another's physical presence. Studies on communication channel constraints confirmed the functional interchangeability between available modalities with the highest degree of interchangeability occurring between Audio and Text modes of communication.

2487,"Carcinogenic Interactions between a Single Inhalation of 239PuO2 and Chronic Exposure to Cigarette Smoke in Rats Rats were exposed once by inhalation to plutonium-239 dioxide ( 239PuO22), resulting in chronic alpha-particle irradiation of the lung, and exposed chronically to cigarette smoke to examine carcinogenic interactions between the two exposures. F344 rats were exposed to 239PuO22 to achieve an initial lung burden of 0.5 kBq and then exposed 6 h/day, 5 days/week to cigarette smoke at 100 or 250 mg particulate matter/m3 for up to 30 months. Exposure to cigarette smoke increased the cumulative radiation dose to lung by slowing the clearance of 239PuO2. 239PuO2 alone did not affect survival, but the higher cigarette smoke exposure shortened survival in females. Combined exposure to 239PuO2 and cigarette smoke acted synergistically to shorten survival in both genders. The combined effects of cigarette smoke and 239PuO2 were approximately additive for lung hyperplasia and adenomas but were strongly synergistic for carcinomas. Differences between observed incidences and incidences predicted by survival-adjusted models accounting for increased radiation dose revealed a substantial component of synergy for carcinomas above that attributable to the radiation dose effect. The synergy for malignant lung tumors is consistent with findings from uranium miners and nuclear weapons production workers. These results bolster confidence in the epidemiological findings and have implications for risk assessment. © 2010 by Radiation Research Society.",Excluded

2274,"Oral complications of head and neck radiotherapy: prevalence and management AIM: The aim of the study was to evaluate the short-term and long-term toxicity caused by radiation treatment in the head and neck with the technique of intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT)., METHODS: We selected 20 patients, 18 men and 2 women aged between 21 and 71 years, undergoing radiation therapy (IMRT) in head and neck. Patients were visited during radiotherapy and followed for six months after the end of the therapy. We assessed the presence of: mucositis, xerostomia, dysgeusia, dysphagia, pain, trismus and, in the case of late-onset complications, radiation cavities., RESULTS: Acute toxicity: in 20 patients, 18 reported mucositis, 19 xerostomia, 17, dysgeusia, 15 dysphagia, 18 had pain and 3 patients had trismus. Tardive toxicity: in 14 patients, 5 reported mucositis, 11 xerostomia, 6 dysgeusia, 2 dysphagia, 3 had pain, 4 trismus and in 4 patients were found radiation cavities., CONCLUSION: Acute complications with higher prevalence were xerostomia (19 of 20 patients), dysgeusia of 2nd grade (11 patients of 20), mucositis of 1st grade and pain of 1st grade (10 patients of 20). Among the late complications it was noted a maintenance of the high prevalence of xerostomia (11 patients of 14) and an increase in prevalence of trismus (4 patients of 14) against a reduction of all other complications.

A new iterative reconstruction algorithm (flash 3D) has been recently proposed for (SPECT). The aim of work was to evaluate radiation exposure to practitioners and patients by reliance on reconstructions methods that aid in reducing the injected dose Methods: Forty-eight patients (30 M, 18F) who were referred to our department forMPI were randomly selected and divided into 3 groups: Group (1): contained two sub-groups, one scanned with full administrated dose (25+/-3.2 mCi) and half dose (10 +/-2.5mci) Group (2): contained two sub-groups, one scanned with 32 projections per scan, the other with 16 projections per scan. Group (3): contained two sub-groups, one scanned at a time per projection of 20 s and the other scanned at 10 s per projection. The three groups were processed using 3D reconstruction algorithm(flash 3 D) (4 subsets, 13 iterations, FWHM=14 mm). Dose rate was recorded using a calibrated standard survey meter for all patients after dose administration. Besides, Dose calculations were also considered the time elapsed during staff exposure that included dose prepration, injection, patient imaging, and release times. Myocardial functional parameters such as Ejection Fraction (EF), End Diastole Volume (EDV), End Systole Volume (ESV) and Total Perfusion Defect (TPD) were compared for each group. Result(s): Qualitative assessments results from all groups showed which include (full dose (25+/-3.2mci) and half dose (10+/-2.5mci), one scanned with 32 projections per scan, the other with 16 projections per scan and a time per projection of 20 s and the other scanned at 10 s per projection Images were visually scored as very-good quality and sufficiently convergent and identical. Quantitative results using ( 3D) showed insignificant difference of the EF, EDV, ESV and TPD between the different groups. Dose rate reduced by 48%. when reducing to half dose (dose rate was 33+/-4.5 reduced to 14.8+/-3.6 along one meter from patient, also dose rate was reduced from 120+/-5.6 muSv/h to 67 +/-3.9.6 muSv/h in patients' rest room) for that reason the effective dose 15.2 +/- 2.4 was reduced to 7.1 +/- 1.8 when using half protocols with 3D . Conclusion(s): New 3D enable reduction of dose administration or total acquisition time plays a significant role in staff exposure. Further investigations can be performed to assess these results on large patients cohort with further dose reduction.",Excluded
969,"Treatment of haemorrhagic radiation-induced proctopathy using small volume topical formalin instillation BACKGROUND: Between 2 and 5% of patients undergoing pelvic radiotherapy develop chronic radiation proctopathy, occurring as a result of damage to the rectal mucosa during the treatment. Rectal bleeding of varying severity can occur as a consequence. There have been no formal trials of treatment for haemorrhagic radiation proctopathy and a variety of methods are currently used., AIM: In a retrospective study of 20 patients treated at a single centre, we assessed the efficacy of small volume topical formalin instillation to control bleeding from radiation proctopathy., METHOD: Patients were treated by a single operator using 20 mL of a 5% solution of formalin instilled into the rectum via a flexible sigmoidoscope for 3 min. Patients were followed up for an average of 22.7 months (range: 2-69)., RESULTS: A single session of formalin treatment was effective in 13 of 20 (65%) patients and a further four (20%) patients responded to a second treatment. No complications of the treatment was identified., CONCLUSION: Small volume formalin instillation therapy appears to be safe and effective in the context of haemorrhagic radiation proctopathy. The technique is simple, inexpensive, quick and requires no sedation. We suggest that it should be considered as a first line for patients presenting with this distressing condition.",Excluded
1464,"Kennedy Space Center Cardiovascular Disease Risk Reduction Program evaluation This program evaluation examined the Kennedy Space Center (KSC) Cardiovascular Disease (CVD) Risk Reduction Program which aims to identify CVD risk factors and reduce these risk factors through health education phone counseling. High risk participants (those having two or more elevated lipid values) are identified from monthly voluntary CVD screenings and counseled. Phone counseling consists of reviewing lab values with the participant, discussing dietary fat intake frequency using an intake questionnaire, and promoting the increase in exercise frequency. The participants are followed-up at two-months and five-months for relevant metrics including blood pressure, weight, body mass index (BMI), total cholesterol, high density lipoprotein (HDL) and low density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, triglycerides, dietary fat intake, and exercise frequency. Data for three years of the KSC CVD Program included 366 participants, average age of 49 years, 75% male, and 25% female. For those with complete two and five month follow-up data, significant baseline to two-month follow-up comparisons included decreases in systolic blood pressure (p = 0.03); diastolic blood pressure (p = 0.002); total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol and dietary fat intake (all three at p < 0.0001) as well as a significant increase in exercise frequency (p = 0.04). Significant baseline to five-month follow-up comparisons included decreases in triglycerides (p = 0.05); and total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol and dietary intake (all three at p < 0.0001). These program evaluation results indicate that providing brief phone health education counseling and information at the worksite to high risk CVD participants may impact CVD risk factors.",Excluded

The investigation included analyses of the frequency of lymphocytes at the early and late stages of apoptosis and necrosis of peripheral blood lymphocytes using the method of FITC Annexin V, lymphocyte counts at the stage of DNA fragmentation using the TUNEL method, and the number of CD95(+)-lymphocytes. In the capacity of additional tests, loading tests involving in vitro irradiation at the dose of 1 Gy of a suspension of lymphocytes and incubations for 5 and 24 hours were used. Activation of the initial apoptotic and necrotic death of peripheral blood lymphocytes was revealed in the persons chronically exposed to low-intensity radiation within the range from 0.01 to 4.23 Gy. Exposed patients demonstrated a decrease in the number of CD95(+)-cells as compared to unexposed patients. The results of the cell death studies in the persons residing in the Techa riverside villages testify indirectly to the genomic instability of the peripheral blood lymphocytes.",Excluded
174,"Profiles of non-cancer diseases in atomic bomb survivors This article summarizes the results of a recent study of atomic bomb radiation and non-cancer diseases in the AHS (Adult Health Study) population by the RERF (Radiation Effects Research Foundation) along with a general discussion of previous studies. The association of atomic bomb radiation and CVD was examined by incidence studies and prevalence studies of various endpoints of atherosclerosis, such as MI, stroke, aortic arch calcification, isolated systolic hypertension, and pulse wave velocity, and, although the excess was small, all endpoints indicated an increase of CVD in the heavily exposed group. Because of the consistency of the results, it is almost certain that CVD is higher among atomic bomb survivors. However, all CVD risk factors associated with lifestyle had not necessarily been adjusted for in studies to date, and it is difficult at present to conclude that the increase in CVD among survivors was a direct effect of radiation. Recent studies have demonstrated almost certainly that uterine myoma is more frequent among atomic bomb survivors. It cannot, at present, be concluded that uterine myoma is caused by radiation, because there are no reported studies of other exposed populations. Further analyses including the role of confounding factors as well as molecular approaches are needed to verify this radiation effect. The relationship between atomic bomb radiation exposure and hyperparathyroidism can now be said to have been established in view of the strong dose response, the agreement with results of studies of other populations, the high risk in the younger survivors, and the biological plausibility. Future studies by molecular approaches, etc., are needed to determine the pathogenic mechanism. Among other benign tumours, a dose response has been demonstrated for tumours of the thyroid, stomach and ovary. Although fewer studies have been conducted than for cancer, a clear association between radiation and various benign tumours is emerging. Concerning the association between atomic bomb radiation exposure and chronic liver diseases, the recent incidence study of members of the AHS population demonstrated a significant dose response. Both chronic hepatitis and cirrhosis were suggested as being associated with exposure. The possibility that the increased occurrence of chronic liver diseases among the survivors may be due to hepatitis virus infection cannot be excluded, and the results of the ongoing hepatitis C virus antibody titre studies are awaited.",Excluded
2267,"Outcomes of Radiotherapy for Osseous Echinococcosis of Meriones meridianus Background: Osseous cyst echinococcosis (CE) is an infectious disease that causes disability and deformity in patients, yet there is still no satisfactory treatment. Focusing on the feasibility and prognosis of radiotherapy as an adjuvant or palliative treatment for osseous CE, this study investigated the outcome of Meriones meridianus with osseous CE after radiotherapy., Methods: The study utilized a comparison control group design with three groups of gerbils, and 240 osseous CE gerbils were randomly divided into control, 40Gy/5times, and 50Gy/5times groups. Different doses of radiotherapy were given to the gerbils, and then, the effects of radiotherapy on gerbils and lesions were observed at 3 and 6 months after radiotherapy. Statistical analysis was done using chi 2 test, unpaired t-test, and one-way ANOVA., Results: Significant changes (P < 0.05) were achieved between the three groups in terms of seven parameters at 3 and 6 months, including the number of dead gerbils and lesion sites with ulceration and infection, number of dead scolices, protein content, Ca2+ concentration, the maximum diameter of lesion site, and wet weight of cysts. Except for the number of dead gerbils and lesion sites with ulceration and infection, all other parameters were observed a big difference between 3 months and 6 months in the 50Gy/5times group., Conclusion: Radiotherapy at a dose of 50 Gy has inhibitory and therapeutic effects on osseous CE in gerbils, and radiotherapy could probably be a treatment option for persistent or recurrent osseous CE.

72,"Effect of oral administration of Hypericum perforatum extract (St. John's wort) on skin erythema and pigmentation induced by UVB, UVA, visible light and solar simulated radiation Hypericin from St John's wort (Hypericum perforatum L.) is a photosensitizing agent that may cause a severe photodermatitis when higher amounts of St John's wort are ingested by animals. Although Hypericum extracts are widely used in the treatment of depressive disorders, only a little information on the photosensitizing capacity of St John's wort in humans is available. In the present prospective randomized study we investigated the effect of the Hypericum extract LI 160 on skin sensitivity to ultraviolet B (UVB), ultraviolet A (UVA), visible light (VIS) and solar simulated radiation (SIM). Seventy two volunteers of skin types II and III were included and were divided into six groups, each consisting of 12 volunteers. In the single-dose study the volunteers (n = 48) received 6 or 12 coated tablets (5400 or 10800 mug hypericin). In the steady-state study the volunteers (n = 24) received an initial dose of 6 tablets (5400 mug hypericin), and subsequently 3 x 1 tablets (2700 mug hypericin) per day for 7 days. Phototesting was performed on the volar forearms prior to medication and 6 h after the last administration of Hypericum extract. The erythema-index and melanin-index were evaluated photometrically using a mexameter. After both single-dose and steady-state administration, no significant influence on the erythema-index or melanin-index could be detected, with the exception of a marginal influence on UVB induced pigmentation (p = 0.0471) in the single-dose study. The results do not provide evidence for a phototoxic potential of the Hypericum extract LI 160 in humans when administered orally in typical clinical doses up to 1800 mg daily. This is in accordance with previous pharmacokinetics studies that found hypericin serum and skin levels after oral ingestion of Hypericum extract always to be lower than the assumed phototoxic hypericin threshold level of 1000 ng/mL.

1602,"Diagnostic performance of CT-guided percutaneous transthoracic core needle biopsy using low tube voltage (100 kVp): comparison with conventional tube voltage (120 kVp) Background: Computed tomography (CT)-guided percutaneous transthoracic core needle biopsy (PTNB) is typically performed at 120 kVp tube voltage. However, there is no study that has demonstrated diagnostic performance including ground-glass nodules and radiation dose reduction at lower tube voltage in large population. Purpose(s): To retrospectively compare the diagnostic performance and radiation dose between 100 kVp and 120 kVp during CT-guided PTNB. Material(s) and Method(s): This study included 393 PTNBs performed in 385 patients (Group I; 120 kVp) from March 2011 to September 2011 and 1368 PTNBs performed in 1318 patients (Group II; 100 kVp) from October 2011 to December 2013. The patients underwent CT-guided PTNB with the coaxial technique. Diagnostic performance, complication rate, and radiation dose were compared between two groups. Result(s): Technical success was achieved in 391 of 393 PTNBs (99.5%) in Group I and in 1344 of 1368 PTNBs (98.2%) in Group II (P = 0.09). The diagnostic accuracies for pulmonary lesions were not significantly different between two groups (97.1% [362/373] versus 96.2% [1202/1249], P = 0.458). Complication rate showed no significant differences between two groups in terms of pneumothorax (19.7% [77/391] versus 19.4% [261/1344], P = 0.904) and hemoptysis (2.3% [9/391] versus 3.2% [43/1344], P = 0.360). Among patients who developed pneumothorax, three patients (3.9%, 3/77) in Group I and eight patients (3.1%, 8/261) in Group II required treatment with drainage catheter. Nobody needed further treatment for hemoptysis in the two groups. The mean radiation dose was 1.5 +/- 1.9 mSv in Group I and 0.7 +/- 0.3 mSv in Group II (P < 0.001). Conclusion(s): The 100-kVp protocol for CT-guided PTNB showed significant benefit of radiation dose reduction while maintaining high diagnostic accuracy and safety.Copyright © 2017, © The Foundation Acta Radiologica 2017.",Excluded

The 10 lymphoma lines included 7 previously characterized and reported in the literature. Significant differences with respect to both latency period for tumor appearance and success rate for tumor transplantation were detected among the 3 experimental groups. The unmanipulated mice were poor recipients for lymphoma heterotranplants, and tumors were produced in only two instances. In contrast, 6 tumor lines were successfully transplanted in mice inoculated with ALS, and all 10 lines were successfully transplanted in X-irradiated recipients. Although tumors were readily produced in ALS-treated and X-irradiated mice, no gross or histologic evidence of focal or distant metastases was apparent. Human lymphoblastoid cells were recultured, essentially unchanged, from the heterotransplants from 6 of 7 tumors tested. Although the tumor line HT 1460, originally from a human lymphoma, was successfully transplanted in all 3 groups, only mouse cells were recultured. The use of X-irradiation, rather than ALS, to immunosuppress nude mice offers a more standardized method for heterotransplanting human tumor cell lines and permits ready comparisons between laboratories. Furthermore X-radiation permits transplantation and subsequent study of lymphoblastoid tumors that are otherwise difficult to successfully transplant in nude mice.",Included
2106,"Abdominal circumference but not the degree of lumbar flexion affects the accuracy of lumbar interspace identification by Tuffier's line palpation method: An observational study Background: Lumbar puncture for spinal or epidural anesthesia is commonly performed by palpating bony landmarks, but identification of the desired intervertebral level is often inaccurate. It is unclear whether such inaccuracy is related to patient factors, such as body mass index and degree of lumbar flexion. We hypothesized that overweight patients and patients with less of an ability to hyperflex their lumbar spines are prone to inaccurate lumbar spinous intervertebral level identification. Method(s): 52 adult volunteers were included in this study. 7 anesthesiologists with different years of experience identified and marked subjects' levels of the iliac crests, then marked the presumed interspaces. Lumbar X-ray was then performed with metal markers, and actual radiographic findings were identified and compared to the initial markings. Result(s): Patients with larger abdominal circumferences (mean (SD), 94.0(12.1) cm), higher body mass indices (25.9(3.9) kg/m), and aged between 50 and 70 years old had lumbar interspaces that were higher than the presumed level; patients with smaller abdominal circumferences (82.8(13.5) cm) and lower body mass indices (21.6(4.1) kg/m) had intervertebral levels that were lower than the presumed level. Cobb's angle, indicating the degree of lumbar flexion, did not affect the accuracy obtained. Conclusion(s): Patients' abdominal circumference, body mass index, and age are factors that may impact the accuracy of lumbar level identification. Tuffier's line, as identified by palpation, does not seem to be a reliable landmark for proper lumbar interspace identification in all cases.Copyright © Lin et al.",Excluded

Basic surgical construction techniques remain unchanged with mobilization and repositioning of the vessels followed by a sutured anastomosis. We used the Ellipsys device to construct percutaneous radiocephalic-arteriovenous fistulas at the wrist and report the results. Method(s): Data were reviewed retrospectively for all patients who had a percutaneous radiocephalic-arteriovenous fistula created during a 6-month period. Each individual underwent ultrasound vessel mapping in addition to physical examination. When a radiocephalic-arteriovenous fistula was feasible and a communicating vein 2 mm in diameter was noted in the distal forearm along with a radial artery 2 mm, a percutaneous radiocephalic-arteriovenous fistula was considered and reviewed with the patient. Result(s): Four individuals met the criteria to consider a percutaneous radiocephalic-arteriovenous fistula and all elected to have the procedure performed. Ages were 54-85 years. Three were diabetic and one was female. All percutaneous radiocephalic-arteriovenous fistulas were technically successful. Two individuals had not yet started dialysis therapy. Successful and repetitive cannulation for the two individuals with catheters was initiated at 4 and 8 weeks post procedure. The two pre-dialysis patients had physiologic arteriovenous fistula maturation (6 mm vein diameter and >500 mL/min flow) at 4 and 12 weeks. There were no procedural or late complications and none required intervention. Follow-up was 8-23 months (mean 16 months).

The purpose of this study was to compare the objective, subjective, and radiographic responses of patients with carpometacarpal joint osteoarthritis (CMCJ-OA) wearing a prefabricated neoprene splint (PFN), which crosses the CMCJ and metacarpophalangeal joint, with those of patients wearing a custom-made thermoplastic short opponens splint (CMT), which crosses only the CMCJ. Patients (N = 25) with first CMCJ stage I and II osteoarthritis were assigned randomly to wear either the PFN splint or the CMT splint for one week. After one week, the subjects rated their function in the splint and their satisfaction and pain levels on visual analogue scales. Pinch measurements were performed and x-rays were taken to assess carpometacarpal subluxation. The second splint was then applied for one week and all measures were repeated. The subjects rated the PFN splint significantly higher, and most reported that they would choose the PFN splint over the CMT splint for daily and long-term use. Both pain and function were improved with splinting, but the effect was amplified with the PFN splint compared with the CMT splint. Both splints reduced subluxation at the first carpometacarpal joint, but the CMT effect was greater. This study further supports current evidence that subjects with stage I and II first CMCJ-OA will have pain relief with thumb splinting. In addition, the PFN splint will provide greater relief when compared with the CMT splint. Furthermore, this study reveals that patients prefer the PFN splint to the CMT splint.",Excluded

Two radiologists independently reviewed each observation in 80 kVp CT and 80/Sn150 kVp CT. Modified line-density profile of the tumor and contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR) were measured. Diagnostic confidence, lesion conspicuity, and subjective image quality were calculated and compared between image sets. The effective dose and size-specific dose estimate (SSDE) were calculated in the image sets., RESULTS: Modified line-density profile analysis revealed higher attenuation differences between the tumor and normal tissue in 80 kVp CT than in 80/Sn150 kVp CT (127 vs. 107, P = 0.05). The 80 kVp CT showed increased CNR in the liver (8.0 vs. 7.6) and the aorta (18.9 vs. 16.3) than the 80/Sn150 kVp CT. The 80 kVp CT yielded higher enhancement of organs (4.9 +/- 0.2 vs. 4.7 +/- 0.4, P<0.001) and lesion conspicuity (4.9 +/- 0.3 vs. 4.8 +/- 0.5, P = 0.035) than the 80/Sn150 kVp CT; overall image quality and confidence index were comparable.

An inception cohort was defined which included 4,523 workers in employment between 1972-96 to examine cancer incidence. Cancer registrations in the inception cohort were identified to 1996 through electronic linkage of records with the NSW and the Australian national registers of cancer incidence. All-cancer incidence in workers at LHSTC was 15% below the NSW rates [SIR=0.85; 95% CI=(0.75, 0.95)]. Of 37 specific cancers and groups of cancers examined, statistically significant excesses relative to NSW rates were observed only for pleural cancer incidence [SIR=17.71; 95%=(7.96, 39.43)], and for incidence of cancer of the small intestine [SIR=4.34; 95% CI=(1.40, 13.46)]. This study gives little evidence of an increased risk of cancers associated with radiation exposure in a cohort of nuclear workers in Australia. The observed increase in the risk of cancer of the pleura was probably due to unmeasured exposures, given the lack of an established association with radiation exposure, and the strong link to asbestos exposure. Findings for cancers of the small intestine were based on small numbers and were likely to be due to chance.",Included

We think that 4D-CTA can further reduce the need for CA, sparing the patient the discomfort and risk associated with an invasive procedure.",Excluded
1224,"Ultrasmall WS2 Quantum Dots with Visible Fluorescence for Protection of Cells and Animal Models from Radiation-Induced Damages Two-dimensional WS2 materials have attracted wide attention in condensed physics and materials science due to its unique geometric and electronic structures. Particularly, WS2 shows extraordinary catalytic activities when its size decreases to ultrasmall, which provides potential opportunities for medical applications. In this work, WS2 quantum dots with strong catalytic properties were used for in vitro and in vivo protection from ionizing radiation induced cell damages. WS2 quantum dots possess unique optical properties of blue photoluminescence emission and excitation-wavelength dependent emission profiles. In vitro studies showed that cell viability can be considerably improved and cellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) can be removed by WS2 quantum dots. In vivo studies showed WS2 quantum dots can effectively protect the hematopoietic system and DNA from damages caused by high-energy radiation through removing whole-body excessive ROS. Furthermore, WS2 quantum dots showed nearly 80% renal clearance within 24 h post injection and did not cause any obvious toxicities in up to 30 days after treatment.Copyright © 2017 American Chemical Society.",Excluded
1851,"Increased carotid wall thickening after radiotherapy on the neck Patients treated for head and neck tumours with local radiotherapy (RT) on the neck harbour an increased risk of stroke. This may be due to accelerated atherosclerotic changes within the RT-field; however, the real impact of local RT on the carotid artery remains debatable. The aim of the present study was to assess the difference in carotid wall thickness (intima-media thickness) in 42 unilaterally irradiated parotid tumour patients by performing B-mode ultrasonography. A mean difference in intima-media thickness (IMT) of the irradiated compared with the non-irradiated carotid artery of 0.30 mm (P=0.031) was found. A significant correlation was established with a longer post-RT interval (P=0.008). RT on the neck is associated with increased thickening of carotid IMT. Screening and treatment of additional cerebrovascular risk factors which contribute to further IMT thickening and stroke development is recommended, especially in radiotherapy patients with a favourable prognosis.",Excluded
1377,"[The effect of proton pump inhibitor on healing of post-esophageal variceal ligation ulcers] BACKGROUND/AIMS: Esophageal variceal ligation (EVL) is the most preferable method for controlling variceal bleeding. However, EVL is associated with complications such as hemorrhage, chest pain, dysphagia, and odynophagia due to post-EVL ulcers in the esophageal mucosa. The aim of this study was to assess the effect of proton pump inhibitor (PPI), pantoprazole on the healing of post-EVL ulcers., METHODS: Forty seven patients were randomly allocated into PPI group and control group. Patients in PPI group received 40 mg of pantoprazole intravenously for 3 days after EVL, then 40 mg of oral pantoprazole for 11 days consecutively. Control patients received intravenous and oral placebo. Endoscopic examinations were performed twice at 7+/-2 days and 14+/-2 days after EVL respectively. Clinical outcomes include the size of ulcers, symptoms reported by patients; chest pain, dysphagia, and odynophagia., RESULTS: Forty seven patients completed the 7 days protocol (PPI/control; 25/22), and twenty six patients completed the 14 days protocol (PPI/control; 16/10). Post-EVL ulcers in PPI group were significantly smaller than those in control group (7 days; 98.7 mm2/119.4 m2, 14 days; 32.3 m2/43.8 m2, p<0.01). No difference was observed between two the groups with respect to summations of symptom scores (p> 0.05). Nineteen patients (PPI/control; 9/10) did not complete the 14 days protocol due to patients' refusal and adverse outcomes, such as hepatic failure and sepsis with bleeding from post-EVL ulcer occurred in two patients of control group., CONCLUSIONS: PPI treatment following EVL may be effective in healing post-EVL ulcer.",Excluded

3186,"Flat detector cone-beam CT-guided percutaneous needle biopsy of mediastinal lesions: preliminary experience PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the usefulness of flat detector cone-beam CT-guided CBCT percutaneous needle biopsy (PNB) of mediastinal lesions., METHODS: A total of 100 patients with 100 solid mediastinal lesions were retrospectively enrolled to undergo percutaneous needle biopsy (PNB) procedures. The mean diameter of lesions was 4.4 +/- 1.8 cm (range 1.8-9.0 cm). The needle path was carefully planned and calculated on the CBCT virtual navigation guidance system, which acquired 3D CT-like cross-sectional images. Diagnostic performance, procedure details, complication rate, and patient radiation exposure were investigated., RESULTS: The technical success rate of PNB under CBCT virtual navigation system was 100 % (100/100). The sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of PNB of small nodules under iGuide CBCT virtual navigation guidance were 95.1 % (79/83), 100 % (12/12), and 95.7 % (91/95), respectively. The number of biopsies and CBCT acquisitions were 2.6 +/- 1.2 (range 1-6) and 3.0 +/- 1.1 (range 2-8), respectively. Complications occurred in five (5.0 %) cases. The mean total procedure time was 11.70 +/- 3.44 min (range 6-27 min), resulting in a mean exposure dose of 9.7 +/- 4.3 mSv., CONCLUSION: Flat detector cone-beam CT-guided PNB is an accurate and safe diagnostic method for mediastinal lesions.",Excluded

2667,"Low-dose radiotherapy for lymphoid lesions of the orbit and ocular adnexa Purpose: There is no agreement within the radiation oncology and ophthalmic communities regarding the treatment of lymphoid lesions of the orbit and ocular adnexa. The authors report their experience with the use of low-dose radiation therapy for malignant and benign lymphoid masses of the orbital region in a series of 54 patients treated between 1985 and 1993. Method(s): All patients received 2 Gy per day for a total of 24 Gy, except when the lesion was extensive, in which case the therapy was 1.5 Gy per day for a total of 25.5 Gy. A diagnosis was established by incisional surgical biopsy in 26 patients and aspiration cytology in 28 patients. Those with a malignant or an indeterminate diagnosis were evaluated with a modified Ann Arbor staging system. Result(s): Low-dose radiation therapy produced a complete response in 100% of the orbital lymphoid lesions. This local control was maintained in 52 patients (96%) for the first year and in 51 patients (95%) for 5 or more years with a mean follow-up of 7 years. One patient died of causes unrelated to the malignant lymphoma after the first year of observation. The mean age of the 54 patients was 67 years, and the range was 37 to 90 years. The mean ages of presentation for each location were: orbit, 67 years; conjunctiva, 68 years; lacrimal gland, 66 years; and eyelids, 72 years. The female-to-male ratio was 1.25:1 (34 women and 20 men). In this series, 9 patients had benign processes, 38 patients had non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, and 7 patients had abnormalities of indeterminate cause. All histologic subtypes of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma involving the orbit responded equally well to therapy. Forty-five patients had clinically staged disease as follows: stage I, 21 patients; stage II, 4 patients; stage III, 2 patients; and stage IV, 18 patients. Benign disease, diagnosed in 9 patients, was not staged. Conclusion(s): Low-dose radiation therapy proved effective in treating lymphoid lesions of the orbital area. No treatment-limiting complications occurred. The only early side effects were mild xerophthalmia and chemosis in 50% of patients, and the only chronic side effect was mild xerophthalmia in 33% of patients. Cataracts, corneal ulcerations, and retinal injury were not observed.",Excluded
162,"Nonlinear interactions of high-frequency oscillations in the human somatosensory system OBJECTIVE: The source of somatosensory evoked high-frequency activity at about 600 Hz is still not completely clear. Hence, we aimed to study the influence of double stimulation on the human somatosensory system by analyzing both the low-frequency activity and the high-frequency oscillations (HFOs) at about 600 Hz., METHODS: We used median nerve stimulation at seven interstimuli intervals (ISIs) with a high time resolution between 2.4 and 4.8 ms to investigate the N15, N20 and superimposed HFOs. Simultaneously, the electroencephalogram and the magnetoencephalogram of 12 healthy participants were recorded. Subsequently, the source analysis of precortical and cortical dipoles was performed., RESULTS: The difference computations of precortical dipole activation curves showed in both the low- and high-frequency range a correlation between the ISI and the latency of the second stimulus response. The cortical low-frequency response showed a similar behavior. Contrarily, in the second response of cortical HFOs this latency shift could not be confirmed. We found amplitude fluctuations that were dependent on the ISI in the low-frequency activity and the HFOs. These nonlinear interactions occurred at ISIs, which differ by one full HFO period (1.6 ms)., CONCLUSIONS: Low-frequency activity and HFOs originate from different generators. Precortical and cortical HFOs are independently generated. The amplitude fluctuations dependent on ISI indicate nonlinear interference between successive stimuli., SIGNIFICANCE: Information processing in human somatosensory system includes nonlinearity.",Excluded
411,"Parkinson's disease: a test of the multifactorial etiologic hypothesis We studied the relative etiologic importance upon the development of Parkinson's disease (PD) of occupational exposure to herbicides and other compounds, ionizing radiation exposure, family history of PD and essential tremor, smoking, and history of various viral and other medical conditions. We identified patients (n = 130) with neurologist-confirmed idiopathic PD through contacts with Calgary general hospitals, long-term care facilities, neurologists, the Movement Disorder Clinic, and the Parkinson's Society of Southern Alberta, and selected two matched (by sex and age +/- 2.5 years) community controls for each case by random digit dialing. We obtained lifetime work, chemical, radiation, medical, and smoking exposure histories and family histories of PD and essential tremor by personal interviews, and analyzed the data using conditional logistic regression for matched sets. After controlling for potential confounding and interaction between the exposure variables, using multivariate statistical methods, having a family history of PD was the strongest predictor of PD risk, followed by head trauma and then occupational herbicide use. Cases and controls did not differ in their previous exposures to smoking or ionizing radiation; family history of essential tremor; work-related contact with aluminum, carbon monoxide, cyanide, manganese, mercury, or mineral oils; or history of arteriosclerosis, chicken pox, encephalitis, hypertension, hypotension, measles, mumps, rubella, or Spanish flu. These results support the hypothesis of a multifactorial etiology for PD, probably involving genetic, environmental, trauma, and possibly other factors.",Excluded
3099,"Safety and efficacy of a novel high-intensity focused electromagnetic technology device for noninvasive abdominal body shaping BACKGROUND: Thermal fat reduction technologies are leading the market for nonsurgical abdominal contouring. However, they are ideal principally for patients with fat bulges., OBJECTIVES: Our study investigates the effects of a novel nonthermal technology affecting the abdominal musculature and subcutaneous adipose tissue., MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 22 patients (avg. BMI 23.8 kg m-2 ) underwent 4 treatments on abdomen with high-intensity focused electromagnetic (HIFEM) field device. Treatments took 30 minutes and were spaced apart by 2-3 days. Photographs, weight, and waist measurements were taken at the baseline, after the last treatment, and at month 3 follow-up. Patient satisfaction was noted. Photographs were evaluated by blinded evaluators., RESULTS: The study protocol was completed by 19 patients. At month 3, the average waist size reduction was 4.37 +/- 2.63 cm (P < 0.01). The evaluators identified the before image from the 3-month image 89.47% of the time. About 91% of patients reported their abdominal appearance improved, and 92% stated they are satisfied with treatment results at month 3. No adverse events occurred., CONCLUSION: Observed waist size reduction and aesthetic improvement appear to be a combination of fat reduction and increased muscle definition of abdominal wall. In lower BMI patients, the increased abdominal muscle definition was largely responsible for the improvement. This novel energy device provides an additional tool for body contouring with primary application for lower and medium BMI patients.

1943,"Changes of hexose monophosphate pathway and methemoglobin reductase enzyme activity after radiation in guinea pigs HMP pathway activity changes occurring after exposure to ionizing radiation (LD50 dose) have been investigated. The study was carried out on 18 experimental guinea pigs subjected to 5 successive exposures of 150 rads 3 or 4 days apart. The control animals were sham radiated but were otherwise treated identically as those of the experimental groups. Blood samples were taken by cardiac puncture before radiation and 30 min after each exposure of 150 rads. The red cells were re-suspended in their own plasma and HMP pathway activity was measured in the suspension. The pathway activity showed a consistent but minor reduction in the experimental group, which became statistically significant after the total dose of 750 rads (P less than 0.020). In a separate study the changes induced by ionizing radiation in the erythrocyte enzyme NADH-methemoglobin reductase were measured using the same experimental protocol. The enzyme activity in the red cells of the experimental group varied between 34.90 +/- 2.17 to 161.95 +/- 5.34 I.U./ml erythrocyte pack. Its activity declined toward the initial value after reaching the peak by the 12th day of ionizing radiation with 600 rads (P less than 0.001).",Included

3633,"Outcome analysis of adjuvant chemoradiation after incomplete resection for pancreatic adenocarcinoma Purpose/Objective(s): To analyze the outcome of adjuvant chemoradiotherapy for patients with pancreatic adenocarcinoma who underwent incomplete resection, and to identify the prognostic factors for these patients. Materials/Methods: Data from 41 patients with pancreatic adenocarcinoma who underwent R1 or R2 resection followed by adjuvant chemoradiotherapy from January 1987 to March 2010 was collected. There were 27 men and 14 women, and the median age was 60 years (range, 40-84). The adjuvant radiotherapy (RT) was delivered to the tumor bed and regional lymph nodes. Radiation dose was less than 50 Gy for 22 patients and at least 50 Gy for 19 patients. The chemotherapy during radiotherapy was either 5-fluorouracil (n = 37) or capecitabine (n = 4). The median follow-up duration was 15.8 months (range 4.5 -53.4). Result(s): The median survival was 13.2 months and the 2-year overall survival (OS) was 17% ; the median time to failure was 7.5 months and 2-year progression free survival (PFS) rate was 9% ; the median time to distant metastasis was 9.2 months and the 2- year distant metastasis free survival (DMFS) rate was 27% ; the median time to locoregional failure was 10.8 months and the locoregional failure free survival (LRFFS) rate was 16%.

Nodal involvement (p = 0.053 for PFS, p = 0.029 for LRFFS), initial CA 19-9 (<=1000 U/mL vs .1000 U/mL, p = 0.029 for PFS,p=0.003 for LRFFS), post-operative CA 19-9 (p=0.03 for PFS,p= 0.035 for LRFFS) and post-RT CA 19-9 (p<0.001 for PFS and LRFFS) were statistically significant prognosticators for PFS and LRFFS. For DMFS, nodal involvement (p=0.054) and post-RT CA 19-9 (p<0.001) were significant prognosticators. On multivariate analysis, only post-RT CA 19-9 showed statistical significance for all outcomes. There was no difference in all outcomes between R1 resection and R2 resection. RT dose was not a significant prognostic factor for all outcomes. However, in a subgroup analysis of 21 patients who had pancreatic head cancer and underwent 3-dimensional conformal RT, lower radiation dose was related with inferior PFS and DMFS (p = 0.085 and p = 0.068, respectively). Conclusion(s): Patients with pancreatic cancer after incomplete resection have poor outcomes even after adjuvant chemoradiotherapy. Nodal involvement and CA 19-9 were prognostic factors, whereas increased radiation dose showed marginal significance.",Excluded
2700,"Variation in Body Shape across Species and Populations in a Radiation of Diaptomid Copepods Inter and intra-population variation in morphological traits, such as body size and shape, provides important insights into the ecological importance of individual natural populations. The radiation of Diaptomid species (~400 species) has apparently produced little morphological differentiation other than those in secondary sexual characteristics, suggesting sexual, rather than ecological, selection has driven speciation. This evolutionary history suggests that species, and conspecific populations, would be ecologically redundant but recent work found contrasting ecosystem effects among both species and populations. This study provides the first quantification of shape variation among species, populations, and/or sexes (beyond taxonomic illustrations and body size measurements) to gain insight into the ecological differentiation of Diaptomids. Here we quantify the shape of five Diaptomid species (family Diaptomidae) from four populations each, using morphometric landmarks on the prosome, urosome, and antennae. We partition morphological variation among species, populations, and sexes, and test for phenotype-by-environment correlations to reveal possible functional consequences of shape variation. We found that intraspecific variation was 18-35% as large as interspecific variation across all measured traits. Interspecific variation in body size and relative antennae length, the two traits showing significant sexual dimorphism, were correlated with lake size and geographic location suggesting some niche differentiation between species. Observed relationships between intraspecific morphological variation and the environment suggest that divergent selection in contrasting lakes might contribute to shape differences among local populations, but confirming this requires further analyses. Our results show that although Diaptomid species differ in their reproductive traits, they also differ in other morphological traits that might indicate ecological differences among species and populations. © 2013 Hausch et al.",Excluded
342,"Malignant melanoma risk by nativity, place of residence at diagnosis, and age at migration Although geographic latitude is clearly linked to the risk of cutaneous malignant melanoma, the chronology of this link is unclear. Based on the 4,611 cases of melanoma with known place of nativity diagnosed in 1972-82 among the non-Latino White residents of Los Angeles County (California, United States) of known place of origin, migrants to Los Angeles from higher US latitudes enjoy relative safety from skin melanoma. This relative safety is largely unaffected by the interval since migration, even after decades of residence in Los Angeles. The same relative protection is enjoyed by native residents of more northerly US communities in comparison with co-resident migrants from the southwestern US. While the observed effect of latitude is consistent with the accepted importance of solar radiation as a determinant of melanoma risk, it suggests that early, rather than late or cumulative, exposure is of most importance. This finding does not affirm the belief that protection of adult skin from exposure to the sun will reduce the risk from melanoma. It does suggest that decades must pass before it will be possible to assess the impact on melanoma risk of any increase in ultraviolet radiation delivered to the earth as a result of the destruction of atmospheric ozone.",Excluded
3705,"Alveolar hemorrhage (AH) in ANCA-associated vasculitis: Characteristics and prognostic factors in 65 patients AH can be a mild or a life-threatening sign of ANCA-associated vasculitis, but its prognostic impact and specific characteristics have not been determined. To do so, we retrospectively analyzed AH episodes that occurred, between 1991 and 2010, in patients with ANCA-associated vasculitis entered in the FVSG database. Patients and Methods: We selected confirmed AH cases, as assessed by the presence of hemoptysis and ground-glass images on X-rays or CT scans and/or bloody bronchoalveolar lavage fluid. Renal insufficiency was defined as creatininemia >150 mmol/l. Severity criteria were: hypoxia, Hb decline >1 g/dl over 48 h after AH occurred and requiring mechanical ventilation. Result(s): For the 65 cases (35 men and 30 women) analyzed, their mean age at the 1stAH episode was 53 years. ANCA-associated vasculitis diagnoses were: 55% Wegener's granulomatosis (WG), 34% microscopic polyangiitis (MPA) and 9% Churg-Strauss syndrome (CSS). Pre-AH hemoptysis occurred in 41 (63%) patients: 39% the week preceding, 29.3% 2-4 weeks before and 19.5% >1 month prior to AH diagnosis, which led to ANCA-associated vasculitis diagnosis for 45 (69.2%) patients. Among 10 (15.4%) patients (4 WG, 4 MPA, 2 CSS) requiring mechanical ventilation, 4 had hemoptysis previously. Twenty-three (35%) patients were hypoxic and 23 (35%) had major Hb decreases; 36 (55%) had concomitant renal insufficiency (pulmo-renal syndrome): 18 WG (51% of all WG) and 18 MPA (81% of all MPA). Paucimmune glomerulonephritis was seen in 31/33 kidney biopsies. Intriguingly, no CSS patient had renal impairment when AH occurred. Treatments included a combination of corticosteroids and intravenous cyclophosphamide (CYC) for 55 (85%) patients; oral CYC was used in 5, methotrexate in 4 and plasma exchange in 7. Rituximab and remicade were prescribed to 1 patient each. Mean time between AH and treatment onset was 5.87 (range 0-60) days. Mean follow-up was 8.3 years (range 1 month-19 years). Follow-up information was not available for 8 patients. A total of 38 (58%) patients relapsed: 7 with AH and other organ involvement, 21 with non-AH manifestation(s) and 10 with AH alone. Three patients underwent kidney transplantation. The 13 (20%) deaths (6 WG and 7 MPA) were attributed to: septic shock for 4, lung cancer for 2, and 1 each of the following: bladder cancer, AH, sudden death, hemorrhagic stroke, ARDS due to misplaced nasogastric tube and probably drug-related (methotrexate). Although 9/13 patients with pulmo-renal syndrome died, no death resulted directly from the initial AH. Conclusion(s): These findings highlight the importance of recognizing premonitory hemoptysis as an early sign of AH in ANCA-associated vasculitides, since 63% of the cohort patients had bloody sputum before AH was diagnosed. Also, patients with AH and renal insufficiency have poorer survival prognoses. As demonstrated by the five-factor score, AH alone is not predictive poor prognosis; conversely, kidney involvement dictates a poor outcome.",Excluded

The diets were either untreated (negative control diets) or irradiated at 1, 2.5 and 5 megarad and were freshly irradiated, or stored. The animals were fed their test diets for a period of 3 weeks prior to mating. Groups of mice given a single intraperitoneal injection of 200 mg cyclophosphamide per kg body weight served as the positive controls. Freshly irradiated PRD diet fed to male mice of both strains caused an increase in early deaths in females mated to the males in week 7 and to a lesser extent in week 4. The increase due to irradiation was small by comparison with that produced by the positive control compound. The responses for the other irradiated diets showed no significant increases in early deaths although some values for Oakes diet were high. The effect of storage was examined with PRD and BPN diet on one occasion and produced conflicting results. Thus there was some evidence that irradiated PRD diet has weak mutagenic activity in the meiotic and/or pre-meiotic phase of the spermatogenic cycle which appeared to be lessened on storage; the inclusion of such a diet in toxicological studies would therefore need to be carefully considered.",Excluded

24,"Assessment of periodontal changes in patients undergoing radiotherapy for head and neck malignancy: A hospital-based study Background: Surgical resection, radio and chemotherapy, either used singly or in combination, are the three most common modalities used in head and neck cancer treatment. These modalities are effective in eradicating the tumor; they also negatively impact the normal head and neck structures surrounding the tumor. Direct damage to the oral structures (soft and hard tissue) frequently occurs from radio and chemotherapy, and indirect damage may also arise from systemic toxicity. Material(s) and Method(s): This prospective study was designed to analyze the effect of radiotherapy on periodontal parameters in oncology patients prior to irradiation in the head and neck area, compared with 6 months following treatment. The statistical analysis was done using SPSS. Result(s): The study sample consisted of total 29 patients of head and neck malignancy (M = 17, F = 12), of mean age 45.66 years. Only 22% of patients had various habits (smoking, tobacco chewing, and alcohol consumption) and majority (27.59% patients) had tongue malignancy. All periodontal parameters-oral hygiene index Siller (OHIS), clinical attachment level (CAL), gingival recession (GR), except probing pocket depth (PPD)-were significantly increased after radiotherapy. When comparison was made between doses and fractions, only in mandible statistically significant difference were observed in GR. Conclusion(s): Although there was no significant change in PPD, there was increased GR, CAL, and plaque index associated with radiotherapy. In this study, 61.5% cases of mandibular teeth and 34.4% cases of maxillary teeth showed attachment loss greater than 0.2 mm. So, all patients with head and neck malignancy should undergo an oral examination before the initiation of cancer therapy with adequate prophylaxis.",Excluded
1071,"Urolithiasis and Frequent CT Scans: Does Chronic Pain Play a Role? INTRODUCTION: Urolithiasis is among the top 10 causes of Emergency Department (ED) visits in the United States. Approximately 50% of these patients undergo abdominopelvic CT scan, many more than once. We hypothesized that chronic pain conditions may contribute to frequent CT scans in patients who are evaluated in ED for urolithiasis., METHODS: A retrospective review of patients presenting to our tertiary care and the associated satellite EDs for urolithiasis, during the period 12/2012-05/2013, was performed. Patients with multiple ED visits and two or more abdominopelvic CT scans in any 6-month period were labeled as the frequent CT group. Control group consisted of similar patients who had no more than one CT scan in any 6-month period. Background information, number of CT scans for urolithiasis and other reasons, and the presence of chronic pain (established pain clinic visits, chronic pain medication, known chronic pain syndromes) were captured from charts. Wilcoxon rank-sum test and Fisher's exact test were used to compare variables. Multivariable logistic regression was performed to identify predictors associated with frequent CT scans., RESULTS: We identified 185 patients with frequent CTs and 139 patients in the control arm. Frequent CT scans were independently associated with chronic pain (odds ratio [OR]: 2.67, confidence interval [95% CI]: 1.55, 4.50), age (OR: 0.73, 95% CI: 0.60, 0.89), history of prior urolithiasis (OR: 2.15, 95% CI: 1.11, 4.15), and Medicaid insurance status (OR: 3.94, 95% CI: 1.66, 9.35)., CONCLUSION: Chronic pain is a significant contributing factor to frequent CT scans among patients presenting to ED with urolithiasis, leading to increased radiation exposure and healthcare costs.",Excluded
3264,"Non-inferior low-dose coronary computed tomography angiography image quality with knowledge-based iterative model reconstruction for overweight patients We investigated the feasibility of low-dose coronary computed tomography angiography (CCTA), using a prospective electrocardiogram (ECG)-triggered axial scan protocol, knowledge-based iterative model reconstruction (IMR), and fixed tube current, in overweight subjects. Forty non-overweight (group A; body-mass index [BMI] < 25 kg/m2) and 40 overweight individuals (group B; BMI = 25-30 kg/m2), who underwent CCTA for coronary artery disease screening, were retrospectively and consecutively enrolled. A 64-slice CT scanner was used at 100-kVp tube voltage and 150-mA tube current, and images were reconstructed using IMR techniques. Image noise, attenuation at the aorta, signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), and contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR) at the proximal right and left main coronary arteries (pRCA and LMCA) were calculated. CCTA images were qualitatively evaluated using a four-point scale (1, poor; 4, excellent) and analyzed using a non-inferiority test with a predefined non-inferiority margin of -0.2. The mean CCTA radiation dose (Group A: 1.33 +/- 0.02 mSv; Group B: 1.35 +/- 0.10 mSv; p = 0.151) and mean aortic root CT attenuation values (Group A: 447.9 +/- 81.6 HU; Group B: 439.5 +/- 63.6 HU; p = 0.571) did not differ significantly between the two groups. The mean noise in groups A and B was 26.0 +/- 4.8 HU and 29.2 +/- 4.4 HU, respectively (p = 0.005). The noise reduction ratio in the groups, compared to filtered back projection, was 65.0% and 68.1%, respectively. The mean grade of image quality did not differ significantly (3.75 +/- 0.04 vs. 3.71 +/- 0.04, p = 0.478). Group B CCTA image quality was non-inferior (mean difference = -0.043, 95% CI = -0.162-0.077) to that of Group A. We concluded that low-dose CCTA with prospective ECG-triggering and IMR might be applied to overweight subjects, as well as to normal-weight subjects, by using a fixed tube current without an increase in tube current based on the patient's body size.Copyright © 2018 Park et al.

1689,"Generation of a Transcriptional Radiation Exposure Signature in Human Blood Using Long-Read Nanopore Sequencing In the event of a large-scale event leading to acute ionizing radiation exposure, high-throughput methods would be required to assess individual dose estimates for triage purposes. Blood-based gene expression is a broad source of biomarkers of radiation exposure which have great potential for providing rapid dose estimates for a large population. Time is a crucial component in radiological emergencies and the shipment of blood samples to relevant laboratories presents a concern. In this study, we performed nanopore sequencing analysis to determine if the technology can be used to detect radiation-inducible genes in human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). The technology offers not only long-read sequencing but also a portable device which can overcome issues involving sample shipment, and provide faster results. For this goal, blood from nine healthy volunteers was 2 Gy ex vivo X irradiated. After PBMC isolation, irradiated samples were incubated along with the controls for 24 h at 37degreeC. RNA was extracted, poly(A)+ enriched and reverse-transcribed before sequencing. The data generated was analyzed using a Snakemake pipeline modified to handle paired samples. The sequencing analysis identified a radiation signature consisting of 46 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) which included 41 protein-coding genes, a long non-coding RNA and four pseudogenes, five of which have been identified as radiation-responsive transcripts for the first time. The genes in which transcriptional expression is most significantly modified after radiation exposure were APOBEC3H and FDXR, presenting a 25-and 28-fold change on average, respectively. These levels of transcriptional response were comparable to results we obtained by quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) analysis. In vivo exposure analyses showed a transcriptional radioresponse at 24 h postirradiation for both genes together with a strong dose-dependent response in blood irradiated ex vivo. Finally, extrapolating from the data we obtained, the minimum sequencing time required to detect an irradiated sample using APOBEC3H transcripts would be less than 3 min for a total of 50,000 reads. Future improvements, in sample processing and bioinformatic pipeline for specific radiation-responsive transcript identification, will allow the provision of a portable, rapid, real-time biodosimetry platform based on this new sequencing technology. In summary, our data show that nanopore sequencing can identify radiation-responsive genes and can also be used for identification of new transcripts.Copyright © 2020 by Radiation Research Society.

1449,"In vitro fertilization rate of mouse oocytes with spermatozoa from the F1 offspring of males irradiated with 1.0 Gy 137Cs gamma-rays Previous studies suggest that the spermatozoa from acutely irradiated male mice exhibit a reduced fertilization rate in vitro with the maximum decrease occurring for spermatozoa produced 6 weeks after irradiation (Y. Matsuda et al., Mutation Res. 142 (1985) 59-63). We have found that spermatozoa from unirradiated F1 males conceived 6 weeks after paternal F0 irradiation also exhibit a significantly reduced fertilization rate in vitro. After acute 137Cs gamma-irradiation yielding an absorbed dose of 1.0 Gy, adult CD1 F0 male mice were mated at weekly intervals with unirradiated female CD1 mice. Unirradiated adult males from F1 litters conceived 5 and 6 weeks after paternal F0 irradiation were allowed to mature. Their epididymal spermatozoa were evaluated for in vitro fertilization rates using oocytes from unirradiated 8-12-week-old CD1 females. The mean fertilization rate for spermatozoa from F1 males conceived 5 weeks after paternal F0 irradiation (80.74 +/- 15.74 SD %, n = 5) did not differ significantly from the control fertilization rate (89.40 +/- 10.94 SD %, n = 8). However, the fertilization rate for spermatozoa from F1 males conceived 6 weeks after paternal F0 irradiation (56.14 +/- 21.93 SD %, n = 5) was significantly less than the fertilization rate for control spermatozoa (p < 0.006) or for that of the F1 males conceived 5 weeks after paternal F0 irradiation (p < 0.04). These data suggest that spermatozoa obtained 6 weeks after paternal F0 irradiation can transmit a decrease in fertilization rate to the F1 generation males as well as exhibit decreased fertilization rate themselves when tested directly in vitro.",Excluded
1392,"Cell-free DNA levels and correlation to stage and outcome following treatment of locally advanced rectal cancer Accurate staging of rectal cancer remains essential for optimal patient selection for combined modality treatment, including radiotherapy, chemotherapy and surgery. We aimed at examining the correlation of cell free DNA with the pathologic stage and subsequent risk of recurrence for patients with locally advanced rectal cancer undergoing preoperative chemoradiation. We examined 75 patients with locally advanced rectal cancer receiving preoperative chemoradiation. Blood samples for translational use were drawn prior to rectal surgery. The level of cell free DNA was quantified by digital droplet PCR and expressed as copy number of beta 2 microglobulin. We found a median level of cell free DNA in the AJCC stages I-III of 3100, 8300, and 10,700 copies/mL respectively. For patients with 12 sampled lymph nodes or above, the median level of cell free DNA were 2400 copies/mL and 4400 copies/mL (p = 0.04) for node negative and node positive disease respectively. The median follow-up was 39 months and 11 recurrences were detected (15%). The median level for patients with recurrent disease was 13,000 copies/mL compared to 5200 copies/mL for non-recurrent patients (p = 0.08). We have demonstrated a correlation between the level of total cell free DNA and the pathologic stage and nodal involvement. Furthermore, we have found a trend towards a correlation with the risk of recurrence following resection of localized rectal cancer.Copyright © 2017, © The Author(s) 2017.",Excluded

1632,"Lung cancer detection with low-dose spiral computed tomography in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease patients PURPOSE: To determine whether low-dose spiral computed tomography (LDCT) can improve the lung cancer detection rate in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) subjects., MATERIAL AND METHODS: From October 1999 to December 2003, 374 COPD patients underwent LDCT for lung carcinoma screening. All subjects with an abnormal baseline CT scan were followed with serial CT scans as part of our protocol. Follow-up was continued until the demonstration of no change over a minimum of 24 months, or resolution. Sputum samples were also obtained for cytological analysis., RESULTS: On the baseline spiral CT scan, 132 of 374 patients (35.2%) had at least one non-calcified nodule that required periodic follow-up with CT scans. The median follow-up time was 21 months (range 2-48 months). Of the 374 COPD subjects, nine patients with primary lung cancer (2.4%) were detected: six were squamous cell carcinomas, two were small-cell lung carcinomas (SCLC), and one was adenosquamous carcinoma. Three of the nine tumors were in stage IA, two in stage IIB, two in stage IIIA, and two were limited SCLC. Potentially curative pulmonary resection was performed in four patients, pulmonary lobectomy in three, and wedge excision in one. One subject with stage IA squamous cell carcinoma received radiotherapy, as pulmonary function was severely impaired. In addition, four patients underwent removal of benign lesions. Sputum was collected in 205 (54.8%) of 374 patients. There were 154 (75 %) metaplasia, 14 (6%) moderate dysplasia, and one (0.4%) malignant case., CONCLUSION: LDCT increases early lung carcinoma detection rate in COPD patients, but pulmonary function impairment may reduce its benefit.",Excluded
3405,"The predictive role of abdominal fat parameters and stone density on swl outcomes Background: Our aim was to detect the role of radiological abdominal fat parameters by tomography and stone density by plain X-ray on extracorporeal Shock Wave Lithotripsy (SWL) stone-free rate. Method(s): The patients who had undergone SWL for a single opaque renal stone < 2 cm in diameter and proximal ureteric stone < 1 cm in diameter were collected retrospectively. The characteristics of patients and stones were recorded. The stone attitude, HU, abdominal fat parameters, para-perirenal fat area, perirenal infiltration and severity of hydronephrosis with pre-treatment NonContrast Computed Tomography (NCCT) and stone density with radiography were evaluated by a radiologist. Four weeks after the last SWL; all patients were evaluated by plain X-ray and categorized as Stone Free (SF) and Residual Fragment (RF) group. Result(s): 51 patients with renal stones and 88 patients with proximal ureteral stones were included in the study. 24 (47%) and 63 (71%) patients were classified as SFfor renal and ureteral stones respectively. Only stone size was an independent predictor for stone-free rates after SWL for renal and proximal ureteral stones on multivariate analysis. The Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curves for renal calculi revealed that creatinine level, stone size, stone attitude, Houns-Field Unit (HU) and Skin-to-Stone Distance (SSD) were the predictive factors for the SWL outcome (p< 0.05). The ROC curve for ureteral calculi demonstrated that HU, stone size and attitude were the predictive factors (p< 0.05). Conclusion(s): All abdominal fat parameters and the stone density were not related to SWL failure. A large follow-up with more patients is essential to confirm the role of radiological parameters on the outcome of SWL.Copyright © 2020 Bentham Science Publishers.",Excluded

Method(s): Totally 42 patients operated with SNM were selected in Renji Hospital, School of Medicine, Shanghai Jiaotong University from July 2016 to August 2017. The patients were randomly divided into control group (n=22) and experimental group (n=20) using random number table. The conventional cross-positioning technique under X-ray was used for puncture during SNM in the control group. While in the experimental group, the sacral CT and MRI images were fused for reconstruction and design of the navigation template, printed by 3D technique for the puncture in SNM. The times of punctures, the average time for puncture operation, the time of intraoperative testing of the stimulator device, the minimum onset voltage of the stimulator, the X-ray radiation dose, postoperative curative effect (rate of secondary transformation) and the incidence rate of complications were compared between the two methods using independent-simple t test or chi2 test. Result(s): Compared to control group, fewer times of punctures, shorter time needed for puncture operation, shorter time of intraoperative testing of the stimulator, smaller radiation dose and minimum effective voltage were found in the experimental group (P<0.05). There were 15 and 16 patients who completed the secondary transformation in the control group and experimental group, and there was no significant difference between the two groups (chi2=0.757, P=0.384). There were 3 cases of complications in the control group, including 2 cases of infection and 1 case of bleeding, while no complications in the experimental group.

2454,"Energy and thermal regulation during bed rest and spaceflight In planning for long-duration (1- to 2-yr) space missions (microgravity), the availability of oxygen, water, and food is critical for survival. If astronauts would consume approximately 3,100 kcal and 2.2 liters of fluid per day, the requirements for a 2-yr flight would be 2,263,000 kcal and 1,606 liters for each astronaut. These estimates, based on limited microgravity simulation and flight data, include 1 h/day of moderate isotonic exercise. Each 30-min/day reduction in exercise training time would save 110,869 kcal and 91 liters of water per year. One daily 5-h extravehicular sortie at an average work rate of 1.7 l/min would require an additional 529,250 kcal and 1,095 liters of water per year. Results from microgravity simulation (bed rest) experiments suggest that 1) there is uncertainty whether basal metabolism is unchanged, 2) submaximal ergometer exercise oxygen uptake appears to be unchanged or lower, and 3) without vigorous exercise training near peak levels, the peak oxygen uptake is definitely reduced. In addition, the equilibrium level of exercise core temperature is elevated excessively by approximately 0.5 degrees C after bed-rest acclimation. Changes in the efficiency of work or metabolism in any or all of these conditions could affect nutritional requirements for long spaceflights. Further research is necessary to elucidate the metabolic factors that would be changed and the energy cost of intra- and extravehicular activity during prolonged exposure to microgravity.",Excluded

1899,"Baseline MAPK signaling activity confers intrinsic radioresistance to KRAS-mutant colorectal carcinoma cells by rapid upregulation of heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein K (hnRNP K) Heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein K (hnRNP K) is overexpressed in malignant tumors and involved in DNA damage response upon ionizing radiation (IR). Here, we investigate its role in radioresistance of colorectal carcinoma (CRC) and evaluate a pharmacological approach to enhance CRC radiosensitivity via downregulation of hnRNP K. We show that hnRNP K is overexpressed in CRC tissue specimens and upregulated in response to IR in vitro, which occurs faster in KRAS-mutant CRC cells. HnRNP K knockdown impairs cell survival, cell cycle progression and KRAS-dependent radioresistance and increases apoptosis. Using the chicken chorioallantoic membrane assay, a decrease in xenograft tumor growth and radioresistance upon hnRNP K depletion could be verified in vivo, and comparable effects were achieved by suppression of hnRNP K expression using the MEK inhibitor MEK162 (Binimetinib). In summary, KRAS-mutant CRC shows intrinsic radioresistance along with rapid upregulation of hnRNP K in response to IR that can effectively be targeted by MEK inhibition. Our results point towards a possible use of MAPK pathway inhibitors to decrease radioresistance of KRAS-mutant CRC via downregulation of hnRNP K.Copyright © 2016 Elsevier Ireland Ltd",Excluded

3282,"Radiation- and Age-Associated Changes in Peripheral Blood Dendritic Cell Populations among Aging Atomic Bomb Survivors in Japan Previous immunological studies in atomic bomb survivors have suggested that radiation exposure leads to long-lasting changes, similar to immunological aging observed in T-cell-adaptive immunity. However, to our knowledge, late effects of radiation on dendritic cells (DCs), the key coordinators for activation and differentiation of T cells, have not yet been investigated in humans. In the current study, we hypothesized that numerical and functional decreases would be observed in relationship to radiation dose in circulating conventional DCs (cDCs) and plasmacytoid DCs (pDCs) among 229 Japanese A-bomb survivors. Overall, the evidence did not support this hypothesis, with no overall changes in DCs or functional changes observed with radiation dose. Multivariable regression analysis for radiation dose, age and gender effects revealed that total DC counts as well as subpopulation counts decreased in relationship to increasing age. Further analyses revealed that in women, absolute numbers of pDCs showed significant decreases with radiation dose. A hierarchical clustering analysis of gene expression profiles in DCs after Toll-like receptor stimulation in vitro identified two clusters of participants that differed in age-associated expression levels of genes involved in antigen presentation and cytokine/chemokine production in cDCs. These results suggest that DC counts decrease and expression levels of gene clusters change with age. More than 60 years after radiation exposure, we also observed changes in pDC counts associated with radiation, but only among women.",Included
1740,"Sunscreen protection against cis-urocanic acid production in human skin Commercial sunscreens may offer some protection from immunosuppression induced by ultraviolet (UV) radiation, but agreement concerning the degree of protection is lacking. Cis-urocanic acid, formed by the photoisomerization of transurocanic acid is considered an important mediator of the cutaneous immunomodulation resulting from exposure to UV radiation. We investigated the effect of sunscreens on the isomerization of urocanic acid in 17 human subjects. Two sunscreens containing chemical filters, sun protection factor (SPF) 4 and SPF 10, and a SPF 10 sunscreen with a physical filter were applied at a thickness of 2 mg/cm2. The effect of a thin layer (0.5 mg/cm2) of the chemical SPF 10 sunscreen was also evaluated, as the amount of sunscreen applied in practice may be considerably less than recommended. All areas were irradiated with a single UV dose of 3.6 SED (standard erythema doses). In irradiated unprotected skin the median net production of cis-urocanic acid was 52% (relative amount). In the sites treated with the chemical sunscreens, the production of cis-urocanic acid was 7.4% (SPF 4) and 3.5% (SPF 10), and isomerization was thus reduced more efficiently at a higher SPF (p<0.01). The physical sunscreen reduced the formation of cis-UCA to 15%, and was significantly less effective than both the chemical SPF 10 sunscreen (p<0.01) and the SPF 4 sunscreen (p<0.01). The production of cis-urocanic acid in the area treated with the thin layer of the chemical SPF 10 sunscreen was 22%. The protection against the production of cis-urocanic acid was therefore reduced significantly (p<0.01) when the sunscreen was applied in an amount lower than recommended.",Excluded

Result(s): A total of 566 patients were identified with 7275 total radiographic studies performed and a median cumulative effective dose of 16.9 (IQR 9.9-26.3) mSv. Multivariable linear regression analysis revealed computed tomography use was associated with increased cumulative dose, whereas increased age was associated with lower cumulative dose. Over 74% of patients received more than 10 mSv, with 7.4% receiving more than 40 mSv. Conclusion(s): The number of radiographic studies and overall cumulative effective dose in patients hospitalized for complex pleural space infection was high with the median cumulative effective dose > 5 times normal yearly exposure. Ionizing radiation and modern radiology techniques have revolutionized medical care, but are likely not without risk. Additional study is warranted to identify the frequency and imaging type needed during complex pleural space infection management, attempting to keep ionizing radiation exposure as low as reasonably possible.Copyright © 2021, The Author(s).",Excluded
638,"Dose-response study of intracoronary beta-radiation with 32P in balloon- and stent-injured coronary arteries in swine Purpose: A dose-response study was performed in swine to investigate the vascular effects of 32P over a broad range of doses in order to define the therapeutic window of intracoronary radiotherapy (ICR) with 32P. Methods and Materials: A total of 131 porcine arteries were subjected to balloon injury or stenting followed by 0-36 Gy of ICR from a centered 32P source wire to 1 mm beyond lumen surface or a sham ICR procedure. Animals were euthanized at 4 weeks, and vessels were harvested for histomorphometry. Result(s): In the balloon-injured arteries, doses of 7 and 9 Gy did not impact restenosis. At doses of 14-36 Gy, neointima was markedly reduced, with mild dilatation at the highest dose, 36 Gy. In the stent-injured arteries, the lowest dose of 9 Gy failed to reduce neointimal growth, while 14-26 Gy showed the most favorable response. Conclusion(s): ICR with 32P features a broad therapeutic window. Doses of 14-26 Gy to 1 mm beyond lumen surface provided an optimal combination of efficacy and safety. Doses of 7 and 9 Gy were generally ineffective, suggesting a minimum threshold for ICR with 32P to effectively inhibit restenosis. Copyright © 2002 Elsevier Science Inc.",Included

3015,"Effect of Rebamipide Ophthalmic Suspension on Intraocular Light Scattering for Dry Eye After Corneal Refractive Surgery PURPOSE: To assess the changes in intraocular scattering before and after instillation of rebamipide ophthalmic suspension in patients with dry eye after corneal refractive surgery., METHODS: This study enrolled 60 eyes of 30 dry eye patients undergoing corneal refractive surgery. Patients were randomly assigned to start topical administration of rebamipide ophthalmic suspension (rebamipide group) or artificial tears (control group) 4 times daily for 4 weeks. Tear secretion, tear break-up time (TBUT), and the fluorescein score were measured before and after treatment. Intraocular light scattering was also measured as the objective scattering index (OSI) at 0.5-second intervals over 10 seconds., RESULTS: In the rebamipide group, the Schirmer I test, TBUT, and fluorescein score improved significantly, from 11.4 +/- 9.0 mm, 2.2 +/- 0.7 seconds, and 4.3 +/- 1.3 to 14.9 +/- 7.4 mm, 4.5 +/- 1.7 seconds, and 1.9 +/- 1.0, respectively (P = 0.006, P < 0.001, P < 0.001, Wilcoxon signed rank test). We found significant improvements in OSI at 5.0 to 10.0 seconds after blinking (5-8 seconds, P = 0.01; 9 seconds, P = 0.02; 10 seconds, P < 0.001). The mean OSI, the OSI change rate, and the OSI slope of the linear regression line improved significantly, from 2.73 +/- 1.52, 74.7 +/- 69.5%, and 0.10 +/- 0.12 to 2.19 +/- 1.19, 28.6 +/- 48.7%, and 0.04 +/- 0.08, respectively (P = 0.02, 0.003, and 0.03)., CONCLUSIONS: Rebamipide ophthalmic suspension was effective for improving both ocular surface parameters and optical quality in patients with dry eye undergoing corneal refractive surgery, suggesting that it may hold promise for the treatment of such patients.",Excluded
2022,"Synthesis and application of a thermoplastic plate of poly(Lactide-epsilon-caprolactone) for radiation therapy In this study, the poly(lactide-epsilon-caprolactone) (P(LA-CL)) copolymer is synthesized by ring-opening polymerization with glycol used as a molecular weight regulator to adjust the molecular weight of the polymer. The proton nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy and gel permeation chromatography (GPC) results demonstrate that the P(LA-CL) copolymer is successfully synthesized, and that the molecular weight can be controlled by the glycol content. The thermoplastic plate is processed with triallyl isocyanurate as a cross-linking agent by a single-screw extruder followed by gamma-ray irradiation. Shape memory test results show that the material had the desired shape memory effect, with deformation recovery rates reaching 100%. After secondary stretching of samples, deformation recovery rates are unchanged. The results of mechanical property measurements indicate that with added lactide, the tensile strength is improved and shore hardness is increased by 20%-30%. Data from clinical trials also reveal that the material has good clinical effects in thermoplastic membrane fixation.Copyright © 2019 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.",Excluded
117,"Risk Factors for Keratinocyte Carcinoma in Recipients of Allogeneic Hematopoietic Cell Transplants Importance: Allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplant (alloHCT) is known to increase the risk for keratinocyte carcinoma. The extent to which host characteristics, including pigmentary phenotype and UV radiation exposure, contribute is unknown., Objective: To identify and validate independent risk factors for keratinocyte carcinoma after alloHCT, including those associated with the transplant and the host., Design, Setting, and Participants: This retrospective cohort study analyzed a consecutive sample of alloHCT recipients from January 1, 2000, to December 31, 2014, at the Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota (n = 872) and University Hospitals Cleveland Medical Center, Cleveland, Ohio (n = 147). Participants from the Mayo Clinic were randomly allocated (2:1) into discovery (n = 581) and validation (n = 291) cohorts. Time to first keratinocyte carcinoma and information about transplant- and host-associated risk factors were extracted. A multivariate keratinocyte carcinoma risk model was created using a stepwise Cox proportional hazards regression model with P <= .05 for entry that incorporated all covariates that were individually statistically significant at alpha = 0.05 in the discovery cohort. The risk model was first internally validated using the Mayo Clinic validation cohort and then externally validated using the independent cohort of alloHCT recipients at University Hospitals Cleveland Medical Center. Data were analyzed from March 13, 2018, to June 12, 2019., Exposures: Allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplant., Main Outcomes and Measures: The primary outcome was time to development of the first cutaneous keratinocyte carcinoma after alloHCT; secondary outcome, time to development of the first individual basal and/or squamous cell carcinoma after alloHCT., Results: Of the 872 alloHCT recipients identified in the Mayo Clinic cohort (520 men [59.6%]; mean [SD] age, 48.3 [12.6] years), 95 (10.9%) developed keratinocyte carcinoma after alloHCT during 5349 person-years of follow-up. Of the 147 alloHCT recipients in the exernal validation cohort (86 men [58.5%]; mean [SD] age, 47.9 [17.5] years), 18 (12.2%) developed keratinocyte carcinoma after alloHCT in 880 person-years of follow up. Risk factors independently associated with keratinocyte carcinoma after alloHCT included age (hazard ratio [HR] per 10 years, 1.72; 95% CI, 1.21-2.42), chronic lymphocytic leukemia (HR, 2.47; 95% CI, 1.20-5.09), clinically photodamaged skin (HR, 3.47; 95% CI, 1.87-6.41), and history of cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (HR, 2.60; 95% CI, 1.41-5.91). Harrell concordance statistics were 0.81 (95% CI, 0.72-0.90) and 0.86 (95% CI, 0.74-0.98) for internal and external validation of the keratinocyte carcinoma risk model, respectively., Conclusions and Relevance: This study found validated independent risk factors for keratinocyte carcinoma after alloHCT that are enriched with host- compared with transplant-associated risk factors. These findings highlight the importance of assessing host-associated risk factors for keratinocyte carcinoma in patients eligible for alloHCT. Future studies should examine whether keratinocyte carcinoma risk stratification before alloHCT may inform long-term surveillance strategies.",Excluded
2720,"Comparative evaluation of the in vitro micronucleus test and the comet assay for the detection of genotoxic effects of X-ray radiation The genotoxic effects of X-ray radiation on human lymphocytes were measured using the single cell gel electrophoresis (SCGE) assay (comet assay) and the cytokinesis-blocked micronucleus (CBMN) test; both were carried out in vitro on isolated human lymphocytes in order to compare the relationship and sensitivity of these two detecting methods. The radiation-doses were 0.00, 0.02, 0.05, 0.10, 0.25, 0.50, 1.00 and 2.00 Gy. In the comet assay, the average comet length (38.6+/-0.8 microm) of 0.05 Gy was significantly longer than that (29.4+/-1.1 microm) of 0 Gy (P<0.01), moreover, the average comet length increased with the dose of X-ray radiation. In the CBMN, both the average micronucleus rate (MN) and micronucleated cell rate (MNC) of 0.05 Gy were 11.5+/-4.5 per thousand, which showed no difference with that (7.5+/-0.5 per thousand) of 0 Gy (P>0.05). The lowest dose, which induced significant increase of average MN and MNC, was 0.25 Gy. The average MN and MNC rates increased with radiation-dose. The results showed that there was correlation between SCGE and CBMN, and the sensitivity of SCGE was significantly higher than that of CBMN.",Included
3100,"Interventional cardiologists and risk of radiation-induced cataract: results of a French multicenter observational study BACKGROUND: Interventional cardiologists (ICs) are exposed to X-rays and may be at risk to develop cataract earlier than common senile cataract. Excess risk of posterior subcapsular cataract, known as radiation-induced, was previously observed in samples of ICs from Malaysia, and Latin America. The O'CLOC study (Occupational Cataracts and Lens Opacities in interventional Cardiology) was performed to quantify the risk at the scale of France., METHODS: This cross-sectional multicenter study included an exposed group of ICs from different French centers and an unexposed control group of non-medical workers. Individual information was collected about cataract risk factors and past and present workload in catheterization laboratory. All participants had a clinical eye examination to classify the lens opacities (nuclear, cortical, or posterior subcapsular) with the international standard classification LOCS III., RESULTS: The study included 106 ICs (mean age = 51 +/- 7 years) and 99 unexposed control subjects (mean age = 50 +/- 7 years). The groups did not differ significantly in the prevalence of either nuclear or cortical lens opacities (61% vs. 69% and 23% vs. 29%, respectively). However, posterior subcapsular lens opacities, were significantly more frequent among ICs (17% vs. 5%, p=0.006), for an OR=3.9 [1.3-11.4]. The risk increased with duration of activity but no clear relationship with workload was observed. However, the risk appeared lower for regular users of protective lead glasses (OR=2.2 [0.4-12.8])., CONCLUSIONS: ICs, in France as elsewhere, are at high risk of posterior subcapsular cataracts. Use of protective equipment against X-rays, in particular lead glasses, is strongly recommended to limit this risk. Copyright © 2012 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.",Included
1848,"Work history and radioprotection practices in relation to cancer incidence and mortality in US radiologic technologists performing nuclear medicine procedures Introduction Technologists working in nuclear medicine (NM) are exposed to higher radiation doses than most other occupationally exposed populations. The aim of this study was to estimate the risk of cancer in NM technologists in relation to work history, procedures performed and radioprotection practices. Methods From the US Radiologic Technologists cohort study, 72 755 radiologic technologists who completed a 2003-2005 questionnaire were followed for cancer mortality through 31 December 2012 and for cancer incidence through completion of a questionnaire in 2012-2013. Multivariable-adjusted models were used to estimate HRs for total cancer incidence and mortality by history of ever performing NM procedures and frequency of performing specific diagnostic or therapeutic NM procedures and associated radiation protection measures by decade. Results During follow-up (mean=7.5 years), 960 incident cancers and 425 cancer deaths were reported among the 22 360 technologists who worked with NM procedures. We observed no increased risk of cancer incidence (HR 0.96, 95% CI 0.89 to 1.04) or death (HR 1.05, 95% CI 0.93 to 1.19) among workers who ever performed NM procedures. HRs for cancer incidence but not mortality were higher for technologists who began performing therapeutic procedures in 1960 and later compared with the 1950s. Frequency of performing diagnostic or therapeutic NM procedures and use of radioprotection measures were not consistently associated with cancer risk. No clear associations were observed for specific cancers, but results were based on small numbers. Conclusion Cancer incidence and mortality were not associated with NM work history practices, including greater frequency of procedures performed.Copyright © Article author(s) (or their employer(s) unless otherwise stated in the text of the article) 2018.

3699,"Radon awareness and mitigation in Vermont: a public health survey Radon exposure is associated with an increased incidence of lung cancer, and elevated levels may be found in as many as 1 out of 15 homes. The U.S. EPA recommends testing homes for radon and mitigating over the advisory level of 4 picocuries per liter (4 pCi L(-1), or 148 Bq m(-3)). A sample population from a list of Vermont residents who had tested their residence for radon through the Vermont Department of Health and who had elevated levels were mailed a survey to assess demographic characteristics, knowledge about radon, mitigation rates, types of mitigation, as well as barriers to mitigation. The response rate was 63%. Forty-three percent of respondents mitigated. Roughly half were not completely knowledgeable of radon based upon the ability to associate radon exposure with lung cancer risk. Reasons not to mitigate radon levels in homes were cost and lack of concern over elevated levels. A multivariate logistic regression analysis revealed factors associated with mitigating: an education level of college or higher (p = 0.02), concern that a high radon level would affect real estate value (p = 0.04), and home age less than 10 y (p = 0.05). In summary, less than half of Vermonters with elevated radon levels participating in the Department of Health program mitigated.

3018,"Positive psychological outcomes of spaceflight: an empirical study INTRODUCTION: Anecdotes from astronauts and cosmonauts suggest that spaceflight can be an enriching experience with enduring positive effects. These positive mental health effects may help protect flight crews from the psychological stress inherent in such high-risk missions. The goal of this study was to identify areas of personal growth likely to result from traveling in space and explore how they were patterned., METHODS: We developed a Positive Effects of Being in Space (PEBS) Questionnaire, which included a section adapted from the Post-Traumatic Growth Inventory (PTGI) as well as original items addressing experiences unique to spaceflight. We sent the anonymous questionnaire to 175 astronauts and cosmonauts who had flown on at least 1 mission; completed surveys were returned by 39 individuals., RESULTS: Every respondent had a positive reaction to being in space, the strongest of which related to the Earth's beauty and fragility. Respondents reported changes in both attitudes and behaviors. Respondents appeared to cluster into two groups based on the intensity of their reported changes. Response patterns did not vary by demographic group, number of missions flown, or total elapsed time in space., CONCLUSIONS: Overall, our findings support the idea that being in space is a meaningful experience that makes an enduring positive impression on astronauts and cosmonauts. An enhanced understanding of the salutogenic effects of space travel will contribute to the education, training, and support of future space crewmembers.",Excluded
2046,"Preservation of laryngeal functions in surgical treatment of pyriform sinus carcinoma Conclusion: The tumor's grade, rather than the tumor's location, was related to the opportunity of preserving laryngeal functions in patients with pyriform sinus cancer. The survival rate decreased significantly with the increase of tumor grade or node grade. Preservation of laryngeal functions is a safe and promising method without compromising the survival rate of patients with pyriform sinus cancer. Objective(s): Surgical resection of pyriform sinus carcinoma has a profound influence on the preservation of laryngeal functions. The purpose of this study was to assess the safety and efficacy of the surgical treatment of pyriform sinus carcinoma in the preservation of laryngeal functions without compromising the survival rate. Method(s): Two hundred and thirty patients with pyriform sinus cancer had been operated from March 1978 to December 2002. Of them, 158 cases had been operated with the preservation of laryngeal functions and 72 cases had been undergone total laryngectomy. In addition, 216 cases had received adjuvant postoperative radiotherapy. All cases were followed up for 6-12 months (mean 51 +/- 26) after surgery. The survival rate was calculated on the basis of Kaplan-Meier analysis, and the factors that influenced the survival rate of patients with and without preservation of laryngeal functions were analyzed with the log-rank test. Result(s): Laryngeal functions were preserved completely (speech, respiration, and deglutition) in 70.9% (112/158) cases, and partially (speech and deglutition) in 29.1% (46/158) cases. The 3- and 5-year survival rates were 75.4% and 59.0%, respectively, for the group with laryngeal function preservation, and 58.6% and 41.5%, respectively, for the group without preservation. There was no statistically significant difference in the survival rate between the two groups within the follow-up period (p > 0.05). Increase in the tumor grade resulted in a proportional decrease of patients with preservation of laryngeal function (p < 0.05). Increase in the tumor grade (p < 0.05) or node grade (p < 0.05) also led to significant decrease in the survival rate. The location of the primary lesions (the lateral wall or medial wall of the pyriform sinus) showed no significant influence on either the opportunity for preserving laryngeal functions (p > 0.05) or survival rate of patients (p > 0.05). © 2011 Informa Healthcare.",Excluded
2154,"Utility of positron emission tomography/computed tomography in extranodal natural killer/T-cell lymphoma Background: Natural killer (NK/) T-cell lymphoma, nasal type, is an aggressive form of extranodal lymphoma that is common in Asia, but rare in Europe and North America. Although NK/T-cell lymphoma involves upper aerodigestive sites such as the nasal cavity and nasopharynx, it frequently involves other extranodal sites, including the gastrointestinal tract, bone marrow, adrenal gland, and skin. Because of the frequency of extranodal site involvement, pretreatment evaluation of disease extension is important for staging and treatment. Recently, 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (18F-FDG) positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) was evaluated for its usefulness in the prognosis and treatment response of aggressive B-cell lymphoma and Hodgkin's lymphoma, and relevant results were obtained. Many studies have evaluated the value of PET/CT for various types of B-cell lymphomas, but other similar studies involving T-cell and NK-cell lymphomas are rare. In the present study, we compared the utility of PET/CT and conventional modalities, particularly CT, in extranodal NK/T-cell lymphoma. Patients and Method: From January 2006 to April 2010, 19 untreated patients with extranodal NK/T-cell lymphoma (11 males and 8 females; median age 61 years; range 13-90 years) were included in the study. PET/CT and conventional procedures (e.g., CTs and biopsies) were compared and evaluated for their abilities to detect tumor lesions and their influence in staging and treatment strategies. PET/CT was performed as an initial staging procedure. In addition to PET/CT, all patients underwent initial staging workups, including whole-body CT with contrast media, biopsies from the bone marrow and other sites, and panendoscopies of the upper aerodigestive tract. Patients were evaluated for clinical stage by both evaluation modalities (PET/CT and conventional modalities) according to the Ann Arbor Staging System, and treatment strategies were first planned based on staging results. Following PET/CT, the clinical stage was reevaluated in each patient, and treatment strategies were decided based on the re-staging results. Result(s): Seven patients (37%) had bone marrow involvement, eight (42%) were in Ann Arbor stage I-II, and 11 (58%) had a systemic dissemination. Most patients with systemic dissemination (9/11, 82%) had cutaneous lesions. The median number of disease sites was 4 (range, 1-15). The median number of positive lesions was 3 (range, 1-15) by PET/CT compared to 2 (range, 0-14) by CT (p = 0.12). Using PET/CT, 108 lesions (93%) were detected, and at least one FDG-avid lesion was observed at initial staging workups in all patients. In contrast, 70 lesions (60%) were detected by CT, and three patients (16%) did not show any positive lesion. Two lesions (2%) at the nasal cavity that were detected by biopsy were undetectable by either PET/CT or CT. The nodal and extranodal regions were separately evaluated by PET/CT and conventional modalities. In total, 28 nodal lesions were detected: all (100%) were positive by PET/CT and 26 (93%) by CT. Conversely, 89 extranodal lesions were detected, and 83 (93%) and 44 (49%) were positive by PET/CT and CT (p = 0.003), respectively. For the detection of upper aerodigestive lesions, PET/CT and CT demonstrated similar results: 23 lesions (92%) vs. 17 (68%), respectively. Notably, PET/CT was superior to CT in detecting cutaneous lesions [31 lesions (100%) vs. 19 lesions (61%), respectively; p = 0.026]. Bone marrow involvement was confirmed pathologically in only seven patients; four cases (57%) were positive by PET/CT and none by CT. Using conventional modalities, 11 patients (58%) were in the localized stage and eight (42%) were in the advanced stage. Using PET/CT, eight (42%) were in stage I-II and 11 (58%) were in stage III-IV. Most patients received chemotherapy plus local irradiation in stage I-II, and intensive chemotherapy with or without hematopoietic stem cell transplantation in stage III-IV. One patient did not receive treatment because of unwillingness for treatment and older age. PET/CT findin s altered the stage and treatment strategy in four (21%) and two cases (11%). Conclusion(s): In extranodal NK/T-cell lymphoma, PET/CT demonstrated a high detection rate for nodal and extranodal lesions, except in the bone marrow. PET/CT may have an impact on treatment strategy and is essential for risk-adapted treatment.",Excluded

1089,"Predictors and clinical significance of local recurrence in extremity soft tissue sarcoma Background. Limb salvage surgery (LSS) has gained widespread acceptance as the current treatment for treating extremity soft tissue sarcoma (STS) and has been greatly refined since its inception. Combined with improved adjuvant treatment modalities, rates of local relapse have greatly decreased. Nonetheless, local recurrence still occurs and identifying the cause and the subsequent effects of local recurrence can provide valuable insights as LSS continues to evolve. Methods. This retrospective study evaluated 278 patients treated for STS of the extremities between 2000 and 2006. Of these, 41 patients developed a local recurrence while 247 did not. Tumor characteristics and prognostic outcomes were analyzed. Wilcoxon rank sum test and either chi or Fisher's exact was used to compare variables. Kaplan Meier and Gray's test for cumulative risk were also performed. Results. Patients who had a positive margin were 3.76 times more likely to develop local recurrence when compared to those with negative margins. This corresponds to a 38% risk of local recurrence if the margins were positive after six years vs. 12% if the margins were negative. In patients who underwent a re-excision, the presence or absence of residual disease upon re-excision did not have any bearing on local recurrence (p =0.27). In comparing patients with and without local recurrence, there was no statistically significant difference in the rate and the proportion encountering distant metastasis and death due to sarcoma (p >0.05). Conclusions. Despite advancements in surgery, radiation and imaging, positive margins still occur, and the presence of positive margins following definitive treatment continues to remain as a strong predictor for local recurrence. While local recurrence represents a negative outcome for a patient, its impact on future prognosis is influenced by a variety of factors such as time to local recurrence as well as the tumor's inherent biological characteristics. © 2013 Informa Healthcare.",Excluded
588,"Validation of a decision instrument for selective chest imaging in blunt trauma IMPORTANCE Chest radiography (chest x-ray [CXR] and chest computed tomography [CT]) is the most common imaging in blunt trauma evaluation. Unnecessary trauma imaging leads to greater costs, emergency department time, and patient exposure to ionizing radiation. OBJECTIVE To validate our previously derived decision instrument (NEXUS Chest) for identification of blunt trauma patients with very low risk of thoracic injury seen on chest imaging (TICI).We hypothesized that NEXUS Chest would have high sensitivity (>98%) for the prediction of TICI and TICI with major clinical significance. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS From December 2009 to January 2012, we enrolled blunt trauma patients older than 14 years who received chest radiography in this prospective, observational, diagnostic decision instrument study at 9 US level I trauma centers. Prior to viewing radiographic results, physicians recorded the presence or absence of the NEXUS Chest 7 clinical criteria (age >60 years, rapid deceleration mechanism, chest pain, intoxication, abnormal alertness/mental status, distracting painful injury, and tenderness to chest wall palpation). MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Thoracic injury seen on chest imagingwas defined as pneumothorax, hemothorax, aortic or great vessel injury, 2 or more rib fractures, ruptured diaphragm, sternal fracture, and pulmonary contusion or laceration seen on radiographs. An expert panel generated an a priori classification of clinically major, minor, and insignificant TICIs according to associated management changes. RESULTS Of 9905 enrolled patients, 43.1%had a single CXR, 42.0% had CXR and chest CT, 6.7%had CXR and abdominal CT (without chest CT), 5.5%had multiple CXRs without CT, and 2.6%had chest CT alone in the emergency department. The most common trauma mechanisms were motorized vehicle crash (43.9%), fall (27.5%), pedestrian struck by motorized vehicle (10.7%), bicycle crash (6.3%), and struck by blunt object, fists, or kicked (5.8%). Thoracic injury seen on chest imaging was seen in 1478 (14.9%) patients with 363 (24.6%) of these having major clinical significance, 1079 (73.0%) minor clinical significance, and 36 (2.4%) no clinical significance. NEXUS Chest had a sensitivity of 98.8% (95%CI, 98.1%-99.3%), a negative predictive value of 98.5%(95%CI, 97.6%.6-99.1%), and a specificity of 13.3%(95%CI, 12.6%-14.1%) for TICI. The sensitivity and negative predictive value for TICI with clinically major injury were 99.7%(95%CI, 98.2%-100.0%) and 99.9% (95%CI, 99.4%-100.0%), respectively.

2112,"Optimum fractionation in X ray treatment of C3H mouse mammary tumours The doses required to control 50% of tumors at 150 days after irradiation were determined for eight fractionated X ray schedules. The tumors were first generation transplants from spontaneous mammary tumors in C3H/He mice. The schedules were: single doses, 5, 9 or 15 fractions given daily excluding weekends, and 2, 3, 5 or 9 fractions at the two day interval known to be optimal for reoxygenation in these tumors after a priming dose of 1,500 rads. For comparison, skin reactions on the feet of albino mice were determined, using the same fractionation schedules, in order to plot the tumor control probability (TCP) against skin reactions for corresponding schedules. Two optimum schedules were found which gave maximum local control of tumors for the lowest skin reaction: nine fractions in ten days (9F/10d) and 5F/9d. The treatments given in shorter overall times were fairly good if the two day intervals were used but were poor for 'daily' doses. Both schedules employing overall times of 18 days gave poor results. The results are discussed in relation to the time course of reoxygenation and cell proliferation. A substantial difference in TCD 50 was found between male and female mice, the females being easier to cure. (16 references.)",Excluded
2303,"Liver cancers in Mayak workers Liver cancer mortality risks were evaluated in 11,000 workers who started working at the 'Mayak' Production Association in 1948-1958 and who were exposed to both internally deposited plutonium and external gamma radiation. Comparisons with Russian liver cancer incidence rates indicate excess risk, especially among those with detectable plutonium body burdens and among female workers in the plutonium plant. Comparisons within the Mayak worker cohort which evaluate the role of plutonium body burden with adjustment for cumulative external dose indicate excess risk among workers with burdens estimated to exceed 7.4 kBq (relative risk = 17; 95% CI = 8.0-36) and among workers in the plutonium plant who did not have routine plutonium monitoring data based on urine measurements (relative risk = 2.8; 95% CI = 1.3-6.2). In addition, analyses treating the estimated plutonium body burden as a continuous variable indicate increasing risk with increasing burden (P < 0.001). Relative risks tended to be higher for females than for males, probably because of the lower baseline risk and the higher levels of plutonium measured in females. Because of limitations in current plutonium dosimetry, no attempt was made to quantify liver cancer risks from plutonium in terms of organ dose, and risk from external dose could not be reliably evaluated.

2805,"The association of primary tumor site with acute adverse event and efficacy of definitive chemoradiotherapy for cStage II/III esophageal cancer: an exploratory analysis of JCOG0909 Background: JCOG0909 is a phase II trial of definitive chemoradiotherapy including salvage treatment for cStage II-III thoracic esophageal cancer; the radiation field for elective regional lymph node irradiation, which can affect patient outcome and adverse event, varied based on the primary tumor site, i.e., upper (Ut), middle (Mt), and lower thoracic (Lt) esophagus. The impact of different primary sites on the safety and efficacy of definitive chemoradiotherapy in JCOG0909 is not well characterized. Method(s): Patients were categorized into three groups (Ut, Mt, and Lt) according to the primary tumor location. We compared acute adverse events during definitive chemoradiotherapy, complete response (CR) rate, 3-year progression-free survival (PFS), and overall survival (OS) among the 3 groups. Result(s): Out of the 96 patients enrolled in JCOG0909 between April 2010 and August 2014, 94 patients (16, 59, and 19 patients in the Ut, Mt, and Lt groups, respectively) were included in this exploratory analysis. The proportion of patients with cStage III was 25% in the Ut, 37% in the Mt, and 47% in the Lt group. Grade 3-4 leukopenia, neutropenia, and thrombocytopenia were more frequently observed in the Mt (66%, 54%, and 15%) and Lt groups (84%, 68%, and 16%) than in the Ut group (38%, 44%, and 0%). There was no significant between-group difference with respect to 3-year OS (73.3%, 77.9%, and 57.9%), 3-year PFS (60.0%, 59.3%, and 47.4%), or CR rate (62.5%, 62.7%, and 42.1%). Conclusion(s): In JCOG0909, the incidence of severe hematological toxicity had a trend toward higher in the Mt and Lt than the Ut esophageal cancer; however, no remarkable difference by primary sites was observed with respect to efficacy endpoints.Copyright © 2020, The Japan Esophageal Society.",Excluded
438,"Hippocampal avoidance with volumetric modulated arc therapy in melanoma brain metastases - the first Australian experience PURPOSE: Volumetric modulated arc therapy (VMAT) can deliver intensity modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) like dose distributions in a short time; this allows the expansion of IMRT treatments to palliative situations like brain metastases (BMs). VMAT can deliver whole brain radiotherapy (WBRT) with hippocampal avoidance and a simultaneous integrated boost (SIB) to achieve stereotactic radiotherapy (SRT) for BMs. This study is an audit of our experience in the treatment of brain metastases with VMAT in our institution., METHODS AND MATERIALS: Metastases were volumetrically contoured on fused diagnostic gadolinium enhanced T1 weighted MRI/planning CT images. Risk organs included hippocampus, optic nerve, optic chiasm, eye, and brain stem. The hippocampi were contoured manually as one paired organ with assistance from a neuroradiologist. WBRT and SIB were integrated into a single plan., RESULTS: Thirty patients with 73 BMs were treated between March 2010 and February 2012 with VMAT. Mean follow up time was 3.5 months. For 26 patients, BMs arose from primary melanoma and for the remaining four patients from non-small cell lung cancer (n= 2), primary breast cancer, and sarcoma. Mean age was 60 years. The male to female ratio was 2:1. Five patients were treated without hippocampal avoidance (HA) intent. The median WBRT dose was 31 Gy with a median SIB dose for BMs of 50 Gy, given over a median of 15 fractions. Mean values for BMs were as follows: GTV = 6.9 cc, PTV = 13.3 cc, conformity index = 8.6, homogeneity index = 1.06. Mean and maximum hippocampus dose was 20.4 Gy, and 32.4 Gy, respectively, in patients treated with HA intent. Mean VMAT treatment time from beam on to beam off for one fraction was 3.43 minutes, which compared to WBRT time of 1.3 minutes. Twenty out of 25 assessable lesions at the time of analysis were controlled. Treatment was well tolerated; grade 4 toxicity was reported in one patient. The median overall survival was 9.40 months, CONCLUSIONS: VMAT for BMs is feasible, safe and associated with a similar survival times and toxicities to conventional SRT+/-WBRT. The advantage of VMAT is that WBRT and SRT can be delivered at the same time on one machine.",Excluded
1482,"Imaging features of radiation-induced changes in the abdomen After external-beam radiation therapy, radiation-induced changes may be observed in abdominal and pelvic organs at imaging. In the liver, an area of low attenuation corresponding to the radiation port (or an area of hyperattenuation if the underlying liver tissue shows fatty change) can be seen at computed tomography (CT) performed within 3-6 months after therapy. Later, the liver may be fibrotic and contracted. In the stomach, small intestine, and colon, wall thickening and edema are early manifestations. Ulcers may also be observed. Long-term complications include strictures and fistulas. After irradiation of the kidneys, altered attenuation of the renal parenchyma may be seen at CT. Ureteral strictures, typically involving the distal ureter, may be observed after pelvic irradiation. The bladder may be small and contracted with a thickened wall after radiation exposure. Fistulas between the bladder and other pelvic organs sometimes occur. Typical musculoskeletal changes include growth abnormalities in skeletally immature patients, fatty replacement of bone marrow, and radiation osteitis.

711,"Detectability of radiation-induced changes in magnetic resonance biomarkers following stereotactic radiosurgery: A pilot study Our objective was to investigate direct voxel-wise relationship between dose and early MR biomarker changes both within and in the high-dose region surrounding brain metastases following stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS). Specifically, we examined the apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) from diffusion-weighted imaging and the contrast transfer coefficient (Ktrans) and volume of extracellular extravascular space (ve) derived from dynamic contrast-enhanced (DCE) MRI data. We investigated 29 brain metastases in 18 patients using 3 T MRI to collect imaging data at day 0, day 3 and day 20 following SRS. The ADC maps were generated by the scanner and Ktrans and ve maps were generated using in-house software for dynamic tracer-kinetic analysis. To enable spatially-correlated voxel-wise analysis, we developed a registration pipeline to register all ADC, Ktrans and ve maps to the planning MRI scan. To interrogate longitudinal changes, we computed absolute DELTAADC, DELTAKtrans and DELTAve for day 3 and 20 post-SRS relative to day 0. We performed a Kruskall-Wallice test on each biomarker between time points and investigated dose correlations within the gross tumour volume (GTV) and surrounding high dose region > 12 Gy via Spearman's rho. Only ve exhibited significant differences between day 0 and 20 (p < 0.005) and day 3 and 20 (p < 0.05) within the GTV following SRS. Strongest dose correlations were observed for ADC within the GTV (rho = 0.17 to 0.20) and weak correlations were observed for ADC and Ktrans in the surrounding > 12 Gy region. Both DELTAKtrans and DELTAve showed a trend with dose at day 20 within the GTV and > 12 Gy region (rho = -0.04 to -0.16). Weak dose-related decreases in Ktrans and ve within the GTV and high dose region at day 20 most likely reflect underlying vascular responses to radiation. Our study also provides a voxel-wise analysis schema for future MR biomarker studies with the goal of elucidating surrogates for radionecrosis.",Excluded
2214,"Segmental Differences in Radiation-Induced Alterations of Tight Junction-Related Proteins in Non-Human Primate Jejunum, Ileum and Colon Dysfunction of the intestinal epithelial barrier and leakage of luminal antigens and bacteria across the barrier have been linked to various human diseases. Intestinal permeability is regulated by intercellular structures, termed ""tight junction"" (Tj), which are disrupted after total-body irradiation (TBI). In this study, we investigated radiation-induced alterations in Tj-related proteins in the jejunum, ileum and colon of a non-human primate (NHP) model. NHPs were total-body irradiated with 6.7 and 7.4 Gy and intestines were procured at day 4, 7 and 12. Radiation exposure was found to induce significant increases in claudin-10 mRNA early (day 4) in all three gut segments and claudin-4 mRNA levels were repressed through day 12. TNF-alpha was highly induced in the jejunum and colon at early time points, but little induction was found in the ileum. Claudin-1 was induced only in the colon on day 4 postirradiation. Unlike the colon and jejunum, the ileum levels of claudin-7 were significantly downregulated through day 12 postirradiation. Western blot analysis revealed increased levels of claudin-2 on day 4 and of JAM-1 on day 7 postirradiation in all three gut segments. E-cadherin was downregulated on day 4 postirradiation in all segments, but remained reduced in the jejunum only until day 12. Taken together, these data suggest that exposure to radiation causes segment-specific alterations in the expression of Tj-related proteins. Interruption of Tjs may be a key factor contributing to injury to the intestinal mucosal barrier and increased intestinal permeability.",Included
1917,"Percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy for patients with craniocervical or thoracic irradiation Background: Radiotherapy with high local doses to the craniocervical or mediastinal region is commonly employed for a variety of oncological diagnoses. However, even with modern radiation techniques, treatment associated morbidity is a limiting factor, the most important being severe mucositis, dysphagia, nausea and consequently significant weight loss. Many patients require invasive procedures such as parenteral nutrition or the placement of a percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) to ensure sufficient calorie intake during and after the course of treatment. Patients and Methods: We have considered 71 patients who, from Jan 2014 until Oct 2015 and in association with their course of radiotherapy or chemoradiotherapy of the head, neck, or thoracic region, received a PEG via standard endoscopic or reverse (so called PEXACT) procedure. Diagnoses and accordingly therapy regimens varied: Patients receiving chemoradiotherapy (n=34), Cetuximab-based immune-radiotherapy (n=11) or definitive radiotherapy (n=7) for HNSCC were most common, followed by spinal bone metastases (n=6) and thoracic esophageal carcinoma (n=4) among others. HNSCC patients received a mean cumulative dose of 55,6 Gy (stdev=4,4Gy) to the cervical lymph nodes with involved regions being boosted up to a mean cumulative dose of 69,2 Gy (stdev=4,9Gy). Concomitant Chemotherapy was applied in the form of either a median of 4 weekly courses of Cisplatin or two courses of Carboplatin/5-FU in week 1 and 5 of radiotherapy. A median of 6 weekly courses of Cetuximab was applied. We retrospectively analyzed the development of patient body weight, BMI and general performance during radiotherapy. Result(s): Mean initial BMI was 23,5 (stdev=4,7). PEG placement was performed after a mean period of 18 days into radiotherapy. Mean cumulative dose applied up to that point was 32,6 Gy accounting for 50,7% of the overall dose. Median weight loss before PEG placement was 1 kg (range 0-9kg). 70% of patients (n=48) consequently were able to stabilize their body weight within a range of +/-2 kg, 23% (n=16) continued to lose weight (mean of 4kg), 7% (n=5) gained weight. PEG-related CTCAE grade 3 or higher complications, none fatal, were observed in 3 cases in the form of PEG dislocation and severe infection with subsequent surgical intervention. Mild local infection was observed in 6 cases and treated antibiotically without further complications. Conclusion(s): PEG is a valid and important supportive procedure to ensure sufficient calorie intake during the course of craniocervical or thoracic irradiation and can help avoid weight loss and consequently poor patient performance. The requirement of a PEG is generally associated with high doses applied to the mucosa of the upper GI-tract. It is crucial to determine valid prognostic factors for PEG-requirement in addition to the best timing of PEG placement during radiotherapy. Further clinical analyses are underway, for which this data will serve as basis.",Excluded
2277,"Radiosurgery for the treatment of spinal melanoma metastases BACKGROUND: The role of stereotactic radiosurgery in treating metastatic melanoma involving the spine has previously been limited. Conventional external beam radiotherapy lacks the precision to allow delivery of large single-fraction doses of radiation and simultaneously to limit the dose delivered to radiosensitive structures such as the spinal cord. This study evaluated the clinical efficacy of radiosurgery for the treatment of melanoma spinal metastases in 28 patients., METHODS: Thirty-six melanoma spine metastases were treated with a single-session radiosurgery technique (1 cervical, 11 thoracic, 13 lumbar, and 11 sacral) with a follow-up period of 3-43 months (median 13 months). Tumor volume ranged from 4.1 to 153 cm3 (mean 47.6 cm3). Twenty-three of the 36 lesions had received prior external beam irradiation., RESULTS: Maximum tumor dose was maintained at 17.5-25 Gy (mean 21.7 Gy). Spinal cord volume receiving > 8 Gy ranged from 0.0 to 0.7 cm3 (mean 0.26 cm3); spinal canal volume at the cauda equina level receiving > 8 Gy ranged from 0.0 to 3.5 cm3 (mean 0.98 cm3). No radiation-induced toxicity occurred during the follow-up period. Axial and radicular pain improved in 27 of 28 patients (96%) who were treated primarily for pain. Long-term tumor control was seen in 3 of 4 cases treated primarily for radiographic tumor progression. Two patients went on to require open surgical intervention for tumor progression resulting in neurological deficit., CONCLUSIONS: Spinal radiosurgery offers a therapeutic modality for the safe delivery of large dose fractions of radiation therapy in a single fraction for the management of spinal metastases in patients with advanced melanoma that are often poorly controlled with alternative conventional external beam radiation therapy, and is successful even in patients with previously irradiated lesions.

1073,"Mesenchymal stem cell therapy for cutaneous radiation syndrome Systemic and local radiation injuries caused by nuclear power reactor accidents, therapeutic irradiation, or nuclear terrorism should be prevented or properly treated in order to improve wound management and save lives. Currently, regenerative surgical modalities should be attempted with temporal artificial dermis impregnated and sprayed with a local angiogenic factor such as basic fibroblast growth factor, and secondary reconstruction can be a candidate for demarcation and saving the donor morbidity. Human mesenchymal stem cells and adipose-derived stem cells, together with angiogenic and mitogenic factor of basic fibroblast growth factor and an artificial dermis, were applied over the excised irradiated skin defect and were tested for differentiation and local stimulation effects in the radiation-exposed wounds. The perforator flap and artificial dermal template with growth factor were successful for reconstruction in patients who were suffering from complex underlying disease. Patients were uneventfully treated with minimal morbidities. In the experiments, the hMSCs are strongly proliferative even after 20 Gy irradiation in vitro. In vivo, 4 Gy rat whole body irradiation demonstrated that sustained marrow stromal (mesenchymal stem) cells survived in the bone marrow. Immediate artificial dermis application impregnated with cells and the cytokine over the 20 Gy irradiated skin and soft tissues demonstrated the significantly improved fat angiogenesis, architected dermal reconstitution, and less inflammatory epidermal recovery. Detailed understanding of underlying diseases and rational reconstructive procedures brings about good outcomes for difficult irradiated wound healing. Adipose-derived stem cells are also implicated in the limited local injuries for short cell harvesting and processing time in the same subject. Copyright © 2010 Health Physics Society.",Included

Patients with locally advanced rectal cancer enrolled between 1997 and 2008 in an observational study of preoperative SC-RT were analysed. The treatment algorithm was neo-adjuvant chemotherapy (CT) administered for four cycles, followed by preoperative SC-RT administered 1 week after chemotherapy completion, delivering 20 Gy in five fractions over 1 week. Immediately in the following week surgery was performed. The adjuvant 5-FU-based CT was planned for pathological stage UICC>=II. LC, overall survival (OS), disease-free survival (DFS), early and late complications (RTOG scale) were analysed. All patients completed the EORTC QoL (C-30 and C-38), Faecal Incontinence QoL, and International Index of Erectile Function questionnaires (IIEF). A total of 67 patients were analysed. Chemotherapy and radiotherapy were well tolerated. At the pathological analysis, stable disease was obtained in 24 patients (36%), reduction of disease stage in 34 patients (50.7%), and progression in nine cases (13.3%). Adjuvant chemotherapy was indicated in 21 patients. Two locoregional recurrences, both within the radiotherapy volume, were observed, resulting in a 5-year LC of 97%. The 5-year DFS was 84%, with mean time to systemic progression of 24 months. After a mean follow-up of 114 months, the 5-year OS rate was 67%. Late toxicity >grade II was observed in 9% of patients. High anterior resection (AR) patients had significantly better scores than low AR or abdomino-perineal resection (APR). A total of 89% of the patients treated with conservative surgery had regular anal sphincter function. In male patients undergoing AR or APR, erectile dysfunction was found in 47% and 75% of the cases, respectively.

METHOD(S): Ninety-three potential liver donors who underwent preoperative contrast-enhanced 64 multidetector CTA and CTC were retrospectively divided into 2 groups: at 80 and at 120 kVp. An institutional review board waiver was obtained. Signal-to-noise ratio and contrast-to-noise ratio of the hepatic artery and common bile duct were obtained. The dose-length product was recorded. Image quality and visibility of hepatic artery and biliary tract anatomy were evaluated. Mann-Whitney U test was used for statistical evaluation. RESULT(S): Mean hepatic artery/common bile duct signal-to-noise ratio was 28.9/28.6 (SD, 14.2/10.0) at 80 kVp and 27.6/25.8 (SD, 8.0/6.2) at 120 kVp (P = 0.61/0.099). Mean hepatic artery/common bile duct contrast-to-noise ratio was 24.8/23.3 (SD, 12.9/8.6) at 80 kVp and 22.2/19.3 (SD, 7.7/5.0) at 120 kVp (P = 0.76/0.005). Mean CTA/CTC dose-length product was 279/281 (SD, 42/52) mGy-cm at 80 kVp and 407/451 (SD, 208/243) mGy-cm at 120 kVp (P = 0.026/0.002).

3035,"Radioprotective effects of exogenous glutathione against whole-body gamma-ray irradiation: age- and gender-related changes in malondialdehyde levels, superoxide dismutase and catalase activities in rat liver Age- and gender-related changes in malondialdehyde (MDA) levels, superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase (CAT) activities in rat livers exposed to different doses of whole-body gamma-ray radiation were determined. In addition, the effects of exogenous glutathione (GSH) against radiation injury in rat livers were investigated. We found that MDA levels have an age-associated increment and an increasing radiation dose-related elevation, although they decrease slightly in the 4 Gy group. The MDA levels in old rats were lower in males than in females, while those of young rats did not change. There were no observed age-related changes in SOD activities, although male rats had higher SOD activity than females. Female rats had the highest CAT activities in the 4 Gy group, while male rats had the highest CAT activities in the 6 Gy group. CAT activities in the 8 Gy group were lower than those of the 2 Gy group for each gender and age. While MDA levels were decreased and CAT activities increased by GSH, SOD activities remained unchanged. The results indicate that gamma-ray radiation affects gender- and age-dependent MDA levels, SOD and CAT activities. Administration of GSH appears to be a useful approach to reduce radiation injury by reducing MDA levels and increasing CAT activities.",Included

Results were stratified on the basis of self-reported occupational exposure to procedures that involve radiation., RESULTS: There were 1,543 employees (mean age 43 +/- 11.3 years, 33% male) who responded to the survey (response rate of 57%), and 1,042 (67.5%) reported being involved with procedures utilizing radiation. These employees reported experiencing work-related pain more often than the control group before (54.7% vs. 44.7%; p < 0.001) and after adjustment for age, sex, body mass index, pre-existing musculoskeletal conditions, years in profession, and job description (odds ratio: 1.67; 95% confidence interval: 1.32 to 2.11; p < 0.001). Musculoskeletal pain varied significantly by job description, with the highest incidence reported by technicians (62%) and nurses (60%) followed by attending physicians (44%) and trainees (19%; p < 0.001). There was no difference in cancer prevalence between groups (9% vs. 9%; p = 0.96)., CONCLUSIONS: Musculoskeletal pain is more common among healthcare workers who participate in interventional procedures and is highest in nonphysician employees. The diagnosis of cancer in employees who participate in procedures that utilize radiation was not elevated when compared to controls within the same departments, although any conclusion regarding causality is limited by the cross-sectional nature of the study, as well as the low overall prevalence of malignancy in our study group.

2547,"Use of irradiated bone graft for impaction grafting in acetabular revision surgery: a review of fifty consecutive cases Impaction bone grafting is a useful technique in the armament of a revision hip surgeon. Traditionally fresh frozen allograft has been used for this technique. However there are concerns about the transmission of viral proteins and prions through this form of allograft. As a result irradiated bone graft has been favoured in some centres. There is no long term series describing the results of impaction bone grafting using irradiated bone. This paper reviews a consecutive series of 50 cases of acetabular revision surgery performed between 1995 and 2001 and followed up over a mean period of 45 months. The preoperative bone defect was graded by the Paprosky classification. There were 2 cases of type 1a, 9 type 2a, 15 type 2b, 7 type 2c, 10 type 3a and 7 type 3b. All cases were followed up clinically and radiologically. Case notes were reviewed for primary prosthesis, operative details and reason for revision. The radiographs were evaluated for signs of bone incorporation, remodelling, loosening and migration of the acetabular component. There were 5 cases of aseptic loosening at the end of the follow up period. One patient had recurrent dislocation and was revised. 20 cases (40%) showed changes suggestive of bone incorporation, while only 3 cases (6%) showed remodelling. Clinically a good or excellent outcome with absence of pain was achieved in 35 patients (70%). The results suggested that acetabular impaction bone grafting using irradiated bone graft is comparable to fresh frozen allograft. The low percentage of remodelling remains a concern and warrants further studies.",Excluded

645,"Dna damage and repair: Fruit and vegetable effects in a feeding trial Epidemiologic studies have examined the association between fruit and vegetable (F&V) consumption and the risk of cancer. Several cancer-preventive mechanisms have been proposed, such as antioxidant properties and modulation of biotransformation enzyme activities; both may be associated with reducing DNA damage and hence the mutation rate. We investigated, in a randomized, controlled, crossover feeding trial, the effect of 10 servings/day of botanically defined F&V for 2 wk on endogenous DNA damage; resistance to gamma-irradiation damage; and DNA repair capacity in lymphocytes, measured by the Comet assay. We also explored the association between the UGT1A1*28 polymorphism and serum bilirubin concentrations and DNA damage and repair measures. Healthy men (n = 11) and women (n = 17), age 20 to 40 yr, provided blood samples at the end of each feeding period. Overall, F&V did not affect DNA damage and repair measures in lymphocytes. The number of UGT1A1*28 alleles was inversely associated with sensitivity to gamma-irradiation exposure and DNA repair capacity, but a biological mechanism to explain this association is unclear. A larger sample size is needed to investigate the association between bilirubin concentrations and endogenous DNA damage. With inconsistent findings in the literature, additional dietary intervention studies on the effect of F&V on DNA damage and repair are needed.

3195,"Flow cytometry-based assay for determination of teleost cytotoxic cell lysis of target cells BACKGROUND: The nonradiometric assays previously developed to detect cellular cytotoxic activity have been hindered by many difficulties. Among the problems are the requirement for expensive commercial kits and the use of techniques that produce high background noise and decreased sensitivity. In addition, these assays did not account for bidirectional apoptosis (activation-induced cell death [AICD]). Most attempts to derive cytometry-based cytotoxicity assays have been unsuccessful because individual effectors and targets could not be identified (i.e., ""separated"") using gating techniques., METHODS: In the present study, teleost nonspecific cytotoxic (NCC) and mammalian target cells were each sufficiently different in size to identify them by flow cytometry (FCM). Using appropriate gating and discriminator techniques, these two cell populations were differentiated based on scatter properties and propidium iodide (PI) binding. Total capacity for PI binding was obtained by permeabilization of the targets with ice-cold acetone. Spontaneous PI binding was relatively low. This technique detected cytotoxicity at effector-to-target ratios (E:T) of 1:1 and after only 30 min cocultivation., RESULTS: Tilapia NCC from peripheral blood kill human transformed target cells by necrosis and apoptosis as identified by PI binding. Maximum killing of HL-60 targets (approximately 100%) occurred by 180 min cocultivation. For the same time, the killing of IM-9 did not exceed 60%. Almost 90% of IM-9 targets are lysed following 14 h of cocultivation. The maximum killing of both HL-60 and IM-9 targets was observed at a 25:1 E:T ratio after 14 h. Comparisons of the chromium(>51) release assay with flow detection of cytotoxicity revealed that FCM detected 55% lysis of the target cells compared with 2% cytotoxicity by chromium release, after a cocultivation time of 240 min., DISCUSSION: FCM detection of (teleost) NCC lysis of target cells using PI uptake is more sensitive than standard chromium release assays. This level of sensitivity was observed because NCC and targets were sufficiently different in size such that they could be resolved by scatter plots. Using FCM, cytotoxicity was detected earlier and at lower E:T ratios than previously reported for chromium release assays. Although tilapia were reported previously to be not capable of lysing IM-9 targets by chromium release detection, the more sensitive method of FCM detected cytotoxicity using PI uptake. HL-60 lysis by tilapia NCC exhibited saturable kinetics but occurred at different times post-cocultivation. Copyright 2001 Wiley-Liss, Inc.",Excluded

2841,"A CT-Based Automated Algorithm for Airway Segmentation Using Freeze-and-Grow Propagation and Deep Learning Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a common lung disease, and quantitative CT-based bronchial phenotypes are of increasing interest as a means of exploring COPD sub-phenotypes, establishing disease progression, and evaluating intervention outcomes. Reliable, fully automated, and accurate segmentation of pulmonary airway trees is critical to such exploration. We present a novel approach of multi-parametric freeze-and-grow (FG) propagation which starts with a conservative segmentation parameter and captures finer details through iterative parameter relaxation. First, a CT intensity-based FG algorithm is developed and applied for airway tree segmentation. A more efficient version is produced using deep learning methods generating airway lumen likelihood maps from CT images, which are input to the FG algorithm. Both CT intensity- and deep learning-based algorithms are fully automated, and their performance, in terms of repeat scan reproducibility, accuracy, and leakages, is evaluated and compared with results from several state-of-the-art methods including an industry-standard one, where segmentation results were manually reviewed and corrected. Both new algorithms show a reproducibility of 95% or higher for total lung capacity (TLC) repeat CT scans. Experiments on TLC CT scans from different imaging sites at standard and low radiation dosages show that both new algorithms outperform the other methods in terms of leakages and branch-level accuracy. Considering the performance and execution times, the deep learning-based FG algorithm is a fully automated option for large multi-site studies.Copyright © 1982-2012 IEEE.",Excluded
3279,"High expression of MMP-9 is associated with better prognosis in extrahepatic bile duct cancer patients Purpose: To evaluate the prognostic value of matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) in patients with extrahepatic bile duct (EHBD) cancer undergoing surgical resection and adjuvant radiotherapy. Method(s): Between January 2000 and August 2006, patients who underwent complete resection followed by adjuvant radiotherapy for EHBD cancer were enrolled in this study. The expression of MMP-9 was assessed with immunohistochemical staining. The prognostic values of the MMP-9 expression and other clinicopathologic factors were evaluated in univariate and multivariate analyses. Result(s): Sixty-six patients were included in this study. All received radiotherapy with a median dose of 40 Gy (range, 40-56), and 61 patients received concomitant fluoropyrimidine chemotherapy. MMP-9 was highly expressed in 33 patients (50.0%). MMP-9 expression was significantly associated with locoregional recurrence-free survival (LRRFS) and overall survival (OS) but not with distant metastasis-free survival (DMFS). The 5-year LRRFS and OS rates were 50.8% versus 86.5% (p =.0281), and 23.3% versus 68.1% (p =.0087) in patients with low and high expression of MMP-9, respectively. Among the clinicopathologic factors, tumor location was associated with DMFS and OS (p =.0292 and.0003, respectively). Nodal stage and histologic differentiation showed significant association with DMFS (p =.0277 and.0060, respectively). Based on multivariate analysis for OS, tumor location was the only significant prognostic factor (p =.0021), while MMP-9 expression showed marginal significance (p =.0633). Conclusion(s): MMP-9 expression is a useful prognostic factor for predicting LRRFS and OS in patients with EHBD cancer after surgical resection and adjuvant radiotherapy.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Ltd, BASO ~ The Association for Cancer Surgery, and the European Society of Surgical Oncology",Excluded
1593,"PATIENT DOSES IN COMPUTED TOMOGRAPHY EXAMINATIONS IN TWO REGIONS OF THE RUSSIAN FEDERATION Computed tomography (CT) is often a justified diagnostic tool, but is also associated with high exposure of the patients. Due to the rapid increase in the number of CT units and thus the availability of CT examinations in Russia, there is a growing need for optimisation within this field. In order to develop proper optimisation procedures for CT, the two regions St. Petersburg and Belgorod of Russia were chosen, representing an urban and a rural region, respectively. In 2014, a survey was conducted of the parameters applied in CT examinations in these regions, and the results show that the highest effective doses were observed for investigations of abdomen, reaching up to 137 mSv, and pelvic CT examinations, reaching up to 58 mSv, both with contrast agents. The dose distributions were approximately log-normal, and for the majority of the examinations, the 75th percentiles of the CT dose distributions in the Belgorod region were higher than observed in St. Petersburg. The aim of the current project is primarily to define and implement diagnostic reference levels as a part of the process of optimisation of CT examinations in Russia. Copyright © The Author 2016.

273,"Factors influencing aversion to specific electrodiagnostic studies Objective: To compare the degree of discomfort caused by nerve conduction studies (NCS) versus needle electromyography (EMG), and to determine what factors predict aversion to one test or the other. Method(s): Two hundred patients underwent both EMG and NCS, and were asked to indicate which test was more uncomfortable. Responses were then correlated with demographic information, testing characteristics, and medical histories to identify any notable associations. Result(s): Of the 200 patients, 58.5% (117) of the patients found the NCS more uncomfortable than EMG. Sixty-one percent (11/18) of the younger patients (18-29 years old) found EMG more uncomfortable (P = 0.08), whereas 68% (40/59) of the older patients (age greater than 60 years old) found NCS more uncomfortable (P = 0.05). Sixty-seven percent (14/21) of the patients whose BMI was less than 22 kg/m2 rated EMG as more uncomfortable (P = 0.01). Sixty-nine percent (27/39) of the patients whose BMI was greater than or equal to 38 found the NCS more uncomfortable (P = 0.02). A positive correlation existed between NCS discomfort and number of nerves tested. 67% (35/52) of the patients with polyneuropathy found NCS more uncomfortable. Conclusion(s): Nerve conduction studies are more uncomfortable than needle EMG in the majority of patients, and predictions regarding which test will be more uncomfortable for a given patient are possible. Nerve conduction studies are more uncomfortable than needle EMG for most patients, and predictions regarding which test will be more uncomfortable for a given patient are possible.Copyright © 2014 The Authors.

3246,"Effect of chromosome size on aberration levels caused by gamma radiation as detected by fluorescence in situ hybridization Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) is a powerful technique for detecting genomic alterations at the chromosome level. To study the effect of chromosome size on aberration formation, we used FISH to detect initial damage in individual prematurely condensed chromosomes (PCC) of gamma-irradiated G0 human cells. A linear dose response for breaks and a nonlinear dose response for exchanges was obtained using a chromosome 1-specific probe. FISH detected more chromosome 1 breaks than expected from DNA based extrapolation of Giemsa stained PCC preparations. The discrepancy in the number of breaks detected by the two techniques raised questions as to whether Giemsa staining and FISH differ in their sensitivities for detecting breaks, or is chromosome 1 uniquely sensitive to gamma-radiation. To address the question of technique sensitivity, we determined total chromosome damage by FISH using a total genomic painting probe; the results obtained from Giemsa-staining and FISH were nearly identical. To determine if chromosome 1 was uniquely sensitive, we selected four different sized chromosomes for paint probes and scored them for gamma-ray induced aberrations. In these studies the number of chromosome breaks per unit DNA increased linearly with an increase in the DNA content of the chromosomes. However, the number of exchanges per unit of DNA did not increase with an increase in chromosome size. This suggests that chromosome size may influence the levels of aberrations observed. Extrapolation from measurements of a single chromosome's damage to the whole genome requires that the relative DNA content of the measured chromosome be considered.",Excluded
941,"Age at exposure to ionising radiation and cancer mortality among Hanford workers: Follow up through 1994 Background: Studies of workers at the plutonium production factory in Hanford, WA have led to conflicting conclusions about the role of age at exposure as a modifier of associations between ionising radiation and cancer. Aim(s): To evaluate the influence of age at exposure on radiation risk estimates in an updated follow up of Hanford workers. Method(s): A cohort of 26 389 workers hired between 1944 and 1978 was followed through 1994 to ascertain vital status and causes of death. External radiation dose estimates were derived from personal dosimeters. Poisson regression was used to estimate associations between mortality and cumulative external radiation dose at all ages, and in specific age ranges. Result(s): A total of 8153 deaths were identified, 2265 of which included cancer as an underlying or contributory cause. Estimates of the excess relative risk per Sievert (ERR/Sv) for cumulative radiation doses at all ages combined were negative for all cause and leukaemia and positive for all cancer and lung cancer. Cumulative doses accrued at ages below 35, 35-44, and 45-54 showed little association with mortality. For cumulative dose accrued at ages 55 and above (10 year lag), the estimated ERR/Sv for all cancers was 3.24 (90% CI: 0.80 to 6.17), primarily due to an association with lung cancer (ERR/Sv. 9.05, 90% CI: 2.96 to 17.92). Conclusion(s): Associations between radiation and cancer mortality in this cohort are primarily a function of doses at older ages and deaths from lung cancer. The association of older age radiation exposures and cancer mortality is similar to observations from several other occupational studies.",Included

1023,"Allograft alone versus allograft with bone marrow concentrate for the healing of the instrumented posterolateral lumbar fusion Background context Spondylodesis in the operative management of lumbar spine diseases has been the subject of numerous studies over several decades. The posterolateral fusion (PLF) with pedicle screw fixation is a commonly used procedure. Purpose To determine whether the addition of bone marrow concentrate (BMC) to allograft bone increases fusion rate after instrumented posterior lumbar fusion. Study design The study was prospective, randomized, controlled, and blinded. Methods Eighty patients with degenerative disease of the lumbar spine underwent instrumented lumbar or lumbosacral PLF (22 men, 58 women; body mass index less than 35 for a good visualization of the PLF in the X-rays). In 40 cases, the PLF was done with spongious allograft chips alone (Group I, age 62.7 years in average, range 47-77 years, level of fusion 1-2). In another 40 cases, spongious allograft chips were mixed with BMC (Group II, age 58.5 years in average, range 42-80, level of fusion 1-3), including the mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs). Patients were scheduled for anteroposterior and lateral radiographs 12 and 24 months after the surgery and for computed tomography scanning 24 months after the surgery. Fusion status and the degree of mineralization of the fusion mass were evaluated separately by two radiologists blinded to patient group affiliation. The bony mass was judged as fused if there was uninterrupted bridging of well-mineralized bone between the transverse processes or sacrum, with trabeculation indicating bone maturation on least at one side of the spines. Results In Group I at 12 months, the bone graft mass was assessed in X-rays as fused in no cases (0%) and at 24 months in four cases (10%). In Group II, 6 cases (15%) achieved fusion at 12 months and 14 cases (35%) at 24 months. The statistically significant difference between both groups was proven for complete fusion at both 12 (p=.041) and 24 months (p=.011). Computed tomography scans showed that 16 cases (40%) in Group I and 32 cases (80%) in Group II had evidence of at least unilateral continuous bridging bone between neighboring vertebrae at 24 months (p<.05). Conclusions We have confirmed the hypothesis that the autologous BMC together with the allograft is a better alternative for PLF than the allograft alone. The use of autologous MSCs in form of BMC in combination with allograft is an effective option to enhance the PLF healing. © 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.",Excluded
2355,"'Plan of the day' adaptive radiotherapy for bladder cancer using helical tomotherapy Background and purpose: This study assessed the potential of tomotherapy based Image Guided Radiotherapy (IGRT) to increase the accuracy of bladder irradiation using a 'plan of the day' adaptive radiotherapy (ART) technique. Material(s) and Method(s): Ten patients with muscle invasive bladder cancer underwent bladder preservation with trimodality therapy in an ongoing trial. All patients received 64 Gy/32# to the whole bladder and seven of them received a boost of 68 Gy/32# to the tumour bed. The ART technique entailed the generation of six IMRT plans for each patient, using six isotropic PTVs of 5-30 mm applied to the bladder volume (CTV) to generate the PTVs. Megavoltage CT (MVCT) imaging was done to correct positioning errors and choose the 'plan of the day'. Result(s): Post treatment MVCT scans (315 scans) were used to generate multiple anisotropic PTVs for three hypothetical scenarios. Overall, coverage of anterior and superior walls required larger margins than other walls. Maximum geographical miss, in spite of IGRT, was noted for the superior (13.8%) and anterior walls (10.3%). Conclusion(s): Plan of the day ART is a feasible and promising technique for optimal treatment and dose escalation in bladder cancer. © 2011 Elsevier Ireland Ltd All rights reserved.

309,"Treatment outcomes of T4 locally advanced head and neck cancers with soft tissue invasion or bone and cartilage invasion PURPOSE/OBJECTIVE(S):: T4 locally advanced squamous cell cancers of the head and neck (SCCHN) with bone and cartilage invasion (BCI) traditionally have been treated with resection followed up with chemoradiotherapy (CRT). Because the organ preservation trials, more patients with BCI, as well as those with soft tissue invasion (STI), have been treated with definitive CRT. This is a review of our experience. MATERIALS/METHODS:: We performed a retrospective review of patients who underwent definitive CRT or radical resection followed up with postoperative CRT for T4N0-3M0 locally advanced SCCHN. We analyzed outcomes based on STI/BCI and types of treatment. Radiotherapy doses ranged from 59.4 to 72 Gy. Concurrent chemotherapy was platinum based in all CRT patients. RESULT(S):: From 1995 to 2006, 101 patients with locally advanced SCCHN were treated definitively. Of these, 51 had STI and 50 had BCI. Of the 51 patients with STI, 42 were treated with CRT, 5 patients were treated with resection followed by CRT, and 4 patients were treated with radiotherapy alone. Of the 50 patients with BCI, 26 patients were treated with CRT, 20 patients were treated with radical resection followed by radiotherapy or CRT, and 4 patients were treated with radiotherapy alone. Five-year local-regional control was 51% and 43% for STI and BCI patients treated with CRT, respectively, and 44% for BCI treated with radical resection. Five-year overall survival was 23%, 51%, and 28% for STI treated with CRT, BCI treated with CRT, and BCI treated with radical resection. Outcomes were not statistically different between these groups. CONCLUSION(S):: This study suggests similar outcomes for CRT or resection followed up with chemoradiotherapy for patients with locally advanced SCCHN with BCI. Concurrent CRT may be viable alternative to upfront resection in these patients. Further studies should be performed to validate these provocative findings.

1410,"Lumbar disc geometry affects the risk for rod fracture in adult spinal deformity (ASD) surgery BACKGROUND CONTEXT: Rod fracture (RF) has significant consequences for patients, including pain, loss of correction, and revision surgery. Risk factors associated with RF include previous spine surgery, insufficient sagittal vertical axis (SVA) correction and pedicle subtraction osteotomy (PSO). Increased lumbar disc geometry, regardless of PSO, SVA or previous surgery, may be a risk factor affecting RF rates. PURPOSE: To evaluate if larger disc geometry affects rod stresses adjacent to the PSO or apical lumbar vertebra increasing the risk of rod fracture. STUDY DESIGN/SETTING: Single center retrospective review. PATIENT SAMPLE: Thirty-nine patients with ASD who underwent open posterior fusion constructs crossing the T/L junction and pelvis with scoliosis x-rays and 2-year follow-up. OUTCOME MEASURES: Rod fracture complication; lumbar disc height, diameter, and volume. METHOD(S): All patients with ASD having open posterior fusion constructs crossing the T/L junction and pelvis with scoliosis x-rays and 2-year follow-up were included. Patients were divided into 2 Groups: Group 1-patients with RF; Group 2-No RF. RESULT(S): Thirty-nine of 52 patients met inclusion criteria. Group 1-included 15/39 (38%) patients with RF all requiring revision surgery. Group 2-included 24 (62%) patients without RF. There was no difference in age, construct length, number of nonfused lumbar discs, previous spinal surgery, pre- or postoperative SVA or PSOs between the Groups (Table 1). Vertical stature and male gender were significantly higher in the RF Group. There were significant differences between the RF vs No RF Groups in L1/2 disc heights (H) (8.5 vs 6.5 mm, p=.03), L2/3 H (9.6 vs 6.7 mm, p=.015); L1/2 diameters (D) (41.4 vs 34 mm, p<.01), L2/3 D (43.2 vs 36.2 mm, p=.01); and L1/2 volumes (V) (11714 vs 7817 mm3, p=.02), L2/3 V (14025 vs 8955 mm3, p=.02), respectively. L3/4 and L4/5 disc geometry was larger in the RF Group but did not reach statistical significance. CONCLUSION(S): The overall prevalence of RF was 38% with no differences in previous spinal surgery, SVA, or PSOs between the 2 Groups.Vertical stature and male gender were significantly higher in the RF Group. Patients with RF had significantly larger nonfused disc heights, diameters, and volumes adjacent to the PSO or apical lumbar vertebra.

3456,"New dose constraint reduces radiation-induced fatal pneumonitis in locally advanced non-small cell lung cancer patients treated with intensity-modulated radiotherapy Background. Intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) in locally advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) allows treatment of patients with large tumour volumes, but radiation pneumonitis (RP) remains a dose limiting complication. The incidence of severe RP using three-dimensional (3D) conformal radiotherapy, was previously reported to be 17%, with 2% lethal RP. The aim of this study was to monitor the incidence of RP following the introduction of IMRT.Material and methods. IMRT was delivered using 4-8 beam arrangements and introduced in three phases. In phase I, 12 patients were treated using only one dose constraint (V20), in which the total lung volume receiving 20 Gy was limited to 40%. In phase II, 25 patients were treated with an additional dose constraint of mean lung dose (MLD) <= 20 Gy. In phase III, 50 patients were treated with an extra dose constraint (V5) in which the total lung volume receiving a dose of 5 Gy was <= 60%. RP was prospectively documented. The results of phase I & II (IMRT-1) were compared to those in phase III (IMRT-2).Results. The median follow-up time was 17 months. The introduction of IMRT was associated with an increase in the incidence of RP in Phase I&II (IMRT-1) to 41%, six of 37 (16%) had grade 5 RP (IMRT-1). Introducing the dose constraint V5, led to a significant reduction in the lung volume receiving doses <= 20 Gy from 51 +/- 2% to 41 +/- 1% (p < 0.0001). Introducing V5 constraint did not decrease the incidence of severe (grade >= 3) RP, but significantly decreased the lethal pneumonitis to 4% (two of 50 patients), p = 0.05.Conclusion. Introducing IMRT resulted in an increase in the incidence of severe and fatal RP, however a new dose constraint to the volume of lung receiving low doses reduced the incidence of lethal pneumonitis.Copyright © 2015 Informa Healthcare.",Excluded
1281,"Local Control and Toxicity of Multilevel Spine Stereotactic Body Radiotherapy Spine stereotactic body radiotherapy (sSBRT) is commonly limited to 1 or 2 vertebral levels given a paucity of efficacy and toxicity data when more than 2 levels are treated. OBJECTIVE(S): To prove our hypothesis that multilevel sSBRT could provide similar rates of local control (LC) (primary endpoint) and toxicity as single-level treatment using the same clinical target, planning target, and planning organ-at-risk volumes. METHOD(S): We analyzed consecutive cases of sSBRT treated from 2013 to 2017. Time-to-event outcomes for single-level and multilevel cases were compared using mixed effect Cox models and differences in toxicity rates were evaluated using linear mixed effect models. All models incorporate a patient-level random intercept to account for any within-patient correlation across cases. RESULT(S): There were 101 single-level and 84 multilevel sSBRT cases (2-7 continuous vertebral levels). One-year LC was 95% vs 85%, respectively. After adjusting for baseline covariates, dose delivered, and accounting for within-patient correlation, there was no significant difference in time to local failure (hazard ratio, HR 1.79 [0.59-5.4]; P =. 30). Pain improved in 83.5% of the 139 initially symptomatic tumors. There were no significant differences in grade 2+ acute or late toxicities between single-level and multilevel sSBRT. CONCLUSION(S): With rigorous patient immobilization, quality assurance, and image guidance, multilevel sSBRT provides high rates of LC, similar to single-level treatment, without need for larger planning volume margins. Efforts to improve prognostication and case selection for multilevel sSBRT are warranted to ensure that the benefits of improved LC over palliative radiation are justified.Copyright © 2019 by the Congress of Neurological Surgeons.",Excluded

Sixty patients who were at high risk of developing bladder tumors (BT) were divided into two groups according to whether their EP images were obtained using an NI of 9.88 (29 patients; group A) or an NI of 20 and pNRF (31 patients; group B). The CT dose index volume (CTDI(vol)) and the contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR) of the bladder with respect to the anterior pelvic fat were compared in both groups. Qualitative assessment of the urinary bladder for image noise, sharpness, streak artifacts, homogeneity, and the conspicuity of polypoid or sessile-shaped BTs with a short-axis diameter greater than 10 mm was performed using a 3-point scale., RESULTS: The phantom study showed noise reduction of approximately 40% and 76% dose reduction between group A and group B. CTDI(vol) demonstrated a 73% reduction in group B (4.6 +/- 1.1 mGy) compared with group A (16.9 +/- 3.4 mGy).

The limits for reducing activities of thallium have not been determined, particularly in obese patients. After an injection of 0.7 megabecquerel (MBq) of thallium/kg, we collected an average 1.5 million counts for the 10-min acquisition in a pilot cohort of ten patients. After extrapolation, we reduced the administered activity to 0.5 MBq/kg to obtain the expected 1 million counts. We studied the image quality in 124 patients (86 men, 43 obese with body mass index over 30 kg/m2) referred for MPI. The quality of images was assessed by a number of recorded counts and visually by a four-grade scale (one-poor quality, four-excellent quality). In non-obese and obese patients, the average number of recorded counts was 1.1 vs. 1.07 million counts for the 10-min stress acquisition, 1.04 vs. 1.06 million counts for the 13-min rest acquisition, and the average quality score was 3.97 vs. 3.90, respectively (p = NS).

The clinical outcome of patients treated with IMRT for PNS malignancies are reported. Materials/Methods: Between May 2001 and June 2008, 31 patients with PNS malignancies were treated with IMRT to a median dose of 60 Gy in 30 fractions. There were 13 males and 18 females, with median age 68 years. Seventeen (59%) patients had AJCC stage III/IV disease at presentation. Twenty one of 31 patients presented with clinical stage N0 neck disease. Elective nodal irradiation (ENI) is not considered due to low incidence of lymph node metastases among these patients. Histology was: 14 squamous cell, 3 adenocarcinoma, 3 adenoid cystic, 6 mucosal melanoma, 5 others. The base of skull was treated in 3 patients with perineural invasion.

The degree of lung fibrosis was estimated by fibrosis volume and the dosimetric parameters were calculated from the plan of 3-dimensional conformal radiotherapy., RESULTS: The fibrosis volume and V-dose as dosimetric parameters showed significant correlation and the correlation coefficient ranged from 0.602 to 0.683 (P<0.01). The degree of the correlation line was steeper as the dose increase and threshold dose was not found. Mean lung dose (MLD) showed strong correlation with fibrosis volume (correlation coefficient = 0.726, P<0.01)., CONCLUSIONS: The fibrosis volume is continuously increased with V-dose as the reference dose increases. MLD is useful as a single parameter for comparing rival plans in the aspect of RILF. Copyright © 2012 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.",Excluded
690,"Comparison of Machine Learning Optimal Classification Trees With the Pediatric Emergency Care Applied Research Network Head Trauma Decision Rules Importance: Computed tomographic (CT) scanning is the standard for the rapid diagnosis of intracranial injury, but it is costly and exposes patients to ionizing radiation. The Pediatric Emergency Care Applied Research Network (PECARN) rules for identifying children with minor head trauma who are at very low risk of clinically important traumatic brain injury (ciTBI) are widely used to triage CT imaging. Objective: To examine whether optimal classification trees (OCTs), which are novel machine-learning classifiers, improve on PECARN rules' predictive accuracy. Design, Setting, and Participants: A secondary analysis of prospective, publicly available data on emergency department visits for head trauma used by the PECARN group to develop their tool was conducted to derive OCT-based prediction rules for ciTBI in a development cohort and compare their predictive performance vs the PECARN rules in a validation cohort among children who were younger than 2 years and 2 years or older. Data on 42412 children with head trauma and without severely altered mental status who were examined between June 1, 2004, and September 30, 2006, were gathered from 25 emergency departments in North America participating in PECARN. Data analysis was conducted from September 15, 2016, to December 18, 2018. Main Outcomes and Measures: The outcome was ciTBI, with predictive performance measured by estimating the sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value, positive likelihood ratio, and negative likelihood ratio for the OCT and the PECARN rules. The OCT and PECARN rules' performance was compared by estimating ratios for each measure. Results: Of the 42412 children (15 996 [37.7%] girls) included in the analysis, 10718 were younger than 2 years (25.3%; mean [SD] age, 11.6 [0.6] months) and 31694 were 2 years or older (74.7%; age, 9.1 [4.9] years). Compared with PECARN rules, OCTs misclassified 0 vs 1 child with ciTBI in the younger and 10 vs 9 children with ciTBI in the older cohort, and correctly identified more children with very low risk of ciTBI in the younger (7605 vs 5701) and older (20 594 vs 18 134) cohorts. In the validation cohorts, compared with the PECARN rules, the OCTs had statistically significantly better specificity (in the younger cohort: 69.3%; 95% CI, 67.4%-71.2% vs 52.8%; 95% CI, 50.8%-54.9%; in the older cohort: 65.6%; 95% CI, 64.5%-66.8% vs 57.6%; 95% CI, 56.4%-58.8%), positive predictive value (odds ratios, 1.54; 95% CI, 1.36-1.74 and 1.23; 95% CI, 1.17-1.30, in younger and older children, respectively), and positive likelihood ratio (risk ratios, 1.54; 95% CI, 1.36-1.74 and 1.23; 95% CI, 1.17-1.30, in younger and older children, respectively). There were no statistically significant differences in the sensitivity, negative predictive value, and negative likelihood ratio between the 2 sets of rules. Conclusions and Relevance: If implemented, OCTs may help reduce the number of unnecessary CT scans, without missing more patients with ciTBI than the PECARN rules.",Excluded

The sensitivity of the method was compared with chest radiography for detecting radiation-induced changes in the lung, regional alterations within (irradiated region) and outside (shielded region) the treatment ports, effect of irradiated lung volume, and dependence on time after radiotherapy., METHODS: Serial DTPA lung clearance studies were performed before the first radiation treatment (baseline), then weekly during a 5- to 7-wk course, and up to 12 times post-therapy over periods of 56-574 days. The total activity deposited in the lungs for each study was approximately 150 microCi (approximately 5.6 MBq). DTPA clearance, expressed in terms of the biological half-time, t 1/2, was computed from the slopes of the least-squares fit regression lines of the time-activity curves for the first 10 min for irradiated and shielded lung regions., RESULTS: Major findings include: (a) significant and early DTPA t 1/2 changes were observed in all patients during and after radiotherapy; (b) changes in DTPA t 1/2 values were observed in both irradiated and shielded lung regions in all patients suggesting a radiation-induced systemic reaction; (c) changes in DTPA t 1/2 values were correlated (p < 0.05) with the irradiated lung volumes; (d) significantly reduced DTPA t 1/2 values were observed in three patients who subsequently presented with clinical symptoms and/or radiographic changes consistent with radiation pneumonitis (t1/2 felt to 19% +/- 6% of baseline values, compared with 64% +/- 17% in the remaining patients [p < 0.01]); (e) the onset of decreased DTPA t 1/2 values in these three patients occurred 35-84 days before clinical symptoms and/or radiographic changes; and (f) DTPA t 1/2 tended to approach baseline values with time after radiotherapy, suggesting a long-term recovery in lung injury., CONCLUSION: These observations show significant and early alterations in DTPA lung clearance during and after radiotherapy that may provide a sensitive assay to monitor changes in radiation-induced lung injury and may facilitate early therapeutic intervention.",Included
1078,"Polymorphisms of DNA damage response genes in radiation-related and sporadic papillary thyroid carcinoma Papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC) etiologically occurs as a radiation-induced or sporadic malignancy. Genetic factors contributing to the susceptibility to either form remain unknown. In this retrospective case-control study, we evaluated possible associations between single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the candidate DNA damage response genes (ATM, XRCC1, TP53, XRCC3, MTF1) and risk of radiation-induced and sporadic PTC. A total of 255 PTC cases (123 Chernobyl radiation-induced and 132 sporadic, all in Caucasians) and 596 healthy controls (198 residents of Chernobyl areas and 398 subjects without history of radiation exposure, all Caucasians) were genotyped. The risk of PTC and SNPs interactions with radiation exposure were assessed by logistic regressions. The ATM G5557A and XRCC1 Arg399Gln polymorphisms, regardless of radiation exposure, associated with a decreased risk of PTC according to the multiplicative and dominant models of inheritance (odds ratio (OR) = 0.69, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.45-0.86 and OR = 0.70, 95% CI 0.59-0.93 respectively). The ATM IVS22-77 T > C and TP53 Arg72Pro SNPs interacted with radiation (P = 0.04 and P = 0.01 respectively). ATM IVS22-77 associated with the increased risk of sporadic PTC (OR = 1.84, 95% CI 1.10-3.24) whereas TP53 Arg72Pro correlated with the higher risk of radiogenic PTC (OR = 1.80, 95% CI 1.06-2.36). In the analyses of ATM/TP53 (rs1801516/rs664677/rs609429/rs1042522) combinations, the GG/TC/CG/GC genotype strongly associated with radiation-induced PTC (OR = 2.10, 95% CI 1.17-3.78). The GG/CC/GG/GG genotype displayed a significantly increased risk for sporadic PTC (OR = 3.32, 95% CI 1.57-6.99). The results indicate that polymorphisms of DNA damage response genes may be potential risk modifiers of ionizing radiation-induced or sporadic PTCs.",Included
3411,"Cerebral embolism in cancer patients Sudden neurological deterioration suggesting embolism in a patient with a history of cancer should alert the physician to the possibility of a non-metastatic, and therefore potentially reversible, cause of cerebral embolism before cerebral metastasis is implicated. During a four year period, we have observed eight cases of acute cerebral embolism among 3000 cancer patients seen in a department of medical oncology. Five patients had features post mortem of non-bacterial thrombotic endocarditis, and in one, the diagnosis had been made antemortem, but treatment with heparin did not prevent further emboli. Two patients had radiation related carotid vascular disease, and one patient post lymphangiographic embolism. The literature reporting these uncommon causes of cerebral embolism is reviewed. Post-lymphangiographic embolism carries a uniformly good prognosis. In selected cases of post-irradiation cerebral embolism, surgical intervention may prevent a neurological catastrophe. Non-bacterial thrombotic endocarditis and mucin embolism are of uncertain aetiology and natural history; long-term survival is uncommon, and treatment does not appear to influence the clinical course or outcome.",Excluded
2307,"Quantitative assessment of left atrial volume by electrocardiographic-gated contrast-enhanced multidetector computed tomography BACKGROUND: Left atrial (LA) volume is a predictor of cardiovascular events. Information on LA volume is available on contrast-enhanced electrocardiogram (EGC)-gated multidetector computed tomography (MDCT) scans., OBJECTIVE: To assess interobserver and intraobserver reproducibility of 3-dimensional threshold-based volume (3DTV) and 2-dimensional (2D) measurements for the assessment of LA volumes with contrast-enhanced cardiac 64-slice MDCT., METHODS: Contrast-enhanced 64-slice MDCT (0.6-mm slice thickness, 120 kVp, 850 mAseff) was performed in 96 consecutive subjects (mean age 52 years; 48% women) as a subset of the Rule Out Myocardial Infarction using Computer Assisted Tomography trial. Two observers independently measured maximal (LAV(max)) and minimal (LAV(min)) LA volumes with (1) a modified Simpson's method (3DTV) based on delineation of LA areas in axial slices and (2) estimated LA volumes typically used in 2D echocardiography (area length and prolate ellipse). Interobserver and intraobserver reproducibility for each method as well as correlations between the methods were calculated., RESULTS: Interobserver (n = 96) and intraobserver (n = 20) variability was significantly lower for 3DTV (8%) than for area length (13%; P < 0.001) or prolate ellipse (16%; P < 0.001). 2D-based measurements rendered significantly lower LA volumes than did 3DTV (area length: -17% and -22%; prolate ellipse: -43% and -46% for LAV(max) and LAV(min), respectively; P < 0.001 for all). By 3DTV, mean LA volume was 90.4 +/- 24.5 mL for LAV(max) and 52.5 +/- 17.6 mL for LAV(min)., CONCLUSION: ECG-gated contrast-enhanced cardiac MDCT offers volumetric assessment of LA volume with excellent reproducibility without additional contrast administration or radiation exposure. 3D measures of LA volume are more reproducible and render larger volumes than 2D-derived estimates, typically used in echocardiography.",Excluded
3414,"Expert opinions of the first Italian Consensus Conference on the management of malignant pleural mesothelioma Malignant pleural mesothelioma (MPM) is a very important public health issue. A large amount of data indicates a relationship between mesothelioma and asbestos exposure. The incidence has both considerably and constantly increased over the past 2 decades in the industrialized countries and is expected to peak in 2010-2020. In Italy, a standardized-rate incidence in 2002 among men was 2.98 per 100,000 and 0.98 per 100,000 among women, with wide differences from one region to another. Stage diagnosis and definition may be difficult. Management of patients with MPM remains complex, so an optimal treatment strategy has not yet been clearly defined.

3534,"Prognostic Factors in Emergency Department Patients with Glyphosate Surfactant Intoxication: Point-of-Care Lactate Testing An increasing number of suicide attempts involve the ingestion of glyphosate surfactant; hence, clinical toxicologists may encounter severe cases of glyphosate surfactant intoxication. In several other clinical conditions, serum lactate is used to predict outcome. We investigated the relationship between lactate levels and 30-day mortality from glyphosate surfactant poisoning. This retrospective analysis involved 232 patients who were admitted to the emergency department after acute glyphosate surfactant poisoning between January 2004 and June 2014. We used a receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve to define the optimal cut-off point for lactate levels. A Kaplan-Meier 30-day survival curve was then analysed in terms of the defined cut-off level. We used multi-variate Cox proportional hazards regression analysis to determine the risk factors for 30-day mortality. Of the 232 patients, 29 died, yielding a case fatality rate of 12.5%. Lactate was significantly higher in non-survivors (6.5 +/- 3.1 mmol/L) than in survivors (3.3 +/- 2.2 mmol/L; p < 0.001), and elevated lactate was significantly associated with 30-day mortality. The area under the ROC curve of lactate levels was 0.836 [95% confidence interval (CI): 0.716-0.869]. Lactate levels higher than 4.7 mmol/L were associated with increased mortality in multi-variable analysis (hazard ratio: 3.2; 95% CI: 1.1-8.7). Besides lactate, age >59 years, corrected QT interval >495 ms and potassium >5.5 mmol/L were independent risk factors for 30-day mortality. Lactate is an independent predictor of 30-day mortality in patients with glyphosate surfactant poisoning. Early measurement of lactate levels may be a simple and practical way to assess the severity of intoxication.Copyright © 2016 Nordic Association for the Publication of BCPT (former Nordic Pharmacological Society)",Excluded

2058,"Computed tomography-guided percutaneous infiltrations for piriformis syndrome: A single-center retrospective study Piriformis syndrome (PS), first described by Yeoman in 1928, is a general term referring to low back pain, sciatica, and instability. PS has a 6% incidence rate worldwide. In this study, we aim to retrospectively evaluate the effectiveness of computed tomography (CT)-guided percutaneous infiltration in a series of consecutive PS patients who have symptoms that are refractory to conservative therapies. An institutional database search identified 20 such consecutive patients who underwent infiltration with a mixture of long-acting corticosteroid and local anesthetic. Preoperational evaluation included physical examination and magnetic resonance imaging. The correct position of the 22-gauge spinal needle was verified with CT scan after contrast medium injection. Pain measured before the procedure and at 1 wk and 1, 6, and 12 mo after the procedure was compared by means of a numeric visual scale (NVS) questionnaire. The mean pain score before CT-guided percutaneous infiltration was 8.95 +/- 1.432 NVS units. This score was reduced to a mean value of 0.85 +/- 0.933 units at 1 wk, 0.90 +/- 0.852 at 1 mo, 1.10 +/- 1.165 at 6 mo, and 1.20 +/- 1.399 at 12 mo follow-up (p < 0.001). Two patients of 20 (10%) underwent a second infiltration that was performed at 7 and 10 d after the first, respectively. No complications were observed. CT-guided infiltration seems to be a feasible, efficacious, and safe approach for pain reduction and mobility improvement in patients with symptomatic PS.Copyright © 2020 by Begell House, Inc. www.begellhouse.com.",Excluded

We reviewed the value of FRAX in a male population, to evaluate (1) if FRAX can identify patients with fracture risk (2) If it is relevant in patients without established risk factors. We reviewed all the DXA examinations in 2,5 years (1st July 2013 to 30th December 2015).A total of 6185 patients were examined with at least spine and femur analysis. During this period 395 examinations were done in men, of which 49 were excluded (7 which were incomplete and 42 patients who were on osteoporosis therapy). The study population consisted therefore of 346 examinations. Patients filled in a questionnaire. The technologist reviewed that data, inquired about fracture mechanisms and discussed risk factors with the patients. In many cases other relevant examinations (spine or hip x-ray, CT, MR) could be accessed on PACS. We had no laboratorial data. Previous fragility fractures were identified in 84 patients. For this study,FRAX values in patients with fractures were calculated ""without fracture"". We chose 10% as the threshold for the 10 year probability of major osteoporotic fracture (PMOF). The ratio of fractures increased slightly with age groups, except after 80y, and was very similar to osteoporosis diagnosed by DXA. Correlation with FRAX values was less reliable and FRAX identified much fewer cases. In patients without risk factors,FRAX didn't identify any patient with 10 year PMOF > 8%. The study population has several limitations: Its size is very small in comparison with studies with female patients, and it can suffer a selection bias. The poor performance of the FRAX threshold against DXAT-scores should be validated in a larger and prospective study. In the Portuguese male population even FRAX values computed with bone mineral density (BMD) data can sub evaluate fracture risk. FRAX values obtained without BMD should be interpreted with precaution. (Figure Presented).",Excluded
252,"Removal of comfort pads underneath babies: a method of reducing radiation exposure to neonates RATIONALE AND OBJECTIVES: The recent increasing utilization of imaging has increased the population exposure to ionizing radiation. With increasing knowledge of the potential harm of radiation exposure, efforts should be made to minimize patient radiation whenever possible, especially in young children. The purpose of this study was to use the exposure index (EI) standard to assess the potential for reducing radiation dose to babies by removing a soft comfort pad, often placed underneath the baby. The pad is located between the baby and the image detector plate. As such it absorbs x-rays that have already passed through the baby but have not yet reached the imaging detector plate. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Using a thoracic infant phantom and fixed exposure factors, we measured the percentage of the radiation exiting a neonatal chest phantom that was absorbed/attenuated by the comfort pad, before it hit the detector to create the image. We studied comfort pads of 4 different thicknesses, ranging from 0.5 to 8. RESULTS: Radiation beam attenuation, ranging from 12% to 72.1%, was found with all comfort pads, with increased x-ray beam attenuation occurring with increasing pad thickness. CONCLUSIONS: The study shows that comfort pads cause a high attenuation of the radiation beam, after it exits the chest phantom. As such, removal of the pads prior to radiographic exposure of babies is a method of potentially reducing patient radiation exposure in the newborn nursery.",Excluded

These results show that health conditions of the liquidators became worse during the whole observation period. A considerable development of both pathological states atypical of radiation damages and diseases, which may be considered as radiation-induced ones, was determined. Rise of the sickness rate of almost all organism systems, first of all, nervous, cardiovascular, respiratory and digestive ones, was observed. In 70% of liquidators the main disease was primarily detected after working on CNPP. In the intervening years, the average number of diagnoses per 1 liquidator increased from 1.5 in 1987 to 7-8 in the recent time. In addition to the detected diseases, particular functional shifts in neuropsychological and vegetative status of the liquidators were observed. The overwhelming majority of them have increased tonicity of the sympathetic vegetative nervous system, asthenic and depressive syndromes occurring in the form of weakness, somnolence, mood instability, mental capacity decrease, and memory defects. In the paper, the results of investigations aimed at clarification of changes in biological aging processes of the liquidators and assessment of their ""life quality"" features in terms of physical, psychical and social welfare are considered. Biological aged-related passportization in a definite part of liquidators elucidated an accelerated aging rate.

3648,"Definitive chemoradiotherapy of limited-disease small cell lung cancer: Retrospective analysis of new predictive factors affecting treatment results The aim of this study was to evaluate potential predictive factors in the treatment of limited-disease small cell lung cancer (LD-SCLC). A total of 33 patients with LD-SCLC who underwent definitive chemoradiotherapy at our institute between April 1996 and May 2007 were enrolled in our retrospective study. The relationship between a range of potential predictive factors and the initial response, time to progression and pattern of failure was analyzed. The factors evaluated included the tumor markers Pro-gastrin-releasing peptide (Pro-GRP) and neuron-specific enolase; net tumor size (sum of each lesion mass on computed tomography at 1-cm intervals); total radiation dose; biological effective dose (BED); overall treatment time (OTT); time between the start of any type of treatment and the end of radiation therapy (SER). In addition, the novel factors of radiation dose-intensity (RDI = BED/OTT) and RDI/NTS (= RDI/net tumor size) were defined. Of the 33 patients evaluated in our study, 22 (67%) achieved a complete response (CR) and 27 (82%) experienced treatment failure or recurrence. High RDI/NTS values showed a significant correlation with CR (P=0.043). Prolonged OTT and lower values of RDI and RDI/NTS showed a significant correlation with recurrence within 12 months (P=0.022, 0.033 and 0.015, respectively). The lower values of RDI and RDI/NTS showed a significant correlation with distant metastasis as a first failure site (P=0.038 and 0.044, respectively). Patients with RDI/NTS =0.08 had a more favorable prognosis (P=0.045). Thus, RDI and RDI/NTS may become beneficial predictive factors in the treatment of LD-SCLC.

2691,"Maternal effects of the scid mutation on radiation-induced transgenerational instability in mice The results of a number of recent studies show that mutation rates in the offspring of irradiated parents are substantially elevated, however, the effect of parental genotype on transgenerational instability remains poorly understood. Here, we have analysed the mutation frequency at an expanded simple tandem repeat (ESTR) locus in the germline and bone marrow of the first-generation male offspring of control and irradiated male mice. The frequency of ESTR mutation was studied in the offspring of two reciprocal matings male symbol scid x female symbol BALB/c and male symbol BALB/c x female symbol scid, which were compared with that in BALB/c mice. In the offspring of the BALB/c x BALB/c and male symbol scid x female symbol BALB/c matings, which were conceived after paternal sperm irradiation, the frequency of ESTR mutation was significantly elevated in both tissues. In contrast, ESTR mutation frequency was only slightly elevated in the offspring of male symbol BALB/c x female symbol scid mating conceived after paternal irradiation. The results of this study suggest that the oocytes of scid females are unable to fully support the repair of double-strand breaks induced in paternal sperm which may in turn result in the elimination of cells/embryos containing high levels of DNA damage, thus partially preventing the manifestation of genomic instability.",Excluded
788,"G2 repair and chromosomal damage in lymphocytes from workers occupationally exposed to low-level ionizing radiation The effect of the G2 repair of chromosomal damage in lymphocytes from workers exposed to low levels of X- or gamma-rays was evaluated. Samples of peripheral blood were collected from 15 radiation workers, 20 subjects working in radiodiagnostics, and 30 healthy control donors. Chromosomal aberrations (CA) were evaluated by scoring the presence of chromatid and isochromatid breaks, dicentric and ring chromosomes in lymphocytes with/without 5 mM caffeine plus 3 mM-aminobenzamide (3-AB) treatment during G2. Our results showed that the mean value of basal aberrations in lymphocytes from exposed workers was higher than in control cells (p < 0.001). The chromosomal damage in G2, detected with caffeine plus 3-AB treatment was higher than the basal damage (untreated conditions), both in control and exposed populations (p < 0.05). In the exposed workers group, the mean value of chromosomal abnormalities in G2 was higher than in the control (p < 0.0001). No correlation was found between the frequency of chromosome type of aberrations (basal or in G2), and the absorbed dose. Nevertheless, significant correlation coefficients (p < 0.05) between absorbed dose and basal aberrations yield (r = 0.430) or in G2 (r = 0.448) were detected when chromatid breaks were included in the total aberrations yield. Under this latter condition no significant effect of age, years of employment or smoking habit on the chromosomal aberrations yield was detected. However, analysis of the relationship between basal aberrations yield and the efficiency of G2 repair mechanisms, defined as the percentage of chromosomal lesions repaired in G2, showed a significant correlation coefficient (r = -0.802; p < 0.001). These results suggest that in addition to the absorbed dose, the individual G2 repair efficiency may be another important factor affecting the chromosomal aberrations yield detected in workers exposed to low-level ionizing radiation.",Included

Carbon dioxide laser is an established procedure for the treatment of non-malignant cricopharyngeal disorders. We report our experience of laser cricopharyngeal myotomy with objective swallowing outcome measures, before and after treatment., METHODS: We identified 11 patients who had undergone carbon dioxide laser cricopharyngeal myotomy for dysphagia following radiotherapy, with or without chemotheraphy between January 2006 and July 2011. We analysed the swallowing outcomes following carbon dioxide laser cricopharyngeal myotomy by retrospective grading of pre- and post-procedure videofluoroscopic swallowing study of liquids, using the validated Modified Barium Swallow Impairment Profile., RESULTS: The median Modified Barium Swallow Impairment Profile score was 13 pre-myotomy and 10 post-myotomy. This difference between scores was non-significant (p = 0.41). The median, cricopharyngeal-specific Modified Barium Swallow Impairment Profile variables (14 and 17) improved from 3 to 2, but were similarly non-significant (p = 0.16). We observed the improved Modified Barium Swallow Impairment Profile scores post-procedure in the majority of patients., CONCLUSION: Endoscopic carbon dioxide laser cricopharyngeal myotomy remains a viable option in treatment-related cricopharyngeal dysfunction; its targeted role requires further prospective study.

Patients and Methods: Between January 1994 and March 2000, 54 consecutive patients presenting with 97 metastases relapsing after whole brain radiotherapy (WBRT) were treated with stereotactic radiotherapy. Median interval between the end of WBRT and radiosurgery was 9 months (range 2-70). Median age was 53 years (24-80), and median Karnofski performance status (KPS) 70 (60-100). Forty-seven patients had one radiosurgery, five had two and two had three. Median metastasis diameter and volume were 21 mm (6-59) and 1.2 cc (0.1-95.2), respectively. A Leksell stereotactic head frame (Leksell Model G, Elektra, Instrument, Tucker, GA) was applied under local anesthesia. Irradiation was delivered by a gantry mounted linear accelerator (linacs) (Saturne, General Electric). Median minimal dose delivered to the gross disease was 16.2 Gy (11.8-23), and median maximal dose 21.2 Gy (14- 42). Result(s): Median follow-up was 9 months (1-57). Five metastases recurred. One- and 2-year metastasis local control rates were 91.3 and 84% and 1- and 2-year brain control rates were 65 and 57%, respectively. Six patients died of brain metastasis evolution, and three of leptomeningeal carcinomatosis. One- and 2-year overall survival rates were 31 and 28%, respectively. According to univariate analysis, KPS, RPA class, SIR score and interval between WBRT and radiosurgery were prognostic factors of overall survival and brain free-disease survival. According to multivariate analysis, RPA was an independent factor of overall survival and brain free-disease survival, and the interval between WBRT and radiosurgery longer than 14 months was associated with longer brain free-disease survival. Side effects were minimal, with only two cases of headaches and two of grade 2 alopecia. Conclusion(s): Salvage radiosurgery of metastasis recurring after whole brain irradiation is an effective and accurate treatment which could be proposed to patients with a KPS > 70 and a primary tumour controlled or indolent.

Although similar findings have been observed in populations exposed to low-dose, protracted radiation, such studies lack information on cigarette smoking history, a potential confounder. In a cohort of 106 068 U.S. radiologic technologists, we examined the association between estimated cumulative lung absorbed dose from occupational radiation exposure and lung cancer mortality. Poisson regression models, adjusted for attained age, sex, birth cohort, pack-years smoked and years since quitting smoking, were used to calculate linear excess relative risks (ERR) per 100 mGy, using time-dependent cumulative lung absorbed dose, lagged 10 years. Mean cumulative absorbed dose to the lung was 25 mGy (range: 0-810 mGy). During the 1983 to 2012 follow-up, 1090 participants died from lung cancer. Greater occupational radiation lung dose was not associated with lung cancer mortality overall (ERR per 100 mGy: -0.02, 95% CI: <0-0.13). However, significant dose-response relationships were observed for some subgroups, which might be false-positive results given the number of statistical tests performed. As observed in other studies of radiation and smoking, the interaction between radiation and smoking appeared to be sub-multiplicative with an ERR per 100 mGy of 0.41 (95% CI: 0.01-1.15) for those who smoked <20 pack-years and -0.03 (95% CI: <0-0.15) for those who smoked >=20 pack-years. Our study provides some evidence that greater protracted radiation exposure in the low-dose range is positively associated with lung cancer mortality.Copyright © 2020 UICC",Included
2820,"A randomized study comparing the use of a pelvic lead shield during trans-radial interventions: Threefold decrease in radiation to the operator but double exposure to the patient OBJECTIVES: To determine the efficacy of a 0.5-mm lead apron across the patient's abdomen in addition to standard operator protection for the reduction of scatter radiation on operator and patient radiation exposure, BACKGROUND: Cardiac angiography using the radial access compared to the femoral approach is associated with reduced complication rate and improved patient comfort but has significantly increased radiation dose. Improvements in radiation protection are needed, METHODS: We randomly assigned 332 patients undergoing coronary angiography to a group with pelvic lead shielding and a group with standard protection. In each procedure, eight digital dosimeters were used to measure operator radiation dose [under the lead apron, outside the thyroid shield, and at the left side of the head], patient dose at the level of the umbilicus [above and beneath the lead apron], and two on the acrylic shielding and one on the image receptor to measure scattered radiation, RESULTS: Both groups were similar in BMI, procedures performed, and number of sequences. Usage of lead shielding statistically significantly reduced the radiation dose of the operator at all three sites measured: under lead apron [all in microSv]: 0.53 +/- 1.4 vs. 0.17 +/- 0.6, on thyroid collar 5.9 +/- 7.7 vs. 2.9 +/- 3.4, and left side of head 3.3 +/- 3.4 vs. 2.1 +/- 2.2, P<0.001. However the radiation to the patient was doubled from 15.4 +/- 24.1 to 28.9 +/- 81.1, P=0.04 CONCLUSIONS: The use of a pelvic lead shield during radial angiography reduced the operator radiation exposure at multiple measurement sites. However there was an increased exposure to the patient. This balance should be further investigated before the widespread adoption of this method. . Copyright © 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",Excluded
577,"Texture analysis for the assessment of structural changes in parotid glands induced by radiotherapy BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: During radiotherapy (RT) for head-and-neck cancer, parotid glands undergo significant anatomic, functional and structural changes which could characterize pre-clinical signs of an increased risk of xerostomia. Texture analysis is proposed to assess structural changes of parotids induced by RT, and to investigate whether early variations of textural parameters (such as mean intensity and fractal dimension) can predict parotid shrinkage at the end of treatment., MATERIAL AND METHODS: Textural parameters and volumes of 42 parotids from 21 patients treated with intensity-modulated RT for nasopharyngeal cancer were extracted from CT images. To individuate which parameters changed during RT, a Wilcoxon signed-rank test between textural indices (first and second RT week; first and last RT week) was performed. Discriminant analysis was applied to variations of these parameters in the first two weeks of RT to assess their power in predicting parotid shrinkage at the end of RT., RESULTS: A significant decrease in mean intensity (1.7 HU and 3.8 HU after the second and last weeks, respectively) and fractal dimension (0.016 and 0.021) was found. Discriminant analysis, based on volume and fractal dimension, was able to predict the final parotid shrinkage (accuracy of 71.4%)., CONCLUSION: Textural features could be used in combination with volume to characterize structural modifications on parotid glands and to predict parotid shrinkage at the end of RT.

Six of the 8 subjects were able to tolerate 2 min at peak +2 Gz, 2-5 min at +3 Gz, and 1-2 min at +4 Gz. Heart rate (HR) at any given level of upright LBNP regularly exceeded supine levels. HR change at -50 mm Hg in upright subjects (+47.7 bpm from 74.1 +/- 1.9 (M +/- S.E.) bpm, control) was 2.6 times greater than in supine subjects (+18.3 bpm from 64.8 +/- 2.8 bpm, control). HR values at -40 mm Hg supine (73.7 +/- 2.6) matched seated upright pre-LBNP control levels (74.1 +/- 1.9 bpm), while values at -70 mm Hg supine (102.5 +/- 4.4 bpm) were not significantly different from those at -40 mm Hg upright (103.1 +/- 4.0 bpm). Peak HR during +3 Gz (145.8 +/- 7.7 bpm) and +4 Gz (152.3 +/- 6.5 bpm) significantly exceeded recorded supine and upright LBNP levels, whereas values at +2 Gz (104.8 +/- 5.5 bpm) closely matched those at -40 mm Hg upright (103.1 +/- 4.0 bpm) and -70 mm Hg supine (102.5 +/- 4.4 bpm). Supine LBNP HR changes in this relatively small group of subjects closely matched those previously reported in the literature.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",Excluded

3159,"Image Quality Assessment of Abdominal CT by Use of New Deep Learning Image Reconstruction: Initial Experience OBJECTIVE. The purpose of this study was to perform quantitative and qualitative evaluation of a deep learning image reconstruction (DLIR) algorithm in contrast-enhanced oncologic CT of the abdomen. MATERIALS AND METHODS. Retrospective review (April-May 2019) of the cases of adults undergoing oncologic staging with portal venous phase abdominal CT was conducted for evaluation of standard 30% adaptive statistical iterative reconstruction V (30% ASIR-V) reconstruction compared with DLIR at low, medium, and high strengths. Attenuation and noise measurements were performed. Two radiologists, blinded to examination details, scored six categories while comparing reconstructions for overall image quality, lesion diagnostic confidence, artifacts, image noise and texture, lesion conspicuity, and resolution. RESULTS. DLIR had a better contrast-to-noise ratio than 30% ASIR-V did; high-strength DLIR performed the best. High-strength DLIR was associated with 47% reduction in noise, resulting in a 92-94% increase in contrast-to-noise ratio compared with that of 30% ASIR-V. For overall image quality and image noise and texture, DLIR scored significantly higher than 30% ASIR-V with significantly higher scores as DLIR strength increased. A total of 193 lesions were identified. The lesion diagnostic confidence, conspicuity, and artifact scores were significantly higher for all DLIR levels than for 30% ASIR-V. There was no significant difference in perceived resolution between the reconstruction methods. CONCLUSION. Compared with 30% ASIR-V, DLIR improved CT evaluation of the abdomen in the portal venous phase. DLIR strength should be chosen to balance the degree of desired denoising for a clinical task relative to mild blurring, which increases with progressively higher DLIR strengths.",Excluded
3547,"Protein expression of nucleophosmin, annexin A3 and nm23-H1 correlates with human nasopharyngeal carcinoma radioresistance in vivo Radioresistance is a significant obstacle in the treatment of endemic nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC). The present study aimed to identify proteins associated with radioresistance in NPC in vitro and in vivo. Proteomics analyses were conducted to screen for differentially-expressed proteins (DEPs) in parental CNE-2 cells and CNE-2R cells. Using proteomics approaches, 16 DEPs were identified. Of these DEPs, nucleophosmin (NPM1), annexin A3 and nm23-H1, were verified using western blot analyses. The tumorigenicity was investigated using mouse xenograft tumorigenicity assays, and tumor growth curves were generated. The protein expression of NPM1, annexin A3 and nm23-H1 was examined by immunohistochemically staining tumor tissues. NPM1 and annexin A3 protein levels were downregulated in the CNE-2R cells, whereas nm23-H1 expression was upregulated. In vivo tests showed that compared with the CNE-2 tumors, CNE-2R tumor growth was significantly retarded (P<0.05). CNE-2 tumor progression was inhibited by irradiation, but CNE-2R tumor progression was not, indicating that the CNE-2R cells were also radioresistant in vivo. NPM1 and annexin A3 expression was significantly lower in non-irradiated (NIR)-CNE-2R tumors compared with NIR-CNE-2 tumors (P<0.01). However, Nm23-H1 protein levels were significantly higher (P<0.05). Overall, the present study established comparable radioresistant and radiosensitive tumor models of human NPC, and identified candidate biomarkers that may correlate with radioresistance. The data showed that dysregulation of NPM1, annexin A3 and nm23-H1 expression correlated with the cellular and tumor radioresponse. These proteins are involved in the regulation of intracellular functions, including stress responses, cell proliferation and DNA repair. However, further clinical evaluations are required.Copyright © 2016, Spandidos Publications. All rights reserved.",Included
2898,"Effect of topical melatonin on ultraviolet radiation-induced suppression of Mantoux reactions in humans BACKGROUND: Melatonin, the central neurohormone in circadian rhythm pathways, is recognized to have a variety of immune-enhancing effects. It has previously been shown to reduce ultraviolet (UV) radiation-induced erythema in mice and in humans, but there are as yet no published studies on the effects of melatonin on UV-induced immunosuppression in humans., METHODS: We investigated the effects of topical melatonin on solar-simulated (ss) UV-induced suppression of Mantoux reactions in 16 healthy, Mantoux-positive volunteers. Melatonin (5%) and its vehicle were applied in a double-blinded manner to separate areas on the lower back, immediately after each of three consecutive daily ssUV exposures. Various sites on the back received either no irradiation or one of three-graded ssUV doses. Mantoux testing was performed at each site 24 h after the final irradiation, and assessed 72 h later using a reflectance erythema meter. In a separate group of 19 volunteers, the effect of melatonin on minimal erythema dose was assessed both visually and with an erythema meter., RESULTS: We found dose-responsive UV-induced suppression of the Mantoux response in the presence of both vehicle and melatonin; melatonin did not prevent UV-induced immunosuppression in this model. Melatonin was also found to have no effect on the minimal erythema dose., CONCLUSIONS: Melatonin conferred no protection against immune suppression or sunburn when applied topically to human skin immediately after irradiation.",Excluded
1569,"Early stage transplantation of bone marrow cells markedly ameliorates copper metabolism and restores liver function in a mouse model of Wilson disease Background: Recent studies have demonstrated that normal bone marrow (BM) cells transplantation can correct liver injury in a mouse model of Wilson disease (WD). However, it still remains unknown when BM cells transplantation should be administered. The aim of this study was to investigate the potential impact of normal BM cells transplantation at different stages of WD to correct liver injury in toxic milk (tx) mice. Method(s): Recipient tx mice were sublethally irradiated (5 Gy) prior to transplantation. The congenic wild-type (DL) BM cells labeled with CM-DiI were transplanted via caudal vein injection into tx mice at the early (2 months of age) or late stage (5 months of age) of WD. The same volume of saline or tx BM cells were injected as controls. The DL donor cell population, copper concentration, serum ceruloplasmin oxidase activity and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) levels in the various groups were evaluated at 1, 4, 8 and 12 weeks post-transplant, respectively. Result(s): The DL BM cells population was observed from 1 to 12 weeks and peaked by the 4th week in the recipient liver after transplantation. DL BM cells transplantation during the early stage significantly corrected copper accumulation, AST across the observed time points and serum ceruloplasmin oxidase activity through 8 to 12 weeks in tx mice compared with those treated with saline or tx BM cells (all P < 0.05). In contrast, BM cells transplantation during the late stage only corrected AST levels from 4 to 12 weeks post-transplant and copper accumulation at 12 weeks post-transplant (all P < 0.05). No significant difference was found between the saline and tx BM cells transplantation groups across the observed time points (P > 0.05). Conclusion(s): Early stage transplantation of normal BM cells is better than late stage transplantation in correcting liver function and copper metabolism in a mouse model of WD. © 2011 Chen et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",Excluded

Method(s): Clinical records of patients with a diagnosis of MCC and with an indication to undergo RT at the European Institute of Oncology between 2003 and 2018 were reviewed retrospectively. Result(s): Twenty-six patients were included in the analysis (median age 65 years, range 42-87). Nineteen received adjuvant RT, 4 exclusive RT, and the remainder palliative RT. Intensity-modulated RT was used in 13 cases, a 3D conformal technique in 11 cases, and stereotactic RT in 2 cases. No major toxicities were recorded. The median relapse-free survival (RFS) after adjuvant RT was 20.5 months, while for unknown primary MCC, it was 23 months. In the adjuvant setting, median polyomavirus-positive RFS was 21.5 months (range 1-49) and median polyomavirus-negative RFS was only 14 months (range 4-45). Overall, RFS of polyomavirus-positive and polyomavirus-negative patients was 10.5 and 8 months, respectively. After adjuvant RT, only 1 out of 10 patients had a recurrence in the RT field. At the time of data collection, 16 patients were alive with no evidence of disease, 1 patient was alive with advanced status of disease, 8 patients died of disease progression, and 1 patient died of other causes. Conclusion(s): The management of unknown primary and polyomavirus-positive cases, which had a better prognosis in our series, may benefit from a multidisciplinary approach, given the limited data available regarding optimal treatment.Copyright © Fondazione IRCCS Istituto Nazionale dei Tumori 2020.",Excluded

The present work describes GMP synthesis of 6-[18F]FDF in an automated synthesis unit (ASU) and dosimetry calculations to determine radiation doses in humans. GMP synthesis and dosimetry calculations are important prerequisites for first-in-human clinical studies of 6-[18F]FDF. The radiochemical synthesis of 6-[18F]FDF was optimized and adapted to an automated synthesis process using a Tracerlab FXFN ASU (GE Healthcare). Starting from 30 GBq of cyclotron-produced n.c.a. [18F]fluoride, 2.9 +/- 0.1 GBq of 6-[18F]FDF could be prepared within 50 min including HPLC purification resulting in an overall decay-corrected radiochemical yield of 14 +/- 3% (n = 11). Radiochemical purity exceeded 95%, and the specific activity was greater than 5.1 GBq/mumol. Sprague-Dawley rats were used for biodistribution experiments, and dynamic and static small animal PET experiments. Biodistribution studies served as basis for allometric extrapolation to the standard man anatomic model and normal organ-absorbed dose calculations using OLINDA/EXM software. The calculated human effective dose for 6-[18F]FDF was 0.0089 mSv/MBq. Highest organ doses with a dose equivalent of 0.0315 mSv/MBq in a humans were found in bone. Injection of 370 MBq (10 mCi) of 6-[18F]FDF results in an effective whole body radiation dose of 3.3 mSv in humans, a value comparable to that of other 18F-labeled PET radiopharmaceuticals. The optimized automated synthesis under GMP conditions, the good radiochemical yield and the favorable human radiation dosimetry estimates support application of 6-[18F]FDF in clinical trials for molecular imaging of GLUT5 in breast cancer patients.",Excluded

Moreover, we evaluated the relationship between lymphocyte activation and the observed changes in immunoregulatory functions following ECP treatments. We enrolled 19 SSc patients, who received 12 ECP treatments in total. Blood samples were taken prior to the first therapy and 6 weeks after each cycle. Samples were also obtained from 16 healthy controls. Lymphocyte subgroups were quantified by flow cytometry. Initially, patients had higher numbers and percentages of peripheral CD95+ T cells, but not CD95+ B cells, compared to control values. After ECP treatments, values of CD95+ T cells decreased and became similar to controls. Annexin V expression on T and B cells did not change during the therapy. We observed a significant negative correlation between the changes in percentages of peripheral CD95+ T cells and CD4+CD25 + Treg cells. Although neither early-activated (CD69+) nor lateactivated (HLA-DR+) T lymphocytes showed significant changes after ECP, clear negative correlations developed between them and the functional ability of CD4+CD25+ Treg cells after the last treatment. Our results indicate that the initial increase of CD95+ expression in SSc presumably reflects a physiological response to the pronounced autoimmune processes, which can be effectively attenuated by the restoration of regulative T cell numbers and functions as the result of ECP therapy. © Clinical Rheumatology 2012.",Excluded

Currently, there is no available ASCVD risk prediction tool that integrates traditional risk factors and CAC., METHODS: To develop a CAC ASCVD risk tool for younger individuals in the general population, subjects aged 40 to 65 without prior cardiovascular disease from 3 population-based cohorts were included. Cox proportional hazards models were developed incorporating age, sex, systolic blood pressure, total and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, smoking, diabetes mellitus, hypertension treatment, family history of myocardial infarction, high-sensitivity C-reactive protein, and CAC scores (Astro-CHARM model [Astronaut Cardiovascular Health and Risk Modification]) as dependent variables and ASCVD (nonfatal/fatal myocardial infarction or stroke) as the outcome. Model performance was assessed internally, and validated externally in a fourth cohort., RESULTS: The derivation study comprised 7382 individuals with a mean age 51 years, 45% women, and 55% nonwhite. The median CAC was 0 (25th, 75th [0,9]), and 304 ASCVD events occurred in a median 10.9 years of follow-up. The c-statistic was 0.784 for the risk factor model, and 0.817 for Astro-CHARM ( P<0.0001). In comparison with the risk factor model, the Astro-CHARM model resulted in integrated discrimination improvement (0.0252), and net reclassification improvement (0.121; P<0.0001), as well. The Astro-CHARM model demonstrated good discrimination (c=0.78) and calibration (Nam-D'Agostino chi2, 13.2; P=0.16) in the validation cohort (n=2057; 55 events). A mobile application and web-based tool were developed to facilitate clinical application of this tool ( www.AstroCHARM.org )., CONCLUSION: The Astro-CHARM tool is the first integrated ASCVD risk calculator to incorporate risk factors, including high-sensitivity C-reactive protein and family history, and CAC data. It improves risk prediction in comparison with traditional risk factor equations and could be useful in risk-based decision making for cardiovascular disease prevention in the middle-aged general population.",Excluded
1530,"Perfusion MRI detects rCBF abnormalities in early stages of HIV-cognitive motor complex OBJECTIVE: To evaluate patients with early HIV-cognitive motor complex (HIV-CMC) for possible regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) abnormalities on perfusion MRI (pMRI)., BACKGROUND: Nuclear medicine techniques have demonstrated global and focal cerebral perfusion abnormalities in patients with HIV dementia. Ultrafast pMRI enables the measurement of rCBF throughout the brain without the need to apply radioactive tracers or ionizing radiation., METHODS: pMRI was used to measure the rCBF in 19 patients with early stages of HIV-CMC and 15 healthy seronegative control subjects. The rCBF maps were registered to high-resolution anatomic MRI scans and transformed into Talairach space. Statistical analysis of the rCBF maps was performed with SPM96., RESULTS: Compared with the control subjects, the patients with HIV had statistically significantly decreased rCBF bilaterally in the inferior lateral frontal cortices (right: -15%, p < 0.002; left: -12%, p < 0.005) and in the inferior medial parietal brain region (-15%, p < 0.0009). In contrast, rCBF was increased bilaterally in the posterior inferior parietal white matter (right: +19%, p < 0.0001; left: + 17%, p < 0.001). Furthermore, rCBF abnormalities correlated significantly with clinical disease severity as measured by CD4 count, plasma viral load, Karnofsky score, and HIV dementia scale., DISCUSSION: Our results are consistent with previous findings from PET and SPECT studies. Furthermore, pMRI can detect rCBF abnormalities that correlate with disease severity in HIV-CMC. Because pMRI is more cost-effective, faster, and safer than nuclear medicine techniques for monitoring rCBF changes, pMRI may be more feasible for monitoring the effects of therapy for HIV-CMC.",Excluded
3393,"Relationships between ionizing radiation, bone marrow transplantation and leukemogenesis Studies of the relationships between ionizing radiation, bone marrow transplantation and leukemogenesis were carried out in 343 LACA mice. The recipients (female) were given whole-body irradiation with 7 or 8 Gy of Co-60 gamma-rays, while the donors (male) were given whole-body irradiation with 3, 1.5, 0.5, 0.1, 0.05 and 0 Gy of Co-60 gamma-rays. Each recipient was intravenously infused with 1-3 X 10(7) of the mixed marrow cells of donors. In the result, the average incidence of surviving over 1 month was 86% in the recipients. Myelocytic leukemia developed in all the transplanted groups, the average incidence being 88.5%. Leukemia was observed in 1.5-2.5 months after transplantation in the recipients receiving marrow cells from donors exposed to 3 Gy, but in 5-8 months in other groups. It was demonstrated by the analysis of Y-chromosome that the leukemic cells were derived from the donor's marrow cells. The results suggest that marrow transplantation for the mice irradiated by Co-60 gamma-rays of lethal dose can protect them from death, but promote the development of leukemia. Radiation can induce production of factors which lead to leukemic transformation of engrafted normal marrow cells in the irradiated mice; the direct damage of DNA caused by radiation is not the unique factor that gives rise to leukemia.",Excluded

Method(s): Patients aged > 70 years with untreated, measurable, LD-SCLC, performance status (PS) 0-2, and adequate organ function were eligible. Treatment consisted of induction with carboplatin on day 1 and irinotecan on days 1 and 8, every 21 days for 4 cycles, and sequential TRT (54Gy in 27 fractions). Carboplatin doses were based on AUC of 4 and 5 (levels 1 and 2, respectively), with a fixed irinotecan dose (50 mg/m2). Primary objective of the phase II study was overall responce rate. Result(s): Forty-three patients were enrolled and forty-one were finally analyzed (median age: 75 years [range 70-86 years); males 31; PS 0/1/2, n = 22/18/1]. Two patients were excluded because of protocol violation (ascertained to be extensive disease). Twelve patients were accrued at phase I and the number of patients with carboplatin dose-limiting toxicities at levels-1 (n = 6) and -2 (n = 6) were 1(grade 3 hypertension) and 2 (grade 4 thrombocytopenia), respectively. The phase II trial was expanded to 29 additional patients receiving the level 1 carboplatin dose, total of 35 patients. The median number of chemotherapy cycles was 4 (range 1-4), and the median radiation dose was 54Gy (range 36-60). Toxicities were generally mild. There were 4 complete and 27 partial responses (response rate 88.6%).

1230,"Potential welfare impacts of kill-trapping European moles (Talpa europaea) using scissor traps and Duffus traps: A Post mortem examination study Moles are widely trapped as pests on farms and amenity land in Britain. Spring traps for killing mammals generally require welfare approval in the UK, but mole traps are exempt. Previous research demonstrated wide variation in the mechanical performance of mole traps. In this context, we aimed to produce new data on the welfare impact of kill-trapping moles in the field. We collected 50 moles trapped in southern England (November 2008-August 2009). Captures peaked during the peak in male breeding activity, when captures were almost exclusively male. Post mortem and x-ray (radiation) examinations were conducted to determine injuries and likely cause of death. No moles sustained damaged skulls or upper cervical vertebrae (which could cause unconsciousness immediately). The primary identifiable cause of death for all but one mole was acute haemorrhage; this contrasts with the findings of the only previous such study, in which only one mole showed clear evidence of haemorrhaging. Some moles may have asphyxiated although it was not possible to determine this. Moles most likely became unconscious before death, but times to unconsciousness, and death, can be determined only through killing trials and further investigation is urgently needed. This should be done through the spring traps approval process; this could improve the welfare standards of trapping for many thousands of moles each year. Mole trapping for long-term population control might be better targeted after the peak in male breeding activity, when females are more likely to be caught, but this would threaten the welfare of dependent young underground.Copyright © 2015 Universities Federation for Animal Welfare.",Excluded

At 6.5 years after the RT, the patient showed no evidence of recurrence. Definitive RT resulted in excellent disease control and minimal toxicity; thus, it could be a promising nonsurgical therapeutic option for penoscrotal EMPD, even in extremely elderly individuals.Copyright © The Author(s) 2021.",Excluded
465,"Lack of correlation between basal cell survival and gross response in irradiated swine skin The relationship between basal cell survival and gross response in irradiated swine skin was tested by comparing dose survival curves derived from time-dose isoeffect data with curves obtained directly from basal cell counts in histological sections. Assuming equal effect per exposure and constant cell survival at isoeffect, best-fitting single-hit multi-target and linear-quadratic response curves were determined for time-dose schedules resulting in non-healing of 50% of irradiated fields. Basal cell survivals for single doses of 970, 1649, 2231, and 2619 rad were estimated 1) by counting regenerating islands and 2) by monitoring total basal cell counts through time. The dose survival curve derived from the isoeffect data was steeper than the curve obtained from direct basal cell counts. Furthermore, the direct basal cell survival curve extrapolates to less than 100% at zero dose, indicating the presence of a resistant basal cell subpopulation. The data show that the isoeffect in this case is not strongly coupled to basal cell survival. Rather, the probability of healing of an irradiated field is more sensitive to the dose per fraction than is basal cell survival, implying a contribution to non-healing from damage to stromal elements such as the capillary endothelium.",Included
1980,"Diagnostic medical imaging radiation exposure and risk of development of solid and hematologic malignancy Limiting patients' exposure to ionizing radiation during diagnostic imaging is of concern to patients and clinicians. Large single-dose exposures and cumulative exposures to ionizing radiation have been associated with solid tumors and hematologic malignancy. Although these associations have been a driving force in minimizing patients' exposure, significant risks are found when diagnoses are missed and subsequent treatment is withheld. Therefore, based on epidemiologic data obtained after nuclear and occupational exposures, dose exposure limits have been estimated. A recent collaborative effort between the US Food and Drug Administration and the American College of Radiology has provided information and tools that patients and imaging professionals can use to avoid unnecessary ionizing radiation scans and ensure use of the lowest feasible radiation dose necessary for studies. Further collaboration, research, and development should focus on producing technological advances that minimize individual study exposures and duplicate studies. This article outlines the research used to govern safe radiation doses, defines recent initiatives in decreasing radiation exposure, and provides orthopedic surgeons with techniques that may help decrease radiation exposure in their daily practice.

2502,"The role of adjuvant radiotherapy in the local management of desmoplastic melanoma BACKGROUND In the current study, the authors sought to evaluate outcomes, specifically with respect to adjuvant radiotherapy (RT), for patients with desmoplastic melanoma. METHODS The records of 130 consecutive patients who presented between 1985 and 2009 with nonmetastatic desmoplastic melanoma and were treated curatively with either surgery alone (59 patients; 45%) or surgery and postoperative RT (71 patients; 55%) were retrospectively reviewed. Ages ranged from 21 years to 97 years (median age, 66 years). The location of the primary tumor was in the head and neck region in 62% of patients. Only 5 patients (4%) had lymph node involvement at the time of presentation. RESULTS The median follow-up was 6.6 years (range, 11 months-24 years). Overall survival rates at 5 years and 10 years were 69% and 53%, respectively. Disease-specific survival rates were 84% and 80%, respectively, at 5 years and 10 years. The actuarial rate of local recurrence was 17% at 5 years and beyond. Of the patients who underwent surgery without receiving postoperative RT, 14 (24%) experienced local recurrence. Of the 71 patients treated with surgery and postoperative RT, 5 (7%) experienced local recurrence. In a Cox multivariate regression model, improved local control was significantly associated with the receipt of postoperative RT (P = .009). CONCLUSIONS Surgery followed by postoperative RT appears to provide superior local control compared with surgery alone for patients with desmoplastic melanoma.

2982,"Sequence variants in cell cycle control pathway, X-ray exposure, and lung cancer risk: a multicenter case-control study in Central Europe Exposure to ionizing radiation (IR) results in various types of DNA damage and is a suspected cause of lung cancer. An essential cellular machinery against DNA damage is cell cycle control, which is regulated by several genes, including TP53, CCND1, and CDKN2A. Therefore, we hypothesized that the genetic variants in these three genes influence the predisposition of lung cancer (i.e., CCND1 G870A, CDKN2A Ala(148)Thr, TP53 Arg(72)Pro, and 16-bp repeat in intron 3) and that the effect of X-ray on lung cancer risk can be modified by the presence of these genetic variations. The study was conducted in 15 centers in 6 countries of Central Europe between 1998 and 2002. A total of 2,238 cases and 2,289 controls were recruited and provided DNA samples. Cases with positive family history were analyzed separately. The joint effect of X-ray and previous risk genotypes was assessed, and modification by sequence variants on X-ray dose-response relationship with lung cancer risk was evaluated. We found an overall effect of TP53 intron 3 16-bp repeats [odds ratio (OR), 1.99; 95% confidence interval (95% CI), 1.27-3.13], which was stronger among cases with family history of lung cancer (OR, 2.98; 95% CI, 1.29-6.87). In addition, our results suggested an interaction that was greater than multiplicativity between TP53 intron 3 16-bp repeats and multiple X-ray exposures (interaction OR, 5.69; 95% CI, 1.33-24.3). We did not observe a main effect of CCND1 G870A polymorphism; however, the dose-response relationship between lung cancer risk and X-ray exposures was modified by CCND1 genotype with no risk from X-ray exposures among subjects who carried G/G genotype, intermediate risk [trend OR for X-ray, 1.16; 95% CI, 1.05-1.27) among subjects with G/A genotype, and highest risk [trend OR for X-ray, 1.29; 95% CI, 1.12-1.49) among subjects with A/A genotype. Sequence variants in cell cycle control pathway may increase the risk of lung cancer and modify the risk conferred by multiple X-ray exposures. However, a definite conclusion can only be drawn on replication by different studies among individuals who are highly exposed to IR.",Included

288,"Patient effective radiation dose and associated risk from transmission scans using 153Gd line sources in cardiac SPECT studies The aim of the present study was to determine the contribution of transmission measurements acquisition to total patient effective dose from cardiac SPECT studies. A dual-head L-shaped gamma camera equipped with a transmission scan acquisition system based on two 153Gd line sources was used to simulate transmission measurements acquisition exposure on an anthropomorphic phantom. Thermoluminescence dosimeters were used to directly monitor the dose to 550 measuring points in the phantom. The effective dose and associated risk from transmission scans acquisition were estimated and compared to those associated to the radiopharmaceutical injected. The maximum effective dose from a typical transmission measurements acquisition was 1.3 muSv and 1.9 muSv for male and female patients, respectively. The contribution of the typical transmission scans acquisition to total patient radiation risk from a cardiac SPECT study is less than 10-3. Thus, radiation exposure may not be considered as a limiting factor for the clinical application of attenuation correction methods based on transmission measurements in cardiac SPECT.",Excluded
1053,"Variant Splicing and Influence of Ionizing Radiation on Human Endogenous Retrovirus K (HERV-K) Transcripts in Cancer Cell Lines Human endogenous retrovirus K (HERV-K) is the most intact retrovirus in the human genome. There are multiple full-length or near full-length HERV-K proviruses in it. To analyze which HERV-K proviruses give rise to viral transcripts in cancer cell lines and to test whether ionizing radiation can alter the levels of HERV-K transcripts, RT-PCR studies were undertaken using multiple human cancer cell lines. Primers from several positions in the viral genome were used and included pairs designed to cross splice junctions in viral RNAs. In the absence of ionizing radiation, transcripts were detected from multiple HERV-K proviruses in cell lines from human prostate, cervical, head and neck, or breast cancers, and the proviruses from which the transcripts originated varied among the different lines. Only one of 13 cell lines tested (cervical cancer line C33A) failed to show HERV-K transcripts. Spliced RNAs detected included viral RNAs spliced as expected at the conventional viral splice sites, plus several alternatively spliced RNAs. Alternatively spliced transcripts arose from specific proviruses, and were detected in most of the cell lines used. Quantitative RT-PCR was performed to assess the effects of ionizing radiation. These analyses showed that HERV-K transcripts were elevated in four of twelve lines tested, specifically all three prostate cancer lines used and one breast cancer line. The increases were transient, peaking at 24 hours following a single dose of gamma-irradiation that ranged from 2.5 to 20 Gy, and returning to baseline levels by 72 hours. In summary, these studies showed that ionizing radiation can affect the levels of HERV-K transcripts in cells, and these effects vary among different cells. The changes in HERV-K transcript levels might affect multiple biological processes in cells, and future studies of the effects of ionizing radiation on HERV-K are worth pursuing. © 2013 Agoni et al.",Excluded
879,"Radiation exposure in total ankle replacement BACKGROUND: Radiation exposure from diagnostic imaging procedures is associated with increased cancer risk. No published data currently exist regarding ionizing radiation exposure in total ankle replacement surgery. This study quantified intraoperative fluoroscopic dose and duration during ankle replacement surgery and examined patient and technical factors affecting the level of exposure., METHODS: Fifty-five patients underwent ankle replacement using STAR, Salto-Talaris, or INBONE total ankles. Intraoperative fluoroscopic dose and duration, patient demographics, implant design, and accompanying additional procedures were documented for each case. The relationship between each relevant variable and radiation dose and time was determined., RESULTS: The mean fluoroscopic dose and duration for all cases were 1.15 +/- 0.84 milliGray per case and 77 +/- 34 seconds per case, respectively. There was a positive correlation between the absorbed radiation dose and the duration of fluoroscopy (r = .50, P < .001). The mean fluoroscopic doses were 1.53 milliGray, 0.99 milliGray, and 0.88 milliGray for INBONE, STAR, and Salto-Talaris prostheses, respectively. Fluoroscopic dose was significantly influenced by implant design (P = .035), with implants using an intramedullary referencing guide associated with higher radiation doses. After excluding cases requiring additional procedures, the fluoroscopic time and radiation dose associated with intramedullary referencing guide implants continued to exceed those of the other implants, but the differences were no longer statistically significant (P = .22, P = .09, respectively)., CONCLUSION: The average patient radiation dose during total ankle replacement was approximately one-fifth the recommended maximum yearly radiation exposure. The radiation dose was positively associated with fluoroscopy duration. Among factors controllable by the surgeon, selection of an implant with an extramedullary alignment system and conscious effort to minimize duration of fluoroscopy can reduce harmful radiation exposure and decrease cancer risk in total ankle replacement patients and associated operating room personnel., LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Level III, comparative series.

3600,"Antegrade wire escalation for chronic total occlusions in coronary arteries: Simple algorithms as a key to success Aims: Antegrade wire escalation (AWE) remains the method of choice for tackling chronic total occlusions (CTOs), especially for lesions with low J-CTO score. To increase the number of operators which treat CTOs and increase AWE success rates, there is a need for a clear, algorithmic approach. We report the results of a simple AWE algorithm with new guidewire technology in coronary CTOs. Method(s): Hundred consecutive CTO lesions selected for AWE as the primary strategy were included in five Benelux centers. The algorithm follows a step-wise increase in guidewire tip load. Lesions were categorized according to the J-CTO score. Primary endpoint was successful guidewire crossing. Result(s): No differences in baseline demographics were present between successful and unsuccessful procedures. Overall, in 75% of the lesions AWE resulted in successful crossing. AWE success rates in easy, intermediate, difficult and very difficult CTOs were 83, 86, 71 and 43%, respectively. 46% could be crossed using a soft guidewire only. An additional success of 34 and 60% could be reached with an intermediate and stiff guidewire, respectively. Adding additional techniques resulted in 88% overall success. Procedure and fluoroscopy times, radiation doses and use of contrast were within highly acceptable ranges (67+/-39min, 27+/-19min, 1.7+/-1.3 Gy, 264+/-123ml). Conclusion(s): The algorithm and new wire technologies led to high success rates. AWE as a standalone procedure is highly successful in J-CTO 0-1. Low- and intermediatevolume CTO operators should try to implement a systematic approach in their CTO procedures, especially for lesions with low J-CTO scores. Adding additional techniques further increases these success rates.© Copyright 2016 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc. All rights reserved.",Excluded
942,"Assessing the Association Between Electrical Stimulation Dose, Subsequent Cognitive Function and Depression Severity in Patients Receiving Bilateral Electroconvulsive Therapy for Major Depressive Disorder OBJECTIVE: To assess the relationship between electrical stimulation administered to patients undergoing bilateral electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) and subsequent measures of cognitive function and depression severity., METHODS: Stimulus dose titrated patients receiving bilateral ECT were assessed with the Cambridge Neuropsychological Test Automated Battery (CANTAB) Spatial Recognition Memory test and Montgomery Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) at baseline, after 4 ECT treatments and on course completion. Changes in CANTAB and MADRS scores were assessed in relation to electrical dosage, initial stimulus dose, and demographic variables using linear mixed models., RESULTS: Data pertained to 143 patients (mean age, 56.85 [SD, 14.94], 43% male). Median change in CANTAB score was -10% (-20% to 5%) after 4 ECT treatments and -10% (-20% to 5%) at course completion. Median change in MADRS score was -22 (-33 to -13) after 4 ECT treatments and -14 (-25 to -7) at course completion. Electrical dosage had no effect on CANTAB or MADRS change scores either after 4 treatments or course completion. Improvement in CANTAB score at end of course was associated with female sex (P < 0.05), higher intelligence quotient (P = 0.01), and age. After 4 treatments, improvement in CANTAB score was associated with younger age (P < 0.001) and higher intelligence quotient (P < 0.01). Improved MADRS score at course completion was associated with older age (P < 0.001 at end of course and after 4 treatments)., CONCLUSIONS: Electroconvulsive therapy has significant antidepressant and cognitive effects which are not associated with the total electrical dose administered. Other, unalterable variables, such as age and sex, have an influence on these effects.",Excluded
3096,"Standard dose and dose-escalated radiation therapy are associated with favorable survival in select elderly patients with newly diagnosed glioblastoma We hypothesized elderly patients with good Karnofsky Performance Status (KPS) treated with standard dose or dose-escalated radiation therapy (SDRT/DERT) and concurrent temozolomide (TMZ) would have favorable overall survival (OS) compared to historical elderly patients treated with hypofractionated RT (HFRT). From 2004 to 2015, 66 patients age >= 60 with newly diagnosed, pathologically proven glioblastoma were treated with SDRT/DERT over 30 fractions with concurrent/adjuvant TMZ at a single institution. Kaplan-Meier methods and the log-rank test were used to assess OS and progression-free survival (PFS). Multivariate analysis (MVA) was performed using Cox Proportional-Hazards. Median follow-up was 12.6 months. Doses ranged from 60 to 81 Gy (median 66). Median KPS was 90 (range 60-100) and median age was 67 years (range 60-81), with 29 patients >= 70 years old. 32% underwent gross total resection (GTR). MGMT status was known in 28%, 42% of whom were methylated. Median PFS was 8.3 months (95% CI 6.9-11.0) and OS was 12.7 months (95% CI 9.7-14.1). Patients age >= 70 with KPS >= 90 had a median OS of 12.4 months. Median OS was 27.1 months for MGMT methylated patients. On MVA controlling for age, dose, KPS, MGMT, GTR, and adjuvant TMZ, younger age (HR 0.9, 95% CI 0.8-0.9, p < 0.01), MGMT methylation (HR:0.2, 95% CI 0.1-0.7, p = 0.01), and GTR (HR:0.5, 95% CI 0.3-0.9, p = 0.01) were associated with improved OS. Our findings do not support routine use of a standard 6-week course of radiation therapy in elderly patients with glioblastoma. However, a select group of elderly patients with excellent performance status and MGMT methylation or GTR may experience favorable survival with a standard 6-week course of treatment.",Excluded
3441,"Usefulness of dual-source computed tomography for the evaluation of coronary arteries in heart transplant recipients BACKGROUND: Heart transplant recipients require serial assessment of coronary arteries due to a risk of cardiac allograft vasculopathy or atherosclerosis. Currently available non-invasive imaging methods are of a limited value for the detection of coronary stenoses, and thus invasive coronary angiography (ICA) is recommended., AIM: We evaluated diagnostic accuracy and clinical usefulness of dual-source computed tomography (DSCT) as a potential alternative to ICA for the detection of coronary stenoses., METHODS: DSCT was performed in 20 consecutive heart transplant recipients (15 males, mean age 47.5 years) who were scheduled for ICA. Exclusion criteria included renal dysfunction with creatinine clearance <45 mL/min and lack of patient consent. All examinations were performed using a first generation dual-source scanner and a retrospectively ECG-gated protocol. Data sets were routinely reconstructed in best-systolic and best-diastolic phases. We evaluated presence of a >50% stenosis in a vessel with a diameter of >1.0 mm, image quality of each segment, and radiation dose delivered to the patient. Sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values, and diagnostic accuracy were calculated in per segment, per vessel, and per patient analyses, with ICA considered the reference method., RESULTS: All DSCT and ICA examinations were diagnostic and performed without any complications. Mean heart rate was 85 bpm (range 63-114), and was stable in 85% of patients. Significant stenoses (>50%) were diagnosed by DSCT in 4 of the 287 segments, and these findings were confirmed by ICA in 2 segments. Sensitivity, specificity, and diagnostic accuracy were: (1) in the per segment analysis, 100%, 99%, and 99%, respectively, for the left coronary artery; and 100% each for the right coronary artery; (2) 100%, 97%, and 97%, respectively, in the per vessel analysis; and (3) 100%, 94%, 95%, respectively, in the per patient analysis. In diastolic reconstructions, right coronary segments were significantly more commonly nondiagnostic than left coronary segments (25% vs. 11.5%, p = 0.003). In contrast, right coronary segments showed better quality than left coronary segments in systolic reconstructions (63.5% vs. 42.2%, p <0.001). Mean effective radiation dose was 12.7 (range 5.4-18.7) mSv., CONCLUSIONS: DSCT is a clinically useful alternative to invasive coronary angiography for excluding significant coronary stenoses in heart transplant recipients. The negative predictive value of this modality is very high. Sensitivity, specificity and diagnostic accuracy is acceptably high. Imaging of coronary arteries in patients with high heart rates in technically feasible, but require modifications of routine exam protocol. Using of modern prospectively ECG-triggered protocols is not reccommended.",Excluded

Patients treated with or without predilation were compared. Procedure times decreased from 85.6+/-42.9 to 56.7+/-26.1 minutes (p<0.001), fluoroscopy times from 9.5+/-5.7 to 6.2+/-3.9 minutes (p<0.001) and contrast volume from 131.9+/-60.8 to 85.4+/-37.4 ml (p<0.001) without predilation. Intraprocedural CPR was significantly more frequent in the predilation group (5.3% vs. 1.4%, p=0.01). Stroke rate was low at 1.5% and with no detectable difference. Applying VARC-2 definitions, the combined endpoints device success (88.3% vs. 92.4%, p=0.07) and clinical efficacy (88.7% vs. 92.4%, p=0.11) were comparable with or without prior valvuloplasty, while early safety was less frequent with predilation (85.2% vs. 90.2%, p=0.04). At 30 days, all-cause mortality and cardiovascular mortality were 6.8% with predilation vs. 2.9% without predilation (p=0.03) and 5.3% vs. 1.4% (p=0.01)., CONCLUSIONS: TAVI without prior valvuloplasty is feasible without apparent adverse impact in patients receiving a balloon-expandable TAVI prosthesis.

Patients received either cream 1 (the natural oil-based emulsion containing allantoin) or cream 2 (aqueous cream). Skin toxicity, pain, itching, and skin-related quality of life scores were collected for up to 4 weeks after radiation treatment., Results: Patients who received cream 1 had a significantly lower average level of Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events at week 3 (P<.05) but had statistically higher average levels of skin toxicity at weeks 7, 8, and 9 (all P<.001). Similar results were observed when skin toxicity was analyzed by grades. With regards to pain, patients in the cream 2 group had a significantly higher average level of worst pain (P<.05) and itching (P=.046) compared with the cream 1 group at week 3; however, these differences were not observed at other weeks. In addition, there was a strong trend for cream 2 to reduce the incidence of grade 2 or more skin toxicity in comparison with cream 1 (P=.056). Overall, more participants in the cream 1 group were required to use another topical treatment at weeks 8 (P=.049) and 9 (P=.01)., Conclusion: The natural oil-based emulsion containing allantoin seems to have similar effects for managing skin toxicity compared with aqueous cream up to week 5; however, it becomes significantly less effective at later weeks into the radiation treatment and beyond treatment completion (week 6 and beyond). There were no major differences in pain, itching, and skin-related quality of life. In light of these results, clinicians and patients can base their decision on costs and preferences. Overall, aqueous cream seems to be a more preferred option.Copyright © 2014 Elsevier Inc.",Excluded

Eighty-seven patients were classified according to the extent of the lesion (grades), and the cure rates were calculated according to the RT modality, the grade, and the treatment method for ORN., RESULTS: : The later ORN developed and the higher the dose of irradiation, particularly among the patients who received external RT, the more it progressed. The initial cure rates for conservative management, marginal, and segmental mandibulectomy were 39.7%, 50%, and 86.7%, respectively., CONCLUSIONS: : Conservative management should be limited to early-onset ORN after brachytherapy with or without a low dose of external irradiation. Marginal mandibulectomy is appropriate for the late-onset ORN after brachytherapy with or without low-dose external irradiation.

1386,"Evidence for variation in human radiosensitivity and its potential impact on radiological protection Radiological protection standards generally assume that all members of the population are equally sensitive to the adverse health effects associated with radiation exposure, recognising the age- and sex-related differences in sensitivity to radiation-induced cancer. It has become very clear over recent years that genetic and lifestyle factors can play important roles in the susceptibility of individuals to a range of diseases; as such, the same may apply to radiation-associated diseases. Evidence is accumulating from studies at many levels of biological organisation - cells, experimental organisms, and humans - that a range of radiosensitivity exists between individuals in the population. Consideration of improvements in radiological protection practices to take account of such differences will require the availability of robust and accurate ways to assess the sensitivity of an individual or population subgroup. In addition, there will need to be careful consideration of the ethical aspects relating to use of individual sensitivity information. These ethical considerations are very likely to be exposure context dependent, and require careful risk-benefit balance consideration before practical application.

1698,"Dynamic CT for Parathyroid Adenoma Detection: How Does Radiation Dose Compare With Nuclear Medicine? OBJECTIVE: Dynamic CT is increasingly used for preoperative localization of parathyroid adenomas, but concerns remain about the radiation effective dose of CT compared with that of 99mTc-sestamibi scintigraphy. The purpose of this study was to compare the radiation dose delivered by three-phase dynamic CT with that delivered by 99mTc-sestamibi SPECT/CT performed in accordance with our current protocols and to assess the possible reduction in effective dose achieved by decreasing the scan length (i.e., z-axis) of two phases of the dynamic CT protocol., MATERIALS AND METHODS: The effective dose of a 99mTc-sestamibi nuclear medicine parathyroid study performed with and without coregistration CT was calculated and compared with the effective dose of our current three-phase dynamic CT protocol as well as a proposed protocol involving CT with reduced scan length., RESULTS: The median effective dose for a 99mTc-sestamibi nuclear medicine study was 5.6 mSv. This increased to 12.4 mSv with the addition of coregistration CT, which is higher than the median effective dose of 9.3 mSv associated with the dynamic CT protocol. Reducing the scan length of two phases in the dynamic CT protocol could reduce the median effective dose to 6.1 mSv, which would be similar to that of the dose from the 99mTc-sestamibi study alone., CONCLUSION: Dynamic CT used for the detection of parathyroid adenoma can deliver a lower radiation dose than 99mTc-sestamibi SPECT/CT. It may be possible to reduce the dose further by decreasing the scan length of two of the phases, although whether this has an impact on accuracy of the localization needs further investigation.",Excluded

In all subjects the heart rate (HR) was <65 bpm and all CT scans were acquired using a prospective ECG gating and AEC strategy. Mean effective radiation dose and subjective and objective (Noise or N, signal to noise ratio or SNR, contrast to noise ratio or CNR) image quality, were evaluated. Subjective quality was assessed by two experienced radiologists using a 5-point scale (0: non diagnostic-4: excellent) using the 15-segment American Heart Association (AHA) coronary artery classification., RESULTS: Mean effective dose and noise were non significantly different between the two groups: mean effective dose was 2.89 +/- 0.7 mSv in the 100 kV group and 2.80 +/- 0.57 mSv in the 120 kV group (p = 0.25) while noise was 28.9 +/- 3.3 in the 120 kV group and 29.05 +/- 3.6 in the 100 kV group (p = 0.72). Both SNR and CNR were significantly higher in the 100 kV group than in the 120 kV group. This data agrees with the evidence that subjective quality was significantly higher in the 100 kV group in the middle and distal segmental classes., CONCLUSION: Our study shows that, in using a 320 row CCTA with AEC strategy it is better to employ a 100 kV tube voltage protocol because compared to 120 kV tube voltage setting, it appears to significantly improve both subjective and objective image quality without decreasing the mean effective radiation dose.",Excluded

Five patients subsequently developed intrahepatic recurrence outside the irradiation field and two had extrahepatic metastasis. Five patients died of hepatocellular carcinoma. No acute adverse events of grade >=2 were observed. Two patients experienced grade 2 or 3 late adverse events, including obstructive jaundice, hepatic encephalopathy, ascites, and edema. Conclusion(s): Carbon ion radiotherapy for HCCCL achieved excellent local control with acceptable adverse events and can thus be a curative treatment option for HCCCL.Copyright © 2020 The Japan Society of Hepatology",Excluded
753,"Postoperative chemoradiotherapy in gastric cancer-a phase I-II study of radiotherapy with dose escalation of weekly cisplatin and daily capecitabine chemotherapy Background: Postoperative chemoradiotherapy with concurrent 5-fluorouracil improves gastric cancer outcome. We previously demonstrated that chemoradiotherapy with a more intensified-and therefore potentially more effective-schedule with daily cisplatin and oral capecitabine is feasible. Because such an intensive schedule requires an extensive logistic infrastructure which is not available in every hospital, we additionally investigated the tolerability of this combined regimen with weekly instead of daily cisplatin in a dose-escalation study. Patients and Methods: After R0 or R1 resection, treatment initiated with capecitabine 1000 mg/m2 b.i.d. for 2 weeks and 1-week rest. Subsequently, patients received capecitabine (575-650 mg/m2 orally b.i.d., 5 days/week) and cisplatin (20-25 mg/m2 i.v., once weekly) according to a predefined dose-escalation schedule concurrent with radiation. Radiotherapy was given to a fixed total dose of 45 Gy in 25 fractions. Result(s): Thirty-one patients were eligible and started treatment. During chemoradiotherapy, seven patients developed 10 items of grade III and one episode of grade IV (mainly hematological) toxicity (National Cancer Institute-Common Toxicity Criteria version 3.0). The maximum tolerable dose was determined to be for cisplatin 20 mg/m2 i.v. weekly and for capecitabine 575 mg/m2 b.i.d. orally. Conclusion(s): This phase I-II study demonstrated that postoperative chemoradiotherapy with weekly cisplatin and daily capecitabine is feasible in gastric cancer at the defined dose level.

1176,"Are navigation techniques risk-benefit effective for vertebral transpedicular instrumentation? A prospective comparative study BACKGROUND CONTEXT: Pedicle screw malposition is very common and may cause neurological, vascular and visceral injuries and compromise mechanical stability. Image-guided surgical techniques have reduced the risk of serious complications and have improved the mechanical stability of pedicle screws. PURPOSE: The purpose of this study is to compare the malposition rate between intraoperative navigation and free-hand fluoroscopy-guided techniques for placement of pedicle screw instrumentation. STUDY DESIGN/SETTING: Prospective observational study. PATIENT SAMPLE: All consecutive patients with degenerative disease (degenerative disc disease, listhesis, scoliosis, lumbar stenosis), with instrumentation between T10 and S1, who underwent surgical procedures using the free-hand or intraoperative navigation technique for placement of transpedicular instrumentation were included in the study. METHOD(S): Radiological analysis of the position of the transpedicular screws was performed usisng a 1-mm spinal CT scan. Evaluation of axial slices as well as sagittal and coronal reconstructions were carried out. Analysis of screw position was assessed using the Heary classification. Breach severity was defined according to the Gertzbein classification. Radiation doses were evaluated usisng thermoluminiscent dosimeter (TLD) and estimates of effective dose and organ dose were made based on the scan technical parameters. RESULT(S): A total of 114 patients were included; 58 were operated on using assisted surgery and 56 using free-hand fluoroscopy-guided surgery. A total of 625 screws were implanted (575 below L3 and 50 between T10 and L2): 52% in the navigation-assisted surgery group and 48% in the free-hand surgery group. The total number of malpositioned screws was: 11 (3.6%) in the navigated surgery group (right side: n=7, left side: n=4) and 33 (10.3%) in the free-hand group (right side: n=23, left side: n=10) (p<.001). Screw position according to the Heary scale was: grade II (4 navigated surgery, 6 fluoroscopy guided), grade III (3 navigated surgery, 11 fluoroscopy guided), grade IV (4 navigated surgery, 15 fluoroscopy guided) and grade V (1 fluoroscopy guided). There was only one symptomatic case in the fluoroscopy guided group. Breach severity was as follows: 7 grade A and 4 grade B in the navigated surgery group and 8 grade A, 24 grade B and 1 breach >4 mm grade C in free-hand fluoroscopy-guided group. The radiation received per patient was 5.8 mSv (4.8-7.3). The mean dose received by patients in the free-hand fluoroscopy group was 1 mGy (0.8-1.1). There was no detectable radiation level in the navigation-assisted surgery group whereas the effective dose was 10microGy in the free-hand fluoroscopy-guided surgery group. CONCLUSION(S): The malposition rate, both, symptomatic and asymptomatic, in spinal surgery is reduced when using navigation assisted transpedicular intrumentation compared to placement under fluoroscopic guidance, with radiation values within the safety limits for health. Larger studies, specially in levels above L1, which are the ones that may benefit most from navigated surgery are needed to determine risk-benefit in these patients.",Excluded

1857,"Retrospective assessment of self-reported exposure to medical ionizing radiation: results of a feasibility study conducted in Germany BACKGROUND: Exposure to medical ionizing radiation has been increasing over the past decades and constitutes the largest contributor to overall radiation exposure in the general population. While occupational exposures are generally monitored by national radiation protection agencies, individual data on medical radiation exposure for the general public are not regularly collected. The aim of this study was to determine the feasibility of assessing lifetime medical ionizing radiation exposure from diagnostic and therapeutic procedures retrospectively and prospectively within the framework of the German National Cohort study., METHODS: Retrospective assessment of individual medical radiation exposure was done using an interviewer-based questionnaire among 199 participants (87 men and 112 women) aged 20-69 randomly drawn from the general population at two recruitment locations in Germany. X-ray cards were distributed to 97 participants at one recruitment center to prospectively collect medical radiation exposure over a 6-month period. The Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney test was used to test differences in self-reported median examination frequencies for the variables age, sex, and recruitment center. To evaluate the self-reported information on radiological procedures, agreement was assessed using health insurance data as gold standard for the time period 2005 to 2010 from 8 participants., RESULTS: Participants reported a median of 7 lifetime X-ray examinations (interquartile range 4-13), and 42% (n = 83) reported having had a CT scan (2, IQR = 1-3). Women reported statistically significant more X-ray examinations than men. Individual frequencies above the 75th percentile (>=15 X-ray examinations) were predominantly observed among women and in individuals >50 years of age. The prospective exposure assessment yielded a 60% return-rate of X-ray cards (n = 58). 16 (28%) of the returned cards reported radiological examinations conducted during the 6-month period but generally lacked more detailed exposure information. X-ray examinations reported for the period for which health insurance data were available provided a moderately valid measure of individual medical radiation exposure., CONCLUSIONS: The assessment of more recent medical examinations seems in the German National Cohort study feasible, whereas lifetime medical radiation exposure appears difficult to assess via self-reports. Health insurance data may be a potentially useful tool for the assessment of individual data on medical radiation exposure both retrospectively and prospectively.",Excluded
3384,"Contrast harmonic imaging ultrasound and perfusion imaging for surveillance after endovascular abdominal aneurysm repair regarding detection and characterization of suspected endoleaks OBJECTIVE: Is Contrast Harmonic Imaging (CHI) comparable to computed tomography angiography (CTA) scan in detecting and characterizing suspected endoleaks after endovascular abdominal aneurysm repair in a non-selected group including reintervention procedure and branched endografts in daily practice?, MATERIAL/METHODS: In a prospective study computed tomography angiography (CTA) and contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) were performed in 30 consecutive patients (26 males, 4 females, mean age: 72 years, range: 38-87) with suspected endoleaks in follow-up (mean 13 months, range: 1-95) after endovascular abdominal aneurysm repair or procedure in dissection or penetrated ulcer of the aorta (25 infrarenal, 5 suprarenal stent grafts, mean aortic diameter 56 mm, range: 27-98). CTA was supposed to be gold standard for determining the presence of endoleaks (multislice CT, collimation 16 x 0.75 mm, 100 ml of iodized contrast agent bolus). Ultrasonography used a multi-frequency probe (1-4 MHz) with the modalities of colour coded Doppler sonography (CCDS), power Doppler (PD) combined with contrast enhancement and the technique of contrast harmonic imaging (CHI) and low mechanical index (MI < 0.2). 2.4 ml of SonoVue (Bracco, Altana Pharma GmbH, Italy) were administered to each patient intravenously as a bolus injection., RESULTS: Out of 30 patients, 21 endoleaks were identified in CTA (6 type I or III, 15 type II), 22 in CHI. Thus, sensitivity for CHI was therefore 99%, its specificity 85% (Spearman correlation coefficient (CC) 0.92). In follow-up the localizations of endoleak type I or III exclusively detected by CHI were confirmed as true positive by angiography. Due to its dynamic characteristic CHI seemed to be more helpful in characterization of endoleaks than CTA. In case of a rupture after reintervention a type III endoleak leads to prompt intervention before receiving the result of the CT scan. Altogether, CHI failed to identify 1 combined type I and II endoleak (sensitivity 0.99). Both, CCDS and PD were positive only in 6/30 patients (CC 0.33 and 0.39). Interestingly the application of contrast agent doubles the detection rate of endoleaks (12/30) in CCDS and PD (CC 0.39)., CONCLUSION: Contrast harmonic imaging (CHI) compared to computed tomography angiography (CTA) accurately depicts endoleaks after endovascular abdominal aneurysm repair and stent-graft procedure in dissected and ulcerated aorta. It seems to be superior in characterization of the type of endoleaks and can be established in order to reduce iodized contrast agent and radiation exposure in follow-up. In contrast to CTA scan CHI can be offered to patients with chronic renal insufficiency and allows a dynamic examination and a perfusion analysis.",Excluded

Anderson Hospital, Houston, from August 1981 through July 1982. Four causes were documented: plexopathy secondary to metastatic disease (six cases); radiation-induced plexopathy (two cases); plexopathy secondary to intra-arterial chemotherapy (two cases); and plexopathy as the result of a second primary tumor (one case). Patients with plexopathies secondary to tumor or irradiation complained of pain in the ipsilateral lower extremity. Computed tomography of the pelvis was the most accurate method of documenting tumor in the region of the lumbosacral plexus. Radiation therapy records of patients with cervical carcinoma were reviewed with respect to positioning of intracavitary radium, which was thought to be responsible for the development of radiation-induced plexopathies.

300,"Estimation of radiation exposure of retrospective gated and prospective triggered 128-slice triple-rule-out CT angiography CT has become an important role in the differential diagnosis of acute chest pain to exclude an aortic dissection, pulmonary embolism and acute coronary artery syndrome. However, the additional radiation exposure is a cause of concern and dose saving strategies should be applied, if possible. To estimate effective dose of retrospective gated and prospective ECG-triggered triple-rule-out computed tomography angiography (TRO-CTA). An Alderson-Rando-phantom equipped with thermoluminescent dosimeters was used for dose measurements. Exposure was performed on a 128-slice single source scanner. The following scan parameters were used (retrospective ECG-gated): 120 kV, 190 mAs/rot., collimation 128x0.6 mm, rotation time 0.3 s. Protocols with a simulated heart rate (HR) of 60 and 100 bpm were performed using the standard ECG-pulsing as well as MinDose. Additionally, a prospective triggered TRO-CTA was acquired (HR 60 bpm). The estimated effective dose of retrospective ECG-gated TRO-CTA ranged from 7.4-13.4 mSv and from 10.1-17.5 mSv for men and women, respectively. Due to radiosensitive breast tissue, women received a significant increased effective dose of up to 64.7% +/- 0.03% (p = 0.028) compared to men. MinDose reduces radiation exposure of up to 33.0% +/- 6.5% in comparison to standard ECG-pulsing (p < 0.001). The effective dose increased significantly with lower heart rates (p < 0.001). Prospective ECG-triggered TRO-CTA showed an effective dose of 5.9 mSv and 8.2 mSv for men and women, respectively. Compared to retrospective ECG-gated TRO-CTA a significant dose reduction was observed (p < 0.001). Due to the significant different dose exposure, scan protocols should be specifically adapted in a patient- and problem-oriented manner.",Excluded
2556,"Kinetic Imaging in Lower Extremity Arteriography: Comparison to Digital Subtraction Angiography Purpose To compare the image quality produced by kinetic imaging in x-ray angiography and the current reference standard digital subtraction angiography (DSA).

Signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs) of DSA and kinetic image pairs were compared. Visual quality comparisons were also performed by specialists who used an online questionnaire. Interrater agreement was characterized by percent agreement and Fleiss k. Results A total of 1902 regions of interest were carefully selected in 110 image pairs to calculate and compare the SNRs. Median SNR in raw kinetic images was 3.3-fold and 2.3-fold higher than raw and postprocessed DSA images, respectively. A total of 232 pairs of raw and postprocessed kinetic images were compared. It was indicated that postprocessing improved the quality of kinetic images in 63.9% (2668 of 4176) of the comparisons. Interrater agreement was 75% and Fleiss k was 0.12 (P < .001). Also, 238 pairs of kinetic and DSA images were compared. Kinetic imaging was judged to have provided higher quality images than DSA in 69.0% (2462 of 3570) of the comparisons. The interrater agreement was 81% and Fleiss k was 0.17 (P < .001). Conclusion Kinetic imaging helps to view the same structures as digital subtraction angiography but offers better image quality. The improved signal-to-noise ratio suggests that this approach could reduce radiation exposure and improve the ability to view smaller vessels. © RSNA, 2018 Online supplemental material is available for this article.",Excluded
3513,"Feasibility of ultra-low dose CT for bronchoscopy of peripheral lung lesions Background and Objective: Three dimensional (3D) thin-section airway CT is essential for identification of small peripheral bronchi during bronchoscopy using radial endobronchial ultrasound. We performed a retrospective study to identify the optimal radiation dose for 3D airway CT during peripheral bronchoscopy. Method(s): In total, 91 patients with peripheral lung lesions underwent 3D airway CT (both standard dose CT as a reference and ultra-low dose CT [LDCT]). The patients were randomly assigned to one of four groups according to the ultra-LDCT parameters: group 1 = 120 kVp, 25 mAs; group 2 = 100 kVp, 15 mAs; group 3 = 120 kVp, 5 mAs; and group 4 = 100 kVp, 5 mAs. Two radiologists and two pulmonary physicians analyzed both the standard CT and ultra-LDCT scans independently. Result(s): The effective doses (EDs) of ultra-LDCT significantly differed among the four groups (median EDs were 0.88, 0.34, 0.19, and 0.12 mSv for groups 1-4, respectively; P < 0.001). Median differences in peripheral airway wall thickness were higher in group 4 than in other groups. Bronchus signs on ultra-LDCT in groups 1 and 2 were well correlated with those of the standard dose CT (accuracies of two radiologists and two pulmonary physicians were 95-100%) Conclusion(s): Our results indicate that ultra-LDCT with ED of > 0.34 mSv (ED of group 2) is feasible for peripheral bronchoscopy.",Excluded
1263,"Collaborative exercise on the use of FISH chromosome painting for retrospective biodosimetry of Mayak nuclear-industrial personnel PURPOSE: To investigate within the framework of a multilaboratory study the suitability of FISH chromosome painting to measure so-called stable translocations in peripheral lymphocytes of Mayak nuclear-industrial workers (from the Southern Urals) and their use for retrospective biodosimetry., MATERIALS AND METHODS: Chromosime analyses were carried out from 69 workers who had received protracted occupational radiation exposures (0.012-6.065 Gy) up to approximately 40 years before blood sampling. Twenty-one unexposed people living in the same area were controls. A multicolour FISH-painting protocol with the target chromosomes 1, 4 and 8 simultaneously with a pancentromeric probe was used to score potentially transmissible chromosome-type aberrations (reciprocal translocations 2B and related 'one-way' patterns I-III according to the S&S classification)., RESULTS: Individual biodosimetry estimates were obtained in terms of these potentially long-term surviving aberration types based on the linear component of a low dose-rate gamma-ray calibration curve produced using identical staining and scoring protocols. For comparison, the workers personal and total background doses were converted to red bone marrow doses. The estimated doses were mainly lower than would be predicted by the calibration curve, particularly at accumulated higher dose levels., CONCLUSIONS: Owing to the limited life-time of circulating T-lymphocytes, the long-term persistence of translocations in vivo requires the assumption of a clonal repopulation of these naturally senescing cells from the haemopoietic stem cell compartments. Obviously such a replacement cannot be fully achieved, leading to a temporal decline even of the yield of transmissible aberrations types. Assuming further a highly selective capacity of stem cells against any type of chromosomal damage and the fact that one must rely on partial genome findings, the potential of FISH chromosome painting for retrospective dose reconstruction is probably limited to a decade or so after high-level protracted radiation exposure.",Included
1374,"CT follow-up in patients with neuroendocrine tumors (NETs): combined radiation and contrast dose reduction Background Frequent computed tomography (CT) follow-ups involve significant radiation related risks for patients with low-grade neuroendocrine tumors (NETs). Contrast agent (CA) application is essential for diagnostic evidence and has additional risks especially in patients with limited renal function. Purpose To investigate if a combination of dose and contrast agent (CA) reduction affects image quality and diagnostic evidence in neuroendocrine tumor (NET) patients. Material and Methods A total of 51 NET patients were enrolled in the study and 153 CT scans were analyzed. Patients underwent a baseline CT scan (A = 120 kVp, filtered back projection [FBP]) and two follow-up CTs (B = 120 kVp, adaptive statistical iterative reconstruction [ASIR] 40%; C1 = 100 kVp, ASIR 40%; C2 = 100 kVp, ASIR 60%; the latter two protocols were applied with a 30% reduction in CA volume). We evaluated image quality and applied dose. Results In C1/2, the combination of low kV (100 kVp) with ASIR 40%/60% reduced the mean applied dose significantly by 28% compared to B and by 57% compared to A. Signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and contrast-to-noise ratios (CNR) of tumor to liver/muscle were significantly increased by using C1/2 compared to B and A. With respect to subjective image quality, a slight loss of diagnostic confidence in C1 could be counterbalanced by the higher ASIR blending in C2. Conclusion Combined dose reduction techniques can be used to reduce radiation dose and CA volume without sacrificing image quality and diagnostic confidence in staging CT of NET patients.",Excluded

51,"Effects of different gamma exposure regimes on reproduction in the earthworm Eisenia fetida (Oligochaeta) Ecological risk assessment of ionising radiation requires knowledge about the responses of individuals and populations to chronic exposures, including situations when exposure levels change over time. The present study investigated processes such as recovery and the adaptive response with respect to reproduction endpoints in the earthworm Eisenia fetida exposed to (60)Co gamma-radiation. Furthermore, a crossed experiment was performed to investigate the influence of F0 parental and F1 embryonic irradiation history on the response of irradiated or non-irradiated F1 offspring. Recovery: The sterility induced by sub-chronic exposure at 17 m Gy/h (accumulated dose: 25 Gy) was temporary, and 8 weeks after irradiation the worms had regained their reproductive capacity (number of viable offspring produced per adult per week). Adaptive response: Adult worms were continuously exposed at a low priming dose rate of 0.14 mGy/h for 12 weeks (accumulated dose: 0.24 Gy), followed by 14 weeks exposure at a challenge dose rate of 11 mGy/h. The results suggest a lack of adaptive response, since there were no significant differences in the effects on reproduction capacity between the primed and the unprimed groups after challenge doses ranging from 7.6 to 27 Gy. Crossed experiment: The effects of exposure at 11 mGy/h for 21 weeks on growth, sexual maturation and reproduction of offspring, derived either from parent worms and cocoons both exposed at 11 mGy/h, or from non-irradiated parents and cocoons (total accumulated dose 44 and 38 Gy, respectively) were compared. There were no significant differences between the two exposed offspring groups for any of the endpoints. The reproduction capacity was very low for both groups compared to the controls, but the reproduction seemed to be maintained at the reduced level, which could indicate acclimatisation or stabilisation. Finally, parental and embryonic exposures at 11 mGy/h did not affect reproduction in the F1 offspring as adults. Copyright © 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",Excluded

3156,"Comparing outcomes of stereotactic body radiotherapy with intensity-modulated radiotherapy for patients with locally advanced unresectable pancreatic cancer OBJECTIVES: Survival in patients with locally advanced unresectable pancreatic cancer (LAUPC) is poor, and local recurrence continues to be a major problem in the management of this disease. Radiotherapy (RT) using different RT techniques, including intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) and stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT), may lead to different clinical outcomes for patients with LAUPC. Here, we compared SBRT with IMRT for patients with LAUPC with respect to survival rate, local control (LC) rate, and toxicity-related dose distribution. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This retrospective study from March 2007 to March 2011 included 41 patients with LAUPC who were divided into two groups, with 20 patients receiving SBRT and 21 patients receiving IMRT. The median follow-up time was 16 months. RESULT(S): For the IMRT and SBRT groups, the median survival times were 13 and 20 months, and 1-year overall survival (OS) rates were 70.7 and 80.0%, respectively. There was no difference in OS between the two RT techniques. RT with SBRT showed significantly better local disease-free survival than IMRT for patients with LAUPC. Tobacco use had a borderline effect on LC. Thus, further statistical analysis showed that patients who used tobacco had better LC after receiving SBRT than IMRT. CONCLUSION(S): SBRT improved LC for LAUPC patients and had similar radiation toxicity compared with IMRT. Further study is required to define the effects of administered radiation dose and fractionation, as well as to further expand the sample size, to use a prospective study, and to observe the long-term efficacy of these techniques..Copyright © 2015 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

810,"MR-guided breast radiotherapy: feasibility and magnetic-field impact on skin dose The UMC Utrecht MRI/linac (MRL) design provides image guidance with high soft-tissue contrast, directly during radiotherapy (RT). Breast cancer patients are a potential group to benefit from better guidance in the MRL. However, due to the electron return effect, the skin dose can be increased in presence of a magnetic field. Since large skin areas are generally involved in breast RT, the purpose of this study is to investigate the effects on the skin dose, for whole-breast irradiation (WBI) and accelerated partial-breast irradiation (APBI). In ten patients with early-stage breast cancer, targets and organs at risk (OARs) were delineated on postoperative CT scans co-registered with MRI. The OARs included the skin, comprising the first 5 mm of ipsilateral-breast tissue, plus extensions. Three intensity-modulated RT techniques were considered (2x WBI, 1x APBI). Individual beam geometries were used for all patients. Specially developed MRL treatment-planning software was used. Acceptable plans were generated for 0 T, 0.35 T and 1.5 T, using a class solution. The skin dose was augmented in WBI in the presence of a magnetic field, which is a potential drawback, whereas in APBI the induced effects were negligible. This opens possibilities for developing MR-guided partial-breast treatments in the MRL.",Excluded
2892,"Comparison of I-131 radioimmunotherapy tumor dosimetry: Unit density sphere model versus patient-specific monte carlo calculations High computational requirements restrict the use of Monte Carlo algorithms for dose estimation in a clinical setting, despite the fact that they are considered more accurate than traditional methods. The goal of this study was to compare mean tumor absorbed dose estimates using the unit density sphere model incorporated in OLINDA with previously reported dose estimates from Monte Carlo simulations using the dose planning method (DPMMC) particle transport algorithm. The dataset (57 tumors, 19 lymphoma patients who underwent SPECT/CT imaging during I-131 radioimmunotherapy) included tumors of varying size, shape, and contrast. OLINDA calculations were first carried out using the baseline tumor volume and residence time from SPECT/CT imaging during 6 days post-tracer and 8 days post-therapy. Next, the OLINDA calculation was split over multiple time periods and summed to get the total dose, which accounted for the changes in tumor size. Results from the second calculation were compared with results determined by coupling SPECT/CT images with DPM Monte Carlo algorithms. Results from the OLINDA calculation accounting for changes in tumor size were almost always higher (median 22%, range-1%-68%) than the results from OLINDA using the baseline tumor volume because of tumor shrinkage. There was good agreement (median-5%, range-13%-2%) between the OLINDA results and the self-dose component from Monte Carlo calculations, indicating that tumor shape effects are a minor source of error when using the sphere model. However, because the sphere model ignores cross-irradiation, the OLINDA calculation significantly underestimated (median 14%, range 2%-31%) the total tumor absorbed dose compared with Monte Carlo. These results show that when the quantity of interest is the mean tumor absorbed dose, the unit density sphere model is a practical alternative to Monte Carlo for some applications. For applications requiring higher accuracy, computer-intensive Monte Carlo calculation is needed. © 2011, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.",Excluded
2694,"Comparison of the effectiveness of MRI perfusion and fluorine-18 FDG PET-CT for differentiating radiation injury from viable brain tumor: a preliminary retrospective analysis with pathologic correlation in all patients OBJECTIVES: Differentiating radiation injury from viable tumor is important for optimizing patient care. Our aim was to directly compare the effectiveness of fluorine-18 fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) positron emission tomography-computed tomography (PET-CT) and dynamic susceptibility-weighted contrast-enhanced (DSC) magnetic resonance (MR) perfusion in differentiating radiation effects from tumor growth in patients with increased enhancement following radiotherapy for primary or secondary brain tumors., MATERIALS AND METHODS: We retrospectively identified 12 consecutive patients with primary and secondary brain tumors over a 1-year period that demonstrated indeterminate enhancing lesions after radiotherapy and that had undergone DSC MR perfusion, FDG PET-CT, and subsequent histopathologic diagnosis. The maximum standardized uptake value (SUV) of the lesion (SUVlesion max), SUVratio (SUVlesion max/SUVnormal brain), maximum relative cerebral blood volume, percentage of signal intensity recovery, and relative peak height were calculated from the positron emission tomography and MR perfusion studies. A prediction of tumor or radiation injury was made based on these variables while being blinded to the results of the surgical pathology., RESULTS: SUVratio had the highest predictive value (area under the curve=0.943) for tumor progression, although this was not statistically better than any MR perfusion metric (area under the curve=0.757-0.829)., CONCLUSIONS: This preliminary study suggests that FDG PET-CT and DSC MR perfusion may demonstrate similar effectiveness for distinguishing tumor growth from radiation injury. Assessment of the SUVratio may increase the sensitivity and specificity of FDG PET-CT for differentiating tumor and radiation injury. Further analysis is needed to help define which modality has greater predictive capabilities. Copyright © 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.",Excluded
557,"[Influence of Professional Contact with Plutonium-239 on Indicators of the Immune Status of the Personnel at Siberian Chemical Plant] The results of the examination and monitoring of the personnel at the Siberian Chemical Plant (SChP) and adult population of Seversk are presented. The results of primary examination of the personnel who professionally contact the ionizing radiation (IR) from external sources and incorporated 239Pu showed that clinical symptoms of dysfunction of the immune system manifested themselves with a frequency of 75.30%. Infectious-inflammatory diseases (46.95%) and the combined pathology of infectious and allergic character (20.12%) were the most widespread. The allergic diseases (AD) without manifestations of an infectious component were observed not often (7.62%). The monitoring which was carried out for 10 years revealed a decrease in a percentage of persons with clinical signs of disorders of the immune system up to 60.68% among the personnel at the Chemical-Steel Plant and even more among the whole group of the studied personnel at SChP--49.68% (389 : 783). Among the population their frequency made up 51.78%. Features of clinical manifestations of dysfunction ofthe immune system depending on accumulation of 239Pu in the organism are established. Similar dynamics of infectious and infectious and allergic syndromes is revealed when the activity of 239Pu is 40 nCi. AD frequency reliably increased .when the activity of 239Pu is 20 nCi, but if accumulation is higher than 20-40 nCi it decreases and again increases when the activity is over 40 nCi. Pathologies of infectious and allergic genesis are most often observed when the content of 239Pu in an organism is over 40 nCi. Indicators of the immune status (IS) of the personnel at SChP with incorporated 239Pu are analyzed. 59 people--carriers of 239Pu and 408 people without 239Pu accumulated in an organism are examined. In comparison with the control, IS indicators characteristic for all dose loading groups are revealed: increase of lymphocytes, existence of dissociation in indicators of relative and absolute values of the T-cellular link, CD16+56+(-) NK-cells and B-lymphocytes with increase of absolute values, decrease in markers of activation of HLA-DR+ and CD95+, increase of B-lymphocytes and low level of serum IgM. Features of IS in comparison with the group of the personnel with the absence of 239Pu in an organism and indicators of IS which depend on the activity of 239Pu are established. Among them are a decrease in the percentage of persons with increased number of lymphocytes with increased beam loading; increase of NK-T-cells when the activity of 239Pu is 10-20 nCi and the highest value at doses over40 nCi; the dynamics of CD16+56(+)-lymphocytes with the increase of the contents and a percentage of persons with the increase of the activity above 40 nCi; the highest frequenc of a regulatory imbalance with high frequency decrease of CD8(+)-T-lymphocytes at the content of 239Pu > 0-10 nCi; decrease in indicators of B-lymphocytes and serum IgA with an increase in the activity of 239Pu with the lowest values under internal radiation over 40 nCi; decrease in the percentage of persons with a weakening expression of HLA-DR+ with the increase in dose loading.",Included
2591,"Ionizing radiation causes a dose-dependent release of transforming growth factor alpha in vitro from irradiated xenografts and during palliative treatment of hormone-refractory prostate carcinoma PURPOSE: Characterize the radiation response for transforming growth factor (TGF) alpha shedding in vitro and in vivo. We also report the shedding of TGF alpha by patients undergoing irradiation for hormone-refractory prostate cancer., EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: TGF alpha levels were determined by ELISA. DU145 xenografts were established on the flanks of athymic nu/nu mice. Expression of phospho-extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK)1/2 and phospho-epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and the DNA repair proteins XRCC1 and ERCC1 were determined by Western analyses., RESULTS: Exposure to ionizing radiation results in a dose-dependent release of TGF alpha. Once released, TGF alpha stimulates EGFR-ERK1/2 signaling in unirradiated cells. Blockade of the EGFR with the tyrphostin AG1478 eliminates the up-regulation XRCC1 and ERCC1 by TGF alpha or irradiation. After irradiation, cells are refractory to additional transactivation of EGFR by additional irradiation for 8 to 12 hours. Irradiation during this refractory period does not increase the expression of XRCC1 or ERCC1. Ligand activation of EGFR is maintained during the refractory period. Irradiation of DU145 xenografts also results in the activation of ERK1/2, release of TGF alpha, and a similar refractory period. Ionizing irradiation also results in the release of TGF alpha for patients undergoing radiation therapy for hormone-refractory prostate cancer., CONCLUSIONS: Irradiation results in a dose-dependent increase in TGF alpha capable of enhancing the growth of DU145 xenografts. TGF alpha is also shed following radiation therapy of patients treated for hormone-refractory prostate cancer. Radiation transactivation of the EGFR produces a radio-refractory period, which lasts for several hours. During this period, additional irradiation fails to induce XRCC1, ERCC1, or additional TGF alpha release.",Included
3336,"Three-dimensional scanless holographic optogenetics with temporal focusing (3D-SHOT) Optical methods capable of manipulating neural activity with cellular resolution and millisecond precision in three dimensions will accelerate the pace of neuroscience research. Existing approaches for targeting individual neurons, however, fall short of these requirements. Here we present a new multiphoton photo-excitation method, termed three-dimensional scanless holographic optogenetics with temporal focusing (3D-SHOT), which allows precise, simultaneous photo-activation of arbitrary sets of neurons anywhere within the addressable volume of a microscope. This technique uses point-cloud holography to place multiple copies of a temporally focused disc matching the dimensions of a neuron's cell body. Experiments in cultured cells, brain slices, and in living mice demonstrate single-neuron spatial resolution even when optically targeting randomly distributed groups of neurons in 3D. This approach opens new avenues for mapping and manipulating neural circuits, allowing a real-time, cellular resolution interface to the brain.",Excluded
2316,"Hybrid resistance to parental bone marrow grafts in nonlethally irradiated mice Resistance to parental bone marrow (BM) grafts in F1 hybrid recipients is due to natural killer (NK) cell-mediated rejection triggered through ""missing self"" recognition. ""Hybrid resistance"" has usually been investigated in lethally irradiated F1 recipients in conjunction with pharmacological activation of NK cells. Here, we investigated BM-directed NK-cell alloreactivity in settings of reduced conditioning. Nonlethally irradiated (1-3 Gy) or nonirradiated F1 (C57BL6 x BALB/c) recipient mice received titrated doses (5-20 x 106) of unseparated parental BALB/c BM without pharmacological NK cell activation. BM successfully engrafted in all mice and multilineage donor chimerism persisted long-term (24 weeks), even in the absence of irradiation. Chimerism was associated with the rearrangement of the NK-cell receptor repertoire suggestive of reduced reactivity to BALB/c. Chimerism levels were lower after transplantation with parental BALB/c than with syngeneic F1 BM, indicating partial NK-mediated rejection of parental BM. Activation of NK cells with polyinosinic-polycytidylic acid sodium salt poly(I:C), reduced parental chimerism in nonirradiated BM recipients but did not prevent hematopoietic stem cell engraftment. In contrast, equal numbers of parental lymph node cells were completely rejected. Hence, hybrid resistance leads to incomplete rejection of parental BM under reduced conditioning settings.Copyright © 2018 The Authors American Journal of Transplantation published by Wiley Periodicals, Inc. on behalf of The American Society of Transplantation and the American Society of Transplant Surgeons",Excluded
1653,"CyberKnife radiosurgery for breast cancer spine metastases: A matched-pair analysis BACKGROUND. There are few options for breast cancer patients with spinal metastases recurrent within a previous radiation treatment field. CyberKnife radiosurgery has been used in our institution to treat such patients. To evaluate their outcomes, as there are no comparable radiation treatment options, the outcomes were compared between 18 patients with spinal metastases from breast cancer treated with CyberKnife stereotactic radiosurgery, 17 of which had prior radiotherapy to the involved spinal region and were progressing, and 18 matched patients who received conventional external beam radiotherapy (CRT) up-front for spinal metastases. METHODS. Radiosurgery was delivered in 3 to 5 fractions to doses ranging from 2100 to 2800 cGy. Women were matched to patients in a CRT group with respect to time from original diagnosis to diagnosis of metastases, estrogen receptor / progesterone receptor (ER/PR) status, presence or absence of visceral metastases, prior radiotherapy, and prior chemotherapy. Survival and complications were compared between treatment groups. Surviving patients were followed out to 24 months. RESULTS. The CyberKnife and CRT groups were comparable along all matching dimensions and in performance status before treatment. Outcomes of treatment were similar for patients in both groups; ambulation, performance status, and pain worsened similarly across groups posttreatment. Survival and the number of complications appeared to favor the CyberKnife group, but the differences did not reach statistical significance. CONCLUSIONS. The statistical comparability of the CyberKnife and CRT groups reflects the small sample size and stringent requirements for significance of the matched-pair analysis. Nevertheless, comparability in these difficult cases shows that salvage CyberKnife treatment is as efficacious as initial CRT without added toxicity. © 2007 American Cancer Society.",Excluded
2472,"Demonstration of Human Fetal Bone Morphology with MR Imaging: A Preliminary Study PURPOSE: CT is a useful modality for the evaluation of fetal skeletal dysplasia but radiation exposure is unavoidable. The purpose of this study is to compare the usefulness of MRI and CT for evaluating the fetal skeletal shape., METHODS: This study was approved by our Institutional Review Board. Fetal specimens (n = 14) were scanned on a 3T MRI scanner using our newly-developed sequence. It is based on T2*-weighted imaging (TR, 12 ms; TE for opposed-phase imaging, 6.1 ms, for in-phase imaging, 7.3 ms; flip angle, 40degree). The specimens were also scanned on a 320 detector-row CT scanner. Four radiologists visually graded and compared the visibility of the bone shape of eight regions on MRI- and CT-scans using a 5-point grading system., RESULTS: The diagnostic ability of MRI with respect to the 5th metacarpals, femur, fibula, and pelvis was superior to CT (all, P < 0.050); there was no significant difference in the evaluation results of observers with respect to the cervical and lumbar spine, and the 5th metatarsal (0.058 <= P <= 1.000). However, the diagnostic ability of MRI was significantly inferior to CT for the assessment of the bone shape of the thoracic spine (observers A and C: P = 0.002, observers B and D: P = 0.001)., CONCLUSION: The MRI method we developed represents a potential alternative to CT imaging for the evaluation of the fetal bone structure.",Excluded
1233,"Self-generated lower body negative pressure exercise Background: Exercise during spaceflight helps prevent musculoskeletal and cardiovascular deconditioning to Earth gravity. This report evaluates the aerobic and anaerobic exercise stimulus provided by self-generated lower body negative pressure. Method(s): A lower body negative pressure cylinder expands and collapses longitudinally, but not radially. As the legs push footward to expand the cylinder, the air pressure in the cylinder decreases, increasing the force required to continue expanding the cylinder. In addition, valves control air flow into and out of the cylinder, and thus workload. In seven supine subjects, knee bend exercise was performed at 19 cycles per minute for 6 min. Footward force was measured with load cells, cylinder pressure with a transducer, heart rate from ECG, and oxygen consumption with turbine volumetry and gas analysis. Result(s): Maximum footward force at the peak of the exercise cycle averaged 1120 +/- 88 N (114 +/- 9 kg), and pressure within the cylinder concomitantly decreased 26 +/- 3 mmHg below ambient. Heart rate and oxygen consumption increased 75 +/- 4 bpm and 26.3 +/- 1.4 m O2/kg . min-1 from supine resting values, respectively. Conclusion(s): With the air inlet valve nearly closed, exercise with this device approximates a resistance-type leg press. With more inflow of air, more rapid, aerobic knee bends can be performed. This exercise device/concept provides simultaneous dynamic musculoskeletal and cardiovascular stresses without an external power source.",Excluded
2223,"Are low ultraviolet B and vitamin D associated with higher incidence of multiple myeloma? Background The purpose of this study was to determine whether an inverse association exists between latitude, solar ultraviolet B (UVB) irradiance, and incidence rates of multiple myeloma.Methods Associations of latitude and UVB irradiance with age-standardized incidence rates of multiple myeloma were analyzed for 175 countries while controlling for sex-specific obesity prevalence, cigarette consumption, and alcohol consumption using multiple linear regression.Results Incidence rates of multiple myeloma were greater at higher latitudes (R2 for latitude for males = 0.31, p < 0.0001; females R2 = 0.27, p < 0.0001). In regression models for males (R2 = 0.62, p < 0.0001) and females (R2 = 0.51, p < 0.0001), UVB irradiance was independently inversely associated with incidence rates.Conclusions Age-adjusted incidence rates of multiple myeloma were higher in countries with lower solar UVB irradiance.

2037,"GUCY2C signaling opposes the acute radiation-induced GI syndrome High doses of ionizing radiation induce acute damage to epithelial cells of the gastrointestinal (GI) tract, mediating toxicities restricting the therapeutic efficacy of radiation in cancer and morbidity and mortality in nuclear disasters. No approved prophylaxis or therapy exists for these toxicities, in part reflecting an incomplete understanding of mechanisms contributing to the acute radiation-induced GI syndrome (RIGS). Guanylate cyclase C (GUCY2C) and its hormones guanylin and uroguanylin have recently emerged as one paracrine axis defending intestinal mucosal integrity against mutational, chemical, and inflammatory injury. Here, we reveal a role for the GUCY2C paracrine axis in compensatory mechanisms opposing RIGS. Eliminating GUCY2C signaling exacerbated RIGS, amplifying radiation-induced mortality, weight loss, mucosal bleeding, debilitation, and intestinal dysfunction. Durable expression of GUCY2C, guanylin, and uroguanylin mRNA and protein by intestinal epithelial cells was preserved following lethal irradiation inducing RIGS. Oral delivery of the heat-stable enterotoxin (ST), an exogenous GUCY2C ligand, opposed RIGS, a process requiring p53 activation mediated by dissociation from MDM2. In turn, p53 activation prevented cell death by selectively limiting mitotic catastrophe, but not apoptosis. These studies reveal a role for the GUCY2C paracrine hormone axis as a novel compensatory mechanism opposing RIGS, and they highlight the potential of oral GUCY2C agonists (Linzess; Trulance) to prevent and treat RIGS in cancer therapy and nuclear disasters.Copyright ©2017 AACR.",Excluded

Until now, there is not standard of first line therapy, in particular, discussed the efficacy of different chemotherapy regimens and feasibility of radiation therapy. The risk of developing secondary tumors and cardiopulmonary complications, on the one hand, and extremely poor prognosis in the case of relapse, on the other hand, do highly relevant research in this area. Method(s): We identified 86 pts with PMBCL treated in N.N. Blokhin Russian Cancer Research Center during last 10 years (2004-2014). The median age was 29 years (15-63), 56% were female, 62% had I/ IIE stages, LDH elevated in 81% pts.

381,"Molecular model T6: C60 bulk-heterojunction solar cells Organic photovoltaic devices offer a large technological potential as a renewable source of electrical energy because of their low cost and ease of processing. For the last few years, the interest in such devices has grown rapidly, allowing multiplication of the solar conversion efficiency by 5 within about 10 years. The highest conversion efficiency obtained is now close to 5% with a spin-coated polythiophene-fullerene blend. For a better understanding of those polymer blend systems, we have fabricated a coevaporated solar cell from model molecules. The molecular blend was composed of sexithiophene (, -dihexylsexithiophene, T6) as a donor and fullerene C60 as an acceptor. The influence of the T6: C60 proportion was studied for an active layer of 100 nm thickness. The conversion efficiency obtained with the optimal proportion of T6: C60 (40-60) is 0.7%. Reverse bias annealing effect was studied by measuring the current-voltage characteristics after each postprocessing step. The conversion efficiency reached 1% but still remained much less than for the polymer bulk heterojunction. This major difference may come from the spontaneous phase separation which takes place in polymers to form an interpenetrated network. 2006 American Vacuum Society.",Excluded
735,"Waiting times for radiotherapy: variation over time and between cancer networks in southeast England The aim of this study was to investigate variations in the length of time that patients with cancer wait from diagnosis to treatment with radiotherapy.

In total, 12 sites were identified for which a substantial number or proportion of patients received radiotherapy: head and neck, oesophagus, colon, rectum, lung, nonmelanoma skin cancer, breast, uterus, prostate, bladder, brain and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. Median waiting times from diagnosis to radiotherapy were calculated, together with the proportion of patients who received radiotherapy within 60 days of diagnosis, and analysed by year of diagnosis, cancer site, deprivation quintile, age at diagnosis, sex and cancer network of either residence or treatment. Logistic regression was used to adjust the proportion receiving treatment within 60 days for the effects of the other factors. There were significant differences in the proportions receiving radiotherapy within 60 days between different networks and different cancer sites, which remained after adjustment. Median waiting times varied from 42 to 65 days across networks of residence, with the adjusted proportion treated within 60 days ranging from 44 to 71%. There was no difference between male and female patients after adjustment for the other factors, particularly site. There was a highly significant trend over time: the median wait increased from 45 days in 1992 to 76 days in 2001, while the adjusted proportion being treated within 60 days declined by almost a half, from 64 to 35%, over the same period.",Excluded

We carried out a propensity score-matched analysis to compare locoregional control (LRC).
PATIENTS AND METHODS: VATS lobectomy data from six hospitals were retrospectively accessed; SABR data were obtained from a single institution database. Patients were matched using propensity scores based on cTNM stage, age, gender, Charlson comorbidity score, lung function and performance score. Eighty-six VATS and 527 SABR patients were matched blinded to outcome (1:1 ratio, caliper distance 0.025). Locoregional failure was defined as recurrence in/adjacent to the planning target volume/surgical margins, ipsilateral hilum or mediastinum. Recurrences were either biopsy-confirmed or had to be PET-positive and reviewed by a tumor board.
RESULTS: The matched cohort consisted of 64 SABR and 64 VATS patients with the median follow-up of 30 and 16 months, respectively. Post-SABR LRC rates were superior at 1 and 3 years (96.8% and 93.3% versus 86.9% and 82.6%, respectively, P = 0.04). Distant recurrences and overall survival (OS) were not significantly different.
CONCLUSION: This retrospective analysis found a superior LRC after SABR compared with VATS lobectomy, but OS did not differ. Our findings support the need to compare both treatments in a randomized, controlled trial.",Included
207,"Effects of curcumin based PDT on the viability and the organization of actin in melanotic (A375) and amelanotic melanoma (C32) - in vitro studies Curcumin is a turmeric, antioxidative compound, well-known of its anti-cancer properties. Nowadays more and more effort is made in the field of enhancing the efficiency of the anticancer therapies. Combining the photoactive properties of curcumin with the superficial localization of melanoma and photodynamic therapy (PDT) seems to be a promising treatment method. The research focused on the evaluation of the curcumin effectiveness as an anticancer therapeutic agent in the in vitro treatment of melanotic (A375) and amelanotic (C32) melanoma cell lines. Keratinocytes (HaCat) and fibroblasts (HGF) were used to assess the impact of the therapy on the skin tissue. The aim of the study was to investigate the cell death after exposure to light irradiation after preincubation with curcumin. Additionaly the authors analized the interactions between curcumin and the actin cytoskeleton. The cytotoxic effect initiated by curcumin and increased by irradiation confirm the usefulness of the flavonoid in the PDT approach. Depending on curcumin concentration and incubation time, melanoma cells survival rate ranged from: 93.68 % (C32 cell line, 10 muM, 24 h) and 83.47 % (A375 cell line, 10 muM, 24 h) to 8.98 % (C32 cell line, 50 muM, 48 h) and 12.42 % (A375 cell line, 50 muM, 48 h). Moreover, photodynamic therapy with curcumin increased the number of apoptotic and necrotic cells in comparison to incubation with curcumin without irradiation. The study demonstrated that PDT induced caspase-3 overexpression and DNA cleavage in the studied cell lines. The cells revealed decreased proliferation after the therapy due to the actin cytoskeleton rearrangement. Although effective, the therapy remains not selective towards melanoma cells.

To the authors' knowledge, the question of whether RTOG-0129 overall survival (OS) estimates for low-risk, intermediate-risk, and high-risk groups are similar in other data sets or applicable to progression-free survival (PFS) is unknown. Therefore, the authors evaluated whether survival differences between RTOG-0129 risk groups persist at 5 years, are reproducible in an independent clinical trial, and are applicable to PFS, and whether toxicities differ across risk groups. Method(s): Prospective randomized clinical trials were analyzed retrospectively. RTOG-0129 evaluated standard versus accelerated fractionation radiotherapy concurrent with cisplatin. RTOG-0522 compared the combination of cisplatin and accelerated fractionation with or without cetuximab. Patients with OPC with available p16 status and tobacco history were eligible. Result(s): There was a total of 260 patients and 287 patients, respectively, from RTOG-0129 and RTOG-0522, with median follow-ups for surviving patients of 7.9 years (range, 1.7-9.9 years) and 4.7 years (range, 0.1-7.0 years), respectively. Previous OS differences in RTOG-0129 persisted at 5 years. In RTOG-0522, the 5-year OS rates for the low-risk, intermediate-risk, and high-risk groups were 88.1%, 69.9%, and 45.1%, respectively (P for trend, <.001). The 5-year PFS rates for the same 3 groups were 72.9%, 56.1%, and 42.2%, respectively. In RTOG-0522 among a subgroup of patients considered to be at very good risk (p16-positive disease, smoking history of <=10 pack-years, and classified with T1-T2 disease with ipsilateral lymph nodes measuring <=6 cm or T3 disease without contralateral or >6 cm lymph nodes), the 5-year OS and PFS rates were 93.8% and 82.2%, respectively. Overall rates of acute and late toxicities were similar by risk group. Conclusion(s): RTOG-0129 risk groups persisted at 5 years and were reproducible in RTOG-0522. However, there was variability in the estimates. These data underscore the importance of long-term follow-up and appropriate patient selection in therapeutic deintensification trials.Copyright © 2019 American Cancer Society",Excluded

In this study, we report on intra-fraction motion measured by acquisition of multiple images of 3D body surfaces., MATERIALS AND METHODS: Twenty-nine patients treated for pelvic tumors were enrolled. Setup variations (SV) through three consecutive body surfaces acquired by the optical IGRT system Align-RT (Vision-RT, London, UK) were analyzed before, during and at the end of treatment delivery. Displacements along the main axes (X, Y and Z) from initial (I) to mid-treatment (MT) and final (F) acquisitions were recorded. Time and direction of SV were assessed., RESULTS: A total of 6272 images from 792 fractions of 29 patients were available. The main source of misalignment was between I and MT acquisition (p < 0.001). The dominant SV direction was the vertical one (Z axis), with mean SV of -1.20 +/- 0.06 mm and -1.55 +/- 0.06 mm for I-MT and I-F acquisitions, respectively. The Y mean components of SV were, respectively, -0.95 +/- 0.10 mm and -1.0 +/- 0.10 for I-MT and I-F acquisitions, while the X deviations were 0.07 +/- 0.08 mm for I-MT and 0.26 +/- 0.08 mm I-F., CONCLUSION: Three-D surface imaging for patient setup monitoring highlighted remarkable mobility of patients during RT session, especially in the anterior-posterior direction (Z axis). The largest magnitude in patient movements occurred during the first part of delivery.

3273,"Improvement and induction property of radiation-responsive promoter through DNA shuffling of 5'-flanking regions of the human p21 gene A promoter that augments gene expression in response to stimulation of ionizing radiation would be a desired tool for radiogenetic therapy, a combination of radiotherapy and gene therapy. Although various promoters occurring naturally or artificially have been used for researches, one showing higher reactivity to ionizing radiation is desirable. In the present study, we attempted to improve a radiation-responsive promoter of the p21 through a technique called DNA shuffling. A library of DNA fragments was constructed by re-ligation of randomly digested promoter fragments and improved promoters were chosen out of the library. We repeated this process twice to obtain a promoter showing 2.6-fold better reactivity to ionizing radiation compared with its parent, p21 promoter after 10 Gy gamma-ray irradiation. Nucleotide sequence analyses revealed that the obtained promoter was densely packed with some of the cis-acting elements including binding sites for p53, NF-kappaB, NRF-2, AP-1 and NF-Y more than p21 promoter. In addition, it was shown that its induction by ionizing radiation was dependent upon p53 status of a cell line, suggesting that the promoter retained properties of the p21 promoter. This technique is simple and efficient to improve a promoter responsive to other stimulus of interest besides IR. © 2009 The Society for Biotechnology, Japan.",Excluded

After the first sign of corneal angiogenesis was noted, the corneal region was irradiated with a dose of 10 Gy or 20 Gy. The control rabbits received no irradiation. The eyes were examined by slitlamp biomicroscopy and photographed, over a period of 28 days. The maximum length and total surface area of corneal angiogenesis were quantified by computerized image analysis., RESULTS: Corneal angiogenesis was noted on day 3 following implantation of the hydrogel sheet. In the rabbits irradiated with 10 Gy, the maximum length and total surface area of corneal angiogenesis were both significantly lower on day 4 and 7 following irradiation, compared to the respective measurement in the controls. In the rabbits irradiated with 20 Gy, the maximum length and total surface area of corneal angiogenesis were significantly lower between days 4 and 21, and between days 4 and 14, respectively, compared to the respective measurement in the controls., CONCLUSIONS: Focal X-ray irradiation to the corneal region suppressed corneal angiogenesis in a dose-dependent manner.

Analyzing these cases predisposing factors and different therapeutic options of this condition are discussed. Treatment options of radiation induced enteritis are limited; however, targeted therapy significantly improves the outcome.

3357,"Induction docetaxel-cisplatin followed by extended-field radiotherapy in patients with cervical metastases from unknown primary carcinoma Background: Cervical metastases from unknown primary tumors are rare and no clear therapeutic options are available. This retrospective analysis aimed to evaluate toxicity and activity of a sequential chemoradiation regimen consisting of induction chemotherapy followed by extendedfield radiotherapy in patients with cervical metastases from unknown primary tumors. Patients and Methods: Patients with cytological or histological diagnosis of latero-cervical lymph-node metastasis from carcinoma with unknown origin treated with sequential chemotherapy (3 cycles of docetaxel and cisplatin, each administered as intravenous infusion at the dose of 75 mg/m2 on day 1, every 21 days) and radiotherapy (cumulative dose of 70 Gy) were included in this study. The radiological response was assessed by central review according to the revised RECIST criteria. Result(s): Fifteen patients received three cycles of induction chemotherapy with the combination of docetaxel and cisplatin. Patients were subsequently treated with extendedfield radiotherapy. Three complete responses were observed after induction chemotherapy and 13 after the chemoradiation treatment. The overall response rate after chemoradiation, was 93.3% (14 of 15 evaluable patients). One year disease-free-survival was 83.3% (10 of 12 evaluable patients). Treatment was well-tolerated; two cases of grade 4 neutropenia, two of grade 3 mucositis and eight of grade 2 nausea were the worst, most clinically-relevant sideeffects. Conclusion(s): Induction chemotherapy followed by extended-field radiotherapy showed good activity and manageable toxicity in patients with cervical metastases from unknown primary tumors.",Excluded
2727,"3D deep learning angiography (3D-DLA) from C-arm Conebeam CT BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Deep learning is a branch of artificial intelligence that has demonstrated unprecedented performance in many medical imaging applications. Our purpose was to develop a deep learning angiography method to generate 3D cerebral angiograms from a single contrast-enhanced C-arm conebeam CT acquisition in order to reduce image artifacts and radiation dose. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A set of 105 3D rotational angiography examinations were randomly selected from an internal data base. All were acquired using a clinical system in conjunction with a standard injection protocol. More than 150 million labeled voxels from 35 subjects were used for training. A deep convolutional neural network was trained to classify each image voxel into 3 tissue types (vasculature, bone, and soft tissue). The trained deep learning angiography model was then applied for tissue classification into a validation cohort of 8 subjects and a final testing cohort of the remaining 62 subjects. The final vasculature tissue class was used to generate the 3D deep learning angiography images. To quantify the generalization error of the trained model, we calculated the accuracy, sensitivity, precision, and Dice similarity coefficients for vasculature classification in relevant anatomy. The 3D deep learning angiography and clinical 3D rotational angiography images were subjected to a qualitative assessment for the presence of intersweep motion artifacts. RESULT(S): Vasculature classification accuracy and 95% CI in the testing dataset were 98.7% (98.3%-99.1%). No residual signal from osseous structures was observed for any 3D deep learning angiography testing cases except for small regions in the otic capsule and nasal cavity compared with 37% (23/62) of the 3D rotational angiographies. CONCLUSION(S): Deep learning angiography accurately recreated the vascular anatomy of the 3D rotational angiography reconstructions without a mask. Deep learning angiography reduced misregistration artifacts induced by intersweep motion, and it reduced radiation exposure required to obtain clinically useful 3D rotational angiography.Copyright © 2018 American Society of Neuroradiology.

781,"Cognitive and radiological effects of radiotherapy in patients with low-grade glioma: long-term follow-up BACKGROUND: Our previous study on cognitive functioning among 195 patients with low-grade glioma (LGG) a mean of 6 years after diagnosis suggested that the tumour itself, rather than the radiotherapy used to treat it, has the most deleterious effect on cognitive functioning; only high fraction dose radiotherapy (>2 Gy) resulted in significant added cognitive deterioration. The present study assesses the radiological and cognitive abnormalities in survivors of LGG at a mean of 12 years after first diagnosis., METHODS: Patients who have had stable disease since the first assessment were invited for follow-up cognitive assessment (letter-digit substitution test, concept shifting test, Stroop colour-word test, visual verbal learning test, memory comparison test, and categoric word fluency). Compound scores in six cognitive domains (attention, executive functioning, verbal memory, working memory, psychomotor functioning, and information processing speed) were calculated to detect differences between patients who had radiotherapy and patients who did not have radiotherapy. White-matter hyperintensities and global cortical atrophy were rated on MRI scans., FINDINGS: 65 patients completed neuropsychological follow-up at a mean of 12 years (range 6-28 years). 32 (49%) patients had received radiotherapy (three had fraction doses >2 Gy). The patients who had radiotherapy had more deficits that affected attentional functioning at the second follow-up, regardless of fraction dose, than those who did not have radiotherapy (-1.6 [SD 2.4] vs -0.1 [1.3], p=0.003; mean difference 1.4, 95% CI 0.5-2.4). The patients who had radiotherapy also did worse in measures of executive functioning (-2.0 [3.7] vs -0.5 [1.2], p=0.03; mean difference 1.5, 0.2-2.9) and information processing speed (-2.0 [3.7] vs -0.6 [1.5], p=0.05; mean difference 0.8, 0.009-1.6]) between the two assessments. Furthermore, attentional functioning deteriorated significantly between the first and second assessments in patients who had radiotherapy (p=0.25). In total, 17 (53%) patients who had radiotherapy developed cognitive disabilities deficits in at least five of 18 neuropsychological test parameters compared with four (27%) patients who were radiotherapy naive. White-matter hyperintensities and global cortical atrophy were associated with worse cognitive functioning in several domains., INTERPRETATION: Long-term survivors of LGG who did not have radiotherapy had stable radiological and cognitive status. By contrast, patients with low-grade glioma who received radiotherapy showed a progressive decline in attentional functioning, even those who received fraction doses that are regarded as safe (</=2 Gy). These cognitive deficits are associated with radiological abnormalities. Our results suggest that the risk of long-term cognitive and radiological compromise that is associated with radiotherapy should be considered when treatment is planned., FUNDING: Kaptein Fonds; Schering Plough.",Included
687,"The use of a fully integrated electronic medical record to minimize cumulative lifetime radiation exposure from CT scanning to detect urinary tract calculi In order to determine the effects of implementation of an electronic medical record on rates of repeat computed tomography (CT) scanning in the emergency department (ED) setting, we analyzed the utilization of CT of the kidneys, ureters, and bladder (CT KUB) for the detection of urinary tract calculi for periods before and after the implementation of a hospital-wide electronic medical record system. Rates of repeat CT scanning within a 6-month period of previous scan were determined pre- and post-implementation and compared. Prior to implementation, there was a 6-month repeat rate of 6.2 % compared with the post-implementation period, which was associated with a 6-month repeat rate of 4.1 %. Statistical analysis using a two-sample, one-tailed t test for difference of means was associated with a p value of 0.00007. This indicates that the implementation of the electronic medical record system was associated with a 34 % decrease in 6-month repeat CT KUB scans. We conclude that the use of an electronic medical record can be associated with a decrease in utilization of unnecessary repeat CT imaging, leading to decreased cumulative lifetime risk for cancer in these patients and more efficient utilization of ED and radiologic resources. © 2013 Am Soc Emergency Radiol.",Excluded
2511,"Radiation risks in lung cancer screening programs: a comparison with nuclear industry workers and atomic bomb survivors The National Lung Cancer Screening Trial (NLST) demonstrated that screening with low-dose CT (LDCT) scan reduced lung cancer and overall mortality by 20% and 7%, respectively. The LDCT scanning involves an approximate 2-mSv dose, whereas full-chest CT scanning, the major diagnostic study used to follow up nodules, may involve a dose of 8 mSv. Radiation associated with CT scanning and other diagnostic studies to follow up nodules may present an independent risk of lung cancer. On the basis of the NLST, we estimated the incidence and prevalence of nodules detected in screening programs. We followed the Fleischner guidelines for follow-up of nodules to assess cumulative radiation exposure over 20- and 30-year periods. We then evaluated nuclear worker cohort studies and atomic bomb survivor studies to assess the risk of lung cancer from radiation associated with long-term lung cancer screening programs. The findings indicate that a 55-year-old lung screening participant may experience a cumulative radiation exposure of up to 280 mSv over a 20-year period and 420 mSv over 30 years. These exposures exceed those of nuclear workers and atomic bomb survivors. This assessment suggests that long-term (20-30 years) LDCT screening programs are associated with nontrivial cumulative radiation doses. Current lung cancer screening protocols, if conducted over 20- to 30-year periods, can independently increase the risk of lung cancer beyond cigarette smoking as a result of cumulative radiation exposure. Radiation exposures from LDCT screening and follow-up diagnostic procedures exceed lifetime radiation exposures among nuclear power workers and atomic bomb survivors.",Excluded
2643,"Low-dose radiation exposure and protection against atherosclerosis in ApoE(-/-) mice: the influence of P53 heterozygosity We recently described the effects of low-dose gamma-radiation exposures on atherosclerosis in genetically susceptible (ApoE(-/-)) mice with normal p53 function. Doses as low as 25 mGy, given at either early or late stage disease, generally protected against atherosclerosis in a manner distinctly nonlinear with dose. We now report the influence of low doses (25-500 mGy) on atherosclerosis in ApoE(-/-) mice with reduced p53 function (Trp53(+/-)). Single exposures were given at either low or high dose rate (1 or 150 mGy/min) to female C57BL/6J ApoE(-/-) Trp53(+/-) mice. Mice were exposed at either early stage disease (2 months of age) and examined 3 or 6 months later, or at late stage disease (7 months of age) and examined 2 or 4 months later. In unirradiated mice, reduced p53 functionality elevated serum cholesterol and accelerated both aortic root lesion growth and severity in young mice. Radiation exposure to doses as low as 25 mGy at early stage disease, at either the high or the low dose rate, inhibited lesion growth, decreased lesion frequency and slowed the progression of lesion severity in the aortic root. In contrast, exposure at late stage disease produced generally detrimental effects. Both low-and high-dose-rate exposures accelerated lesion growth and high dose rate exposures also increased serum cholesterol levels. These results show that at early stage disease, reduced p53 function does not influence the protective effects against atherosclerosis of low doses given at low dose rate. In contrast, when exposed to the same doses at late stage disease, reduced p53 function produced detrimental effects, rather than the protective effects seen in Trp53 normal mice. As in the Trp53 normal mice, all effects were highly nonlinear with dose. These results indicate that variations in p53 functionality can dramatically alter the outcome of a low-dose exposure, and that the assumption of a linear response with dose for human populations is probably unwarranted.",Excluded
2137,"Different patterns of allelic imbalance in sporadic tumors and tumors associated with long-term exposure to gamma-radiation The study aimed to reveal cancer related mutations in DNA repair and cell cycle genes associated with chronic occupational exposure to gamma-radiation in personnel of the Siberian Group of Chemical Enterprises (SGCE). Mutations were analyzed by comparing genotypes of malignant tumors and matched normal tissues of 255 cancer patients including 98 exposed to external gamma-radiation (mean dose 128.1+/-150.5mSv). Also a genetic association analysis was carried out in a sample of 149 cancer patients and 908 healthy controls occupationally exposed to gamma-radiation (153.2+/-204.6mSv and 150.5+/-211.2mSv, respectively). Eight SNPs of genes of DNA excision repair were genotyped (rs13181, rs1052133, rs1042522, rs2305427, rs4244285, rs1045642, rs1805419 and rs1801133). The mutation profiles in heterozygous loci for selected SNP were different between sporadic tumors and tumors in patients exposed to radiation. In sporadic tumors, heterozygous genotype Arg/Pro of the rs1042522 SNP mutated into Arg/0 in 15 cases (9.6%) and 0/Pro in 14 cases (8.9%). The genotype Lys/Gln of the rs13181 SNP mutated into Lys/0 and 0/Gln in 9 and 4 cases, respectively. In tumors of patients exposed to low-level radiation, the rs1042522 Arg/0 mutated genotype was found in 12 cases (12.1%), while in 2 cases (2%) 0/Pro mutation was observed. Finally, the rs13181 0/Gln mutated genotype was observed in 15 cases (16,5%) . Thus, our study showed the difference in patterns of allelic imbalance in tumors appeared under low-level radiation exposure and spontaneous tumors for selected SNPs. This suggests different mechanisms of inactivation of heterozygous genotypes in sporadic and radiation-induced tumors. Copyright © 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",Included
3286,"16. The fraction of cancer attributable to lifestyle and environmental factors in the UK in 2010 This chapter summarises the results of the preceding sections, which estimate the fraction of cancers occurring in the UK in 2010 that can be attributed to sub-optimal, past exposures of 14 lifestyle and environmental risk factors. For each of 18 cancer types, we present the percentage of cases attributable to one or all of the risk factors considered (tobacco, alcohol, four elements of diet (consumption of meat, fruit and vegetables, fibre, and salt), overweight, lack of physical exercise, occupation, infections, radiation (ionising and solar), use of hormones, and reproductive history (breast feeding)).Exposure to less than optimum levels of the 14 factors was responsible for 42.7% of cancers in the UK in 2010 (45.3% in men, 40.1% in women)-a total of about 134 000 cases.Tobacco smoking is by far the most important risk factor for cancer in the UK, responsible for 60 000 cases (19.4% of all new cancer cases) in 2010. The relative importance of other exposures differs by sex. In men, deficient intake of fruits and vegetables (6.1%), occupational exposures (4.9%) and alcohol consumption (4.6%) are next in importance, while in women, it is overweight and obesity (because of the effect on breast cancer)-responsible for 6.9% of cancers, followed by infectious agents (3.7%).Population- attributable fractions provide a valuable quantitative appraisal of the impact of different factors in cancer causation, and are thus helpful in prioritising cancer control strategies. However, quantifying the likely impact of preventive interventions requires rather complex scenario modelling, including specification of realistically achievable population distributions of risk factors, and the timescale of change, as well as the latent periods between exposure and outcome, and the rate of change following modification in exposure level. © 2011 Cancer Research UK All rights reserved.",Included

324,"Feasibility and acute efficacy of radiofrequency ablation of cavotricuspid isthmus-dependent atrial flutter guided by real-time 3D TEE Objectives: The aim of this study was to evaluate the feasibility and acute efficacy of real-time 3-dimensional transesophageal echocardiography (RT3DTEE)guided ablation of the cavotricuspid isthmus (CVTI). Background(s): The use of RT3DTEE to guide a transcatheter radiofrequency ablation procedure has never been systematically investigated. Method(s): Seventy consecutive patients with CVTI-dependent atrial flutter underwent CVTI ablation. Procedural monitoring using RT3DTEE was assigned to patients who requested general anesthesia for the procedure (n = 21 [30%]). In the other 49 patients (the control group), the procedures were monitored using the standard fluoroscopic approach. Procedural time was considered as skin-to-skin electrophysiological procedure duration, not including anesthesia preparation; adequate radiofrequency ablation applications (with fixed temperature and power settings) were considered as lesions lasting < 60 s. Result(s): RT3DTEE allowed visualization of the CVTI and identified related structures in most patients (20 of 21); anatomic features such as long CVTI (n = 11), prominent Eustachian ridge (n = 9), prominent Eustachian valve (n = 6), septal recess (n = 8), and pectinate muscles (n = 10) were frequent. Also, RT3DTEE allowed continuous visualization of ablation catheter movement and contact. Compared with the control group, RT3DTEE was equally effective in achieving CVTI bidirectional block (100% in both groups), and no complications occurred. RT3DTEE shortened procedural time (median 73.0 min, interquartile range [IQR] 60.0 to 90.0 min, vs. median 115.0 min, IQR 85.0 to 133.0 min, p < 0.001), reduced radiation exposure (median fluoroscopy time 4.2 min, IQR 3.1 to 8.4 min, vs. median 19.3 min, IQR 12.9 to 36.4 min, p < 0.001; median fluoroscopy dose 575.4 cGy . cm2, IQR 428.5 to 1,299.4 cGy . cm2, vs. median 3,520.7 cGy . cm2, IQR 1,700.0 to 6,709.0 cGy . cm2, p < 0.001), and reduced the number of radiofrequency applications to achieve bidirectional block (median 7, IQR 6 to 10, vs. median 12, IQR 10 to 22, p = 0.007). A strong learning curve was detected by comparing procedural data between the first and last patients treated using RT3DTEE. Conclusion(s): RT3DTEE-guided ablation of CVTI was feasible, allowing real-time detailed morphological CVTI characterization as well as continuous visualization of the ablation catheter during radiofrequency ablation. This approach entailed marked reductions in procedural time, radiation exposure, and the number of radiofrequency applications. © 2011 American College of Cardiology Foundation.",Excluded
522,"Correlation between fracture healing status and euroqol score (EQ-5D) during conservative therapy for osteoporotic vertebral compression fractures INTRODUCTION: EQ-5D is a standardized instrument utilized as a measure of health related quality of life outcome. There are few reports investigating the relationship between fracture healing status and EQ-5D after conservative treatment for painful vertebral compression fractures (VCFs). METHOD(S): Forty consecutive patients (5 male, 35 female, average age: 78) had fresh VCFs due to primary osteoporosis diagnosed by MRI. They were treated in hospital for 2 to 3 weeks by conservative therapy consisting of medication (NSAIDs, Alendronate, Calcitonin) and brace. EQ-5D and questionnaires were collected at pre-fracture (retrospective) and post-fracture at first visit, at discharge and after 12-week conservative therapy. Radiographic evaluation was conducted by flexion-extension X-ray and CT. Pseudoarthrosis was diagnosed when the intervertebral cleft was seen in both X-ray and CT, and there was a motion more than 3-degrees in flexion-extension X-rays. Correlations among fracture healing status, brace compliance, and EuroQOL score were investigated. Final follow-up rate was 85% (34/40). RESULT(S): There were 30 patients who could move by themselves (Group A), and other 10 patients who could not even turn over due to severe pain (Group B). EQ-5D at pre-fracture, post-fracture, discharge, and after conservative therapy were 0.9067, 0.5030, 0.7538, and 0.7688 in Group A, 0.7359, -0.0179, 0.5546, and 0.7948 in Group B, respectively. Post-fracture EQ-5D in Group B was significantly lower (p<0.0001). Pseudoarthrosis was found in 6 cases (18%), while the intervertebral cleft was observed in 41 at 12-weeks. All these 6 cases answered as the brace compliance, almost all day"". Average EQ-5D in these 6 cases was 0.2657 at first visit and 0.689 after 12-week therapy, which was significantly lower than that of other fracture healed cases(0.8029, p=0.0001). DISCUSSION: Successful fracture healing rate in this conservative therapy was 82%. Eighteen percent of pseudoarthrosis patients with lower EQ-5D could be candidates for the interventional therapy.""",Excluded
2594,"The Aftermath of Surviving Acute Radiation Hematopoietic Syndrome and its Mitigation Intensive research is underway to find new agents that can successfully mitigate the acute effects of radiation exposure. This is primarily in response to potential counterthreats of radiological terrorism and nuclear accidents but there is some hope that they might also be of value for cancer patients treated with radiation therapy. Research into mitigation countermeasures typically employs classic animal models of acute radiation syndromes (ARS) that develop after whole-body irradiation (WBI). While agents are available that successfully mitigate ARS when given after radiation exposure, their success raises questions as to whether they simply delay lethality or unmask potentially lethal radiation pathologies that may appear later in time. Life shortening is a well-known consequence of WBI in humans and experimental animals, but it is not often examined in a mitigation setting and its causes, other than cancer, are not well-defined. This is in large part because delayed effects of acute radiation exposure (DEARE) do not follow the strict time-dose phenomena associated with ARS and present as a diverse range of symptoms and pathologies with low mortality rates that can be evaluated only with the use of large cohorts of subjects, as in this study. Here, we describe chronically increased mortality rates up to 660 days in large numbers of mice given LD70/30 doses of WBI. Systemic myeloid cell activation after WBI persists in some mice and is associated with late immunophenotypic changes and hematopoietic imbalance. Histopathological changes are largely of a chronic inflammatory nature and variable incidence, as are the clinical symptoms, including late diarrhea that correlates temporally with changes in the content of the microbiome. We also describe the acute and long-term consequences of mitigating hematopoietic ARS (H-ARS) lethality after LD70/30 doses of WBI in multiple cohorts of mice treated uniformly with radiation mitigators that have a common 4-nitro-phenylsulfonamide (NPS) pharmacophore. Effective NPS mitigators dramatically decrease ARS mortality. There is slightly increased subacute mortality, but the rate of late mortalities is slowed, allowing some mice to live a normal life span, which is not the case for WBI controls. The study has broad relevance to radiation late effects and their potential mitigation and epitomizes the complex interaction between radiation-damaged tissues and immune homeostasis.Copyright © 2019 by Radiation Research Society.

2466,"Phase I/II study of stereotactic body radiotherapy for spinal metastasis and its pattern of failure Object. The authors report data concerning the safety, effectiveness, and patterns of failure obtained in a Phase I/II study of stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) for spinal metastatic tumors. Methods. Sixty-three cancer patients underwent near-simultaneous computed tomography-guided SBRT. Spinal magnetic resonance imaging was conducted at baseline and at each follow-up visit. The National Cancer Institute Common Toxicity Criteria 2.0 assessments were used to evaluate toxicity. Results. The median tumor volume of 74 spinal metastatic lesions was 37.4 cm3 (range 1.6-358 cm3). No neuropathy or myelopathy was observed during a median follow-up period of 21.3 months (range 0.9-49.6 months). The actuarial 1-year tumor progression-free incidence was 84% for all tumors. Pattern-of-failure analysis showed two primary mechanisms of failure: 1) recurrence in the bone adjacent to the site of previous treatment, and 2) recurrence in the epidural space adjacent to the spinal cord. Grade 3 or 4 toxicities were limited to acute Grade 3 nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea (one case); Grade 3 dysphagia and trismus (one case); and Grade 3 noncardiac chest pain (one case). There was no subacute or late Grade 3 or 4 toxicity. Conclusions. Analysis of the data obtained in the present study supports the safety and effectiveness of SBRT in cases of spinal metastatic cancer. The authors consider it prudent to routinely treat the pedicles and posterior elements using a wide bone margin posterior to the diseased vertebrae because of the possible direct extension into these structures. For patients without a history of radiotherapy, more liberal spinal cord dose constraints than those used in this study could be applied to help reduce failures in the epidural space.",Excluded
231,"Randomized trial addressing risk features and time factors of surgery plus radiotherapy in advanced head-and-neck cancer Purpose: A multi-institutional, prospective, randomized trial was undertaken in patients with advanced head-and-neck squamous cell carcinoma to address (1) the validity of using pathologic risk features, established from a previous study, to determine the need for, and dose of, postoperative radiotherapy (PORT); (2) the impact of accelerating PORT using a concomitant boost schedule; and (3) the importance of the overall combined treatment duration on the treatment outcome. Methods and Materials: Of 288 consecutive patients with advanced disease registered preoperatively, 213 fulfilled the trial criteria and went on to receive therapy predicated on a set of pathologic risk features: no PORT for the low-risk group (n=31); 57.6 Gy during 6.5 weeks for the intermediate-risk group (n=31); and, by random assignment, 63 Gy during 5 weeks (n=76) or 7 weeks (n=75) for the high-risk group. Patients were irradiated with standard techniques appropriate to the site of disease and likely areas of spread. The study end points were locoregional control (LRC), survival, and morbidity. Result(s): Patients with low or intermediate risks had significantly higher LRC and survival rates than those with high-risk features (p=0.003 and p=0.0001, respectively), despite receiving no PORT or lower dose PORT, respectively. For high-risk patients, a trend toward higher LRC and survival rates was noted when PORT was delivered in 5 rather than 7 weeks. A prolonged interval between surgery and PORT in the 7-week schedule was associated with significantly lower LRC (p=0.03) and survival (p=0.01) rates. Consequently, the cumulative duration of combined therapy had a significant impact on the LRC (p=0.005) and survival (p=0.03) rates. A 2-week reduction in the PORT duration by using the concomitant boost technique did not increase the late treatment toxicity. Conclusion(s): This Phase III trial established the power of risk assessment using pathologic features in determining the need for, and dose of, PORT in patients with advanced head-and-neck squamous cell cancer in a prospective, multi-institutional setting. It also revealed the impact of the overall treatment time in the combination of surgery and PORT on the outcome in high-risk patients and showed that PORT acceleration without a reduction in dose by a concomitant boost regimen did not increase the late complication rate. These findings emphasize the importance of coordinated interdisciplinary care in the delivery of combined surgery and RT. © 2001 Elsevier Science Inc.",Included
3576,"Reporting on acromion morphology: Classifications demonstrate significant correlation Objectives Various classifications of acromion morphology exist in the literature. Only a few studies have compared these classifications and their results vary substantially. The primary purpose of this study was to determine a correlation between different classifications of acromial morphology on a large cohort. The secondary purpose was to establish if there is a difference between age, sides and gender. Methods A retrospective analysis of 1853 subjects' shoulder CTs has been performed. A total of 350 CT scans of polytraumatised patients have been selected out of the initial cohort, after exclusion of fractures and technically insufficient scans. Acromial slope, type, lateral acromion angle (LAA) and acromion index were measured and gender, age and side differences were analysed. Correlations between the different classifications were analysed using the Pearson correlation coefficient. Results The average patient age of this cohort was 48 (range 16-90). There were 232 men and 118 women. There was a significant correlation between all classifications. Excellent correlations have been shown for left-right comparison of all measurements. Gender showed no correlation to any of the measurements. Age was correlated to LAA and acromial type. Conclusion There is a significant correlation between all investigated acromion classifications, demonstrated with the CT. This may aid the clinician in choosing a classification to use when reporting on a patient, depending on the pathology even when plain X-rays are obtained. Age is correlated to LAA and acromial type. There is a strong bilateral correlation within each patient. Gender is not correlated to the acromial shape in any classification.

In this study, radiation-induced kidney injury represented by changes of creatinine clearance (Ccr) and renal parenchymal volume measured by computed tomography (CT) were evaluated by analysing dose-volume histograms (DVHs) in patients with primary gastric diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (PGDLBCL) treated with chemoradiotherapy., MATERIALS AND METHODS: Thirty-eight PGDLBCL patients (seventy-six kidneys) treated with chemoradiotherapy were included in this study. At least 4 years of follow-up was required for eligibility. Patients underwent (immuno-) chemotherapy followed by radiotherapy with approximately 40Gy to the whole stomach and perigastric lymph nodes. Ccr and CT were obtained at least annually. Changes of Ccr and renal parenchymal volume before and 4years after radiotherapy were compared using DVH parameters., RESULTS: Mean Ccr decreased significantly from 82.7mL/min (range, 39-124mL/min) before radiotherapy to 70.4mL/min (range, 35-109mL/min) (p=0.01) 4years after radiotherapy. Mean reduction of bilateral renal parenchymal volume was 12% (range, -5-37%) in the same time period. Ccr and renal parenchymal volume tended to lower over time more than 4years after radiotherapy. Concerning DVH analysis, V20Gy26.6% and D30%19Gy had a significant risk of bilateral renal atrophy of 14% and reduction of the Ccr20mL/min., CONCLUSION: This study revealed that there was a definite relationship between DVH, renal atrophy and Ccr reduction.

Mean cumulative doses were 45 millisievert for whole-body external ionizing radiation exposure and 172 milligray for lung dose from radon decay products. Only SMR for dementia and AD among males was statistically significant (SMR=1.29; 95% confidence interval: 1.04, 1.54)., CONCLUSIONS: This is the largest study to date to examine long-term health risks of uranium processing workers.",Included
567,"Clinical trial of chemotherapy by superselective intra-arterial infusion of nedaplatin (CDGP) and 5-FU with concurrent radiotherapy for advanced oral cancer Nedaplatin (CDGP) is one of the platinum-derivatives to further improve the anti-tumor effect and to reduce adverse effects of cisplatin, such as renal toxicity. The present study evaluated the efficacy and adverse events of chemotherapy by superselective intra-arterial infusion of CDGP and 5-FU combined with concurrent radiotherapy in patients with advanced squamous cell carcinoma of the oral cavity. Sixteen patients were treated with CDGP plus 5-FU in combination with concurrent irradiation of 40.60 Gy. Ten patients were treated as a preoperative therapy and 6 as a definitive therapy. The overall clinical response rate was 93.8% and histological effects according to the grading system of Shimosato et al. were seen in 13/16 (81.2%). Adverse events were observed in all patients. Mucositis, leucopenia and thrombocytopenia (>Grade 2) were seen in 13 (81.3%), 11 (68.8%) and 8 (50.0%) of 16 patients, respectively. The overall 2-year and 4 months survival rate was 86.2%. One patient have died of disease and another of other causes.

Materials/Methods: 13 patients with HNSCC underwent CT-simulations with neutral tongue position and stick-out tongue for planning IMRTs (IMRT-N and IMRT-S, respectively). Planning objectives were to deliver 70 Gy, 63 Gy, and 56 Gy in 35 fractions to 95% of PTVs using simultaneously integrated boost technique, with mean radiation doses (Dmean) of < 26 Gy to the parotid gland, < 30 Gy to the submandibular gland, and < 36 Gy to OC. For other organs at risk (OARs), Radiation Therapy Oncology Group (RTOG) recommended dose constraints were applied. Planning was optimized to minimize doses to OARs without compromising coverage of PTVs. Radiation doses to OC in IMRT-N and IMRT-S was compared. Data are presented as mean >= standard deviation. Result(s): OC volumes were similar in IMRT-N and IMRT-S (129 >= 34.0 cm3 and 130.8 >= 38.8 cm3, respectively, P = 0.25). Tongue volume in outside of mouth was 7.1 >= 3.8 cm3 (5.4 >= 2.6% of entire OC and 7.8 >= 3.1% of oral tongue) in IMRT-S. Anterior tip of lips to gingiva was 0.9 >= 0.4 cm in IMRT-S and 0.1 >= 0.2 cm in IMRT-N (P<0.001). Distance from base of tongue (BOT) to pharyngeal constrictor (PC) was 1.5 >= 0.5 cm in IMRT-N and 2.0 >= 0.6 cm in IMRT-S (p<0.001). IMRT-N and IMRT-S showed equivalent radiation targets coverages with sparing OARs, except OC. Dmean of OC was 34.9 >= 8.0 Gy and 31.4 >= 8.7 Gy with IMRT-N and IMRT-S, respectively (P<0.001). OC volume receiving >= 36 Gy (V36) was 40.6 >= 16.9% using IMRT-N compared to 33.0 >= 17.0% with IMRT-S (P<0.001). Dmean of oral tongue was 38.1 >= 7.9 Gy and 32.8 >= 8.8 Gy in IMRT-N and IMRT-S, respectively (P<0.001). Dmean of lips was 16.0 >= 3.7 Gy in IMRT-N and 13.5 >= 4.0 Gy in IMRT-S (p<0.001). Conclusion(s): IMRT-S for patients with HNSCC has significant decreased radiation dose to OC and increased distance from BOT to PC and from dorsal surface of tongue to palate than IMRT-N. The use of IMRT-S rather than IMRT-N can significantly decrease radiation dose to OARs in OC or pharynx, which may potentially reduce RT related toxicity in OC or pharynx in patients RT for HNSCC.",Excluded
1713,"Treatment of nonresectable hepatocellular carcinoma with intrahepatic 90Y-microspheres Treatment for nonresectable hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is palliative. The relatively greater arteriolar density of hepatic tumors compared with normal liver suggests that intrahepatic arterial administration of 90Y-microspheres can be selectively deposited in tumor nodules and results in significantly greater radiation exposure to the tumor than external irradiation. The purpose of this study was to determine the proportion (frequency) and duration of response, survival, and toxicity after intrahepatic arterial injection of 90Y-microspheres in patients with HCC. Method(s): Patients with documented HCC, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status 0-3, adequate bone marrow, and hepatic and pulmonary function were eligible for study. Patients who had significant shunting of blood to the lungs or gastrointestinal (GI) tract or who could not undergo cannulation of the hepatic artery were excluded. Patients received a planned dose of 100 Gy through a catheter placed into the hepatic artery. Result(s): Twenty-two patients were treated with 90Y-microspheres; 20 of the treated patients (median age, 62.5 y) were evaluated for treatment efficacy. Nine patients were Okuda stage I, and 11 were Okuda stage II. The median dose delivered was 104 Gy (range, 46-145 Gy). All 22 treated patients experienced at least 1 adverse event. Of the 31 (15%) serious adverse events, the most common were elevations in liver enzymes and bilirubin and upper GI ulceration. The response rate was 20%. The median duration of response was 127 wk; the median survival was 54 wk. Multivariable analysis suggested that a dose >104 Gy (P = 0.06), tumor-to-liver activity uptake ratio >2 (P = 0.06), and Okuda stage I (P = 0.07) were associated with longer survival. Conclusion(s): Significantly higher doses of radiation can be delivered to a HCC tumor by intrahepatic arterial administration of 90Y-microspheres than by external beam radiation. This treatment appears to be beneficial in nonresectable HCC with acceptable toxicity.",Excluded
2040,"A Prospective Study of Proton Beam Reirradiation for Esophageal Cancer PURPOSE: Reirradiation to the esophagus carries a significant risk of complications. Proton therapy may offer an advantage in the reirradiation setting due to the lack of exit dose and potential sparing of previously radiated normal tissues., METHODS AND MATERIALS: Between June 2010 and February 2014, 14 patients with a history of thoracic radiation and newly diagnosed or locally recurrent esophageal cancer began proton beam reirradiation on a prospective trial. Primary endpoints were feasibility and acute toxicity. Toxicity was graded according Common Toxicity Criteria version 4.0., RESULTS: The median follow-up was 10 months (2-25 months) from the start of reirradiation. Eleven patients received concurrent chemotherapy. The median interval between radiation courses was 32 months (10-307 months). The median reirradiation prescription dose was 54.0 Gy (relative biological effectiveness [RBE]) (50.4-61.2 Gy[RBE]), and the median cumulative prescription dose was 109.8 Gy (76-129.4 Gy). Of the 10 patients who presented with symptomatic disease, 4 patients had complete resolution of symptoms, and 4 had diminished or stable symptoms. Two patients had progressive symptoms. The median time to symptom recurrence was 10 months. Maximum acute nonhematologic toxicity attributable to radiation was grade 2 (64%, N=9), 3 (29%, N=4), 4 (0%), and 5 (7%, N=1). The acute grade 5 toxicity was an esophagopleural fistula more likely related to tumor progression than radiation. Grade 3 nonhematologic acute toxicities included dysphagia, dehydration, and pneumonia. There was 1 late grade 5 esophageal ulcer more likely related to tumor progression than radiation. There were 4 late grade 3 toxicities: heart failure, esophageal stenosis requiring dilation, esophageal ulceration from tumor, and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy tube dependence. The median time to local failure was 10 months, and the median overall survival was 14 months., CONCLUSIONS: Our data demonstrate that proton reirradiation is feasible, with an encouraging symptom control rate, modest radiation-related toxicity, and favorable survival in this high-risk population.

1773,"Occurrence of Phosphenes in Patients Undergoing Proton Beam Therapy for Ocular Tumor Purpose: Phosphenes are frequently reported by patients irradiated in the head and neck area. The aim of the present study was to characterize and investigate potential mechanisms of proton beam therapy (PBT)-induced phosphenes in a large population of patients undergoing PBT for ocular tumors. Design(s): Prospective cohort study. Method(s): Consecutive patients who underwent PBT in a single center were included. Immediately after the first session, all patients completed a questionnaire collecting information about the presence of phosphenes as well as their color, shape, and duration. Patient, tumor and treatment characteristics (dose volume histograms) were also collected. Result(s): Among the 474 patients included, 62.8% reported phosphenes during the first session of PBT. Reported colors were mainly blue-violet (70.5%) and white (14.1%). The prevalence of phosphenes was higher in younger patients (P =.003); other patient or ocular characteristics were not associated with the occurrence of phosphenes. Irradiation of the macula (P <.001) and/or optic disc (P <.001) were significantly associated with the presence of phosphenes, whereas blue-violet color was only associated with young age and irradiation of macular area (P =.04). Pupillary constriction was reported for 57.1% of patients with phosphenes vs 18.5% of patients without (P <.001). Blue-violet phosphenes (P <.001) and irradiation of macula (P =.001) were statistically associated with pupillary constriction. Conclusion(s): The present study reported a high rate of phosphenes in patients irradiated by PBT for ocular tumor. Their blue-violet color and their association with a pupillary constriction probably indicates the stimulation of S-cones and retinal ganglion cells that reflects the activation of the afferent visual pathway.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.",Excluded
3702,"Gracilis myocutaneous flap: Evaluation of potential risk factors and long-term donor-site morbidity This study reviewed our experience with the gracilis myocutaneous (GMC) flap, potential risk factors for flap necrosis, and long-term morbidity at the donor-site. From 1993 to 2002, 29 GMC flaps were harvested from 27 patients (pedicled n = 21 and free n = 8). The overall incidence of flap necrosis was 13.79% (partial (n = 2) and total (n = 2) necrosis). Flap necrosis was correlated with body mass index >25 (P = 0.022), with smoking (P = 0.04 9) and with radiation therapy at the recipient site (P = 0.020). The long-term morbidity at the donor-site was low, except for scar appearance (17.24%), thigh contour deformity (58.62%), and hypoesthesia (17.24%). Significant age and gender differences were seen for ranking of scar ugliness, with females (P = 0.0061) and younger patients (age <=55) (P = 0.046) assigned higher values. Significant age differences were seen for ranking of thigh contour deformity, with younger patients assigned higher values (P = 0.0012). In conclusion, patient overweight, smoking, and previous radiation therapy at the recipient site may be the ""potential risk factors"" for flap necrosis. The long-term morbidity at the donor-site was low, which was in agreement with previous reported studies. A larger series would be the subject of a future study.

828,"Gamma-H2AX-based dose estimation for whole and partial body radiation exposure Most human exposures to ionising radiation are partial body exposures. However, to date only limited tools are available for rapid and accurate estimation of the dose distribution and the extent of the body spared from the exposure. These parameters are of great importance for emergency triage and clinical management of exposed individuals. Here, measurements of gamma-H2AX immunofluorescence by microscopy and flow cytometry were compared as rapid biodosimetric tools for whole and partial body exposures. Ex vivo uniformly X-irradiated blood lymphocytes from one donor were used to generate a universal biexponential calibration function for gamma-H2AX foci/intensity yields per unit dose for time points up to 96 hours post exposure. Foci--but not intensity--levels remained significantly above background for 96 hours for doses of 0.5 Gy or more. Foci-based dose estimates for ex vivo X-irradiated blood samples from 13 volunteers were in excellent agreement with the actual dose delivered to the targeted samples. Flow cytometric dose estimates for X-irradiated blood samples from 8 volunteers were in excellent agreement with the actual dose delivered at 1 hour post exposure but less so at 24 hours post exposure. In partial body exposures, simulated by mixing ex vivo irradiated and unirradiated lymphocytes, foci/intensity distributions were significantly over-dispersed compared to uniformly irradiated lymphocytes. For both methods and in all cases the estimated fraction of irradiated lymphocytes and dose to that fraction, calculated using the zero contaminated Poisson test and gamma-H2AX calibration function, were in good agreement with the actual mixing ratios and doses delivered to the samples. In conclusion, gamma-H2AX analysis of irradiated lymphocytes enables rapid and accurate assessment of whole body doses while dispersion analysis of foci or intensity distributions helps determine partial body doses and the irradiated fraction size in cases of partial body exposures.",Excluded
2523,"Measuring Corneal Haze by Using Scheimpflug Photography and Confocal Microscopy PURPOSE: We compared corneal backscatter estimated from a Scheimpflug camera with backscatter estimated from a clinical confocal microscope across a wide range of corneal haze., METHODS: A total of 59 corneas from 35 patients with a range of severity of Fuchs' endothelial corneal dystrophy and 15 corneas from 9 normal participants were examined using a Scheimpflug camera (Pentacam) and a confocal microscope (ConfoScan 4). The mean image brightness from the anterior 120 mum, midcornea, and posterior 60 mum of the cornea across the central 2 mm recorded by the Scheimpflug camera and analogous regions from the confocal microscope were measured and standardized. Differences between instruments and correlations between backscatter and disease severity were determined by using generalized estimating equation models., RESULTS: Backscatter measured by the two instruments in the anterior and midcornea were correlated (r = 0.67 and 0.43, respectively, P < 0.001), although in the posterior cornea they were not correlated (r = 0.13, P = 0.66). Measured with the Scheimpflug camera, mean backscatter from the anterior and midcornea were greater, whereas backscatter from the posterior cornea was lower (P < 0.001) than that measured by the confocal microscope. Backscatter from the anterior cornea was correlated with disease severity for both instruments (Scheimpflug, r = 0.55, P < 0.001; confocal, r = 0.49, P = 0.003)., CONCLUSIONS: The Scheimpflug camera and confocal microscope should not be used interchangeably to measure corneal haze. The ability to detect changes in backscatter with disease severity is superior with the Scheimpflug camera. However, the confocal microscope provides higher resolution of corneal structure.",Excluded

1764,"Evaluation and definitive management of medically inoperable early stage non-small-cell lung cancer. Part 2: newer treatment modalities Lung cancer is estimated to be the second most commonly diagnosed cancer in both men and women in 2006, and the leading causes of cancer mortality. Non-small-cell lung cancer represents the majority of such cases. Most of these patients have locally advanced disease at presentation and are not eligible for curative resection. For the minority of patients who are technically resectable at presentation, lobectomy or pneumonectomy and pathologic mediastinal nodal staging offer the best overall survival. The high rate of comorbid medical illness and poor baseline pulmonary function in this population, however, make many such early-stage patients medically inoperable. For these patients, conventional single-modality radiotherapy has been the primary definitive treatment option, as discussed in part 1 of this article, which appeared in last month's issue. Numerous retrospective reports demonstrate long-term disease-free and overall survival data that are modestly superior to that expected after observation, but both local and distant failure continue to be significant risks. Investigation of radiotherapy dose escalation is ongoing, in an effort to improve local control while maintaining minimal toxicity. Additionally, emerging evidence suggests that new modalities, such as stereotactic radiosurgery and radiofrequency ablation, may also be potentially curative treatment alternatives. These modalities are addressed in part 2.",Excluded

The study aimed to ascertain the success of Astra-Tech implants in this patient group. Material(s) and Method(s): Patients who were restored with Astra Tech implants after ablative head and neck surgery were evaluated by analyzing serial prospectively accrued data since April 2006. Patient's data who received implants in the mandible were selected to be evaluated regarding implant success and contributing factors. Implant survival was calcula ted by the Kaplan-Meier analysis (Stat-View Version 4.1, Abacus Concepts, Inc.) and Cox models were used to evaluate any association between implant failure and reconstructive or medical treatment modality. Result(s): A total of 136 implants were placed in 33 patients during December 2006 to April 2012. Ten of the subjects were females and 23 were males with a mean age of 65 years. 21 patients received radiotherapy with a cumulative radiation dose between 56 Gray and 76 Gray. In six patients failures were noted resulting in a loss of 17 implants. Cumulative survival rates were 92.7% after 1 year and 87.5% after years two and three. Radiation therapy contributed to 12 of the 17 implant failures (p-value < 0.3). Failures occurred more in the interforam inal than in the posterior region (11-6). Free vascularized bone grafts with two failure fared significantly better than own bone or free bone grafts (p-value < 0.344). Conclusion(s): Astra Tech implant survival is acceptably high in this at risk group of patients and compares more than favorably with comparative studies in the literature. Radiation therapy seems to be associated with implant failure and the contribution of vascular-ized tissue to the survival of implants seems to be significant.",Excluded

During the same period three harbor porpoises were housed in a marine mammal facility on the opposite side of the harbor. All animals showed strong avoidance reactions after the start of the piling activities. As a measure to reduce the sound exposure for the animals an air bubble curtain was constructed and operated in a direct path between the piling site and the opening of the animals' semi-natural pool. The sound attenuation effect achieved with this system was determined by quantitative comparison of pile driving impulses simultaneously measured in front of and behind the active air bubble curtain. Mean levels of sound attenuation over a sequence of 95 consecutive pile strikes were 14 dB (standard deviation (s.d.) 3.4 dB) for peak to peak values and 13 dB (s.d. 2.5 dB) for SEL values. As soon as the air bubble curtain was installed and operated, no further avoidance reactions of the animals to the piling activities were apparent.",Excluded
966,"IMRT in hypopharyngeal tumors BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) data on hypopharyngeal cancer (HC) are scant. In this study, the authors report on early results in an own HC patient cohort treated with IMRT. A more favorable outcome as compared to historical data on conventional radiation techniques was expected., PATIENTS AND METHODS: 29 consecutive HC patients were treated with simultaneous integrated boost (SIB) IMRT between 01/2002 and 07/2005 (mean follow-up 16 months, range 4-44 months). Doses of 60-71 Gy with 2.0-2.2 Gy/fraction were applied. 26/29 patients were definitively irradiated, 86% received simultaneous cisplatin-based chemotherapy. 60% presented with locally advanced disease (T3/4 Nx, Tx N2c/3). Mean primary tumor volume measured 36.2 cm(3) (4-170 cm(3)), mean nodal volume 16.6 cm(3) (0-97 cm(3))., RESULTS: 2-year actuarial local, nodal, distant control, and overall disease-free survival were 90%, 93%, 93%, and 90%, respectively. In 2/4 patients with persistent disease (nodal in one, primary in three), salvage surgery was performed. The mean dose to the spinal cord (extension of > 5-15 mm) was 26 Gy (12-38 Gy); the mean maximum (point) dose was 44.4 Gy (26-58.9 Gy). One grade (G) 3 dysphagia and two G4 reactions (laryngeal fibrosis, dysphagia), both following the schedule with 2.2 Gy per fraction, have been observed so far. Larynx preservation was achieved in 25/26 of the definitively irradiated patients (one underwent a salvage laryngectomy); 23 had no or minimal dysphagia (G0-1)., CONCLUSION: Excellent early disease control and high patient satisfaction with swallowing function in HC following SIB IMRT were observed; these results need to be confirmed based on a longer follow-up period. In order to avoid G4 reactions, SIB doses of < 2.2 Gy/fraction are recommended for large tumors involving laryngeal structures.",Excluded
1908,"A specific melon concentrate exhibits photoprotective effects from antioxidant activity in healthy adults Skin is the largest body organ and the first barrier to exogenous threats. This organ is constantly exposed to external factors such as ultraviolet radiation, which induces many adverse effects including sunburn, depigmentation, photo aging, photo immune suppression, and even skin cancer. Antioxidants seem to be good candidates in order to reduce ultraviolet-mediated damages and to prevent the health consequences of ultraviolet exposure. The present investigation aims to further characterize the potential skin photoprotective effects of a food supplementation and a topical administration of a melon concentrate alone or in combination. A clinical study assessing the Minimal Erythema Dose (MED) was first set up to evaluate photoprotection. Afterward, an independent in vitro study was performed on human skin explants from a donor to evaluate the effect of the melon concentrate at different levels including on the sunburn cells formation and on the endogenous antioxidant enzymes and its influence on melanin. Clinical study results demonstrate that melon concentrate application and/or supplementation increased MED. It also increased the endogenous antioxidant enzymes and reduced sunburn cells and melanin level on irradiated skin explants. Therefore, it is suggested that melon concentrate administration (oral and/or topical) could be a useful strategy for photoprotection due to its antioxidant properties.Copyright © 2018 by the authors.

3570,"Capability of abdominal 320-detector row CT for small vasculature assessment compared with that of 64-detector row CT Objective: To compare the capability of 320-detector row CT (area-detector CT: ADCT) with step-and-shoot scan protocol for small abdominal vasculature assessment with that of 64-detector row CT with helical scan protocol. Material(s) and Method(s): Total of 60 patients underwent contrast-enhanced abdominal CT for preoperative assessment. Of all, 30 suspected to have lung cancer underwent ADCT using step-and-shoot scan protocol. The other 30 suspected to have renal cell carcinoma underwent 64-MDCT using helical scan protocol. Two experienced radiologists independently assessed inferior epigastric, hepatic subsegmental (in the segment 8), mesenteric marginal (Griffith point) and inferior phrenic arteries by using 5-point visual scoring systems. Kappa analysis was used for evaluation of interobserver agreement. To compare the visualization capability of the two systems, the Mann-Whitney U-test was used to compare the scores for each of the arteries. Result(s): Overall interobserver agreements for both systems were almost perfect (kappa > 0.80). Visualization scores for inferior epigastric and mesenteric arteries were significantly higher for ADCT than for 64-detector row CT (p < 0.05). No significant difference was found for hepatic subsegmental and inferior phrenic arteries.

163,"Evaluation of radiation-induced changes to parotid glands following conventional radiotherapy in patients with nasopharygneal carcinoma Objectives: Xerostomia is a common post-radiotherapy (post-RT) complication in nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) patients. This study evaluated the relation of post-RT parotid gland changes with the dose received. Method(s): Data from 18 NPC patients treated by radiotherapy between 1997 and 2001 were collected. Parotid gland volumes were measured and compared between their pre-RT and post-RT CT images; both sets of CT were conducted with the same scanning protocol. Doppler ultrasound was used to assess the haemodynamic condition of the glands after radiotherapy. Doppler ultrasound results were compared against 18 agematched normal participants. A questionnaire was used to evaluate the patients'comments of xerostomia condition. Radiotherapy treatment plans of the participants were retrieved from the Eclipse treatment planning system from which the radiation doses delivered to the parotid glands were estimated. The correlations of parotid gland doses and the post-RT changes were evaluated. Result(s): The post-RT parotid glands were significantly smaller (p<0.001) than the pre-RT ones. They also demonstrated lower vascular velocity, resistive and pulsatility indices (p<0.05) than normal participants. The degree of volume shrinkage and subjective severity of xerostomia demonstrated dose dependence, but such dependence was not definite in the haemodynamic changes. Conclusion(s): It was possible to predict the gland volume change and subjective severity of xerostomia based on the dose to the parotid glands for NPC patients. However, such prediction was not effective for the vascular changes. The damage to the gland was long lasting and had significant effects on the patients' quality of life. © 2011 The British Institute of Radiology.",Included
351,"Radiation dose response estimation with emphasis on low dose range using restricted cubic splines: application to all solid cancer mortality data, 1950-2003, in atomic bomb survivors Using the all solid cancer mortality data set of the Life Span Study (LSS) cohort from 1950 to 2003 (LSS Report 14) data among atomic bomb survivors, excess relative risk (ERR) statistical analyses were performed using the second degree polynomial and the threshold and restricted cubic spline (RCS) dose response models. For the RCS models with 3 to 7 knots of equally spaced percentiles with margins in the dose range greater than 50 mGy, the dose response was assumed to be linear at less than 70 to 90 mGy. Due to the skewed dose distribution of atomic bomb survivors, the current knot system for the RCS analysis results in a detailed depiction of the dose response as less than approximately 0.5 Gy. The 6 knot RCS models for the all-solid cancer mortality dose response of the whole dose or less than 2 Gy were selected with the AIC model selection criterion and fit significantly better (p < 0.05) than the linear (L) model. The usual RCS includes the L-global model but not the quadratic (Q) nor linear-quadratic (LQ) global models. The authors extended the RCS to include L or LQ global models by putting L or LQ constraints on the cubic spline in the lower and upper tails, and the best RCS model selected with AIC criterion was the usual RCS with L-constraints in both the lower and upper tails. The selected RCS had a linear dose-response model in the lower dose range (i.e., < 0.2-0.3 Gy) and was compatible with the linear no-threshold (LNT) model in this dose range. The proposed method is also useful in describing the dose response of a specific cancer or non-cancer disease incidence/mortality.",Excluded
1692,"The prognostic significance of the treatment response of regional lymph nodes and the refinement of the current TNM staging system in locally advanced rectal cancer after neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy The current TNM staging system uses the same category definitions for both rectal cancer patients with and without neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy (NCRT). However, ypTNM stage, especially ypN stage does not predict patient survival after NCRT well. Whether tumor regression in lymph nodes (LRG) may improve the prediction has not been well studied. In total, 358 patients with rectal cancer who received NCRT followed by radical resection were recruited from 2004 to 2015, and the median follow-up time was 57.5 months. The main outcome measure was disease-free survival (DFS). In univariate analysis, factors associated with DFS were ypT stage, ypN stage, number of negative lymph nodes (NLN), lymph node ratio (LNR), tumor regression grade (TRG), M-TTRG (modified ypT stage by combining ypT stage and TRG), maximum LRG (LRGmax), sum score of LRG (LRGsum), LRG ratio (average value of LRGsum), and M-NLRG (modified ypN stage by combining LRGmax and LNR). In the multivariate Cox regression analysis, M-TTRG and M-NLRG (p < 0.001 and p = 0.030, respectively) were significantly associated with DFS. The estimated 5-year DFS rates were 86.6%, 60.3%, and 36.4% for patients with M-NLRG-0, M-NLRG-1, and M-NLRG-2, respectively (p < 0.001). A significant difference in survival was observed among patients with NCRT after incorporating TRG and LRG simultaneously into the current ypTNM staging system (p < 0.001). LRG was an important prognostic factor in rectal cancer patients treated with NCRT and could refine the ypTNM staging system.

2016,"Experience with wound complications after surgery for sacral tumors Purpose: The aim of this article is to summarize our experience in treating sacral wound complications after sacrectomy. We focus, in particular, on factors associated with wound complications, including surgical site infection (SSI) and wound dehiscence. Method(s): The definition of SSI devised by Horgan et al. was applied. Wound dehiscence was defined as a wound showing breakdown in the absence of clinical signs meeting the diagnostic standard for SSI. Between September 1997 and August 2009, 387 patients with a sacral tumor underwent sacrectomy performed by the same team of surgeons and were followed up for >=12 months. Potential risk factors were evaluated for univariate associations with SSI and wound complications. Multivariable conditional logistic regression was used to identify the combined effects of several risk factors. Result(s): Of the 387 wounds studied, 274 healed uneventfully, and 113 (29.2 %) broke down because of infection or dehiscence. Fifty-one (13.2 %) patients developed a postoperative SSI, and 62 (16.0 %) patients developed wound dehiscence. Gram-negative bacteria grew in 45 cultures (91.8 %) and included 38 cases of Escherichia coli. Previous radiation, rectum rupture, longer duration of surgery, and cerebrospinal fluid leakage were significantly associated with increased likelihood of developing an SSI. Previous radiation, rectum rupture, age <40 years, history of diabetes mellitus, maximum tumor diameter >=10 cm, and instrumentation used were risk factors for wound complications. Conclusion(s): The incidence of wound complications is not so high at a musculoskeletal tumor center with surgeons experienced in treating sacral tumors. Controlling for these risk factors when possible may improve clinical outcomes. © 2013 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.",Excluded
1095,"Quantification and characterization of radical production in human, animal and 3D skin models during sun irradiation measured by EPR spectroscopy Sun radiation is indispensable to our health, however, a long term and high exposure could lead to erythema, premature skin aging and promotion of skin tumors. An underlying pathomechanism is the formation of free radicals. First, reactive oxygen species (*OH, *O2 -) and then, secondary lipid oxygen species (C centered radicals, CCR) are formed. A high amount of free radicals results in oxidative stress with subsequent cell damage. In dermatological research different skin models are used, however, comparative data about the cutaneous radical formation are missing. In this study, the radical formation in porcine-, (SKH-1) murine-, human- ex vivo skin and reconstructed human skin (RHS) were investigated during simulated sun irradiation (305-2200 nm), with X-band EPR spectroscopy. The amount of radical formation was investigated with the spin probe PCA exposed to a moderate sun dose below one minimal erythema dose (MED, ~25 mJ/cm2 UVB) in all skin models. Furthermore, the *OH and *CCR radical concentrations were measured with the spin trap DMPO within 0-4 MED (porcine-, human skin and RHS). The highest amount of radicals was found in RHS followed by murine and porcine, and the lowest amount in human ex vivo skin. In all skin models, more *OH than CCR radicals were found at 0-4 MED. Additionally, this work addresses the limitations in the characterization with the spin trap DMPO. The measurements have shown that the most comparable skin model to in vivo human skin could differ depending on the focus of the investigation. If the amount of radial production is regarded, RHS seems to be in a similar range like in vivo human skin. If the investigation is focused on the radical type, porcine skin is most comparable to ex vivo human skin, at an irradiation dose not exceeding 1 MED. Here, no comparison to in vivo human skin is possible.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.",Excluded

462,"Subclinical carotid atherosclerosis and early vascular aging from long-term low-dose ionizing radiation exposure: a genetic, telomere, and vascular ultrasound study in cardiac catheterization laboratory staff OBJECTIVES: This study sought to assess the association between long-term radiation exposure in the catheterization laboratory (cath lab) and early signs of subclinical atherosclerosis. BACKGROUND: There is growing evidence of an excess risk of cardiovascular disease at low-dose levels of ionizing radiation exposure. METHODS: Left and right carotid intima-media thickness (CIMT) was measured in 223 cath lab personnel (141 male; age, 45 +/- 8 years) and 222 unexposed subjects (113 male; age, 44+/-10 years). Leukocyte telomere length (LTL) was evaluated by quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction. The DNA repair gene XRCC3 Thr241Met polymorphism was also analyzed to explore the possible interaction with radiation exposure. The occupational radiological risk score (ORRS) was computed for each subject on the basis of the length of employment, individual caseload, and proximity to the radiation source. A complete lifetime effective dose (mSv) was recorded for 57 workers. RESULTS: Left, right, and averaged CIMTs were significantly increased in high-exposure workers compared with both control subjects and low-exposure workers (all p values<0.04). On the left side, but not on the right, there was a significant correlation between CIMT and ORRS (p=0.001) as well as lifetime dose (p=0.006). LTL was significantly reduced in exposed workers compared with control subjects (p=0.008). There was a significant correlation between LTL and both ORRS (p=0.002) and lifetime dose (p=0.03). The XRCC3 Met241 allele presented a significant interaction with high exposure for right side (pinteraction=0.002), left side (pinteraction<0.0001), and averaged (pinteraction<0.0001) CIMTs. CONCLUSIONS: Long-term radiation exposure in a cath lab may be associated with increased subclinical CIMT and telomere length shortening, suggesting evidence of accelerated vascular aging and early atherosclerosis.",Included
2760,"Strategic lithotripsy using the Doli S EMSE 220 F-XP for the management of staghorn renal calculi Aim: The presentation of our results using the Dornier lithotripter (Doli) S electromagnetic shockwave emitter (EMSE) 220 F-XP for the strategic management of staghorn renal calculi. Method(s): Sixteen patients with renal staghorn stones of more than 35 mm in maximum length on plain X-rays were treated by shock wave lithotripsy (SWL) monotherapy with the Doli S EMSE 220 F-XP. Double-J ureteral stent was inserted to all prior to the first SWL treatment. Shock wave counts varied from 2,500 to 3,600 with a shock release frequency of 70-80 pulses per minute. The number of sessions varied from 2 to 6. The interval between the SWL sessions was around 1 month. Fragmentation rate of 20-25% of the stone load per session was considered a valid criterion for progressing to further SWL sessions. Result(s): Nine patients became stone free at the end of SWL sessions and two patients had renal stone fragments smaller than 4 mm, which were eliminated 6 months later. Two patients developed streinstrasse that was managed with ureteroscopy. Auxiliary SWL was also performed on three patients with residual ureteral calculi. The mean follow up period was 12 months. The remaining five patients underwent open surgery for incomplete stone fragmentation. No major complications developed during the follow up period. The predominant composition of stones available for analysis was struvite. Conclusion(s): Doli S EMSE 220 F-XP can be a safe and effective treatment option for renal staghorn stones on an outpatient basis. © 2010 Springer Science+Business Media, B.V.",Excluded
816,"Impact of age on the selection of nuclear cardiology stress protocols: The INCAPS (IAEA nuclear cardiology protocols) study BACKGROUND: There is growing concern about radiation exposure from nuclear myocardial perfusion imaging (MPI), particularly among younger patients who are more prone to develop untoward effects of ionizing radiation, and hence US and European professional society guidelines recommend age as a consideration in weighing radiation risk from MPI. We aimed to determine how patient radiation doses from MPI vary across age groups in a large contemporary international cohort. METHODS: Data were collected as part of a global cross-sectional study of centers performing MPI coordinated by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). Sites provided information on each MPI study completed during a single week in March-April 2013. We compared across age groups laboratory adherence to pre-specified radiation-related best practices, radiation effective dose (ED; a whole-body measure reflecting the amount of radiation to each organ and its relative sensitivity to radiation's deleterious effects), and the proportion of patients with ED<=9mSv, a target level specified in guidelines. RESULTS: Among 7911 patients undergoing MPI in 308 laboratories in 65 countries, mean ED was 10.0+/-4.5mSv with slightly higher exposure among younger age groups (trend p value<0.001). There was no difference in the proportion of patients with ED<=9mSv across age groups, or in adherence to best practices based on the median age of patients in a laboratory. CONCLUSIONS: In contemporary nuclear cardiology practice, the age of the patient appears not to impact protocol selection and radiation dose, contrary to professional society guidelines.",Excluded
1041,"Effect of gamma radiation on the biology of the flesh fly, Parasarcophaga argyrostoma. I. Following larval exposure One and seven days old larvae of the flesh fly, Parasarcophaga argyrostoma were exposed to doses ranging from 1-90 Gy. Lower doses ranging from 1-9 Gy applied to young larvae accelerate larval development whereas old larvae responded to doses from 10-90 Gy by a remarkable retardation of the larval and pupal development. Reduction in percentage pupation and adult emergence were noticed with increment in the radiation doses applied. This reduction was higher for irradiated seven days old larvae than the one day old larvae at all doses applied, indicating that young larvae were more susceptible to gamma radiation than the older one. At higher doses (30-70 Gy) the pupae could not continue their development and died within 17 days after pupation. The longevity of adults resulted from irradiated larvae was decreased by increasing the radiation dosage and it was found that adults emerging from irradiated young larvae lived shorter than those from irradiated young ones, the fecundity of adults resulted from irradiated larvae was also decreased by gamma irradiation exposures. The percentage reduction of larviposition was 100% for irradiated females with 8 Gy while that of irradiated males was 97.5% indicating that females were more sensitive to radiation than males.",Excluded

2622,"Temporal and spatial melanoma trends in austria: An ecological study Annual solar ultraviolet radiation (UVR) is mostly determined by latitude and altitude. Over the last decades, increasing UVR ground levels have been observed. Exposure to UVR is associated with a life-time risk to develop melanoma, a malign skin cancer. Thus, we hypothesized that melanoma incidence in Austria is associated with altitude of place of living and time of diagnosis. We investigated this hypothesis in an ecological study by district and year for Austrian melanoma incidence (1990-2010) and mortality (1970-2011) data. As expected, incidence rates increased with altitude (about 2% per 10 m) and year (about 2%). Additionally, melanoma incidence rates were about 50% higher in urban than in rural districts. In contrast, mortality rates decreased with altitude (for males: 0.4% per 10 m, for women: 0.7% per 10 m, respectively). The observed discrepancy between incidence and mortality data could partly be explained by melanoma diagnosis at earlier tumor stage in districts with higher altitude. Possible reasons for this finding include higher awareness of patients, better diagnostic performance of medical professionals working at higher altitudes, or slower tumor growth due to protective effects of sun light-associated vitamin D synthesis. © 2014 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.",Excluded

2628,"Effect of chemoradiotherapy vs chemotherapy on survival in patients with locally advanced pancreatic cancer controlled after 4 months of gemcitabine with or without erlotinib the LAP07 randomized clinical trial Importance In locally advanced pancreatic cancer, the role of chemoradiotherapy is controversial and the efficacy of erlotinib is unknown. OBJECTIVES To assess whether chemoradiotherapy improves overall survival of patients with locally advanced pancreatic cancer controlled after 4 months of gemcitabine-based induction chemotherapy and to assess the effect of erlotinib on survival. DESIGN, SETTING,ANDPARTICIPANTS InLAP07, an international, open-label, phase3randomized trial, 449 patientswere enrolled between 2008and 2011. Follow-up ended in February 2013. INTERVENTIONS In the first randomization, 223 patients received 1000mg/m2 weekly of gemcitabine alone and 219 patients received 1000mg/m2 of gemcitabine plus 100mg/d of erlotinib. In the second randomization involving patients with progression-free disease after 4 months, 136 patients received 2 months of the same chemotherapy and 133 underwent chemoradiotherapy (54 Gy plus capecitabine). MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES The primary outcomewas overall survival from the date of the first randomization. Secondary outcomeswere the effect of erlotinib and quality assurance of radiotherapy on overall survival, progression-free survival of gemcitabine-erlotinib and erlotinib maintenance with gemcitabine alone at the second randomization, and toxic effects. RESULTS A total of 442 of the 449 patients (232 men; median age, 63.3 years) enrolled underwent the first randomization. Of these, 269 underwent the second randomization. Interim analysis was performed when 221 patients died (109 in the chemoradiotherapy group and 112 in the chemotherapy group), reaching the early stopping boundaries for futility. With a median follow-up of 36.7 months, the median overall survival from the date of the first randomization was not significantly different between chemotherapy at 16.5 months (95%CI, 14.5-18.5 months) and chemoradiotherapy at 15.2 months (95%CI, 13.9-17.3 months; hazard ratio [HR], 1.03; 95%CI, 0.79-1.34; P =.83). Median overall survival from the date of the first randomization for the 223 patients receiving gemcitabine was 13.6 months (95%CI, 12.3-15.3 months) and was 11.9 months (95%CI, 10.4-13.5 months) for the 219 patients receiving gemcitabine plus erlotinib (HR, 1.19; 95%CI, 0.97-1.45; P =.09; 188 deaths vs 191 deaths). Chemoradiotherapy was associated with decreased local progression (32%vs 46%, P =.03) and no increase in grade 3 to 4 toxicity, except for nausea. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE In this open-label, randomized trial involving patients with locally advanced pancreatic cancer with disease controlled after 4 months of induction chemotherapy, there was no significant difference in overall survival with chemoradiotherapy compared with chemotherapy alone and there was no significant difference in overall survival with gemcitabine compared with gemcitabine plus erlotinib used as maintenance therapy.Copyright © 2016 American Medical Association.

3597,"A Retrospective Review of Re-irradiating Patients' Recurrent High-grade Gliomas Aims: After radical treatment, most high-grade gliomas (HGG) recur locally. Upon recurrence, no standard treatment exists. Options include re-resection, salvage systemic therapy and re-irradiation. This retrospective study evaluated patients who underwent re-irradiation for recurrent HGGs and assessed prognostic factors and their influence on management. Material(s) and Method(s): Eighty-two patients who underwent re-irradiation for HGG from 2009 to 2014 were retrospectively identified. Re-irradiation consisted of either standard three-dimensional conformal, intensity-modulated radiotherapy or highly conformal stereotactic radiotherapy using mostly volumetric modulated arc therapy. Patient survival from re-irradiation was the primary end point. Survival was estimated via the Kaplan-Meier method with differences assessed using the Log-rank test; hazard ratios were estimated using Cox regression analysis. Result(s): The median overall survival from re-irradiation was 9.5 months. Re-irradiation, to a median dose of 35 Gy in 10 fractions, was well tolerated: 4% developed grade 3 toxicity, no patients experienced grade >=4 or radionecrosis. In the multivariate analysis, factors significantly associated with increased survival included: longer duration from initial radiotherapy, better performance status at re-irradiation of 0-1 versus >=2, unifocal versus multifocal recurrence and higher total re-irradiation dose (>=35 Gy versus <35 Gy). Re-resection, salvage systemic therapy and age were unrelated to survival. Conclusion(s): Patients with recurrent HGG tolerated re-irradiation well with minimal toxicity. Those patients in good prognostic groups, including good performance status can achieve durable control, suggesting managing patients with regular magnetic resonance imaging surveillance post-radical treatment, identifying early radiological progression and instituting salvage therapy when performance status is best.Copyright © 2018 The Royal College of Radiologists",Excluded

The rendez-vous endoscopic approach had already been described for complex stenoses as an alternative to surgery that has high morbid-mortality. AIMS & METHODS: This is a case series report about six patients referred for complete esophageal disruption classified in two groups: 1/ Long disruption (> 5cm), one after caustic ingestion and two due to an esophageal stripping during SEMS removal. Two had an associated loss of the SES; 2/ Short disruption (< 5cm), consecutive to radiation therapy for a neck neoplasia. They had been fasting for 3 to 18 months. All the procedures were performed according the anterograde retrograde approach, under anesthesia and with CO2 insufflation and X-rays guidance. RESULT(S): There were 3 men and women between 25 and 71 years old. All the reconstructions have been successful in one to three endoscopic sessions, using the non hydrophilic tip of a guide wire passed through a straight catheter in 5 cases and a EUS needle in only one case. In 2 cases, a neo-SES had to be created, by transillumination (n=1) or head and neck surgery (n=1). In order to guide the reconstruction, SEMS was used in one case, NGT in one case, and both were used in one patient. The first dilation was performed with a CRE balloon (12-15mm). All the patients could eat mixed after 2 POD. There was no intraoperative or post-operative complication. Then, the patients underwent 3 to 18 dilations sessions during 1.5 to 15 months; two are still undergoing dilations and all eat normally. CONCLUSION(S): Endoscopic rendez-vous for esophageal reconstruction is safe and effective in case of esophageal disruption even with loss of SES, avoiding surgery.",Excluded
3147,"Patterns of relapse in patients with high grade glioma receiving combined treatments including stereotactic re-irradiation for a first relapse Purpose Bevacizumab and stereotactic treatment are efficient combined or alone in relapse glioma. However, patterns of relapse after this kind of salvage treatment have never been studied. The purpose of this unicentric retrospective analysis was to assess and understand the patterns of relapse of high grade glioma treated with stereotactic radiation, with or without bevacizumab. Patients and methods Twenty patients with high grade glioma relapse received a stereotactic radiation; among them two patients received temozolomide and eight patients received bevacizumab; among the latter, four received also irinotecan. We matched the stereotactic radiation treatment planning scan with the images of the first treatment and of the second relapse in order to determine the patterns of failure and associate dosimetric profile. Results For the total population, median follow-up from the first diagnosis and relapse were 46.1 and 17.6 months, respectively. Among the 13 patients who relapsed, ten did not receive chemotherapy and three received it (P < 0.05), two received temozolomide and one bevacizumab. Patients who received bevacizumab had no ""out-of-field"" recurrences. Among the 32 irradiated relapses, 15 were ""in-field"" recurrences; among them two were treated with bevacizumab and 13 were not (P < 0.05). For the 32 lesions, a favourable prognostic factor of control was the association of a high-dose of irradiation and the use of bevacizumab. Conclusion For patients with relapsed high grade glioma, local control was higher with combined bevacizumab and high-dose stereotactic radiation.Copyright © 2016",Excluded
306,"Diagnostic accuracy of 320-row computed tomography as compared with invasive coronary angiography in unselected, consecutive patients with suspected coronary artery disease Noninvasive coronary angiography with multislice computed tomography (CT) scanners is feasible with high sensitivity and negative predictive value. The radiation exposure associated with this technique, however, is high and concerns in the widespread use of CT have arisen. We evaluated the diagnostic accuracy of coronary angiography using 320-row CT, which avoids exposure-intensive overscanning and overranging. We prospectively studied 118 unselected consecutive patients with suspected coronary artery disease (CAD) referred for invasive coronary angiography (ICA). All patients had 320-row CT within 1 week of ICA, which, together with quantitative analysis, served as the reference standard. Of the 65 out of 118 patients who were diagnosed as having CAD by ICA, 64 (98 %) were correctly identified at 320-row CT. Noteworthy, 320-row CT correctly detected CAD in 3 patients with atrial fibrillation and ruled out the disease in the other 8 patients. From 151 significant coronary stenoses detected on ICA, 137 (91 %) were correctly identified with 320-row CT. In the per-patient analysis, sensitivity and specificity of 320-row CT were 98 and 91 %, respectively. In the per-vessel analysis, sensitivity and specificity of 320-row CT were 93 and 95 %, respectively. In the per segment analysis, sensitivity and specificity of 320-row CT were 91 and 99 %, respectively. Diameter stenosis determined with the use of CT showed good correlation with ICA (P < 0.001, R = 0.81) without significant underestimation or overestimation (-3.1 +/- 24.4 %; P = 0.08). Comparison of CT with ICA revealed a significantly smaller effective radiation dose (3.1 +/- 2.3 vs. 6.5 +/- 4.2 mSv; P < 0.05) and amount of contrast agent required (99 +/- 51 vs. 65 +/- 42 ml, P < 0.05) for 320 row CT. The present study in an unselected population including patients with atrial fibrillation demonstrates that 320-row CT may significantly reduce the radiation dose and amount of contrast agent required compared with ICA while maintaining a very high diagnostic accuracy.",Excluded
1383,"Informatics in radiology: use of a C-arm fluoroscopy simulator to support training in intraoperative radiography Mobile image intensifier systems (C-arms) are used frequently in orthopedic and reconstructive surgery, especially in trauma and emergency settings, but image quality and radiation exposure levels may vary widely, depending on the extent of the C-arm operator's knowledge and experience. Current training programs consist mainly of theoretical instruction in C-arm operation, the physical foundations of radiography, and radiation avoidance, and are largely lacking in hands-on application. A computer-based simulation program such as that tested by the authors may be one way to improve the effectiveness of C-arm training. In computer simulations of various scenarios commonly encountered in the operating room, trainees using the virtX program interact with three-dimensional models to test their knowledge base and improve their skill levels. Radiographs showing the simulated patient anatomy and surgical implants are ""reconstructed"" from data computed on the basis of the trainee's positioning of models of a C-arm, patient, and table, and are displayed in real time on the desktop monitor. Trainee performance is signaled in real time by color graphics in several control panels and, on completion of the exercise, is compared in detail with the performance of an expert operator. Testing of this computer-based training program in continuing medical education courses for operating room personnel showed an improvement in the overall understanding of underlying principles of intraoperative radiography performed with a C-arm, with resultant higher image quality, lower overall radiation exposure, and greater time efficiency.

1974,"Size-specific dose estimates for chest, abdominal, and pelvic CT: Effect of intrapatient variability in water-equivalent diameter Purpose: To develop software to automatically calculate size-specific dose estimates (SSDEs) and to assess the effect of variations in water-equivalent diameter (Dw) along the z-axis on SSDE for computed tomographic (CT) examinations of the torso. Material(s) and Method(s): In this institutional review board-approved, HIPAA-compliant, retrospective study, a software program was used to calculate Dw at each image position in 102 consecutive CT examinations of the combined chest, abdomen, and pelvis. SSDE was calculated by multiplying the size-dependent conversion factor and volume CT dose index (CTDIvol) at each image position. The variations in Dw along the z-axis were determined for six hypothetical scanning ranges: chest alone; abdomen alone; pelvis alone; chest and abdomen; abdomen and pelvis; and chest, abdomen, and pelvis. Mean SSDE was calculated in two ways: (a) from the SSDE at each position and (b) from the mean CTDIvol over each scan range and the conversion factor corresponding to Dw at the middle of the scan range. Linear regression analysis was performed to determine the correlation between SSDE values calculated in these two ways.

3144,"Ossification of the thoracic posterior longitudinal ligament in a fixed population. Radiological and neurological manifestations Reportedly, ossification of the posterior longitudinal ligament (OPLL) usually involves the cervical spine and often accompanies other ligamentous ossification such as diffuse idiopathic skeletal hyperostosis (DISH). It is considered serious because it sometimes causes severe radiculomyelopathy; however, the present study, based on a fixed population sample, revealed that OPLL of the thoracic spine is nearly always asymptomatic. The prevalence of thoracic OPLL was 0.6%, with three times as many women as men being affected, compared with cervical OPLL which occurs predominantly among men. No marked radiculomyelopathy was observed, nor definite evidence of neurological involvement due to thoracic OPLL. DISH was rare, especially among women.",Excluded
924,"UV dose determines key characteristics of nonmelanoma skin cancer Basal cell carcinoma (BCC) and squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), known as nonmelanoma skin cancer (NMSC), are the most common cancers worldwide. Although many factors are involved in the pathogenesis of NMSC, UV radiation is an important risk factor. A fundamental question in skin cancer research is whether varying doses of total UV radiation influence key characteristics of NMSC. The hypothesis that differences in UV doses influence the BCC/ SCC ratio, number of tumors, and anatomic location of the tumor was investigated in 311 participants having 326 tumors and with exposure to a broad range of UV doses. An epidemiologic questionnaire was given to each participant soliciting detailed information on exposure to solar radiation. Environmental UVA and UVB doses were measured continually for 6 years at a permanent UV monitoring station. The total ratio of BCC/SCC was 3.5. Participants who received low and high UV doses had a BCC/SCC ratio of 4.2. Those who received very high UV doses had a ratio of 2.1. A very high UV dose was also associated with the doubling of the total number of tumors per person and a significantly increased risk of having SCC, a more aggressive malignancy. Tumors in sun-exposed areas (on the body) were more common in participants who received high and very high UV doses. The tumors in sun-protected areas were associated with exposure to lower levels of UV. This large-scale population study provides evidence that varying doses of UV radiation have a profound influence on key characteristics of NMSC.",Excluded
297,"Effects of medical diagnostic X-rays delivered at 0.01 or 0.05 mGy on human blood cells Background: Low-dose X-rays are commonly used in medical imaging to help in the diagnosis of diseases. However, the deleterious effects of exposure to medical diagnostic low-dose X-rays remain a highly debated topic. The objective was to study the effects of medical diagnostic X-rays on human blood cells. Material(s) and Method(s): We studied the effects of medical diagnostic low-dose X-rays (80 kVp), i.e.,0.01 or 0.05 mGy, after the in vitro exposure of human red blood cells (RBCs) and peripheral blood mononucleated cells (PBMCs).Cells with no irradiation served as the control group. The biological endpoints that were used to determine the effects of medical diagnostic low-dose X-rays were hemolysis for RBCs and mitochondrial membrane potential, lysosomes, and the cell cycle for PBMCs. Result(s): Our results showed no changes in the hemolysis of RBCs and mitochondrial membrane potential, lysosome, or cell cycle in cells exposed to these low doses of X-rays when compared to the corresponding nonirradiated cells at all harvest timepoints. Conclusion(s): These results suggested that there were no deleterious effects of diagnostic low-dose X-rays when human RBCs and PBMCs were exposed in vitro.Copyright © 2021, Ibn Sina Trust.

752,"Randomized trial of 90Sr/90Y beta-radiation versus placebo control for treatment of in-stent restenosis BACKGROUND: After conventional treatment of in-stent restenosis, the incidence of recurrent clinical restenosis may approach 40%. We report the first multicenter, blinded, and randomized trial of intracoronary radiation with the use of a 90Sr/90Y beta-source for the treatment of in-stent restenosis., METHODS AND RESULTS: After successful catheter-based treatment of in-stent restenosis, 476 patients were randomly assigned to receive an intracoronary catheter containing either 90Sr/90Y (n=244) or placebo (n=232) sources. The prescribed dose 2 mm from the center of the source was 18.4 Gy for vessels between 2.70 and 3.35 mm in diameter and 23.0 Gy for vessels between 3.36 and 4.0 mm. The primary end point, ie, clinically driven target-vessel revascularization by 8 months, was observed in 56 (26.8%) of the patients assigned to placebo and 39 (17.0%) of the patients assigned to radiation (P=0.015). The incidence of the composite including death, myocardial infarction, and target-vessel revascularization was observed in 60 (28.7%) of the patients assigned to placebo and 44 (19.1%) of the patients assigned to radiation (P=0.024). Binary 8-month angiographic restenosis (> or =50% diameter stenosis) within the entire segment treated with radiation was reduced from 45.2% in the placebo-treated patients to 28.8% in the 90Sr/90Y-treated patients (P=0.001). Stent thromboses occurred in 1 patient assigned to placebo <24 hours after the procedure and in 1 patient assigned to 90Sr/90Y at day 244., CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study demonstrated that beta-radiation using 90Sr/90Y is both safe and effective for preventing recurrence in patients with in-stent restenosis.",Included
393,"[Phosphorylation of histone H2AX in human lymphocytes as a possible marker of effective cellular response to ionizing radiation] DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) which occurs in cells after ionizing radiation (IR) or chemical agents are the most dangerous lesions in eukariotic cells, which leads to cell death or chromosome abberations and cancer. One of the earliest response of cells to DSBs formation is phosphorylation by 139 serine of core variant histone H2AX in megabase chromatin domains around DSB (gamma-H2AX), which amplify signal and makes it possible to identify even one DSB in genome. Effective formation of gamma-H2AX is very important for maintenance of genome stability. Here, using immunofluorescent and Western blotting techniques, we studied dynamics of gamma-H2AX formation in human lymphocytes of various individuals irradiated ex vivo. We have found that dynamics of gamma-H2AX formation in lymphocytes differ between individuals but have similar kinetics and statistically is independent on people age.",Included

SD series were reconstructed using FBP. RD series were reconstructed with FBP, ASIR, and MBIR (Veo). Three readers-blinded to clinical history and comparison studies-reviewed all series, identifying liver lesions >=4 mm. Non-blinded review by two experienced abdominal radiologists-assessing SD against available clinical and radiologic information-established the reference standard., RESULTS: RD-CECT mean effective dose was 2.01 +/- 1.36 mSv (median, 1.71), a 64.1 +/- 8.8 % reduction. Pooled per-patient performance data were (sensitivity/specificity/PPV/NPV/accuracy) 0.91/0.78/0.60/0.96/0.81 for SD-FBP compared with RD-FBP 0.79/0.75/0.54/0.91/0.76; RD-ASIR 0.84/0.75/0.56/0.93/0.78; and RD-MBIR 0.84/0.68/0.49/0.92/0.72. ROC AUC values were 0.896/0.834/0.858/0.854 for SD-FBP/RD-FBP/RD-ASIR/RD-MBIR, respectively. RD-FBP (P = 0.002) and RD-MBIR (P = 0.032) AUCs were significantly lower than those of SD-FBP; RD-ASIR was not (P = 0.052). Reader confidence was lower for all RD series (P < 0.001) compared with SD-FBP, especially when calling patients entirely negative., CONCLUSIONS: Aggressive CT dose reduction resulted in inferior diagnostic performance and reader confidence for detection of low-contrast liver lesions compared to SD. Relative to RD-ASIR, RD-FBP showed decreased sensitivity and RD-MBIR showed decreased specificity., KEY POINTS: * Reduced-dose CECT demonstrates inferior diagnostic performance for detecting low-contrast liver lesions. * Reader confidence is lower with reduced-dose CECT compared to standard-dose CECT. * Overly aggressive dose reduction may result in misdiagnosis, regardless of reconstruction algorithm. * Careful consideration of perceived risks versus benefits of dose reduction is crucial.",Excluded
651,"Integrated resistance and aerobic exercise protects fitness during bed rest INTRODUCTION: The current exercise countermeasures have not fully protected astronauts' preflight aerobic and muscular fitness levels during International Space Station (ISS) missions, prompting a need to optimize the exercise prescription to improve or maintain astronauts' ability to perform critical tasks and eventually extend the duration of missions., PURPOSE: To test the hypothesis that an integrated resistance and aerobic exercise prescription performed with exercise equipment similar to that on the ISS can be tolerated and maintain cardiovascular and muscular fitness during 14 d of exposure to a model of microgravity., METHODS: Subjects (n = 9) participated in 14-21 d of pre-bed rest training and familiarization, 14 d of bed rest + iRAT exercise, and 7 d of ambulatory recovery. Peak aerobic capacity (VO2peak), ventilatory threshold (VT), and isokinetic and leg press tests were performed before and after bed rest to evaluate cardiovascular and muscle functions. Muscle cross-sectional area (CSA) was determined before, during, and after bed rest using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)., RESULTS: Improvements from before to after bed rest were observed in VO2peak (2.8 +/- 0.2 to 3.2 +/- 0.2 L.min(-1)), VT (1.9 +/- 0.2 to 2.1 +/- 0.2 L.min(-1)), leg muscle power (1582 +/- 317 to 1740 +/- 359 W), and muscle CSA of the grouped vastus lateralis, vastus intermedius, and vastus medialis muscles (67.5 +/- 8.4 to 68.9 +/- 8.3 cm). Muscle strength and total CSA of the upper and lower legs were not different from before to after bed rest., CONCLUSIONS: This is the first report of exercise being completely effective for the prevention of cardiovascular and skeletal muscle deconditioning during strict bed rest using exercise equipment similar to that on the ISS.

2103,"Evaluation of PRRT after selective catheterization of the hepatic artery as established technique ('Aretaieion' Protocol) using 111In-DTPA-Phe1 octreotide in inoperable liver metastases due to neuroendocrine tumors Aim/Introduction: To evaluate the efficacy of Auger and Internal Conversion Electron Emission of 111In-DTPA-Phe1-Octreotide and their tumoricidal effectiveness due to their high LET, in inoperable liver metastases, positive for sst2 receptor over-expression (verified by Octreoscan and confirmed by biopsy) due to neuroendocrine tumours (NETs). Material(s) and Method(s): In 86 patients 111In-DTPA-Phe1-Octreotide was implemented after selective catheterization of the hepatic artery, in an average activity of 6.3+/-1.3 GBq per patient/ per session, consecutively, with a time interval between sessions of 6-8 weeks. Infusion repetition did not exceed the 12 sessions. Patients, being under repeated Sandostatin-LAR treatment (30 mg per 20 days) did not discontinued the dosage but they were intramuscularly injected 15-20 days prior to the radioactive session. To reduce myelotoxicity, 75 mg of DTPA in trip-trop diluted in about 200 ml normal saline water was infused 30 min before the initialization of the radiopeptide therapy, lasting for about 4 hrs. For the assessment of response, RECIST 1.1 standards were used. CT/MRI scans before, during and after the end of the whole procedure, as well as U/S images at monthly basis were performed. Absorbed doses delivered to metastases, kidneys and red marrow were calculated according to OLINDA/EXM 1.1 program. Toxicity (World Health Organization criteria) was measured using blood and urine tests of renal, hepatic and bone marrow function. Result(s): Three patients resulted in complete response (3.5%); partial response was assessed in 46 (53.5 %), disease stabilization in 21 (24.4 %) and progressive disease in 16 (18.6%). The median PFS and OS were estimated to be 32 and 47.5 months, respectively. The organ average radiation dose was estimated as follows: (a) Liver Tumor 15.2 mGy/MBq, (b) Liver 0.14 mGy/MBq, (c) Kidneys 0.41 mGy/ MBq, (d) Spleen 1.4 mGy/MBq and (f ) Bone marrow 0.0032 mGy/MBq. The average absorbed dose per session to a tumour for a spherical mass of 10 gr was estimated to be 10.8 mGy/MBq, depending on the histotype of the tumour. WHO toxicity grade 2 to 3 erythro-, leuko-and thrombocytopenia occurred in 9 (10.5%) cases observed about after the 3rd session. Conclusion(s): In unresectable metastatic liver lesions, positive for somatostatin receptors, repeated, transhepatic high doses of 111In-DTPA-Phe1-Octreotide resulted in an optimal therapeutic outcome with a disease control (CR+PR+SD) in an about 82 % of the treated patients. Thus, 111In-DTPA-Phe1-Octreotide, intra-arterially applied, can be considered as a potent candidate in the therapeutic pharetra against NETs.",Excluded
2637,"Alternating radiotherapy and chemotherapy for inoperable stage III non- small-cell lung cancer: Long-term results of two phase II GOTHA trials Purpose/Objective: To report on two consecutive Phase II cooperative trials in which we evaluated the combination of alternating hyperfractionated accelerated radiotherapy and cisplatin-based chemotherapy in inoperable Stage III non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Patients and Methods: Between February 1986 and September 1989, 65 patients were entered in the first trial (GOTHA I), and between December 1989 and October 1992 67 were enrolled in the second trial (GOTHA II). In both protocols, radiotherapy (RT) was administered twice daily, at 6 h intervals, 5 days a week, to a total dose of 63 Gy in 42 fractions of 1.5 Gy. RT was given during weeks 2, 3, 6, and 7, over an elapsed time of 6 weeks. In GOTHA I, three cycles of cisplatin, 60 mg/m2 day 1, mitomycin, 8 mg/m2 day 1, and vindesin 3 mg/m2 day 1 and the first day of the following week, were given during weeks 1, 5, and 9; in GOTHA II, cisplatin 70 mg/m2 day 1 and vinblastin 5 mg/m2 day 1 and the first day of the following week were given during weeks 1, 5, 9, 13, 17, and 21. Result(s): With a minimum follow-up of 3 years, the 1-, 2-, 5-, and 8-year overall survival probability was 56% (95% CI 47-64%), 27% (20-35%), 12% (7- 18%) and 9% (3-16%), respectively, with a median survival of 13.6 months (11.4-16.8). Median follow-up for survivors was 6 years (3.3-9.9). There were no survival differences between Stages IIIA and IIIB (p = 0.84), performance status 0, 1, 2 (p = 0.87), sex (p = 0.45) or between the two treatment protocols. At this time, 14 patients are alive, and 118 have died: 102 from NSCLC, 4 from acute toxicity, 2 from secondary surgery, 4 from other medical causes, and 6 from unknown causes. Correlation between response and long- term survival was poor, since of the 24 patients who survived 3 years or more, only 6 (25%) were classified as having a complete response; the remainder having either a partial response (11, 46%), no change (6, 25%), or 'progressive disease' (1,4%). First site of relapse was local in 31% of these cases, distant in 43%, local and distant in 15%, and unknown in 11%. Main grade 3-4 acute toxicities were nausea-vomiting (17%), mucositis (15%), leukopenia (41%), and thrombocytopenia (11%). Eight patients presented with grade 3-4 symptomatic lung radiation pneumopathy. Conclusion(s): Based on this experience with 132 patients, this combination of alternated RT and chemotherapy (CT) for inoperable Stage III NSCLC is feasible with acceptable toxicity, and long-term results suggest a gain in survival when compared to those obtained with conventional RT alone. However, the still high local and distant failure rates indicate that both local and systemic therapies need to be improved.",Excluded
1777,"Apollo Lunar Astronauts Show Higher Cardiovascular Disease Mortality: Possible Deep Space Radiation Effects on the Vascular Endothelium As multiple spacefaring nations contemplate extended manned missions to Mars and the Moon, health risks could be elevated as travel goes beyond the Earth's protective magnetosphere into the more intense deep space radiation environment. The primary purpose of this study was to determine whether mortality rates due to cardiovascular disease (CVD), cancer, accidents and all other causes of death differ in (1) astronauts who never flew orbital missions in space, (2) astronauts who flew only in low Earth orbit (LEO), and (3) Apollo lunar astronauts, the only humans to have traveled beyond Earth's magnetosphere. Results show there were no differences in CVD mortality rate between non-flight (9%) and LEO (11%) astronauts. However, the CVD mortality rate among Apollo lunar astronauts (43%) was 4-5 times higher than in non-flight and LEO astronauts. To test a possible mechanistic basis for these findings, a secondary purpose was to determine the long-term effects of simulated weightlessness and space-relevant total-body irradiation on vascular responsiveness in mice. The results demonstrate that space-relevant irradiation induces a sustained vascular endothelial cell dysfunction. Such impairment is known to lead to occlusive artery disease, and may be an important risk factor for CVD among astronauts exposed to deep space radiation.",Included
1278,"Elective lymph node irradiation with intensity-modulated radiotherapy: Is conventional dose fractionation necessary? Purpose: Intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) is the standard of care for head-and-neck cancer (HNC). We treated patients with HNC by delivering either a moderate hypofractionation (MHF) schedule (66 Gy at 2.2 Gy per fraction to the gross tumor [primary and nodal]) with standard dose fractionation (54-60 Gy at 1.8-2.0 Gy per fraction) to the elective neck lymphatics or a conventional dose and fractionation (CDF) schedule (70 Gy at 2.0 Gy per fraction) to the gross tumor (primary and nodal) with reduced dose to the elective neck lymphatics. We analyzed these two cohorts for treatment outcomes. Methods and Materials: Between November 2001 and February 2009, 89 patients with primary carcinomas of the oral cavity, larynx, oropharynx, hypopharynx, and nasopharynx received definitive IMRT with or without concurrent chemotherapy. Twenty patients were treated using the MHF schedule, while 69 patients were treated with the CDF schedule. Patient characteristics and dosimetry plans were reviewed. Patterns of failure including local recurrence (LR), regional recurrence (RR), distant metastasis (DM), disease-free survival (DFS), overall survival (OS), and toxicities, including rate of feeding tube placement and percentage of weight loss, were reviewed and analyzed. Result(s): Median follow-up was 31.2 months. Thirty-five percent of patients in the MHF cohort and 77% of patients in the CDF cohort received chemotherapy. No RR was observed in either cohort. OS, DFS, LR, and DM rates for the entire group at 2 years were 89.3%, 81.4%, 7.1%, and 9.4%, respectively. Subgroup analysis showed no significant differences in OS (p = 0.595), DFS (p = 0.863), LR (p = 0.833), or DM (p = 0.917) between these two cohorts. Similarly, no significant differences were observed in rates of feeding tube placement and percentages of weight loss. Conclusion(s): Similar treatment outcomes were observed for MHF and CDF cohorts. A dose of 50 Gy at 1.43 Gy per fraction may be sufficient to electively treat low-risk neck lymphatics. © 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.",Excluded
579,"Selecting the best noninvasive imaging test to guide treatment after an inconclusive exercise test Opinion statement: The first step towards approaching a patient with an inconclusive stress test is to identify the initial reason why a stress test was ordered and examine what factors led to inconclusive test results. Next, it is important to ask whether the patient will benefit from further testing, as not all patients with inconclusive test results require additional testing. In patients who are at low-to-intermediate risk, it may be useful to perform coronary CT angiography (CTA) to exclude the presence of obstructive coronary atherosclerosis. Among individuals with no prior history of coronary artery disease, a possible advantage of CTA is that if subclinical atherosclerosis is identified, intensification of lifestyle interventions, and often pharmacotherapy, should be advocated. On the other hand, in high-risk patients or individuals that already have coronary artery disease, the primary objective is to quantify the presence and magnitude of ischemia in order to define the potential role of coronary revascularization procedures. This can be achieved by myocardial perfusion imaging using nuclear imaging or cardiac MRI. Alternatively, a functional evaluation to identify stress-induced wall motion abnormalities using stress echocardiography or MRI can be obtained. In selecting which test to obtain, it is important to understand the strengths and limitations of different imaging tests and to consider patient factors (e.g., body habitus) that may influence the accuracy of various tests. In addition, physicians should consider whether there are any other clinical questions that require imaging. For instance, cardiac MRI may be used to evaluate for infiltrative myocardial disease or pericardial disease whereas cardiac CT can evaluate for lung pathology or diseases of the aorta. Finally, any decision regarding what type of additional testing to obtain should also be based on knowing the local expertise and availability of various testing options. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.",Excluded

However, despite the benefits of medical radiation exposures, adverse long-term health effects are cause for concern. Protein and gene biomarkers are early indicators of cellular response after low-dose exposure. We examined DNA damage by quantifying gamma-H2AX foci and expression of twelve candidate genes in the blood lymphocytes of patients exposed to low doses of X-radiation during neuro-interventional procedures. Entrance surface dose (ESD; 10.92-1062.55 mGy) was measured by thermoluminescence dosimetry (TLD). Absorbed dose was estimated using gamma-H2AX focus frequency and gene expression, with in vitro dose-response curves generated for the same biomarkers. gamma-H2AX foci in post-exposure samples were significantly higher than in pre-exposure samples. Among the genes analysed, FDXR, ATM, BCL2, MDM2, TNFSF9, and PCNA showed increased expression; CDKN1A, DDB2, SESN1, BAX, and TNFRSF10B showed unchanged or decreased expression. Absorbed dose, estimated based on gamma-H2AX focus frequency and gene expression changes, did not show any correlation with measured ESD. Patients undergoing interventional procedures receive considerable radiation doses, resulting in DNA damage and altered gene expression. Medical procedures should be carried out using the lowest radiation doses possible without compromising treatment. Copyright © 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",Excluded

After chest roentgenography and abdominopelvic CT, 99mTc-88BV59 was administered intravenously, planar and SPECT external imaging was performed 3 to 6 hr after injection and planar imaging was performed 18 to 24 hr after injection. Surgery was performed immediately after late planar imaging. OPS of a standardized list of sites to document background radiation activity and of tumor sites, resection margins and tumor beds was performed., RESULTS: The patients had 23 histologically proven tumor sites. Overall sensitivity for CT, planar RIS, SPECT, surgery and OPS was 43%, 61%, 78%, 96% and 91%, respectively. SPECT was superior to CT for imaging extrahepatic abdominal and pelvic disease. OPS detected all liver and extrahepatic abdominal tumor sites and correctly predicted histological tumor-free margins and tumor beds in all cases. OPS did not identify tumor deposits that the surgeon could neither see nor feel. No patient demonstrated human anti-human immune responsiveness 1 and 3 mo after 99mTc-88BV59 infusion., CONCLUSION: Technetium-99m-88BV59 is a safe, effective radioimmunoconjugate for colorectal cancer imaging, with superior sensitivity as compared to CT.",Excluded

We have compared three schedules of non-platinum-based CT plus either radiotherapy or chemoradiation. From May 2001 to June 2006, 158 patients with unresectable stage III NSCLC were enrolled in a randomized phase II trial with overall response rate (ORR) as the primary endpoint. The initial design included three arms: sequential CT followed by thoracic radiation (TRT); concurrent CT/TRT followed by consolidation CT; and induction CT followed by concurrent CT/TRT. However, based on the preliminary results of the RTOG 9410 trial, the sequential arm was closed when 19 patients had been enrolled.

With improvements in systemic therapy, patients are living longer and are at risk for both late (defined as CloseSPigtSPi 18 months after SRS) tumor recurrence and late ARE, which have not previously been well described. An IRB-approved, retrospective review identified patients treated with SRS who developed new MRI contrast enhancement CloseSPigtSPi 18 months following SRS. ARE was defined as stabilization/shrinkage of the lesion over time or pathologic confirmation of necrosis, without tumor. Local failure (LF) was defined as continued enlargement of the lesion over time or pathologic confirmation of tumor. We identified 16 patients, with a median follow-up of 48.2 months and median overall survival of 73.0 months, who had 19 metastases with late imaging changes occurring a median of 32.9 months (range 18.5-63.2 months) after SRS. Following SRS, 12 lesions had late ARE at a median of 33.2 months and 7 lesions had late LF occurring a median of 23.6 months.

Diagnostics, prophylaxis and correction of this condition demand new accurate and objective approaches. Here we report on an in vivo longitudinal monitoring of the oral mucosa dynamics in 25 patients during the course of radiotherapy of oropharyngeal and nasopharyngeal cancer using multifunctional optical coherence tomography (OCT). A spectral domain OCT system with a specially-designed oral imaging probe was used. Microvasculature visualization was based on temporal speckle variations of the full complex signal evaluated by high-pass filtering of 3D data along the slow scan axis. Angiographic image quantification demonstrated an increase of the vascular density and total length of capillary-like-vessels before visual signs or clinical symptoms of mucositis occur. Especially significant microvascular changes compared to their initial levels occurred when grade two and three mucositis developed. Further, microvascular reaction was seen to be dose-level dependent. OCT monitoring in radiotherapy offers a non-invasive, convenient, label-free quantifiable structural and functional volumetric imaging method suitable for longitudinal human patient studies, furnishing fundamental radiobiological insights and potentially providing useful feedback data to enable adaptive radiotherapy (ART).",Excluded

3294,"Radiation dose reduction with Sinogram Affirmed Iterative Reconstruction technique for abdominal computed tomography PURPOSE: The objective of this study was to assess the effect of Sinogram Affirmed Iterative Reconstruction (SAFIRE) and filtered back-projection (FBP) techniques on abdominal computed tomography (CT) performed with 50% and 75% radiation dose reductions., METHODS: Twenty-four patients (mean age, 64 +/- 14 years; male-female ratio, 10:14) gave informed consent for an institutional review board-approved prospective study involving acquisition of additional research images through the abdomen on 128-slice multi-detector-row CT (SOMATOM Definition Flash) at quality reference mAs of 100 (50% lower dose) and 50 (75% lower dose) over a scan length of 10 cm using combined modulation (CARE Dose 4D). Standard-of-care abdominal CT was performed at 200 quality reference mAs, with remaining parameters held constant. The 50- and 100-mAs data sets were reconstructed with FBP and at 4 SAFIRE settings (S1, S2, S3, S4). Higher number of SAFIRE settings denotes increased strength of the algorithm resulting in lower image noise. Two abdominal radiologists independently compared the FBP and SAFIRE images for lesion number, location, size and conspicuity, and visibility of small structures, image noise, and diagnostic confidence. Objective noise and Hounsfield units (HU) were measured in the liver and the descending aorta., RESULTS: All 43 lesions were detected on both FBP and SAFIRE images. Minor blocky, pixelated appearance of 50% and 75% reduced dose images was noted at S3 and S4 SAFIRE but not at S1 and S2 settings. Subjective noise was suboptimal in both 50% and 75% lower-dose FBP images but was deemed acceptable on all SAFIRE settings. Sinogram Affirmed Iterative Reconstruction images were deemed acceptable in all patients at 50% lower dose and in 22 of 24 patients at 75% lower dose. As compared with 75% reduced dose FBP, objective noise was lower by 22.8% (22.9/29.7), 35% (19.3/29.7), 44.3% (16.7/29.3), and 54.8% (13.4/29.7) on S1 to S4 settings, respectively (P < 0.001)., CONCLUSIONS: Sinogram Affirmed Iterative Reconstruction-enabled reconstruction provides abdominal CT images without loss in diagnostic value at 50% reduced dose and in some patients also at 75% reduced dose.",Excluded
3135,"Patient radiation dosimetry during interventional cardiac procedures Background: Cardiac catheterizaton plays an essental role in the evaluaton of suspected heart failure patents. This work aimed to determine the mean effectve dose of patents undergoing catheterizaton tests and to estmate the associated radiaton risk of malignancy. Material(s) and Method(s): Measurements were performed during 65 coronary angiographies (CA), 70 coronary angioplastes (PTCA) 27, radio fluoroscopy (RF) ablatons and 25 electro physiologies procedures in a dedicated laboratory. The procedures were undertaken with the Siemens and General Electric X-ray equipment. A dose area product (DAP) meter was also used. The DAP values and fluoroscopy tmes were recorded for each patent. Result(s): The mean DAP values and patent effectve doses were 19.53 Gy.cm2and 1.71 mSv for CA, 49.74 Gy.cm2 and 4.57 mSv for PTCA, 153.34 Gy.cm2and 16.38 mSv for ablatons and 14.88 Gy.cm2and 1.65 mSv for electrophysiology, respectvely. The patent radiaton risk was estmated at 13, 1.3, 1.3, 3.6 fatal cancer per 10000 procedures of ablatons, electrophysiology, CA and PTCA cases, respectvely. Conclusion(s): Results showed that the radiaton risk due to RF cardiac ablaton is higher than the other complicaton procedures so, efforts should be made to minimize patent radiaton risk from RF ablaton procedures. Also we found no clear correlaton between cardiologist level of experience and reduced level of patent's dose.Copyright © 2020 Novin Medical Radiation Institute. All rights reserved.",Excluded

1168,"Damage-induced apoptosis in primary human lymphocytes is a genetic program modified by gender and age Apoptosis is a core pathway deregulated in hematologic and other cancers. Although there are considerable functional and genetic data on the regulation of apoptosis in vitro and in model organisms, little is known about how these pathways are modified in primary cells freshly isolated from people, who are continually subjected to a variety of different and often unquantified environmental stimuli. We hypothesize that these exposures may have important and as yet unappreciated modifying effects on apoptosis that may have implications for cancer risk or response to therapy. To test this, we isolated peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from 90 normal healthy individuals and treated them with 5 Gy ionizing radiation (IR). Damage-induced apoptosis was measured at 24 hours after IR by TUNEL. We observed surprising heterogeneity in apoptosis among individuals, ranging from 21-65 percent. To determine whether this diversity in response was programmed or stochastic, we repeated the experiment 3 times in 10 individuals spanning the entire IR-induced apoptotic range and found results to be completely reproducible within individuals, suggesting that it resulted from a genetic program. We then assessed the association with individual characteristics. Whereas neither race nor age was associated with IR-induced apoptosis, gender was significantly associated (Mean: 44.8% vs 32.9%; p = 1.02 x 10-8). Moreover, when stratified by gender, age was significantly associated with IR-induced apoptosis in males (p = 0.026) but not females (p = 0.94). Thus, we conclude that IR-induced apoptosis in freshly isolated human PBMCs results from an intrinsic genetic program modified by age, but only within males. Genetic models to explain this will be discussed.",Included

Eighty-nine patients underwent hepatic dynamic CT using one of the 2 protocols: tube voltage of 120 kVp, contrast dose of 600 mgI/kg, and filtered back projection in Protocol A (n = 46), and tube voltage of 100 kVp, contrast dose of 500 mgI/kg, and AIDR 3D in Protocol B (n = 43). The volume CT dose index (CTDIvol) and size-specific dose estimates (SSDEs) were compared between the 2 groups. Objective image noise and tumor to liver contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR) were also compared. Three radiologists independently reviewed image quality. The jackknife alternative free-response receiver-operating characteristic (JAFROC) analysis was performed to compare diagnostic performance. The mean CTDIvol and SSDE of Protocol B (14.3 and 20.2, respectively) were significantly lower than those of Protocol A (22.1 and 31.4, P < .001). There were no significant differences in either objective image noise or CNR. In the qualitative analysis, 2 readers assigned significant lower scores to images of Protocol B for at least one of the 3 phases regarding overall image quality (P < .05).

1842,"Vertebral fracture assessment: A valid tool to detect vertebral fractures in elderly community Introduction: Vertebral fractures (VFx) are associated with higher morbidity and mortality, increasing the risk of incident fractures. Although only 30% of the VFx cause symptoms, this finding is a relevant issue for managing patients with high fracture risk, as well prevention of new fractures, independently of bone mineral density. Studies have shown effectiveness of Vertebral Fracture Assessment (VFA) to detect prevalent VFx comparable to the spine X-ray, considered as gold standard method. The aim of this study was to compare the performance between VFA and X-ray to identify VFx in healthy elderly men and women from community. Patients and Methods: 429 non-institutionalized subjects (60% women), aged over 65 years, from community (Butanta area, Sao Paulo, Brazil) were enrolled in this cohort. VFA by DXA measurements and spine X-ray (T4 to L4) were analyzed according to semiquantitative method (Genant HK, 1993). The first one was evaluated by two expert rheumatologists by consensus between them. The second one was evaluated by one expert radiologist. The interobserver correlation between VFA and spine X-ray to identify VFx was analyzed by kappa (k) scores. P<0.05 was set as significant. Result(s): The prevalence of VFx in both methods was 29.4%, without significant difference between men and women. Unavailable vertebrae were significantly lower in spine X-ray than VFA (1% and 5.5% respectively, p<0.001), especially among T4-T6. According to VFA, 5013 (96%) vertebrae were considered as normal, 144 (2.7%) had grade 1 fractures, 58 (1.1%) with grade 2 fractures and 12 (0.2) grade 3 fractures. To identify VFx, the sensitivity of VFA was 73% and the specificity was 99.1%. After excluding deformities grade 1, the sensitivity increased to 93% and specificity to 99.6%. The correlation between VFA and X-ray was good (k=0.74). Again, without grade 1, the agreement was also better (k=0.84). The correlation vertebrae by vertebrae between VFA and spine X-ray was lower in T5-T7. There was not significant difference between methods, according by gender (k=0.72 in men, k=0.75 in women). Conclusion. In elderly community, VFA had similar performance to conventional spine X-ray to identify VFx in visible vertebrae. The sensitivity increased after excluding of mild deformities. Thus, this methodology is easy and feasible to be performed during routine DXA measurements, in order to improve the management of patients with higher risk of osteoporotic fractures.",Excluded
3342,"Masking responses to light in period mutant mice Masking is an acute effect of an external signal on an overt rhythm and is distinct from the process of entrainment. In the current study, we investigated the phase dependence and molecular mechanisms regulating masking effects of light pulses on spontaneous locomotor activity in mice. The circadian genes, Period1 (Per1) and Per2, are necessary components of the timekeeping machinery and entrainment by light appears to involve the induction of the expression of Per1 and Per2 mRNAs in the suprachiasmatic nuclei (SCN). We assessed the roles of the Per genes in regulating masking by assessing the effects of light pulses on nocturnal locomotor activity in C57BL/6J Per mutant mice. We found that Per1-/- and Per2-/- mice had robust negative masking responses to light. In addition, the locomotor activity of Per1 -/-/Per2-/- mice appeared to be rhythmic in the light-dark (LD) cycle, and the phase of activity onset was advanced (but varied among individual mice) relative to lights off. This rhythm persisted for 1 to 2 days in constant darkness in some Per1-/-/Per2-/- mice. Furthermore, Per1-/-/Per2-/- mice exhibited robust negative masking responses to light. Negative masking was phase dependent in wild-type mice such that maximal suppression was induced by light pulses at zeitgeber time 14 (ZT14) and gradually weaker suppression occurred during light pulses at ZT16 and ZT18. By measuring the phase shifts induced by the masking protocol (light pulses were administered to mice maintained in the LD cycle), we found that the phase responsiveness of Per mutant mice was altered compared to wild-types. Together, our data suggest that negative masking responses to light are robust in Per mutant mice and that the Per1-/-/Per2-/- SCN may be a light-driven, weak/damping oscillator.

3627,"Synaptic plasticity in the adult spinal dorsal horn: the appearance of new functional connections following peripheral nerve regeneration Peripherally regenerated fibers were impaled in the dorsal columns. Each impaled fiber's adequate stimulus was determined and the fiber was activated by passing brief (200 ms) current pulses through the microelectrode. Cord dorsum potentials (CDPs) elicited by fiber stimulation were recorded at 8 sites, and then the fiber was injected with Neurobiotin (NB). In the same preparations, dorsal horn cells were impaled and their receptive fields (RFs) mapped; areas of skin from which the most vigorous responses were elicited were noted. Needle electrodes inserted into these cutaneous ""hot spots"" were used to electrically activate minimal numbers of peripherally regenerated fibers while simultaneously recording the resulting CDPs and any intracellular EPSPs. This allowed determination of connectivity between regenerated fibers and dorsal horn cells with overlapping RFs. In agreement with findings in intact animals, NB revealed long-ranging collaterals which were not seen using intraaxonally injected horseradish peroxidase (HRP). Although there was no qualitative difference in their morphology compared to those seen in controls, the correlation between spatial distribution of boutons and amplitudes of the monosynaptic CDPs of peripherally regenerated fibers revealed significant shifts in the functional efficacy of many central connections. Transcutaneous electrical stimulation revealed a significantly higher incidence of connectivity between regenerated fibers and cells with overlapping RFs at 9-12 months (86%) than at 5-6 months (34%). Although there was no obvious anatomical reorganization of afferent projections in the dorsal horn, the observed functional changes with time following transection show the formation of new functional central connections.",Excluded

Wide-field external beam radiation therapy, which we define as irradiation of cranial or caudal halves of the body either individually or sequentially, was undertaken as an experimental option to treat cats with either chemotherapy-refractory or naive hematopoietic neoplasia considered to have a poor prognosis. Fifteen cats with hematopoietic malignancies received wide-field external beam radiation therapy between 2003 and 2006. Cats received 8Gy delivered in 4Gy fractions with 60Co photons. Treatment-related toxicity was scored according to criteria established by the Veterinary Cooperative Oncology Group. Animals without preexisting abnormalities on hemograms exhibited no or mild (Grade 1 or 2) hematopoietic toxicity. Although most cats (14 of 15) had preexisting gastrointestinal (GI) signs, these signs were stable (29%) or improved (42%) following irradiation. Worsening GI signs following irradiation occurred transiently in two cats and in association with progressive disease in two others. No pulmonary, renal, hepatic, or dermatologic toxicities were detected.

237,"Disaster preparedness education and a Midwest Regional Poison Center OBJECTIVE: To assess knowledge and comfort related to disaster preparedness and response gained and retained from a disaster medicine workshop given to Certified Specialists in Poison Information (CSPI). DESIGN: A pilot study with a pre-post intervention design. SETTING: A Midwest Regional Poison Center. PARTICIPANTS: All CSPIs employed at the participating Poison Center (N = 27) were recruited. Participation ranged from 44 percent (n = 12) for the 4-month postworkshop knowledge quiz to 78 percent (n = 21) for the preworkshop survey. INTERVENTION: A disaster medicine workshop was given to the CSPIs. Quizzes and surveys were done preworkshop and then repeated at 1 week, 4 months, and 14 months postworkshop. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: CSPI knowledge and comfort pertaining to disaster-related calls. RESULT(S): CSPIs' comfort levels with calls regarding major chemical or nuclear/radiation disasters significantly increased and stayed elevated during all follow-up periods [Kruskal-Wallis chi2 (3) = 13.1, p = 0.01]. The average preworkshop quiz score was 58.2 percent.

2742,"Preoperative isolated limb infusion of doxorubicin and external irradiation for limb-threatening soft tissue sarcomas Background: At present, limb-sparing surgery is the most appropriate and acceptable treatment option for soft tissue sarcomas of the extremities. To increase the number of limb-sparing resections in the treatment of locally advanced soft tissue sarcomas of the extremities, preoperative radiotherapy and/or chemotherapy are often used. Isolated limb perfusion of cytostatic agents is an effective alternative option but technically complex. Isolated limb infusion, essentially a low-flow isolated limb perfusion without oxygenation via a percutaneous catheter, had been developed as a simple alternative. Objective(s): The objective of this study was to achieve limb-sparing surgery in patients with locally advanced soft tissue sarcomas of the extremities that would otherwise have required an amputation or a functionally mutilating surgery by performing preoperative isolated limb infusion with doxorubicin and external beam irradiation to obtain local control and make limb-sparing surgery feasible. Method(s): A total of 40 patients with locally advanced soft tissue sarcomas of the extremities were evaluated between 2002 and 2005. Tumors were located in the lower limb in 28 patients (70%) and in the upper limb in 12 patients (30%). All of these patients were felt to be unresectable and were referred because amputation was considered the only available treatment option. They underwent preoperative isolated limb infusion with doxorubicin (0.7 and 1.4 mg/kg for the upper and lower limbs, respectively). Preoperative external beam radiotherapy started within 3-7 days after isolated limb infusion was administered. The total dose was 35 Gy in ten fractions. After 3-7 weeks, surgery was performed aiming at limb preservation. Result(s): Tumor response was seen in 85% of patients, rendering these large sarcomas resectable in most cases. The mean values of pretreatment tumor volume and post-treatment volume were 2797 cm3 and 1781 cm3, respectively, with a significant p value of 0.0001. Histologic response was seen in 80% of patients. At a median followup of 15 months (range = 5-35), limb salvage was achieved in 82.5%. Procedure-related complications were limited and easily managed. Conclusion(s): Isolated limb infusion with doxorubicin is a simple and safe method of regional chemotherapy.

Patients and Methods: Sixty-four patients with locally advanced squamous cancers (stage IV, 98%; N2/3, 81%) were treated on an intensive regimen consisting of 5-day (120-hour) infusions of paclitaxel (20 mg/m2/d) and fluorouracil (600 mg/m2/d), oral hydroxyurea 500 mg every 12 hours for 11 doses, and radiation 1.5 Gy bid (T-FH2X). Chemoradiation was administered concomitantly on days 1 to 5 of each 14-day cycle. A full treatment course consisted of five cycles during a 10-week period to a total radiation dose of 72 to 75 Gy. Result(s): The median follow-up for the group is 34 months. At 3 years, progression-free survival is 63%, locoregional control is 86%, and systemic control is 79%; overall survival is 60%. Seventeen patients died of recurrent cancer, two died of second primary cancers, and four died of other causes. Side effects observed include anemia (22% required transfusion), leucopenia (34%, grade 3 to 4), and mucositis (84%, grade 3 to 4). Organ preservation principles were maintained. At 1 year posttreatment, 61% of patients had severe xerostomia and 47% had compromised swallowing. There was little disturbance of speech quality in 97% of patients at the same follow-up point. Conclusion(s): T-FH2X is a highly active and tolerable concomitant chemotherapy and hyperfractionated radiation regimen that induces sustained local tumor control and holds promise for improved survival with organ preservation in high-risk patients. Identification of less toxic therapy and improved distant disease control are needed.

2181,"Weight-adapted iodinated contrast media administration in abdomino-pelvic CT: Can image quality be maintained? Introduction In many centres, a fixed method of contrast-media administration is used for CT regardless of patient body habitus. The aim of this trial was to assess contrast enhancement of the aorta, portal vein, liver and spleen during abdomino-pelvic CT imaging using a weight-adapted contrast media protocol compared to the current fixed dose method. Methods Thirty-nine oncology patients, who had previously undergone CT abdomino-pelvic imaging at the institution using a fixed contrast media dose, were prospectively imaged using a weight-adapted contrast media dose (1.4 ml/kg). The two sets of images were assessed for contrast enhancement levels (HU) at locations in the liver, aorta, portal vein and spleen during portal-venous enhancement phase. The t-test was used to compare the difference in results using a non-inferiority margin of 10 HU. Results When the contrast dose was tailored to patient weight, contrast enhancement levels were shown to be non-inferior to the fixed dose method (liver p < 0.001; portal vein p = 0.003; aorta p = 0.001; spleen p = 0.001). As a group, patients received a total contrast dose reduction of 165 ml using the weight-adapted method compared to the fixed dose method, with a mean cost per patient of 6.81 and 7.19 respectively. Conclusion Using a weight-adapted method of contrast media administration was shown to be non-inferior to a fixed dose method of contrast media administration. Patients weighing 76 kg, or less, received a lower contrast dose which may have associated cost savings. A weight-adapted contrast media protocol should be implemented for portal-venous phase abdomino-pelvic CT for oncology patients with adequate renal function (>70 ml/min/1.73 m2).Copyright © 2017",Excluded
204,"Treatment efficiency of combining photodynamic therapy and ionizing radiation for Bowen's disease BACKGROUND: Topical 5-aminolevulinic acid photodynamic therapy (ALA-PDT) is widely used for treating Bowen's disease (BD), but recurrence and tumour cell persistence after ALA-PDT is sometimes problematic. Radiation therapy (RT) is also effective for BD, but is limited by its side-effects, such as refractory ulcers., OBJECTIVE: The objective of the study was to observe a synergic effect of combination therapy with ALA-PDT and RT for BD cases that did not respond effectively to prior ALA-PDT., METHODS: Subjects were BD patients whose lesion did not show complete remission or showed recurrence after prior ALA-PDT. A total of four cases involving four lesions were studied (three male and one female, mean age 69.5). ALA ointment (20%) was applied to the lesions. After 4 to 6h, subjects received combination therapy consisting of excimer-pumped dye laser radiation at 630nm (50J/cm(2) ) followed by electron-beam radiation (3Gy). The combination therapy was repeated every 2 to 3days for a total of four treatments. The lesions were evaluated clinically or histologically after the final combination therapy session., RESULTS: Following combination therapy, all of the lesions disappeared. Recurrence was not detected during the observations periods, which averaged 14.0months in duration., CONCLUSION: Our results indicate that the cure rate of BD could be improved by combination therapy with ALA-PDT and RT. Compared with conventional RT, the synergetic effect of this therapy might reduce the dose of radiation required, thereby also reducing skin side-effects such as refractory ulcers.

399,"Neuromuscular activation patterns during treadmill walking after space flight Astronauts adopt a variety of neuromuscular control strategies during space flight that are appropriate for locomoting in that unique environment, but are less than optimal upon return to Earth. We report here the first systematic investigation of potential adaptations in neuromuscular activity patterns associated with postflight locomotion. Astronaut-subjects were tasked with walking on a treadmill at 6.4 km/h while fixating a visual target 30 cm away from their eyes after space flights of 8-15 days. Surface electromyography was collected from selected lower limb muscles and normalized with regard to mean amplitude and temporal relation to heel strike. In general, high correlations (more than 0.80) were found between preflight and postflight activation waveforms for each muscle and each subject: however relative activation amplitude around heel strike and toe off was changed as a result of flight. The level of muscle cocontraction and activation variability, and the relationship between the phasic characteristics of the ankle musculature in preparation for toe off also were altered by space flight. Subjects also reported oscillopsia during treadmill walking after flight. These findings indicate that, after space flight, the sensory-motor system can generate neuromuscular-activation strategies that permit treadmill walking, but subtle changes in lower-limb neuromuscular activation are present that may contribute to increased lower limb kinematic variability and oscillopsia also present during postflight walking.",Excluded
1305,"The effect of head-to-trunk position on the direction of arm movements before, during, and after space flight This contribution deals with the examination of the consequences of different head-to-trunk positions on arm movements under normal gravity and during prolonged space flight. One of the objectives of this study was to investigate the influence of weightlessness on the condition of the spatial analysis system. Aimed arm movements in the horizontal plane (pointings towards two visual targets) were recorded, first with eyes open, head straight (learning part), then with eyes closed, head straight and during yaw or roll position of the head (performance part). Measurements related to these different head-to-trunk-positions were taken in one short-term and nine long-term cosmonauts preflight, inflight, and postflight. Terrestrial control experiments were carried out with an extended experimental design in 14 healthy volunteers. The analysis of these experiments revealed that, with eyes closed and the head in yaw position, cosmonauts before flight and control subjects exhibit significant slants of the movement plane of the arm. Contrary to terrestrial measurements, in space experiments roll tilt of the head to the right is correlated with considerable counterclockwise slant of the movement plane. This slant of the movement plane of the arm was interpreted as tilt of the internal representation of the horizontal coordinate. The effect is larger with greater distortion induced by the changed head position and with larger muscular involvement to keep this position. This effect is also increased by the reduction of information (for example, in microgravity). The amount and the direction of the horizontal offset of the arm movements are shown to be dependent on the head-to-trunk position, too. Additionally, we have found changes in the amplitude and in the duration of the arm movement, in the vertical offset, and in the curvature of the movement paths, depending on the experimental conditions.",Excluded
3291,"Analysis of the seasonal pattern in suicide BACKGROUND: Suicide has been attributed to social and psychological factors but also to geophysical effects. Of the latter, changes in solar radiation and geomagnetic activities may contribute to the frequency and the seasonal pattern of suicides., METHODS: We studied with a population-based, nationwide analysis all the individuals who committed suicide (n=27,469) in Finland during the period of 1979 to 1999. The daily data on the number of suicides, and the mean and maximum levels of geomagnetic activity were compiled and modelled with Poisson regression using the number of inhabitants in each province as the denominator. Time series analysis of monthly numbers of suicides was carried out using a seasonal-trend decomposition procedure., RESULTS: There was a strong seasonal effect on suicide occurrence (P<0.00001), the risk of suicide being greatest in spring. The seasonal effect was most pronounced when the number of suicides was relatively low. High levels of solar radiation activity were associated with the increased risk of suicide (P=0.00001), but the effect of geomagnetic activity was weak., LIMITATIONS: No individual data on alcohol consumption or mental disorders were available., CONCLUSIONS: Suicide occurrence varies markedly by season and needs attention where prevention is concerned.",Excluded

3642,"Effect of age, different light conditions, melatonin, and epitalon on lysosomal proteinase activity in the liver and kidneys of rats Ageing, melatonin, epithalon (tetrapeptide Ala-Glu-Asp-Gly) and different light conditions effects on protein content and cathepsins B and D activities in rat liver and kidneys lysosomal fractions were studied. Ageing leads to decrease of cathepsins activity in rat liver lysosomal fractions. Constant light and darkness conditions result in earlier age decline of cathepsins activity. Absence of day and night succession in comparison with alternating light conditions causes decline of both general and specific cathepsin D activity. Melatonin and epithalon administration resulted in decrease of cathepsin D activity in liver only under control interchangeable light conditions. Cathepsin B activity in liver and kidneys lysosomal fractions declined in all experimental light conditions. Cathepsins activity decrease under the influence of epiphysial factors is evidently connected with their inhibitory effect on protein and general metabolism.",Excluded
1824,"Re-irradiation plus bevacizumab treatment in patients with recurrent high-grade gliomas BACKGROUND: Bevacizumab (BEV) is increasingly utilized in the treatment of recurrent high-grade gliomas. However, the utility of BEV in the setting of re-irradiation has not been fully evaluated. We examined the timing of BEV treatment in relation to re-irradiation for recurrent high-grade gliomas. METHOD(S): We retrospectively reviewed the medical records of patients with recurrent high-grade gliomas, treated between2007 and 2012, with a second course of radiation therapy. We compared overall survival (OS) and progression free survival (PFS) as calculated from the time recurrent highgrade glioma was diagnosed. RESULT(S): A total of 50 patients were identified with a median follow-up of 10 months (range 2.2 to 70). 12 patients received no BEV, 18 received concurrent BEV with re-irradiation, 16 BEV after re-irradiation, and 4 before re-irradiation. Median PFS was 14.4, 3.6, 5.8, and 3.5 months and median OS 25.2, 6.3, 9.9, and 5.7 months, respectively. There were no significant differences in age, sex, or number of surgical resections between groups. However, patients not receiving BEV were more likely to have received either concurrent or adjuvant temozolomide with re-irradiation (p = 0.002, Fisher's Exact Test) or to have been first diagnosed with low-grade tumors. No patients that received BEV prior to re-irradiation experienced overt radiation necrosis, whereas other groups experienced a 30-33% incidence of necrosis. CONCLUSION(S): In this small retrospective study, patients receiving no BEV had superior survival. However, selection bias, temozolomide use and histologymayaccount for this finding. Amongpatients receiving BEV, BEV administered following re-irradiation yielded the best PFS and OS. However, BEV with re-irradiation did not appear to improve PFS or OS compared with historical data with single agent BEV or re-irradiation alone.BEVdid not appear to lower incidence of radiation necrosis, except when given prior re-irradiation.",Excluded
2790,"The effects of exposure to microgravity and reconditioning of the lumbar multifidus and anterolateral abdominal muscles: implications for people with LBP BACKGROUND CONTEXT: One of the primary changes in the neuromuscular system in response to microgravity is skeletal muscle atrophy, which occurs especially in muscles that maintain posture while being upright on Earth. Reduced size of paraspinal and abdominal muscles has been documented after spaceflight. Exercises are undertaken on the International Space Station (ISS) during and following space flight to remediate these effects. Understanding the adaptations which occur in trunk muscles in response to microgravity could inform the development of specific countermeasures, which may have applications for people with conditions on Earth such as low back pain (LBP). PURPOSE: The aim of this study was to examine the changes in muscle size and function of the lumbar multifidus (MF) and anterolateral abdominal muscles (1) in response to exposure to 6 months of microgravity on the ISS and (2) in response to a 15-day reconditioning program on Earth. DESIGN: Prospective longitudinal series. PATIENT SAMPLE: Data were collected from five astronauts who undertook seven long-duration missions on the ISS. OUTCOME MEASURES: For the MF muscle, measures included cross-sectional area (CSA) and linear measures to assess voluntary isometric contractions at vertebral levels L2 to L5. For the abdominal muscles, the thickness of the transversus abdominis (TrA), obliquus internus abdominis (IO) and obliquus externus abdominis (EO) muscles at rest and on contraction were measured. METHOD(S): Ultrasound imaging of trunk muscles was conducted at four timepoints (preflight, postflight, mid-reconditioning, and post reconditioning). Data were analyzed using multilevel linear models to estimate the change in muscle parameters of interest across three time periods. RESULT(S): Beta-coefficients (estimates of the expected change in the measure across the specified time period, adjusted for the baseline measurement) indicated that the CSA of the MF muscles decreased significantly at all lumbar vertebral levels (except L2) in response to exposure to microgravity (L3=12.6%; L4=6.1%, L5=10.3%; p<.001), and CSAs at L3-L5 vertebral levels increased in the reconditioning period (p<.001). The thickness of the TrA decreased by 34.1% (p<.017), IO decreased by 15.4% (p=.04), and the combination of anterolateral abdominal muscles decreased by 16.2% (p<.001) between pre- and postflight assessment and increased (TrA<0.008; combined p=.035) during the postreconditioning period. Results showed decreased contraction of the MF muscles at the L2 (from 12.8% to 3.4%; p=.007) and L3 (from 12.2% to 5%; p=.032) vertebral levels following exposure to microgravity which increased (L2, p=.046) after the postreconditioning period. Comparison with preflight measures indicated that there were no residual changes in muscle size and function after the postreconditioning period, apart from CSA of MF at L2, which remained 15.3% larger than preflight values (p<.001). CONCLUSION(S): In-flight exercise countermeasures mitigated, but did not completely prevent, changes in the size and function of the lumbar MF and anterolateral abdominal muscles. Many of the observed changes in size and control of the MF and abdominal muscles that occurred in response to prolonged exposure to microgravity paralleled those seen in people with LBP or exposed to prolonged bed rest on Earth. Daily individualized postflight reconditioning, which included both motor control training and weight-bearing exercises with an emphasis on retraining strength and endurance to re-establish normal postural alignment with respect to gravity, restored the decreased size and control of the MF (at the L3-L5 vertebral levels) and anterolateral abdominal muscles. Drawing parallels between changes which occur to the neuromuscular system in microgravity and which exercises best recover muscle size and function could help health professionals tailor improved interventions for terrestrial populations. Results suggested that the principles underpinning the exercises developed for astronauts following prolonged exposure to microg avity (emphasizing strength and endurance training to re-establish normal postural alignment and distribution of load with respect to gravity) can also be applied for people with chronic LBP, as the MF and anterolateral abdominal muscles were affected in similar ways in both populations. The results may also inform the development of new astronaut countermeasures targeting the MF and abdominal muscles.Copyright © 2020 Elsevier Inc.",Excluded
54,"Effects on human skin of repetitive ultraviolet-A1 (UVA1) irradiation and visible light Background: Ultraviolet radiation (UVR) has a variety of effects on human skin. Best known are the effects of UVB (290-320 nm) and UVA2 (320-340 nm), which cause DNA damage and increased risk of cancer. However, the effects of UVA1 (340-400 nm) have been not completely investigated. Method(s): The effects of repetitive low doses of UVA1 and visible light were studied in 12 healthy individuals. A part of the buttock was exposed to 20 J/cm2 UVA1 and another part to 126 J/cm2 of visible light three times a week for 4 weeks. Repeated punch biopsies were taken during the 4 weeks of treatment and also 2 weeks after the last irradiation. The avidin-biotin-immunoperoxidase technique was used to investigate the expression of p53, p21WAF, bcl-2, Ki67 and cyclin A. Result(s): By comparison to untreated skin, an increased expression of p53 but not p21WAF in keratinocytes was seen. The bcl-2 protein expression increased slightly after both UVA1 and visible light. An increased staining with Ki67 and cyclin A after UVA1 but not after visible light was observed as a sign of increased proliferation. Conclusion(s): These results suggest that suberythemal doses of UVA1 and even visible light may cause DNA damage.",Excluded
1672,"Intravascular radiation accelerates atherosclerotic lesion formation of hypercholesteremic rabbits OBJECTIVES: The purpose of the present study is to evaluate the effect of intravascular radiation (IR) on the arterial wall of uninjured vessels in the hypercholesteremic rabbit model., METHODS: Aortas of 24 New Zealand white rabbits were treated with either intravascular 192-Ir gamma-radiation (15 Gy at 2 mm from the center of the source) or were exposed to the source catheter without radiation (sham controls). Following the radiation treatment, the animals were fed a 2% cholesterol diet until euthanasia at 2 (n=8) or 6 (n=16) weeks. Arteries were analyzed using light and scanning electron microscopy (SEM); transforming growth factor beta (TGF-beta) 1, a promoter of connective tissue deposition, was also monitored., RESULTS: At 2 weeks, SEM analysis showed well-aligned endothelial cells in nonradiated segments, whereas irradiated arteries consistently contained adherent and subendothelial macrophages with focal areas of endothelial disruption. Further radiated segments at 2 weeks showed a 7-fold increase in active TGF beta-1 over nonradiated segments. At 6 weeks, there was a significant increase in plaque and vessel wall area relative to control arteries, however, no differences were noted in the density of actin-positive smooth muscle cells (SMCs) or macrophages. Similarly, no differences were noted in cell proliferation between groups as evidenced by the marker bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU). In contrast, nonirradiated segments frequently contained cellular areas with extracellular lipid., CONCLUSION: Exposure of previously uninjured vessels to IR and hypercholesterolemia is associated with increased plaque burden and leads to more advanced plaque types. Special care should be taken to minimize radiation exposure in normal vascular segments in hypercholesterolemic patients undergoing radiation therapy.",Included

All 35 patients received fixed activities of 7.8 GBq 177Lu-octreotate each 8 weeks, with 14 days of capecitabine 1500 mg/m2 for 4 cycles. In phase I, successive cohorts of patients received escalating doses of temozolomide in groupings of 100, 150, and 200 mg/m2 in the last 5 days of each capecitabine cycle. In phase II, patients were treated with 200 mg/m2 temozolomide. Treatment was well tolerated in all dosage groups. No dose-limiting grade 2, 3, or 4 toxicities were seen in cohorts 1 (100 mg/m2) or 2 (150 mg/m2). Twenty-eight patients completed treatment at the 200 mg/m2 temozolomide level. Adverse events were mild to moderate. The commonest toxicities were transient nausea grade 2 (18%), grade 3 (3%), thrombocytopenia grade 2 (24%), and neutropenia grade 3 (6%). There were no grade 4 events. Thirty-four patients were evaluable for tumor response. Overall, complete response (CR) was achieved in 15% (95% CI 3-27); partial response (PR), in 38% (95% CI 22-55); stable disease (SD), in 38% (95% CI 22-55); and 3 patients failed to respond to treatment. Median progression free survival (PFS) was 31 months (95% CI 21-33), and median overall survival (OS) has not been reached with 90% surviving at 24 months follow-up (range 21-30). Overall objective response rate (ORR) in patients with gastroenteropancreatic NETs showed CR 16% (95% CI 3-28), PR 41% (95% CI 24-58), SD 37% (95% CI 21-54), and PD 6% (95% CI 0-15). Response rates were higher in patients with gastropancreatic NETs than in those with bowel primaries (enteric-NETs); CR 18% versus 13%, PR 64% versus 13%, SD 12% versus 67%. 177Lu-octreotate, in combination with capecitabine and temozolomide, is well tolerated in patients with advanced low-grade NETs, and shows substantial tumor control rates. © Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.",Excluded

In 34 patients with advanced hypopharyngeal, nasopharyngeal, or oropharyngeal cancer, changes in speech from pretreatment to 10 weeks and 1 year posttreatment were correlated with mean doses to the base of tongue (BOT), oral cavity (OC) and tonsillar fossa/soft palate (VP). Differences in anteroposterior tongue position, dorsoventral degree of tongue to palate or pharynx constriction, grooving, strength, nasality, and laryngeal rise, were assessed by acoustic changes in three speech sounds that depend on a (post-) alveolar closure or narrowing (/t/, /s/, /z/), three with a tongue to palate/pharyngeal narrowing (/l/, /r/, /u/), and in vowel /a/ at comfortable and highest pitch. Acoustically assessed changes in tongue positioning, shape, velopharyngeal constriction, and laryngeal elevation were significantly related to mean doses to the tongue and velopharynx. The mean dose to BOT predicted changes in anteroposterior tongue positioning from pre- to 10-weeks posttreatment. From pretreatment to 1-year, mean doses to BOT, OC, and VP were related to changes in grooving, strength, laryngeal height, nasality, palatalization, and degree of pharyngeal constriction. Changes in speech are related to mean doses to the base of tongue and velopharynx. The outcome indicates that strength, motility, and the balance between agonist and antagonist muscle forces change significantly after radiotherapy.",Excluded
3420,"Cardiac magnetic resonance and the need for routine cardiac catheterization in single ventricle patients prior to Fontan: A comparison of 3 groups: Pre-Fontan CMR versus cath evaluation Objectives: This study investigated whether cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) and echocardiography (echo) can replace catheterization (cath) for routine evaluation prior to Fontan and under what circumstances CMR and cath are used together. Background(s): Routine cath prior to Fontan has been utilized for years; noninvasive methods, however, may be sufficient. Method(s): This study reviews clinical data in 119 consecutive patients investigating 3 groups: those who underwent CMR alone (MR; n = 41), cath alone (C; n = 41), or both cath and CMR (C+M; n = 37) prior to Fontan. Result(s): No clinically significant differences were noted in patient characteristics, hemodynamics, or clinical status prior to or after surgery between the C and MR groups. CMR added information in 82%. There were no discrepant findings between CMR and cath data in the C+M group. Diagnostic success was <95% in all groups. Of those undergoing Fontan completion, the C+M group had similar outcomes to C and MR; C and CMR were utilized in combination to assess aortopulmonary collaterals or the need for an intervention or evaluate its success. Echo could not delineate pulmonary arterial anatomy in 46% to 53% of patients. The C+M and C groups were exposed to 6.8 +/- 4.1 mSv of radiation. Conclusion(s): Single ventricle patients not requiring an intervention can undergo successful Fontan completion with CMR and echo alone with similar short-term outcomes to C, which was used as a control, preventing an invasive test and exposure to radiation. CMR can add information in a significant number of patients. Cath and CMR are utilized together for interventions and assessment of aortopulmonary collaterals. © 2012 American College of Cardiology Foundation.",Excluded
1809,"Accuracy of vertebral fracture assessment by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry using GE iDXA compared to conventional radiography Objectives: This prospective investigation was carried out in order to evaluate the accuracy of vertebral fracture assessment by DXA using GE iDXA device (GE Medical Systems Lunar, Madison, WI, USA) compared to conventional radiography. Materials/Methods: We enrolled 273 subjects (207 females and 68 males, age range 28-85 years) consecutively studied at our Mineral Metabolism Centre, which were undergoing a spine vertebral X-ray evaluation. Lateral images of the spine, from T4 to L4, by both conventional X-ray and iDXA device, were acquired in each subject on the same day, after informed consent was obtained. The radiographs were evaluated by an experienced skeletal radiologist (D.D.), using the semiquantitative (SQ) method. The iDXA images were evaluated by a trained operator using a specific software (enCORE). Result(s): By means of SQ radiological technique, we evaluated 3,515 (99%) of the 3,549 available vertebrae, and identified 151 vertebral deformities (101mild and 50moderate or severe). By means of iDXA we visualized 3,405 (96%) vertebrae and identified 150 vertebral deformities (100 mild and 50 moderate or severe). Ninety-two subjects (33.7% of the total sample) were identified as having vertebral fractures by SQ Rx technique and eighty-seven subjects (31.9%) fractured were recognized by iDXA (chi2 = n.s.). A single fracture was detected in 66 patients (24.2%) by conventional radiographs and in 59 subjects (21.6%) by iDXA; 26 subjects (9.5%) had multiple vertebral fractures detected by SQ Rx technique and 28 subjects (10.2%) by iDXA . Considering radiological SQ assessment as the gold standard, iDXA sensitivity was 87% and the specificity was 96% (Positive Predictive Value 88%; Negative Predictive Value 97%). Agreement between radio-graphs and iDXA was 96% with a kappa statistic of 0.91 (confidence interval 0.82-0.96). Conclusion(s): According to the results obtained, iDXA and SQ radiological technique demonstrated good agreement in classifying vertebrae as normal or deformed. Therefore, since iDXA performs spine images with good resolution and lower dose, it proves to be useful in the clinical evaluation of patients at risk of osteoporosis or for the selection of patients for osteoporosis-related clinical trials.",Excluded
2283,"Noise reduction technology reduces radiation dose in chronic total occlusions percutaneous coronary intervention: a propensity score-matched analysis Chronic total occlusions (CTO) percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) is associated with high radiation dose. Our study aim was to evaluate the impact of the implementation of a noise reduction technology (NRT) on patient radiation dose during CTO PCI. A total of 187 CTO PCIs performed between February 2016 and May 2017 were analyzed according to the angiographic systems utilized: Standard (n = 60) versus NRT (n = 127). Propensity score matching (PSM) was performed to control for differences in baseline characteristics. Primary endpoints were Cumulative Air Kerma at Interventional Reference Point (AK at IRP), which correlates with patient's tissue reactions; and Kerma Area Product (KAP), a surrogate measure of patient's risk of stochastic radiation effects. An Efficiency Index (defined as fluoroscopy time/AK at IRP) was calculated for each procedure. Image quality was evaluated using a 5-grade Likert-like scale. After PSM, n = 55 pairs were identified. Baseline and angiographic characteristics were well matched between groups. Compared to the Standard system, NRT was associated with lower AK at IRP [2.38 (1.80-3.66) vs. 3.24 (2.04-5.09) Gy, p = 0.035], a trend towards reduction for KAP [161 (93-244) vs. 203 (136-363) Gycm2, p = 0.069], and a better Efficiency Index [16.75 (12.73-26.27) vs. 13.58 (9.92-17.63) min/Gy, p = 0.003]. Image quality was similar between the two groups (4.39 +/- 0.53 Standard vs. 4.34 +/- 0.47 NRT, p = 0.571). In conclusion, compared with a Standard system, the use of NRT in CTO PCI is associated with lower patient radiation dose and similar image quality.",Excluded
990,"Decrease of respiratory burst in neutrophils of patients with ankylosing spondylitis by combined radon-hyperthermia treatment OBJECTIVE: To define the respiratory burst activity of neutrophils, the total anti-oxidative status of plasma, and the parameters of systemic inflammation in patients with ankylosing spondylitis (AS) before and after a combined radon-hyperthermia treatment in the thermal tunnels of Bockstein-Bad Gastein in Austria., METHODS: In 20 patients with AS the effects of a total of 15 hours of radon-hyperthermia-treatment spread over a period of three weeks were studied. The respiratory burst activity of neutrophils was measured fluorometrically using dichlorofluorescein diacetate, the total anti-oxidant status was measured using azinodiethyl-benzthiazoline-sulphonate, and inflammation parameters were determined by routine laboratory assays., RESULTS: Before treatment, the basal neutrophil respiratory burst in patients (n = 20) was 409 +/- 62 fluorescence arbitrary units (AU; mean +/- SEM) and 359 +/- 37 AU in controls (n = 9; p > 0.5); the stimulated respiratory burst (fMet-Leu-Phe, 10(-6) M) was 1,027 +/- 133 AU in patients and 1,152 +/- 218 AU in controls (p > 0.5). After treatment, the basal neutrophil respiratory burst in patients (n = 19) was 137 +/- 16 and in controls it was 174 +/- 35 AU (n = 8; p > 0.1); the stimulated respiratory burst was 670 +/- 66 and 1,305 +/- 82 AU, in patients and controls respectively (p < 0.001). No effects of treatment on the total anti-oxidant status of the plasma or on the parameters of inflammation were detected., CONCLUSION: Combined radon-hyperthermia treatment reduces the respiratory burst activity of the blood circulating neutrophils in patients with AS. If respiratory burst activity from the neutrophils plays a role in the pathophysiology of ankylosing spondylitis, the observed reduction may be related to the beneficial effects of radon-hyperthermia treatment.",Included
868,"Toxicity Related to Radiotherapy Dose and Targeting Strategy: A Pooled Analysis of Cooperative Group Trials of Combined Modality Therapy for Locally Advanced Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer OBJECTIVE: Concurrent chemoradiotherapy (CRT) was the standard treatment for locally advanced NSCLC (LA-NSCLC). This study was performed to examine thoracic radiotherapy (TRT) parameters and their impact on adverse events (AEs)., METHODS: We collected individual patient data from 3600 patients with LA-NSCLC who participated in 16 cooperative group trials of concurrent CRT. The TRT parameters examined included field design strategy (elective nodal irradiation [ENI] versus involved-field [IF] TRT [IF-TRT]) and TRT dose (60 Gy versus >=60 Gy). The primary end point of this analysis was the occurrence of AEs. ORs for AEs were calculated with univariable and multivariable logistic models., RESULTS: TRT doses ranged from 60 to 74 Gy. ENI was not associated with more grade 3 or higher AEs than IF-TRT was (multivariable OR = 0.77, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.543-1.102, p = 0.1545). Doses higher than 60 Gy (high-dose TRT) were associated with significantly more grade 3 or higher AEs (multivariable OR = 1.82, 95% CI: 1.501-2.203, p < 0.0001). In contrast, ENI was associated with significantly more grade 4 or higher AEs (multivariable OR = 1.33, 95% CI: 1.035-1.709, p = 0.0258). Doses higher than 60 Gy were also associated with more grade 4 or higher AEs (multivariate OR = 1.42, 95% CI: 1.191-1.700, p = 0.0001). Grade 5 AEs plus treatment-related deaths were more frequent with higher-dose TRT (p = 0.0012) but not ENI (p = 0.099)., CONCLUSIONS: For patients with LA-NSCLC treated with concurrent CRT, IF-TRT was not associated with the overall risk of grade 3 or higher AEs but was associated with significantly fewer grade 4 or higher AEs than ENI TRT. This is likely the result of irradiation of a lesser amount of adjacent critical normal tissue. Higher TRT doses were associated significantly with grade 3 or higher and grade 4 or higher AEs. On the basis of these findings and our prior report on survival, CRT using IF-TRT and 60 Gy (conventionally fractionated) were associated with more favorable patient survival and less toxicity than was the use of ENI or higher radiotherapy doses.

Fifty-nine animals were given the opportunity to participate in cognitive cage-side testing. The animals that received single-dose gamma irradiation were significantly less likely to engage in cognitive testing than the controls, suggesting that irradiated animals may have differences in cognitive ability. Five irradiated (6.75-8.05 Gy) and three naive control animals self-selected, were extensively trained and administered a simple visual discrimination with reversal (SVD+R) task 2-3 times per week for 11-18 months. Each session consisted of 30 trials in which the animals were required to choose the correct visual stimulus for a food reward. After the initial presentation, the stimulus that signaled the presence of food was twice reversed once the animal reached criterion (90% accuracy across four consecutive sessions). While the limited sample size precluded definitive statistical analysis, irradiated animals took longer to reach the criterion subsequent to reversal than did control animals, suggesting a relative deficiency in cognitive flexibility. These results provide preliminary data supporting the potential use of a nonhuman primate model to study radiation-induced, late-delayed cognitive deficits.",Included

Confidence in medical evaluations with increasing levels of laboratory testing and imaging was rated on a 100-point visual analog scale. Knowledge of radiation exposure was ascertained when participants compared the radiation dose of one abdomen-pelvis CT with 2-view chest radiography. To assess cancer risk knowledge, participants rated their agreement with these factual statements: Approximately 2 to 3 abdominal CTs give the same radiation exposure as experienced by Hiroshima survivors"" and ""2 to 3 abdominal CTs over a person's lifetime can increase cancer risk."" Previous CT was also assessed., RESULTS: There were 1,168 participants, 67% women and mean age 40.7 years (SD 15.9 years). Median confidence in a medical evaluation without ancillary testing was 20 (95% confidence interval [CI] 16 to 25) compared with 90 (95% CI 88 to 91) when laboratory testing and CT were included. More than 70% of participants underestimated the radiation dose of CT relative to chest radiography, and cancer risk comprehension was poor. Median agreement with the Hiroshima statement was 13 (95% CI 10 to 16) and 45 (95% CI 40 to 45) with the increased lifetime cancer risk statement. Seven hundred ninety-five patients reported receiving a previous CT. Of 365 patients who reported no previous CT, 142 (39%) had one documented in our electronic medical record., CONCLUSION: Patients are more confident when CT imaging is part of their medical evaluation but have a poor understanding of the concomitant radiation exposure and risk and underestimate their previous imaging experience.

The treatment for piriformis syndrome using fluoroscopy, computed tomography (CT), electromyography (EMG), and ultrasound (US) has become standard practice. The treatment of Piriformis Syndrome has evolved to include fluoroscopy and EMG with CT guidance. We present a case study of 5 successful piriformis injections using 3-D computer-assisted electromagnet needle tracking coupled with ultrasound. A 6-degree of freedom electromagnetic position tracker was attached to the ultrasound probe that allowed the system to detect the position and orientation of the probe in the magnetic field. The tracked ultrasound probe was used to find the posterior superior iliac spine. Subsequently, 3 points were captured to register the ultrasound image with the CT or magnetic resonance image scan. Moreover, after the registration was obtained, the navigation system visualized the tracked needle relative to the CT scan in real-time using 2 orthogonal multi-planar reconstructions centered at the tracked needle tip. Conversely, a recent study revealed that fluoroscopically guided injections had 30% accuracy compared to ultrasound guided injections, which tripled the accuracy percentage. This novel technique exhibited an accurate needle guidance injection precision of 98% while advancing to the piriformis muscle and avoiding the sciatic nerve. The mean (+/- SD) procedure time was 19.08 (+/- 4.9) minutes. This technique allows for electromagnetic instrument tip tracking with real-time 3-D guidance to the selected target. As with any new technique, a learning curve is expected; however, this technique could offer an alternative, minimizing radiation exposure.",Excluded
2301,"Statistical modeling of carcinogenic risks in dogs that inhaled 238PuO2 Combined analyses of data on 260 life-span beagle dogs that inhaled 238PuO2 at the Inhalation Toxicology Research Institute (ITRI) and at Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL) were conducted. The hazard functions (age-specific risks) for incidence of lung, bone and liver tumors were modeled as a function of cumulative radiation dose, and estimates of lifetime risks based on the combined data were developed. For lung tumors, linear-quadratic functions provided an adequate fit to the data from both laboratories, and linear functions provided an adequate fit when analyses were restricted to doses less than 20 Gy. The estimated risk coefficients for these functions were significantly larger when based on ITRI data compared to PNNL data, and dosimetry biases are a possible explanation for this difference. There was also evidence that the bone tumor response functions differed for the two laboratories, although these differences occurred primarily at high doses. These functions were clearly nonlinear (even when restricted to average skeletal doses less than 1 Gy), and evidence of radiation-induced bone tumors was found for doses less than 0.5 Gy in both laboratories. Liver tumor risks were similar for the two laboratories, and linear functions provided an adequate fit to these data. Lifetime risk estimates for lung and bone tumors derived from these data had wide confidence intervals, but were consistent with estimates currently used in radiation protection. The dog-based lifetime liver tumor risk estimate was an order of magnitude larger than that used in radiation protection, but the latter also carries large uncertainties. The application of common statistical methodology to data from two studies has allowed the identification of differences in these studies and has provided a basis for common risk estimates based on both data sets.",Excluded

1941,"Epidemiology of lung cancer in women: A hospital-based descriptive study Objective: Lung cancer required much greater attention as it is the most common cause of death. According to statistics in 2010, 85% of lung cancer in men and 57% in women are attributed to tobacco smoking. The aim of the study was to describe the clinical and pathologic characteristics of the female patients who visited the Department of Medical Oncology of Acibadem Maslak Hospital between 2009 and 2017. Material(s) and Method(s): Clinicopathologic data collected for analyses included age at diagnosis, history of cigarette use, comorbid conditions, family history, tumor-node-metastasis stage, pathologic subtypes of lung carcinoma, and the given therapy. From July 2017 to February 2018, we collected data of 540 female patients with lung cancer at the Department of Medical Oncology of Acibadem Maslak Hospital. Result(s): Among 540 patients, 185 patients (34.3%) were nonsmokers, 106 (19.6%) were current smokers, and 210 (38.9%) were former smokers. Data on common comorbid conditions such as hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and coronary artery disease were collected, and the conditions were classified according to the smoking status of the patients. Among current and former smokers, 36.7% were diagnosed with hypertension, 18.3% with diabetes mellitus, and 11% with coronary artery diseases. Moreover, 75% of all patients were diagnosed with nonsmall-cell lung cancer (NSCLC), whereas 16% were diagnosed with small-cell lung cancer. Adenocarcinoma is the most common histological type of cancer seen in patients with NSCLC (77%), followed by patients with squamous cell carcinoma (15%). Conclusion(s): Factors other than tobacco use, such as radon exposure, air pollution, radiation exposure, and an unbalanced diet are responsible for the increasing incidence of lung cancer. However, further studies are warranted to investigate the cause of the epidemic differences in women, particularly the gender bias in nonsmoker patients with lung cancer.Copyright © 2020 by Turkish Society of Medical Oncology.",Excluded
744,"Insufficient Vitamin D Response to Solar Radiation in German Patients with Type 2 Diabetes or Gestational Diabetes Vitamin D deficiency is highly prevalent in all forms of diabetes mellitus. Recently, we reported how ultraviolet B (UVB) radiation affected vitamin D [25(OH)D3] concentrations in patients with type 1 diabetes. Our aim was to analyze whether patients with non-autoimmune diabetes, such as type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) also show the same vitamin D profile in relation to environmental factors including ambient temperature as an indirect parameter for outdoor activities. We analyzed 25(OH)D3 concentrations of T2DM (n=349) and GDM patients (n=327) at the University Hospital Frankfurt from 2005 to 2007. Additionally, daily UVB and monthly outside air temperature measurements for Frankfurt/Germany were obtained. We detected a positive correlation between UVB irradiation and 25(OH)D3 concentrations of T2DM and GDM patients (rho=0.50 and rho=0.63, p=0.003 and p<0.0001, respectively). UVB irradiation was in summer (April-October) higher than in winter (November-March) (5.6 kJ/m vs. 0.5 kJ/m, p<0.0001). However, the prevalence of vitamin D deficiency in summer remained high with 76% in T2DM and 59% in GDM. In a stepwise regression analysis for the 25(OH)D3 concentration, significant predictors were outdoor temperature (estimate=0.02, p<0.0001), UVB radiation (estimate=-0.0015, p=0.02), year (2006 vs. 2005 estimate=-0.06, p>0.05, 2007 vs. 2005: estimate=-0.13, p<0.0001) and diabetes type (estimate=0.06, p=0.03). In conclusion, the strong correlation between UVB radiation and 25(OH)D3 concentrations in T2DM and GDM patients determines the seasonal variation. Additional determinants for the 25(OH)D3 concentrations were outdoor temperature, year, and diabetes type. Despite the effects of solar radiation both patients groups remain largely vitamin D deficient during summers.Copyright © Georg Thieme Verlag KG Stuttgart, New York.",Excluded
2670,"Clinical results of proton-beam therapy for locoregionally advanced esophageal cancer PURPOSE: To evaluate the efficacy and safety of proton-beam therapy for locoregionally advanced esophageal cancer., PATIENTS AND METHODS: The subjects were 51 patients with esophageal cancer who were treated between 1985 and 2005 using proton beams with or without X-rays. All but one had squamous cell carcinoma. Of the 51 patients, 33 received combinations of X-rays (median 46 Gy) and protons (median 36 GyE) as a boost. The median total dose of combined X-rays and proton radiation for these 33 patients was 80 GyE (range 70-90 GyE). The other 18 patients received proton-beam therapy alone (median 79 GyE, range 62-98 GyE)., RESULTS: Treatment interruption due to radiation-induced esophagitis or hematologic toxicity was not required for any patient. The overall 5-year actuarial survival rate for the 51 patients was 21.1% and the median survival time was 20.5 months (95% confidence interval 10.9-30.2). Of the 51 patients, 40 (78%) showed a complete response within 4 months after completing treatment and seven (14%) showed a partial response, giving a response rate of 92% (47/51). The 5-year local control rate for all 51 patients was 38.0% and the median local control time was 25.5 months (95% confidence interval 14.6-36.3)., CONCLUSION: The results suggest that proton-beam therapy is an effective treatment for patients with locally advanced esophageal cancer. Further studies are required to determine the optimal total dose, fractionation schedules, and best combination of proton therapy with chemotherapy.",Excluded
384,"CyberKnife stereotactic radiosurgery for recurrent, metastatic, and residual hemangiopericytomas Objective. Hemangiopericytoma is a rare and aggressive meningeal tumor. Although surgical resection is the standard treatment, hemangiopericytomas often recur with high incidences of metastasis. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the role of CyberKnife stereotactic radiosurgery (CK) in the management of recurrent, metastatic, and residual hemangiopericytomas. Methods. In a review of the Stanford radiosurgery database between 2002 and 2009, the authors found 14 patients who underwent CK therapy for recurrent, metastatic, and residual hemangiopericytomas. A total of 24 tumors were treated and the median patient age was 52 years (range 29-70 years) at the time of initial CK therapy. The median follow-up period was 37 months (10-73 months) and all patients had been previously treated with surgical resection. Mean tumor volume was 9.16 cm3 and the mean marginal and maximum radiosurgical doses to the tumors were 21.2 Gy and 26.8 Gy, respectively. Result(s): Of the 24 tumors treated, 22 have clinical follow-up data at this time. Of those 22 tumors, 12 decreased in size (54.5%), 6 remained unchanged (27.3%), and 4 showed recurrence (18.2%) after CK therapy. Progression-free survival rate was 95%, 71.5%, and 71.5% at 1, 3, and 5 years after multiple CK treatments. The 5-year survival rate after CK was 81%. Conclusion(s): CK is an effective and safe management option for hemangiopericytomas. The current series demonstrates a tumor control of 81.8%. Other institutions have demonstrated similar outcomes with stereotactic radiosurgery, with tumor control ranging from 46.4% to 100%. © 2011 Veeravagu et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",Excluded
3474,"Muscle injury following experimental intraoperative irradiation The paraaortic region of beagle dogs was irradiated to 15 to 55 Gy intraoperative irradiation, 10 to 47.5 Gy intraoperative irradiation following 50 Gy external beam irradiation in 25 fractions, or 50 to 80 Gy external beam irradiation in 30 fractions. Six MeV electrons were used for intraoperative irradiation, and external beam irradiation was done using photons from a 6 MV linear accelerator. The psoas muscle in the irradiation field was examined histomorphometrically 2 or 5 years after irradiation. The percentage of muscle fibers and capillaries decreased, whereas the percentage of connective tissue increased with increased dose for both intraoperative irradiation only and intraoperative irradiation plus external beam irradiation. The dose causing a 50% decrease in the percentage of muscle fibers was 21.2 Gy and 33.8 Gy at 2 and 5 years, respectively, after intraoperative irradiation alone, and 22.9 Gy and 25.2 Gy at 2 and 5 years, respectively, after intraoperative irradiation combined with 50 Gy external beam irradiation. The ED50 for severe vessel lesions was 19.2 Gy and 25.8 Gy at 2 and 5 years, respectively, after intraoperative irradiation alone and 16.0 Gy and 18.0 Gy at 2 and 5 years, respectively, after intraoperative irradiation combined with 50 Gy external beam irradiation. External beam irradiation alone caused a slight decrease in percentage of muscle fibers with increased dose, and vessel lesions were infrequent or mild. Radiation-induced muscle injury was characterized by loss of muscle fibers, decreased fiber size, severe vessel lesions, hemorrhage, inflammation, coagulation necrosis, and fibrosis. These histopathologic characteristics distinguish this muscle injury from that caused by neurogenic atrophy. These data indicate that radiation-induced muscle injury most likely was caused by injury of the supporting vasculature. The lesions produced were largely a function of the single intraoperative dose rather than the external beam fractionated doses. Furthermore, it appears that 20 to 25 Gy intraoperative irradiation combined with 50 Gy external beam irradiation may be near the maximum tolerated dose by sublumbar musculature and its supporting vasculature.",Excluded

1125,"Diagnostic yield of CT pulmonary angiography for pulmonary embolism in clinically suspected patients ABSTRACT: Pulmonary embolism (PE) is a common medical problem. Its diagnostic criteria must be reviewed to determine the need for confirmatory testing. Computed tomography pulmonary angiography (CTPA) is the current standard of care, which provides accurate diagnosis with rapid turnaround. This study aimed to estimate the diagnostic yield of CTPA in clinically suspected PE patients in a tertiary care hospital in Saudi Arabia.Radiology records of all patients with clinically suspected PE who underwent CTPA between January 1, 2012 and September 30, 2018 were reviewed retrospectively. A radiologist with 10 years of professional experience interpreted and reported all cases. The Wells score with 2 tiers (likely and unlikely) was used to raise the clinical suspicion of PE.Positive results for PE were reported in 177 out of 534 clinically suspected cases (33%). Among the positive PE cases, 143 were acute (81%) and 34 (19%) were chronic. Bilateral, right-sided, and left-sided PE were found in 115 (65%), 37 (21%), and 25 (14%) cases, respectively. Involvement of the segmental branches, subsegmental branches, and the pulmonary trunk were noted in 152 (86%), 70 (40%), and 9 cases (5%), respectively. Saddle PE was found in (4%) of the cases. The lower lobe branches (right 55%, left 53%) and the upper lobe branches (right 47%, left 41%) were the most common sites of involvement.CTPA had a higher positive detection rate for PE among clinically suspected cases than its published diagnostic yield. Adequate clinical evaluation when selecting patients for CTPA is emphasized to minimize unjustified exposure of the patients to radiation and intravenous contrast administration. It is crucial for radiologists to provide detailed reports commenting on all relevant findings, including pertinent negatives. A template for reporting radiological findings for CTPA can be recommended for this purpose.Copyright © 2021 the Author(s). Published by Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.",Excluded
2913,"Parotid-sparing intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) for nasopharyngeal carcinoma: preserved parotid function after IMRT on quantitative salivary scintigraphy, and comparison with historical data after conventional radiotherapy PURPOSE: To evaluate the parotid function after parotid-sparing intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) in patients with nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC)., METHODS AND MATERIALS: From March 2003 to May 2004, 16 patients with nonmetastatic NPC underwent parotid-sparing IMRT. Eight of these patients had Stage III or IV NPC based on the 1997 American Joint Committee on Cancer staging system. The post-IMRT parotid function was evaluated by quantitative salivary scintigraphy and represented by the maximal excretion ratio (MER) of the parotid gland after sialogogue stimulation. The parotid function of 16 NPC patients who were previously treated with conventional radiotherapy was reviewed as the historical control., RESULTS: In the parotid-sparing IMRT group, all 16 patients were alive and without cancer at the end of follow-up period (median, 24.2 months). The mean parotid MER was 53.5% before radiotherapy, 10.7% at 1 month post-IMRT, and 23.3% at 9 months post-IMRT. In the conventional radiotherapy group, the mean parotid MER was 0.6% at 6 to 12 months postradiotherapy. The difference was statistically significant (23.3% vs. 0.6%, p<0.001, Mann-Whitney test). In the IMRT group, the mean parotid doses ranged from 33.2 Gy to 58.8 Gy (average, 43.9 Gy). The correlation between the mean parotid dose and the percentage decrease of parotid MER at 9 months post-IMRT (dMER) was statically significant (p=0.008, Pearson correlation)., CONCLUSIONS: Although the mean parotid doses are relatively high, the significant preservation of parotid function is achieved with IMRT for NPC patients. The significant correlation between mean parotid dose and parotid dMER demonstrates the dose-function relationship of the parotid gland.",Excluded

Little is known regarding MPI practice in Africa. We sought to characterise radiation doses and the use of MPI best practices that could minimise radiation in African nuclear cardiology laboratories, and compare these to practice worldwide., METHODS: Demographics and clinical characteristics were collected for a consecutive sample of 348 patients from 12 laboratories in six African countries over a one-week period from March to April 2013. Radiation effective dose (ED) was estimated for each patient. A quality index (QI) enumerating adherence to eight best practices, identified a priori by an IAEA expert panel, was calculated for each laboratory. We compared these metrics with those from 7 563 patients from 296 laboratories outside Africa., RESULTS: Median (interquartile range) patient ED in Africa was similar to that of the rest of the world [9.1 (5.1-15.6) vs 10.3 mSv (6.8-12.6), p = 0.14], although a larger proportion of African patients received a low ED, <= 9 mSv targeted in societal recommendations (49.7 vs 38.2%, p < 0.001). Bestpractice adherence was higher among African laboratories (QI score: 6.3 +/- 1.2 vs 5.4 +/- 1.3, p = 0.013). However, median ED varied significantly among African laboratories (range: 2.0-16.3 mSv; p < 0.0001) and QI range was 4-8., CONCLUSION: Patient radiation dose from MPI in Africa was similar to that in the rest of the world, and adherence to best practices was relatively high in African laboratories. Nevertheless there remain opportunities to further reduce radiation exposure to African patients from MPI.",Excluded

819,"Role of aortic calcification, stiffness and wave reflections in cardiovascular risk in dialysis patients: Baseline data from the CORD study Background: Accurate cardiovascular risk estimation in dialysis patients remains challenging because different pathogenetic mechanisms act simultaneously in this heterogeneous population. Radiographic calcification, aortic stiffness and wave reflection, have each individually been proven to be reliable surrogate markers for outcome. We aimed to explore to what extent these parameters intermutually provide complementary or overlapping information. Method(s): Abdominal aortic calcification scoring of a plain lateral abdominal X-ray, carotid-femoral pulse wave velocity (PWV), and central augmentation index (AIx) were measured in 1084 dialysis patients, recruited from 47 European dialysis centers. Result(s): Abdominal calcification correlated well with PWV (R = 0.44, P < 0.001) but poorly with AIx (R = 0.07, P = 0.04). Next to abdominal calcification, tertiles of PWV were associated with a stepwise increase age, blood pressure, and cardiovascular history, and tertiles of AIx with age, heart rate, and anthropometric factors. In multivariate analysis, only PWV remained significantly associated with calcification score. In addition to age and blood pressure, stiffness was mainly related to diabetes and calcification score (R2 = 0.39, P < 0.001), whereas AIx was more dependent on anthropometry, gender and heart rate (R2 = 0.36, P < 0.001). Conclusion(s): Information on aortic calcification and arterial abnormalities can be obtained by simple and inexpensive methodologies. Variation in wave reflections was mainly explained by anthropometric parameters. Stiffness and calcification partly provided complementary information, particularly in low-risk patients. In this group, likely to benefit most from preventive strategies and commonly considered for renal transplantation, evaluation of cardiovascular risk could be made more accurate by the assessment of both aortic calcification and arterial stiffness. © 2010 Association for Research into Arterial Structure and Physiology.",Excluded
3426,"Medically inoperable peripheral lung cancer treated with stereotactic body radiation therapy BACKGROUND: Lung cancer is the most frequent cause of cancer-related death in North America. There is wide variation between patients who are medically inoperable and those managed surgically. The use of stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) has narrowed the gap in survival rates between operative and non-operative management for those with early stage disease. This retrospective study reports outcomes for the treatment of peripheral non-small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC) with SBRT from a single community practice., METHODS: Sixty-seven consecutive patients (pts) with inoperable, untreated peripheral lung tumors were treated from 2010 through 2012 and included in this study. Stereotactic targeting was facilitated by either spine or lung-based image guidance, either with or without fiducial marker tracking with a frameless robotic radiosurgery system. Peripheral tumors received a median biological effective dose (BED) of 105.6 Gy10 or in terms of a median physical dose, 48 Gy delivered over 4 daily fractions. Survival was measured using the Kaplan-Meier method to determine rates of local control, progression of disease and overall survival. The Cox proportional hazards regression model was used to study the effects of tumor size, stage, histology, patient age, tumor location (lobe), tracking method, and BED on the survival distributions., RESULTS: The median follow-up for this cohort was 24.5 months (range: 2.4-50.3) with an overall (OS) 3-year survival of 62.4 % (95 % CI: 74.3-47.3). The median progression-free survival was 28.5 months (95 % CI: 15.8 months to not reached). Local control (LC), defined as a lack of FDG uptake on PET/CT or the absence of tumor growth was achieved in 60 patients (90.9 %) at the time of first follow-up (median 3 months, range: 1-6). Local control at one year for the entire cohort was 81.8 % (95 % CI, 67.3-90.3). The one-year OS probability among those who achieved local control at first follow-up was 86.2 % (95 % CI, 74.3-92.9) but no patients who did not achieve LC at first follow-up survived one year. Of the 60 pts that achieved initial LC, 16 have died. The rates of local control, progression-free survival and overall survival were not statistically different for patients treated using a fiducial target tracking system versus non-invasive guidance. (p = 0.44, p = 0.97 and p = 0.66, respectively). No National Cancer Institute (NCI) Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE-4) grade 3 or greater toxicity was observed., CONCLUSION: SBRT is an effective treatment for medically inoperable NSCLC patients with peripherally located tumors. This therapy appears to be well tolerated with low toxicity, and patient outcomes when using non-invasive tumor tracking systems are not inferior to traditional fiducial-based techniques.",Excluded

Material(s) and Method(s): 488 esophageal cancer patients treated with CCRT with and without surgery were analyzed. The EDIC model considers the exposure of circulating immune cells as the proportion of blood flow to lung, heart, liver, and the volume of the exposed area of the body, with the basis of mean lung dose (MLD), mean heart dose (MHD), mean liver dose (MlD), and integral dose (ITD) of the body region scanned, calculated as: EDIC=0.12*MLD+0.08*MHD+0.15*0.85*MlD*[Formula presented]1/2+0.45+0.35*0.85*[Formula presented]1/2*[Formula presented] Where n is the fraction number. Correlations of EDIC with overall survival (OS), progression free survival (PFS), distant metastasis free survival (DMFS), and locoregional control (LRC) rates were analyzed using both univariable and multivariable Cox models. Lymphopenia during CCRT was graded according to Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events version 4.0. Result(s): Grade 4 lymphopenia resulted in inferior clinical outcomes, including OS, PFS, and DMFS. The median EDIC was 3.6 Gy (range, 0.8-6.0 Gy). Higher EDIC was strongly associated with severe lymphopenia, particularly when EDIC was above 4 Gy. Patients with EDIC > 4.0 Gy had more G4 lymphopenia than those with EDIC <= 4.0 Gy (67.3% vs. 40.8%; P < 0.001). On multivariate analysis, increasing EDIC was independently and inversely associated with worse OS, PFS, and DMFS. Conclusion(s): EDIC can be recommended as a useful tool to predict lymphopenia and inferior clinical outcomes, and it should be minimized below 4 Gy.Copyright © 2020 Elsevier B.V.",Excluded
1647,"Lung tumour induction in mice after uniform and non-uniform external thoracic X-irradiation The aim of this study was to investigate the validity of the ICRP procedure of using average tissue/organ dose in estimating carcinogenic risk. It has been suggested that highly non-uniform exposure ('hot spots') is much more carcinogenic than an equivalent dose delivered uniformly. In a series of experiments, mice were irradiated with X-rays either uniformly to the thorax or non-uniformly with 72 1-mm microbeams which irradiated approximately 20 per cent of the total lung volume. Two experiments involving uniform irradiation showed a peaked tumour incidence curve with a maximum at 5 Gy. The first 'microbeam' study also produced a pronounced peak in the dose response with a maximum tumour incidence at 1 Gy average lung dose or 5 Gy to the irradiated lung tissue. This implied the use of average tissue dose might underestimate the carcinogenic hazard of non-uniform exposure. Later, more extensive, microbeam experiments failed to replicate this finding. The results were nearly similar to those for uniform irradiation, with a slight increase in tumour incidence from 2.5-5.0 Gy average lung dose. These results imply that for these irradiation conditions the ICRP dose averaging procedure remains valid.",Excluded
1047,"Thermophysiological consequences of whole body resonant RF exposure (100 MHz) in human volunteers Thermophysiological responses of heat production and heat loss were measured in seven adult volunteers (six males and one female, aged 31-74 years) during 45 min dorsal exposures of the whole body to 100 MHz continuous wave (CW) radio frequency (RF) energy. Three power densities (PD) (average PD = 4, 6, and 8 mW/cm(2); whole body specific absorption rate [SAR] = 0.068 [W/kg]/[mW/cm(2)]) were tested in each of three ambient temperatures (T(a) = 24, 28, and 31 degrees C), as well as in T(a) controls (no RF). A standardized protocol (30 min baseline, 45 min RF or sham exposure, 10 min baseline) was used. Measured responses included esophageal and seven skin temperatures, metabolic heat production, local sweat rate, and local skin blood flow. No changes in metabolic heat production occurred under any test condition. Unlike published results of similar exposures at 450 and 2450 MHz, local skin temperatures, even those on the back that were irradiated directly, changed little or not at all during 100 MHz exposures. The sole exception was the temperature of the ankle skin, which increased by 3-4 degrees C in some subjects at PD = 8 mW/cm(2). During the 45 min RF exposure, esophageal temperature showed modest changes (range = -0.15 to 0.13 degrees C) and never exceeded 37.2 degrees C. Thermoregulation was principally controlled by appropriate increases in evaporative heat loss (sweating) and, to a lesser extent, by changes in skin blood flow. Because of the deep penetration of RF energy at this frequency, effectively bypassing the skin, these changes must have been stimulated by thermal receptors deep in the body rather than those located in the skin.

Method(s): This randomized controlled trial was approved by the institutional review board, and informed consent was obtained. Patients presenting to the emergency department with an acute abdomen and who would normally be investigated with AR were randomized to either AR or LDCT. The estimated radiation dose of the LDCT protocol was 2-3mSv compared to 1.1mSv for AR. Pearson's chi-square and the independent samples t-test were used for the statistical analysis. Result(s): A total of 142 patients were eligible, and after exclusions and omitting those with incomplete data, 55 patients remained for analysis in the AR arm and 53 in the LDCT arm. A diagnosis could be obtained in 12 (21.8%) patients investigated with AR compared to 34 (64.2%) for LDCT (P < 0.001). Twenty-eight (50.9%) patients in the AR group required further imaging during their admission compared to 14 (26.4%) in the LDCT group (P= 0.009). There was no difference in the median hospital LOS (3.84 days for AR versus 4.24 days for LDCT, P= 0.83).

2211,"Totally automatic definition of renal regions of interest from 99mTc-MAG3 renograms: validation in patients with normal kidneys and in patients with suspected renal obstruction INTRODUCTION: An image-processing algorithm (AUTOROI) has been developed to totally automatically (or with manual assistance) detect whole-kidney contours and generate renal regions of interest (ROI) for the extraction of the quantitative measurements used in the interpretation of Tc-mercaptoacetyltriglycine (Tc-MAG3) renograms., METHODS: The 18-20th min dynamic frames post-MAG3 injection were used to automatically define boxes surrounding each kidney, which were then transposed to an early composite image for interpolative and directional background subtraction. Sobel operator and unsharp masking were applied for edge enhancement, and the resulting image histograms were equalized to better define poorly functioning kidneys. AUTOROI searched radially from the center of mass to define each kidney's ROI coordinates. AUTOROI was validated using MAG3 studies from 79 patients referred for suspected obstruction (79 left, 77 right kidneys) and 19 kidney donors with normal kidney function and no obstruction. Renal ROIs were manually defined by a nuclear medicine technologist with 20+ years of experience (reference standard) and an American Board of Nuclear Medicine certified physician. AUTOROI and physician ROIs were automatically compared with the reference standard to determine the border definition error., RESULTS: AUTOROI totally automatically detected the renal borders in 89% (172 of 194) of the kidneys from the entire group of 98 patients. The 22 kidneys missed automatically were subsequently detected with the assistance of a single manually placed fiducial point demarcating the liver/kidney boundary. These 22 kidneys were shown to be associated with markedly reduced MAG3 clearance. The mean error of AUTOROI for all 194 kidneys was 6.66+/-3.77 and 7.31+/-4.52 mm for the left and right kidney, respectively. The physician's error was 6.78+/-2.42 and 6.65+/-2.05 mm for the left and right kidney, respectively. This error difference between AUTOROI and the physician was not statistically significant., CONCLUSION: AUTOROI provides an objective and promising approach to automated renal ROI detection.",Excluded
3189,"Radiation therapy for intrahepatic recurrence after hepatectomy for hepatocellular carcinoma BACKGROUND: The intrahepatic recurrence rate after curative hepatectomy for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is high, and management of recurrence is thus important for long-term survival. The use of radiation therapy has been relatively uncommon in the treatment of recurrent HCC., METHODS: Eight patients underwent radiation therapy for recurrent HCC 12-98 months after hepatectomy. Five of them were treated with protons (250 MeV; 68.8-84.5 Gy), and three were treated with X-rays (6 MV; 60 or 70 Gy). One patient received radiation therapy twice for another lesion with a 79-month interval. The target tumors were 1.2-4.5 cm. All patients also underwent transcatheter arterial embolization or other regional therapy., RESULTS: Although transient ascites was found in three patients after radiation therapy, no patient died as a result of the irradiation. Seven patients died 9 months to 4 years (median 1 year 6 months) after radiation therapy. Re-recurrence was observed in the irradiated liver in two patients (local control 78%). Four patients died of lung metastasis after radiation therapy. The median survival time was 3 years 3 months (range 1 year 1 month to 8 years 6 months) after recurrence., CONCLUSION: Multimodality therapy is necessary for the management of recurrence. Radiation therapy could be beneficial when other therapies present some difficulty regarding application or are performed incompletely. It must be emphasized that radiation therapy should be considered in addition to other regional therapies for the treatment of recurrent or re-recurrent HCC, and that radiation therapy can be repeated in selected patients.",Excluded
1440,"MiR-19 in blood plasma reflects lung cancer occurrence but is not specifically associated with radon exposure Radon is one of the most powerful carcinogens, particularly in terms of lung cancer onset and development. miRNAs may be considered not only as markers of the ongoing tumorigenesis but also as a hallmark of exposure to radiation, including radon and its progeny. Therefore, the purpose of the present study was to estimate the value of plasma miR-19b-3p level as the prospective marker of the response to radon exposure in lung cancer pathogenesis. A total of 136 subjects were examined, including 49 radon-exposed patients with lung cancer, 37 patients with lung cancer without radon exposure and 50 age/sex matched healthy controls. Total RNA from blood samples was extracted and used to detect miR-19b-3p expression via reverse transcription quantitative-polymerase chain reaction. The 2-DELTADELTACq method was used to quantify the amount of relative miRNA. The plasma level of p53 protein was determined using a Human p53 ELISA kit. Plasma miR-19b-3p level was significantly higher in the patients with lung cancer groups, compared with the healthy control group (P<0.0001). No other statistically significant differences were determined in the expression level of plasma miR-19b-3p between patients diagnosed with lung cancer exposed to radon and not exposed to radon. The expression level of free circulating miR-19b-3p was higher in the group of non-smoking patients with lung cancer, compared with smokers with lung cancer. The miR-19b-3p was 1.4-fold higher in non-smokers than in smokers (P<0.05). No association between plasma levels of p53 protein and miR-19b-3p freely circulating in patients with lung cancer was observed. No other statistically significant differences were determined in the plasma p53 protein level between patients diagnosed with lung cancer exposed and not exposed to radon. These results indicated that detection of miR-19b-3p levels in plasma potentially could be exploited as a noninvasive method for the lung cancer diagnostics. However, this miRNA is not suitable as the precise marker for radon impact.Copyright © 2018, Spandidos Publications. All rights reserved.",Included
314,"Mortality among diagnostic medical radiation workers in South Korea, 1996-2015 OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the risk for all-cause and cause-specific mortality in diagnostic medical radiation workers in South Korea., METHODS: The study population included all diagnostic medical radiation workers enrolled in the National Dosimetry Registry (NDR) between 1996 and 2011. NDR data were linked with mortality data obtained from national registries through 2015. Standardised mortality ratios (SMRs) and relative standardised mortality ratios (rSMRs) were calculated for external comparison and for adjustment of the cohort's overall healthiness., RESULTS: A total of 1099 deaths (974 in men and 125 in women) were reported from among 80 837 medical radiation workers. The SMRs for all causes of death were significantly lower than expected in both men (SMR 0.45, 95% CI 0.42 to 0.48) and women (SMR 0.49, 95% CI 0.41 to 0.58). No excesses were observed for any specific cause of death. The findings were similar by job title, calendar year of entry and year of birth. However, relative to all causes of death, mortality from all cancers (rSMR 1.60, 95% CI 1.41 to 1.82), leukaemia, colon cancer, stomach cancer and diseases of the circulatory system increased significantly among male workers. The results for female workers were limited due to small number of deaths; however, the rSMR for all cancers was significantly elevated (rSMR 1.70, 95% CI 1.17 to 2.46)., CONCLUSIONS: This cohort showed lower mortality among diagnostic medical radiation workers than in the general population. However, occupational factors may have been involved in the increased relative mortality for several causes of death. Copyright © Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2018. No commercial re-use.

3681,"Magnetic resonance imaging of musculoskeletal neoplasms MRI has been shown to be very useful in the work-up of musculoskeletal neoplasms. The lack of ionizing radiation, the superb contrast resolution, and the ability to directly scan the sagittal and coronal planes make MRI a very attractive imaging mode for treatment planning. With spin-echo MRI, maximum contrast between tumor and fatty tissues generally occurs with short TR and TE times (T1-weighted images). Likewise, maximum contrast between tumor and muscle, tendon, or ligaments occurs with long values of TR and TE (T2-weighted images). Early experience suggests that the already exceptional contrast resolution seen with MRI can be improved even more with the administration of intravenous contrast agents. Just as with CT, fatty tumors can usually be easily distinguished from other tissue types with MRI by means of their differential intensity behavior at different pulse sequences. Fluid-filled tumors, such as unicameral bone cysts or aneurysmal bone cysts may be suspected in the same manner, especially if a fluid-fluid level is seen within the lesion. Otherwise, MRI has not been useful so far in noninvasively determining the histologic type of tumors. Our experience and that of others suggests that MRI is equal or superior to CT in the work-up of musculoskeletal neoplasms. This is especially striking when it is remembered that one is comparing an immature MRI technology with a mature CT technology. Although CT presently has a central role in the staging of musculoskeletal tumors, MRI will shortly supplant it in many cases.",Excluded
483,"Occupational risk factors and reproductive health of women BACKGROUND: This in-depth review summarizes and interprets the available recent epidemiologic evidence on the relationship between occupational exposures and negative reproductive outcome among women workers. METHODS: The studies examined by the review include those published in the international scientific literature since 1990, and were identified through the search of relevant data banks using selected keywords. RESULTS: From the examination of studies dealing with exposures of women to chemical agents, pesticides, physical agents, ergonomic factors and stress, it appears that at present the evidence is sufficient to warrant the maximum protection of pregnant women to several well-documented occupational risk factors. These include exposures to anaesthetic gases, antineoplastic drugs, heavy metals, solvents, heavy physical work and irregular work schedules. For other work risks, such as exposure to non-ionizing radiation and psychosocial work stress, the evidence is often suggestive but not conclusive. CONCLUSIONS: Policy makers and health professionals should advise women and employers to avoid exposure to the well-known occupational risk factors, while epidemiologic research should pursue methodological improvements and provide more insight into the magnitude of exposures responsible for detrimental effects.

2346,"Effect of adjunctive low level laser therapy (LLLT) on nonsurgical treatment of chronic periodontitis OBJECTIVE: The aim of this split-mouth, double blinded, short-term, controlled clinical trial was to study the effect of low-level laser therapy (LLLT) as an adjunct to scaling and root planing (SRP) for treatment of chronic periodontitis., BACKGROUND DATA: LLLT is reported to improve the outcome of traditional SRP, but the evidence is still weak., MATERIALS AND METHODS: Sixteen patients with a probing pocket depth (PPD) of 4-6 mm involving at least three teeth in each quadrant were recruited for the study. Afterwards, SRP quadrants were randomly assigned for 10 sessions of LLLT., RESULTS: Results showed that when compared to sites treated with SRP alone, those treated with SRP+LLLT (10 sessions, 830 nm, 100 mW, 3 J per point, 3 J/cm(2)) exhibited greater reductions in PPD at 5 weeks and 3 months but not at 6 months. Further, SRP+LLLT-treated sites had a statistically significant increase in mean radiographic bone density when comparing 6- and 12-month data and overall from baseline to 12 months. There was a trend to reduce interleukin (IL)-1beta but the difference between control and laser sites was not statistically significant., CONCLUSIONS: SRP combined with LLLT improved radiographic bone density and short-term PPD reduction in patients with chronic periodontitis, but did not significantly affect either the gingival crevicular fluid of IL-1beta or the gingival or plaque index.",Excluded
1656,"Detection of Upper Tract Urothelial Malignancies by Computed Tomography Urography in Patients Referred for Hematuria at a Large Tertiary Referral Center Objective To evaluate the age-stratified prevalence of upper tract urothelial malignancies diagnosed on computed tomography urography in a large cohort of patients referred for initial evaluation of hematuria. Materials and Methods A total of 1123 consecutive adults without a history of urothelial cancer underwent initial computed tomography urography for gross hematuria (n = 652), microscopic hematuria (n = 457), or unspecified hematuria (n = 14) at a single institution from October 2006 to October 2012. Imaging findings suggestive of urothelial lesions were correlated with clinical information, including cystoscopy, cytology, and surgical pathology reports. Patients subsequently diagnosed with urothelial cancer following a normal radiographic evaluation were identified and analyzed. Age, gender, smoking history, and location and type of malignancy were analyzed. Results Upper tract urothelial cancer was detected in 4 (0.36%) patients, with a mean age of 66.5 years. All 4 patients presented with gross hematuria and were current or former smokers. None of the 535 patients under age 55 who underwent computed tomography urography were diagnosed with upper tract disease regardless of age, smoking history, or degree of hematuria. Likewise, no upper tract cancers were detected in patients referred for microscopic hematuria, regardless of age. Conclusion Detection of upper tract urothelial cancer by computed tomography urography is exceedingly rare in patients presenting at a tertiary referral center with hematuria, particularly in the lower risk strata (younger age, microscopic hematuria). Further investigation into risk-stratified approaches to imaging for hematuria workup is warranted to minimize unnecessary costs and radiation exposure.Copyright © 2016 Elsevier Inc.",Excluded
2172,"DART-bid: dose-differentiated accelerated radiation therapy, 1.8 Gy twice daily: High local control in early stage (I/II) non-small-cell lung cancer Background: While surgery is considered standard of care for early stage (I/II), non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC), radiotherapy is a widely accepted alternative for medically unfit patients or those who refuse surgery. International guidelines recommend several treatment options, comprising stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) for small tumors, conventional radiotherapy >= 60 Gy for larger sized especially centrally located lesions or continuous hyperfractionated accelerated RT (CHART). This study presents clinical outcome and toxicity for patients treated with a dose-differentiated accelerated schedule using 1.8 Gy bid (DART-bid). Patients and Methods: Between April 2002 and December 2010, 54 patients (median age 71 years, median Karnofsky performance score 70 %) were treated for early stage NSCLC. Total doses were applied according to tumor diameter: 73.8 Gy for < 2.5 cm, 79.2 Gy for 2.5-4.5 cm, 84.6 Gy for 4.5-6 cm, 90 Gy for > 6 cm. Result(s): The median follow-up was 28.5 months (range 2-108 months); actuarial local control (LC) at 2 and 3 years was 88 %, while regional control was 100 %. There were 10 patients (19 %) who died of the tumor, and 18 patients (33 %) died due to cardiovascular or pulmonary causes. A total of 11 patients (20 %) died intercurrently without evidence of progression or treatment-related toxicity at the last follow-up, while 15 patients (28 %) are alive. Acute esophagitis <= grade 2 occurred in 7 cases, 2 patients developed grade 2 chronic pulmonary fibrosis. Conclusion(s): DART-bid yields high LC without significant toxicity. For centrally located and/or large (> 5 cm) early stage tumors, where SBRT is not feasible, this method might serve as radiotherapeutic alternative to present treatment recommendations, with the need of confirmation in larger cohorts.Copyright © 2014, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.",Excluded
2706,"Efficacy of three-dimensional road mapping by fusion of computed tomography angiography and fluoroscopy in endovascular treatment of aorto-iliac chronic total occlusion The efficacy of multimodality image fusion road-mapping technique for endovascular therapy has been reported recently. Our aim was to evaluate the efficacy of endovascular therapy (EVT) with three-dimensional (3D) road mapping by fusing computed tomography (CT) and angiographical volumetric data for aorto-iliac chronic total occlusion (CTO). We retrospectively analyzed 36 patients with aorto-iliac CTO from June 2017 to November 2019 and classified them into two groups: EVT using a CT fused 3D roadmap (CTf3D-RM; 3D group, n = 14) and standard EVT (standard group, n = 22). Primary endpoint was wiring time and secondary endpoints were procedural success rate, number of guidewires, procedure time, radiation dose, contrast medium dose, and complications. Wiring time was significantly shorter in the 3D group than the standard group (3D, 15.6 +/- 10.23 min vs. standard, 44.6 +/- 35.3 min; p = 0.0052). Both groups had high procedural success rates (3D, 100% vs. standard, 100%) and low complication rates (3D, 0.0% vs. standard, 9.1%; p = 0.51). There were significantly fewer guidewires in the 3D group than the standard group (3D, 2.78 +/- 1.31 vs. standard, 4.36 +/- 2.01; p = 0.0138). The 3D group trended towards shorter procedural time (3D, 78.8 +/- 32.5 min vs. standard, 107.5 +/- 52.5 min; p = 0.076), lower radiation dose (3D, 28.6 +/- 18.9 Gycm2 vs. standard, 48.9 +/- 49.2 Gycm2; p = 0.15), and lower contrast medium dose (3D, 102.2 +/- 30.6 vs. standard, 127.5 +/- 51.3; p = 0.11) than the standard group. Therefore, we concluded that EVT with CTf3D-RM is effective for aorto-iliac CTO. This method may improve the quality of aorto-iliac CTO interventions.Copyright © 2020, Springer Japan KK, part of Springer Nature.",Excluded
66,"Occipitocervical fixation in the management of craniocervical instabilities Introduction: The occipitocervical junction presents a unique, complex, biomechanical interface between the cranium and the upper cervical spine. Occipitocervical fixation has undergone significant evolution due to advances in operative techniques and instrumentation techniques. Objective(s): This study was done to evaluate clinical picture, radiographic findings and results of occipitocervical fusion in 10 patients with craniocervical instabilities. Also to compare these results with other results reported in the literature. Method(s): This retrospective study reviewed 10 patients who underwent occipitocervical fixation for craniocervical instabilities between April 2007 and October 2010 in Alexandria hospitals. There were 7 males and 3 females and their ages ranged from 16 to 63. years with mean age of 42.1. years. As regards the clinical presentation, all patients had presented with neck pain before surgery, 8 patients (80%) with myelopathy, and 8 patients (80%) had presented with a neurological deficit either motor or sensory or both. The etiologies of occipitocervical instability in this study were trauma in three patients, rheumatoid arthritis in three patients, tumor in two patients and Down syndrome in two patients. All patients had preoperative craniocervical plain X-ray, CT and MRI examination. All patients underwent occipitocervical fixation surgery with various fixation systems and autologous bone grafts for fusion. Fusion was assessed by plain cervical X-ray films and CT scan, and the neurological outcome by Frankel grade. The mean follow-up period was 14.7. months (range, 4-24. months) including both clinical and radiological examinations. Result(s): There were no operative mortalities or vascular injuries in this series. Two patients showed transient neurological deterioration postoperatively that had resolved within three months. Two cases had superficial wound infection and one case had cerebrospinal fluid leak. The mean operation time was 207. min (range 130-320. min) and the mean volume of blood loss was 354. mL (range 120-750. mL). Neck pain improved in all patients and no new instability developed at adjacent levels. Regarding the Frankel grade, five patients had shown improvement (Three patients improved from Frankel grade C to grade D, one patient from grade A to grade B and one patient from grade D to grade E), while five patients remained stationary at the same grade. At the last follow-up examination period, a solid fusion was achieved in nine patients out of ten (90%). Conclusion(s): Occiptocervical fixation is indicated in the management of craniocervical instabilities resulting from trauma, rheumatoid arthritis, tumors and congenital anomalies of the craniocervical junction. Accurate imaging studies and proper patient selection are the keys to a successful outcome. Occipitocervical fusion procedures can be performed with low morbidity. A comprehensive knowledge of the anatomy of the occipital-cervical junction is imperative. A wide variety of stabilization techniques and instrumentation systems are currently available, each of which has its own advantages and disadvantages. © 2011.",Excluded
3435,"Solar radiation, lip protection, and lip cancer risk in Los Angeles County women (California, United States) A population-based case-control study of 74 women with lip cancer diagnosed from 1978 to 1985 in Los Angeles County (California, United States) and frequency matched to 105 controls investigated the risk of solar radiation and protection from lip sunscreening agents to explore the hypothesis that excess incidence of lip cancer seen in men is due partly to lower rates in women, conferred by frequent use of lip protection. We confirm the importance in women of risk factors similar to those found in men, i.e., fair complexion, sun exposure, and smoking. Risk was related strongly to lifetime solar radiation (odds ratio [OR] = 13.5 for highest quartile of exposure, 95 percent confidence interval [CI] = 4.5-40.6, P trend < 0.0001) and time spent outdoors (OR = 4.7 for highest quartile of average yearly hours, CI = 1.9-12.1, P trend = 0.01). Further, among women with high lifetime solar-radiation exposure, those who used lip protection once a day or less had twice the risk of lip cancer than women who used lip protection more than once a day (OR = 7.3, CI = 1.9-27.2 cf OR = 3.2, CI = 1.1-9.2). These findings show that solar radiation is a major risk factor for lip cancer and suggest that lip sunscreening is protective, thereby supporting the hypothesis that use of lipstick and other sunscreening agents by women has contributed to their lower incidence of this disease.",Excluded

Flt3lg concentrations showed excellent dose discrimination at >= 1 Gy in the time window of 1 to 7 days after exposure except 1 Gy at day 7. Saa1 dose response was limited to the first two days after exposure. A multiplex assay with both proteins showed improved dose classification accuracy.

2142,"Reduction of Delayed Homologous Recombination by Induction of Radioadaptive Response in RaDR-GFP Mice (Yonezawa Effect): An Old Player With a New Role Radiotherapy (RT) treats cancer effectively with high doses of ionizing radiation (IR) to killing cancer cells and shrinking tumors while bearing the risk of developing different side effects, including secondary cancer, which is most concerning for long-term health consequences. Genomic instability (GI) is a characteristic of most cancer cells, and IR-induced GI can manifest as delayed homologous recombination (HR). Radioadaptive response (RAR) is capable of reducing genotoxicity, cell transformation, mutation, and carcinogenesis, but the rational evidence describing its contributions to the reduction of radiation risk, in particular, carcinogenesis, remains fragmented. In this work, to investigate the impact of RAR on high-dose, IR-induced GI measured as delayed HR, the frequency of recombinant cells was comparatively studied under RAR-inducible and -uninducible conditions in the nucleated cells in hematopoietic tissues (bone marrow and spleen) using the Rosa26 Direct Repeat-green fluorescent protein (RaDR-GFP) homozygote mice. Results demonstrated that the frequency of recombinant cells was significantly lower in hematopoietic tissues under RAR-inducible condition. These findings suggest that reduction in delayed HR may be at least a part of the mechanisms underlying decreased carcinogenesis by RAR, and application of RAR would contribute to a more rigorous and scientifically grounded system of radiation protection in RT.Copyright © The Author(s) 2019.",Included

Level 1 evidence, largely predicated on the German Rectal Cancer Study, supports neoadjuvant treatment for patients with stage II/III rectal cancer. The purpose of this study was to determine to what extent this evidence has affected clinical practice. Stage II/III rectal cancer patients undergoing surgery from 1998 to 2007 were identified in the SEER tumor registry. Variables were analyzed with SPSS software. Trends were evaluated with regression models. Survivals were compared with the log-rank test. A total of 22,136 patients were identified and 15,021 (67.8%) were treated with adjuvant radiotherapy. A large percentage were >60 years old (64.4%), white (83.0%), male (58.8%), at stage III (55.1%), and treated with neoadjuvant radiotherapy (35.5%). A significant increase in the use of neoadjuvant radiotherapy occurred: from 17% in 1998 to 51% in 2007 (p < 0.001). Scatter-plot best-fit lines for neoadjuvant and adjuvant radiotherapy intersected at approximately year 2002. Significant increases in preoperative radiotherapy were observed for all races and cancer stages (p < 0.001).

2916,"The evaluation of different radiological measurement parameters of the degree of collapse of the vertebral body in vertebral compression fractures For compression fracture, vertebral body height loss (VBHL) and kyphotic angle (KA) are two important imaging parameters for determining the prognosis and appropriate treatment. This study used previous measurement methods to assess the degree of VBHL and KA, compare and examine differences between various measurement methods, and examine the correlation between relevant measurement parameters and intravertebral cleft (IVC) in the vertebral body. The radiographic images (lateral view of the T-L spine) of 18 patients with a single-level vertebral compression fracture were reviewed. We measured 9 characteristic lengths and angles on plain radiographs, including anterior vertebral height (AVH) and AVH of the adjacent upper and lower levels, middle vertebral height (MVH) and MVH of the adjacent upper and lower levels, posterior vertebral height (PVH), and vertebral body width, and assessed 6 parameters, including vertebral compression ratio (VBCR), percentage of anterior height compression (PAHC), percentage of middle height compression (PMHC), kyphotic angle (KA), calculated kyphotic angle (CKA), and IVC. The results showed that VBCR is a simple and rapid method of VBHL assessment, but it may result in an underestimation of the degree of VBHL compared to PAHC. When PMHC < 40% or kyphotic angle > 15degree, the probability of IVC occurring on the vertebral body was higher which means the higher risk of vertebral body instability. The results of this study could provide a reference for surgeons when using imaging modalities to assess the degree of vertebral body collapse.Copyright © 2019 Wei-En Hsu et al.

372,"Low-dose MDCT and CT enterography of patients with crohn disease: Feasibility of adaptive statistical iterative reconstruction OBJECTIVE. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the image quality and diagnostic performance of low-dose MDCT and CT enterography with adaptive statistical iterative reconstruction (ASIR) in the evaluation of Crohn disease. SUBJECTS AND METHODS. Forty-eight patients (20 men, 28 women; mean age, 33.3 years; range, 17-83 years) with known or suspected Crohn disease who underwent low-dose MDCT and CT enterography with ASIR between December 2008 and December 2009 were included in the study. Twenty-seven patients had previously undergone standard-dose 64-MDCT and CT enterography with filtered back projection (FBP), and those images were used for comparison. The weight-based IV contrast protocol and scan parameters (120 kVp, 5-mm section thickness, 0.5-second rotation, pitch of 1.375, 64 x 0.625 mm detector configuration) were constant for the two techniques except for a higher noise index (x1.3) in the ASIR group. Two blinded readers reviewed 75 randomized MDCT-CT enterographic scans of 48 patients to assess image quality and diagnostic performance in the evaluation of Crohn disease, and the radiation dose for the studies was estimated. RESULTS. All 75 MDCT and CT enterographic scans had acceptable quality for diagnostic interpretation. Findings of Crohn disease were seen on 63 of 75 scans (84%). Low-dose scans in the ASIR group had optimal image quality and were rated comparable to or better than standard-dose FBP images (mean score, 4.2 vs 3.87; p = 0.007). The subjective image noise score (mean, 1.43 vs 1.58; p = 0.2) and objective image noise measurements were lower for ASIR images (p < 0.001). Low-dose studies with ASIR allowed average dose reduction of 34.5% compared with standard-dose scans with FBP (volume CT dose index for ASIR, 7.7 +/- 2.1 mGy; for FBP, 12 +/- 5.5 mGy; p < 0.01).

Low-dose MDCT and CT enterographic studies reconstructed with ASIR were of appropriate quality for confident evaluation of the manifestations of Crohn disease while allowing approximately 34% dose reduction in comparison with FBP technique. © American Roentgen Ray Society.",Excluded
2856,"Radiotherapy in the treatment of solitary plasmacytoma Solitary plasmacytoma of bone (SPB) and extramedullary plasmacytoma (EMP) are rare. High local control rates are reported with radiotherapy, although the optimal dose and extent of radiotherapy portals remains controversial. Between 1983 and 1993, 30 patients with solitary plasmacytoma were seen at the Regional Cancer Centre, Trivandrum, India. 23 patients had SPB and seven EMP. The mean age was 52 years and the male to female ratio 3.2:1. Diagnosis of SPB was confirmed by biopsy in 16 patients and tumour excision in seven. 20 patients received megavoltage radiotherapy to the bone lesion with limited margins, and one received chemotherapy. Two patients who underwent complete tumour excision received no further treatment. All seven patients with EMP received megavoltage radiotherapy, four following biopsy and three after tumour excision. Local control was achieved in all patients with SPB. Nine progressed to multiple myeloma and one developed a solitary plasmacytoma in another bone. Six patients with EMP achieved local control. Three later progressed to multiple myeloma and one had local relapse. Median time to relapse was 28 months in SPB and 30 months in EMP. 5-year overall survival rates were 82% and 57% for patients with SPB and EMP, respectively. The corresponding progression free survival rates were 55% and 50%, respectively. Age, sex, site of tumour, serum M protein and haemoglobin levels did not significantly influence progression free survival. The extent of surgery, radiotherapy dose or time to relapse were not significant prognostic factors. Radiotherapy appears to be an effective modality of treatment of solitary plasmacytoma. No dose-response relationship is observed, and high local control rates are achieved with limited portals. Progression to multiple myeloma is the commonest pattern of failure, although no prognostic factors for progression are identified.

1869,"Significance of radioiodine uptake at 72 hours versus 24 hours after pretreatment with recombinant human thyrotropin for enhancement of radioiodine therapy in patients with symptomatic nontoxic or toxic multinodular goiter OBJECTIVE: To report the effects of pretreatment with recombinant human thyrotropin (rhTSH) on radioiodine uptake (RAIU) and subsequent radioiodine therapy in 30 patients with symptomatic nontoxic or toxic multinodular goiter., METHODS: Patients received a single injection of rhTSH (0.1 mg in 21 and 0.3 mg in 9 patients). Thyroid function tests were performed before and 72 hours after rhTSH administration. Both 4-hour and 24-hour RAIU studies were done after rhTSH administration and repeated at 48 to 52 hours and at 72 hours, respectively. Then all patients were treated with 30 mCi of 131 I., RESULTS: All study patients experienced symptomatic relief by 1 to 2 months. In addition to the previously reported twofold increase over the baseline RAIU at 24 hours, we found that a second 24-hour RAIU showed a further twofold increase (quadrupling of the RAIU over baseline) at 72 hours after administration of 0.1 mg of rhTSH (from 22% to 43%; P<0.001) and 0.3 mg of rhTSH (from 16% to 37%; P = 0.002), with no significant difference between doses on the RAIU at 24 hours or at 72 hours. Additionally, the RAIU value at 4 hours and 52 hours after administration of 0.1 mg and 0.3 mg of rhTSH revealed a fourfold increase for each dose--from 7% to 28% (P<0.001) and from 5% to 21% (P = 0.002), respectively., CONCLUSION: In patients with symptomatic toxic or nontoxic multinodular goiter, 0.1 mg and 0.3 mg of rhTSH were equally efficacious at inducing a quadrupling of the low or low-normal baseline RAIU values at 72 hours after injection. Subsequent radioiodine therapy alleviated compressive and thyrotoxic symptoms in all 30 treated patients. Future studies should help determine doses of rhTSH and radioiodine therapy that are optimal in iodine-sufficient and insufficient regions of the world.",Excluded
2295,"Supermicrosurgical lymphaticovenous anastomosis for a patient with breast lymphedema secondary to breast cancer treatment Breast lymphedema (BLE) has been reported as a complication following breast cancer treatment. As for extremity lymphedema treatment, supermicrosurgical lymphaticovenous anastomosis (LVA) is considered an option for the treatment of progressive BLE refractory to conservative treatments, but no case has been reported so far. We report the first case of BLE successfully treated with supermicrosurgical LVA. A 55-year-old female presented with left BLE after breast conserving surgery and axillary lymph node dissection and adjuvant radiotherapy. After the cancer treatments, the patient suffered from pronounced swelling, sensation of tension, and pain of the left breast with frequent episodes of breast cellulitis. Conservative treatments had been performed for 7 years, but were not effective, and the patient was referred for further surgical treatment. Supermicrosurgical LVA was performed at the left breast. LVA surgery resulted in three anastomoses, in which three lymphatic vessels were anastomosed to three nearby veins in an intima-to-intima coaptation manner. After LVA, the left breast decreased in size, and the sensation of tension disappeared. One year postoperatively, the patient had no distress nor cellulitis episode, and was satisfied with the results of normal breast conditions. Although further clinical studies are required to confirm efficacy, supermicrosurgical LVA has the potential to be an option for the treatment of progressive BLE refractory to conservative treatments.Copyright © 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",Excluded

The data obtained from a small number of animals suggest that stress present in the above-background environment could induce an adaptive response to ionizing radiation. This study did not reveal harmful effects of exposure to low levels of radioactivity. On the contrary, stress present in the above-background area may serve to enhance cellular defense mechanisms.

Material(s) and Method(s): This study was approved by 40 patients with total or partial edentulous maxillary jaws underwent with 85 dental implants. The ISQ values were measured from these 85 implants at baseline and 3 months after placement. Osttell Mentor device was invented to measure the RF value of the implant fixture through the transducer or pin. Measurements were taken 4 times in each direction of the inserted oral dental implant. OPG X-ray images were also obtained to evaluate the bone and neighbouring anatomical structures. Result(s): The ISQ at baseline had a mean value of 58 (SD 5.91) for all implants placed in anterior and posterior sectors of maxillary ridges. The mean ISQ value on the 3rd month (secondary stability) after placement for all implants was 65 (SD 5.55). An ISQ value >=65 was observed in 65 implants (78.82%) after 3 months of placement. Differences between primary and secondary mean ISQ values were statistically significant (p < 0.001). The one year cumulative success rate was 98.3% for tested and inserted oral implants. Conclusion(s): The results of presented study demonstrates and suggests that the influence and reliability of Osstell ISQ values, measured immediately and 3 months after placement it's predictable for the oral implant outcomes, especially analyzing the sensibility of secondary RFA values.Copyright © 2018, Peytchinski, Gospodin Iliev ET.

2550,"Outcomes of stereotactic radiosurgery for foramen magnum meningiomas: an international multicenter study OBJECTIVE Meningiomas are the most common benign extramedullary lesions of the foramen magnum; however, their optimal management remains undefined. Given their location, foramen magnum meningiomas (FMMs) can cause significant morbidity, and complete microsurgical removal can be challenging. Anterior and anterolateral FMMs carry greater risks with surgery, but they comprise the majority of these lesions. As an alternative to resection, stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) has been used to treat FMMs in small case series. To more clearly define the outcomes of SRS and to delineate a rational management paradigm for these lesions, the authors analyzed the safety and efficacy of SRS for FMM in an international multicenter trial. METHODS Seven medical centers participating in the International Gamma Knife Research Foundation (IGKRF) provided data for this retrospective cohort study. Patients who were treated with Gamma Knife radiosurgery and whose clinical and radiological follow-up was longer than 6 months were eligible for study inclusion. Data from pre- and post-SRS radiological and clinical evaluations were analyzed. Stereotactic radiosurgery treatment variables were recorded. RESULTS Fifty-seven patients (39 females and 18 males, with a median age of 64 years) met the study inclusion criteria. Thirty-two percent had undergone prior microsurgical resection. Patients most frequently presented with cranial neuropathy (39%), headache (35%), numbness (32%), and ataxia (30%). Median pre-SRS tumor volume was 2.9 cm3. Median SRS margin dose was 12.5 Gy (range 10-16 Gy). At the last follow-up after SRS, 49% of tumors were stable, 44% had regressed, and 7% had progressed. Progression-free survival rates at 5 and 10 years were each 92%. A greater margin dose was associated with a significantly increased likelihood of tumor regression, with 53% of tumors treated with > 12 Gy regressing. Fifty-two percent of symptomatic patients noted some clinical improvement. Adverse radiation effects were limited to hearing loss and numbness in 1 patient (2%). CONCLUSIONS Stereotactic radiosurgery for FMM frequently results in tumor control or tumor regression, as well as symptom improvement. Margin doses > 12 Gy were associated with increased rates of tumor regression. Stereotactic radiosurgery was generally safe and well tolerated. Given its risk-benefit profile, SRS may be particularly useful in the management of small- to moderate-volume anterior and anterolateral FMMs.",Excluded
3698,"Comparative genomic hybridization analysis of radiation-associated and sporadic meningiomas Ionizing irradiation to the skull is a known risk factor for meningioma development. To gain insight into the molecular mechanisms that underlie radiation-associated meningioma (RAM), we characterized the somatic genetic alterations in 16 RAMs by using comparative genomic hybridization and compared the pattern of alterations with 17 nonradiation-associated meningiomas (non-RAM). Most tumors (29/33;87.9%) displayed at least one DNA copy number alteration, and 11 out of 33 (33%) exhibited four or more changes. The mean number of DNA copy number changes was similar in RAMs (2.4+/-1.9) and in non-RAMs (2.5+/-1.9). The most common DNA losses were noted in chromosome 22 (56.2% in RAM, and 47% in non-RAM) and chromosome 1 (37.5% in RAM and 35.3% in non-RAM), with no significant differences between the two groups. Noteworthy, gain in DNA copy number of chromosomes 8 and 12 was detected in two RAM tumors only. In conclusion, no significant differences were noted between RAMs and non-RAMs regarding the number of genetic changes and the extent and frequency of chromosomes 1 and 22 losses. These preliminary data suggest that the tumorogenic pathways of meningioma formation are similar, regardless of previous skull irradiation.",Included
774,"Epidemiology and environmental risk in hairy cell leukemia Hairy cell leukaemia (HCL) is an orphan subtype of leukaemia which constitutes less than 2% of all leukaemia's, with an incidence of less than 1 per 100,000 persons per annum. Median age at presentation is 55 years and it is 3-4 times more frequent in males. It is also more frequently encountered in whites and less in Asians, Africans and Arabs. The epidemiologic data are multi-factorial and influenced by ethnicity and geographical factors. Other reported associations relate to some environmental exposures and possible occupational factors. Smoking appears to have an inverse correlation with the development of hairy cell leukaemia, while farming and exposure to pesticides, petroleum products, diesel and ionizing radiation have also been reported to be associated with an increased risk. National and international collaborative efforts are needed in order to undertake more extensive studies involving larger patient cohorts, aiming to determine the role of occupational and environmental risk factors in the development of this rare form of chronic leukaemia.Copyright © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

The purpose of this study was to examine the benefits of trimodality therapy [chemoradiation plus surgery, (CRT + S)] by evaluating the surgical outcomes of patients with ESCC in Keiyukai Sapporo Hospital, Japan. We assessed the preoperative and postoperative adverse events, treatment effects of preoperative CRT, metastatic diagnosis of the dissected lymph nodes, and survival. Patients and Methods: Between 2012 and 2018, 148 patients with highly advanced ESCC who underwent preoperative CRT + S were analyzed for diagnosis and staging, preoperative complications, clinical and histopathological effects of CRT in the resected specimens, survival rates, and recurrences. Result(s): The grade 3 and higher complications of preoperative CRT were neutropenia in 3 cases and thrombocytopenia in 1 case. Among the postoperative complications, there were 2 cases (1.4%) of direct surgical death, only tracheobronchial bleeding and liver failure. Using the 11th edition of the classification of esophageal cancer by the Japanese Esophageal Society, 60 patients (40.5%) were classified as grade 3 (negative for cancer cells, pathological complete response). However, 20 of them (33.3%) had metastatic tumor cells in the lymph nodes. The overall 5-year survival rate was 58.5%. Including references to the pathological findings and recurrence patterns, there is no effective diagnostic method for selecting the subsequent approach based on the effectiveness of CRT. Conclusion(s): Planned surgery following CRT was the only solution for achieving better treatment results.

2534,"Validation of the cytokinesis-block micronucleus (CBMN) assay for use as a triage biological dosimetry tool Traditionally, the dicentric chromosome assay (DCA) has been used to derive biological dose estimates for unknown radiological exposures. While sensitive, this assay requires highly trained evaluators and is extremely time consuming. The cytokinesis-block micronucleus (CBMN) assay has been suggested as an alternative to the DCA, as it is much faster to evaluate samples and requires less technical expertise. In order to validate this assay for triage biodosimetry, dose-response curves were generated for six donors at eight doses of gamma-radiation (0-4.0 Gy). Each sample was evaluated by 12 individuals, among three different laboratories and the incidence of micronuclei was determined after counting 50-500 binucleated cells. This study demonstrated that the CBMN assay was capable of detecting radiation doses >or=1 Gy after scoring only 200 binucleated cells. As such, the CBMN assay may provide a sensitive and reliable technique for deployment as an initial screening tool in a large-scale radiological emergency where large numbers of biological dose estimates are required.",Included
3417,"Reinforcing the Importance and Feasibility of Implementing a Low-dose Protocol for CT-guided Biopsies RATIONALE AND OBJECTIVES: This study sought to more definitely illustrate the impact and feasibility of implementing a low-dose protocol for computed tomography (CT)-guided biopsies using size-specific dose estimates and multivariate analyses., MATERIALS AND METHODS: Fifty consecutive CT-guided lung and extrapulmonary biopsies were reviewed before and after implementation of a low-dose protocol (200 patients total, mean age 61 +/- 15 years, 128 women). Analyses of variance with Bonferroni correction were used to compare standard and low-dose protocols in terms of patient demographics, physician experience, target lesion size, total dose-length product, total acquisitions, size-specific dose estimate, signal-to-noise ratio, contrast-to-noise ratio, and lesion conspicuity ratings. All procedures were performed on the same 16-slice CT scanner., RESULTS: Voluntary protocol adherence was 100% (lung) and 89% (extrapulmonary). The low-dose protocol achieved significantly lower total average dose-length product [(lung) 735.6 +/- 599.4 mGy x cm to 252.1 +/- 101.9 mGy x cm, P < .001; (extrapulmonary) 724.7 +/- 545.0 mGy x cm to 392.9 +/- 239.5 mGy x cm, P < .001] and size-specific dose estimate [(lung) 5.2 +/- 0.8 mGy x cm to 4.3 +/- 1.5 mGy, P < .001; (extrapulmonary) 10.1 +/- 6.7 mGy to 6.5 +/- 2.7 mGy, P < .001]. Only the change in protocol was independently associated with lower size-specific dose estimates when controlling for the other variables (P < .0001). This was achieved with no significant differences in signal-to-noise ratio, contrast-to-noise ratio, or lesion conspicuity., CONCLUSIONS: Implementation of a low-dose protocol for CT-guided biopsies resulted in 21% and 36% of size-specific dose estimate reduction for lung and extrapulmonary biopsies, respectively, with excellent adherence. Interventional and body radiologists should implement low dose CT-guidance protocols aiming to improve patient safety. Copyright © 2018 The Association of University Radiologists.

OBJECTIVES: To investigate whether a significant number of normal 1-day stress-rest 99mTc-tetrofosmin myocardial perfusion scintigraphy (MPS) studies can be identified from the low-dose stress acquisition alone, and whether technical staff can find such studies reliably., METHODS: The supervising consultant and four technologists independently graded the stress acquisitions from 200 consecutive MPS studies using a five-point scale. Studies were classified as normal or abnormal according to the final clinical report based on the completed stress-rest protocol., RESULTS: Between 31 and 62 studies (16-31%) were classified as definitely normal from the stress acquisition alone, of which 0-4 (0-9%) proved abnormal on the final report. Of stress studies graded definitely normal by each technologist, the consultant disagreed in 13-34% of cases. Of 78 stress studies graded definitely normal by at least one technologist, 6% turned out to be abnormal and the consultant disagreed in 33%. When there was agreement between at least two technologists (57 studies), the rates fell to 4% and 21% respectively., CONCLUSIONS: Technologists could make the decision to avoid a resting study in up to 30% of patients following a normal low-dose stress acquisition. The supervising nuclear cardiologist would disagree in perhaps one in five cases, even when there was consensus between two or more technologists. These patients would suffer minor inconvenience by being recalled for a rest acquisition on a second day, but there would be important savings in time and radiation exposure for the majority.",Excluded
455,"Oxidative stress and low dose ionizing radiation The field of radiation biochemistry has provided tremendous impact in recent years as extensive research on free radicals has implicated them in radiation damage. An important offshoot of this field is the branch dealing with radiological protection in medical applications like diagnostic radiology. Hence, we decided to investigate the relationship between oxidative stress and low dose ionizing radiation (x-rays) in the work environment of x-ray technicians (radiographers), by comparing their RBC malondialdehyde, % hemolysis, catalase and plasma vitamin E levels with those of controls. There was a significant increase in the susceptibility of RBCs to hemolysis in radiographers compared to controls. Malondialdehyde and catalase levels were slightly increased in the radiographers, but this did not disturb the steady state concentration of their plasma vitamin E. These findings go in favour of theories stating that exposure to low dose ionizing radiation does cause a greater amount of oxidative stress, than that caused during normal routine metabolic processes.",Included

Method(s): Ninety-seven conventional upright sagittal X-ray images from 55 subjects were retrospectively included in this study. Measurements of the parameters of the sagittal spinopelvic balance, i.e., the sacral slope (SS), pelvic tilt (PT), spinal tilt (ST), pelvic incidence (PI) and spinosacral angle (SSA), were obtained manually by identifying specific anatomical landmarks using the SurgiMap Spine software and by the fully automated DL tool. Statistical analysis was performed in terms of the mean absolute difference (MAD), standard deviation (SD) and Pearson correlation, while the paired t test was used to search for statistically significant differences between manual and automated measurements. Result(s): The differences between reference manual measurements and those obtained automatically by the DL tool were, respectively, for SS, PT, ST, PI and SSA, equal to 5.0degree (3.4degree), 2.7degree (2.5degree), 1.2degree (1.2degree), 5.5degree (4.2degree) and 5.0degree (3.5degree) in terms of MAD (SD), with a statistically significant corresponding Pearson correlation of 0.73, 0.90, 0.95, 0.81 and 0.71. No statistically significant differences were observed between the two types of measurement (p value always above 0.05). Conclusion(s): The differences between measurements are in the range of the observer variability of manual measurements, indicating that the DL tool can provide clinically equivalent measurements in terms of accuracy but superior measurements in terms of cost-effectiveness, reliability and reproducibility.Copyright © 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.",Excluded
1668,"Probability of mediastinal involvement in non-small-cell lung cancer: A statistical definition of the clinical target volume for 3-dimensional conformal radiotherapy? Purpose: Conformal irradiation (3D-CRT) of non-small-cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC) is largely based on precise definition of the nodal clinical target volume (CTVn). A reduction of the number of nodal stations to be irradiated would facilitate tumor dose escalation. The aim of this study was to design a mathematical tool based on documented data to predict the risk of metastatic involvement for each nodal station. Methods and Materials: We reviewed the large surgical series published in the literature to identify the main pretreatment parameters that modify the risk of nodal invasion. The probability of involvement for the 17 nodal stations described by the American Thoracic Society (ATS) was computed from all these publications. Starting with the primary site of the tumor as the main characteristic, we built a probabilistic tree for each nodal station representing the risk distribution as a function of each tumor feature. Statistical analysis used the inversion of probability trees method described by Weinstein and Feinberg. Validation of the software based on 134 patients from two different populations was performed by receiver operator characteristic (ROC) curves and multivariate logistic regression. Result(s): Analysis of all of the various parameters of pretreatment staging relative to each level of the ATS map results in 20,000 different combinations. The first parameters included in the tree, depending on tumor site, were histologic classification, metastatic stage, nodal stage weighted as a function of the sensitivity and specificity of the diagnostic examination used (positron emission tomography scan, computed tomography scan), and tumor stage. Software is proposed to compute a predicted probability of involvement of each nodal station for any given clinical presentation. Double cross validation confirmed the methodology. A 10% cutoff point was calculated from ROC and logistic model giving the best prediction of mediastinal lymph node involvement. Conclusion(s): To more accurately define the CTVn in NSCLC three-dimensional conformal radiotherapy, we propose a software that evaluates the risk of mediastinal lymph node involvement from easily accessible individual pretreatment parameters. © 2006 Elsevier Inc.",Excluded
891,"Mesenchymal stromal cells implantation in combination with platelet lysate product is safe for reconstruction of human long bone nonunion Objective: Nonunion is defned as a minimum of 9 months since injury without any visible progressive signs of healing for 3 months.

The present study was performed to investigate the safety of mesenchymal stromal cell (MSC) implantation in combination with platelet lysate (PL) product for treating human long bone nonunion. Material(s) and Method(s): In this case series clinical trial, orthopedic surgeons visited eighteen patients with long bone nonunion, of whom 7 complied with the eligibility criteria. These patients received mesenchymal stromal cells (20 million cells implanted once into the nonunion site using a?uoroscopic guide) in combination with PL product.

721,"Radiation-induced bystander effects in vivo are sex specific Ionizing radiation (IR) effects span beyond the area of direct exposure and can be observed in neighboring and distant naive cells and organs. This phenomenon is termed a 'bystander effect'. IR effects in directly exposed tissue in vivo are epigenetically mediated and distinct in males and females. Yet, IR-induced bystander effects have never been explored in a sex-specificity domain. We used an in vivo mouse model, whereby the bystander effects are studied in spleen of male and female animals subjected to head exposure when the rest of the body is protected by a medical-grade lead shield. We analyzed the induction of DNA damage and alterations in global DNA methylation. Molecular parameters were correlated with cellular proliferation and apoptosis levels. The changes observed in bystander organs are compared to the changes in unexposed animals and animals exposed to predicted and measured scatter doses. We have found the selective induction of DNA damage levels, global DNA methylation, cell proliferation and apoptosis in exposed and bystander spleen tissue of male and female mice. Sex differences were significantly diminished in animals subjected to a surgical removal of gonads.

Experimental animals were exposed to radiation generated by a linear accelerator at the chest and killed after 3 months. Heart tissues from these animals were removed for Masson staining, PPAR-gamma immunohistochemical staining, Western blot analysis and real-time polymerase chain reaction assay (RT-PCR). In addition, the protein expression of matrix metalloprotein-1 (MMP-1), tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase-1 (TIMP-1) and transforming growth factor type beta1 (TGF-beta1), all of which are associated with fibrosis, was measured. Masson staining revealed significant myocardial fibrosis, degeneration and necrosis in rats exposed to radiation. The results of immunohistochemical staining and Western blot analysis showed that PPAR-gamma protein expression in hearts of the irradiation groups was significantly higher than in the control group, especially in myocardium and vascular endothelial (p < 0.05). RT-PCR results also showed a parallel increase in PPAR-gamma mRNA expression in the heart of the irradiation groups compared with the control group (p < 0.05). The expression of MMP-1 protein was not significantly different in three groups (p > 0.05). The expression of TIMP-1 and TGF-beta1 proteins was, however, higher in two irradiation groups than in the control group (p < 0.05). These data demonstrate that PPAR-gamma expression is up-regulated on both mRNA and protein levels in heart injured by radiation.

3516,"Increased susceptibility to ionizing radiation in mice with ST6Gal-1 deficiency Sporadic reports have associated the degree of N-linked alpha2,6 sialylation, mediated by the sialyltransferase ST6Gal-1, with increased chemo-and radio-resistance of tumor cells, therapeutic failures in colorectal cancers, and protection against Fas-mediated apoptosis. Radiation exposure, whether iatrogenic or accidental, is a significant health concern. ST6Gal-1 has been suggested as a candidate biomarker for exposure to ionizing radiation; both enzyme expression and the level of protein sialylation increase following radiation exposure in a dose dependent manner. Here we report a striking sensitivity of animals with non-functional ST6Gal-1 to ionizing radiation. We attempted to rescue st6gal1-KO and wild-type C57BL/6J mice that were subjected to 12 Gy full body irradiation by bone marrow transplantation with congenic wild-type marrow cells. While the wild-type, st6gal1-normal animals uniformly survived the procedure, st6gal1-KO mice suffered 100% morbidity within 8 days of irradiation. There was comparable homing and retention of donor cells to the marrow of st6gal1-KO and wild-type recipients, and failure of hematopoietic cell engraftment was unlikely as a cause for morbidity. However, st6gal1-KO recipients suffered heavy damage to the gastrointestinal tract resulting in an almost complete loss of absorptive tissue and integrity of the gastrointestinal architecture. This damage was far less severe in the wild-type recipients. Damage to the gastrointestinal tract is an especially frequent and detrimental complication of radiation used in cancer therapy. Our data indicate a critical role for ST6Gal-1 in the maintenance of radioresistance in the gastrointestinal tract.",Included
3330,"Endocrine function and reproductive impairment in an irradiated population of the lizard Uta stansburiana This study describes gonadal changes in lizards (Uta stansburiana) exposed to chronic low levels of gamma radiation (1.5-10 R/day) under field conditions and attempts to evaluate endocrine involvement in these changes. Reproductive impairment in irradiated males is demonstrated during the breeding season by reduced testes weights and by seminiferous tubules devoid of germ cells. Ultrastructural morphology of Leydig cells, plasma testosterone levels, and developed accessory sex structures indicate normal steroidogenesis in such males; cytology of the pituitary gonadotropes and pituitary gonadotropin content indicate normal gonadotropin levels. These findings suggest that low levels of radiation affect the spermatogenic process directly, rather than through damage to the pituitary. Comparable irradiation causes complete resorption of ovarian tissue in some female Uta. The oviducts are atrophic and the pituitary gonadotropes hyperactive. Resemblance of gonadotropes to those of castrated animals and reduced pituitary hormone content suggest elevated levels of gonadotropin production, probably due to the absence of ovarian steroid feedback in affected animals. The continued mitotic activity of oogonia in adult reptiles and their limited number contribute to the vulnerability of germinal tissue in irradiated female lizards. Destruction of the germ cells is accompanied by resorption of all ovarian tissue including steroidogenic elements. Thus, in females as in males, radiation appears to damage gametogenesis rather than pituitary function.",Excluded

Ultra-performance liquid chromatography-electrospray ionization quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry analysis was carried out on a time course of clean-catch urine samples collected from nonhuman primates (n = 6 per cohort) exposed to sham, 1.0, 3.5, 6.5 or 8.5 Gy doses of (60)Co gamma ray (~0.55 Gy/min) ionizing radiation. By multivariate data analysis, 13 biomarkers of radiation were discovered: N-acetyltaurine, isethionic acid, taurine, xanthine, hypoxanthine, uric acid, creatine, creatinine, tyrosol sulfate, 3-hydroxytyrosol sulfate, tyramine sulfate, N-acetylserotonin sulfate, and adipic acid. N-Acetyltaurine, isethionic acid, and taurine had previously been identified in rats, and taurine and xanthine in mice after ionizing radiation exposure. Mass spectrometry-based metabolomics has thus successfully revealed and verified urinary biomarkers of ionizing radiation exposure in the nonhuman primate for the first time, which indicates possible mechanisms for ionizing radiation injury.",Included

Method(s): Eighty-eight studies on 84 patients underwent pelvic and lower-extremity CT venography under protocol A (standard 120 kV with 150 mL of contrast material, n = 44) or protocol B (80 kV with 100 mL of contrast material, n = 44) on a 64-detector CT scanner. We compared the dose length product in the 2 protocols. Two blinded observers measured CT attenuation in the veins, the image noise, contrast-to-noise ratio, and figure of merit. Result(s): The mean dose length product was significantly lower under protocol B than A (603.2 [SD, 67.2] vs 1131.7 [SD, 67.0] mGy x cm) (P < 0.01). Mean CT attenuation of the veins was significantly greater with protocol B (125.3 [SD, 16.2] vs 106.1 [SD, 16.0] Hounsfield units) (P < 0.01), and the mean image noise was also significantly higher under protocol B (6.6 [SD, 0.8] vs 4.9 [SD, 0.7] Hounsfield units) (P < 0.01). There was no difference in contrast-to-noise ratio (P = 0.46). Figure of merit was significantly higher under protocol B (P < 0.01). Conclusion(s): Computed tomography venography with a low-tube-voltage technique allows reducing the radiation dose and the amount of contrast material without image quality degradation.

3027,"CT appearance of acute radiation-induced injury in the lung To determine how soon radiation-induced lung injury is detectable, to compare the CT findings with those on chest radiographs, and to observe the appearance of the abnormality during the acute phase, we performed 83 CT studies in 17 radiotherapy patients at relatively short intervals. All 17 patients received fractionated radiotherapy to the thorax with a large irradiated lung volume. The CT findings were variable; pulmonary infiltrates were homogeneous, patchy, or discrete. CT abnormalities were evident in 15 of 17 cases within 16 weeks after radiotherapy; in 13 of these it was detected within 4 weeks. In three of these 15 cases, no abnormality was detected on chest radiographs, and in three other cases, the change was observed much later on chest radiographs than on CT scans. In the other nine cases, abnormalities were detected simultaneously on CT scans and chest radiographs. In four cases, extensive radiation pneumonitis was observed on CT, but in two of these, the change was misdiagnosed on the chest radiograph. We conclude that CT is useful in the detection of acute radiation-induced pulmonary disease.",Excluded

Aim/Introduction: To determine the value of systematically performing whole-body (head-to-toe) PET/CT images (WBPET) in the evaluation of patients with malignant melanoma and propose a criteria of when standard imaging can be performed. Material(s) and Method(s): Retrospective study of all WB-PET scans performed in patients with malignant melanoma in our hospital, either for staging, restaging, recurrence or post-treatment follow-up, between January 2011 and January 2020. We looked for any FDG avid foci in the lower extremities. The findings were considered as true positives if histopathological findings were confirmed, if the lesion was treated as melanoma because of other complementary findings (physical exploration, ultrasound, etc) or if during follow-up it was determined as malignant in nature. We also analyzed if the true positive findings had any change in patients management. Result(s): We analyzed 367 WB-PET studies belonging to 169 patients, 93 male (55%) and 76 female (45%), with a mean age of 56.4 years (range 19-90 years). Of the 367 studies performed 170 (46,3%) where for staging (all at least stage IIIB), and 197 (53,7%) for suspected recurrence or post treatment follow-up. From all the WB-PET scans we observed that 19 (5 %) had positive findings in the lower extremities, 11 (3%) of which were true-positive findings (all with histopathological confirmation), 8 (2%) scans were false positive (5 inflammatory foci demonstrated by clinical follow-up and 3 benign lesions (dermatophibroma, nevus and encondroma). From the 11 true-positive findings, 8 (2%) had the primary lesion in an infra-umbilical location; 1 (0.2%) was an extracutaneous melanoma (paranasal) but the finding could be included on a standard study, and the other 2(0,4%), had disseminated disease so the findings did not change clinical management. Also, none of these findings generated a change in management. Conclusion(s): In our cohort, we found that WB-PET in patients with melanoma had no additional value to standard (head-tomid-thigh) PET/CT images. We propose to perform WB-PET only in patients with the primary melanoma lesion located below the umbilical line. PET/CT acquisition of the lower extremities results in increased scan time and unnecessary radiation dose without generated therapeutic impact.",Excluded

Urine volume and radioactivity were measured before and after acquisition. Bladder activity was evaluated qualitatively and quantitatively., RESULTS: Radioactivity in the bladder was lower and the image quality higher in the furosemide group. SUV values showed a median of 3.0 in the furosemide and 6.0 in the control group. With furosemide, a larger excreted volume was seen compared to the control group. The furosemide group showed a significantly higher ratio of excreted/ injected radioactivity early after injection. However, the totally excreted radioactivity was not significantly different (p = 0.93)., CONCLUSION: Diuretics cause a higher urine volume with a diluted FDG concentration leading to an improved image quality. Furosemide accelerates early renal FDG elimination, reducing radiation exposure.",Excluded
1257,"Pharyngocutaneous fistula after salvage laryngectomy: IMPACT of interval between radiotherapy and surgery, and performance of bilateral neck dissection Background Pharyngocutaneous fistula is a serious complication of total laryngectomy. The purpose of this study was to examine predisposing factors at our institution. Methods We conducted a retrospective review of 94 consecutive patients undergoing total laryngectomy. Cases with hypopharyngeal primary tumors or undergoing extended hypopharyngeal resection with flap augmentation of the pharynx were excluded. Results Seventy-four cases met inclusion criteria. A total of 25.7% patients developed a pharyngocutaneous fistula. The fistula rate was higher after salvage laryngectomy than after primary surgery (34.0% vs 11.1%; p =.05). Among salvage laryngectomies, performance of laryngectomy within 1 year of completion of radiotherapy (p =.006) and performance of concomitant bilateral neck dissection (p =.02) were significant risk factors for development of a fistula. Radiation dose, addition of chemotherapy, use of pectoralis major myofascial flap, preoperative tracheostomy, primary puncture, primary tumor subsite, and initial T classification were not significant.

3493,"Prior exposure to medical and dental x-rays related to tumors of the parotid gland Findings from this population-based study in Los Angeles County suggest, for the first time, that tumors of the parotid gland are related to prior exposure to diagnostic medical and dental radiography. Responses to interviews with 408 patients with a parotid tumor (269 benign tumors and 139 malignant tumors) were compared to responses of 408 neighborhood controls. Cumulative exposure of the parotid gland from diagnostic radiography was associated with a dose-related increase in risk of malignant tumors (P for trend less than .05; relative risk for exposure to greater than or equal to 50 rad = 3.4; 95% confidence interval = 1.02-11.46). Benign tumors showed a weaker positive association, and exposure before age 20 to a major diagnostic examination (full-mouth or panoramic dental radiography or medical radiography to the head) increased risk (relative risk = 1.8; confidence interval = 1.13-2.91). This study also confirmed the association of malignant tumors with prior radiation treatment to the head or neck; 28% of these tumors are attributable to exposure of the parotid gland from diagnostic and therapeutic radiation.",Included

3192,"Exposure to electromagnetic fields and risk of central nervous system disease in utility workers Occupational exposure to electromagnetic fields has been associated with neurological diseases such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, senile dementia, Parkinson disease, and Alzheimer disease. I studied the incidence of central nervous system diseases in 30,631 persons employed in Danish utility companies between 1900 and 1993. I linked the cohort to the nationwide, population-based Danish National Register of Patients and compared the numbers of cases of these diseases observed between 1978 and 1993 with the corresponding rates in the general population. In addition I fit to the data on utility workers a multiplicative Poisson regression model in relation to estimated levels of exposure to 50-Hz electromagnetic fields. Overall, there was an increase in risk for senile dementia and motor neuron diseases combined. The incidences of Parkinson disease, Alzheimer disease, and other diseases of the central nervous system were essentially unrelated to exposure to electromagnetic fields. A decreased risk of epilepsy compared with the general population probably reflects a healthy worker effect; I observed an increased risk of epilepsy based on internal comparisons. The increased risk for senile dementia and motorneuron diseases may be associated with above-average levels of exposure to electromagnetic fields.",Excluded

2649,"Type of interventional pain procedure, body weight, and presence of spinal pathology are determinants of the level of radiation exposure for fluoroscopically guided pain procedures In the recent years new technology has led to the development of a bewildering array of imaging procedures. Yet, conventional radiography remains one of the most used tools to diagnose and to aid procedural interventions. Fluoroscopy guidance facilitates targeted drug delivery or radiofrequency directly to the area of pathology, a benefit that has to be balanced against the risks of radiation exposure. In this prospective observational survey of routine practice, dose area product (DAP) and screening time (ST) were recorded in 127 consecutive patients undergoing fluoroscopically guided spinal procedures along with other probable measures of potentially greater radiation exposure such as weight, type of spinal pathology, the ease of recognition of the anatomical landmarks, and the radiographic quality of the image in terms of contrast and graininess. The mean ST was 34+/-27 seconds (range, 3 to 218 seconds), the mean DAP was 1.18+/-1.08 Gy cm(2) (range, 0.023 to 6.82 seconds). A correlation between weight and DAP was confirmed (r=0.230, P<0.05, Spearman's correlation coefficient). Patients with spinal pathology (n=33) had higher radiation exposure than those without (DAP median=0.85, U=978.00, P<0.005, r=-0.28, Mann-Whitney test). The DAP values obtained compare favourably with the recommended doses for radiographs and other procedures, although they generally exceed the values for a chest X-ray. Copyright © 2011 The Authors.

1896,"Effect of intraoperative three-dimensional imaging during the reduction and fixation of displaced calcaneal fractures on articular congruence and implant fixation Background: Operative treatment of displaced calcaneal fractures should restore joint congruence, but conventional fluoroscopy is unable to fully visualize the subtalar joint. We questioned whether intraoperative 3-dimensional (3D) imaging would aid in the reduction of calcaneal fractures, resulting in improved articular congruence and implant positioning. Method(s): Sixty-two displaced calcaneal fractures were operated on using standard fluoroscopic views. When the surgeon had achieved a satisfactory reduction, an intraoperative 3D scan was conducted, malreductions or implant imperfections were revised, the calcaneus was rescanned, and this sequence was repeated until the optimal operative result was achieved. Result(s): Five fractures underwent 1 intraoperative scan, 39 fractures underwent 2 scans, 13 fractures underwent 3 scans, and 5 fractures underwent 4 scans. The average number of scans was 2.3. Intraoperative scanning led to re-reduction and improvement of reduction in 13 fractures, change of plate position in 1 patient, optimizing of the screw directions in 5 fractures, and shortening of screws that were intra-articular or protruding medially in 6 fractures. The postoperative articular displacement was 0 mm in 69% of the Sanders type 2 fractures and 57% of the Sanders type 3 fractures. Operation duration averaged 118 minutes, and there were no reoperations due to misplaced screws or plates. The average absorbed radiation dose per patient was 288 mGy*cm. Conclusion(s): Intraoperative 3D imaging improved the articular reduction of the posterior facet and secured optimal implant position in displaced calcaneal fractures. Radiation dose to the patient was less than that of a normal foot computed tomography scan. Level of Evidence: Level IV, case series.Copyright © 2015 The Author(s).",Excluded

From January 2016 to December 2017, 598 IOC examinations were performed. This study included 324 intraoperative cholangiographies performed with c-arm equipment not exceeding 10 years of age. When residents performed the procedures, the mean kerma area product (KAP) was 0.36 (standard deviation [SD] 0.70) Gycm 2 and in specialist surgeons group 0.36 (SD 0.47) Gycm2, P = 0.47. In residents group, the mean FT was 11.4 (SD 10.1) seconds and in specialist surgeons group, 9.2 (SD 11.9) seconds, P < 0.01. Linear regression analysis showed association between increased KAP-values and the presence of common bile duct (CBD) stones and body mass index (BMI). Age, BMI, laparoscopic surgery, acute cholecystitis, presence of CBD stones, resident surgeon performing IOC and ASA III-IV were associated with higher FT. National diagnostic reference level for IOC has not been introduced in Finland so far. Our mean KAP values (0.36 Gycm2) were 3-4 times lower and FT (10.1 seconds) were 3-5 times lower than the few reported in the literature. Routine use of IOC during cholecystectomy results in relatively low-radiation dose performed either by residents or specialist surgeons, irrespective of whether CBD stones were visualized or not.Copyright © The Author(s) 2019.

855,"Physicochemical properties of calcific deposits isolated from porcine bioprosthetic heart valves removed from patients following 2-13 years function The purpose of this study was to characterize the physicochemical properties of calcific deposits that cause the failure of tissue-derived heart valve bioprostheses. This was done in an effort to understand the mechanism of pathologic biomineralization in the cardiovascular system and potentially prevent deterioration of bioprostheses. Calcific deposits taken from 10 failed bioprosthetic valves that had been implanted in patients for 2-13 years were characterized by chemical analysis, x-ray diffraction, FTIR spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy, polarized light microscopy, and solubility measurements. The combined results identified the biomineral as an apatitic calcium phosphate salt with substantial incorporation of sodium, magnesium and carbonate. The average Ca/PO4 ratio for this young"" pathologic biomineral was approximately 1.3, considerably lower than approximately 1.7 found in mature atherosclerotic plaque biomineral and mature skeletal biomineral, both of which approximate hydroxyapatite in composition. Deproteinated calcific deposits from bioprostheses had thermodynamic solubilities comparable to those of both atherosclerotic plaque, typical pathologic biomineral and hydrolyzed octacalcium phosphate (OCP, Ca4H(PO4)3 x 2.5 H2O), a proposed precursor phase to biomineral apatite. This later finding, together with chemical composition and structural details of the bioprosthetic deposits themselves, supports a mechanism of cardiovascular calcification in which OCP plays a crucial role in the formation of the final apatitic phase. This suggests an approach toward prevention of bioprosthetic tissue calcification through control of the formation of the kinetically favored OCP precursor and/or its transformation into bioapatite.""",Excluded

We investigated the safety of CT angiography (CTA) in a predialysis cohort for evaluation of arterial and venous disease and other pathology that would alter management. Material(s) and Method(s): We reviewed the records of 40 potential renal transplant recipients (24 men and 16 women; age range, 23-79 years) who were investigated with CTA performed on 64-row MDCT scanners after 100 mL Iodixanol 320 (Visipaque, GE Healthcare, Princeton, NJ) IV contrast enhancement. Nonenhanced, arterial, and 2- minute delayed phase thin section (0.625-mm collimation) imaging was performed with 2-mm axial and multiplanar reconstruction, maximum intensity projection, and volume rendering angiographic reconstructions. Pre- and post-CTA serum creatinine (Se Cr) levels were obtained and clinical status observed to time of transplant or up to 7 months post- CTA. Patients underwent pre- and post-CTA hydration as allowed by individual renal status. Result(s): All patients had diagnostic quality CTA studies. Sixteen patients (40%) had major aortoiliac arterial disease that influenced transplantation management or required additional therapy. Eight patients had renal tumors, polycystic kidneys, or other tumors requiring surgical therapy. CTA necessitated additional imaging tests in seven others. Mean pre- and posttransplant Se Cr were 5.2 (range, 2.9-14.1) and 5.1 (range, 2.4-14.2) respectively. Twenty-seven patients had stable or mean decreased Se Cr of 10.2% and 13 had mean increase of 6.3% (range, +/- 32%) post-CTA. No patient required dialysis as a result of CTA. Conclusion(s): CTA with a moderate dose of Iodixanol contrast is a safe and effective procedure with no major clinical impact on renal function in this predialysis population.

Method(s): In a patient-based investigation lasting 6 months, 104 patients (mean age 64.6 years) on an interdisciplinary surgical intensive care unit were analyzed over 309 hospital occupancy days. Demographic data, drugs administered, infusions, nutrition, blood and coagulation products, invasive measures and monitoring, artificial respiration parameters, other measures and diagnostic services (laboratory, microbiology, x-ray, etc.), as well as four intensive scores (SAPS II, APACHE II, SOFA, TISS 28) were recorded daily. Result(s): The overall cost of 309 occupancy days (n=104) amounted to 457,564.11 euros, the average cost per day being 1,480.78 euros, and the mean case-specific cost 4,747.48 euros. 49 % of the overall cost was generated by medical staff, with medication and material each accounting for 18 %. Of the personnel costs, 70 % were caused by the nursing staff, 22 % by the medical staff and 8 % by cleaning and other personnel. During the course of hospitalisation, an non-significant increase in the costs generated by personnel was observed. A linear correlation was found between cumulated TISS 28 and the mean case costs. While there was no significant relationship between patient-specific score levels and individual case cost, the correlation between length of stay (LOS) and case cost was highly significant. Conclusion(s): The determining factor in the cost calculation of intensive care medicine are personnel costs. Overall cost is determined largely by the LOS, with such additional factors as age, diagnosis, comorbidity, etc. playing only an insignificant role. © Anasth Intensivmed 2010.",Excluded

The novel tSS was utilized to quantify targeted-PCI complexity., METHODS: We studied 420 consecutive patients who had PCI in our hospital. Two investigators independently measured tSS using the SYNTAX scoring algorithm. Patients were divided into three BMI (kg/m(2) ) subgroups: <25 (normal), 25-30 (overweight), and >30 (obese); and tSS tertiles: <5.5 (simple), 5.5-9 (moderate), and >9 (complex)., RESULTS: Obese patients were significantly younger and likely to have diabetes mellitus (DM). tSS positively correlated with RD for both genders, with median RD significantly higher in males (P < 0.0001). tSS correlated with RD in all three BMI subgroups (all P < 0.0001). Multivariate linear regression showed RD can be predicted by the formula: RD = -898 + 18 tSS + 49 BMI + 142 DM + 207 male., CONCLUSIONS: We report that tSS is a quantitative index of ""target-lesion"" PCI complexity, which is easy to measure with good reproducibility. tSS significantly and independently correlates with RD, although the strength of the association is less than for other predictors of RD (gender, diabetes, and BMI). tSS may be used to determine the RD from PCI and enhance patient risk-stratification when formulating a PCI strategy.

74,"The Impact of Dose Rate on DNA Double-Strand Break Formation and Repair in Human Lymphocytes Exposed to Fast Neutron Irradiation The lack of information on how biological systems respond to low-dose and low dose-rate exposures makes it difficult to accurately assess the carcinogenic risks. This is of critical importance to space radiation, which remains a serious concern for long-term manned space exploration. In this study, the gamma-H2AX foci assay was used to follow DNA double-strand break (DSB) induction and repair following exposure to neutron irradiation, which is produced as secondary radiation in the space environment. Human lymphocytes were exposed to high dose-rate (HDR: 0.400 Gy/min) and low dose-rate (LDR: 0.015 Gy/min) p(66)/Be(40) neutrons. DNA DSB induction was investigated 30 min post exposure to neutron doses ranging from 0.125 to 2 Gy. Repair kinetics was studied at different time points after a 1 Gy neutron dose. Our results indicated that gamma-H2AX foci formation was 40% higher at HDR exposure compared to LDR exposure. The maximum gamma-H2AX foci levels decreased gradually to 1.65 +/- 0.64 foci/cell (LDR) and 1.29 +/- 0.45 (HDR) at 24 h postirradiation, remaining significantly higher than background levels. This illustrates a significant effect of dose rate on neutron-induced DNA damage. While no significant difference was observed in residual DNA damage after 24 h, the DSB repair half-life of LDR exposure was slower than that of HDR exposure. The results give a first indication that the dose rate should be taken into account for cancer risk estimations related to neutrons.",Included
1353,"Kypho-IORT: Intraoperative radiotherapy in spinal metastases: Nine-month clinical results BACKGROUND CONTEXT: A new technique of combined kyphoplasty and intraoperative radiation therapy (Kypho-IORT) was introduced in 2010 [1]. The indication, rationale and possible advantages have been published in 2011 [2]. In the first clinical period several technical improvements and modifications could stabilize the method, its clinical feasibility and shortterm safety has been shown [3]. Due to the higher local radiation doses compared to extracorporal radiotherapy (EBRT) permitted by the steep dose fall off of the IORT-source a higher local tumor control can potentially be achieved by Kypho-IORT. In this study we present an intermediate prospective follow-up of 9-month after Kypho-IORT. PURPOSE: Local tumor control and clinical use of Kypho-IORT. STUDY DESIGN/SETTING: Evidence level IV: prospective case series. PATIENT SAMPLE: 62 patients suffering from 77 spinal metastases which were treated with Kypho-IORT were included in the prospective study. Data of 16 patients who finished the 4th follow-up appointment after around 9 months and were interpreted. OUTCOME MEASURES: Acquired basic data were gender, age at surgery, tumor entity, treated vertebral level, delivered dose. Prospective collected data were pain measure by visual analogue scale (VAS) preoperative and at follow-up, Karnofsky Index, local metastasis control in the treated vertebra and general progression of metastases by CT or MRI. METHOD(S): Clinical and radiographic follow-up examinations. RESULT(S): 16 patients (12 females, 4 males) with an average age of 61 years were included. Twelve patients had breast cancer, two patients suffered prostate cancer and one each with lung, ovarian and sigmoid cancer. Thirteen thoracic and 4 lumbar vertebrae were treated with an average surgical time of 70 minutes per vertebra. The time from surgery to the 9-month follow-up was in average 348 days. The Karnofsky index was constant with 87 preoperative versus 86 at follow-up. The VAS average decreased from 4.1 preoperative to 1.4 postoperative and 0.8 at follow-up. In all cases but two, a dose of 8gy in a radius of 5mm was delivered successfully, two cases with second dose level at 8gy in 8mm distance to isocenter. Three patients had a local progress, one patient due to incorrect indication. Two vertebrae needed open revision surgery; one local progress was treated only with EBRT. Eight patients showed a general tumor progress. CONCLUSION(S): Kypho-IORT can offer a fast postoperative pain reduction, immediate stabilization and prevention of secondary fractures in the treated vertebrae by kyphoplasty which could be confirmed in this small cohort. The VAS decreased postoperative and this level was maintained during follow-up. Local tumor control (indication failures ignored) by intraoperative radiation could be achieved in 87% of the vertebrae over the 9 months period, which seems to be better than single fraction radiation schedules and at least comparable to multiple fraction schedules of conventional radiation. Furthermore the Karnofsky-Index stayed constant over the follow-up period which proves the low morbidity of the intervention in short and in intermediate term. All 14 of 16 patients of the 9-month-follow- up were treated with the lowest calculated treatment dose; probably an even higher local tumor control is achievable by higher local radiation doses.These results warrant further evaluation of this technique by a dose escalation and a multicenter study, which is currently under way.",Excluded
1425,"CT in necrotizing soft tissue infection: diagnostic criteria and comparison with LRINEC score Objective: To investigate which computed tomography (CT) criteria are most useful in diagnosing necrotizing soft tissue infection (NSTI) and how CT performs with respect to the Laboratory Risk Indicator for Necrotizing Fasciitis (LRINEC) score. Method(s): Patients who underwent CT for suspected NSTI were eligible for inclusion. LRINEC score was assessed. CT scans were evaluated for subcutaneous edema, fluid along superficial fascia, fluid along deep fascia, blurring of intermuscular fat planes, fluid collection, and air in the soft tissues. Surgical findings or clinical follow-up served as reference standard. Result(s): Fourteen patients with NSTI and 34 patients with non-NSTI were included. LRINEC score was significantly higher in patients with NSTI (median of 7.5 vs. 6, p = 0.039). Fluid along the deep fascia was significantly more frequently present in patients with NSTI (46.2% vs. 5.9%, p = 0.001). In multiple logistic regression analysis, presence of fluid along the deep fascia was significantly associated with NSTI (odds ratio [OR] = 10.28, 95% CI: 1.57 to 67.18, p = 0.015), whereas the LRINEC score was not significantly associated with NSTI (OR = 1.27, 95% CI: 0.92 to 1.74, p = 0.146). Using presence of fluid along the deep fascia as diagnostic criterion for NSTI, sensitivity was 46.2% (95% CI, 23.2 to 70.9%) and specificity was 94.1% (95% CI, 80.9 to 98.4%). Conclusion(s): Fluid along the deep fascia was the only CT criterion which was significantly associated with NSTI and appeared more useful than the LRINEC score. In the right clinical setting, presence of this CT finding is highly suggestive for NSTI. Its absence, however, does not rule out NSTI. Key Points: * The presence of fluid along the deep fascia at CT is highly suggestive for NSTI in suspected patients. Its absence, however, does not rule out NSTI. `* The use of fluid along the deep fascia as a criterion appears to be more useful than the LRINEC score in diagnosing NSTI.Copyright © 2021, European Society of Radiology.",Excluded
1872,"Dose-response of critical structures in the posterior eye segment to hypofractioned stereotactic photon radiotherapy of choroidal melanoma PURPOSE: To identify modifying factors and dose-/volume-response relationships for the retina and optic nerve related to highly conformal hypofractionated radiotherapy., PATIENTS AND METHODS: Seventy-three patients undergoing hypofractionated stereotactic photon radiotherapy of choroidal melanoma were included in this retrospective study. The volumes of the optic nerve receiving doses of more than 7.5 or 12 Gy, respectively, were defined. Optic nerve circumference included in the 30%, 40%, 50%, or 80% isodose (ON%) and retina included in 30% or 40% were determined as quantal effects. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed for clinical variables as well as probit analysis to define EDx (doses where a positive response is expected in x% of the cases)., RESULTS: Median follow-up was 90.0 (interquartile range 69.0-98.0) months. Fifty-two (71%) and 49 (67%) patients developed radiation retinopathy and optic neuropathy (any grade). Age, length of follow-up and diabetes were significant parameters regarding retinopathy. Optic neuropathy was significantly influenced by age, length of follow-up, and ON30. The probability of optic neuropathy (any grade and grade >= 2) significantly increases with the dose (p ranges from 0.0126 to 0.0211)., CONCLUSION: Treatment planning should aim at minimizing encompassing isodoses particularly in the low dose region, without compromising PTV coverage.

2964,"Stereotactic Ablative Radiotherapy for the Management of Liver Metastases from Neuroendocrine Neoplasms: A Preliminary Study INTRODUCTION: Liver metastases are common in patients with neuroendocrine neoplasms. The role of stereotactic ablative radiotherapy (SABR) is not well understood in this population. OBJECTIVE(S): To evaluate the safety and efficacy of SABR in treating well-differentiated neuroendocrine liver metastases (WD-NELM). METHOD(S): A retrospective review of patients with WD-NELM treated with SABR between January 2015-July 2019. Demographic, treatment and clinical/radiographic follow-up data were abstracted. RECIST 1.1 criteria were applied to each individual target to evaluate the response to treatment. Local control (LC) and progression free survival (PFS) were determined using Kaplan-Meier methodology. Toxicity was reported according to CTCAE v5.0. RESULT(S): Twenty-five patients with a total of 53 liver metastases treated with SABR were identified. Most patients (68%) had midgut tumors, were Grade II (80%) and had high volume intrahepatic and/or extrahepatic disease (76%). Median number of liver metastases treated was 2 with a median size of 2.5 cm. Median radiation dose delivered was 50Gy/5 fractions. Median follow-up was 14 months; 24 of the 25 patients were alive at time of analysis. The objective response rate (ORR) was 32%, with improvement or stability in 96% of lesions treated. The median time to best response was 9 months. The 1-year LC and PFS were 92% and 44% respectively. No Grade III/IV acute or late toxicity was identified. CONCLUSION(S): Liver SABR is a safe and promising means of providing local control for WD-NELM. This treatment modality should be evaluated in select patients in concert with strategies to manage systemic disease.Copyright © 2021 S. Karger AG, Basel.",Excluded

3450,"Efficacy of narrowband UVB vs. PUVA in patients with early-stage mycosis fungoides INTRODUCTION: Mycosis fungoides (MF) is a non-Hodgkin's T-cell lymphoma of the skin that often begins as limited patches and plaques with slow progression to systemic involvement. Narrowband ultraviolet (UV) B therapy has been proven to be an effective short-term treatment modality for clearing patch-stage MF. The effect of psoralen plus long-wave ultraviolet A (PUVA) in the treatment of patch- and plaque-type MF has also been thoroughly documented., OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this study was to compare the efficacy and safety of narrowband UVB and PUVA in patients with early-stage MF., METHODS: We analysed the response to treatment, relapse-free survival and irradiation dose in 114 patients with histologically confirmed early-stage MF (stage IA, IB and IIA)., RESULTS: A total of 95 patients were treated with PUVA (83.3%) and 19 with narrowband UVB (16.7%). With PUVA, 59 patients (62.1%) had a complete response (CR), 24 (25.3%) had a partial response (PR) and 12 (12.6%) had a failed response. Narrowband UVB led to CR in 12 (68.4%) patients, PR in 5 (26.3%) patients and a failed response in 1 (5.3%) patient. There were no differences in terms of time to relapse between patients treated with PUVA and those treated with narrowband UVB (11.5 vs. 14.0 months respectively; P = 0.816). No major adverse reactions were attributed to the treatment., CONCLUSIONS: Our results confirm that phototherapy is a safe, effective and well-tolerated, first-line therapy in patients with early-stage cutaneous T-cell lymphoma, with prolonged disease-free remissions being achieved. It suggests that narrowband UVB is at least as effective as PUVA for treatment of early-stage MF.",Excluded
2430,"Skin cancer risk perception and sun protection behavior at work, at leisure, and on sun holidays: A survey for Danish outdoor and indoor workers 11 Medical and Health Sciences 1117 Public Health and Health Services Background: To prevent occupational skin cancer, it is essential that the sun-protective behavior of outdoor workers is adequate. The aim is to study the sun-protective behavior of Danish outdoor workers at work, at leisure, and on sun holiday and compare it to that of indoor workers. Method(s): This is a cross-sectional study, based on a 53-item survey completed by Danish outdoor (n = 380) and indoor workers (n = 119) in 2016-2017. Status as outdoor or indoor worker was decided based on self-report and behavioral differences were tested using (paired) t tests and multiple regression adjusted for age, sex, educational level, history of smoking, and skin type. Result(s): Danish outdoor workers at work use sun protection less than they do at leisure and on sun holiday (alpha <.05) where their sun protection behavior is similar to that of indoor workers. The proportion of Danish outdoor workers that always/often use sun protection at work is for shade seeking around noon 4.2%, sunscreen 34.5%, wide-brimmed hat 25.3%, and long trousers and shirt with sleeves 42.4%. Of Danish outdoor workers, 49.5% do not think about the risk of occupational skin cancer and 11.8% think the risk is insignificant, 32.4% think that the use of sun protection is of low or no importance, 84.2% consider sunburn important as skin cancer risk factor still 88.9% have a history of sunburn at work, > 80.0% agree that risk of skin cancer is reduced by the use of sun protection, and only 4.0% dismiss the possibility of sun protection use at work. Conclusion(s): Skin cancer risk and use of sun protection at work are largely neglected in Danish outdoor workers, more so than at leisure and on sun holiday where their risk behavior resembles that of indoor workers. This indicates an untapped workplace preventive potential.Copyright © 2018 The Author(s).",Excluded
2940,"Laboratory longevity and competitiveness of Dacus ciliatus Loew (Diptera: Tephritidae) following sub-sterilizing gamma irradiation The effect of a sub-sterilizing gamma radiation dose on Dacus ciliatus adults was investigated to assess the suitability of the sterile insect technique (SIT) as an alternative method to control this pest. Late pupae (48 h prior to adult emergence) from a laboratory strain were irradiated with 120 Gy of gamma rays emitted by a 60Co source. Following adult emergence, the mortality of irradiated and non-irradiated cohorts was recorded. Over a period of 50 days after emergence, no significant negative effects of irradiation upon the longevity of male or female laboratory flies were observed. A laboratory competitiveness study (Fried test), using irradiated laboratory and wild males at a ratio of 3:1 was conducted to assess the ability of irradiated males to reduce the egg hatch rates of a wild population. The overall competitiveness was found to be ca. 0.32, suggesting a reduced, but satisfactory, quality of irradiated laboratory as compared with wild males. Based on the above findings, we calculated and proposed effective male release ratios for field application of SIT against D. ciliatus.",Excluded
2838,"Physiological, behavioral, and serological responses of horses to shaded or unshaded pens in a hot, sunny environment Housing recommendations for horses invariably include providing access to shade on hot, sunny days, but the potential benefits have not been scientifically studied. This experiment measured physiological, behavioral, and serological responses of horses confined individually to completely shaded (SH) or completely unshaded (SUN) drylot pens during the summer in Davis, CA. Twelve healthy adult horses in a crossover design experienced both treatments for 5 d each. Rectal temperature, respiration rate, skin temperature, and sweat scores were recorded hourly from 1230 to 1730 h daily. Observations were recorded from 1200 to 1800 h for proximity to water, foraging, locomotion, and insect avoidance behaviors. Daily blood samples were obtained to measure cortisol, hematocrit, and neutrophil- to-lymphocyte ratio. Automated and handheld sensors were used to record environmental conditions. The mean ambient temperature from 1200 to 1800 h during the study was 30.6degreeC. Rectal temperature was greater for horses in SUN than for SH (mean 37.8degreeC and 37.5degreeC, respectively, SE = 0.06, P = 0.002) as was respiration rate (25.5 and 20.5 breaths/min, SE = 1.3, P = 0.008), and skin temperature (35.6degreeC and 34.6degreeC, SE = 0.1, P < 0.001). Horses in SUN showed sweat in 51.4% of observations vs. 1.1% for horses in SH. Horses in SUN spent more time than SH horses standing near their water source (34.0% of observations vs. 20.2%, SE = 0.3, P = 0.004). No differences were observed for foraging, locomotion, or insect avoidance behavior (P > 0.05). Cortisol concentrations were greater in SUN than SH (3.4 and 2.6 mug/dL, respectively, P < 0.001) but remained within the normal range for resting horses. No treatment differences were observed for hematocrit or neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (P > 0.05). Horses exhibited treatment differences in the physiological measures first, most notably in rectal temperature at 1230 h, corresponding to peak solar radiation. Behavioral responses followed these physiological changes, with treatment differences in time standing near water becoming apparent at 1400 h as ambient and black globe temperature increased. Our results indicate that both the SH and SUN treatment groups exhibited thermoregulatory responses to these summer conditions and horses benefited from shade, as it mitigated these physiological and behavioral changes. These results are applicable in developing best management practices for the care of domestic horses. © 2013 American Society of Animal Science. All rights reserved.",Excluded
590,"Upregulation of VEGF and FGF2 in normal rat brain after experimental intraoperative radiation therapy The expression of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and fibroblast growth factor (FGF)2 in the irradiated brain was examined to test how a single high dose radiation, similar to that used for intraoperative radiation therapy given to the normal cerebrum, can affect the vascular endothelium. After a burr hole trephination in the rat skull, the cerebral hemisphere was exposed to a single 10 Gy dose of gamma rays, and the radiation effect was assessed at 1, 2, 4, 6, and 8 weeks after irradiation. Histological changes, such as reactive gliosis, inflammation, vascular proliferation and necrosis, were correlated with the duration after irradiation. Significant VEGF and FGF2 expression in the 2- and 8-week were detected by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay quantification in the radiation group. Immunohistochemical study for VEGF was done and the number of positive cells gradually increased over time, compared with the sham operation group. In conclusion, the radiation injuries consisted of radiation necrosis associated with the expression of VEGF and FGF2. These findings indicate that VEGF and FGF2 may play a role in the radiation injuries after intraoperative single high-dose irradiation.",Included
177,"Effect of irradiation, asbestos and chemical cocarcinogens on incidence of sarcoma on implants An implant can act as a physical carcinogen. Chemicals applied to its surface can augment that. To explore if cocarcinogenesis would affect the incidence of tumour on implants, we tested several physical (asbestos, beta irradiation) and chemical (acridine orange, phorbol methyl ester, cigarette smoke tar, extract of Agaricus bisporus mushroom) carcinogens on 25 mm diameter nitrocellulose filters implanted in groups of BALB/c mice in 9 experiments. Saline was applied in 287 concurrent controls. Irradiation by 540 kBq I-125 fibrinogen on foreign bodies of surface area 20sq cm induced tumour in 6/6 pilot animals (expected 2/6) and in 25/36 animals (controls 13/29; p < 0.04). The mean dose (beta and gamma) to cells within 20 mum of the filter surface was estimated to be 782 mGy. Exposures to 270kBq or less were not significantly cocarcinogenic with single implants. Radiation from the paired implants was detectible up to 80 weeks. Asbestos, however, 2.3 or 4.6 mgm on implants did not in 3 trials increase sarcoma yield significantly, but did induce mesothelial-type growths in the peritoneum. Asbestos (2.3 mg) injected without an implant provoked no tumour at the site. The chemical carcinogen acridine orange gave ambiguous results, and the others reduced tumour incidence insignificantly. The irradiation history may be germane in the human cases that arise.",Excluded
1,"Modifying Effect of Chronic Atrophic Gastritis on Radiation Risk for Noncardia Gastric Cancer According to Histological Type The findings from previously published studies have suggested that radiation exposure is associated with increased mortality and incidence of gastric cancer. However, few cohort studies have incorporated risk factors such as Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) infection or chronic atrophic gastritis (CAG). The current study is aimed at evaluating the modifying effect of CAG on radiation risk of noncardia gastric cancer by histological type, by reanalyzing data from a nested case-control study conducted within the longitudinal clinical cohort of atomic bomb survivors. The analysis was restricted to 297 intestinal- or diffuse-type noncardia cases and 873 controls rematched to the cases on gender, age, city, and time and type of serum storage, and countermatched on radiation dose. Multivariable-adjusted relative risks [95% confidence interval (CI)] of noncardia gastric cancer were 3.9 (2.1-7.2) for H. pylori IgG seropositivity with cytotoxin-associated gene A (CagA) IgG low titer, 2.6 (1.9-3.6) for CAG, 1.9 (1.3-2.8) for current smoking, and 1.4 (1.1-1.9) for 1 Gy irradiation. Among subjects without CAG, the relative risk (95% CI) of noncardia gastric cancer at 1 Gy was 2.3 (1.4-3.7), whereas relative risk (95% CI) at 1 Gy was 1.1 (0.8-1.5) among subjects with CAG (for the overall interaction, P = 0.012). By histological type, the risk at 1 Gy was high for diffuse type without CAG, with adjusted relative risk (95% CI) of 3.8 (2.0-7.6), but was not high for diffuse type with CAG or for intestinal-type irrespective of CAG status. The results indicate that radiation exposure is associated with increased risk of diffuse-type noncardia gastric cancer without CAG, and this association exists despite adjustment for H. pylori infection and smoking habit.

The corneal stroma was soaked with 0.22% riboflavin for 90 seconds before flap repositioning. One eye was then randomized to receive either 18 mW/cm of ultraviolet A irradiation for 120 seconds or for 180 seconds, whereas the fellow eye received the other irradiation duration. The demarcation line on anterior-segment optical coherence tomography and grading of corneal haze on slit lamp were compared at postoperative month 1., RESULTS: The average age was 29.0 +/- 8.2 years. There was no statistical difference in preoperative spherical equivalent refraction (P > 0.05). At postoperative 1 month, a well-defined demarcation line was visible in 74% and 70% in the 2- and 3-minute groups, respectively. The demarcation line depth was 282 +/- 51 mum and 284 +/- 43 mum, respectively (P = 1), and the ratio of the demarcation line depth to the postoperative central corneal thickness was 0.69 +/- 0.13 and 0.72 +/- 0.10 (P = 0.61). There was no difference in the percentage of eyes with grade 1 or 2 corneal haze (P = 0.76)., CONCLUSIONS: The depth of the demarcation line was the same after receiving 18-mW/cm irradiation for either 2 or 3 minutes. The amount of early postoperative corneal haze was also similar. We postulate that there was lack of oxygen in the corneal tissue to fuel the photochemical reaction despite given additional time.",Excluded

Recently, the role of NF-E2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) in enhancing chemoradiation sensitivity has been reported in several types of cancers. Here, we investigated whether temozolomide (TMZ) and irradiation (IR) combined treatment induced Nrf2 activation in human glioblastoma cells. And we further performed a preliminary study about the effect of Nrf2 on chemoradiation sensitivity. Immunohistochemical staining for Nrf2 in paired clinical specimens showed that TMZ and IR combined treatment increased the expression and nuclear localization of Nrf2 in human glioblastoma tissues. Moreover, we found nuclear Nrf2 expression in the glioblastoma tissues obtained from the patients undergoing TMZ and IR combined treatment was associated with the time to tumor recurrence. In vitro, we further verified these findings. First, we detected increased nuclear localization of Nrf2 following treatment with TMZ+IR in human glioblastoma cell lines. Second, we demonstrated TMZ+IR increased the levels of Nrf2 protein in both nuclear and cytoplasmic fractions of U251 cells and induced Nrf2 target genes expression. Finally, downregulating Nrf2 expression increased TMZ+IR-induced cell death in the U251 cells. These findings suggest TMZ+IR combined treatment induces Nrf2 activation in human glioblastoma cells. The activation of Nrf2 may be associate with enhancing chemoradiation sensitivity in human glioblastoma cell. Blocking Nrf2 activation may be a promising method enhancing chemoradiation sensitivity of glioblastoma cells.",Excluded

We prospectively investigated the effect of proton pump inhibitors (PPI) supplemented with UDCA in vivo in patients with BE. Patients with no or low-grade dysplasia who were clinically asymptomatic on PPI were eligible for the study. In order to exclude the effects of acid reflux, all patients were initially treated with 40 mg esomeprazole (ESO) twice daily for 6 months and continued on this dose till the end of the study (t = 12 months). During a period of 6 months (t = 6 month - t = 12 month) patients were treated with oral UDCA (600 mg twice daily). Patients underwent endoscopy at t = 0 months, t = 6 months and t = 12 months with multiple biopsies of the distal and proximal BE segment, normal squamous and gastric cardia. In addition, pH was measured at t = 0 months and t = 6 months using a BRAVO wireless pH capsule. Bile was sampled at the beginning of the UDCA treatment and 6 months later (t = 6 month and t = 12 month). All biopsies were reviewed for the extent of metaplasia, dysplasia, and acute and chronic inflammation. In addition, proliferation (Ki67), differentiation (villin, cytokeratins 7 and 20) and inflammation (COX-2) were investigated by immunohistochemistry (IHC). Nine patients (mean age 60 years, median BE length 7 cm) were included, of whom six had no dysplasia and three had low-grade dysplasia. pH measurements revealed a normal acid exposure in most patients at t = 0 and t = 6 months. In addition, bile composition analysis demonstrated the efficacy of UDCA. Combining the results of both phases of the study, no significant changes were seen in any of the histological or IHC parameters. Differentiation and proliferation parameters showed no significant changes. In this study, in BE patients who were clinically asymptomatic on PPI, increasing the PPI dose to the maximum for 6 months followed by the addition of UDCA for 6 months did not result in significant histological or IHC changes in their BE.",Excluded
2585,"Solid cancer mortality associated with chronic external radiation exposure at the french atomic energy commission and nuclear fuel company Studies of nuclear workers make it possible to directly quantify the risks associated with ionizing radiation exposure at low doses and low dose rates. Studies of the CEA (Commissariat l'Energie Atomique) and AREVA Nuclear Cycle (AREVA NC) cohort, currently the most informative such group in France, describe the long-term risk to nuclear workers associated with external exposure. Our aim is to assess the risk of mortality from solid cancers among CEA and AREVA NC nuclear workers and its association with external radiation exposure. Standardized mortality ratios (SMRs) were calculated and internal Poisson regressions were conducted, controlling for the main confounding factors sex, attained age, calendar period, company and socioeconomic status (SES). During the period 19682004, there were 2,035 solid cancers among the 36,769 CEA-AREVA NC workers. Cumulative external radiation exposure was assessed for the period 19502004, and the mean cumulative dose was 12.1 mSv. Mortality rates for all causes and all solid cancers were both significantly lower in this cohort than in the general population. A significant excess of deaths from pleural cancer, not associated with cumulative external dose, was observed, probably due to past asbestos exposure. We observed a significant excess of melanoma, also unassociated with dose. Although cumulative external dose was not associated with mortality from all solid cancers, the central estimated excess relative risk (ERR) per Sv of 0.46 for solid cancer mortality was higher than the 0.26 calculated for male Hiroshima and Nagasaki A-bomb survivors 50 years or older and exposed at the age of 30 years or older. The modification of our results after stratification for SES demonstrates the importance of this characteristic in occupational studies, because it makes it possible to take class-based lifestyle differences into account, at least partly. These results show the great potential of a further joint international study of nuclear workers, which should improve knowledge about the risks associated with chronic low doses and provide useful risk estimates for radiation protection. © 2011 by Radiation Research Society.",Included
1011,"Cetuximab plus cisplatin, irinotecan, and thoracic radiotherapy as definitive treatment for locally advanced, unresectable esophageal cancer: A phase-II study of the SWOG (S0414) Introduction: The specific aims of the study were to evaluate the 2-year overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS), toxicity profile, and best objective response rate in patients with locally advanced, clinically unresectable esophageal cancer receiving cetuximab, cisplatin, irinotecan, and thoracic radiotherapy (TRT) within a multi-institutional cooperative-group setting. Method(s): Eligible patients (cT4 M0 or medically unresectable, biopsy proven, and noncervical esophageal cancer) were to receive four 21-day cycles of cetuximab 400 mg/m2 (day 1, cycle 1), cetuximab 250 mg/m2 (day 8, 15, cycle 1; then days 1, 8, and 15 for subsequent cycles), cisplatin 30 mg/m2 (days 1 and 8, all cycles), and irinotecan 65 mg/m 2 (days 1 and 8, all cycles). TRT was administered at 1.8 Gy in 28 daily fractions to a total dose of 50.4 Gy, to begin with on day 1 of cycle 3. The primary endpoint was 2-year OS, with an accrual goal of 75 patients with adenocarcinoma. Result(s): The study was closed because of slow accrual, with 21 eligible patients (11 squamous, 10 adenocarcinoma) enrolled from May 2005 to September 2007. Two-year OS and PFS (95% confidence interval [CI]) were 33.3% (14.6-57.0%) and 23.8% (8.2-47.2%), respectively. Kaplan-Meier estimates of median (95% CI) OS and PFS were 11.2 (6.4-43.6) and 6.4 (3.7-12.0) months, respectively. The overall response rate (95% CI) among 17 evaluable patients was 17.6% (3.8-43.4%), including 6% confirmed complete responders and 12% unconfirmed partial responders. Two deaths resulted from protocol treatment (sudden death and gastrointestinal necrosis). Ten (47.6%) and 6 (28.6%) patients had grade-3 or -4 toxicity, respectively: 52.4% were hematologic, 23.8% had fatigue, 19.0% had nausea, 19.0% had dehydration, and 19.0% had anorexia. Conclusion(s): Concomitant cetuximab, cisplatin, irinotecan, and TRT were poorly tolerated in the first North American cooperative group trial testing this regimen for locally advanced esophageal cancer as treatment-related mortality approached 10%. Single-institution phase-II cetuximab-based combined modality trials have yielded encouraging results in preliminary analyses.

1008,"Cytogenetic and molecular characterization of plutonium-induced rat osteosarcomas The association between ionizing radiation and the subsequent development of osteosarcoma has been well described, but little is known about the cytogenetic and molecular events, which could be involved in the formation of radiation-induced osteosarcomas. Here, we performed comparative genomic hybridization (CGH) to detect chromosomal copy number changes in a series of 16 rat osteosarcomas induced by injection of plutonium-238. Recurrent gains/amplifications were observed at chromosomal regions 3p12-q12, 3q41-qter, 4q41-qter, 6q12-q16, 7q22-q34, 8q11-q23, 9q11-q22, 10q32.1-qter, and 12q, whereas recurrent losses were observed at 1p, 1q, 3q23-q35, 5q21-q33, 8q24-q31, 10q22-q25, 15p, 15q, and 18q. The gained region at 7q22-q34 was homologous to human chromosome bands 12q13-q15/8q24/22q11-q13, including the loci of Mdm2, Cdk4, c-Myc and Pdgf-b genes. The lost regions at 5q21-q33, 10q22-q25 and 15q contained tumor suppressor genes such as p16INK4a/p19ARF, Tp53 and Rb1. To identify potential target gene(s) for the chromosomal aberrations, we compared the expression levels of several candidate genes, located within the regions of frequent chromosomal aberrations, between the tumors and normal osteoblasts by using quantitative RT-PCR analysis. The Cdk4, c-Myc, Pdgf-b and p57KIP2 genes were thought to be possible target genes for the frequent chromosomal gain at 7q22-34 and loss at 1q in the tumors, respectively. In addition, mutations of the Tp53 gene were found in 27% (4 of 15) osteosarcomas. Our data may contribute to further understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying osteosarcomas induced by ionizing radiation in human.",Excluded

Material(s) and Method(s): Fifty-seven elderly patients with postoperative local recurrence of rectal carcinoma were randomly divided into a clinical group and a control group. The clinical group had 31 patients, who received 6 Mv X-ray 3DCRT, 2 Gy per time, 5 times every week. After radiotherapy for the total pelvis until target dose (DT) in tumor focus reached 40 Gy/20f, the tumor focus was intensified up to DT 60-64 Gy with 8 Mv X-ray DT 20-24 Gy. During radiotherapy, the patients were treated with XELOX (oxaliplatin 85 mg/m2, dl, Xeloda 850 mg/m2, p.o. d1-14) for two periods. The control group had 26 pa tients, who were only treated with XELOX. Result(s): The responder rate (RR) of the clinical group was 87.1%. The survival rates within 1, 2 and 3 years were 67.7%, 51.6% and 41.9% respectively, which were higher than the control group (p < 0.05). However, the clinical group had significantly more 1st and 2nd degree myelosuppression and hand-foot syndrome. The symptoms were relieved after symptomatic treatment. Conclusion(s): Concurrent 3DCRT and XELOX treatment for postoperative local recurrence of rectal carcinoma in the elderly patients greatly improved short-term efficacy and survival rate within 1, 2 and 3 years, while the toxic effects also increased greatly, but could be withstood by most patients.",Excluded
1413,"A Comparative Evaluation of 3 Different Free-Form Deformable Image Registration and Contour Propagation Methods for Head and Neck MRI: The Case of Parotid Changes During Radiotherapy Purpose: To validate and compare the deformable image registration and parotid contour propagation process for head and neck magnetic resonance imaging in patients treated with radiotherapy using 3 different approaches-the commercial MIM, the open-source Elastix software, and an optimized version of it. Material(s) and Method(s): Twelve patients with head and neck cancer previously treated with radiotherapy were considered. Deformable image registration and parotid contour propagation were evaluated by considering the magnetic resonance images acquired before and after the end of the treatment. Deformable image registration, based on free-form deformation method, and contour propagation available on MIM were compared to Elastix. Two different contour propagation approaches were implemented for Elastix software, a conventional one (DIR_Trx) and an optimized homemade version, based on mesh deformation (DIR_Mesh). The accuracy of these 3 approaches was estimated by comparing propagated to manual contours in terms of average symmetric distance, maximum symmetric distance, Dice similarity coefficient, sensitivity, and inclusiveness. Result(s): A good agreement was generally found between the manual contours and the propagated ones, without differences among the 3 methods; in few critical cases with complex deformations, DIR_Mesh proved to be more accurate, having the lowest values of average symmetric distance and maximum symmetric distance and the highest value of Dice similarity coefficient, although nonsignificant. The average propagation errors with respect to the reference contours are lower than the voxel diagonal (2 mm), and Dice similarity coefficient is around 0.8 for all 3 methods. Conclusion(s): The 3 free-form deformation approaches were not significantly different in terms of deformable image registration accuracy and can be safely adopted for the registration and parotid contour propagation during radiotherapy on magnetic resonance imaging. More optimized approaches (as DIR_Mesh) could be preferable for critical deformations.Copyright © 2017, © The Author(s) 2017.",Excluded
2138,"Expression changes of ERK1/2, STAT3 and SHP-2 in bone marrow cells from gamma-ray induced leukemia mice The aim is to clarify expression changes of ERK1/2, STAT3 and SHP-2 in bone marrow cells from gamma-ray induced leukemia mice. A mouse model of gamma-ray induced leukemia was produced, and by means of quantitative real-time PCR, immunoprecipitation, Western blotting and electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSA), the expression of mRNA and protein, phosphorylation level, and protein activity of ERK1/2, STAT3 and SHP-2 in bone marrow cells were investigated in these mice. The results indicated that mRNA and protein expressions of ERK1/2 were upregulated, with significant increase of phosphorylation level and protein activity, but with insignificant differences in mRNA and protein expressions, phosphorylation level and protein activity of STAT3 and SHP-2 in bone marrow cells from gamma-ray induced leukemia mice compared to the radiation/tumor-free or control mice. It is concluded that in the pathogenesis of gamma-ray induced leukemia in Balb/C mice, activated ERK1/2 pathway may play a role, without involving STAT3 pathway; meanwhile, SHP-2 exerts no regulative effect on pathways of Ras-ERK1/2 and JAK-STAT.",Included
1404,"Incidence of Breast Cancer in the Life Span Study of Atomic Bomb Survivors: 1958-2009 The importance of reproductive history in breast tissue development and etiology of sporadic breast cancer in females is well established. However, there is limited evidence of factors, other than age, that modify risk of radiation-related breast cancer. In this study, we evaluated breast cancer incidence in the Life Span Study cohort of atomic bomb survivors, adding 11 years of follow-up and incorporating reproductive history data. We used Poisson regression models to describe radiation risks and modifying effects of age and reproductive factors. Among 62,534 females, we identified 1,470 breast cancers between 1958 and 2009. Of 397 new cases diagnosed since 1998, 75% were exposed before age 20. We found a strong linear dose response with excess relative risk (ERR) of 1.12 per Gy [95% confidence interval (CI): 0.73 to 1.59] for females at age 70 after exposure at age 30. The ERR decreased with increasing attained age ( P = 0.007) while excess absolute rate (EAR) increased with attained age up to age 70 ( P < 0.001). Age at menarche was a strong modifier of the radiation effect: for a given dose, both the ERR and EAR decreased with increasing age at menarche ( P = 0.007 and P < 0.001). Also, independently, age-at-exposure effects on ERR and EAR differed before and after menarche ( P = 0.043 and P = 0.015, respectively, relative to log-linear trends), with highest risks for exposures around menarche. Despite the small number of male breast cancers (n = 10), the data continue to suggest a dose response (ERR per Gy = 5.7; 95% CI: 0.3 to 30.8; P = 0.018). Persistently increased risk of female breast cancer after radiation exposure and its modification pattern suggests heightened breast sensitivity during puberty.",Excluded
3222,"Ultrasonic delivery of silica-gold nanoshells for photothermolysis of sebaceous glands in humans: Nanotechnology from the bench to clinic Recent advances in nanotechnology have provided numerous opportunities to transform medical therapies for the treatment of diseases including cancer, atherosclerosis, and thrombosis. Here, we report, through in vitro studies and in vivo human pilot clinical studies, the use of inert, inorganic silica-gold nanoshells for the treatment of a widely prevalent and researched, yet poorly treated disease of acne. We use ~ 150 nm silica-gold nanoshells, tuned to absorb near-IR light and near-IR laser irradiation to thermally disrupt overactive sebaceous glands in the skin which define the etiology of acne-related problems. Low-frequency ultrasound was used to facilitate deep glandular penetration of the nanoshells. Upon delivery of the nanoshells into the follicles and glands, followed by wiping of superficial nanoshells from skin surface and exposure of skin to near-infrared laser, nanoshells localized in the follicles absorb light, get heated, and induce focal thermolysis of sebaceous glands. Pilot human clinical studies confirmed the efficacy of ultrasonically-delivered silica-gold nanoshells in inducing photothermal disruption of sebaceous glands without damaging collateral skin.Copyright © 2015 Elsevier B.V.",Excluded

2436,"Impact of Vessel Suppressed-CT on Diagnostic Accuracy in Detection of Pulmonary Metastasis and Reading Time Rationale and Objectives: To assess if vessel suppression (VS) improves nodule detection rate, interreader agreement, and reduces reading time in oncologic chest computed tomography (CT). Material(s) and Method(s): One-hundred consecutive oncologic patients (65 male; median age 60y) who underwent contrast-enhanced chest CT were retrospectively included. For all exams, additional VS series (ClearRead CT, Riverrain Technologies, Miamisburg) were reconstructed. Two groups of three radiologists each with matched experience were defined. Each group evaluated the SD-CT as well as VS-CT. Each reader marked the presence, size, and position of pulmonary nodules and documented reading time. In addition, for the VS-CT the presence of false positive nodules had to be stated. Cohen's Kappa (k) was used to calculate the interreader-agreement between groups. Reading time was compared using paired t test. Result(s): Nodule detection rate was significantly higher in VS-CT compared to the SD-CT (+21%; p <0.001). Interreader-agreement was higher in the VS-CT (k = 0.431, moderate agreement) compared to SD-CT (k = 0.209, fair agreement). Almost all VS-CT series had false positive findings (97-99 out of 100). Average reading time was significantly shorter in the VS-CT compared to the SD-CT (154 +/- 134vs. 194 +/- 126; 21%, p<0.001). Conclusion(s): Vessel suppression increases nodule detection rate, improves interreader agreement, and reduces reading time in chest CT of oncologic patients. Due to false positive results a consensus reading with the SD-CT is essential.Copyright © 2020 The Association of University Radiologists",Excluded
1932,"Cumulative ionizing radiation to image the small bowel: Are we really exceeding the safety limits? Introduction: Radiation exposure from diagnostic imaging of the small bowel is common in Crohn's disease (CD) patients. Increased risk of malignancy has been associated with radiation exposure. For solid cancers this follows a linear-no-threshold model. Current data (BEIR VII) demonstrates that exposure to 100mGY to population of mixed ages, the life time attributable risk (LAR) of solid organ malignancy is 8 per 1000 of exposed persons for males and 13.1 per 1000 for females. This varies according to age of exposure exposure to 100mGY at age 10 confers a risk of 1.33% for males (2.53% for females); at age 30 this is 0.6% for males (1% for females) and at age 50 it is 0.51% for males (0.68% for females). 100mGY exposure confers a LAR (in a linear-quadratic model) for leukaemia of 1 per 1000 for males and 0.72 per 1000 for females. This varies from 1.2 per 1000 exposed males at age 10 (0.86 for females) to 0.84 per 1000 males exposed at age 30 (0.49 for females). The risk remains the same for males aged 50 and decreases to 0.30 per 1000 females exposed aged 50. Aim and Method: Aim: To determine the cumulative ionizing radiation exposure in mGY secondary to non-acute small bowel (SB) imaging in CD patients. Method(s): Patients were identified from our database. Their SB investigations were extracted. Radiation exposure for the procedures was obtained from the Physics division of the radiology department. Result(s): 80 CD patients (males 42 patient) were identified. The time since the diagnosis of CD varied from 41 years to 5 months (mean 8.6 years). 56 patients (30 males) were exposed to ionizing radiation to image the SB. Table 1 denotes the total number of exposures per age group and gender. 15 male and 5 female patients had SB stricturing disease. 2 female patients had fistulising SB disease. Table 2 demonstrates cumulative ionizing radiation secondary to non-acute small bowel imaging. Conclusion(s): 70% of the CD patients were exposed to diagnostic ionizing radiation as to image the small bowel. This radiation exposure reached more than 50mGY in 15% of patients and more than 100mGY in 8.75% our Study group. These results demonstrate the high ionizing radiation with the possible consequences that CD patients are exposed to throughout their lifetime. Thus we suggest that efforts should be done to image the small bowel by non-ionizing radiation such as MRI. In places where this is not available the request for ionizing radiation should only be done by specialists in close liason with the radiologists. (Table presented).",Excluded
3490,"Differential radio-adaptive responses in BALB/c and C57BL/6 mice: pivotal role of calcium and nitric oxide signalling Purpose: Our earlier studies demonstrated that transient radio-adaptive responses (RAR) in BALB/c mice were due to MAPK hyperactivation. The objective of this study was to determine the time duration of this low dose induced MAPK activation in BALB/c mice and to find out if similar adaptive responses are observed in C57BL/6 mice. Materials and methods: Mice were irradiated with 0.1 Gy priming dose (PD), 2 Gy challenge dose (CD) with an interval of 4 h (P + CD) and radiation induced immunosuppression in splenic lymphocytes was monitored as the endpoint for RAR. Results: Time kinetics following 0.1 Gy demonstrated persistence of MAPK hyperactivation till 48 h. Similar experiments in C57BL/6 mice indicated absence of RAR at 24 h following CD, in spite of MAPK activation which was also confirmed by time kinetics. Therefore, upstream activators of MAPK, viz., reactive oxygen and nitrogen species (ROS, RNS) and calcium levels were estimated. There was increased intracellular calcium (Ca2+) and nitric oxide (NO) in BALB/c and an increase in intracellular ROS in C57BL/6 mice 24 h after PD. Inhibition of NO and calcium chelation abrogated RAR in BALB/c mice. In vitro treatment of spleen cells with combination of NO donor and Ca2+ ionophore mimicked the effect of PD and induced adaptive response after 2 Gy not only in BALB/c but also in C57BL/6 mice confirming their crucial role in RAR. Conclusions: These results suggest that low dose induced differential induction of Ca2+ and NO signaling along with MAPK was responsible for contrasting RAR with respect to immune system of BALB/c and C57BL/6 mice.

A previously validated noise-insertion tool was used to simulate reduced-dose scans at 75%, 50%, 25%, and 10% of the original dose at four representative phases of the cryoablation procedure. Images obtained at different dose levels were randomized and reviewed by three radiologists blinded to the level of dose reduction, who scored them independently with a 5-point scale (1-5, with 5 the best). Images with a mean score of 3 or higher were considered diagnostically acceptable. The minimal acceptable dose was that at which 90% of images were considered diagnostically acceptable. Interrater agreement was assessed using the weighted kappa statistic., RESULTS: The weighted kappa value was 0.68, indicating substantial agreement among the reviewers. The averaged percentage of diagnostically acceptable images for the four series was 100% for a full dose, 98-100% for the 75% dose level, 94-98% for the 50% dose level, and less than 90% for images obtained at the 25% and 10% dose levels, which was considered unacceptable., CONCLUSION: On the basis of results from 15 patients (17 procedures), images obtained from CT acquisitions at 50% (volume CT dose index, 12.2 mGy) of the original dose level (volume CT dose index, 24.4 mGy) were acceptable for the purpose of CT monitoring of renal cryoablation procedures.",Excluded
1521,"Fragility fracture and osteoarthritis: Interaction between bone mineral and bone mass index Increased bone mineral density (BMD) and bone mass index (BMI) are associate with increased risk of osteoarthritis (OA) and reduced risk of fragility fracture. However, little is known about the relationship between fragility fracture and osteoarthritis. In this study, we sought to examine the interactions between BMD and BMI in the determination of the OA-fracture relationship. The study was part of the on-going Dubbo Osteoporosis Epidemiology Study, which involved 2,412 women and 1,452 men aged between 46 to 99 years. The individuals had been followed up for a median of 7 years (range: 0.1 to 21 years). Baseline BMD was measured at femoral neck (FNBMD) and lumbar spine (LSBMD) by dual energy X-ray absorptiometry (GE-Lunar, Madison, WI). Osteoarthritis was ascertained by self-report. The incidence of fragility fracture was ascertained by X-ray report during the follow-up period. In addition, data concerning demographic characteristics, clinical history, and lifestyle factors were obtained by a structured questionnaire. A total of 1,077 participants (691 women and 386 men) had reported a diagnosis of OA. Overall, the risk of OA was associated significantly with increased LSBMD in men (odds ratio [OR] 1.34, 95%CI, 1.19-1.52) and women (1.20; 1.09-1.32). Elevation in FNBMD was significantly associated with increased risk of OA in men (OR 1.16; 1.02-1.32), but not in women. When stratified by BMI, significant association remained between OA risk and high LSBMD amongst women with BMI < 25kg/m2 (OR 1.26; 1.07-1.47) and BMI >30kg/m2 (1.26; 1.05-1.51); and in men with BMI < 25kg/m2 (OR 1.75; 1.37-2.27) or BMI 25-30kg/m2 (1.21; 1.02-1.43). OA was associated with an increased risk of fracture. After adjusting for LSBMD women with OA had significant increased fracture risk (1.41; 1.16-1.72); however, the association was not significant in men (OR 0.96; 0.69-1.32). Moreover, the association between OA and fracture risk was particularly pronounced in women with BMI 25-30kg/m2 (OR 1.45; 1.05-1.99, adjusted for LSBMD).These data suggest that high BMD is associated with a greater risk of OA in both men and women, particularly those with low BMI. The results also suggest that BMD could be a useful measure for identifying individuals at high risk of OA, particularly among those at lower BMI spectrum. Despite having higher bone density, women with self-reported OA, especially those overweight, have an increased risk of fragility fracture, suggesting that the OA-fracture association is mediated via non-BMD factors.",Excluded
2613,"High dose rate brachytherapy in the management of lung transplant airway stenosis BACKGROUND: Airway complications after lung transplantation remain a major cause of postoperative morbidity and mortality. Interventional bronchoscopic management continues to be the main modality in the management of these problems., METHODS: Four patients with airway stenoses after lung transplantation received high dose rate brachytherapy for management of recurrent stenosis. All 4 patients had been treated with various bronchoscopic interventions, including dilation and stenting, electrocautery ablation, and neodymium:yttrium-aluminum-garnet laser therapy. High dose rate endobronchial brachytherapy was subsequently used in all 4 patients for management of recurrent airway obstruction. The radiation dose for all 4 patients was 3 Gy at a distance of 1 cm from the center of the catheter., RESULTS: All four patients have had routine follow-up after endobronchial brachytherapy treatments. Of the 4 patients, 2 treated with this modality showed a significant response to therapy in that the bronchus remained free of obstruction after treatment; 1 patient had partial improvement, and 1 patient failed to show significant improvement and expired from the sequelae of persistent airway obstruction., CONCLUSIONS: Endobronchial brachytherapy can be an effective modality for managing recurrent stenoses caused by hyperplastic granulation tissue at the bronchial anastomosis. The optimal timing and ideal candidate for intraluminal radiation therapy for this problem remains a challenge and warrants further investigation.",Excluded

663,"Staff radiation dose and estimated risk in an interventional radiology department In interventional radiology attendant staff can be exposed to significant doses from the radiation scattered from the patient, giving rise to heterogeneous energy distribution, exposure occurring over extended periods of time. Protection of staff is a prime concern, also including reducing the risk of carcinogenesis. With only limited published studies available, as in for instance in regard to lens opacifications, further evaluation of staff exposures and assessment of radiation protection techniques and measures are crucial. Present study has sought to evaluate staff radiation exposure in a radiology department that performs interventional procedures. Annual occupational exposures were obtained for 32 personnel (6 females and 26 males) in a radiology department at a tertiary hospital. Personal dose equivalent Hp (d) was measured in terms of Hp (0.07) (shallow dose) and Hp (10) (deep dose). The measurements were made over a period of two consecutive years, 2017 and 2018, use being made of TLD-100 thermoluminescent dosimeters. In units of mSv, the corresponding average annual dose equivalent and range for Hp (10) and Hp (0.07) were 4.6 +/- 7.0 (0.1-25.5) and 5.1 +/- 7.3 (0.1-25.5). Notably, 16% of staff received doses that were greater than the annual dose limit. Since Hp (10) offers a conservative evaluation of effective dose, evaluation of the working environment is necessary in seeking to ensure dose values remain below annual dose limits.Copyright © 2020 Elsevier Ltd",Excluded

The primary study endpoint was contrast volume. Secondary endpoints included fluoroscopy time, procedure time, patient and operator radiation exposure, vascular complications, and major adverse cardiac events. Analyses were by intention-to-treat., RESULTS: Compared with femoral access, diagnostic coronary angiography via radial access was associated with a higher mean contrast volume (142 +/- 39 ml vs. 171 +/- 72 ml, p < 0.01), longer procedure time (21.9 +/- 6.8 min vs. 34.2 +/- 14.7 min, p < 0.01), greater patient air kerma (kinetic energy released per unit mass) radiation exposure (1.08 +/- 0.54 Gy vs. 1.29 +/- 0.67 Gy, p = 0.06), and higher operator radiation dose (first operator: 1.3 +/- 1.0 mrem vs. 2.6 +/- 1.7 mrem, p < 0.01; second operator 0.8 +/- 1.1 mrem vs. 1.8 +/- 2.1 mrem, p = 0.01).

BACKGROUND: Radiation-induced oesophagitis is a major side effect of concurrent chemotherapy and radiotherapy. A strong association between neutropenia and oesophagitis was previously shown, but external validation and further elucidation of the possible mechanisms are lacking., METHODS AND PATIENTS: A total of 119 patients were included at two institutions. The concurrent group comprised 34 SCLC patients treated with concurrent carboplatin and etoposide, and concurrent chest irradiation, and 36 NSCLC patients with concurrent cisplatin and etoposide, and concurrent radiotherapy, while the sequential group comprised 49 NSCLC patients received sequential cisplatin and gemcitabine, and radiotherapy., RESULTS: Severe neutropenia was very frequent during concurrent chemoradiation (grade: 4 41.4%) and during induction chemotherapy in sequentially treated patients (grade 4: 30.6%), but not during radiotherapy (only 4% grade 1).

There was no correlation between the occurrence of neutropenia during induction chemotherapy and acute oesophagitis during or after radiotherapy alone. In the univariate analysis, total radiation dose (p < 0.001), overall treatment time of radiotherapy (p < 0.001), mean oesophageal dose (p = 0.038) and neutropenia (p < 0.001) were significantly associated with the development of oesophagitis. In a multivariate analysis, only neutropenia remained significant (p = 0.023)., CONCLUSION: We confirm that neutropenia is independently correlated with oesophagitis in concurrent chemoradiation, but that the susceptibility for chemotherapy-induced neutropenia is not associated with radiation-induced oesophagitis. Further studies focusing on the underlying mechanisms are thus warranted.",Excluded

3225,"Solo sonographically guided PCNL under spinal anesthesia-results of 165 cases Aim: The well-known serious harms of radiation have encouraged surgeons to use it as low as necessary. Hence, sonography was brought in as an adjunct to X-Ray to restrict radiation exposure in PCNL. This study was designed to respond this question that is sonography proper enough to supersede X-Ray in PCNL? Methods: 165 consecutive cases were prospectively enrolled. All steps of access to the system, single shot tract dilatation and residue checking were performed solely under sonography guidance; i.e. without any usage of x-ray under spinal anesthesia. Decision to place a nephrostomy tube was made based on the surgeon's judgment on the system injury or bleeding. Result(s): male to female ratio was 5/3. Mean age was 46+/-15 years. Forty percent of kidneys showed hydronephrosis and 20 percent of stones were nonopaque. Mean stone burden was 504+/-350 mm2. Mean duration of surgery was 42+/-21 minutes. Stone free rate was 85% in patients with single pelvic stone and 75% in staghorn cases. Mean residual stone size was 15+/-9 mm. Admission time was 2 days on average. Fifteen percent of patients showed grade I or II complication and in six percent grade III complication occurred based on Clavien classification. There was no case organ injury or death. Complication rate was directly related to surgery duration. Conclusion(s): Sonographically guided PCNL is feasible with acceptable stone free rate and complication.",Excluded
1953,"Increased metabolic activity in the spinal cord of patients with long-standing Lhermitte's sign PURPOSE: To investigate the pathophysiology of the radiation-induced, chronic Lhermitte's sign (LS) on the basis of long-standing case histories with partial functional recovery., PATIENTS AND METHODS: As radiotherapy in two nasopharyngeal cancer patients, a biologically effective dose (BED) of 103.8 Gy(2) (case 1) and 94.8 Gy(2) (case 2) was delivered to the cervical spinal cord. Neurologic signs relating to the irradiated spinal cord segments developed after 2 months (case 1) and 5 years (case 2), with radiation-induced damage equivalent to grade 3 (case 1) and grade 2 (case 2) toxicity (Common Toxicity Criteria, Version 2.0). The clinical status improved to grade 2 (case 1) and grade 1 (case 2). Positron emission tomography (PET) and fibroblast clonogen assay were applied 25 and 7 years postirradiation, respectively, to characterize this rare clinical picture., RESULTS: PET demonstrated increased [(18)F]fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) accumulation and [(15)O]butanol perfusion, but negligible [(11)C]methionine uptake in the irradiated spinal cord segments in both patients. In clonogenic assays, fibroblasts from case 1 displayed much higher radiation sensitivity than in healthy controls, while in case 2 the fibroblasts sensitivity was normal., CONCLUSIONS: These data suggests a close direct relationship between regional perfusion and metabolism of the spinal cord, similarly as in the brain. The postirradiation recovery may be related to energy-demanding conduction, explaining the increased metabolism and perfusion. The increased radiosensitivity and higher spinal cord BED may have contributed to the more severe sequelae in case 1.",Excluded

Design Prospective observational case series. Subjects Eighty-nine patients seen by the UK Nationally Commissioned XP Service, from April 2010 to December 2014, with a genetically confirmed diagnosis of XP. Methods Patients underwent a full ophthalmic examination at each visit. Clinical features from both eyes were recorded on a standard proforma. The most recent assessments were analyzed. A 2-tailed Fisher exact test was used to assess for differences in ocular features between patients in XP subgroups with impaired transcription coupled nucleotide excision repair (TC-NER) (category 1: XP-A, B, D, F, and G) and preserved TC-NER (category 2: XP-C, E, and V). Main Outcome Measures Lid and periocular abnormalities, ocular surface pathologies, neuro-ophthalmologic abnormalities, lens and retinal abnormalities, and visual acuity (VA). Results Ninety-three percent of XP patients in our cohort had ocular involvement, with 65% describing photophobia. The most common abnormalities were in the periocular skin and ocular surface, including interpalpebral conjunctival melanosis (44%) and conjunctival injection (43%). Eleven percent of patients had required treatment for periocular cancers and 2% for ocular surface cancers. The most common neuro-ophthalmologic finding was minimal pupillary reaction to light (25%). Patients in category 2 had significantly more ocular surface abnormalities than patients in category 1, including a greater proportion of conjunctival injection (P = 0.003), conjunctival corkscrew vessels (P < 0.001), corneal scarring (P = 0.01) and pingueculae under the age of 50 (P = 0.02). Meanwhile, patients in category 1 had a higher proportion of poorly reactive pupils (P < 0.001) and abnormal ocular movements (P = 0.03) compared with those in category 2. Five patients (6%) presented to ophthalmologists with ocular surface signs related to XP, before any formal diagnosis of XP was made. Conclusions A large proportion of XP patients have ocular involvement. Regular examination by an ophthalmologist is essential, especially in screening for eyelid and ocular surface tumors. The ocular phenotype-genotype segregation within XP patients suggests that XP is a heterogeneous and complex disease. With further study, we hope to offer these patients more individualized patient care.Copyright © 2017 American Academy of Ophthalmology",Excluded
108,"Development of solid self-nanoemulsifying granules (SSNEGs) of ondansetron hydrochloride with enhanced bioavailability potential The current work aims to prepare the solid self-nanoemulsifying granules (SSNEGs) of ondansetron hydrochloride (ONH) to enhance its oral bioavailability by improving its aqueous solubility and facilitating its absorption though lymphatic pathways. Preformulation studies including screening of excipients for solubility and pseudoternary phase diagrams suggested the suitability of Capmul MCM as lipid, Labrasol as surfactant, and Tween 20 as cosurfactant for preparation of self-emulsifying formulations. Preliminary composition of the SNEDDS formulations were selected from the phase diagrams and subjected to thermodynamic stability studies and dispersibility tests. The prepared liquid SNEDDS formulations were characterized for viscosity, refractive index, droplet size and zeta potential. The TEM study confirmed the formation of nanoemulsion following dilution of liquid SNEDDS. The optimized liquid SNEDDS were transformed into free flowing granules by adsorption on the porous carriers like Sylysia (350, 550, and 730) and Neusilin TM US2. Solid state characterization employing the FTIR, DSC and powder XRD studies indicated lack of any significant interaction of drug with the lipidic and emulsifying excipients, and porous carriers. In vitro drug release studies indicated faster solubilization of the drug by optimized SSNEGs (over 80% within 30 min) vis-a-vis the pure drug (only 35% within 30 min). In vivo pharmacokinetic studies in Wistar rats observed significant increase in C(max) (3.01-fold) and AUC (5.34-fold) using SSNEGs compared to pure drug, whereas no significant difference (p>0.1) was observed with the liquid SNEDDS. Thus, the present studies ratify the bioavailability enhancement potential of SSNEGs of ONH prepared using porous carriers. Copyright © 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",Excluded
140,"Translocation Frequency in Patients with Repeated CT Exposure: Comparison with CT-Naive Patients Epidemiologic studies using clinical indicators are limited in the assessment of the biological effects of low-dose ionizing radiation for medical purposes. We evaluated the biological effect of low-dose radiation by comparing translocation frequencies in patients with repeated computed tomography (CT) exposure and CT-naive patients. The goal of this prospective case-control study was to determine whether repeated CT exposure is associated with increased frequency in chromosomal translocations. Two cohorts, comprised of case patients with a history of repeated CT exposure and age- and sex-matched CT-naive control patients (n = 48 per cohort), were consecutively enrolled in this single-institution study. CT-radiation exposure was estimated using dose-length products, and translocation frequencies of peripheral blood lymphocytes were assessed using whole chromosome paints by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH). Comparison of translocation frequencies between cases and controls was performed using the Wilcoxon rank sum test (paired samples), and the relationship between cumulative radiation exposure and translocation frequency was assessed using a partial correlation analysis. Translocation frequencies were significantly different between cases and controls (P = 0.0003). The median translocation frequency was 7 [95% confidence interval (CI): 6, 8] for cases and 4 (95% CI: 3, 6) for controls. By using cumulative radiation exposure as the effect variable and translocation frequency as the response variable, we found a significant correlation between cumulative radiation exposure and translocation frequency (r = 0.6579, P < 0.0001). Chromosomal translocations were more frequent with repeated CT-exposed patients than in CT-naive patients, and a positive dose-response relationship was present between cumulative radiation exposure and translocation frequency.",Included
2376,"Radioprotective effect of sulfasalazine on mouse bone marrow chromosomes Sulfasalazine (SAZ), a prescribed drug for inflammatory bowel disease, is a potent scavenger of reactive oxygen species. The present study was undertaken to ascertain its ability to protect against gamma radiation-induced damage. Acute toxicity of the drug was studied taking 24-h, 72-h and 30-day mortality after a single intraperitoneal injection of 400-1200 mg/kg body weight (b.wt.) of the drug. The drug LD(50) for 24- and 72-h/30-day survival were found to be 933 and 676 mg/kg b.wt., respectively. The optimum time of drug administration and drug dose-dependent effect on in vivo radiation protection of bone marrow chromosomes was studied in mice. Injection of 30-180 mg/kg SAZ 30 min before gamma irradiation (RT) with 4 Gy produced a significant dose-dependent reduction in the RT-induced percent aberrant metaphases and in the frequency of micronucleated erythrocytes at 24 h after exposure, with a corresponding decrease in the different types of aberrations. The optimum dose for protection without drug toxicity was 120 mg/kg b.wt. At this dose, SAZ produced >60% reduction in the RT-induced percent aberrant metaphases and micronucleated erythrocytes. SAZ also produced a significant increase in the ratio of polychromatic erythrocytes to normochromatic erythrocytes from that of irradiated control. Injection of 120 mg/kg of the drug 60 or 30 min before or within 15 min after 4 Gy whole-body RT resulted in a significant decrease in the percent of aberrant metaphases and in the frequency of micronucleated erythrocytes at 24 h post-irradiation; the maximum effect was seen when the drug was administered 30 min before irradiation. These results show that SAZ protect mice against RT-induced chromosomal damage and cell cycle progression delay. SAZ also protected plasmid DNA (pGEM-7Zf) against Fenton's reactant-induced breaks, suggesting free radical scavenging as one of the possible mechanism for radiation protection.",Excluded

Median radiation dose was 70 Gy (range, 69.3-70.4 Gy) with daily fractionation ranging from 2 Gy to 2.2 Gy., RESULTS: When comparing 2 Gy versus >2 Gy daily fractionation, there was no difference in 2-year overall survival (71% vs 72%; p = .68), locoregional control (79% vs 77%; p = .43), or laryngectomy-free survival (60% vs 61%; p = .72). Use of 2 Gy versus >2 Gy fractionation improved laryngoesophageal dysfunction-free survival (2-year estimates, 49% vs 27%; p = .07). Patient-reported voice and swallowing were improved with the former., CONCLUSION: As the importance of a functional larynx becomes recognized as an endpoint for patients treated by voice preservation, the results of our study help refine treatment guidelines. © 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

3494,"Cytogenetic responses to G2 phase X-irradiation of cells from retinoblastoma patients Fibroblast cell lines from 20 retinoblastoma (RB) patients with the hereditary bilateral form of disease compared with 16 lines from normal donors had a significantly higher chromatid aberration frequency (CAF), and more displaced and nondisplaced breaks per 100 metaphase cells after x- irradiation during the G2 phase of the cell cycle. The mean CAF was 39 +/- 1.0, range 30-46, for cells from normal subjects, compared to a mean of 245.6, range 101-506, for cells from hereditary RB patients (p < 10-6). Of fibroblast lines from eight patients with unilateral RB, four had a CAF comparable to that of lines from normal donors (< 60) and four had a high CAF (> 130), resembling that of hereditary forms; two of the latter four lines were from patients with familial or deletion 13 forms of RB. Furthermore, in two families, PHA-stimulated blood lymphocytes from RB patients, one bilateral and one unilateral, and from certain unaffected first-degree relatives after G2 phase X-irradiation had a high CAF (>= 110) compared to a CAF (>= 53) of cells from three normal donors sampled at the same time. These results were shown not to be related to differences in cell cycle progression or initial extent of chromatid damage. The results suggest that the high frequency of chromatid aberrations in the cells from hereditary RB patients results from a genetic deficiency in DNA repair.",Included
2610,"Modifications of the cutaneous microrelief in the superficial radiation-induced fibrosis: Qualitative study Cutaneous radiation-induced fibrosis (RIF) is characterized by a skin retraction or atrophy, toughness to the palpation and often entails functional limitation. Its clinical evaluation remains poorly quantified. The aim of this study was to propose an analytical method to quantify RIF skin surface with the replica technique. In this preliminary study, we report the qualitative and quantitative evaluation of the cutaneous microrelief in 44 healthy controls and in four patients presenting a superficial RIF, 3 to 20 years after radiotherapy for cancer. The microrelief of these RIF presented an abnormal anisotropy with a parallel reorganization of cutaneous valleys in three cases out of four, suggesting a premature radiation-induced ageing of the skin. Each subject being his own control, the relative vertical amplitude of the skin microrelief was +/- 15% in control skin. Vertical amplitude was respectively increased by 84% in one inflammatory fibrosis (3 years after RT), decreased by 18% in one evolutive fibrosis (6 years after RT), decreased by 26% in one voluminous stabilized fibrosis (8 years after BT) and decreased by 53% in one atrophic fibrosis (20 years after BT). The present study suggests that the variations of the microrelief parameters could reflect the RIF evolution. This technique requires a validation in a larger series of patients, including patients with telangiectasia.",Excluded

Conventionally, the endpoints for head and neck cancer patients focused on objective tumor response, local control and overall survival. These endpoints are assessed from the physician's point of view.and in view of increased number of longtime survivors, the need for understanding patients experience, their perceptions of treatment effects and their priorities have to be well recognized, Hence a prospective study was conducted to evaluate the quality of life in Indian patients of locally advanced head and neck cancer patients undergoing concurrent chemo radiation. Method(s): Single arm prospective observational study of 53 patients receiving concurrent chemo-radiation were assessed for changes in quality of life using EORTC QLQ-C30 and the EORTC -H&N35 questionnaires at baseline before treatment , 4th week during treatment,on completion of treatment,4weeks and 12 weeks after treatment.Data analysis was done using paired t test for each variable comparing each of the assessments done during treatment, on completion of treatment, 1 month post completion of treatment and 3months post completion of treatment comparing with baseline values . Result(s): Mean age of the study population was 52.48 +/- 11.6 years (Age range 28-72 years).

Material(s) and Method(s): Medical records of 60 patients with NSCLC who received definitive CCRT were retrospectively reviewed. Dose volumetric (DV) parameters, clinical factors, and pulmonary function test (PFT) data were analyzed. RP was graded according to the CTCAE ver. 4.0. Percentage of lung volume that received a dose of threshold (Vdose) and mean lung dose (MLD) were analyzed for potential DV predictors. PFT changes were calculated as the difference between pre-RT and post-RT values at 3, 6, and 12 months after RT. Result(s): Twenty-two patients (37%) developed grade >=2 RP. Among clinical factors, tumor location in lower lobe was associated with RP. Among the DV parameters, only MLD >15 Gy was associated with grade >=2 RP. There were statistically significant decreases in PFT at all points compared with pre-RT values in grade >=2 RP group. MLD was associated with forced vital capacity (FVC) and forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) changes at 6 and 12 months. V10 was associated with FVC changes at 12 months. V20 and V30 were associated with FEV1 changes at 6 months and FVC changes at 12 months. Conclusion(s): After definitive CCRT in patients with NSCLC, MLD >15 Gy and lower lobe tumor location were predictors of grade >=2 RP.

Experiments here reported suggest that 2 consecutive total-body gamma-irradiations of 150 rads each are sufficient to induce in rats the development of tumors, some malignant; 18 of 19 females (94.7%) developed tumors at an average age of 11.4 mo, and seven of the 14 males in this group (50%) developed tumors at an average age of 10.4 mo. In the second group, which received 3 consecutive gamma-irradiations, 20 of 23 females (86.9%) and 5 of 13 males (38.4%) developed tumors at average ages of 9.1 and 7.5 mo, respectively.

The etiology of tumors either developing spontaneously or induced by irradiation in rats remains to be clarified. Our attempts to detect virus particles by electron microscopy in such tumors or lymphomas have not been successful.

We reviewed the experience of a single institution to determine the variables that affect treatment outcome. DESIGN AND SETTING: A retrospective review of patients with the diagnosis of intracranial germ cell tumors treated in a single institution (KFSHRC) during the period from March 1985 to December 2007. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Fifty-seven patients with the diagnosis of intracranial GCT were recorded in the KFSHRC Tumor Registry during the period from 1985 to 2007. Seven patients with a pineal region tumor treated as germinomas in the earlier years without a tissue diagnosis were excluded. This retrospective study was restricted to the remaining 50 patients with a tissue or marker diagnosis: 31 germinomas and 19 non-germinomatous germ cell tumors (NGGCTs). RESULT(S): The 10-year overall survival (OS), event-free survival (EFS) and relapse-free survival (RFS) were 87%, 88% and 96% for patients with germinoma, with a median follow-up of 4.5 (range 2-17) years, compared with 26%, 29% and 46% for patients with NGGCT with a median follow-up of 3 (range 1.5-13) years. For NGGCT, variables favorably influencing OS were younger age (< 16 y vs >=16 y, P=.01), higher radiation dose (>50 Gy vs <=50 Gy; P=.03) and later year of diagnosis (>1990 vs <1990 P=.002). CONCLUSION(S): Tissue diagnosis of GCTs is mandatory prior to treatment except for patients with elevated markers. In germinoma, localized radiotherapy (RT) for M0 patients may be adequate. Long-term follow-up is needed to define the benefit of adding chemotherapy. For NGGCT, the use of combined modality treatment and RT dose >50 Gy are important factors that influence the outcome.

The purpose of this study was to develop an accurate and reproducible measurement for glenoid inclination on standardized anterior-posterior (AP) radiographs and on computed tomography (CT) images. Material(s) and Method(s): Three consistently identifiable angles were defined: Angle alpha by line AB connecting the superior and inferior glenoid tubercle (glenoid fossa) and the line identifying the scapular spine; angle beta by line AB and the floor of the supraspinatus fossa; angle gamma by line AB and the lateral margin of the scapula. Experimental study: these 3 angles were measured in function of the scapular position to test their resistance to rotation. Conventional AP radiographs and CT scans were acquired in extension/flexion and internal/external rotation in a range up to +/-40degree. Clinical study: the inter-rater reliability of all angles was assessed on AP radiographs and CT scans of 60 patients (30 with proximal humeral fractures, 30 with osteoarthritis) by 2 independent observers. Result(s): The experimental study showed that angle alpha and beta have a resistance to rotation of up to +/-20degree. The deviation from neutral position was not more than +/-10degree. The results for the inter-rater reliability analyzed by Bland-Altman plots for the angle beta fracture group were (mean +/- standard deviation) -0.1 +/- 4.2 for radiographs and -0.3 +/- 3.3 for CT scans; and for the osteoarthritis group were -1.2 +/- 3.8 for radiographs and -3.0 +/- 3.6 for CT scans.

So, the aim of the study is to present the clinical, laboratory and demographic characteristics of patients with intradialytic hypertension in our dialysis center. Method(s): Of total 110 hemodialysis patients, 17 patients (15,45%) were intradialytic hypertensive - started at a systolic pressure greater than 140 mm Hg or had an increase in systolic pressure more than 10 mm Hg during the session, and 17 patients were normotensive or had a drop in blood pressure during the dialysis. HD were performed 3 times per week with a duration of 4-5 hours, on machines with controlled ultrafiltration and high flux syntetic membrane ( polyetersulfon) sterilized with gamma rays. It was used dialysate with standard electrolytes content (Na+ 138 mmol/L, K+ 2,0 mmol/L, Ca++ 1,5 mmol/L, Mg +1,0 mmol/L, CH3COO- 3,0 mmol/L, Cl -110 mmol/l, HCO3- 35 mmol/L). Analysed demographic and clinical characteristics were: gender, age, BMI, dialysis vintage, vascular acces, cardiovascular comorbidity (cardiomyopathy, ischemic cardiac disease, peripheral artery disease, heart valve disease), number and type of antihypertensive drugs, a weekly dose of erythropoesis - stimulating agent, standard monthly, three and six months laboratory analyzes, and sp Kt/V and PCR. Statistical analysis was performed with SPSS 17.0. Result(s): In the both groups were more men (IDH group 88,23%, control group 64,07%). IDH group was older (59,00+/- 7,64 versus 49.00+/- 13,91, p= 0,314) and with lower BMI (p = 0,246) compared to control group. Significantly lower serum sodium and higher sodium gradient had IDH patients (135,75+/-2,03 versus 137,33 +/-1,97, p= 0,042; 2,25+/-1,98 versus 0,66+/-1,44, p=0,0267, respestively).

Setting Hospital setting. Participants All patients undergoing a diagnostic CT examination between July 2013 and July 2018 at the Maastricht University Medical Center. Primary and secondary outcome measures The primary outcome was the probability of receiving a high effective dose, defined as >=100 mSv, from one or more CT examinations within 5 years as derived from a time-to-event analysis. Secondary outcomes were the clinical indication for the initial scan of patients receiving a high effective dose. Results 100 672 CT examinations were performed among 49 978 patients including 482 (1%) who received a high radiation dose. The estimated probability of a high effective dose from a single examination is low (0.002% (95% CI 0.00% to 0.01%)). The 4.5-year probability of receiving a high cumulative effective dose was 1.9% (95% CI 1.6% to 2.2%) for women and 1.5% (95% CI 1.3% to 1.7%) for men. The probability was highest in age categories between 51 and 74 years. A total of 2711 (5.5%) of patients underwent more than six CT examinations, and the probability of receiving a high effective dose was 16%. Among patients who received a high effective dose, most indications (80%) were oncology related. Conclusions The probability of receiving a high radiation dose from CT examinations is small but not negligible. In the majority (80%) of high effective dose receiving patients, the indication for the initial CT scan was oncology related.Copyright © Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2021.

145,"Effect of radioactive iodine therapy on salivary flow rates and oral Streptococcus mutans prevalence in patients with thyroid cancer Unstimulated and stimulated salivary flow rates, Streptococcus mutans samples, and dental caries data were obtained from 50 patients with thyroid cancer who had received radioactive iodine, I131, from 0.3 to 20 years earlier. The salivary flow rates were compared with a healthy control group, and the S. mutans counts were compared to a group of patients with head and neck cancer who were sampled before radiotherapy. Flow rates were found to be significantly lower in the patients with thyroid cancer, and S. mutans levels were slightly but not significantly higher than the controls. Longitudinal flow rate data taken on four patients, who served as their own controls before and after I131 therapy, indicated a trend in saliva reduction.",Included

1983,"Impact of an augmented reality navigation system (SIRIO) on bone percutaneous procedures: A comparative analysis with standard CT-guided technique (1) Background: The purpose of this study is to evaluate the impact of an augmented reality navigation system (SIRIO) for percutaneous biopsies and ablative treatments on bone lesions, compared to a standard CT-guided technique. (2) Methods: Bioptic and ablative procedures on bone lesions were retrospectively analyzed. All procedures were divided into SIRIO and Non-SIRIO groups and in <2 cm and >2 cm groups. Number of CT-scans, procedural time and patient's radiation dose were reported for each group. Diagnostic accuracy was obtained for bioptic procedures. (3) Results: One-hundred-ninety-three procedures were evaluated: 142 biopsies and 51 ablations. Seventy-four biopsy procedures were performed using SIRIO and 68 under standard CT-guidance; 27 ablative procedures were performed using SIRIO and 24 under standard CT-guidance. A statistically significant reduction in the number of CT-scans, procedural time and radiation dose was observed for percutaneous procedures performed using SIRIO, in both <2 cm and >2 cm groups. The greatest difference in all variables examined was found for procedures performed on lesions <2 cm. Higher diagnostic accuracy was found for all SIRIO-assisted biopsies. No major or minor complications occurred in any procedures. (4) Conclusion(s): The use of SIRIO significantly reduces the number of CT-scans, procedural time and patient's radiation dose in CT-guided percutaneous bone procedures, particularly for lesions <2 cm. An improvement in diagnostic accuracy was also achieved in SIRIO-assisted biopsies.Copyright © 2021 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.",Excluded
1548,"Growth hormone mitigates against lethal irradiation and enhances hematologic and immune recovery in mice and nonhuman primates Medications that can mitigate against radiation injury are limited. In this study, we investigated the ability of recombinant human growth hormone (rhGH) to mitigate against radiation injury in mice and nonhuman primates. BALB/c mice were irradiated with 7.5 Gy and treated post-irradiation with rhGH intravenously at a once daily dose of 20 mug/dose for 35 days. rhGH protected 17 out of 28 mice (60.7%) from lethal irradiation while only 3 out of 28 mice (10.7%) survived in the saline control group. A shorter course of 5 days of rhGH post-irradiation produced similar results. Compared with the saline control group, treatment with rhGH on irradiated BALB/c mice significantly accelerated overall hematopoietic recovery. Specifically, the recovery of total white cells, CD4 and CD8 T cell subsets, B cells, NK cells and especially platelets post radiation exposure were significantly accelerated in the rhGH-treated mice. Moreover, treatment with rhGH increased the frequency of hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells as measured by flow cytometry and colony forming unit assays in bone marrow harvested at day 14 after irradiation, suggesting the effects of rhGH are at the hematopoietic stem/progenitor level. rhGH mediated the hematopoietic effects primarily through their niches. Similar data with rhGH were also observed following 2 Gy sublethal irradiation of nonhuman primates. Our data demonstrate that rhGH promotes hematopoietic engraftment and immune recovery post the exposure of ionizing radiation and mitigates against the mortality from lethal irradiation even when administered after exposure. © 2010 Chen et al.",Excluded
2340,"Acoustic radiation force impulse (ARFI) shear wave elastography of the bowel wall in healthy volunteers and in ulcerative colitis Background: Acoustic radiation force impulse (ARFI) elastography is a non-invasive, ultrasound-based approach of evaluation of tissue elasticity. It has not yet been systematically applied to the bowel wall. Purpose(s): To perform ARFI elastography of the bowel wall in healthy volunteers and patients with ulcerative colitis (UC). Material(s) and Method(s): A high-frequency ultrasound (with bowel wall thickness and vascularization score) and an ARFI elastography of the bowel wall were performed in 20 patients with UC and 13 healthy volunteers. At least 10 ARFI measurements were obtained within the terminal ileum and the ascending, transverse, descending, and sigmoid colon and correlated with results of high-frequency ultrasound. Result(s): The UC group had mostly moderate disease activity. All patients had signs of inflammation upon B-mode ultrasound. Eight patients showed an ulcerative (ileo)pancolitis. Overall, ARFI elastography values and wall thickness were higher in the UC group than in the group of healthy volunteers (P = 0.021 and P < 0.001, respectively). ARFI velocities of the separate segments were significantly higher in the transverse (P = 0.045) and sigmoid colon (P = 0.032) in case of UC. Conclusion(s): ARFI elastography of the bowel wall of the colonic frame and the terminal ileum is feasible but shows high standard deviation. ARFI shear wave velocities appear to be slightly higher in patients with UC than in healthy volunteers, particularly in the sigmoid and transverse colon.

2676,"Feasibility and clinical value of computed tomography-guided125I brachytherapy for pain palliation in patients with retroperitoneal lymph node metastases Aims: The aim was to evaluate the feasibility and clinical value of computed tomography (CT)-guided125 I brachytherapy for pain palliation in patients with retroperitoneal lymph node metastases. Material(s) and Method(s): A total of 23 patients with retroperitoneal lymph node metastases and those who had moderate-to-severe pain from January 2014 to December 2018 were enrolled in the study. The primary tumors included pancreatic (n = 12), gastric (n = 4), hepatocellular (n = 4), colorectal (n = 2), and esophageal carcinomas (n= 1). Patients were treated with CT-guided percutaneous125 I brachytherapy during the study. The Brief Pain Inventory-Short Form was used to record and compare pain intensity and interference by pain. Treatment-related complications were also evaluated according to the Radiation Therapy Oncology Group/European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Late Radiation Morbidity Scoring Criteria. Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS software version 22.0 Results: The primary success rate of125 I seed implantation was 95.7% (22 of the 23 patients). As pain evolved, the patients achieved obvious pain palliation ratings for 'worst pain' and 'average pain' at 72 h and 4 weeks after brachytherapy, respectively, whereas 'pain right now' at 12 weeks was significantly relieved after brachytherapy. No serious complications developed during the perioperative period. Conclusion(s): In the treatment of intractable carcinomatous pain in patients with retroperitoneal lymph node metastases, CT-guided125 I brachytherapy is a feasible and effective modality for pain palliation.Copyright © 2020 Journal of Cancer Research and Therapeutics Published by Wolters Kluwer - Medknow.",Excluded

Method(s): A total of 749 patients from eight institutions were enrolled in this study. All of them underwent surgery followed by postoperative RT from 2003 to 2011; 246 (32.8%) received neoadjuvant chemotherapy and 649 (81.7%) received adjuvant chemotherapy. Adjuvant trastuzumab was administered to 386 patients (48.6%). Result(s): The median follow-up duration was 84 (range, 8-171) months. The 7-year disease-free and overall survival rates were 79.0% and 84.2%, respectively. On multivariate analysis, mastectomy, nodal involvement, and presence of lymphatic invasion were correlated with poor overall survival (p = 0.004, 0.022, and 0.011, respectively), whereas T stage and lymphatic invasion were associated with disease-free survival (p = 0.018 and 0.005, respectively). Regarding CNS failures, 30 brain metastases, 2 leptomeningeal metastases, and 8 brain and leptomeningeal metastases were noted. The 7-year CNS relapse-free survival rates in patients receiving and not receiving trastuzumab were 91.2% and 96.9%, respectively (p = 0.005). On multivariate analysis, the administration of adjuvant trastuzumab was the only prognostic factor in predicting a higher CNS failure rate (hazard ratio, 2.260; 95% confidence interval, 1.076-4.746; p = 0.031). Conclusion(s): Adjuvant trastuzumab was associated with higher CNS failure rate in Korean patients with HER2-enriched breast cancer. Close monitoring and reasonable approaches such as CNS penetrating HER2 blockades combined with the current standard therapy could contribute to improving intracranial tumor control and quality of life in patients with CNS metastasis from HER2-enriched breast cancer.Copyright © 2019 Korean Breast Cancer Society.",Excluded

732,"Ultrasonography-guided percutaneous nephrolithotomy Purpose: To evaluate the safety and efficacy of ultrasound-guided percutaneous nephrolithotomy (PCNL). Patients and Methods: Between August 2003 and December 2007, 47 patients were treated, 29 men and 18 women, with a mean age of 33.4 years (range 2167 yrs) and a mean stone size of 31.5mm (range 2446mm). All stones were located in the renal pelvis with mild to moderate hydronephrosis seen on intravenous urography. A ureteral stent was inserted cystoscopically, and saline was injected for more localization of the pelvicaliceal system (PCS), if needed. Puncture of the PCS was performed with an 18-gauge nephrostomy needle through the lower pole calyx, and all the stages, including dilatation, were performed under ultrasonography guidance. Result(s): Thirty-nine patients were stone free in the kidneys, ureters, and bladder the day after the operation. Five patients had multiple fragments that measured about 4 to 5mm, which passed in 4 weeks (total stone-free rate: 93.61%); failure occurred in two patients, and fluoroscopy was needed; two patients who had residual fragments that measured 10 and 12mm underwent shockwave lithotripsy; and in one patient, a fragment that measured 7 to 8mm migrated into the ureterit fragmented and was removed with a ureteroscope 2 days after the operation. Conclusion(s): PCNL using sonography is a good alternative to the fluoroscopic method. It is performed without radiation exposure to the surgeon and patient; however, more experience is needed.

2868,"Carbon ion radiotherapy for oligo-recurrent lung metastases from colorectal cancer: A feasibility study Background: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the efficacy and feasibility of carbon ion radiotherapy (CIRT) for oligo-recurrent lung tumors from colorectal cancer (CRC). Method(s): From May 1997 to October 2012, 34 consecutive patients with oligo-recurrent pulmonary metastases from CRC were treated with CIRT. The patients were not surgical candidates for medical reasons or patient refusal. Using a respiratory-gated technique, carbon ion therapy was delivered with curative intent using 4 coplanar beam angles. A median dose of 60 GyE (range, 44-64.8 GyE) was delivered to the planning target volume (PTV), with a median daily dose of 15 GyE (range, 3.6-44 GyE). Treatment outcome was analyzed in terms of local control rate (LCR), survival rate, and treatment-related complications. Result(s): In total, 34 patients with 44 oligo-recurrent pulmonary lesions were treated with CIRT. Median follow-up period was 23.7 months. The 2- and 3-year actuarial LCRs of the treated patients were 85.4% +/- 6.2% and 85.4% +/- 6.2%, respectively. Overall survival was 65.1% +/- 9.5% at 2 years, and 50.1% +/- 10.5% at 3 years. Although survival rates were relatively worse in the subsets of patients aged < 63 years or with early metastasis (< 36 months after resection of primary site), these factors were not significantly correlated with overall survival (P = 0.13 and 0.19, respectively). All treatment-related complications were self-limited, without any grade 3-5 toxicity. Conclusion(s): CIRT is one of the most effective nonsurgical treatments for colorectal lung metastases, which are relatively resistant to stereotactic body radiotherapy. CIRT is considered to be the least invasive approach even in patients who have undergone repeated prior thoracic metastasectomies. © 2014 Takahashi et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",Excluded
3324,"A Prospective Study of Distal Microscopic Spread in Rectal Cancer After Neoadjuvant Chemoradiation in Pinned and Unpinned Specimen The most important margin in determining the prognosis of rectal cancer is circumferential resection margin (CRM). But, the type of surgery is determined by distal rectal margin (DRM), whether sphincter saving procedure is possible or patient needs an abdominoperineal resection. There are no standardized uniform guidelines for measurement of DRM. The purpose of this study is to assess the distal microscopic spread beyond gross margin after neoadjuvant concurrent chemoradiation (CCRT) in rectal cancers, the factors influencing the distal microscopic spread, the shrinkage of the distal margin in pinned and unpinned fresh and fixed specimen, and to find out the best method of measurement of distal rectal margin. A prospective analytical study was conducted from May 2013 through February 2015 in 47 cases of carcinoma rectum (both AR and APR) who had received neoadjuvant CCRT. Fresh specimen was collected within 30 min of specimen retrieval and a longitudinal cut was made in the distal margin of all specimens. One side of the specimen was pinned onto a cork board and the other side was left unpinned. Measurements were made from the distal end of clinical gross tumor. DRM was determined in both pinned and unpinned sides in fresh and fixed specimen. Of the 47 patients, 2 patients (4.2%) had small focus of tumor beyond gross margins, 1 at 6 mm and another at 3.5 mm on the unpinned side. The average margin for fresh and fixed pinned specimens was 3.67 and 3.47 cm, respectively, with percentage shrinkage of 5.4% for the pinned specimens. The average margin for fresh and fixed unpinned specimens was 3.32 and 2.84 cm, respectively, with percentage shrinkage of 14.4% for the unpinned specimens. Six patients (12.7%) had complete pathological response. Correlation of distal margin was better in pinned specimen. A correction factor of 15% for shrinkage needs to be taken into account while assessing unpinned specimen. Only in 4.2% of patients, there was distal submucosal spread beyond gross margin. Long-term follow up is required for assessing adequacy of DRM post neoadjuvant CCRT.Copyright © 2017, Indian Association of Surgical Oncology.",Excluded
1509,"A phase I study of gefitinib with concurrent dose-escalated weekly docetaxel and conformal three-dimensional thoracic radiation followed by consolidative docetaxel and maintenance gefitinib for patients with stage III non-small cell lung cancer BACKGROUND: Concurrent radiation and chemotherapy is the standard of care for good performance status patients with stage III non-small cell lung cancer. Locoregional control remains a significant factor relating to poor outcome. Preclinical and early clinical data suggest that docetaxel and gefitinib have radiosensitizing activity. This study sought to define the maximum tolerated dose of weekly docetaxel that could be given with daily gefitinib and concurrent thoracic radiation therapy., PATIENTS AND MATERIALS: Patients with histologically confirmed, inoperable stage III non-small cell lung cancer and good performance status (Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group 0-1) were eligible for this study. Patients received three-dimensional conformal thoracic radiation to a dose of 70 Gy concurrently with oral gefitinib at a dose of 250 mg daily and intravenous, weekly docetaxel at escalating doses from 15 to 30 mg/m2 in cohorts of patients. Patients were given a 2-week rest period after the concurrent therapy, during which they received only gefitinib. After the 2-week rest period, patients received consolidation chemotherapy with docetaxel 75 mg/m2 given every 21 days for two cycles. Maintenance gefitinib was continued until disease progression or study completion., RESULTS: Sixteen patients were enrolled on the study between December 2003 and April 2007 with the following characteristics: median age, 64 years (range 43-79 years); M/F: 9/7; and performance status 0/1, 1/15. Dose-limiting pulmonary toxicity and esophagitis were encountered at a weekly docetaxel dose of 25 mg/m2, resulting in a maximum tolerated dose of 20 mg/m2/wk. Overall, grade 3/4 hematologic toxicity was observed in 27% of patients. Grade 3/4 esophageal and pulmonary toxicities were reported in 27% and 20% of patients, respectively. The overall response rate was 46%, and the median survival for all patients was 21 months., CONCLUSIONS: Concurrent thoracic radiation with weekly docetaxel and daily gefitinib is feasible but results in moderate toxicity. For further studies, the recommended weekly docetaxel dose for this chemoradiation regimen is 20 mg/m2.",Excluded
1152,"Effect of low-level laser therapy (GaAlAs) on bone regeneration in midpalatal anterior suture after surgically assisted rapid maxillary expansion Objective: The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of laser therapy on bone regeneration in the midpalatal anterior suture (MPAS) after surgically assisted rapid maxillary expansion (SARME). Method(s): Thirteen patients aged between 18 and 33 years old with maxillary transverse deficiency (>=7.0 mm) were evaluated. All patients underwent subtotal Le Fort I osteotomy with separation of the pterygomaxillary suture with the use of Hyrax expander, and were divided into 2 groups: control group (n = 6) and laser group (n = 7). A GaAlAs laser (P = 100 mW, lambda = 830 nm, O = 0.06 cm2) was used. The laser was applied in 8 treatment sessions with intervals of 48 hours. Each treatment session consisted of laser applications, per point (E = 8.4J, ED = 140J/cm2), at 3 points on the MPAS, and total dose of E = 25.2 J, ED = 420 J/cm2. Digital radiographs were taken before the surgical procedure and at 1-, 2-, 3-, 4-, and 7-month follow-up visits. Optical density analysis of the regenerated bone was performed using Adobe Photoshop 8.0 software. Result(s): Bone regeneration associated with the use of laser after SARME showed a statistically significant difference. A higher mineralization rate was found in the laser group (26.3%, P < .001) than the control group. Conclusion(s): Low-level laser irradiation (GaAlAs) accelerates bone regeneration in MPAS after SARME. However, the optical density measurements after 7 months of follow-up were lower in comparison with the preoperative measurements. © 2010 Mosby, Inc. All rights reserved.",Excluded

We investigated the clinical features of GI toxicity after CRT in patients with LAPC and examined the effect of GI hemorrhage on survival. Method(s): Patients enrolled in this study had received CRT for pathologically proven LAPC. Their medical records were retrospectively reviewed. Result(s): A total of 156 patients with LAPC (median age, 65 years; range, 39 to 90 years) who received treatment between August 2005 and March 2009 were included in this study. The most common GI toxicities were ulcer formation (25.6%) and hemorrhage (25.6%), and the most common grade 3 to grade 5 GI toxicity was hemorrhage (65%). The origins of GI hemorrhage were gastric ulcer (37.5%), duodenal ulcer (37.5%), and radiation gastritis (15.0%). The independent risk factor for GI hemorrhage was tumor location in the pancreatic body. The median overall survival of the patients with a GI hemorrhage was 13.8 months (range, 2.8 to 50.8 months) and was not significantly different from that of patients without GI hemorrhage. Conclusion(s): GI hemorrhage was common in patients with LAPC after CRT.

1160,"Deficiency in PER proteins has no effect on the rate of spontaneous and radiation-induced carcinogenesis There is a growing body of evidence that components of the circadian clock are involved in modulation of numerous signaling pathways, and that clock deregulation due to environmental or genetic factors contributes to the development of various pathologies, including cancer. Previous work performed in tissue culture and in in vivo mouse models defined mammalian PERIOD proteins as tumor suppressors, although some experimental inconsistencies (the use of mice on mixed genetic background, lack of sexual discrimination) did not allow a definitive conclusion. To address this issue in a systematic way, we performed a detailed analysis comparing the incidence of tumor development after low-dose ionizing radiation in male and female wild-type, Per1-/-, and Per2-/- mice. We showed that in contrast to previous reports deficiency in either Per1 or Per2 genes by itself does not make mice more tumor-prone; moreover, some of the long-term effects of ionizing radiation in Per2-deficient mice are reminiscent more of accelerated aging rather than tumor-prone phenotype. Our histopathological analysis also revealed significant sexual dimorphism both in the rate of radiation-induced tumorigenesis and in the spectrum of tumors developed, which underscores the importance of using sex-matched experimental groups for in vivo studies. Based on our results, we suggest that the role of PER proteins as bone fide tumor suppressors needs to be reevaluated. © 2013 Landes Bioscience.",Included
3237,"Sleep Disturbance and Pain Severity and Multi-site Pain: A Prospective 10.7-year Follow-up Study Background/Purpose: Sleep disturbance is often comorbid with chronic pain disorders, with emerging evidence suggesting a stronger effect of sleep disturbance on pain than vice versa; however, few studies have evaluated the long-term effect of sleep disturbance on pain. This study sought to examine the association of sleep disturbance with knee pain severity and number of painful sites (NPS) and investigate whether persistent sleep disturbance increases the risk of persistent pain. Method(s): 1,099 community-dwelling older adults (age: mean+/-SD, 63+/-7.5 years; 51% female) were recruited and followed-up at 2.6, 5.1 and 10.7-year later. Data on demographics, body mass index, physical activity, comorbidities were collected. At each time-point, sleep disturbance, knee pain severity and NPS were assessed by using questionnaires. Radiographic knee osteoarthritis (ROA) was measured using x-ray. Multi-site pain (MSP) was defined as NPS >=2. Persistent pain was defined as having knee pain or MSP at all time-points. Multivariable mixed-effects models and log-binomial regression were applied for the analyses. Result(s): Sleep disturbance was associated with greater knee pain severity (beta 0.91, 95%CI 0.70-1.11) and higher risk of having more NPS [(Relative risk (RR) 1.10, 95%CI 1.07-1.14] in a dose-response manner in multivariable analyse with adjustment for age, sex, body mass index, physical activity, comorbidities, pain medications, ever smoking, emotional problems, employment, and education level. Persistent sleep disturbance was associated with a greater risk of persistent knee pain (RR 1.90, 1.26-2.87) and MSP (RR 1.29, 1.07-1.56). In participants with ROA, results were similar apart from the link between sleep disturbance and persistent pain. pain. Conclusion(s): Sleep disturbance was independently associated with greater pain severity and significantly increases risk for MSP with a long-term effect of sleep on pain in general and ROA population, suggesting beneficial effects of treating sleep problems on long-term pain control.",Excluded

1371,"Drug exposure and risk of microscopic colitis: a nationwide Danish case-control study with 5751 cases BACKGROUND: Previous small studies have indicated that commonly prescribed drugs may be associated with microscopic colitis (MC). With an increasing incidence of MC, it is important to explore the association between exposure to proton pump inhibitors (PPIs), nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, statins, and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors and MC in a larger setting., METHODS: Case-control study based on nationwide Danish registries. The study included all patients with MC diagnosis during the period 2005 to 2011. One hundred sex- and age-matched controls per case were randomly selected among the Danish population. Prescriptions were recorded in a Prescription Register in the year before the first recorded MC diagnosis. Effect measure is the adjusted odds ratio (OR) of collagenous colitis (CC) and lymphocytic colitis (LC) according to prescriptions of PPIs, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, statins, and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors. Within the control group, we identified a subgroup with MC-free colonic biopsies., RESULTS: We identified 3474 patients with CC and 2277 with LC and found a positive association between redemption of prescriptions for PPIs and both CC (OR = 7.04; 95% confidence interval, 6.55-7.56) and LC (OR = 3.37; 95% confidence interval, 3.08-3.69). Among patients with MC-free colon biopsies in the control group, the association between PPIs and CC was strongly positive (OR = 3.47; 95% confidence interval, 3.08-3.89). Adding this parameter to the model attenuated all of the associations, but they remained positive for PPIs versus CC and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors versus LC., CONCLUSIONS: We found positive associations between exposure to all 4 medication classes and MC.

Eye Physics I-125 plaque treatment modeled with Plaque Simulator (PS) software yields similar results to COMS. Herein, we report results from a series of 15 patients treated with ruthenium-106 (Ru-106) plaque brachytherapy using PS pretreatment modeling for plaque localization and dosimetry., METHODS AND MATERIALS: Fifteen patients with medium-sized choroidal melanomas (2.84-5.5 mm in apical height and a basal diameter of 7.8-12.6 mm) treated with ruthenium brachytherapy from 2003 to 2005 were evaluated retrospectively. Baseline and followup data were evaluated for tumor height, best corrected visual acuity, radiation retinopathy, radiation optic neuropathy, postradiation cataract formation, diplopia, and ptosis. Tumor response for both Ru-106 and I-125 plaques planned using the same PS pretreatment modeling was evaluated and compared., RESULTS: Isotope-specific radiation profiles were compared, and rates of local treatment failure (0%), optic neuropathy (6.7%), retinopathy (20%), and cataracts (33%) were evaluated. Five year-treated tumor heights were approximately 0.61 +/- 0.29 (I-125, n = 16) and 0.53 +/- 0.17 (Ru-106, n = 6) of their heights at diagnosis., CONCLUSIONS: This patient subset had background characteristics very similar to those of the COMS and patients treated at our institution with I-125 plaques. Treatment response was equivalent although radiation complications occurred slightly less frequently in the Ru-106 group compared with those treated with I-125. Image-guided three-dimensional pretreatment modeling for plaque localization and dosimetry seems to work equally as well for Ru as for I-125 plaques and justifies more extensive investigation.

Our purpose was to compare 2x weekly and 4x weekly therapy with narrow-band UVB at low doses for psoriasis vulgaris. Method(s): Sixty-nine patients with moderately severe psoriasis were recruited and allocated to the 2x weekly or 4x weekly treatment group. The patients were treated with a new protocol using low doses of narrow-band UVB with varied exposure increments. Outcomes were evaluated by means of Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI) scores, time (weeks), cumulative UVB dose and number of treatments to clearance. Result(s): No significant difference was found between the two regimens in the PASI score at the end of treatment, in the proportion of patients whose skin cleared during treatment and in the time to clearance (8 weeks). Those who completed treatment achieved clearance after a median of 16 exposures with 2x weekly treatment compared with 32 exposures with 4x weekly treatment (P=0.0304), and 12.5 minimal erythema dose multiples (MEDs) compared with 39.7 MEDs (P=0.0470). Acute side effects of the treatment were similar for the two groups (P=0.8462). Conclusion(s): For skin phototype III-V populations, a greater long-term risk is expected, connected with the higher cumulative UVB dose and number of exposures required in the 4x weekly group. Therefore, 4x weekly phototherapy will no longer be used for psoriasis.",Excluded
2928,"Pretreatment carcinoembryonic antigen level is a risk factor for para-aortic lymph node recurrence in addition to squamous cell carcinoma antigen following definitive concurrent chemoradiotherapy for squamous cell carcinoma of the uterine cervix BACKGROUND: To identify pretreatment carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) levels as a risk factor for para-aortic lymph node (PALN) recurrence following concurrent chemoradiotherapy (CCRT) for cervical cancer., METHODS: From March 1995 to January 2008, 188 patients with squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) of the uterine cervix were analyzed retrospectively. No patient received PALN irradiation as the initial treatment. CEA and squamous cell carcinoma antigen (SCC-Ag) were measured before and after radiotherapy. PALN recurrence was detected by computer tomography (CT) scans. We analyzed the actuarial rates of PALN recurrence by using Kaplan-Meier curves. Multivariate analyses were carried out with Cox regression models. We stratified the risk groups based on the hazard ratios (HR)., RESULTS: Both pretreatment CEA levels >= 10 ng/mL and SCC-Ag levels < 10 ng/mL (p < 0.001, HR = 8.838), SCC-Ag levels >= 40 ng/mL (p < 0.001, HR = 12.551), and SCC-Ag levels of 10-40 ng/mL (p < 0.001, HR = 4.2464) were significant factors for PALN recurrence. The corresponding 5-year PALN recurrence rates were 51.5%, 84.8%, and 27.5%, respectively. The 5-year PALN recurrence rate for patients with both low (< 10 ng/mL) SCC and CEA was only 9.6%. CEA levels >= 10 ng/mL or SCC-Ag levels >= 10 ng/mL at PALN recurrence were associated with overall survival after an isolated PALN recurrence. Pretreatment CEA levels >= 10 ng/mL were also associated with survival after an isolated PALN recurrence., CONCLUSIONS: Pretreatment CEA >= 10 ng/mL is an additional risk factor of PALN relapse following definitive CCRT for SCC of the uterine cervix in patients with pretreatment SCC-Ag levels < 10 ng/mL. More comprehensive examinations before CCRT and intensive follow-up schedules are suggested for early detection and salvage in patients with SCC-Ag or CEA levels >= 10 ng/mL.",Excluded
28,"The effect of sex difference on induction of intestinal metaplasia in rats Attempts were made to examine the sexual effects on the induction of intestinal metaplasia in rats. The number and locus of intestinal metaplasia in the gastric region induced by 2,000 rads of X-ray were greater in the male than in the female. Alkaline phosphatase activity appeared in the male only. The intestinal metaplasia induced by stomach antigen injection in the male persisted longer than in the female. Moreover, the incidence of intestinal metaplasia caused by whole body irradiation in ovariectomized rats was significantly higher than in the sham-ovariectomized ones. Therefore, it is likely that male sex hormones are promoting while female sex hormones are inhibiting the development of intestinal metaplasia.",Included
786,"Delayed imaging in routine CT examinations of the abdomen and pelvis: Is it worth the additional cost of radiation and time? OBJECTIVE. The purpose of this study was to retrospectively assess the potential benefits of delayed phase imaging series in routine CT scans of the abdomen and pelvis. MATERIALS AND METHODS. Routine contrast-enhanced abdominopelvic CT scans of 1000 consecutively examined patients (912 men, 88 women; average age, 60 years; range, 22-94 years) were retrospectively evaluated, and the added benefits of the delayed phase series through the abdomen were recorded for each examination. Examinations performed for indications requiring multiphasic imaging were excluded. Images were reviewed by two fellowship-trained abdominal radiologists, who were blinded to official CT reports. All examinations were performed between July 2008 and February 2010 at a single institution. Radiation doses for both the portal venous and delayed phases, when available, were analyzed to assess the effect of the delayed phase on overall radiation exposure. RESULTS. Forty-two patients (4.2%) had findings that were further characterized or were observed only in the delayed phase. Most were incidental findings that could have been confirmed at noninvasive follow-up imaging, such as sonography or unenhanced CT or MRI. The most common findings were liver hemangioma (n = 12), adrenal adenoma (n = 12), and parapelvic renal cysts (n = 6). The most important finding was detection of a renal mass in one patient (0.1%). The mass was seen only on the delayed phase images but was difficult to appreciate in the portal venous phase. In the other 958 patients (95.8%), delayed imaging was of no benefit. In addition, use of the delayed phase resulted in a mean 59.5% increase in effective CONCLUSION. An additional delayed phase through the abdomen in routine contrastenhanced CT examinations of the abdomen and pelvis is of low yield, particularly if reliable follow-up imaging to further elucidate uncertain findings is available. © American Roentgen Ray Society.",Excluded
93,"Cervical lymphatic metastases from occult primary tumor. A nation-wide 20-year study from the Danish society of head and neck oncology INTRODUCTION: The management of patients with cervical lymph node metastases from unknown primary tumours is a major challenge in oncology. This study presents data collected from all five oncology centres in Denmark. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Of the 352 consecutive patients with squamous cell or undifferentiated tumours seen from 1975 to 1995, a total of 277 (79%) were treated with radical intent. Most patients received radiotherapy to both sides of the neck as well as elective irradiation of the mucosal sites in nasopharynx, oropharynx, hypopharynx and larynx (81%). Irradiation of the ipsilateral neck only was done in 26 patients (10%). Radical surgery was the only treatment in 23 N1-N2 patients (9%). RESULT(S): The five-year estimates of neck control, disease-specific survival and overall survival for radically treated patients were 51%, 48% and 36%, respectively. The emergence of the occult primary was observed in 66 patients (19%). About half of the emerging primaries were within the head and neck region with oropharynx, hypopharynx and oral cavity being the most common sites. Emerging primaries outside the head and neck region were primarily located in the lung (19 patients) and oesophagus (five patients). The most important factor for neck control was nodal stage (5-year estimates 69% [N1], 58% [N2] and 30% [N3]). Other important parameters for neck control and disease-specific survival included haemoglobin, gender and overall treatment time. Patients treated with ipsilateral radiotherapy had a relative risk of recurrence in the head and neck region of 1.9 compared to patients treated at both neck and mucosa. At five years, the estimated control rates were 27% (ipsilateral) and 51% (bilateral; p = 0.05). The 5-year disease-specific survival estimates were 28% and 45%, respectively (p = 0.10). DISCUSSION: Extensive irradiation to both sides of the neck and the mucosa in the entire pharyngeal axis and larynx resulted in significantly fewer loco-regional failures compared to patients treated with ipsilateral techniques, but only a trend towards better survival. Determination of the optimal strategy in terms of loco-regional control, survival and morbidity requires a prospective randomized trial.",Excluded
3489,"The outcome of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) patients treated with R-CHOP is not predicted by interim evaluation of 18-FDG-positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET) Background: In DLBCL patients PET evaluation has a defined role to assess the final response, but the predictive value of interim PET is contradictory. Standardized criteria of interpretation of Interim PET have not been well established yet and the visual analysis of PET results by dichotomous evaluation as positive or negative is difficult to apply. Aim of study. to determine the predictive value of interim (I-PET) and final PET (F-PET) on Progression Free Survival (PFS) in DLBCL patients treated with R-CHOP. Patients and Methods: From April 2004 to December 2008, 82 newly diagnosed DLBCL patients treated in five Hematology Departments were included. Clinical features were as follows: median age 56 years (19-81); 42 males and 40 females, 29 stage I-II and 53 stage III-IV; 47 L/LI and 35 I/IH IPI score. All patients were treated according to the planned therapy, not modified by I-PET results, with 6-8 RCHOP. IF-RT was planned to areas of bulky disease and given to 13 patients. All patients had PET scan performed at the diagnosis, during treatment (I-PET) and at the end of therapy (F-PET). All PET results were centrally reviewed and defined as positive or negative by visual dichotomous response criteria according to the First Consensus Conference (Deauville 2009). Result(s): All patients were evaluable for response. I-PET was performed after two R-CHOP in 46 pts, after three in 13 and after four in 23. At the end of therapy 73 pts (89%) achieved a CR and nine (11%) were non responders. Fifty-five patients (67%) were negative and 27 (33%) positive at the I-PET; 69 pts (84%) were negative and 13 (16%) positive at the F-PET. 15/27 (56%) I-PET positive patients became F-PET negative at the end of the therapy. The concordance between clinical CR and F-PET negativity was 99%: one CR pt was false F-PET positive due to parothid carcinoma. The prognostic impact of PET results on the outcome was evaluated. With a median FU of 18 months, Progression-free survival (PFS) was 80%. PFS did not correlate with I-PET results, 18-months PFS rates were: 84% in I-PET negative patients and 74%in I-PET positive patients (p.198) (Figure 1A). Conversely F-PET strongly predicted PFS (p.015): 84% in F-PET negative patients and 61% in F-PET positive patients. (Figure 1B). A further analysis for progression was performed to adjust the effect of I-PET analysis for other known risk factors (age >=60, stage, PS, IPI, LDH, bulky, number of extranodal sites, Bone Marrow involvement): only LDH (p.005) and IPI 0-2 vs. 3-5 (p.001) were confirmed as independent predictors for progression. The use of G-CSF during treatment did not influenced IPET results. Conclusion(s): Our results indicate that in DLBCL patients treated with R-CHOP a positive interim PET did not predict a worse outcome. Conversely, final PET results strongly correlate with PFS. A longer follow up is necessary to validate our data. Prospective larger studies and standarditation of criteria for interim PET are needed to assess the prognostic value of interim PET in DLBCL patients. (Graph presented).",Excluded
2337,"Long-Term, Prospective Performance of the MD Anderson Dysphagia Inventory in ""Low-Intermediate Risk"" Oropharyngeal Carcinoma After Intensity Modulated Radiation Therapy PURPOSE: To characterize long-term MD Anderson Dysphagia Inventory (MDADI) results after primary intensity modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) for oropharyngeal carcinoma (OPC) among patients with ""low-intermediate risk"" OPC who would be eligible for current trials (eg, ECOG 3311, NRG HN002, CRUK PATHOS)., METHODS AND MATERIALS: A retrospective pooled analysis combined data from 3 single-institution clinical trials for advanced-stage head and neck carcinoma. Inclusion criteria were clinical stage III/IV OPC (T1-2/N1-2b, T3/N0-2b) treated with definitive split-field IMRT and prospectively collected MDADI at baseline and at least 1 posttreatment interval available in trial databases. Patients were sampled to represent likely human papillomavirus (HPV)-associated disease (HPV+/p16+ or <10 pack-years if HPV/p16 unknown). The MDADI composite scores were collected at baseline and 6, 12, and 24 months after treatment. Pairwise tests were Bonferroni corrected for multiple comparisons., RESULTS: Forty-six patients were included. All received bilateral neck irradiation with a median dose of 70 Gy and systemic therapy (57% concurrent, 43% induction only). Overall the mean baseline MDADI composite score was 90.1, dropping to 74.6 at 6 months (P<.0001) and rising to 78.5 (P<.0001) and 83.1 (P=.002) by 12 and 24 months relative to baseline, respectively, representing a clinically meaningful drop in MDADI scores at 6 months that partially recovers by 24 months (6 vs 24 months, P=.05). Poor MDADI scores (composite <60) were reported in 4%, 11%, 15%, and 9% of patients at baseline and 6, 12, and 24 months, respectively. Fifteen percent of patients had a persistently depressed composite score by at least 20 points at the 24-month interval., CONCLUSION: ""Low-intermediate risk"" patients with OPC treated with laryngeal/esophageal inlet dose-optimized split-field IMRT are highly likely to report recovery of acceptable swallowing function in long-term follow-up. Only 15% report poor swallowing function and/or persistently depressed MDADI at 12 months or more after IMRT. These data serve as a benchmark future trial design and endpoint interpretation.

1557,"Differences in acupuncture point SP-10 and non-acupuncture point following subcutaneous injection of Tc-99m pertechnetate A new method of radionuclide venography, namely SC-RNV, by subcutaneous injection of Tc-99m pertechnetate at acupuncture points was recently developed in our laboratory. The time-activity curve of SC-RNV can be divided into 3 phases as: the phase of diffusion of radioisotopes through the subcutaneous space, the phase of entrance of radioisotopes into intravascular space to reach a peak concentration and the phase of equilibrium state of radioisotopes in the intravascular space. In this study, we used the 3 phases of SC-RNV to evaluate the absorption of Tc-99m pertechnetate injected subcutaneously in the acupuncture point SP-10 (Xuehai) and in a non-acupuncture point near SP-10. The results revealed that the absorption of Tc-99m pertechnetate via SP-10 was significantly greater than that of non-acupuncture point, evidenced by shorter phase 1, higher peak activity and greater accelerating rate of phase 2. This suggests that the absorption of radioisotopes from acupuncture point is faster and greater than that of non-acupuncture point.",Excluded
1505,"Correlation between radiation dose and p53 protein expression levels in human lymphocytes The aim of this research was to evaluate the relationship between p53 protein levels and absorbed doses from in vitro irradiated human lymphocytes. For this, samples of blood from 23 donors were irradiated with 0.5; 1; 2; and 4 Gy from a Cobalt-60 source, and the percentages of lymphocytes expressing p53 were scored using Flow Cytometry. The subjects were divided into 3 groups, in accordance with the p53 levels expressed per radiation dose: low (Group I), high (Group II), and excessive levels (Group III). For all groups, the analyses showed that the p53 expression levels increase with the absorbed dose. Particularly for groups I and II, the correlation between this protein expression and the dose follows the linear-quadratic model, such as for radioinduced chromosomal aberrations. In conclusion, our findings indicate possible applications of this approach in evaluating individual radiosensitivity prior to radiotherapeutical procedures as well as in medical surveillance of occupationally exposed workers. Furthermore, due to the rapidity of flow-cytometric analyses, the methodology here employed would play an important role in emergency responses to a large-scale radiation incident where many people may have been exposed.",Included
1182,"Clinical and Spectrophotometric Evaluation of Skin Photoadaptation in Vitiligo Patients after a Short Cycle of NB-UVB Phototherapy BACKGROUND: The phenomenon of photoadaptation to narrow-band ultraviolet B (NB-UVB) radiation has been previously described in vitiligo and has usually been clinically measured by the assessment of the minimal erythema dose (MED) after phototesting., OBJECTIVES: To assess the photoadaptive response in vitiligo and healthy skin after NB-UVB phototherapy not only clinically, but also by spectrophotometry., MATERIALS AND METHODS: Fourteen patients affected by generalized vitiligo underwent NB-UVB phototherapy twice weekly for 12 weeks. Before and after phototherapy, a phototesting procedure was administered on vitiligo patches and adjacent healthy skin with a solar simulated radiation (SSR). Visual assessment of the MED took place after 24 h. A spectrophotometer was used to assess the a* value and the melanin index (MI*), as signs of skin erythema and pigmentation. The photoadaptation factor (MED-PF) and the a* photoadaptation factor (a*-PF) were calculated., RESULTS: After NB-UVB phototherapy, both vitiligo and healthy skin showed an increase in MED and MI* values and a reduction of skin erythema compared to baseline (p < 0.05). MED-PF data showed a photoadaptation in 10 (71.4%) vitiligo lesions and in 12 (85.7%) healthy skin areas. The assessment of the a*-PF showed a negative mean percentage value in all affected and unaffected skin areas., CONCLUSIONS: A short cycle of NB-UVB phototherapy can induce photoadaptation in vitiligo by increasing the MED and reducing skin erythema after stimulation with SSR. This is most likely due to the physical filter function induced by ultraviolet radiation. Copyright © 2019 S. Karger AG, Basel.",Excluded
1911,"A simplified approach to pulmonary vein visualization in cryo-balloon ablation of atrial fibrillation Background: Pulmonary vein isolation (PVI) by cryo balloon (CB) ablation is an effective and effcient alternative to radio frequency ablation in patients with atrial fbrillation (AF). It requires less technical infrastructure (e.g. 3D mapping systems) and typically has a steeper learning curve. Selective, multiplanar pulmonary vein (PV) angiography (PVA) has been established as the gold standard for PV visualization in CB PVI. Objective(s): We aimed to simplify this approach to achieve a reduction of procedural complexity and radiation exposure Methods: Patients with paroxysmal or early persistent AF undergoing CB based PVI from Jan. 2015 to Dec. 2017 were retrospectively analyzed. Patients received conventional (PVA) or unselective left atrial angiography (LAA) for PV visualization. LAA was acquired by contrast injection in the AP projection. Also, in the LAA group the AP plane was maintained during the CB procedure, unless satisfactory PV occlusion could not be achieved. Result(s): 336 patients were analyzed (female n=127, 38%; age 62+/-0.6 years; BMI 27+/-0.2 kg/m2; LA volume 66+/-2.4 ml; EHRA 2.3+/-0.04; CHA2DS2-VASc 2.0+/-0.1). 87 patients (26%) received PVA and 249 (74%) LAA. No signifcant differences in clinical characteristics were observed. LAA required fewer PV visualization sequences (2.0+/-0.05 vs 2.0+/-0.05; p<0.0001), resulting in reduced procedure (93+/-1.79 vs 110.8+/-3.18 min; p<0.0001), as well as lower fuoroscopy time (14.2+/-0.43 vs 19+/-0.78 min; p<0.0001) and radiation dose (634.6+/-69.58 vs 1574+/-190.8 cGcm2; p<0.0001). There was a trend to lower contrast use (78.7+/-2.8 vs. 91.3+/-5.99 ml; p=0.0573). Markers of procedural quality (PV occlusion, CB temperature, time to isolation) showed no signifcant differences. Number of CB applications (1.4+/-0.02 vs. 1.6+/-0.05; p<0.0001) and total application time per vein (297.9+/-4.62 vs. 348.9+/-11.03 seconds; p<0.0001) were slightly but signifcantly higher in the PVA group. Minor complications were equally distributed between both groups. Only one major complication (stroke) was observed in the PVA group. Conclusion(s): A simplifed CB PVI protocol, using LAA for PV visualization, facilitates reduced procedure time and radiation exposure while retaining procedural quality and safety.",Excluded
1737,"Skeletal muscle mass and sarcopenia can be determined with 1.5-T and 3-T neck MRI scans, in the event that no neck CT scan is performed Objectives: Cross-sectional area (CSA) measurements of the neck musculature at the level of third cervical vertebra (C3) on CT scans are used to diagnose radiological sarcopenia, which is related to multiple adverse outcomes in head and neck cancer (HNC) patients. Alternatively, these assessments are performed with neck MRI, which has not been validated so far. For that, the objective was to evaluate whether skeletal muscle mass and sarcopenia can be assessed on neck MRI scans. Method(s): HNC patients were included between November 2014 and November 2018 from a prospective data-biobank. CSAs of the neck musculature at the C3 level were measured on CT (n = 125) and MRI neck scans (n = 92 on 1.5-T, n = 33 on 3-T). Measurements were converted into skeletal muscle index (SMI), and sarcopenia was defined (SMI < 43.2 cm2/m2). Pearson correlation coefficients, Bland-Altman plots, McNemar test, Cohen's kappa coefficients, and interclass correlation coefficients (ICCs) were estimated. Result(s): CT and MRI correlated highly on CSA and SMI (r = 0.958-0.998, p < 0.001). The Bland-Altman plots showed a nihil mean DELTASMI (- 0.13-0.44 cm2/m2). There was no significant difference between CT and MRI in diagnosing sarcopenia (McNemar, p = 0.5-1.0). Agreement on sarcopenia diagnosis was good with kappa = 0.956-0.978 and kappa = 0.870-0.933, for 1.5-T and 3-T respectively. Observer ICCs in MRI were excellent. In general, T2-weighted images had the best correlation and agreement with CT. Conclusion(s): Skeletal muscle mass and sarcopenia can interchangeably be assessed on CT and 1.5-T and 3-T MRI neck scans. This allows future clinical outcome assessment during treatment irrespective of used modality. Key Points: * Screening for low amount of skeletal muscle mass is usually measured on neck CT scans and is highly clinical relevant as it is related to multiple adverse outcomes in head and neck cancer patients. * We found that skeletal muscle mass and sarcopenia determined on CT and 1.5-T and 3-T MRI neck scans at the C3 level can be used interchangeably. * When CT imaging of the neck is missing for skeletal muscle mass analysis, patients can be assessed with 1.5-T or 3-T neck MRIs.Copyright © 2020, The Author(s).",Excluded
18,"Clinical usefulness of the novel tag-less Pillcam patency capsule for the screening of patients with suspected small bowel strictures BACKGROUND:Capsule endoscopy (CE) is a non-invasive diagnostic tool for the study of the small bowel. The main complication of CE is capsule retention, defined as a failure to excrete the capsule for 2 weeks or more requiring directed medical, endoscopic, or surgical intervention. Due to the risk of capsule retention, CE is contraindicated in patients with suspected small bowel strictures. The novel tag-less PillCam Patency Capsule (PPC) for preventing capsule retention which was marketed in 2012 in Japan has expanded the indication of small bowel disease for CE. OBJECTIVE(S):We investigated the safety and clinical usefulness of the novel tag-less PillCam Patency Capsule for preventing capsule retention in patients with suspected small bowel strictures. PATIENTS AND METHODS:Sixteen patients who suspected small bowel strictures were included (mean age: 66.2) in this retrospective study. If patients had already excreted the intact PPC in the stool at 30 h after ingestion of PPC, patency of the small bowel was confirmed. If the confirmation at 30 h was not successful, reconfirmation was performed by abdominal X-ray and/or computed tomography (CT) within 33 hours after the ingestion. If the intact PPC had reached to colon, we judged patency"". Except for the above-mentioned, we judged ""no patency"". If patency was established, then the patients underwent CE. RESULT(S):Male/Female (8/8). Clinical indications before the PPC were melena or hematochezia (6), abdominal pain (3), abdominal distension (2), abdominal mass (4) constipation (1), diarrhea (1), anemia (2), no abdominal symptom (4). A history of abdominal surgery +/- (4/12). A history of abdominal irradiation +/- (5/11). Fourteen cases (87.5%) had complete PPC examination followed by CE within 2 weeks. We judged 2 cases ""no patency"". Each of two cases showed the symptoms of ileus. One case needed ileus tube insertion and gastrografin enema showed stricture. In another case, gastric tube was inserted. In both cases, the ileus improved after conservative treatment. Fourteen patients underwent CE following the patency capsule examination. In 10 cases (71.4%) of them, the significant pathologic findings were found by CE. Although the confirmation of the patency by PPC was established, retention occurred in one case with asymptomatic. The patient had prior operation history of ileum-transverse colon bypass. CONCLUSION(S):Passage is a direct proof of the patency of small bowel. The tag-less PillCam Patency Capsule was useful to evaluate the patency of the small bowel to confirm the safer capsule endoscopy in patients with suspected small bowel strictures. However, the PPC itself may show the symptoms of ileus. The cases with abdominal surgical history could be a risk for capsule retention even though PillCam Patency Capsule confirmed the patency.""",Excluded
354,"Left bundle branch block and suspected myocardial infarction: Does chronicity of the branch block matter? Background: Our aim was to investigate if patients with suspected myocardial infarction (MI) and a new or presumed new left bundle branch block (nLBBB) were treated according to the ESC reperfusion guidelines and to compare them with patients having a previously known LBBB (oLBBB). Furthermore, we investigated the prevalence of ST-segment concordance in this population. Method(s): Retrospective data was collected from the Swedeheart registry for patients admitted to the cardiac care unit at Orebro University Hospital with LBBB and suspected MI during 2009 and 2010. The patients were divided in two age groups; <80 or >=80 years and analysed for LBBB chronicity (nLBBB or oLBBB), MI, and reperfusion treatment. We also compared our data with the national Swedeheart database for 2009. Result(s): A total of 99 patients fulfilled the inclusion criteria. A diagnosis of MI was significantly more common in the group >=80 years compared to the group <80 years (53.8 vs. 25%, p=0.007). The rate of MI was similar in the groups with nLBBB and oLBBB (33 and 37% respectively, p=0.912). Of the 36 patients with a final diagnosis of MI, only eight (22%) had nLBBB. Reperfusion treatment, defined as an acute coronary angiography with or without intervention, was significantly more often performed in patients with nLBBB compared to patients with oLBBB (42 vs. 8%, p<0.001). The rate of MI and reperfusion treatment did not differ between our institution and the Swedish national data. ST-concordance was present in only two cases, one of which did not suffer an MI. Conclusion(s): The proportion of patients receiving reperfusion treatment was low, but higher in nLBBB, reflecting a partial adherence to the guidelines. We found no correlation between LBBB chronicity and MI. Furthermore, only a minority of the MIs occurred in patients with nLBBB. ST-concordance was found in only one of 36 MI cases, indicating lack of sensitivity for this test. © The European Society of Cardiology 2013.",Excluded

It ranks among other asthenic syndromes reflecting a specific character of exogenous radiation effect on the organism, being a result of a characteristic interaction between the organism and a health hazard. Measures to dispel the asthenic component at the initial stages of development of the disorder will make for reduction or arrest of progression of organic symptomatology.",Included

There were 124 males, with a mean age of 59 +/- 15 years and a mean follow-up of 7 +/- 4 years. Eighty-nine patients received radiotherapy with a mean total dose of 61.8 +/- 10.9 Gy., RESULTS: The 10-year disease-free and disease-specific survival was 58% and 72%, respectively. Radiation was not associated with local recurrence (hazard ratio [HR], 1.13; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.59-2.17; P = 0.71), metastases (HR, 0.93; 95% CI, 0.45-1.91; P = 0.85) or disease-specific survival (HR, 0.96; 95% CI, 0.46-2.00; P = 0.91). Higher doses (>=70 Gy; HR, 0.52; 95% CI, 0.20-1.32; P = 0.17) may be associated with reduced local recurrence. Radiotherapy was associated with wound complications (HR, 2.76; 95% CI, 1.64-4.82;, P < 0.001) and sacral stress fractures (HR, 4.73; 95% CI, 1.88-14.38; P < 0.001)., CONCLUSIONS: In this multicenter review, radiotherapy was not associated with tumor outcome but associated with complications. The routine use of radiotherapy with en-bloc resection of sacrococcygeal chordomas should be reconsidered in favor of a selective, individualized approach with a radiation dose of >=70 Gy.

X-ray computed microtomography is a non-invasive technique, which can be used to evaluate histomorphometric indices in trabecular bones (BV/TV, BS/BV, Tb.N, Tb.Th, Tb.Sp). In this technique, 3D images are used to quantify the whole sample, differently from the conventional one, in which the quantification is performed in 2D slices and extrapolated for 3D case. In this work, histomorphometric quantification using synchrotron 3D X-ray computed microtomography was performed to quantify the bone structure at different skeletal sites as well as to investigate the effects of bone diseases on quantitative understanding of bone architecture. The images were obtained at Synchrotron Radiation for MEdical Physics (SYRMEP) beamline, at ELETTRA synchrotron radiation facility, Italy. Concerning the obtained results for normal and pathological bones from same skeletal sites and individuals, from our results, a certain declining bone volume fraction was achieved. The results obtained could be used in forming the basis for comparison of the bone microarchitecture and can be a valuable tool for predicting bone fragility. Copyright © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

2946,"Developmental defects and male sterility in mice lacking the ubiquitin-like DNA repair gene mHR23B mHR23B encodes one of the two mammalian homologs of Saccharomyces cerevisiae RAD23, a ubiquitin-like fusion protein involved in nucleotide excision repair (NER). Part of mHR23B is complexed with the XPC protein, and this heterodimer functions as the main damage detector and initiator of global genome NER. While XPC defects exist in humans and mice, mutations for mHR23A and mHR23B are not known. Here, we present a mouse model for mHR23B. Unlike XPC-deficient cells, mHR23B(-/-) mouse embryonic fibroblasts are not UV sensitive and retain the repair characteristics of wild-type cells. In agreement with the results of in vitro repair studies, this indicates that mHR23A can functionally replace mHR23B in NER. Unexpectedly, mHR23B(-/-) mice show impaired embryonic development and a high rate (90%) of intrauterine or neonatal death. Surviving animals display a variety of abnormalities, including retarded growth, facial dysmorphology, and male sterility. Such abnormalities are not observed in XPC and other NER-deficient mouse mutants and point to a separate function of mHR23B in development. This function may involve regulation of protein stability via the ubiquitin/proteasome pathway and is not or only in part compensated for by mHR23A.",Excluded
2433,"Adjuvant external beam radiation for medullary thyroid carcinoma Background: Adjuvant radiation is rarely used to treat medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC). We hypothesized that external beam radiation therapy (EBRT) would improve overall survival (OS) in MTC patients. Method(s): The Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database identified patients who underwent total thyroidectomy and lymph nodes excision for MTC between 1988 and 2004. The Kaplan-Meier method was used for univariate comparisons of OS. Multivariate Cox proportional hazards models controlled for gender, age, lymph node status, tumor size, extent of disease, and EBRT. Result(s): After 12 years, EBRT did not significantly improve OS (log rank, P < 0.14). In node-positive patients, univariate analysis demonstrated an OS benefit with EBRT (log rank, P < 0.05). In a multivariate model of node-positive patients, only increasing age (P < 0.001) and tumor size (P < 0.001) significantly influenced OS. Conclusion(s): The OS benefit attributed to EBRT in node-positive patients by univariate analysis could not be duplicated when controlling for known prognostic factors. © 2010 Wiley-Liss, Inc.",Excluded
2532,"The benefits of psychosocial interventions for cancer patients undergoing radiotherapy Background: Many patients with cancer experience depression and anxiety, and an associated decrease in quality of life (QOL) during radiation therapy (RT). The main objective of the study was to determine the benefits of psychosocial interventions for cancer patients who received RT. Method(s): Patients with cancer (n = 178) who agreed to participate in the study were randomized to the intervention arm (n = 89) or the control arm (n = 89). Patients in the intervention group received psychosocial care during RT, whereas the control group received RT only. The benefits of the intervention were evaluated using the Zung Self-rating Depression Scale (SDS) to measure depression, the Self-rating Anxiety Scale (SAS) to assess anxiety, and the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire-Core 30 (EORTC QLQ-C30) to survey health-related QOL. The association between intervention and survival was also assessed. Result(s): Patients randomly assigned to the intervention arm showed significant improvements on symptoms of depression (p < 0.05) and anxiety (p < 0.05), health-related QOL (p < 0.05) (i.e. better global health status, and physical and emotional functioning, and less insomnia) when compared with controls. In the subset analysis, female patients, those that received high dose irradiation, and those that underwent adjuvant chemotherapy could benefit more from psychosocial intervention. There was no difference between the two groups in disease-free survival (DFS) (2-year DFS 79.8% in the intervention arm and 76.4% in the control arm; p = 0.527) and overall survival (OS) (2-year OS 83.1% in the intervention arm and 84.3% in the control arm; p = 0.925). Conclusion(s): Psychosocial intervention is a cost-effective approach that can improve a patient's mood and QOL both during and after RT. However, the intervention was not found to reduce the risk of cancer recurrence and death. © 2013 Guo et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",Excluded
2835,"[Hard x-ray therapy with special reference to postoperative irradiation of breast carcinoma] Five-year-experiences have shown that a considerably intensified tolerance of the skin and an absorption equability of tissues and bones and muscles are obtained with the hard ray roentgen irradiator, RT 305, for half-value depths from 20 mm to 70 mm H-2O and half-value thickness to about 7 mm Cu. By means of a rod anode tube of 300 kV with a super-normal filtration to 3.5 mm Pb, a hard and nearly monochromatic radiation, which already possesses the above mentioned advantages of the ultra-hard ray therapy with an effective energy about 0.2 MeV, appears. The application of this hard ray therapy is given preferably for disease foci in the environment of bone tissues, i.e. in the head and throat, the vertebral column, the osseous pelvic ring and the extremities and as the conventional roentgen therapy ist not able to give it. The hard ray therapy seems to be particularly adapted for the postoperative irradiation of the cancer of the breast with the ribs lying in the region of the irradiation fields, with the sternum and the bones of the shoulder girdle.

2853,"A phase II trial of stereotactic body radiation therapy for operable T1N0M0 non-small cell lung cancer: Japan clinical oncology group (JCOG0403) Purpose/Objective(s): Stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) is a rapidly prevailing treatment modality suggesting high effectiveness in the treatment of medically inoperable stage I non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). It has also been applied in operable stage I NSCLC patients, but the prospective data have not been available yet. The purpose of JCOG0403 was to evaluate the safety and efficacy of SBRT in patients with both operable and medically inoperable T1N0M0 NSCLC (UICC 6th ed., 2002), and this is the first report analyzed for operable population. Materials/Methods: The eligibility criteria included histologically or cytologically proven NSCLC, clinical T1N0M0, operable patients assessed by thoracic surgeons, PS 0-2, >= 20 years old, PaO2 >= 60 torr, FEV1.0>= 700 mL, and written informed consent. The prescription was 48 Gy at the isocenter in 4 fractions over 4-8 days. 4-10 MV X rays were allowed. Heterogeneity corrected doses by pencil beam algorithms were used. The GTV included the primary tumor only, CTV margin was not considered, and ITV margin and 5 mm setup margin were added. As a quality assurance program, credentialing of institutions and an individual case review using the Image-guided Therapy Center (ITC) remote review tool were performed. The primary endpoint was the three-year overall survival. The secondary endpoints included overall survival (OS), progression-free survival (PFS), local-progression free survival (LPFS), event-free survival (EFS), toxicity, and patterns of failure. The sample size was determined so that the 95% confidence interval for the estimated 3-year OS would be +/- 10% around expected value of 80%. Result(s): Between July 2004 and January 2007, 65 patientswere registered in this study from15 institutions.The patients characteristics were:male 45, female 20; median age 79 (range, 50-91);median tumor size 21mm(range, 10-30mm); adenocarcinomas 40, squamous cell carcinomas 21, others 4; and PS 0/1/2, 43/20/2. All patients completed the protocol treatment. At the last follow-up in November 2009, median follow-up of censored cases was 45.4 months. of the eligible 64 patients, the 3-year overall survival was 76.0% (95% CI: 63.3% - 84.8%). To date, a total of 25 progressions were observed, and the 3-year PFS, LPFS, and EFS were 54.5% (95% CI: 41.5% - 65.7%), 68.5% (95% CI: 55.5% -78.4%) and 51.4% (95% CI: 38.6% - 62.9%), respectively. Grade 3 toxicity was observed in chest pain 1 (1.5%), dyspnea 2 (3.1%), hypoxia 1 (1.5%), and pneumonitis 2 (3.1%). No grade 4 and 5 toxicity was observed. Conclusion(s): SBRT for operable stage I NSCLC is highly effective with mild toxicity. This treatment has a potential to be an alternative to surgery and should be considered as a treatment option especially in elderly patients.",Excluded
2730,"Less is More: The Impact of Multidisciplinary Thyroid Conference on the Treatment of Well-Differentiated Thyroid Carcinoma BACKGROUND: In 2006, a multidisciplinary thyroid conference (MDTC) was implemented to better plan management of thyroid cancer patients at our institution. This study assessed the clinical impact of a MDTC on radioactive iodine (RAI) treatment patterns., METHODS: A prospective database (2003-2014) collected patient and tumor characteristics, RAI doses, and tumor recurrences. Patients treated with total thyroidectomy for differentiated thyroid carcinoma >=1 cm were stratified based on American Thyroid Association (ATA) risk classification. RAI regimens were compared before initiation of MDTC (2003-2005, n = 88), after establishment of MDTC (2007-2009, n = 95), and after the release of 2009 ATA guidelines (2011-2014, n = 181). RAI doses were defined as low (<=75 mCi), intermediate (76-150 mCi), and high (>150 mCi)., RESULTS: There was a significant decrease in the number of patients who received high-dose RAI after implementation of MDTC compared to before initiation of MDTC in the intermediate and high-risk patient groups (p = 0.04 and p < 0.01) without an associated increase in tumor recurrence (11 vs. 7%, p = 0.74). On multivariable analysis, presentation of a patient at MDTC was a negative predictor for receiving high-dose RAI (p = 0.002). As might be expected, there was also a significant decrease in use of RAI after the 2009 ATA guidelines were issued compared to after implementation of MDTC (p < 0.01)., CONCLUSION: In conjunction with implementation of a thyroid malignancy multidisciplinary conference, we observed significantly decreased postoperative dosing of RAI without increased tumor recurrence. The 2009 ATA guidelines were associated with a further decrease in RAI administration. Treatment for patients with thyroid carcinoma is optimized by a multidisciplinary approach.",Excluded
3660,"Stereotactic radiosurgery for trigeminal neuralgia: a multiinstitutional study using the gamma unit A multiinstitutional study was conducted to evaluate the technique, dose-selection parameters, and results of gamma knife stereotactic radiosurgery in the management of trigeminal neuralgia. Fifty patients at five centers underwent radio-surgery performed with a single 4-mm isocenter targeted at the nerve root entry zone. Thirty-two patients had undergone prior surgery, and the mean number of procedures that had been performed was 2.8 (range 1-7). The target dose of the radiosurgery used in the current study varied from 60 to 90 Gy. The median follow-up period after radiosurgery was 18 months (range 11-36 months). Twenty-nine patients (58%) responded with excellent control (pain free), 18 (36%) obtained good control (50%-90% relief), and three (6%) experienced treatment failure. The median time to pain relief was 1 month (range 1 day-6.7 months). Responses remained consistent for up to 3 years postradiosurgery in all cases except three (6%) in which the patients had pain recurrence at 5, 7, and 10 months. At 2 years, 54% of patients were pain free and 88% had 50% to 100% relief. A maximum radiosurgical dose of 70 Gy or greater was associated with a significantly greater chance of complete pain relief (72% vs. 9%, p = 0.0003). Three patients (6%) developed increased facial paresthesia after radiosurgery, which resolved totally in one case and improved in another. No patient developed other deficits or deafferentation pain. The proximal trigeminal nerve and root entry zone, which is well defined on magnetic resonance imaging, is an appropriate anatomical target for radiosurgery. Radiosurgery using the gamma unit is an additional effective surgical approach for the management of medically or surgically refractory trigeminal neuralgia. A longer-term follow-up review is warranted.",Excluded
2580,"Clinical Outcomes of Image Guided Adaptive Hypofractionated Weekly Radiation Therapy for Bladder Cancer in Patients Unsuitable for Radical Treatment Purpose and Objectives We report on the clinical outcomes of a phase 2 study assessing image guided hypofractionated weekly radiation therapy in bladder cancer patients unsuitable for radical treatment. Methods and Materials Fifty-five patients with T2-T4aNx-2M0-1 bladder cancer not suitable for cystectomy or daily radiation therapy treatment were recruited. A ""plan of the day"" radiation therapy approach was used, treating the whole (empty) bladder to 36 Gy in 6 weekly fractions. Acute toxicity was assessed weekly during radiation therapy, at 6 and 12 weeks using the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events version 3.0. Late toxicity was assessed at 6 months and 12 months using Radiation Therapy Oncology Group grading. Cystoscopy was used to assess local control at 3 months. Cumulative incidence function was used to determine local progression at 1 at 2 years. Death without local progression was treated as a competing risk. Overall survival was estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method. Results Median age was 86 years (range, 68-97 years). Eighty-seven percent of patients completed their prescribed course of radiation therapy. Genitourinary and gastrointestinal grade 3 acute toxicity was seen in 18% (10/55) and 4% (2/55) of patients, respectively. No grade 4 genitourinary or gastrointestinal toxicity was seen. Grade >=3 late toxicity (any) at 6 and 12 months was seen in 6.5% (2/31) and 4.3% (1/23) of patients, respectively. Local control after radiation therapy was 92% of assessed patients (60% total population). Cumulative incidence of local progression at 1 year and 2 years for all patients was 7% (95% confidence interval [CI] 2%-17%) and 17% (95% CI 8%-29%), respectively. Overall survival at 1 year was 63% (95% CI 48%-74%). Conclusion Hypofractionated radiation therapy delivered weekly with a plan of the day approach offers good local control with acceptable toxicity in a patient population not suitable for radical bladder treatment.Copyright © 2017 The Author(s)",Excluded
2070,"Dysfunctional Lens Index Serves as a Novel Surgery Decision-Maker for Age-Related Nuclear Cataracts Purpose: To study the correlations between subjective and objective cataract metrics with dysfunctional lens index. To investigate the potential of the DLI as a novel surgery decision-maker. Methods: In this prospective, cross-sectional study, we measured the dysfunctional lens index (DLI), Lens Opacities Classification System III nuclear opalescence (LOCS III NO) grading, preoperative corrected distance visual acuity (CDVA), objective scatter index (OSI) and Scheimpflug-based average lens density (ALD) in eyes with nuclear cataract. Eyes were classified as Surgical and Non-Surgical groups. Correlations among the DLI, OSI, ALD, LOCS III NO grading, and preoperative CDVA were analyzed. The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis was performed for DLI, OSI, and CDVA to determine optimal cut-off values to separate between surgical and non-surgical cataracts. Results: The DLI showed the strongest correlation with the OSI (r= -0.712, P< .001), followed by LOCS III NO score (r= -0.661, P< .001), ALD (r= -0.596, P< .001) and preoperative CDVA (r= 0.563, P< .001). The area under ROC curves (AUCs) of the DLI, OSI and preoperative CDVA curve were 0.972, 0.912 and 0.844 (All P< .001), respectively. The DLI cut-off value of 5.7 implied higher levels of sensitivity (91.67%) and specificity (91.84%) than the OSI cut-off value of 2.9 and the CDVA cut-off value of 0.55 (sensitivity of 89.58% and 71.92%; specificity of 81.63% and 85.71%, respectively). Conclusion: The surgery criterion of DLI <= 5.7 behaved better than the surgery criterions of OSI >= 2.9 and preoperative CDVA <= 0.55 in discrimination between surgical and non-surgical nuclear cataracts.",Excluded

Method(s): We retrospectively reviewed 50 patients with homogenous, arch-shaped calcifying tendinitis, suffering from chronic pain and who underwent arthroscopic treatment and 50 patients with the same type of tendinitis treated conservatively. All patients had calcium deposit located in supraspinatus tendon, pre-operatively and post-operatively evaluated by ultrasound. Clinical outcome was assessed by using Quick DASH, UCLA, and VAS score. Result(s): There were 29 male and 71 female patients; none had bilateral involvement. We divided patients into group A-operatively treated-and group B-conservatively treated-by shock wave therapy. Patients from group A had higher improvement of all used tests, QDash (from 19.3 to 2.7), UCLA (from 10 to 34), and VAS score (from 3 to 0) when compared with group B. Conclusion(s): Patients with arch-shaped calcium deposits and acoustic shadow have better results after arthroscopic treatment than the conservative one. There was no need for acromioplasty or tendon repair. The lack of performing the same did not have any impact on the post-operative rehabilitation and recovery.Copyright © 2021, SICOT aisbl.",Excluded

3663,"Defining disease progression in Chinese mainland people: Association between bone mineral density and knee osteoarthritis Objective: To evaluate change in bone mineral density (BMD) during development of knee osteoarthritis (OA) in elderly Chinese community residents. Further, to monitor disease progression by recording speed of sound (SOS), one parameter of BMD provided by quantitative ultrasound measurement. Method(s): A total of 4173 community residents of the Chinese mainland were organized to complete questionnaires and relevant measurements, including anthropometry, radiology and quantitative ultrasound (QUS). SOS measurements of the distal radius were acquired using QUS measurements. The Kellgren-Lawrence (KL) grade of knee OA was evaluated by two experienced radiographers using X-rays. Finally, a general linear models analysis was performed to determine potential relationships. Further, the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC AUC) was applied to assess the distinction model. Result(s): The SOS score in the OA group was significantly lower than that in the control group (p < 0.001). However, after adjustment for age and body mass index (BMI), no significant difference was observed in the male population (p = 0.841), while a significantly lower SOS score presented in knee OA participants in the female population (p = 0.033). A turning point in SOS scores, from increasing to decreasing trends, occurred around KL grade 2; the SOS score gradually increased with progression in participants from KL grades 0 to 2, whereas the SOS score presented a significant decrease in participants with KL grades 3 and 4. The AUC for the model to distinguish OA progression was 0.891. Conclusion(s): There was a non-linear and stage-specific association between SOS score and knee OA, which presented a positive relationship in early stages, but a negative relationship in advanced stages. A decline of SOS score in knee OA patients in early stages should alert clinicians to the possibility of disease progression. The Translational potential of this article: In the present study, the relationship between OA and BMD had established by SOS. The results suggested that close monitoring of SOS in elderly Chinese communities residents with knee OA could alert disease progression involvement by an easily accessible method, and help early referral to orthopedist consultation for further examination and treatment.Copyright © 2020 The Author(s)",Excluded

Cellular immunity was assessed on the basis of PHA-induced blastogenic reaction of lymphocytes (BRL) and spontaneous rosette-formation. In rectal tumor patients, particularly at stage IV, the level of PHA-induced BRL and the total number of rosette-forming cells (RFC) were lower than in healthy donors. Surgery did not produce any significant changes in cell-mediated immunity parameters: level of PHA-induced BRL decreased by 16,7%, while total RFC number increased by 17.2% in (mostly low-affinity forms). Preoperative radiation resulted in a significant decrease in lymphocyte ability to undergo PHA-induced blast-transformation (45%) and spontaneous rosette formation, high-affinity lymphocytes being most sensitive to ionizing radiation.

726,"Photochemical repair of Achilles tendon rupture in a rat model Background. Photochemical tissue bonding (PTB) is an emerging technique for bonding or sealing tissue surfaces that requires light and a photoactive dye for its effect. The potential of PTB for tendon repair was assessed in a rat model. Materials and methods. The optical properties of bovine tendon were determined ex vivo to gauge the depth of light penetration as a function of wavelength and dosimetry parameters were established for PTB repair of ruptured tendon. PTB was then tested in vivo to repair transected tendons in Sprague-Dawley rats. Repair strengths were measured using a strain gauge up to 14 days post treatment. Results. The effective penetration depth in tendon was estimated to be 0.68 mm at 514 nm. Following PTB treatment of mechanically ruptured tendon, significant bonding was dependent on the presence of both light and dye and attained a plateau strength at a fluence of 125 J/cm2. In a subsequent in vivo study to investigate PTB for repair of transected rat Achilles tendon, the ultimate stress required to break the repaired tendon was measured immediately after irradiation and at 7 and 14 days post-repair. Results showed that the difference in the ultimate stress between control and PTB treatment groups was statistically significant immediately after treatment and at 7 days (p = 0.04) but not 14 days (p = 0.75) post-repair.

Iterative reconstruction was used in all patients. For image quality assessment, CTA images were evaluated on a three-point scale and signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR) were calculated and compared. Furthermore, computed tomography (CT) dose index was recorded., RESULTS: Mean CT values and noise levels were higher in group A compared to group B (all P < .001), whereas SNR and CNR were lower than those in group B (all P < .001). Furthermore, the image quality of the aorta at the level of the diaphragm was lower in group A than that in group B (P < .05). However, image quality was graded as diagnostic in all patients, and motion artifacts of the aortic arch were significantly decreased in group A (P <.05). Interreader agreement was good or excellent for image quality assessment (k = 0.625-0.835). The 70-kVp CTA protocol, which allows dose reduction of 85%, was considered diagnostic in all instances by two readers., CONCLUSIONS: Our proposed thoracic aortic CTA protocol provides diagnostic information with substantial reduction of both radiation and contrast agent doses compared to standard-pitch CTA at 100 kVp.

2544,"Human mononuclear cell in vitro activation in microgravity and post-spaceflight The results of postflight and inflight human in vitro lymphocyte experiments have been reviewed. The cumulative data indicate that mitogen-stimulated T-cell proliferation is blunted following short-duration missions. Since similar responses may also be obtained following exposure to non-spaceflight stressors (hypoxia and academic stress), it is unclear if microgravity per se aggravates this response. Our studies indicate that stress-induced impaired PHA- and PWM-stimulated activation can be detected within the first 24 hours in culture at the level of protein synthesis. While the mechanism for neuroendocrine-mediated blunted mitogen stimulated T cell proliferation has not been elucidated, it is not aggravated by autologous plasma and does not require changes in mononuclear cell subpopulations. While prior studies indicate lymphocyte activation is influenced by altering G forces on in vitro cultures, impaired cellular interactions or suboptimal microenvironments related to reduced cell densities in microgravity may contribute to the greatly impaired mitogen stimulated proliferation responses observed on Spacelab flights. It will be necessary to perform lymphocyte functional assays on crewmembers during spaceflight to determine to contribution of microgravity per se on altered human immune competence.",Excluded
387,"18F-sodium fluoride pet bone scans Background Information: 18 F-fluoride is a bone seeking positron emitting tracer with high sensitivity and specificity for detection of osseous lesions, and in particular osteolytic lesions. It is characterized by rapid localization and clearance from the circulation with twice the skeletal uptake and better target to background ratio as compared with the conventional 99m Tc-MDP (methyl diphosphonate) bone scan agent. Additionally, 18 F-flouride PET/CT scans provide higher spatial resolution, shorter imaging time, and slightly less radiation. Furthermore, attenuation correction using CT provides better characterization of morphology and therefore increased accuracy. An analysis of 11 cases of 18 F-fluoride PET bone scans performed between June 2009 and July 2010 demonstrated accurate characterization and localization of osseous lesions as well as nonosseous metastatic lesions. The study population consisted of seven male and four female patients between the ages of 48-68 years with primary cancers of the prostate, kidney, colon, breast, bladder, lung, and the adrenal gland. The administered dose ranged from 7.7-13.6 mCi. Eight out of eleven scans were positive for metastatic disease and three were negative. All findings were correlated with CT. Early detection of bone metastases is significant in therapy planning and monitoring. Accurate demonstration of osseous metastases helps improve patient care and patient outcome. We believe 18 F-fluoride PET/CT can provide more thorough and conclusive evaluation of bone disease than the conventional 99m Tc-MDP. Educational Goals/Teaching Points: Overview of physiology, dosimetry, and clinical advantages of 18 F-NaF bone imaging compared with conventional Tc-MDP bone imaging. Key Anatomic/Physiologic Issues and Imaging Findings/Techniques: Role of 18 F-NaF PET imaging in detection of malignant and benign osseous disease.

3599,"Low dose IR-induced IGF-1-sCLU expression: a p53-repressed expression cascade that interferes with TGFbeta1 signaling to confer a pro-survival bystander effect Inadvertent mammalian tissue exposures to low doses of ionizing radiation (IR) after radiation accidents, remediation of radioactive-contaminated areas, space travel or a dirty bomb represent an interesting trauma to an organism. Possible low-dose IR-induced bystander effects could impact our evaluation of human health effects, as cells within tissue are not equally damaged after doses of IR <=10 cGy. To understand tissue responses after low IR doses, we generated a reporter system using the human clusterin promoter fused to firefly luciferase (hCLUp-Luc). Secretory clusterin (sCLU), an extracellular molecular chaperone, induced by low doses of cytotoxic agents, clears cell debris. Low-dose IR (>=2 cGy) exposure induced hCLUp-Luc activity with peak levels at 96 h, consistent with endogenous sCLU levels. As doses increased (>=1 Gy), sCLU induction amplitudes increased and time-to-peak response decreased. sCLU expression was stimulated by insulin-like growth factor-1, but suppressed by p53. Responses in transgenic hCLUp-Luc reporter mice after low IR doses showed that specific tissues (that is, colon, spleen, mammary, thymus and bone marrow) of female mice induced hCLUp-Luc activity more than male mice after whole body (>=10 cGy) irradiation. Tissue-specific, non-linear dose- and time-responses of hCLUp-Luc and endogenous sCLU levels were noted. Colon maintained homeostatic balance after 10 cGy. Bone marrow responded with delayed, but prolonged and elevated expression. Intraperitoneal administration of alpha-transforming growth factor (TGF)beta1 (1D11), but not control (13C4) antibodies, immediately following IR exposure abrogated CLU induction responses. Induction in vivo also correlated with Smad signaling by activated TGFbeta1 after IR. Mechanistically, media with elevated sCLU levels suppressed signaling, blocked apoptosis and increased survival of TGFbeta1-exposed tumor or normal cells. Thus, sCLU is a pro-survival bystander factor that abrogates TGFbeta1 signaling and most likely promotes wound healing.",Included
429,"Evaluation of the ECAT EXACT HR+ 3-D PET scanner in H2(15)O brain activation studies: dose fractionation strategies for rCBF and signal enhancing protocols We evaluated the performance of the ECAT EXACT HR+ 3-D whole-body positron emission tomography (PET) scanner when employed to measure brain function using H2(15)O bolus activation protocols that are completed in single same-day data acquisition sessions. Using vibrotactile and auditory stimuli as independent activation tasks, we studied the scanner performance under different imaging conditions in five healthy volunteers. Cerebral blood flow images were acquired from each volunteer using H2(15)O bolus injections of activity varying from 5-20 mCi. One-session dose-fractionation strategies were analyzed for rCBF, standard activity-concentration, switched, and cold-bolus/switched protocols. Performance characteristics. The scanner dead time grew linearly with injected dose from 10% to 25%. Random events varied from 30% to 50% of the detected events. Random and scattered events were corrected adequately at all doses. Estimated noise-effective-count curves plateau at about 10 mCi. One-session 12-injection bolus PET activation protocols. Using an acquisition protocol that accounts for the scanner performance and the practical aspects of imaging volunteers and neurological patients in a single same-day session, we assessed the correlation between the significance of activation foci and the dose/injection used. The one-session protocol employs 12 bolus injections/subject. We present evidence suggesting that when an rCBF protocol is used, image noise is reduced significantly when the activity injected increases from 5 to 10 mCi. Increasing the dose from 10 to 15 or 20 mCi yielded further but smaller reductions. Our observations also suggest that image noise will be strongly reduced if a 20-mCi dose/injection is used when data are collected using protocols that employ long acquisition times such as a switched or a cold-bolus/switched protocol.",Excluded
2922,"Is it necessary to approach the severe osteoporotic vertebral biconcave-shaped fracture bilaterally during the process of pkp? Purpose: The goal of this study was to explore the outcomes of unilateral and bilateral approach percutaneous kyphoplasty (PKP) using CT-guidance in the treatment of severe osteoporotic single-level vertebral biconcave-shaped fracture. Method(s): We retrospectively reviewed 89 patients with severe osteoporotic single-level vertebral biconcave-shaped fracture who had undergone unilateral and bilateral PKP surgeries using CT-guidance at our hospital between June 2013 and June 2019, and followed for at least 1 year. All patients were divided into unilateral (the transverse process-pedicle approach, n = 49) and bilateral (the pedicle approach, n = 40) groups. We collected the clinical and radiological evaluation results during postoperative and last follow-up periods. Result(s): Our findings revealed that the surgery time for the unilateral group was significantly shorter than that of the bilateral group at P < 0.05. The amount of bone cement and radiation exposure of the unilateral group were significantly lesser than that of the bilateral group (P < 0.05). Relative to preoperative data, the values of the VAS score and Oswestry disability index (ODI) were significantly improved at 1 day after surgery and the last followup in the two groups (P < 0.05). Notably, the median height of vertebra at 1 day after surgery and the last follow-up in the unilateral group was significantly restored than that of preoperative data (P < 0.05). However, the median height of vertebra at the same time intervals in the bilateral group showed no significant change compared with preoperative data (P > 0.05). Furthermore, the rate of bone cement leakage and incidence of adjacent-level vertebra fracture were not significantly different in the two groups (P > 0.05). Finally, both groups can obtain an asymmetrical distribution of bone cement in the vertebra. Conclusion(s): Compared to the bilateral PKP, unilateral PKP using CT-guidance in the treatment of the sOVBFs exhibits significantly shorter operation time, lesser radiation dose, and complications. Moreover, unilateral PKP can restore the median height of the vertebral body and eventually obtain a symmetrical distribution of bone cement in the vertebra.Copyright © 2021 Tan et al.",Excluded

Two hundred patients were prospectively selected. Of these, 100 were subjected to percutaneous procedure with the use of Sirio and 100 to traditional CT-guided percutaneous procedure. The two methods were compared in terms of absorbed dose, procedure time, complications, and number of non-diagnostic specimens (diagnostic success)., RESULTS: Sirio has shown a significant reduction in the absorbed dose and procedure times (p < 0.05), with a lower incidence of complications compared to the traditional procedure. Sirio has also allowed to carry out biopsies of lesions' diameter <=10 mm, obtaining fewer non diagnostic specimens thus resulting more effective in terms of diagnostic success., CONCLUSIONS: The use of Sirio in sampling biopsy showed a statistically significant reduction in terms of performed scans and procedural time with lower incidence of post-procedural complications compared to the traditional percutaneous procedure, especially for lesions <=10 mm. The best diagnostic result, the reduction of the dose absorbed and procedural complications makes the procedures more reliable, safety and less invasive. In addition, the reduction of execution time will increase the number of daily interventional procedures improving clinical management.",Excluded

Treatment for RI remains a challenge. We conducted this study to investigate the indications of neurosurgery, operation time and prognosis of patients with RI after NPC radiotherapy who underwent neurosurgical management. Method(s): This was a follow-up study between January 2005 and July 2011. Fifteen NPC cases of RI who underwent neurosurgery were collected. Brain Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), surgery and histology were studied. The outcome was assessed by LENT/SOMA scales and modified Rankin scale. Result(s): Brain lesion resection (86.7%) was more common than decompressive craniotomy (13.3%). According to LENT/SOMA scale before and six months after surgery, 13 of 15, 12 of 15, 14 of 15, and 14 of 15 cases showed improvement at subjective, objective, management and analytic domains, respectively. 12 of 15 patients showed improvement of modified Rankin scale after surgery. Three patients who underwent emergency surgery showed significant improvement (average score increment of 2, 2.7, 2.7, 3 and 2 at LENT/SOMA scale subjective, objective, management, analytic, and modified Rankin scale, respectively), as compared with 12 cases underwent elective surgery (average score increment of 1, 1, 1.4, 1.8 and 1 at LENT SOMA scale subjective, objective, management, analytic, and modified Rankin scale, respectively). Conclusion(s): Neurosurgery, including brain necrotic tissue resection and decompressive craniotomy, improves the prognosis for RI patients, especially for those with indications of emergency surgery. © 2013 Li et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",Excluded

1098,"Patient radiation exposure during diagnostic and therapeutic interventional neuroradiology procedures PURPOSE: Increasing in number and complexity, interventional neuroradiology (INR) procedures are becoming an important source of radiation exposure for patients. In accordance with the ALARA principle, radiation exposure during INR procedures should be curtailed as much as possible while reaching successful treatment outcomes. Moreover, the extent of radiation exposure should be one outcome measure used to assess new technologies and procedural efficacy, and training programs should include techniques for exposure limitation. This study provides a methodology and preliminary data to assess radiation exposure during different INR procedure types., MATERIALS AND METHODS: All patients undergoing endovascular procedures in two biplanar dedicated neuroangiography suites at a major academic medical center were monitored according to procedure type, pathological indication, fluoroscopy time and machine-generated patient dose estimates between April 2006 and July 2008., RESULTS: 1678 patients underwent cerebral arteriography during the study period. Women (62.1%) accounted for the majority of patients, but men (38.9%) were more likely to undergo an interventional procedure than women (32.8%). Diagnostic studies accounted for 64.9% of procedures. Variable exposures were found between diagnostic and interventional procedures. Exposure differed depending on indications for the procedure and procedure type., CONCLUSION: Radiation exposure is an increasingly important consideration in the development of minimally invasive neurological procedures including cerebral angiography and INR. The type of procedure and lesion type allow the practitioner to estimate radiation exposure. Such information informs the clinical decision making process. Normative data should be collected and used for comparison purposes as one measure of technical and procedural success.",Excluded

Objective(s): The purpose of this study was to evaluate the impact of simulator training on trainees' performance in electrophysiologic catheter placement during the early phase of their learning curve. Method(s): Inexperienced electrophysiology fellows were considered. A hybrid high-fidelity simulator (Procedicus VIST, version 7.0, Mentice AB Gothenburg, Sweden for Biosense Webster) was used. The following parameters were evaluated in 3 consecutive patient-based procedures before and after two training sessions of at least 1.5 hours on the simulator: (1) ability to place catheters in conventional recording/pacing sites (coronary sinus, His-bundle area, high right atrium, and right ventricular apex); (2) amount of help provided by the supervisor (scale from 1-3; 3 for maximal help); (3) fluoroscopy time; and (4) positioning time. Result(s): Seven fellows performed 168 catheter placements during 42 patient-based procedures with no complications. Comparing parameters before and after simulator training, there was a significant reduction in the mean amount of help and in fluoroscopy and positioning times per placement: from 1.71 +/- 1.24 to 0.42 +/- 0.68 (P <.001), from 121 +/- 88 seconds to 76 +/- 54 seconds (P <.001), and from 175 +/- 138 seconds to 102 +/- 74 seconds (P <.001), respectively. Overall fluoroscopy time per patient decreased from 567 +/- 220 seconds to 305 +/- 111 seconds (P <.0001). Improvement appeared to be related to simulator training alone and not to the previously performed patient-based procedures. Conclusion(s): During the early phase of the trainees' learning curve, simulator training significantly improves the independent trainees' performance with reduction in radiation exposure. © 2012 Heart Rhythm Society.

3108,"Additional myeloablation with 52Fe before bone marrow transplantation For many hematological malignancies, high-dose chemoradiotherapy followed by bone marrow transplantation offers the best and sometimes the only chance for cure. However, the main causes of failure of this therapy are relapse and toxicity. In order to selectively deliver higher doses of radiotherapy to the bone marrow and to spare normal organs, we explored 52Fe therapy before a conventional BMT conditioning regimen. Twenty-four patients at high risk for relapse after BMT were included in a phase II study. The median follow-up was 42 months. The median 52Fe dose was 59 mCi. This resulted in a median radiation-absorbed dose (RAD) to the BM of 626 rad. The median RAD to the liver was 338 rad. No untoward effects were noted after the injections of 52Fe. The patients recovered hematopoiesis without toxicity in excess of that expected with conventional conditioning alone. The 3-year DFS probability was 49% (95% CI: 20-78%), Eight patients have relapsed,three of them in extramedullary sites. 52Fe should provide a way to boost the radiation dose to marrow-based diseases before bone marrow transplantation without excessive toxicity.",Excluded
361,"Late side effects of radioactive iodine on salivary gland function in patients with thyroid cancer BACKGROUND: The purpose of this study was to assess the late side effects of radioiodine therapy (RIT) on salivary gland function. One hundred eighty two patients were evaluated., METHODS: Assessment of salivary gland function was performed with salivary gland scintigraphy (SGS), sialometry, and subjective open questions to determine common side effects of RIT on salivary gland function., RESULTS: RIT had a strong association with decreased elimination counts by SGS. Patient age was the only variable associated with sialometry; age and the use of xerostomic drugs were strongly associated with decreased mean values of salivary flow. Dysphagia was strongly associated with RIT. Using multiple logistic regression analysis, age was determined to be an important factor associated with salivary gland dysfunction, and RIT was associated with impairment of saliva excretion., CONCLUSION: These results show that patients subjected to RIT have more difficulty in draining saliva, mainly from the parotid glands, which is associated with clinical dysphagia in this subset of patients.

1500,"Corticofugal modulation of the tactile response coherence of projecting neurons in the gracilis nucleus Precise and reproducible spike timing is one of the alternatives of the sensory stimulus encoding. We test coherence (repeatability) of the response patterns elicited in projecting gracile neurons by tactile stimulation and its modulation provoked by electrical stimulation of the corticofugal feedback from the somatosensory (SI) cortex. To gain the temporal structure we adopt the wavelet-based approach for quantification of the functional stimulus-neural response coupling. We show that the spontaneous firing patterns (when they exist) are essentially random. Tactile stimulation of the neuron receptive field strongly increases the spectral power in the stimulus and 5- to 15-Hz frequency bands. However, the functional coupling (coherence) between the sensory stimulus and the neural response exhibits ultraslow oscillation (0.07 Hz). During this oscillation the stimulus coherence can temporarily fall below the statistically significant level, i.e., the functional stimulus-response coupling may be temporarily lost for a single neuron. We further demonstrate that electrical stimulation of the SI cortex increases the stimulus coherence for about 60% of cells. We find no significant correlation between the increment of the firing rate and the stimulus coherence, but we show that there is a positive correlation with the amplitude of the peristimulus time histogram. The latter argues that the observed facilitation of the neural response by the corticofugal pathway, at least in part, may be mediated through an appropriate ordering of the stimulus-evoked firing pattern, and the coherence enhancement is more relevant in gracilis nucleus than an increase of the number of spikes elicited by the tactile stimulus.",Excluded

Method(s): There were 25 patients-22 (88%) men and 3 (12%) women (60+/-13 years) with decompensated CHF recruited for the study. All patients underwent following examinations: medical history, physical examination, laboratory tests (repeated on the lung function tests day), 12-leads electrocardiogram, X-ray, echocardiogram. The spirometry and body plethysmography were performed after patient's clinical haemodynamic stabilization. The following lung function tests parameters were taken into analysis: forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1), Tiffeneau ratio -FEV1 %VCmax (Maximal Vital Capacity), total lung capacity (TLC), vital capacity (VC), total airway resistance (Rtot). All examinations were repeated 3 months after the discharge. The median follow-up was 61 months. The Student's t-test or Mann-Whitney-U test, chi2 test and Pearson correlation were used for the initial statistical analysis. Result(s): The ejection fraction (EF) <=35% (21,1%+/-7,42) was confirmed in all patients on admission and 3 months after the discharge (23,3+/-8%, p=0,05). The elevated BNP level (2131,3+/-1096,8 pg/ml) was revealed in all patients on admission. Both BNP levels after stabilization (1192,4+/-1070,8 pg/ml) and 3 months after the discharge (745,7+/-635pg/ml) were lower than initial (p<0,0001). The spirometry revealed obstructive disorders in 20 patients (80%) at the discharge and 3 months later. The body plethysmography confirmed restrictive disorders in 2 patients (8%) at the discharge. We revealed the significant correlations between FEV1%VCmax and the highest BNP level (r=-0,45, p=0,027 ) and BNP level on lung function tests day (r=-0,44, p=0,03). We also found negative relationships between: EF and FEV1 (r=-0,41, p=0,04), EF and TLC (r=-0,59, p=0,007), EF and FEV1 measured 3 months after the discharge (r=-0,45, p=0,04).

Twenty-seven patients (nine men, 18 women; mean age, 64 years) with 23 solitary pancreatic tumors underwent dual-energy CT. Two imaging protocols were used: 140 kVp and 385 mA (protocol A) and 80 kVp and 675 mA (protocol B). For both protocols, the following variables were compared during the pancreatic parenchymal phase: contrast enhancement for the aorta, the pancreas, and the portal vein; pancreas-to-tumor contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR); noise; and effective dose. Two blinded, independent readers qualitatively scored the two data sets for tumor detection and image quality. Random-effect analysis of variance tests were used to compare differences between the two protocols., RESULTS: Compared with protocol A, protocol B yielded significantly higher contrast enhancement for the aorta (508.6 HU vs 221.5 HU, respectively), pancreas (151.2 HU vs 67.0 HU), and portal vein (189.7 HU vs 87.3 HU), along with a greater pancreas-to-tumor CNR (8.1 vs 5.9) (P < .001 for all comparisons). No statistically significant difference in tumor detection was observed between the two protocols. Although standard deviation of image noise increased with protocol B (11.5 HU vs 18.6 HU), this protocol significantly reduced the effective dose (from 18.5 to 5.1 mSv; P < .001)., CONCLUSION: A low-tube-voltage, high-tube-current CT technique has the potential to improve the enhancement of the pancreas and peripancreatic vasculature, improve tumor conspicuity, and reduce patient radiation dose during the pancreatic parenchymal phase.",Excluded

Material and Methods. The study included 44,041 employees of the SC, of whom 16,938 were occupationally exposed to prolonged low-intensity ionizing radiation (IR). Of 295 cases with hemoblastoses, there were 89 with occupational exposure to IR. The structure and incidence of hemoblastoses (based on the number of person-years of observation, (PYO), as well as the standardized relative risk (SRR) of their development and excess relative risk (ERR) per unit dose of radiation (Gr) were evaluated. Calculation of SRR was carried out for the following intervals of the total dose of external exposure: 0; >0-0.05; >0.05-0.10; >0.10-0.15; >0.15-0.20; >0.20-0.30; >0.30-0.50; >0.5-1.0; >= 1.0 G y. The control group consisted of occupationally non-exposed employees of the SC. The calculation of SRR and ERR was performed using the Poisson regression using the AM FIT module of the EPICU RE package. Results. The incidence of MNLT among males of SC was 17.1 per 100,000 P YO, with the highest incidence rates for Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL), chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CL) and chronic leukemia (CL) excluding CL. Among females of the SC, the incidence of MNLT was 21.3 per 100,000 PYO. It was found that in none of the intervals of the external exposure there was no statistically significant excess of the SRR compared with the control group. The results of ERR/Gy calculation also did not demonstrate the increased risk of hemoblastosis among people occupationally exposed to IR. Conclusion. Occupational exposure in the studied dose range does not increase the risk of developing MNLT.Copyright © 2020, Tomsk National Research Medical Center of the Russian Academy of Sciences.

Method(s): Patients undergone in the last year PCI of unprotected LMCA and scheduled for conventional X-ray coronary angiography were prospectively evaluated with stress perfusion CMR within 2 weeks before coronary angiography. Main contraindications to CMR and previous coronary artery bypass were exclusion criteria. Stress perfusion CMR was performed to follow a bolus of contrast Gadobutrol, after 3 min of adenosine infusion. Result(s): Between the 50 patients enrolled, only 1 did not finish the CMR protocol and 49 patients with median age 71 (65-75) years (38 male, 11 female) were analyzed. Previous myocardial infarction was present in 31 patients (63%) and multi vessel PCI in 39 (76%). We evaluated 784 coronary angiographic segments and found 75 stenosis or occlusions (prevalence 9.5%), but only 13 stenosis or occlusions in proximal segments (prevalence 6.6%). Patients with coronary stenosis (n=12, 24%) showed a significantly (p=0.002) higher prevalence of diabetes (7 of 12, 58%), while the other main clinical characteristics were similar to patients without coronary stenosis (all p>0.1). At CMR examination, late gadolinium enhancement was present in 25 (51%), reversible perfusion defects in 12 (24%), and fixed perfusion defects in 6 subjects (12%). The only patient with LMCA ristenosis resulted positive at perfusion CMR (Figure 1). CMR stress perfusion resulted positive in 8 of 12 patients with significant coronary lesions (sensitivity 67%, CI 35-90%) and in 4 of 5 patients with significant proximal coronary lesions (sensitivity 80%, CI 28-99). The accuracy of stress perfusion CMR in diagnosis of coronary stenosis was higher when the analysis was performed only in proximal coronary arteries (95%, CI 86-99) compared to overall vessels (84%, CI70-92). Conclusion(s): Stress perfusion CMR could strongly reduce the need for elective coronary angiography in follow up of LMCA PCI and should be validated in further multi center prospective studies.

1437,"A prospective assessment of radiotherapy (RT)- Induced early functional renal changes by means of 23Na-Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) Purpose: Radiation-induced renal damage is an important side effect for patients with long-term survival after abdominal RT. Time course of post-RT functional and morphological renal changes is unknown. MRI with 23Na imaging is a novel technique which provides functional kidney assessment. In a previous analysis, for long-term survivors of gastric cancer, late radiation induced changes in the kidney regions exposed to high doses but no alterations in regions exposed to intermediate/low doses were observed. Morphological and functional assessment in the acute post-RT phase in comparison to baseline values are missing. The purpose of this prospective study was to investigate kidney alterations and to correlate them to focal renal radiation doses before and early after abdominal RT. Patients/Methods: 3 pats without any known pre-RT kidney disease who were to undergo RT for abdominal sarcoma and B-NHL, respectively, were examined on a 3.0T scanner before and 2-6 weeks post-RT. In addition to T1- and T2w morphological sequences, 23Na images were obtained using a dedicated 23Na-tuned coil. The planning CT and the associated local radiation isodoses were deformably matched to the morphological MRI sequences with the software ""Velocity"" (Varian). Kidney regions exposed to radiation doses 5Gy, 20 Gy and 40Gy were identified and mean 23Na signal gradient along the cortico-medullary gradient and gradient slope were measured in these regions separately. Result(s): Mean relative 23Na signal of the cortico-medullary gradient and gradient slope matched with values of healthy volunteers in the pre-RT examination. All results are summarised in Table 1. In the first post-RT MRI, morphological sequences (T1 and T2w) did not show any changes. In kidney regions with doses below 20Gy, no changes in the 23Na-gradient slope were observed. For regions with doses of 40Gy and beyond, a functional result was observed that was different from the low dose regions: The slope of the 23Na cortico-medullary gradient in the high-dose regions was markedly reduced in the post-RT MRI when compared to the pre-RT MRI. (Table Presented) Average slope (in arbitrary units/pixel along the cortico-medullary axis) pre and post RT for different dose regions. A marked decrease in average slope is found for the 40Gy regions, whereas the slope of the cortico-medullary 23Na gradient remains high in areas receiving 20Gy or less. Conclusion(s): 2-6 weeks post RT, marked functional effects were observed in high-dose areas while no alteration in kidney function was observed in low dose areas (20Gy), indicating the value of functional MR imaging in the early assessment and characterisation of the chronological course of radiogenic nephrotoxicity.",Excluded

It is a deep heating procedure of limited range with low-level exposure to the subcutaneous fatty tissue; it may be used in subacute and chronic infectious inflammatory conditions, after surgical interventions, in affections of the salivary glands and of the maxillary sinuses, and also in temporo-mandibular joint disorders and facial neuralgias. As a rule, irradiation by microwaves is only a supporting treatment. Its advantages are above all: easy application; great economy; versatility; uniform, locally limited distribution of heat with low-level exposure to the fatty tissue; virtual safety.",Excluded
3204,"Comparison of two new angiogenesis PET tracers 68Ga-NODAGA-E[c(RGDyK)]2 and 64Cu-NODAGA-E[c(RGDyK)]2; in vivo imaging studies in human xenograft tumors Introduction: The aim of this study was to synthesize and perform a side-by-side comparison of two new tumor-angiogenesis PET tracers 68Ga-NODAGA-E[c(RGDyK)]2 and 64Cu-NODAGA-E[c(RGDyK)]2 in vivo using human xenograft tumors in mice. Human radiation burden was estimated to evaluate potential for future use as clinical PET tracers for imaging of neo-angiogenesis. Method(s): A 68Ge/68Ga generator was used for the synthesis of 68Ga-NODAGA-E[c(RGDyK)]2. 68Ga and 64Cu labeled NODAGA-E[c(RGDyK)]2 tracers were administrated in nude mice bearing either human glioblastoma (U87MG) or human neuroendocrine (H727) xenograft tumors. PET/CT scans at 3 time points were used for calculating the tracer uptake in tumors (%ID/g), integrin alphaVbeta3 target specificity was shown by blocking with cold NODAGA-E[c(RGDyK)]2, and biodistribution in normal organs were also examined. From biodistribution data in mice human radiation-absorbed doses were estimated using OLINDA/EXM software. Result(s): 68Ga-NODAGA-E[c(RGDyK)]2 was synthesized with a radiochemical purity of 89%-99% and a specific activity (SA) of 16-153MBq/nmol. 64Cu-NODAGA-E[c(RGDyK)]2 had a purity of 92%-99% and an SA of 64-78MBq/nmol.Both tracers showed similar uptake in xenograft tumors 1. h after injection (U87MG: 2.23 vs. 2.31%ID/g; H727: 1.53 vs. 1.48%ID/g). Both RGD dimers showed similar tracer uptake in non-tumoral tissues and a human radiation burden of less than 10. mSv with an administered dose of 200. MBq was estimated. Conclusion(s): 68Ga-NODAGA-E[c(RGDyK)]2 and 64Cu-NODAGA-E[c(RGDyK)]2 can be easily synthesized and are both promising candidates for PET imaging of integrin alphaVbeta3 positive tumor cells. 68Ga-NODAGA-E[c(RGDyK)]2 showed slightly more stable tumor retention. With the advantage of in-house commercially 68Ge/68Ga generators, 68Ga-NODAGA-E[c(RGDyK)]2 may be the best choice for future clinical PET imaging in humans. © 2014 Elsevier Inc.",Excluded
2708,"Elevated mortality among birds in Chernobyl as judged from skewed age and sex ratios BACKGROUND: Radiation has negative effects on survival of animals including humans, although the generality of this claim is poorly documented under low-dose field conditions. Because females may suffer disproportionately from the effects of radiation on survival due to differences in sex roles during reproduction, radiation-induced mortality may result in male-skewed adult sex ratios., METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDING: We estimated the effects of low-dose radiation on adult survival rates in birds by determining age ratios of adults captured in mist nets during the breeding season in relation to background radiation levels around Chernobyl and in nearby uncontaminated control areas. Age ratios were skewed towards yearlings, especially in the most contaminated areas, implying that adult survival rates were reduced in contaminated areas, and that populations in such areas could only be maintained through immigration from nearby uncontaminated areas. Differential mortality in females resulted in a strongly male-skewed sex ratio in the most contaminated areas. In addition, males sang disproportionately commonly in the most contaminated areas where the sex ratio was male skewed presumably because males had difficulty finding and acquiring mates when females were rare. The results were not caused by permanent emigration by females from the most contaminated areas because none of the recaptured birds had changed breeding site, and the proportion of individuals with morphological abnormalities did not differ significantly between the sexes for areas with normal and higher levels of contamination., CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: These findings are consistent with the hypothesis that the adult survival rate of female birds is particularly susceptible to the effects of low-dose radiation, resulting in male skewed sex ratios at high levels of radiation. Such skewed age ratios towards yearlings in contaminated areas are consistent with the hypothesis that an area exceeding 30,000 km(2) in Chernobyl's surroundings constitutes an ecological trap that causes dramatic excess mortality.",Included
1929,"The complex case of MACS J0717.5+3745 and its extended filament: Intra-cluster light, galaxy luminosity function, and galaxy orientations Context. The properties of galaxies are known to be affected by their environment, but although galaxies in clusters and groups have been quite thoroughly investigated, little is known about galaxies belonging to filaments of the cosmic web, or about the properties of the filaments themselves. Aims. Here we investigate the properties of the rich cluster MACS J0717.5+3745 and its extended filament by analyzing the distribution and fractions of intra-cluster light (ICL) in its core and by trying to detect intra-filament light (IFL) in the filament. We analyze the galaxy luminosity function (GLF) of the cluster core and of the filament. We also study the orientations of galaxies in the filament to better constrain the filament properties. Methods. This work is based on Hubble Space Telescope (HST) archive data, both from the Hubble Frontier Fields in the F435W, F606W, F814W, and F105W bands, and from a mosaic of images in the F606W and F814W bands. The spatial distribution of the ICL was determined with our new wavelet-based software, DAWIS. The GLFs were extracted in the F606W and F814W bands, with a statistical subtraction of the background, and fit with Schechter functions. The galaxy orientations in the filaments were estimated with SExtractor after correction for the point spread function. Results. We detect a large amount of ICL in the cluster core, but no IFL in the cosmic filament. The fraction of ICL in the core peaks in the F606W filter before decreasing with wavelength. Though relatively noisy, the GLFs in the filament are notably different from those of field galaxies, with a flatter faint end slope and an excess of bright galaxies. We do not detect a significant alignment of the galaxies in the filament region analyzed. 2019 A. Ellien et al.",Excluded
1566,"Super-enhancers modulate interleukin-6 expression and function in cancers Background: It is widely accepted that inflammatory cytokine, interleukin 6 (IL-6), was not only elevated in cancer but also important in carcinogenesis. But how did IL-6 be produced in tumor microenvironment remains to be addressed. Method(s): Both bioinformatics tools and quantitative real time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) were used to examine the expression of IL-6 in cancer cells. To map super-enhancers of IL-6, sgRNAs were constructed. Stable knockout cells were established and subsequently used for cell proliferation and colony formation assay. The correlation between mapped super-enhancers and IL-6 expression was studied by ATAC-seq analysis. Result(s): The expression of IL-6 was high in multiple cancers, including pancreatic cancer (PAAD). The elevated expression of IL-6 in PAAD was further confirmed by transcriptional data and in a panel of pancreatic cancer cell lines (one immortal HPDE6-C7 cell line and four PDAC cell lines: BxPC-3, PANC-1, AsPC-1 and CFPAC-1). When treated with JQ-1 and I-BET-762, two inhibitors of super-enhancers, the expression of IL-6 in multiple cancer cells including CFPAC-1, HeLa and SUM-159 cells was significantly reduced. By analyzing the H3K27Ac profiling, BRD4 binding, Med1 binding and DNA conservation in CFPAC-1, HeLa and SUM-159 cells, we identified a potential super-enhancer (IL6-SE) that might be important for IL-6 expression in cancer. The super-enhancer (IL6-SE) can be further divided into two elements (IL6-SEa and IL6-SEb). Genetic deletion of IL6-SEa in cancer cells greatly reduces the expression of IL-6. IL6-SEa deficient cells also showed low proliferation and colony formation ability. In patients, the epigenetic activation (ATAC signal) of IL6-SEa is correlated with the expression of IL-6. Conclusion(s): In summary, we not only provide convincing experimental evidence to demonstrate that IL-6 expression in cancer is dependent on super-enhancers but also identified IL6-SEa as a critical DNA regulatory element. Our findings provide new insights to understand the epigenetic regulation of IL-6 expression in cancers.Copyright © Translational Cancer Research. All rights reserved.",Excluded
33,"Olecranon fractures in adults: Factors influencing outcome In a retrospective, non-randomized study, we reviewed our experience with the operative treatment of olecranon fractures to find out which factors correlate with subjective complaints and functional outcome. A total of 95 consecutive olecranon fractures were operatively treated in our level I trauma institution between 1 March 1992 and 1 March 2000. Medical records and X-rays of all patients were evaluated. Three patients died, 23 were lost to follow-up. Fifty-eight of 69 available patients (84.0%) were reviewed clinically and/or radiologically after a mean time of 36 months. Fracture type, fracture classification, associated lesions, technical correctness of osteosynthesis, age and comorbidity were analysed. Radiological end result (intraarticular steps, gaps, arthrosis), subjective complaints, mobility of the elbow joint and muscle strength were evaluated. Patients with an unstable elbow (Mayo classification Type III and Schatzker-Schmeling classification Type D) had a higher loss of elbow function than others. There was a correlation between fracture morphology (fractures Type C and Type D in the Schatzker-Schmeling classification) and arthrosis. There also was a correlation between suboptimal osteosynthesis and arthrosis. There was no correlation between suboptimal osteosynthesis, implant loosening and secondary procedures. Patients more often expressed subjective complaints and loss of function in activities of daily life before than after metal removal. Primary elbow instability and fracture morphology are prognostic factors for elbow function and development of arthrosis after operative treatment of olecranon fractures. We, therefore, recommend the classification systems of the Mayo-clinic or of Schatzker-Schmeling. As many patients have complaints related to the implants, we recommend metal removal after fracture healing. © 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",Excluded

Expression of Epstein-Barr virus gene products will affect the radiosensitivity of the cancer cells. Here, the association between EBV BamH1-A rightward transcript 7 microRNA (ebv-miR-BART7) and the effects on irradiation sensitivity was explored. Methods Tissue ebv-miR-BART7 expression level was quantified using real-time quantitative PCR. The radiosensitivity of nasopharyngeal carcinoma cells with ebv-miR-BART7 expression was evaluated by colony formation assay, cell proliferation assay, apoptosis assay, H2AX phosphorylation staining and acridine orange staining. In addition, xenograft model was developed using zebrafish embryo to validate the in vivo radiation sensitivity of the ebv-miR-BART7-expressing NPC. Results Primary NPC tissues and recurrent NPC tissues had a significant higher ebv-miR-BART7 level in comparison with the corresponding normal counterparts. ebv-miR-BART7-expressing NPC cells had higher sensitivity to irradiation treatment. Conclusion Our results suggested that NPC patients have an elevated ebv-miR-BART expression in the primary NPC and recurrent NPC tissue. High ebv-miR-BART increases the sensitivity of NPC cells to irradiation treatment. Further investigation on the clinical value of ebv-miR-BART7 to the therapeutic response is warranted to evaluate the potential use of ebv-miR-BART7 as molecular biomarker in monitoring NPC patients.",Included
1069,"Effects of X-rays and cigarette smoking on leukocyte, lymphocyte and mitotic index values and SCE rates: the relationship between mitotic index and lymphocyte count Many previous studies revealed that smoking increases leukocyte and lymphocyte counts while exposure to X-rays decreases these counts. However the relationships between lymphocyte life span and smoking as well as X-rays were not well documented. The primary aim of this study was to determine relationships between smoking X-rays (in combination and individually) and life span of lymphocytes. Blood samples from 200 healthy individuals, half of which were X-ray exposed individuals, were collected. Half of X-ray exposed and of non-X-ray exposed individuals were smokers. There were equal numbers of male and female participants. Two lymphocyte cultures, one for the sister chromatid exchange (SCE) analysis and the other for the determination of mitotic index values were prepared using one part of the blood samples collected from the individuals. From the other part of the blood sample leukocyte and lymphocyte counts were determined with a haemogram device. Evaluation of the findings suggested that leukocyte count, lymphocyte count, mitotic index were relatively lower for the X-ray exposed individuals. In addition these values were higher for smokers than nonsmokers in general. The highest SCE rates were recorded for smoking radiology technicians. The most important finding is that lymphocyte life span is relatively low in smokers and in X-ray exposed males.",Included
3645,"Randomized phase II chemotherapy and radiotherapy trial for patients with locally advanced inoperable non-small-cell lung cancer: long-term follow-up of RTOG 92-04 PURPOSE: The standard treatment for patients with locally advanced inoperable non-small-cell lung cancer and good prognostic factors has become combined chemotherapy (ChT) and radiotherapy (RT). However, the sequencing of the two modalities, as well as fractionation of RT, has been controversial. The Radiation Therapy Oncology Group (RTOG) Study 92-04 was a randomized Phase II study designed to evaluate further the toxicity and efficacy of 2 different strategies of chemoradiation evaluated in 2 prior RTOG Phase II studies., METHODS: Patients with Stage II or III medically inoperable or unresectable non-small-cell lung cancer, good performance status, and minimal weight loss were enrolled into a prospective randomized Phase II RTOG study. Arm 1 consisted of induction ChT (vinblastine 5 mg/m(2) i.v. bolus weekly for the first 5 weeks, and cisplatin, 100 mg/m(2) i.v. on Days 1 and 29) followed by concurrent ChT/RT (cisplatin 75 mg/m(2) i.v. on Days 50, 71, and 92) during thoracic radiotherapy (63 Gy in 34 fractions during 7 weeks starting on Day 50). Arm 2 was concurrent ChT and hyperfractionated RT starting on Day 1 with a total dose of 69.6 Gy in 58 fractions during 6 weeks, 1.2 Gy/fraction b.i.d. ChT consisted of cisplatin, 50 mg/m(2) i.v. on Days 1 and 8, and oral VP-16, 50 mg b.i.d. for 10 days only on the days of thoracic radiotherapy repeated on Day 29., RESULTS: A total of 168 patients were entered between 1992 and 1994, and 163 patients were eligible for analysis. Eighty-one patients were treated in Arm 1 and 82 patients in Arm 2. Pretreatment characteristics, including age, gender, Karnofsky performance status, histologic features, and stage, were similar. The incidence of acute esophagitis was significantly higher among patients treated in Arm 2 than among those treated in Arm 1 (p <0.0001). The incidence of acute hematologic toxicity was significantly higher among patients treated in Arm 1 (p = 0.01 for anemia and p = 0.03 for other hematologic toxicities) than among those treated in Arm 2. Analysis of late toxicity showed that chronic esophageal toxicity was significantly more frequent in Arm 2 than in Arm 1 (p = 0.003). The time to in-field progression was significantly different (p = 0.009), favoring Arm 2 compared with Arm 1 (26% vs. 45% with failure in 2 years and 30% vs. 49% with failure in 4 years, respectively). The median 2-year and overall 5-year survival rates were similar between the two arms., CONCLUSION: Concurrent ChT and hyperfractionated RT resulted in a significant prolongation of the time to in-field progression, but with higher acute and chronic esophagitis. No other significant differences were observed between the two groups. Investigation with a chemoradio-protector is under way.",Excluded
710,"Different patterns of allelic imbalance in sporadic tumors and tumors associated with long-term exposure to gamma-radiation The study aimed to reveal cancer related mutations in DNA repair and cell cycle genes associated with chronic occupational exposure to gamma-radiation in personnel of the Siberian Group of Chemical Enterprises (SGCE). Mutations were analyzed by comparing genotypes of malignant tumors and matched normal tissues of 255 cancer patients including 98 exposed to external gamma-radiation (mean dose 128.1 +/- 150.5 mSv). Also a genetic association analysis was carried out in a sample of 149 cancer patients and 908 healthy controls occupationally exposed to gamma-radiation (153.2 +/- 204.6 mSv and 150.5 +/- 211.2 mSv, respectively). Eight SNPs of genes of DNA excision repair were genotyped (rs13181, rs1052133 , rs1042522, rs2305427, rs4244285, rs1045642, rs1805419 and rs1801133). The mutation profiles in heterozygous loci for selected SNP were different between sporadic tumors and tumors in patients exposed to radiation. In sporadic tumors, heterozygous genotype Arg/Pro of the rs1042522 SNP mutated into Arg/0 in 15 cases (9.6%) and 0/Pro in 14 cases (8.9%). The genotype Lys/Gln of the rs13181 SNP mutated into Lys/0 and 0/Gln in 9 and 4 cases, respectively. In tumors of patients exposed to low-level radiation, the rs1042522 Arg/0 mutated genotype was found in 12 cases (12.1%), while in 2 cases (2%) 0/Pro mutation was observed. Finally, the rs13181 0/Gln mutated genotype was observed in 15 cases (16,5%) Thus, our study showed the difference in patterns of allelic imbalance in tumors appeared under low-level radiation exposure and spontaneous tumors for selected SNPs. This suggests different mechanisms of inactivation of heterozygous genotypes in sporadic and radiation-induced tumors.Copyright © 2015 Elsevier B.V.",Included
189,"Sex-Specific Effects of a Wartime-Like Radiation Exposure on Cognitive Function Evaluating the risk for central nervous system (CNS) effects after whole-body or partial-body irradiation presents challenges due in part to the varied exposure scenarios in the context of occupational, accidental or wartime releases. Risk estimations are further complicated by the fact that robust changes in brain function are unlikely to manifest until significantly late post exposure times. Collectively, the current data regarding CNS radiation risk are conflicting in humans and a survey of the animal model data shows that it is similarly inconsistent. Due to the sparseness of such data, the current study was conducted using male and female mice to evaluate the brain for the delayed effects of a 2 Gy whole-body exposure to c rays starting six months postirradiation. Behavioral testing indicated sex-specific differences in the induction of anxiety-like behaviors and in the ability to abolish fear memories. Molecular analyses showed alterations in post-synaptic protein levels that might affect synaptic plasticity and increased levels of global DNA methylation, suggesting a potential epigenetic mechanism that might contribute to radiation-induced cognitive dysfunction. These data add to the understanding of the CNS response to whole-body irradiation and may lead to improved risk assessment and provide guidance in the development of effective radiation countermeasures to protect military personnel and civilians alike.",Included

A thermolucent digital dosimeter was worn at chest level without a lead apron. Dosimeter readings and distance from the spine surgeon were recorded. RESULTS .: Average surgeon exposure was 44.22 +/- 17.4 murem (range: 17.71-70.76 murem). The mean distance from the O-ARM was 4.56 +/- .32 m, and the surgeon was exposed for an average of 19.6 +/- 5.7 seconds (range: 8.05-28.7 s). The annual number of necessary procedures required to surpass the exposure limit, according to the data presented here, would be 113,071 operations using O-ARM. Hence, the number of necessary procedures for O-ARM use is predicted to be 1,130,710 annual procedures to reach the occupational exposure limits for extremity, skin, and all other organs and 339,213 procedures to reach the limits for the lens of eye., CONCLUSION: Radiation exposure is minimal to the surgical team during routine use of the O-ARM imaging system.

2145,"New and evolving concepts in CT for abdominal vascular imaging Computed tomographic (CT) angiography has become the standard of care, supplanting invasive angiography for comprehensive initial evaluation of acute and chronic conditions affecting the vascular system in the abdomen and elsewhere. Over the past decade, the capabilities of CT have improved substantially; simultaneously, the expectations of the referring physician and vascular surgeons have also evolved. Increasingly, CT angiography is used as an imaging biomarker for treatment selection and assessment of effectiveness. However, the growing use of CT angiography has also introduced some challenges, as potential radiation-associated and contrast media-induced risks need to be addressed. These concerns can be partly confronted by modifying scanning parameters (applying a low tube voltage) with or without using software-based solutions. Most recently, multienergy technology has endowed CT with new capabilities offering improved CT angiographic image quality and novel plaque characterization while decreasing radiation and iodine dose. In this article, we discuss current and new approaches using both conventional and multienergy CT for studying vascular disease in the abdomen. We propose various approaches to overcoming commonly encountered image quality challenges in CT angiography. In addition, we describe supplemental strategies for improving patient safety that leverage the available technology.Copyright ©RSNA, 2014.",Excluded

2538,"Stereotactic body radiation therapy with concurrent full-dose gemcitabine for locally advanced pancreatic cancer: A pilot trial demonstrating safety Background: Concurrent chemoradiation is a standard option for locally advanced pancreatic cancer (LAPC). Concurrent conventional radiation with full-dose gemcitabine has significant toxicity. Stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) may provide the opportunity to administer radiation in a shorter time frame with similar efficacy and reduced toxicity. This Pilot study assessed the safety of concurrent full-dose gemcitabine with SBRT for LAPC. Method(s): Patients received gemcitabine, 1000 mg/m2 for 6 cycles. During week 4 of cycle 1, patients received SBRT (25 Gy delivered in five consecutive daily fractions of 5 Gy prescribed to the 75-83% isodose line). Acute and late toxicities were assessed using NIH CTCAE v3. Tumor response was assessed by RECIST. Patients underwent an esophagogastroduodenoscopy at baseline, 2, and 6 months to assess the duodenal mucosa. Quality of life (QoL) data was collected before and after treatment using the QLQ-C30 and QLQ-PAN26 questionnaires. Result(s): Between September 2009 and February 2011, 11 patients enrolled with one withdrawal during radiation therapy. Patients had grade 1 to 2 gastrointestinal toxicity from the start of SBRT to 2 weeks after treatment. There were no grade 3 or greater radiation-related toxicities or delays for cycle 2 of gemcitabine. On endoscopy, there were no grade 2 or higher mucosal toxicities. Two patients had a partial response. The median progression free and overall survival were 6.8 and 12.2 months, respectively. Global QoL did not change between baseline and immediately after radiation treatment. Conclusion(s): SBRT with concurrent full dose gemcitabine is safe when administered to patients with LAPC. There is no delay in administration of radiation or chemotherapy, and radiation is completed with minimal toxicity. © 2013 Gurka et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",Excluded
2076,"The lack of cytotoxic effect and radioadaptive response in splenocytes of mice exposed to low level internal beta-particle irradiation through tritiated drinking water in vivo Health effects of tritium, a beta-emitter and a by-product of the nuclear industry, is a subject of significant controversy. This mouse in vivo study was undertaken to monitor biological effects of low level tritium exposure. Mice were exposed to tritiated drinking water (HTO) at 10 KBq/L, 1 MBq/L and 20 MBq/L concentrations for one month. The treatment did not result in a significant increase of apoptosis in splenocytes. To examine if this low level tritium exposure alters radiosensitivity, the extracted splenocytes were challenged in vitro with 2 Gy gamma-radiation, and apoptotic responses at 1 and 24 h were measured. No alterations in the radiosensitivity were detected in cells from mice exposed to tritium compared to sham-treated mice. In contrast, low dose gamma-irradiation at 20 or 100 mGy, resulted in a significant increase in resistance to apoptotic cell death after 2 Gy irradiation; an indication of the radioadaptive response. Overall, our data suggest that low concentrations of tritium given to mice as HTO in drinking water do not exert cytotoxic effect in splenocytes, nor do they change cellular sensitivity to additional high dose gamma-radiation. The latter may be considered as the lack of a radioadaptive response, typically observed after low dose gamma-irradiation. © 2013 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.",Included

759,"Changes in symptom clusters in patients undergoing radiation therapy GOALS OF WORK: The goals of the study were to determine the occurrence rates for and the severity of symptoms at the middle, end, and 1 month after the completion of radiation therapy (RT), to determine the number and types of symptom clusters at these three time points, and to evaluate for changes over time in these symptom clusters., MATERIALS AND METHODS: Symptom occurrence and severity were evaluated using the Memorial Symptom Assessment Scale (MSAS) in a sample of patients (n = 160) who underwent RT for breast or prostate cancer. At each time point, an exploratory factor analysis was done to determine the number of symptom clusters (i.e., symptom factors) based on the MSAS symptom severity ratings., MAIN RESULTS: The majority of the patients were male and married with a mean age of 61.1 years. The five symptoms with the highest occurrence rates across all three time points were lack of energy, pain, difficulty sleeping, feeling drowsy, and sweats. Although the number of symptoms and the specific symptoms within each symptom cluster were not identical across the three time points, three relatively similar symptom clusters (i.e., mood-cognitive"" symptom cluster, ""sickness-behavior"" symptom cluster, ""treatment-related"", or ""pain"" symptom cluster) were identified in this sample. The internal consistency coefficients for the mood-cognitive symptom cluster and sickness-behavior symptom cluster were adequate at > or =0.68., CONCLUSIONS: Three relatively stable symptom clusters were found across RT. The majority of the symptom cluster severity scores were significantly higher in patients with breast cancer compared to patients with prostate cancer.""",Included
2808,"[Occurrence of immune hyperthyroidism after radioiodine therapy of autonomous goiter] AIM: The goal of the study was to examine the prevalence of Graves' disease following I-131 treatment of autonomous goiter with special regard to pretreatment scintigraphic patterns., PATIENTS AND METHOD: Pre- and posttreatment in-vitro and in-vivo parameters were studied in 375 consecutive patients treated with I-131 therapy for nodular or diffuse autonomous goiter. All patients included were within ambulant control for at least 2.5 months following treatment. According to the pretreatment Tc-99m pertechnetate scan 59% (220/375) had multifocal (MF), 23% (86/375) unifocal (UF), 10% (38/375) mixed focal-disseminated (FD) and 8% (31/375) disseminated (D) scintigraphic patterns., RESULTS: In 93.9% (352/375), the autonomous tissue was totally, in 2.1% (8/375) partially and in 1.6% (6/375) insufficiently eliminated. In 2.4% (9/375) a relapse of hyperthyroidism was observed 2 to 10 months following I-131 therapy. In 8 patients a relapse of hyperthyroidism was accompanied or followed by an elevation of the previously non-elevated TSH-receptor antibody (TRAb) level and in 1 patient by an TRAb increase to the upper borderline range implicating Graves' disease. With the prevalence of Graves' disease following I-131 therapy a statistically significant difference in pretreatment Tc-99m pertechnetate scintigraphic patterns was found: 0% of unifocal (0/86) or multifocal (0/220), however 18% (7/38) of focal-disseminated and 7% (2/31) of disseminated scintigraphic patterns. From the 366 patients without relapse of hyperthyroidism 2 (MF) had elevated pre- and posttreatment TRAb levels and 3 (D) had elevated TRAb levels for the first time after I-131 therapy., CONCLUSION: There is a low overall prevalence (2.4%) of Graves' disease following I-131 therapy for nodular or diffuse autonomous goiter. However, the prevalence of posttreatment Graves' disease is highly dependent upon pretreatment scintigraphic patterns exhibiting focal-disseminated or disseminated patterns.",Excluded
1641,"Effects of non-covalent self-association on the subcutaneous absorption of a therapeutic peptide PURPOSE: To utilize an acylated peptide as a model system to investigate the relationships among solution peptide conformation, non-covalent self-association, subcutaneous absorption and bioavailability under pharmaceutically relevant solution formulation conditions., METHODS: CD spectroscopy, FTIR spectroscopy, equilibrium sedimentation, dynamic light scattering, and size exclusion chromatography were employed to characterize the effects of octanoylation on conformation and self-association of the 31 amino acid peptide derivative des-amino-histidine(7) arginine(26) human glucagon-like peptide (7-37)-OH (IP(7)R(26)GLP-1). Hyperglycemic clamp studies were performed to compare the bioavailability, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamics of solution formulations of oct-IP(7)R(26)GLP-1 administered subcutaneously to normal dogs., RESULTS: Octanoylation of IP(7)R(26)GLP-1 was shown to confer the propensity for a major solvent-induced conformational transition with an accompanying solvent- and temperature-dependent self-association behavior. Formulations were characterized that give rise to remarkably different pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics that correlate with distinct peptide conformational and self-association states. These states correspond to: (i) a minimally associated alpha-helical form (apparent molecular weight = 14 kDa), (ii) a highly associated, predominantly beta-sheet form (effective molecular diameter 20 nm), and (iii) an unusually large, micelle-like soluble beta-sheet aggregate (effective molecular diameter 50 nm)., CONCLUSIONS: Bioavailability and pharmacokinetics of a self-associating peptide can be influenced by aggregate size and the ease of disruption of the non-covalent intermolecular interactions at the subcutaneous site. Hydrophobic aggregation mediated by seemingly innocuous solution formulation conditions can have a dramatic effect on the subcutaneous bioavailability and pharmacokinetics of a therapeutic peptide and in the extreme, can totally preclude its absorption. A size exclusion chromatographic method is identified that distinguishes subcutaneously bioavailable aggregated oct-IP(7)R(26)GLP-1 from non-bioavailable aggregated oct-IP(7)R(26)GLP-1.",Excluded

The linear energy transfers (LET infinity s) for the radiations were 90 +/- 5, 35 +/- 3, and 0.3 keV/micrometer, respectively. After irradiation, lenticular opacities were monitored through their incipient and/or clinical stages (less than or equal to 5 years) by slit-lamp biomicroscopy and scored with subjective, but well-defined, indices. Cataractogenesis, which progressed according to the model proposed by Rubin and Casarett (1968), was modified by radiation quality in the following ways. (1) The rate of development of the early (acute) stage increased with the LET infinity of the incident radiation; (2) at the intermediate (plateau) stage, the values for the relative biological effectiveness (r.b.e.) of the heavy ions were similar to those reported for proliferating cells in culture; (3) for a given intermediate level, the onset of late cataractogenesis occurred earlier the higher the LET affinity of the radiation involved.

405,"Efficacy of sucralfate ointment in the prevention of acute proctitis in cancer patients: A randomized controlled clinical trial Background: Acute radiation proctitis (ARP) is a usual adverse effect in patients undergoing pelvic radiotherapy. The symptoms include diarrhea, rectal blood or mucus discharge, fecal urgency and tenesmus with pain. Sucralfate, an aluminum-based salt of sucrose octasulfate, is a cytoprotective agent that forms a coating barrier at injured sites by adhering to mucoproteins. It has been used in topical management of a wide variety of local lesion. This study was designed to evaluate the preventive effect of rectal sucralfate on acute radiotherapy induced proctitis. Method(s): Seven percent sucralfate ointment was prepared for topical use. Drug quantification, chemical stability and microbial limit tests were performed carefully. In this randomized double blind placebo controlled trial, fifty-seven patients with pelvic malignancies undergoing radiotherapy were allocated to receive either 1 g of sucralfate or 1 g of placebo, given as a twice daily ointment, one day before and during radiotherapy for six weeks. The eligible patients were evaluated based on RTOG acute toxicity criteria and the following ARP symptoms weekly: Rectal hemorrhage, diarrhea, rectal pain, and fecal urgency. The influence of symptoms on lifestyle was also recorded weekly. Result(s): Acute proctitis was significantly less prevalent in patients in the sucralfate group. The incidence of rectal bleeding (P=0.003), diarrhea (P=0.002), rectal pain (P=<0.001) and fecal urgency (P=0.002) was significantly less common in the sucralfate group. No statistical significant difference was observed for radiotherapy induced cystitis in the placebo and sucralfate groups (P=0.27).

The experimental group (30 patients) was treated with ""Xinjingjie mouthrinse"" during the full course of radiotherapy, 4 times daily with 5 mL and 5 min each time. The control group (30 patients) rinsed the mouth in the same way with normal saline. Oral mucositis was assessed according to the RTOG criteria. The severity of mucositis and the degree of pain were recorded and photographed. Patients shouldn't be treated with other drugs until the level of oral mucositis reached above grade III. The results were statistically analyzed using Stata 12.0 software packages., RESULTS: Age, gender, radiotherapy techniques and dose showed no significant difference between the 2 groups (P>0.05). The first onset of oral mucositis in the experimental group was later than that in the control group (11.0 times:9.1 times,P<0.05), and the incidence of pain at the early time of radiotherapy was lower (36.7%: 70.0%, P<0.05). Also, the onset time of grade III oral mucositis in the emperimental group was later than that in the control group (18.9 times:15.9 times,P<0.05), and the incidence of grade III oral mucositis in the experimental group was lower (63.3% vs. 90.0%, P<0.05)., CONCLUSIONS: ""Xinjingjie mouthrinse"" is worthwhile to be used in clinic because it can delay the occurrence time of radiation-induced oral mucositis, alleviate pain and reduce the indication of grade III oral mucositis.""",Excluded

Intensity modulated radiation therapy, amifostine, and pilocarpine were not allowed, but postoperative chemotherapy was allowed. Each operation was reviewed by 2 reviewers and radiation by 1 reviewer. If 13 or more (of 43) were ""not per protocol,"" then the technique would be considered not reproducible as per study design. The secondary endpoint was the rate of acute xerostomia, grade 2 or higher, and a rate of <= 51% was acceptable., RESULTS: Forty-four of the total 49 patients were analyzable: male (81.8%), oropharynx (63.6%), stage IV (61.4%), median age 56.5 years. SGT was ""per protocol"" or within acceptable variation in 34 patients (77.3%) and XRT in 79.5%. Nine patients (20.9%) developed grade 2 acute xerostomia; 2 had grade 0-1 xerostomia (4.7%) but started on amifostine/pilocarpine.

2229,"Gender-related significance of time interval between radiotherapy and surgery in hypofractionated preoperative radiotherapy for rectal cancer patients' survival Aim and background: An optimal break between radiotherapy (RT) and surgery in short-course of RT (SCRT) for locally advanced rectal cancer is not clearly established.The aim of the study was to investigate the influence of the break in the preoperative SCRT and overall treatment time (OTT) for locally advanced rectal cancer patients (whole group and male/female subgroups) on patients overall survival (OS), recurrence-free survival (RFS), metastasis-free survival (MFS). Material(s) and Method(s): 131 patients were treated with SCRT (5 Gy/5 days), followed by surgery 3-53 days later. Break was calculated as the time interval between the end of irradiation to surgery and OTT as time interval from the beginning of RT to surgery. Result(s): Mean break was 21.5 (range 3-53.0) days and mean OTT was 26.5 (range 7-58.0) days. In univariate analysis, a break longer than 15 days and OTT >23 days were negative prognostic factors for OS for all patients, and particularly for the male patients' subgroup. RFS was non-significantly higher (P = 0.066) for patients treated with a break <=15 days and OTT <=23 days (P = 0.099), irrespectively of patients' sex. Patients treated with a break longer than 15 days and OTT >23 days had non-significantly lower level of MFS than those treated with a shorter break (P = 0.269) and OTT <=23 days (P = 0.498). Conclusion(s): In SCRT, a break in the treatment longer than 15 days, especially in the male patients subgroup, should be avoided, because it negatively affects patients' survival.Copyright © 2016 Greater Poland Cancer Centre.",Excluded

The present study aimed to determine whether adjuvant treatment improved survival for stage IIb-III thoracic esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (TESCC). Method(s): A retrospective review of patients diagnosed as esophageal carcinoma at the Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences Cancer hospital, between January 2004 and December 2011, was performed. A database compiling 975 patents with node positive or stage III thoracic esophageal carcinoma after R0 surgery with or without postoperative radiation/chemoradiation was created. A 1:1 matched study group was generated by the Greedy method after propensity score matching (PSM) analysis. Survival curves were calculated by the Kaplan-Meier method and compared with the log-rank test. Univariate and multivariate analyses were using the Cox proportional hazards regression model. Result(s): 975 patients were enrolled in the study, 510 patients (52.3%) did not receive any postoperative treatment after R0 surgery and 465 patients had either postoperative chemoradiation or radiotherapy. Median follow-up was 69.2 months. After PSM, 222 well-balanced patients in each group demonstrated the same results. The 3-year, 5-year survival rates and median survival in surgery group (33.0%, 26.4%, 24.3 months) were inferior to those in postoperative treatment group (48.3%, 37.1% and 34.3 months), (P = 0.002).

Method(s): Simulations were used to evaluate the spectral separation of the low- and high-energy spectra and detective quantum efficiency was used for assessing image quality. Scan parameters were chosen to optimize spectral separation, image quality, and radiation dose. We introduce the measurement of volumetric BMD (vBMD) using basis material decomposition. We assess the accuracy of our methods by comparing measurements taken using bone images against reference data derived from subsequent incineration of the bones. In vivo scans were conducted to evaluate the system precision (repeatability) and agreement with a clinical densitometer. Result(s): Average errors for bone mineral content (BMC), areal BMD (aBMD), and vBMD were 4.85%, 5.49%, and 12.77%, respectively. Our system had good agreement with a clinical densitometer based on concordance correlation coefficient values of 0.92 and 0.98 for aBMD and BMC, respectively. Precision studies yielded coefficient of variation (CV) values of 1.35% for aBMD, 1.48% for BMC, and 1.80% for vBMD. The CV values of all measurements were within 2%, indicating that the methods have clinically acceptable precision. Conclusion(s): We conclude that our techniques yield bone measurements with high accuracy, clinically acceptable precision, and good agreement with a clinical densitometer. Significance: We have shown the clinical potential of phalangeal DXA measurements of aBMD and vBMD on a slot-scanning digital radiography system.Copyright © 2015 IEEE.",Excluded

However, it has been recently emphasized that AF ablation in patients with HF is associated with increased risks of procedure-related complications and mortality. There are little data about the differences in the efficacy and safety between cryoballoon (CB) and radiofrequency (RF) ablation of AF in patients with HF. Method(s): The CRABL-HF study is designed as a prospective, multicenter, open-label, controlled, and randomized clinical trial comparing the efficacy and safety of AF ablation between CB and RF ablation in patients with HF (LVEF <=40%) (UMIN Clinical Trials Registry UMIN000032433). The CRABL-HF study will consist of 110 patients at multicenter in Japan. The patients will be registered and randomly assigned to either the CB ablation or RF ablation group with a 1:1 allocation. The primary endpoint of this study is the occurrence of atrial tachyarrhythmias (ATs) at 1 year with a blanking period of 90 days after ablation. Key secondary endpoints are the success rate of the pulmonary vein isolation, total procedural time, left atrial dwelling time, total fluoroscopy time, radiation exposure, complication rate, composite of all-cause mortality or HF hospitalizations, cardiovascular events, change in left ventricular ejection fraction, and change in quality of life.

The aim of this study was to evaluate 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] concentration in patients with OD and to verify its association to nutritional status, functional independence measure (FIM), time of clinical signs (TCS) and OD severity. This is a cross-sectional study conducted with outpatients. Body mass index (BMI), FIM, TCS, causes of OD, comorbidities, penetration-aspiration scale (PAS) and severity scale were evaluated. Method(s): A multiple linear regression and effect size were performed to evaluate the association between serum 25(OH)D concentration and independent variables. Result(s): Forty-eight participants were included, with a mean age of 60.1 +/- 15.3 years. The mean of the 25(OH)D concentration was 26.10 +/- 12.0 ng/mL. The prevalence of hypovitaminosis D (<30 ng/mL) was 73%. In the multiple linear regression analysis (adjusted for sex, age, BMI, dietary intake and solar radiation), 25(OH)D concentration was significantly related with the TCS (p = 0.01, f2 = 0.48). Patients with hypovitaminosis D had a moderate effect (p = 0.08, delta = 0.36) for a lower FIM score.

The technique is also used for routine monitoring of occupationally exposed workers to determine radiation exposure. An in vitro irradiation study of human peripheral blood lymphocytes was conducted to establish a dose-response curve for radiation-induced dicentric aberrations. Blood samples were collected from volunteer donors and together with optically stimulated luminescence (OSL) dosimeters and were irradiated at 0, 0.1, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1, 2, 4, and 6 Gy using a cobalt-60 radiotherapy unit. Blood samples were cultured for 48 h, and the metaphase chromosomes were prepared following the procedure of the International Atomic Energy Agency's Emergency Preparedness and Response - Biodosimetry 2011 manual. At least 100 metaphases were scored for dicentric aberrations at each dose point. The data were analyzed using R language program. The results indicated that the distribution of dicentric cells followed a Poisson distribution and the dose-response curve was established using the estimated model, Ydic = 0.0003 (+/-0.0003) +0.0336 (+/-0.0115) x D + 0.0236 (+/-0.0054) x D2.

Posttreatment tumor response was assessed by cross-sectional imaging using the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) and tumor-marker levels. Laboratory and clinical toxicities and clinical symptoms were monitored., RESULTS: The median activity delivered was 1.63 GBq (range 0.63-2.36). Imaging follow-up using RECIST at 3-month follow-up demonstrated partial response, stable disease, and progressive disease in 22.5, 75.0, and 2.5% of patients, respectively. In 97.5% of patients, the liver lesions appeared hypovascular or partially necrotic. The mean follow-up was 16.2 months with 40 patients (95.2%) remaining alive. The median decrease in tumor-marker levels at 3 months was 54.8% (chromogranin A) and 37.3% (serotonin), respectively. There were no acute or delayed toxicities greater than grade 2 according to Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events [CTCAE (v3.0)]. No radiation-induced liver disease was noted. Improvement of clinical symptoms 3 months after treatment was observed in 36 of 38 symptomatic patients., CONCLUSION: Radioembolization with (90)Y-microspheres is a safe and effective treatment option in patients with otherwise treatment-refractory NETLMs. Antitumoral effect is supported by good local tumor control, decreased tumor-marker levels, and improved clinical symptoms.

1683,"NASA's space Launch System: Payload opportunities for lunar exploration, science missions Nearing its first launch, the Space Launch System (SLS), NASA's new super heavy-lift launch vehicle, offers highly energetic launches that deliver more mass and provide more volume in 8.4 m-diameter and potentially larger fairings to make a new generation of deep space missions possible. An evolvable launcher available in crew, crew with a co-manifested payload (CPL) and cargo-only configurations, SLS is a crucial capability to enable astronauts to return to the Moon, but it also offers key benefits for science missions. NASA's 21st-century return to the Moon recently received a formal name: the Artemis program. In addition to the core enabling capabilities of SLS and the Orion crew spacecraft, NASA will also enlist international and commercial partnerships for Artemis. The Agency intends to build a scientific outpost in lunar orbit, the Gateway, from which human and robotic missions to and from the surface can rendezvous. SLS will launch Orion on a series of missions leading to landing the first woman and the next man on the Moon as part of Artemis. SLS uses proven propulsion systems: two solid rocket boosters and four RS-25s engines that have been upgraded to provide more thrust and operate in the SLS environment. SLS Block 1 uses a modified Delta IV Heavy upper stage, called the Interim Cryogenic Propulsion Stage (ICPS) and lifts at least 26 metric tons (t) to trans-lunar injection (TLI). The Block 1 vehicle can also be outfitted with a 5 m-diameter fairing. Block 1B, the next major variant, also uses solid rocket boosters and RS-25 engines to achieve Earth escape velocity, but replaces the single-engine liquid hydrogen (LH2)/liquid oxygen (LOX) ICPS with a four-engine LH2/LOX Exploration Upper Stage (EUS) to increase mass to TLI to 34-37 t, depending on crew or cargo configuration. In the Block 1B crew configuration, a 10 m-tall Universal Stage Adapter (USA) connects the vehicle to Orion and can carry a CPL up to 10 t. The USA provides 286 m3 of unpressurized volume for payloads. For large payloads, 8.4 m- and 10 m-diameter cargo fairings in 19.1 m and 27.4 m lengths are possible. The ultimate SLS vehicle, Block 2, incorporates evolved boosters to reach a lift capacity of more than 45 t to TLI. The capabilities of SLS not only make new missions to the Moon possible, but also game-changing science missions, such as deployment of large-aperture space telescopes, spacecraft to the ice giants or even probes to the interstellar medium. This paper will discuss the capabilities of SLS, the vehicle's planned evolution, missions that can effectively utilize the vehicle and manufacturing status of the vehicle.

1507,"DNA Damage Baseline Predicts Resilience to Space Radiation and Radiotherapy Deep space exploration will require real-time, minimally invasive monitoring of astronaut health to mitigate the potential health impairments caused by space radiation and microgravity. Genotoxic stress in humans can be monitored by quantifying the amount of DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) in immune cells from a simple finger prick. In a cohort of 674 healthy donors, we show that the endogenous level of DSBs increases with age and with latent cytomegalovirus infection. To map the range of human responses to space radiation, we then study DSB induction and repair in immune cells from 319 healthy donors after the cells are exposed to galactic cosmic ray components and lymphocytes from 30 cancer patients after radiotherapy. Individuals with low baseline DSB have fewer clinical complications, enhanced DNA damage repair responses, and a functional dose-dependent cytokine response in healthy donor cells. This supports the use of DSB monitoring for health resilience in space., Pariset et al. find that individuals with a lower baseline level of DNA damage are resilient to clinical complications after radiotherapy and present higher radiation-induced levels of DNA repair foci and inflammatory cytokines. These findings support the use of baseline DNA damage as a biomarker for radiation sensitivity.Copyright © 2020",Included

870,"Intraoperative radiotherapy as adjuvant treatment for stage II/III rectal carcinoma In recent years, many efforts have focused on combined radiotherapy and chemotherapy as adjuvants to curative surgery in patients with stage II and III (UICC) rectal carcinomas. Intraoperative radiotherapy (IORT) makes it possible to increase the total irradiation dose in a locally restricted area while sparing normal mobile organs, but it is limited by increased late toxicity. A prospective phase I/II study was designed to evaluate the efficacy of moderate-dose intraoperative and external beam radiotherapy (IO-EBRT), in some cases with concomitant chemotherapy. Sixty-three patients with a stage II or III rectal carcinoma were eligible for analysis (median follow-up 30.6 months). Fifty-four patients had undergone a complete resection (RO). Mean IORT dose was 11.3 Gy and mean EBRT dose 41.4 Gy. In 45 patients (71.4%) concomitant chemotherapy was delivered (5-FU, leucovorin). Two patients suffered local failure. However, overall local tumor control was markedly improved compared to historical controls (96.8% vs 66.2%). Patients treated with IO-EBRT showed a reduced incidence of distant metastases after concomitant chemotherapy (17.6% vs 38.8%). A 4-year actuarial relapse-free survival of 82% was obtained after IO-EBRT plus chemotherapy, and 59% after IO-EBRT alone. The postoperative course was unremarkable in 47.6% of patients. No radiation colitis or neuropathy occurred. Moderate-dose IORT and EBRT is safe, taking into account related late toxicities. It is an effective local treatment approach, resulting in an encouraging local control rate.",Excluded
285,"Sonographic assessment of acute changes in plaque size and echogenicity and in intima-media thickness of carotid arteries after neck radiation therapy Ultrasonic assessment of acute changes in carotid artery walls before and after neck radiation therapy (RT). Fifty cancer patients scheduled for curative neck irradiation were included and underwent sonographic examination of carotid arteries, with assessment of intima-media thickness (IMT) and plaque size and echogenicity before and immediately after completion of RT. IMT was linearly correlated with age and before RT (r = 0.267, p = 0.007) and increased after RT (0.68 +/- 0.11 versus 0.87 +/- 0.16, p < 0.001), without correlation with total RT dose and protocol. New plaques (six hypoechoic, one hyperechoic, and one calcified) were found in eight patients after RT, while 17 of the 44 plaques that were present before RT increased in size, and 8 soft and 1 dense plaques in nine patients became calcified. Radiation in the acute phase not only increases the IMT but also causes new plaque formation and changes in plaque size and echogenicity. Copyright © 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",Excluded
3498,"A new recombined double low restorer line for the Ogu-INRA cms in rapeseed (Brassica napus L.) A major objective of breeders using the Ogu-INRA cytoplasmic male sterility (cms) system in rapeseed (Brassica napus L.) is to obtain double low restorer lines with a shorter introgression and a good agronomic value. The development of low glucosinolate content (low GC) restorer lines often occurs through the deletion of a part of the introgression. One of these lines has lost the radish Pgi-2 allele expression, without recovering that of the rapeseed Pgi-2 allele. This line shows a defect in the meiotic transmission of the restorer gene Rfo and a very poor agronomic value. We initiated a programme to force non-spontaneous recombination between this Rfo-carrying introgression and the rapeseed homologous chromosome from a low GC B. napus line. Gamma ray irradiation was used to induce chromosome breakage just prior meiosis aiming at just such a recombination. Low GC cms plants were crossed with the pollen of irradiated plants that were heterozygous for this introgression. The F 2 families were scored for their vigour, transmission rate of Rfo and female fertility. One family of plants, R2000, showed an improved behaviour for these three traits. This family presented a unique combination of molecular markers when compared to other rapeseed restorers analysed, which suggests that the recombination event allowed the recovery of B. oleracea genetic information that was originally replaced by the radish introgression in the original restorers. This resulted in a duplicated region (originating from radish and B. oleracea) on the chromosome carrying the introgression in the R2000 family. © Springer-Verlag 2005.",Excluded

Twenty-eight patients underwent FJI with fusion-guided technique, while CT-guided procedures were performed in the other cases. Clinical and procedural data were recorded and compared at a mean follow-up of 6.1+/-2.0 months., RESULTS: A significant improvement in clinical parameters was observed for both fusion-guided and CT-guided group. Comparing both groups, no statistically significant difference could be detected neither at baseline conditions nor during the follow-up period. No significant periprocedural complication occurred in both groups. A satisfaction rate of 92.3 and 81.1% was reported for fusion-guided and CT-guided group, respectively., CONCLUSION: EcoNav fusion-imaging system represents a safe, feasible, effective and reproducible guidance option in FJD infiltration procedures, also avoiding use of ionising radiations.",Excluded
3657,"Prospective ECG-gated coronary 320-MDCT angiography with absolute acquisition delay strategy for patients with persistent atrial fibrillation OBJECTIVE. The purpose of this study was to evaluate image quality and radiation dose when patients with atrial fibrillation undergo coronary CT angiography (CTA) using prospectively ECG-gated 320-MDCT technology with an absolute-delay strategy. MATERIALS AND METHODS. A cohort of 75 consecutive patients (60 men and 15 women; age (+/- SD), 71 +/- 10 years) who underwent prospectively ECG-gated coronary CTA using a 320-MDCT scanner during atrial fibrillation was matched with 75 control patients imaged in sinus rhythm. All coronary CTA for the atrial fibrillation cohort used absolute-delay strategy. Subjective image quality score and the dose-length product (DLP) were compared between the two cohorts and, for the atrial fibrillation cohort, among those patients imaged over a different number of heartbeats. The accuracy of stenosis detection was evaluated in 17 studies of the atrial fibrillation cohort using catheter angiography as a reference standard. RESULTS. For those patients imaged in atrial fibrillation, one- And two-beat acquisitions were performed in 26.7% (n = 20) and 40% (n = 30) of patients, respectively. There was no significant difference in image quality between the atrial fibrillation (2.9 +/- 0.4) and sinus rhythm (2.9 +/- 0.3) cohorts, nor was there a difference in image quality with respect to the number of heartbeats used in the acquisition. The atrial fibrillation cohort had an 80% higher DLP (680 +/- 470 vs 372 +/- 236 mGy x cm, p < 0.0001). The patient-based sensitivity and negative predictive value for stenosis detection were both 100%. CONCLUSION. Using an absolute-delay strategy, two thirds of patients who underwent prospectively ECG-gated coronary CTA using a 320-MDCT scanner were imaged within two heartbeats or fewer. Compared with patients imaged in sinus rhythm, the image quality was comparative and the radiation dose was 1.8-fold higher.",Excluded

885,"Lung dosimetry of inhaled radon progeny in mice Biological response of exposure to radon progeny has long been investigated, but there are only few studies in which absorbed doses in lungs of laboratory animals were estimated. The present study is the first attempt to calculate the doses of inhaled radon progeny for mice. For reference, the doses for rats and humans were also computed with the corresponding models. Lung deposition of particles, their clearance, and energy deposition of alpha particles to sensitive tissues were systematically simulated. Absorbed doses to trachea and bronchi, bronchioles and terminal bronchioles, alveolar-interstitial regions, and whole lung were first provided as a function of monodisperse radon progeny particles with an equilibrium equivalent radon concentration of 1 Bq m(-3) (equilibrium factor, 0.4 and unattached fraction, 0.01). Based on the results, absorbed doses were then calculated for (1) a reference mine condition and (2) a condition previously used for animal experiments. It was found that the whole lung doses for mice, rats, and humans were 34.8, 20.7, and 10.7 nGy (Bq m(-3))(-1) h(-1) for the mine condition, respectively, while they were 16.9, 9.9, and 6.5 nGy (Bq m(-3))(-1) h(-1) for the animal experimental condition. In both cases, the values for mice are about 2 times higher than those for rats, and about 3 times higher than those for humans. Comparison of our data on rats and humans with those published in the literature shows an acceptable agreement, suggesting the validity of the present modeling for mice. In the future, a more sophisticated dosimetric study of inhaled radon progeny in mice would be desirable to demonstrate how anatomical, physiological, and environmental parameters can influence absorbed doses.",Excluded

Methods - Colour Doppler imaging (CDI) was used to measure blood flow velocity and vascular resistance in the ophthalmic, short posterior, and central retinal arteries of nine patients suffering from uveal melanoma. The measurements were taken before, 6 months, 1 year, and 2 years after stereotactic radiotherapy. Irradiation was performed with the Leksell gamma knife with the 59 (41-66.5) Gy total marginal dose divided in two equal fractions. CDI results were compared with age and sex matched healthy control eyes. Results - At each time of measurement, blood flow velocity in the central retinal artery of the affected eyes was significantly reduced whereas vascular resistance was only increased at the 2 year follow up. Blood flow velocity and vascular resistance in the short posterior arteries of melanoma eyes were also only significantly altered at the 2 year follow up. Blood flow velocity and vascular resistance in the ophthalmic artery of melanoma eyes were not changed at all follow ups. Conclusions - In the melanoma eyes, blood flow velocity in the central retinal artery is reduced. High dose stereotactic radiotherapy with the Leksell gamma knife and a 59 (41-66.5) Gy total marginal dose in two fractions leads to a significant reduction of blood flow and a significant increase in resistance variables in the small ocular arteries within 2 years.",Excluded
1686,"An examination of radon awareness, risk communication, and radon risk reduction in a Hispanic community Purpose: Radiation risk communication is a critical component of radiation protection and the public's understanding of radiation risks and benefits. Risk communication becomes even more complicated when considering cultural and language differences. In the US, many diverse communities face risk communication challenges. We obtained radon testing data to evaluate patterns of radon testing in Allentown, the third largest city in Pennsylvania. Radon exposure is the second leading cause of lung cancer after smoking and is associated with over 21,000 lung cancer deaths in the US annually. It is estimated that 1 in every 15 homes in the US has elevated radon levels above the recommended action level set by the US Environmental Protection Agency. Allentown has some of the highest reported levels of indoor radon in the country, yet only a small portion of the population has tested their homes. This is true particularly among self-identified Hispanics, who make up nearly half of the city's population. This study seeks to (1) characterize the difference in testing rates between self-identified Hispanics and non-Hispanics in Allentown, (2) quantify the level of radon awareness and knowledge, (3) identify potential obstacles to radon testing among the Allentown population that self-identifies as Hispanic, and (4) determine whether more effective risk communication is needed. Method(s): Radon test results in Allentown were analyzed to better understand the nature of radon testing. To evaluate radon awareness and knowledge, a cross-sectional study was conducted using a face-to-face survey. This data was informative in assessing testing and mitigation practices, ethnicity, income level, age, education level, homeowner status, zip code and primary language. Result(s): Ethnicity was an independent predictor of radon awareness and knowledge. Statistically significant differences were found between the number of self-identified Hispanics (39%) and non-Hispanics (84%) who indicated that they had ever heard of radon; 13% of Hispanics and 49% of non-Hispanics knew that they lived in an area with typically high radon levels. There was a statistically significant association between self-reported ethnicity and radon testing with non-Hispanics (43%) more likely to test their homes for radon than Hispanics (32%). Conclusion(s): Individual and community understanding of the risks of exposure to radiation sources such as radon is dependent upon communication that informs and spurs appropriate action. This study demonstrates the need for culturally appropriate radon risk communication strategies targeted to a Hispanic population. Successful communication will raise awareness and knowledge that can lead to better public health protection.© 2020, Copyright © 2020 Taylor & Francis Group LLC.",Excluded

A finite element analysis of simulated eccentric forces using bone density data derived from CT Background and purpose: Radiotherapy is known to produce long-term skeletal complications. We aim to evaluate the biomechanical effect on femoral neck bone from hypothetical eccentric loads on pre- and post-radiotherapy CT-images for patients treated for rectal cancer. Material(s) and Method(s): Pre- and post-radiotherapy CT-images of rectal cancer from 10 patients were selected randomly. The cortical and trabecular bone was segmented by hand. The biomechanical simulations of 4 eccentric loads and one load aligned with the femoral neck axis were completed using finite element analysis (FEA) in both pre- and post-patient models. Result(s): A comparative statistical study was completed of pre- and post-radiotherapy patient models of stress and displacement factors. Significant differences were found in eccentric loads in both factors. Natural load has a significant difference in stress, but no differences were found for displacements. The absolute difference in eccentric load applied to the anterior area location on the same patient implies from 5.3% to 40.5% of the stress yield values reported in previous studies. Conclusion(s): Loads applied to the anterior area of the femoral head must be considered in fracture simulations because the percentage of yield stress of pre- and post-irradiated bones shows a significant biomechanical change.Copyright © 2021 Elsevier Inc.",Excluded

The rate of recovery in tumours (t1/2 = 0.31 +/- 0.15 h for local control) was significantly faster than in skin (t1/2 = 0.96 +/- 0.10 h). By contrast, the fractionation sensitivity of CaNT tumours was less than that of skin (alpha/beta = 43.3 +/- 8.5 Gy vs. alpha/beta = 7.9 +/- 0.2 Gy). Tissues with recovery half-times similar to or longer than that determined for skin would be at risk if interfraction intervals less than 6 h are used in regimes which involve the use of two or more fractions per day. This would be especially true for tissues that show a greater sensitivity to dose fractionation, and hence more sparing of radiation damage with hyperfractionation.",Excluded
2862,"Predictors of Radiotherapy Induced Bone Injury (RIBI) after stereotactic lung radiotherapy Background: The purpose of this study was to identify clinical and dosimetric factors associated with radiotherapy induced bone injury (RIBI) following stereotactic lung radiotherapy. Method(s): Inoperable patients with early stage non-small cell lung cancer, treated with SBRT, who received 54 or 60 Gy in 3 fractions, and had a minimum of 6 months follow up were reviewed. Archived treatment plans were retrieved, ribs delineated individually and treatment plans re-computed using heterogeneity correction. Clinical and dosimetric factors were evaluated for their association with rib fracture using logistic regression analysis; a dose-event curve and nomogram were created. Result(s): 46 consecutive patients treated between Oct 2004 and Dec 2008 with median follow-up 25 months (m) (range 6 - 51 m) were eligible. 41 fractured ribs were detected in 17 patients; median time to fracture was 21 m (range 7 - 40 m). The mean maximum point dose in non-fractured ribs (n = 1054) was 10.5 Gy +/- 10.2 Gy, this was higher in fractured ribs (n = 41) 48.5 Gy +/- 24.3 Gy (p < 0.0001). On univariate analysis, age, dose to 0.5 cc of the ribs (D0.5), and the volume of the rib receiving at least 25 Gy (V25), were significantly associated with RIBI. As D0.5 and V25 were cross-correlated (Spearman correlation coefficient: 0.57, p < 0.001), we selected D0.5 as a representative dose parameter. On multivariate analysis, age (odds ratio: 1.121, 95% CI: 1.04 - 1.21, p = 0.003), female gender (odds ratio: 4.43, 95% CI: 1.68 - 11.68, p = 0.003), and rib D0.5 (odds ratio: 1.0009, 95% CI: 1.0007 - 1.001, p < 0.0001) were significantly associated with rib fracture.Using D0.5, a dose-event curve was constructed estimating risk of fracture from dose at the median follow up of 25 months after treatment. In our cohort, a 50% risk of rib fracture was associated with a D0.5 of 60 Gy. Conclusion(s): Dosimetric and clinical factors contribute to risk of RIBI and both should be included when modeling risk of toxicity. A nomogram is presented using D0.5, age, and female gender to estimate risk of RIBI following SBRT. This requires validation. © 2012 Taremi et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",Excluded

The study hypothesis stated that sonographic imaging of the AIIS correlates well to AIIS morphology seen on false profile radiographs. METHOD(S): Fifty-three hips in 30 consecutive patients met the inclusion criteria. A single, fellowship trained, orthopedic surgeon performed an ultrasound on all of the patients to evaluate the AIIS morphology. The patients underwent standing false profile radiographs. The US and radiographic images were independently reviewed and classified according to Hetsroni classification of AIIS morphology by two senior, fellowship trained, orthopedic surgeons. Agreement between the two raters was calculated for each imaging modality (inter-rater agreement) as well as the agreement between the rating in each modality by the same rater (""inter-method"" agreement). RESULT(S): The agreement between the raters (inter-rater agreement) for morphologic evaluation of the AIIS by means of FP view was 88.8% (p<0.001) and that by means of US was 81.5%(p<0.001).

All patients underwent one-stop combined scans on a 256-row CT scanner with automatic tube current modulation, 50 % pre-ASIR-V to control radiation dose. CCTA was performed first using one heartbeat axial scan mode with bolus tracking technique and iliac CTA was performed 3 s after CCTA using a spiral scan. The conventional group (n = 72) used the standard protocol: 100 kVp, 60 mL of 350 mgI/mL CM at 4.5 mL/s flow rate. The individualized group (n = 76) used a body-mass-index (BMI)-dependent protocol: kVp: 80 (BMI < 24) and 100 (BMI >= 24) and CM: 19 mgI/kg (BMI < 18); 21 mgI/kg (18 <= BMI < 24); and 22 mgI/kg (BMI >= 24). Image quality radiation and CM doses of the two groups were compared. Result(s): There was no significant difference in patient demographic data. Compared with the conventional group, the individualized group reduced contrast flow rate (in mL/s) by 14.4 % (3.85 +/- 0.72 vs. 4.5), contrast dose (in mL) by 35.8 % (38.53 +/- 7.18 vs. 60) and radiation dose (in mSv) by 34.3 % (4.30 +/- 1.73 vs. 6.54 +/- 1.45).

87,"The QUANTEC criteria for parotid gland dose and their efficacy to prevent moderate to severe patient-rated xerostomia Background. Recently, the Quantitative Analysis of Normal Tissue Effect in the Clinic (QUANTEC) Group defined dose-volume constraints for the parotid glands to avoid severe xerostomia. The aim of this study was to determine if application of these QUANTEC criteria also protected against moderate-to-severe patient-rated xerostomia. Material and methods. The study population consisted of 307 head and neck cancer patients treated with primary (chemo)radiotherapy, either with 3D-CRT (56%) or with IMRT (44%). All patients participated in a standard follow-up program in which radiation-induced toxicity and quality of life were prospectively assessed. Patients who met the QUANTEC criteria were classified as low risk and otherwise as high risk. Results. In total, 41% of the patients (treated with 3D-CRT and IMRT) were classified as low risk patients. In the group treated with 3D-CRT and IMRT, it was possible to meet the QUANTEC criteria in 47% and 32% of the patients, respectively. Sparing the parotid glands with IMRT was considerably more difficult in patients with lymph node metastases and in patients with nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal tumours. Low risk patients reported significantly less moderate-to-severe xerostomia than high risk patients. However, the predicted risk of elderly patients and patients with pre-existing minor patient-rated xerostomia at baseline was > 20%, even when the QUANTEC criteria were met. Conclusions. Significantly lower rates of radiation-induced patient-rated xerostomia were found among low risk patients treated according to the QUANTEC criteria, but these criteria do not completely protect against xerostomia. Particularly in elderly patients and patients already suffering from minor xerostomia at baseline, the QUANTEC criteria do not sufficiently protect against persistent, moderate-to-severe patient-rated xerostomia. © 2014 Informa Healthcare.",Excluded

This study was conducted to evaluate the mechanisms that induce the effect of gamma irradiation on metacestodes of T. solium. Metacestodes were obtained from several infected pigs and irradiated with a dose of 0.3 kGy. The viability of the metacestodes was evaluated by their capacity to evaginate in vitro and in vivo development to tapeworms after they were orally infected into prednisolone-treated golden hamsters. Using the typical ladder pattern of fragmented DNA and the TdT-mediated DUTP-nick-end labeling assay, apoptosis was evaluated in metacestodes after irradiation and in the scolices and tapeworms recovered from infected hamsters at 21 days post-infection. Apoptosis was observed in the structure of scolices obtained from hamsters at 21 days post-infection with irradiated metacestodes, This study provides evidence of the existence of apoptosis in the irradiated metacestodes of T. solium and helps elucidate the possible mechanisms that are involved when gamma irradiation inhibits the normal development of the T. solium metacestode into the adult worm.",Excluded

OBJECTIVES: Pre-pectoral breast reconstruction is a less invasive technique compared to dual plane technique and shows promise in improving patient outcomes. This study compares hospital length of stay (LOS) and post-operative outcomes of pre-pectoral (PP) and dual plane (DP) techniques of breast reconstruction. METHOD(S): This single-site, retrospective cohort study included data from breast reconstruction procedures from June 2013 to March 2016. Data collected included demographics, chemotherapy/radiation exposure, surgical technique, LOS, drain usage, post-operative incision care and 90 day post-operative complications. Two-sided T-test and Chi-square or Fisher's Exact tests were performed at alpha = 0.05. RESULT(S): The study included data on 176 patients (DP=117, PP=59) and 335 breasts (DP=225, PP=110). The PP group had a higher BMI (29.5 vs. 26.3 kg/m2; p=0.0017), and a significantly higher proportion of patients with diabetes (13.6% vs. 2.6%; p=0.0073), hypertension (35.6% vs. 17.1%; p=0.0061), and prior breast surgery (36.8% vs. 22.2%; p=0.0415). A higher proportion of PP patients received ciNPT (57.6% vs. 25.6%; p< 0.0001) compared to the DP group. There were no differences in complication rates between the two groups. The PP group had a significantly lower LOS compared to DP (mean: 1.1 vs. 1.8 days, p< 0.0001). Nearly 95% of PP patients were discharged after 1 hospital day compared to only 25.6% of the DP patients (p< 0.0001). Results of multiple regression models were similar to the univariate analyses after controlling for effects of age, BMI, ciNPT use, diabetes, hypertension and prior breast surgery.

Complication rates were similar between the two groups even though the PP group was more complex. Studies with a long-term follow up will be critical in understanding the true differences between surgical technique and clinical outcomes.",Excluded
2463,"Rapid detection of radiation-induced chromosomal aberrations in lymphocytes and hematopoietic progenitor cells by mFISH Structural chromosome aberrations (SCAs) are sensitive indicators of a preceding exposure of the hematopoietic system to ionizing radiation. Cytogenetic investigations have therefore become routine tools for an assessment of absorbed radiation doses and their biological effects after occupational exposure or radiation accidents.Due to its speed and ease of use, fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) with whole chromosome painting (WCP) probes has become a method of choice to visualize SCAs. Until recently, this technique was limited to a rather small number of chromosomes, which could be tested simultaneously. As a result, only a fraction of the structural aberrations present in a sample could be detected and the overall dose effect had to be calculated by extrapolation. The recent introduction of two genome-wide screening techniques in tumor research, i.e., Spectral Karyotyping (SKY) and multicolor FISH (mFISH) now allows the detection of translocations involving any two non-homologous chromosomes.The present study was prompted by our desire to bring the power of mFISH to bear for the rapid identification of radiation-induced SCAs. We chose two model systems to investigate the utility of mFISH: lymphocytes that were exposed in vitro to 3 Gy photons and single hematopoietic progenitor cell colonies isolated from a Chernobyl victim 9 years after in vivo exposure to 5.4 Sv.In lymphocytes, we found up to 15 different chromosomes involved in rearrangements indicating complex radiation effects. Stable aberrations detected in hematopoietic cell colonies, on the other hand, showed involvement of up to three different chromosomes. These results demonstrated that mFISH is a rapid and powerful approach to detect and characterize radiation-induced SCAs in the hemopoietic system. The application of mFISH is expected to result in a more detailed and, thus, more informative picture of radiation effects. Eventually, this technique will allow researchers to rapidly delineate chromosomal breakpoints and facilitate the identification of the genes involved in radiation tumorigenesis.

Patients and Methods: From 1988 to 2011, 218 patients were treated with 30-30.6 Gy (1.8-2 Gy per fraction), 39.6-40 Gy (1.8-2 Gy per fraction) or 44-45 Gy (1.8-2 Gy per fraction) and concomitant cisplatin + 5-fluorouracil (5-FU), oxaliplatin + 5-FU or 5-FU alone. The most commonly used concomitant chemotherapy was continuous infusion of 5-FU-Alone with a dose of 300 mg/m2/day during the whole course of treatment (n=111). To eliminate the dispersing effect of potentially different efficacy levels of these drug regimens on pCR, we excluded patients with regimens other than 5-FU-Alone. Result(s): Histomorphological regression grade 1a (0% residual tumor), 1b (<10% residual tumor), 2 (10-50% residual tumor) and 3 (>50% residual tumor) was observed in 26 (23%), 24 (22%), 36 (32%) and 25 (23%) patients, respectively. pCR was observed in 9 out of 71 (13%) patients treated with 30 Gy-30.6 Gy, 13 of 34 (38%) patients treated with 39.6-40 Gy and 4 of 6 (67%) patients treated with 44-45 Gy (p=0.001). Median follow-up time from the start of N-RCT was 191 months (range=2-262 months). The estimated 5-year overall survival (OS) was 33% for the whole cohort. OS at 5 years was 58% for patients with pCR compared to 25% for patients with less favorable response to N-RCT (p=0.009), respectively. Conclusion(s): The dose of radiation correlates significantly with the likelihood of achieving a pCR in stage II/III squamous cell esophageal cancer patients. Prospective randomized trials are required to definitively evaluate the impact of application of higher radiation doses on efficacy and safety/tolerability in the context of N-RCT on the clinical outcomes.",Excluded
2280,"Low-dose CT with automatic tube current modulation, adaptive statistical iterative reconstruction, and low tube voltage for the diagnosis of renal colic: Impact of body mass index OBJECTIVE. The objective of our study was to evaluate the impact of body mass index (BMI) on dose, diagnostic performance, and image quality of a low-dose CT examination for renal colic. MATERIALS AND METHODS. This retrospective study included all patients who underwent a low-dose CT examination for renal colic performed during the year 2012 with automatic tube current modulation, adaptive statistical iterative reconstruction, and a low tube voltage (kV). Three readers independently reviewed all images for the presence of renal colic and evaluated diagnostic confidence and image quality. The results and doses were compared among patients grouped by body mass index (BMI) and between patients with a BMI < 25 and those with a BMI >= 25. RESULTS. Eighty-six patients were included in the study: 39 patients had a BMI < 25 and 47 had a BMI >= 25. No statistically significant difference was found between the accuracy rates for the diagnosis of renal colic when the rates of the three independent readers were averaged for both BMI groups (95.7% vs 96.4%, respectively; p = 0.83). Image quality and diagnostic confidence scores were significantly better for patients with a BMI >= 25 than for patients with a BMI < 25 (mean image quality score, 3.7 vs 3.4, p < 0.001; mean diagnostic confidence score, 2.8 vs 2.5, p < 0.001). The mean radiation dose for patients with a BMI < 25 was 2.4 mGy compared with 3.7 mGy for patients with a BMI >= 25 ( p < 0.001). CONCLUSION. The diagnostic performance of our low-dose CT protocol for renal colic was excellent for all patients, and image quality and diagnostic confidence were significantly better for patients with a BMI >= 25. However, our protocol also required exposure to a greater dose of radiation for these overweight and obese patients. © American Roentgen Ray Society.",Excluded
2190,"Comparison of Interlaminar and Transforaminal Approaches for Treatment of L5/S1 Disc Herniation by Percutaneous Endoscopic Discectomy Objective: The aim of this study was to compare the clinical efficacy of percutaneous endoscopic interlaminar discectomy (PEID) and percutaneous endoscopic transforaminal discectomy (PETD) in treating L5/S1 disc herniation. Method(s): A retrospective analysis of 76 patients with L5/S1 intervertebral disc herniation was performed. There were two surgical treatment groups: one with patients receiving PEID and the other with patients receiving PETD. The two groups were compared by length of surgery, times of intraoperative X-ray exposure, postoperative time in bed, length of hospital stay, operative complications, patient's assessment of pain using a visual analogue scale (VAS), and disability using the Oswestry disability index (ODI) before and after surgery. Result(s): Subjects in the PEID group were in surgery for 60.90 +/- 13.11 min and needed intraoperative X-ray exposure 4.10 +/- 1.09 times. Patients in this group were ambulatory by 7.52 +/- 1.08 h after surgery and were hospitalized for 5.05 +/- 0.92 days. In contrast, patients in the PETD group were in surgery for 84.06 +/- 15.58 min and needed intraoperative X ray exposure 12.81 +/- 8.46 times. These patients were ambulatory by 7.06 +/- 0.91 h after surgery and remained in the hospital for 4.94 +/- 0.80 days. Based on these data, operation time and fluoroscopy time were significantly less (P < 0.002 and P < 0.001, respectively) for subjects in the PEID group. However, ambulatory time and hospitalization were similar for both in terms of pain relief and decreased disability, and subjects in both groups responded well to the surgery and showed a significant decrease in both VAS and ODI scores at their 1-year follow-up (P < 0.01). Furthermore, there were no statistically significant differences between the two surgeries in terms of pain relief and decrease in disability. Conclusion(s): For L5/S1 disc herniation, PEID and PETD provide similar results for patients. However, PEID has the advantage over PETD in that it is a shorter procedure and exposes the patient to less radiation. Keywords.Copyright © 2020 The Authors.

The 27 patients with radiotherapy had a conventional dosage, 220 cGy per fraction, or less. The median interval between the completion of radiotherapy and the evaluation of neuropsychological function was 1.7 years. Groups were matched for age and educational level. The results showed that our NPC group with radiotherapy had neuropsychological impairments in the areas of auditory attention/concentration, immediate and delayed verbal recall and immediate visual recall, and recent memory, higher-order visuospatial abilities, and bimanual dexterity. Thus neuropsychological dysfunction may occur in patients with NPC within the first 2 years after radiotherapy.",Included
279,"Role for the mammalian Swi5-Sfr1 complex in DNA strand break repair through homologous recombination In fission yeast, the Swi5-Sfr1 complex plays an important role in homologous recombination (HR), a pathway crucial for the maintenance of genomic integrity. Here we identify and characterize mammalian Swi5 and Sfr1 homologues. Mouse Swi5 and Sfr1 are nuclear proteins that form a complex in vivo and in vitro. Swi5 interacts in vitro with Rad51, the DNA strand-exchange protein which functions during HR. By generating Swi5(-/-) and Sfr1(-/-) embryonic stem cell lines, we found that both proteins are mutually interdependent for their stability. Importantly, the Swi5-Sfr1 complex plays a role in HR when Rad51 function is perturbed in vivo by expression of a BRC peptide from BRCA2. Swi5(-/-) and Sfr1(-/-) cells are selectively sensitive to agents that cause DNA strand breaks, in particular ionizing radiation, camptothecin, and the Parp inhibitor olaparib. Consistent with a role in HR, sister chromatid exchange induced by Parp inhibition is attenuated in Swi5(-/-) and Sfr1(-/-) cells, and chromosome aberrations are increased. Thus, Swi5-Sfr1 is a newly identified complex required for genomic integrity in mammalian cells with a specific role in the repair of DNA strand breaks.",Excluded
3228,"Overwhelming support among urban Irish COPD patients for lung cancer screening by low-dose CT scan PURPOSE: The National Lung Screening Trial (NLST) has renewed interest in low-dose computed tomography (LDCT) screening for lung cancer. Smokers may be less receptive toward LDCT screening, however, compared with never smokers. The views of patients with COPD, a particularly high-risk group, toward LDCT screening for lung cancer are currently unknown. We therefore evaluated attitudes of patients with COPD toward LDCT screening for lung cancer., METHODS: Interviews with Irish patients with COPD who satisfied NLST eligibility criteria were conducted in clinical settings using a questionnaire based on that of a comparable study of U.S. current/former smokers of unspecified disease status., RESULTS: A total of 142 subjects had a mean age of 65.09 +/- 6.07 years (46.4 % were male, mean pack years 54.5 +/- 33.3, mean FEV1 59.16 +/- 23 %); 97.8 % had an identifiable usual source of healthcare. Compared with data from a U.S. cohort of current/former smokers, a higher proportion of Irish COPD smokers: believed that they were at risk for lung cancer (63.6 vs. 15.7 %); believed that early detection improved chances of survival (90 vs. 51.2 ); were willing to consider LDCT screening (97.9 vs. 78.6 %); were willing to pay for a LDCT scan (68.6 vs. 36.2 %); and were willing to accept treatment recommendations arising (95.7 vs. 56.2 %; p < 0.0001 for all comparisons)., CONCLUSIONS: Urban Irish smokers with COPD who would be eligible for LDCT screening are almost universally in favor of being screened and treated for screening-detected lung cancers. This readily accessible high-risk population should be actively targeted in future screening programs.",Excluded
2688,"Radiation therapy for extramammary paget disease: Treatment outcomes and prognostic factors Purpose/Objective(s): Extramammary Paget disease (EMPD) is a relatively rare cutaneous malignancy that primarily affects the genital regions, such as the vulva and scrotum, of the elderly. Although wide surgical excision is the standard curative treatment for EMPD, it is frequently unsuitable due to old age or severe coexisting disease. Radiation therapy is considered a possible treatment option for these patients, but to date there have been few studies that have presented treatment results. Consequently, we have investigated the outcome of radiation therapy in EMPD. Materials/Methods: Thirty-six patients with EMPD received radiation therapy with curative intent. Of these patients, 13 were men and 23 were women, and their median age at irradiation was 74 years (range, 52-94 years). The primary tumor sites were the perineum in 13 patients, vulva in 12, scrotum in 10, and penis in one. Twelve patients had regional lymph node metastases prior to radiation therapy, but none had distant metastasis. Total radiation doses of 45-80.2 Gy (median, 60 Gy) were delivered to tumor sites in 23-43 fractions (median, 33 fractions) with fraction sizes of 1.8-2.2 Gy (median, 1.8 Gy). Result(s): All irradiated tumors had disappeared macroscopically by 2-9 months after irradiation, and the initial complete response rate was 100%. However, 14 of the 36 patients developed recurrences, including four with local progression within the radiation field and 11 with lymph node or/and distant metastases outside the radiation field, during follow-up periods of 2-150 months (median, 40 months). All but one of the 11 patients with regional lymph node or distant metastases after irradiation exhibited tumor invasion into the dermis, whereas of the 15 patients without tumor invasion into the dermis, none had regional lymph node metastasis and only one had distant metastasis after irradiation. The local progression-free and diseasefree rates were 86% and 53%, respectively at 3 years and 86% and 45%, respectively at 5 years. Nine patients died at 6-73 months after irradiation; the causes of death were tumor progression in five patients, infectious pneumonia in two, renal failure in one and old age in one. The overall and cause-specific survival rates were 93% and 95%, respectively at 3 years and 61% and 80%, respectively at 5 years. Tumor invasion into the dermis was a statistically significant prognostic factor for both distant metastasis (p = 0.004) and survival (p = 0.005). No therapy-related toxicities of grade 3 or greater were observed. Conclusion(s): Radiation therapy was found to be safe and effective for patients with EMPD. It appeared to contribute to prolonged survival through good tumor control, and to be a promising curative treatment option.",Excluded
669,"Helicobacter gastritis induces changes in the oxyntic mucosa indistinguishable from the effects of proton pump inhibitors A causal relationship between oxyntic glands dilatation with protruding parietal cells, referred to as proton pump inhibitor (PPI) effects, and PPI use has been suspected but not established. We designed this study to evaluate the association between these changes and the use of PPIs and histamine 2-receptor blockers (H2-blockers). We obtained five Sydney System-compliant biopsy specimens from patients recruited into a therapeutic trial for H. pylori. Medication history with details on PPI and H 2-blockers use was collected. Two blinded pathologists graded gastritis and the intensity of putative PPI effects using a 0 to 3 scale. PPI and H2-blocker use was then disclosed and the accuracy of pathologists' assessment was analyzed. There were 138 H. pylori-negative and 104 positive patients. In H. pylori-negative patients the histologic assessment for PPI use had 77.5% sensitivity and 51.8% specificity, with a positive predictive value of 86.9% and a negative predictive value of 35.9%. In H. pylori-positive patients, sensitivity was 74.1% and specificity 26.1%. Positive and negative predictive values were 55.8% and 44.4%, respectively. Neither glandular dilatations nor parietal cell protrusions related to H2-blocker use. We conclude that these changes are associated with PPI use only in H. pylori-negative subjects. In H. pylori gastritis, so-called PPI-effects were equally prevalent in PPI-users and non-users, indicating that other factors are involved in the induction of oxyntic cell hyperplasia. We suggest that comments regarding the supposed evidence of PPI use are too often wrong to be useful and should be avoided in the diagnosis of gastric biopsy specimens. © 2013 Elsevier Inc.

A preliminary report of Radiation Therapy Oncology Group 83-02 BACKGROUND: The third and final randomization of Radiation Therapy Oncology Group (RTOG) 83-02 was performed to identify the maximal tolerated dose and potential efficacy of accelerated hyperfractionated radiation therapy (AHRT) in 1.6 Gy twice-daily fractions for adult malignant glioma., METHODS: From December 1987 to July 1989, 304 patients with malignant glioma were stratified by age, performance status, and histologic findings and randomized to receive total AHRT doses of 48.0 or 54.4 Gy, with 80 mg/m2 of bis-chloroethyl nitrosourea (BCNU) for 3 days every 8 weeks. Distribution of other prognostic factors, including neurologic function, extent of surgery, tumor size, and sex, was comparable in each treatment arm., RESULTS: One Grade 5 radiation therapy (RT)-related toxic effect was reported (in the 54.4-Gy treatment arm), and the incidence of late Grade 3-5 RT-related toxic effects at 18 months was 1% at 48.0 Gy and 4% at 54.4 Gy. The median survival times (MST) for the 48.0 Gy and 54.4 Gy treatment arms were 11.7 and 10.8 months, respectively, comparable to the MST in prior RTOG trials with a similar proportion of patients with glioblastoma multiforme (79%). For the 123 patients who were 60 years of age or older, the MST for the 48.0 Gy and 54.4 Gy treatment arms were 8.9 and 10.4 months, respectively, and compare favorably with the MST of 6.0 months reported with standard RT and BCNU treatment used for 101 patients who were 60 years of age or older in two prior RTOG malignant glioma trials (74-01 and 79-18). Although these results differ significantly (P = 0.0015), this contrast is not significant when adjusted by performance status., CONCLUSIONS: The maximum tolerated dose of AHRT has yet to be identified, and pursuit of this information may most benefit patients with malignant glioma who are 60 years of age or older.",Excluded
1794,"Anatomy versus physiology-guided ablation for persistent atrial fibrillation Background: Pulmonary vein isolation remains the cornerstone of atrial fibrillation (AF) ablation. However, due to high recurrence rates, especially in patients with persistent AF, PV antral isolation, complemented by linear ablation, autonomic modulation, and ablation of complex fractionated electrograms, have been attempted to increase the odds of success. However, the optimum approach for a complementary strategy in addition to PVI for persistent AF is unknown. Method(s): We performed a prospective randomized trial by assigning 92 patients with persistent AF in 1:1 ratio to pulmonary-vein isolation plus ablation of electrograms showing complex fractionated activity (45 patients), or pulmonary-vein isolation plus additional linear ablation across the left atrial roof and mitral valve isthmus (47 patients). The duration of follow-up was five years. The primary endpoint was freedom from any documented recurrence of atrial fibrillation after a single ablation procedure. Result(s): At a 12-month follow-up, 9 (23%) patients had AF recurrence in the linear ablation and 8 (21%) patients in the CFAE groups. At a mean follow-up duration of 59+/-36 months, 48.3% of patients in the linear ablation group and 44.6% of patients in the CFAE group were free from AF (p=0.403). There were no significant differences between the two groups for independent predictors of freedom from AF. The overall procedure time and radiation exposure were higher in the PVI+linear ablation group. There were five adverse events noted, two in the linear group (pericardial effusion not requiring drain) and 3 in the CFAE group (1 pseudoaneurysm, one effusion requiring pericardiocentesis and one effusion nor requiring drain). Conclusion(s): Among patients with persistent atrial fibrillation, we found no difference in maintenance of sinus rhythm in either linear ablation or ablation of complex fractionated electrograms was performed in addition to pulmonary vein isolation in short- and long-term follow-up.Copyright © 2020 CardioFront LLC.

69,"Changes in boundary extension effect during spatial confinement Changes in perception during space missions are usually attributed to microgravity. However, additional factors, such as spatial confinement, may contribute to changes in perception. We tested changes in scene perception using a boundary extension (BE) paradigm during a 105-day Earth-based space-simulation study. In addition to the close-up/wide-angle views used in BE, we presented two types of scenes based on the distance from the observer (proximal/distant scenes). In crew members (n = 6), we found that BE partly increased over time, but the size of BE error did not change in the control group (n = 22). We propose that this effect is caused by an increasing BE effect in stimuli that depict distant scenes and is related to spatial confinement. The results might be important for other situations of spatial confinement with restricted visual depth (e.g., submarine crew, patients confined to a bed). Generally, we found a larger BE effect in proximal scenes compared with the distant scenes. We also demonstrated that with no feedback, subjects preserve the level of the BE effect during repeated measurements. © 2014 © 2014 Taylor & Francis.",Excluded
3408,"Definition of an optimal model based on segments' contribution for the estimation of the acceleration of the center of mass in people with lower-limb amputation Introduction In the context of rehabilitation of people with amputation, gait analysis provides information about gait alterations. In that perspective, the body center of mass (BCoM) trajectory, or its derivatives, can be used to describe how the whole body moves (Cavagna and Kaneko 1977). It is generally obtained using force plates or an optical motion capture system (OMC). However, these instruments are constrained to laboratory use. Magneto-Inertial measurement units (MIMUs) are wearable sensors that allow BCoM kinematics assessment in every-day life conditions (Pavei et al. 2020): first, the BCoM acceleration can be obtained from a weighted average of segments' center of mass (sCoM) accelerations, using MIMUs located on the segments, and then, the BCoM trajectory is estimated by integration of the obtained acceleration. Finding a balance between a limited number of sensors and good accuracy is crucial. In this respect, Shahabpoor et al. (2018) recently proposed a method to select a reduced number of MIMUs for the estimation of the 3D BCoM acceleration. However, the methodology was not applied in people with lower-limb amputation. This study aims at filling this gap. First, the most appropriate segments to include in the model are identified, then the accuracy of models based on different combinations of these segments was assessed using OMC data. 2. Methods 2.1. Experimental method The study was approved by the local ethical committee and 8 transfemoral amputees (6 males, 2 females, age: 40.8 +/- 12.6 years, mass: 70.8 +/- 17.5 kg) gave their written informed consent to participate in the study. According to the methodology reported in Al Abiad et al. (2020), the 3D trajectory of 59 reflective markers located on patients' anatomical landmarks were acquired with OMC during walking, and combined with static EOS-based biplanar x-rays acquisition. 2.2. Data processing A 15-segments hybrid inertial model constructed according to Al Abiad et al. (2020), was used to obtain sCoM inertial parameters. sCoM accelerations were obtained from OMC, and reference BCoM acceleration was obtained using the abovementioned inertial model. The contribution of each segment in the BCoM acceleration was defined as the acceleration of the sCoM, weighted by the relative mass of the segment in the body (1) Then, for each subject, Pearson's cross-correlations of sCoM accelerations were computed for each pair of segments and between each sCoM and BCoM accelerations over a complete gait cycle, for the anteroposterior (AP), mediolateral (ML) and vertical (V) directions. For each direction, the cross-correlation matrices were averaged over all subjects. These steps allowed to define the most relevant contributing segments to the BCoM acceleration to construct a MIMUs-based experimental model with a minimal number of segments (MiNuM model). The mass of the non-selected segments was attributed to the main contributors based on sCoM accelerations cross-correlations (Shahabpoor et al. 2018). MiNuM models were validated against the reference BCoM using a leave-one-out methodology. Reference and MiNuM-based BCoM accelerations were compared over the central prosthetic gait cycle of each trial using Pearson's correlation coefficients and peak-to-peak normalized root-mean square errors (NRMSE), averaged over all patients. 3. Results and discussion A total of 22 gait cycles were analysed for the 8 participants. Trunk, pelvis, both thighs and both feet were considered as the best sensor locations to be considered (Figure 1). Finally, different MiNuM models were built (see 'Segment included' column in Table 1). Leave-one-out validation results are summarized in Table 1. The optimal MiNuM model for transfemoral amputees is based on 5 segments, i.e., trunk, both thighs and both feet. Indeed, it presented results similar to improved compared to those presented in Shahabpoor et al. (2018) in healthy subjects using the 3-sensor configuration (16%, 7%, 18% in AP, V, ML respectively) and provided a good compromise between accuracy and reduced number of sensors. 4. Conclusions This study allowed to obtain insight on the best location of sensors for 3D BCoM acceleration estimation in people with transfemoral amputation. It is worth to underline that the achieved results rely on the localization of sCoM using EOS imaging and were obtained using acceleration data derived from OMC markers. When using MIMUs, one may be confronted with additional sources of errors such as softtissue artefacts that could affect the obtained results. Therefore, the accuracy obtained using actual MIMUs as well as methodologies to correctly identify MIMU positions relative to the sCoM represent research tracks of interest.",Excluded

Methods and Materials: Between January 1970 and August 1982, 45 patients with locally advanced carcinoma of the larynx were treated with primary radiation using a unique hypofractionated schedule of 2 fractions of 11 Gy separated by 21 days, with concomitant HBO-4 during each radiotherapy session. To avoid seizures, discomfort and other complications of HBO-4, each session was performed under general anesthesia. All patients had pathologically confirmed squamous cell carcinoma of the glottic (23) or supraglottic larynx (22) and were staged as follows: T2-5, T3-24, T-4-16; N0-26, N1-4, N2-13, N3-1. Patients were treated with opposed lateral wedged fields of 4-6MV photons, with a median field size of 5.5 x 9.75 to a total median dose of 22.5 Gy. Result(s): As of February 1998, follow-up was complete on all but one patient, who relocated to another country after 8 years. Complete clinical responses were observed in 39 (87%) of the cases. The 10-year local control rate for all 45 patients was 58%, and local control for the complete responders was 69%. Three patients underwent laryngectomy for complications and were found to have no pathological evidence of disease in the laryngectomy specimen. The 10-year survival of the overall population was 27%. The 10-year voice preservation rate for the the 39 complete responders was 55%. Acute mucosal and skin reactions were modest and acceptable. Significant late complications occurred in 14 patients consisting of severe fibrosis, necrosis, pharyngeal fistula, with 3 patients requiring laryngectomy for complications. The actuarial rate of severe complications at 5 years was 42%. Conclusion(s): The response rate and long-term tumor control rate obtained with this treatment program were comparable to more protracted radiation schedules with or without systemic chemotherapy. The complication rate was high resulting in an adverse therapeutic ratio.

Dose escalation was performed toward the maximal PD using secondary endpoint constraints for the lung, spinal cord, and heart, with de-escalation according to defined esophageal tolerance. Dose calculation was performed using the Eclipse pencil beam algorithm, and all plans were recalculated using a collapsed cone algorithm. The normal tissue complication probabilities were calculated for the lung (Grade 2 pneumonitis) and esophagus (acute toxicity, grade 2 or greater, and late toxicity)., RESULTS: IMRT resulted in statistically significant decreases in the mean lung (p <.0001) and maximal spinal cord (p = .002 and 0005) doses, allowing an average increase in the PD of 8.6-14.2 Gy (p <=.0001). This advantage was lost after de-escalation within the defined esophageal dose limits. The lung normal tissue complication probabilities were significantly lower for IMRT (p <.0001), even after dose escalation. For esophageal toxicity, IMRT significantly decreased the acute NTCP values at the low dose levels (p = .0009 and p <.0001). After maximal dose escalation, late esophageal tolerance became critical (p <.0001), especially when using IMRT, owing to the parallel increases in the esophageal dose and PD., CONCLUSION: In LA-NSCLC, IMRT offers the potential to significantly escalate the PD, dependent on the lung and spinal cord tolerance. However, parallel increases in the esophageal dose abolished the advantage, even when using collapsed cone algorithms. This is important to consider in the context of concomitant chemoradiotherapy schedules using IMRT. Copyright © 2011 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.",Excluded

We generated hypoperfused regions where pre-specified volumes were simulated for various areas in SPECT images. The properties of each NDB were evaluated based on the distribution of the standard deviation (SD). Abnormal accumulation regions were validated using Z, extent, and artifactual scores. Detection error was used to evaluate the optimal Butterworth pre-filter cutoff frequency with the perfusion defect rate (PDR) in 3D-SSP., RESULTS: The SD distribution was the same in the novel NDB and in the NDB constructed in-house, and the SD of the peak distribution was 0.08-0.07. The Z and extent scores of the novel DB and the NDB constructed in-house were similar, but increased along with the artifactual scores when using the conventional NDB. Many artifacts appeared in the Z score map when using the conventional NDB. The detection error deviated from the actual value by -1.3% at a cutoff frequency of 0.58 cycles/cm and a PDR of 30%, which was the lowest. The cutoff frequency became lower or higher, and the low-perfusion defect rate increased according to the increasing detection error. The optimal cutoff frequency was between 0.52 and 0.58 cycles/cm., CONCLUSIONS: We generated a novel NDB according to the individual devices and compared it with a conventional and a NDB constructed in-house. The Z and extent scores were essentially equal when using the novel DB and the NDB constructed in-house, but considerably differed when using the conventional NDB. The optimal cutoff frequency of the Butterworth filter evaluated from the detection error was in the range of 0.52-0.58 cycles/cm. The detection error increased the perfusion defect rate by <15% and this was undetectable in 3D-SSP. The next step will be to improve the accuracy of the extent of abnormal regions and the sensitivity of the Z score using a novel NDB constructed according to the individual devices.",Excluded
1400,"Effect of X-irradiation on epidermal immune function: decreased density and alloantigen-presenting capacity of Ia+ Langerhans cells and impaired production of epidermal cell-derived thymocyte activating factor (ETAF) The mechanisms involved in the modulation of cutaneous immune responses by UV radiation have been extensively investigated; by contrast, few studies have addressed the effects of x-irradiation on epidermal immune function. We therefore investigated the effect of x-irradiation of mice on: (a) the density of epidermal Ia+ Langerhans cells (LC) in immunofluorescence studies, (b) epidermal cell (EC) allostimulatory capacity in the allogeneic EC-lymphocyte reaction (ELR), and (c) production of epidermal cell-derived thymocyte activating factor (ETAF). C3H/He and BALB/c mice were irradiated with 900, 1,800, 2,700, or 3,600 rad from a 137Cs source, and sacrificed 10 h or 3 days later. X-irradiation of mice 10 h previously only slightly decreased the density of epidermal Ia+ LC and did not affect the capacity of their EC to stimulate allogeneic responder lymphocytes in the ELR. X-irradiation of mice 3 days previously, however, resulted in a dose-dependent decrease in the density of Ia+ LC. This decrease was accompanied by a substantial reduction in EC allostimulatory capacity in the ELR at all doses of x-irradiation. ETAF production by cultured EC from mice x-irradiated 3 days previously was also found to be diminished at all doses of x-irradiation. Trypan blue exclusion studies demonstrated that the observed decreases in EC allostimulatory capacity and ETAF production were not the result of a generalized lethal effect of x-irradiation on EC. The reduction in EC allostimulatory capacity following in vivo x-irradiation could not be reversed by addition of exogenous ETAF or interleukin-1 in the ELR. Taken together, these results indicate that x-irradiation decreases the density of Ia+ LC, impairs LC alloantigen-presenting function, and reduces ETAF production. Thus cutaneous x-irradiation may affect inflammatory and neoplastic processes not only by its antimitotic activity, but also by a direct effect on EC which subserve immunologic functions.",Included
2712,"Ultra-low-dose thoracic CT with model-based iterative reconstruction (MBIR) in cystic fibrosis patients undergoing treatment with cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulators (CFTR) AIM: To assess the utility of a volumetric low-dose computed tomography (CT) thorax (LDCTT) protocol at a dose equivalent to a posteroanterior (PA) and lateral chest radiograph for surveillance of cystic fibrosis (CF) patients. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A prospective study was undertaken of 19 adult patients with CF that proceeded to LDCTT at 12 and 24 months following initiation of ivacaftor. A previously validated seven-section, low-dose axial CT protocol was used for the 12-month study. A volumetric LDCTT protocol was developed for the 24-month study and reconstructed with hybrid iterative reconstruction (LD-ASIR) and pure iterative reconstruction (model-based IR [LD-MBIR]). Radiation dose was recorded for each scan. Image quality was assessed quantitatively and qualitatively, and disease severity was assessed using a modified Bhalla score. Statistical analysis was performed and p-values of <0.05 were considered statistically significant. RESULT(S): Volumetric LD-MBIR studies were acquired at a lower radiation dose than the seven-section studies (0.08 +/- 0.01 versus 0.10 +/- 0.02 mSv; p=0.02). LD-MBIR and seven-section ASIR images had significantly lower levels of image noise compared with LD-ASIR images (p<0.0001). Diagnostic acceptability scores and depiction of bronchovascular structures were found to be acceptable for axial and coronal LD-MBIR images. LD-MBIR images were superior to LD-ASIR images for all qualitative parameters assessed (p<0.0001). No significant change was observed in mean Bhalla score between 1-year and 2-year studies (p=0.84). CONCLUSION(S): The use of a volumetric LDCTT protocol (reconstructed with pure IR) enabled acquisition of diagnostic quality CT images, which were considered extremely useful for surveillance of CF patients, at a dose equivalent to a PA and lateral chest radiograph.Copyright © 2021 The Royal College of Radiologists",Excluded
3102,"Eye lens radiation exposure to interventional cardiologists: A retrospective assessment of cumulative doses Radiation dose to the eye lens is a crucial issue for interventional cardiologists (ICs) who are exposed during the procedures they perform. This paper presents a retrospective assessment of the cumulative eye lens doses of ICs enrolled in the O'CLOC study for Occupational Cataracts and Lens Opacities in interventional Cardiology. Information on the workload in the catheterisation laboratory, radiation protection equipment, eye lens dose per procedure and dose reduction factors associated with eye-protective equipment were considered. For the 129 ICs at an average age of 51 who had worked for an average period of 22 years, the estimated cumulative eye lens dose ranged from 25 mSv to more than 1600 mSv; the mean+SD was 423+359 mSv. After several years of practice, without eye protection, ICs may exceed the new ICRP lifetime eye dose threshold of 500 mSv and be at high risk of developing early radiation-induced cataracts. Radiation protection equipment can reduce these doses and should be used routinely. © The Author 2012. Published by Oxford University Press. All rights reserved.",Excluded

In all patients, dose-volumetric parameters were analyzed according to their relation to development of HT, and thyroid volumes spared from doses >=10, 20, 30, 40 and 50Gy (V10, V20, V30, V40 and V50) were analyzed from the dose volume histograms (DVHs)., RESULTS: Median follow-up duration was 31months. At the end of study, 33 patients (42.3%) developed HT and the cumulative incidence of HT was 24.6%, 36.5% and 42.3% at one, two and three years, respectively. V30 of 42.1% (P=0.005) was defined as dose-volumetric threshold of radiation-induced HT in HNSCC patients. Our analysis showed that V30 separates patients into low- and high-risk groups; the incidence of radiation-induced HT in the group with V30<42.1% and V30>=42.1% was 29.4% and 71.4%, respectively (P=0.002)., CONCLUSIONS: The V30 may predict risk of developing HT after RT for HNSCC patients. V30 of 42.1%, defined as dose-volumetric threshold of radiation-induced HT, can be useful in treatment planning of HNSCC patients. Copyright © 2018 National Cancer Institute, Cairo University.

2409,"Lower body negative pressure: Physiological effects, applications, and implementation This review presents lower body negative pressure (LBNP) as a unique tool to investigate the physiology of integrated systemic compensatory responses to altered hemodynamic patterns during conditions of central hypovolemia in humans. An early review published in Physiological Reviews over 40 yr ago (Wolthuis et al. Physiol Rev 54: 566-595, 1974) focused on the use of LBNP as a tool to study effects of central hypovolemia, while more than a decade ago a review appeared that focused on LBNP as a model of hemorrhagic shock (Cooke et al. J Appl Physiol (1985) 96: 1249-1261, 2004). Since then there has been a great deal of new research that has applied LBNP to investigate complex physiological responses to a variety of challenges including orthostasis, hemorrhage, and other important stressors seen in humans such as microgravity encountered during spaceflight. The LBNP stimulus has provided novel insights into the physiology underlying areas such as intolerance to reduced central blood volume, sex differences concerning blood pressure regulation, autonomic dysfunctions, adaptations to exercise training, and effects of space flight. Furthermore, approaching cardiovascular assessment using prediction models for orthostatic capacity in healthy populations, derived from LBNP tolerance protocols, has provided important insights into the mechanisms of orthostatic hypotension and central hypovolemia, especially in some patient populations as well as in healthy subjects. This review also presents a concise discussion of mathematical modeling regarding compensatory responses induced by LBNP. Given the diverse applications of LBNP, it is to be expected that new and innovative applications of LBNP will be developed to explore the complex physiological mechanisms that underline health and disease.Copyright © 2019 the American Physiological Society.",Excluded
198,"Long-term outcomes after radiosurgery for acoustic neuromas BACKGROUND: Stereotactic radiosurgery is the principal alternative to microsurgical resection for acoustic neuromas (vestibular schwannomas). The goals of radiosurgery are the long-term prevention of tumor growth, maintenance of neurologic function, and prevention of new neurologic deficits. Although acceptable short-term outcomes have been reported, long-term outcomes have not been well documented., METHODS: We evaluated 162 consecutive patients who underwent radiosurgery for acoustic neuromas between 1987 and 1992 by means of serial imaging tests, clinical evaluations, and a survey between 5 and 10 years after the procedure. The average dose of radiation to the tumor margin was 16 Gy, and the mean transverse diameter of the tumor was 22 mm (range, 8 to 39). Resection had been performed previously in 42 patients (26 percent); in 13 patients the tumor represented a recurrence of disease after a previous total resection. Facial function was normal in 76 percent of the patients before radiosurgery, and 20 percent had useful hearing., RESULTS: The rate of tumor control (with no resection required) was 98 percent. One hundred tumors (62 percent) became smaller, 53 (33 percent) remained unchanged in size, and 9 (6 percent) became slightly larger. Resection was performed in four patients (2 percent) within four years after radiosurgery. Normal facial function was preserved in 79 percent of the patients after five years (House-Brackmann grade 1), and normal trigeminal function was preserved in 73 percent. Fifty-one percent of the patients had no change in hearing ability. No new neurologic deficits appeared more than 28 months after radiosurgery. An outcomes questionnaire was returned by 115 patients (77 percent of the 149 patients still living). Fifty-four of these patients (47 percent) were employed at the time of radiosurgery, and 37 (69 percent) remained so. Radiosurgery was believed to have been successful by all 30 patients who had undergone surgery previously and by 81 (95 percent) of the 85 who had not. Thirty-six of the 115 patients (31 percent) described at least one complication, which resolved in 56 percent of those cases., CONCLUSIONS: Radiosurgery can provide long-term control of acoustic neuromas while preserving neurologic function.",Included

3582,"Acceptable levels for ingestion of dimethylsilanediol in water on the International Space Station INTRODUCTION: Water is recovered aboard the International Space Station (ISS) from humidity condensate and treated urine. The product water is monitored for total organic carbon (TOC). In 2010 the TOC readings indicated that a new contaminant had entered the potable water and was steadily increasing toward the TOC screening limit of 3 mg x L(-1). In a ground-based laboratory, chemists discovered that dimethylsilanediol (DMSD) was the principal new contaminant. As no standard existed for safe levels of DMSD in water, the Toxicology Office at Johnson Space Center was asked to set such a standard., METHODS: The Toxicology Office used methods developed over the past decade, in collaboration with the National Research Council Committee on Toxicology, for setting Spacecraft Water Exposure Guidelines (SWEGs). These methods require a thorough literature search and development of an acceptable concentration (AC) for each potential toxic effect, keeping in mind that the adverse effects that accompany spaceflight could increase toxicity for certain end points. Benchmark dose modeling was encouraged if sufficient data were available. The most sensitive AC becomes the driver for the SWEG., RESULTS: Hematotoxicity, hepatotoxicity, and possibly neurotoxicity were the most sensitive toxicological endpoints for DMSD., CONCLUSIONS: The SWEG for DMSD for 100 d of ingestion was set at 35 mg x L(-1), which is equivalent to 9 mg x L(-1) as TOC. This is well above the TOC SWEG of 3 mg x L(-1) and the peak DMSD level of processed water observed on orbit, which was 2.2 mg x L(-1) asTOC (8.5 mg x L(-10 of DMSD).",Excluded
1446,"The morphologic effects of radiation administered therapeutically for intracranial gliomas: a postmortem study of 25 cases To investigate the pathologic consequences of therapeutic radiation, this morphologic study evaluated the brains of 25 patients with intracranial gliomas treated both with and without this form of therapy. Although beneficial effects such as the retardation of tumor growth were evident in these studies, among the seventeen patients who received from 5000--6000 rads for malignant gliomas, four developed ""late delayed"" radiation necrosis. The strong predilection of this tissue response for the white matter adjacent to the neoplasm suggests a local sensitivity which may have been engendered or enhanced by cerebral edema. A fifth case disclosed focal demyelination in the mid-brain suggesting ""early delayed"" radiation necrosis, and an additional case had distinctive foci of necrosis within the brain stem. Changes of diffuse cerebral edema were noted in many of the radiated brains. It is concluded that radiation therapy in commonly employed dosages for malignant gliomas carries a risk of injury to surrounding cerebral tissues.",Included
2399,"p53 expression in human rectal tissue after radiotherapy: upregulation in normal mucosa versus functional loss in rectal carcinomas PURPOSE: In vitro, ionizing radiation of epithelial cells leads to upregulation of wild-type p53 and subsequent induction of p21(waf1). The effect of radiotherapy (RT) on the expression of these proteins in patients is unknown. We assessed the influence of RT on the expression of p53 and p21(waf1) in normal mucosa and rectal carcinomas in vivo., METHODS: Tumor and normal tissue samples were derived from rectal cancer patients randomized in a clinical trial in which the value of preoperative RT was evaluated. p53 and p21(waf1) expression was determined in 51 irradiated and 52 nonirradiated patients using immunohistochemistry., RESULTS: In normal mucosa, both p53 and p21(waf1) were strongly upregulated after RT compared with the expression in unirradiated normal tissue (p <0.001). In tumor cells, no significant difference in the expression of p53 or p21(waf1) was found in the irradiated vs. nonirradiated group. In the few rectal tumors with wild-type p53, induction of p53 after RT did not necessarily lead to upregulation of p21(waf1)., CONCLUSION: These findings demonstrate that in normal mucosa, a functional p53-p21(waf1) pathway is present, whereas in tumor cells it is defective in almost all cases because of either p53 mutation or down- or upstream disruption in tumors with wild-type p53. Therefore, we believe that the role of p53 expression as a single prognostic marker in rectal cancer needs reconsideration.",Included
123,"Multivariate logistic regression analysis of the prognostic factors for 840 patients with nasopharyngeal carcinoma Objective: To investigate the prognostic factors for patients with nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) who received radiotherapy (RT) and to provide information about improvement in NPC RT techniques. Method(s): We retrospectively analyzed the data from 840 cases of NPC that received RT from January 1996 to December 2001 in our hospital. The Kaplan-Meier method was used to calculate the control rate of nasopharynx, the tumor-free survival rate and overall survival. Log-rank test was conducted to determine significance. The Cox proportional hazards regression model was used to confirm the significance of prognostic factors. Result(s): 1) The total control rates of nasopharynx for 3, 5 and 10 years were 70.6%, 56.7% and 36.6%, respectively. The tumor-free survival rates for 3, 5, and 10 years were 66.8%, 51.8% and 32.0%, respectively. The overall survival rates for 3, 5, and 10 years were 73.8%, 58.6% and 39.4%, respectively. 2) Univariate logistic regression analysis showed that gender, age, clinical stage, T stage, N stage, skull base invasion, cranial nerve invasion, nasal cavity invasion, cervical node metastasis, unilateral/bilateral neck node metastasis, cervical node metastasis position, intracavity brachytherapy of nasopharynx, external beam radiotherapy method and chemotherapy were significantly associated with the control rate of nasopharynx, tumor-free survival, and overall survival (P<0.05). The irradiation dose of nasopharynx was significantly associated with the nasopharynx control rate and overall survival (P<0.05). The tumor-free survival of the patients with carotid sheath involvement was lower than that of the patients without carotid sheath involvement (P<0.05). 3) Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that gender, age, clinical stage, T stage, unilateral/bilateral cervical node metastasis, and intracavity brachytherapy of nasopharynx were independent influential factors of the control rate of nasopharynx, tumor-free survival and overall survival. 4) The stratified analysis showed that T2 and T3 patients who received adjuvant high dose intracavity brachytherapy of nasopharynx presented with a higher control rate of nasopharynx, tumor-free survival and overall survival (P<0.05). Conclusion(s): Male NPC patients with advanced clinical stage (especially T stage) and bilateral cervical node metastasis have a poorer prognosis.

The GG homozygotes had significantly shorter PFS under codominant and recessive models in all patients (hazard ratio (HR) 1.47, p = 0.035, and HR 1.47, p = 0.022, respectively) and in advanced stage subgroup (HR 1.49, p = 0.037, and HR 1.48, p = 0.023, respectively).

Our results indicate, for the first time, that the SIPA1 -313A>G may have a prognostic role in unresected NSCLC making it a potential predictor of poor survival due to earlier progression.Copyright © 2014, International Society of Oncology and BioMarkers (ISOBM).",Excluded
513,"Options for the modified radiation weighting factor of neutrons The recent ICRP Report 92 has noted that the current radiation weighting factor, wR, depends on the energy of the incident neutrons in a manner that differs substantially from the dependence, which results from the current convention, QL. At all neutron energies, but most conspicuously below 1 MeV, the values of wR exceed those of the effective quality factor, qE. The discrepancy is largely due to the fact that--in the absence of computed values of the effective quality factor for neutrons--wR has been patterned after the values of the ambient quality factor, which accounts insufficiently for the low-linear energy transfer (LET) gamma ray component from neutron capture in the human body. There are different options to remove the discrepancy. Option 1 is to reduce wR substantially at all neutron energies to make it equal to qE for a standard condition, such as isotropic incidence of the neutrons. Since such a reduction may cause problems in those countries where the current wR values are already legally implemented, ICRP 92 has proposed what is here termed Option 2. It recommended to replace QL by the increased value 1.6 QL - 0.6 and, accordingly, to make the radiation weighting factor equal to 1.6 qE - 0.6. With Option 2 the radiation weighting factor needs to be decreased appreciably at low neutron energies, but for fission neutron spectra the overall changes are minor. To guide--regardless which option is chosen--the selection of the numerical values, the effective quality factor, qE, is computed here for different directional distributions of neutrons incident on the anthropomorphic phantoms ADAM and EVA. None of the sex averaged numerical values is found to deviate much from those for isotropic incidence. Isotropic incidence can, thus, be used as an adequate standard condition. A numerical approximation is proposed for the standard qE that is nearly equivalent to a formula invoked by ICRP 92, but is somewhat simpler and provides realistic values of qE even for the extremely high neutron energies in space. In line with ICRP 92, it is emphasised that wR needs to be seen as a derived quantity related to the LET-dependent weighting factor. Copyright 2004 Oxford University Press",Excluded

1719,"[Possibilities of prognostication of individual radiation sensitivity] Proceeding from the concept of individual radiosensitivity as a sign of total reactivity 3 directions in a study of its possible prediction were considered: establishing correlation between separate indices characterizing the initial state and total radiosensitivity; correlation between body reactions to non-radiation exposures and subsequent irradiation; comparison of total radiosensitivity to irradiation at a small dose and subsequent irradiation at LD50. The following indices were used for the evaluation of the basal status of the body: oxygen consumption level, body mass increase rate, the level of water and basal metabolism, peripheral blood indices, body temperature, basal indices of the functional adrenocortical activity, the state of the cardiovascular system. The following non-radiation stress-exposures were used: physical exercise, constant magnetic field, starvation, hypoxia, and adrenaline administration. A V-type dependency was established for most investigated indices of the basal status and reaction of the body to non-radiation exposures. The utmost radioresistance was shown by animals in whom the basal indices or their reaction to non-radiation exposure approximated the average group level. The third direction: comparison of radiosensitivity and radiation damage--was analyzed by comparing the reaction of cerebral biocurrents to radiation exposure at a small dose with subsequent damage of the body following irradiation at a lethal dose.

3708,"Lung cancer in never smokers Lung cancer is predominantly associated with cigarette smoking; however, a substantial minority of patients with the disease have never smoked. In the US it is estimated there are 17,000-26,000 annual deaths from lung cancer innever smokers, which as a separate entity would be the seventh leading cause of cancer mortality. Controversy surrounds the question of whether or not the incidence of lung cancer in never-smokers is increasing, with more data to support this observation in Asia. There are several factors associated with an increased risk of developing lung cancer in never smokers including second hand smoke, indoor air pollution, occupational exposures, and genetic susceptibility among others. Adenocarcinoma is the most common histology of lung cancer in never smokers and in comparison to lung cancer in smokers appears less complex with a higher likelihood to have targetable driver mutations.Copyright © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2016.",Excluded
225,"Changes in X-ray sensitivity of mouse eggs from fertilization to the early pronuclear stage, and their repair capacity To study the changes in radiosensitivity of male and female genomes from fertilization to the pronuclear stage, the frequency of induced chromosome aberrations was examined at the first-cleavage metaphase in eggs fertilized with X-irradiated sperm, in eggs X-irradiated at the mature oocyte stage immediately before fertilization, and in fertilized eggs exposed to X-rays at various stages before DNA synthesis (1-5 h after insemination). Gametic treatment, fertilization and embryo culture were carried out in vitro. Most of the induced chromosome aberrations were chromosome-type aberrations, the frequency of chromosome fragments being the highest, followed by chromosome exchanges in both sperm and oocytes. The induction of chromosome-type aberrations was much higher in oocytes than in sperm. Chromosome-type aberrations were the main type also in fertilized eggs irradiated at the pre-DNA-synthetic stage. The radiosensitivity increased gradually with pronuclear formation (1-4h after insemination), but little difference in radiosensitivity was observed between eggs irradiated at 4 h and 5 h, corresponding to the stage when pronuclear formation was complete. The drastic change with pronuclear formation was found not only in radiosensitivity but also in the frequency of chromosome aberrations. The frequency of chromosome-type exchanges decreased drastically 2 h after insemination, and exchanges were barely observed at 5 h. The difference in radiosensitivity between male and female genomes also markedly changed with pronuclear formation, the chromosome aberration induction in the female genome being much higher than that in the male genome before accomplishment of pronuclear formation. The analysis of potentiation effects of 3-aminobenzamide and caffeine on the yield of X-ray-induced chromosome aberrations demonstrated that the increase of radiosensitivity and the decrease of chromosome-type exchange induction with pronuclear formation, may be closely correlated with alterations in chromatin configuration in the pronuclei and in repair capacity of fertilized eggs at the pre-DNA-synthetic stage. No evidence based on repair efficiency was found for the marked difference in radiosensitivity between male and female genomes during pronuclear formation.",Excluded

Right and left kidney, liver, spleen, bone marrow, tumor and whole body dosimetry were performed. Bone marrow dosimetry was done with the blood samples taken in 3rd, 15th, 30th, 60th, 180th minutes and 24th, 48th and 72nd hours after the infusion. Organ, tumor and whole body dosimetry were calculated with anterior and posterior planar scintigraphic images taken in 4th, 24th, 48th and 72nd hours after the infusion. The necessary organ thickness, body thickness and organ Hounsfield unit values to calculate photon decrease were obtained from CT images. Time-activity curve of all data was drawn and fit in biexponential curves. Regression curves were integrated for all organs, thus cumulative activity for each organ was calculated and organ dose was calculated via MIRD method. Result(s): Total 3.8-24.2 GBq (mean:12.2+/-5.5 GBq) Lu-177 DOTA TATE was given to patients. Twenty-two patients received only one cycle, 19 patients received 2 cycles, 17 patients received 3 cycles, 7 patients received 4 cycles and 2 patients received 5 cycles of treatment. Dosimetry was performed for left kidney, right kidney, bone marrow, tumor and whole body. Doses were calculated separately for each patient in units of Gray (Gy). When all patients were taken into consideration, calculated mean dose value was counted as 10.6+/-5.7, 11.2+/-6.0, 0.4+/-0.2, 176.7+/-126.7 and 0.7+/-0.5 Gy for left kidney, right kidney, bone marrow, tumor and whole body, respectively Conclusion(s): This study demonstrated that absorbed radiation dose in high dose Lu-177 DOTA TATE treatment is in safe range. At the end of all cycles of treatments, dose limits did not exceed safe limits in the all patients.",Excluded
1776,"Hyberbaric oxygen as sole treatment for severe radiation - induced haemorrhagic cystitis PURPOSE: To examine the safety and efficacy of hyperbaric oxygen as the primary and sole treatment for severe radiation-induced haemorrhagic cystitis., MATERIALS AND METHODS: Hyperbaric oxygen was prospectively applied as primary treatment in 38 patients with severe radiation cystitis. Our primary endpoint was the incidence of complete and partial response to treatment, while the secondary endpoints included the duration of response, the correlation of treatment success-rate to the interval between the onset of haematuria and initiation of therapy, blood transfusion need and total radiation dose, the number of sessions to success, the avoidance of surgery and the overall survival., RESULTS: All patients completed therapy without complications with a mean follow-up of 29.33 months. Median number of sessions needed was 33. Complete and partial response rate was 86.8% and 13.2%, respectively. All 33 patients with complete response received therapy within 6 months of the haematuria onset. One patient needed cystectomy, while 33 patients were alive at the end of follow-up., CONCLUSIONS: Our study suggests the early primary use of hyperbaric oxygen for radiation-induced severe cystitis as an effective and safe treatment option.

2343,"Effective time window in reducing pituitary adenoma size by gamma knife radiosurgery Objectives: Although the effectiveness of gamma knife radiosurgery (GKRS) in controlling the size of pituitary adenomas has been well demonstrated in many studies, the time period in which significant changes in tumor size occurs has been investigated in a limited fashion. It is important to determine the therapeutic window of GKRS in treating pituitary adenomas, i.e., the effective timeframe during which significant size reduction of these tumors occurs, so that alternative treatments such as further GKRS or microsurgery might be prescribed in a timely manner if clinically indicated. Method(s): This was a nested sample of an ongoing local cohort study on GKRS for pituitary adenomas at the University of Virginia. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) using dedicated sequences was employed. Only patients with a baseline MRI (TP0) and at least 1 follow-up study performed in the University Hospital after GKRS were included. The follow-up scans were performed at five time-points (TP1-TP5) which were 6, 12, 24, 36 and 48 months after GKRS. The dimensional indices of the tumors were measured in three orthogonal planes, i.e., transverse (TR), antero-posterior (AP) and cranio-caudal (CC). The volumes of the tumors were estimated by using the following formula: $${\text{V}} = \pi\,({\text{TR}} \times {\text{AP}} \times {\text{CC}})/6$$V=pi(TRxAPxCC)/6. Tumor volume decrease by more than 25 % from baseline was considered as 'shrinkage', <25 % tumor size increase or decrease was considered 'static', and more than 25 % increase as 'increment'. Our cohort consisted of 21 patients, with functioning adenomas in 13 subjects i.e. six adrenocorticotrophic hormone (ACTH)-secreting and seven growth hormone (GH)-secreting, and non-functioning (NF) adenomas in eight subjects. Result(s): In 26 adenomas (8 ACTH, 9 GH and 9 NF), tumor control (tumor shrinkage or static) were achieved in 21 tumors (80.8 %); 89, 75, and 78 % for GH-secreting, ACTH-secreting and NF adenomas respectively, at the end of the 4-year follow-up period. Analysis of variance showed significant differences of GKRS margin dose among different types of tumors (p = 0.013), but not of baseline tumor volumes (p = 0.240). Logistic regression analysis showed no significant association of margin dose, baseline volume or tumor type with the tumor control outcome. Comparison of tumor change using dimensional indices relative to the base time point (TP0) showed that in the sample there was an average reduction of 1.290 mm at TP1 (6 months) with p values 0.155 (parametric t test) and 0.098 (non-parametric Wilcoxon signed-ranked test) respectively, showing a moderate reduction in tumor dimensional indices. The change in dimensional indices at later time points (TP2-TP5) showed an average reduction ranging from 1.930 to 2.471 mm. Significant reduction in the mean dimensional indices was firstly observed at TP2 (1 year) with p values 0.013 (t test) and 0.018 (Wilcoxon signed-rank test). Such scale of reduction in the dimensional indices appeared to be maintained along the time axis (from TP2 to TP5). Conclusion(s): Significant decrease in tumor dimensional indices tended to occur at 1 year post-GKRS. Although to a lesser extent, such decrease in dimensional indices continued up to the end of our follow-up period.Copyright © 2014, Springer Science+Business Media New York.",Excluded
1860,"Prognostic value of the micronucleus assay for clinical endpoints in neoadjuvant radiochemotherapy for rectal cancer BACKGROUND: The question whether lymphocyte radiosensitivity is representative of patients' response to radiotherapy (RT) remains unsolved. We analyzed lymphocyte cytogenetic damage in patients who were homogeneously treated with preoperative radiochemotherapy (RCT) for rectal cancer within clinical trials. We tested for interindividual variation and consistent radiosensitivity after in-vivo and in-vitro irradiation, analyzed the effect of patients' and RCT characteristics on cytogenetic damage, and tested for correlations with patients' outcome in terms of tumor response, survival and treatment-related toxicity., METHODS: The cytokinesis-block micronucleus cytome (CBMNcyt) assay was performed on the peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBLCs) of 134 patients obtained before, during, at the end of RCT, and during the 2-year follow-up. A subset of PBLCs obtained before RCT was irradiated in-vitro with 3 Gy. RCT included 50.4 Gy of pelvic RT with 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) alone (n = 78) or 5-FU plus oxaliplatin (n = 56). The analyzed variables included patients' age, gender, RT characteristics (planning target volume size [PTV size], RT technique), and chemotherapy characteristics (5-FU plasma levels, addition of oxaliplatin). Outcome was analyzed as tumor regression, patient survival, and acute and late toxicity., RESULTS: Cytogenetic damage increased significantly with the radiation dose and varied substantially between individuals. Women were more sensitive than men; no significant age-dependent differences were observed. There was a significant correlation between the cytogenetic damage after in-vitro irradiation and in-vivo RCT. We found a significant effect of the PTV size on the yields of cytogenetic damage after RCT, while the RT technique had no effect. Neither the addition of oxaliplatin nor the 5-FU levels influenced cytogenetic damage. We found no correlation between patient outcome and the cytogenetic damage., CONCLUSIONS: We found consistent cytogenetic damage in lymphocytes after in-vivo RCT and in-vitro irradiation. Gender was confirmed as a well-known, and the PTV size was identified as a less well-known influencing variable on lymphocyte cytogenetic damage after partial-body irradiation. A consistent level of cytogenetic damage after in-vivo and in-vitro irradiation may indicate the importance of genetic factors for individual radiosensitivity. However, we found no evidence that in-vivo or in-vitro irradiation-induced cytogenetic damage is an adequate biomarker for the response to RCT in rectal cancer patients.",Excluded

2764,Role of the direct action of radiation in the mechanism of development of mammary gland tumors The role of the direct action of radiation in the genesis of mammary gland tumors in animals of both sexes was studied in experiments on noninbred albino rats. In two series of experiments the anterior or posterior half of the rat's body was irradiated with X rays in doses of 200 to 1000 rad. Tumors of the mammary glands appeared considerably earlier and were more numerous in the irradiated parts of the body of both females and males than in the unirradiated glands or in control animals. Females developed mammary gland tumors after exposure to smaller doses and in a higher proportion of cases than males.,Included
2826,"Irradiation of adult human dental pulp stem cells provokes activation of p53, cell cycle arrest, and senescence but not apoptosis Adult human dental pulp contains stem cells (DPSCs) that are capable of differentiation into osteoblasts, odontoblasts, adipocytes, and neuronal-like cells. Because these cells have potential use in tissue regeneration, herein we characterized the response of DPSC lines to ionizing radiation (IR). These DPSC lines have been developed from the extracted molars of healthy donors. DPSCs were cultivated in a unique media supplemented with epidermal growth factor (EGF) and platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF). Since tissue homeostasis depends on a precise balance among cell proliferation, senescence, and cell death, we explored the effects of IR (2-20 Gy) on the proliferative activity of DPSCs and the molecular pathways involved. Even the highest dose used (20 Gy) did not induce DPSC apoptosis. After irradiation with doses of 6 and 20 Gy, DPSCs accumulated in the G2 phase of the cell cycle. DPSCs responded to IR (20 Gy) with senescence detected as SA-beta-galactosidase positivity, beginning on the third day after irradiation. Twenty-four hours after irradiation, p53 and its serine 15 and 392 phosphorylated forms were detected. At this time, p21 (WAF1) was induced. Increases in protein p16 were observed from the third day following irradiation and continued till the end of the examination (Day 13). We conclude that DPSCs respond to IR-induced damage by permanent cell cycle arrest in the G2 phase and by stress-induced premature senescence. © 2010, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.",Included

Method(s): A total of 72 patients with locally advanced esophageal squamous cell carcinoma, which were admitted to our hospital from October 2011 to December 2013, were retrospectively analyzed in this study. Result(s): Thirty-six patients (50%) were treated with IMRT alone, while the other 36 patients (50%) were treated by IMRT combined with chemotherapy containing liposomal paclitaxel and cisplatin. Patients treated with chemoradiotherapy showed significantly superior overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) compared to patients treated with IMRT alone (median OS: respectively, 29.7 vs. 12.9 months, P=0.0287; median PFS: respectively, 14.0 vs. 6.5 months, P=0.0186). Multivariate Cox analysis confirmed the inclusion of chemotherapy as an independent predictor of favorable OS and PFS. Both chemoradiotherapy and IMRT were well-tolerated in our cohort. Conclusion(s): Chemotherapy improved the prognosis of locally advanced esophageal squamous cell carcinoma treated with IMRT. Large prospective studies are needed to confirm the therapeutic value of IMRT combined with chemotherapy in locally advanced esophageal squamous cell carcinoma.Copyright © Annals of Translational Medicine.

2562,"Radiation exposure from computed tomography in blunt trauma patients Methods. Using data from our hospital information system, we selected patients assigned a trauma code, according to the Korean Standard Classification of Diseases, and with three or more body lesions assessed by CT at the same time in the emergency department. Each CT conducted was categorized into 'CT related to the final diagnosis' or 'CT unrelated to final diagnosis'. The characteristics and estimated effective dose of CTs unrelated to the final diagnosis were analyzed. The factors affecting the estimated effective dose of CTs unrelated to final diagnosis were investigated., Results. More than half of all CT examinations were not associated with the final diagnosis. The additional estimated effective dose due to CTs being unrelated to the final diagnosis in each patient was a sufficient amount of radiation exposure to increase the possibility of fatal cancer., Introduction. Computed tomography (CT) has many diagnostic advantages, spurring growth in the number of CT examinations. As the use of CT increases, the potential for radiation-induced adverse effects has become an issue. The primary objective of this study was to assess the liberal use of CT induced radiation exposure in patients with multiple blunt traumas. The secondary objective was to investigate the factors affecting the estimated effective dose resulting from CTs unrelated to final diagnosis., Conclusion. A considerable number of CT scans were unrelated to the patient's final diagnosis, which exposes the patient to additional radiation exposure.Copyright ©, Pharmamed Mado Ltd.

1614,"Improvement in automated quantitation of myocardial perfusion abnormality by using iterative reconstruction image in combination with resolution recovery, attenuation and scatter corrections for the detection of coronary artery disease OBJECTIVE: An iterative reconstruction method in combination with resolution recovery, attenuation and scatter corrections (IR-RASC) can improve image quality. It, however, is undetermined whether this technique can improve the detection of coronary artery disease (CAD) when automated quantitative analysis is used. This study evaluated diagnostic values of IR-RASC in combination with automated quantitative analysis in stress myocardial perfusion imaging (MPI) in the CAD detection., METHODS: This study enrolled consecutive 64 patients (mean age 66.2 +/- 17.3 years, 39 males) who had undergone both 99mTc-labeled tetrofosmin stress MPI and coronary angiography within 3 months. Stress MPI abnormalities quantified as summed stress score (SSS), summed rest score (SRS) and summed difference score (SDS) by Heart Risk View-S (HRV-S) and Quantitative Perfusion SPECT (QPS) softwares using IR-RASC images were compared with those by using conventional filtered back-projection method (FBP) images and angiographic findings., RESULTS: Based on expert visual assessment, SSS and SRS by HRV-S/QPS softwares with IR-RASC were significantly lower than those by HRV-S/QPS softwares with FBP at mid- and basal left ventricular segments. Receiver-operating characteristics analysis showed that areas under the curve assessed by HRV-S (0.687) and QPS (0.678) with IR-RASC were nearly identical to those (0.717-0.724) by expert assessment with FBP, and were significantly (P < 0.05) greater than those by HRV-S (0.505) and QPS (0.522) with FBP. When HRV-S was used, the specificity and diagnostic accuracy of IR-RASC in the CAD detection were significantly greater than those of FBP: 90.3 versus 51.6%, P < 0.0001 and 79.7 versus 54.7%, P = 0.0027, respectively. Likewise, when QPS was used, the specificity and diagnostic accuracy of IR-RASC in the CAD detection were significantly greater than those of FBP: 80.6 versus 41.9%, P < 0.0001, and 78.1 versus 51.6%, P = 0.0018, respectively. There, however, were no significant differences in sensitivity between IR-RASC and FBP images., CONCLUSIONS: IR-RASC can improve diagnostic accuracy of the CAD detection using an automated scoring system compared to FBP, by reducing false positivity due to artefactual appearance.",Excluded
2568,"Pilot study trialling a new ambulatory method for the clinical assessment of regional gastrointestinal transit using multiple electromagnetic capsules BACKGROUND: Gastrointestinal (GI) motor disorders often involve several regions of the GI tract. Therefore, easy and safe assessment of whole gut and regional motility is valuable for more precise diagnosis. 3D-Transit is a novel method for ambulatory evaluation of total and regional gastrointestinal transit times (GITT) based on the anatomical localization of ingestible electromagnetic capsules. The main purpose of this study was to test the performance of the 3D-Transit system., METHODS: Twenty healthy volunteers each ingested three electromagnetic capsules over a period of two consecutive days. Standard radio-opaque markers (ROM) were also ingested to assess the agreement between total GITT obtained with both methods., KEY RESULTS: Investigations were well-tolerated and three capsules could be tracked simultaneously with minimal data loss (Capsule 1: median: 0.2% of time (range 0-25.3%). Region specific contraction patterns were identified and used for computation of total and regional GITT in all subjects. Inter-observer agreement was 100% for total GITT (median variation 0%) but less for regional GITT. Day-to-day and diurnal variations were significant for total and regional GITT. Total GITT assessed by 3D-Transit capsules were moderately well-correlated to those assessed with standard ROM (Spearman's rho = 0.7)., CONCLUSIONS & INFERENCES: 3D-transit is a well-tolerated and minimal invasive ambulatory method for assessment of GI motility. By providing both total and regional transit times, the 3D-Transit system holds great promise for future clinical studies of GI function in health and disease.

We evaluate the efficacy and safety of CyberKnife treatment in the management of metastatic cancer to the pituitary grand. PATIENTS 13 pituitary metastases (male 6, female 7). Age 47y-69y (median 53y). KPS 70. No previous irradiation. METHOD(S): Treatment system: CyberKnife (G3 or G4), Planning system: On target, Multiplan (Accuray), Calculation model: Ray tracing, Inverse algorithm, Immobilaization: thermoplastic mask, Image: CECT 1mm in thickness + MRI Gd T1WI 1-3mm in thickness, PTV = CTV = GTV, Verification: TLS (Target locating system), 6 axis correction. TREATMENT PROTOCOL: Marginal dose: D95PTV 95%, iso-dose line 80% (goal), Fractions: tumor size, adjacent to OAR (organs at risk), Tolerable dose of optic appratus: 12Gy (SRS), 21Gy (3fr.), 25Gy (5fr.), 28Gy (7fr.). Tumor volume (PTV): 0.5-18.2 cc (median 2.8 cc), Primary origin: Breast 5, Lung 2, Others 6. Clinical symptom: visual disturbance 11 (85%), diabetes insipidus 5 (38%), diplopia 1 (7.7%), asymptomatic 1 (7.7%). Marginal dose: 18-35 Gy (median 23Gy). RESULT(S): Follow up periods 4-31months. Progression free survival: 81.8% (@6m), 63.6% (@12m), 54.5% (@24m). Overall survival: 92.3% (@3m), 84.6% (@6m), 67.3% (@12m), 25.6% (@24m).

294,"Radiation-induced apoptosis varies among individuals and is modified by sex and age Purpose: Although there are considerable data on mechanisms of radiation-induced apoptosis in vitro and in animal models, little is known about functional variation in these pathways in humans. We sought to develop a tractable system to evaluate this. Material(s) and Method(s): Peripheral blood mononuclear cells were isolated from 90 healthy volunteers, divided into two aliquots, one irradiated with a 5 Gy dose and the other sham-treated (0 Gy), and assessed for damage-induced apoptosis after 24 hours. To investigate reproducibility, 10 individuals spanning the entire radiation-induced apoptotic range were tested three times each, with 3-6 months between replicates. Result(s): We observed surprising heterogeneity in apoptosis among individuals, ranging from 21-62%. Biological replicates from a single individual, however, were completely concordant, suggesting the variability observed across individuals is not the result of stochastic or short-term effects. We found significantly higher radiation-induced apoptosis in males than in females (Mean: 41.0% vs. 30.7%; p < 3.5 x 10<sup>-7</sup>). Moreover, advancing age was associated with decreasing radiation-induced apoptosis in males (p = 0.01) but not females (p = 0.82). Conclusion(s): Our results provide evidence that the function of cellular pathways crucial for stress-induced apoptosis varies by sex and could decline with age in humans.

In 12 rats, 3D AR visualization of preprocedural MR images was performed before embolization. Procedural metrics including catheterization time and radiation exposure were compared vs a prospective cohort of 16 rats in which embolization was performed without AR. An additional cohort of 15 retrospective cases was identified and combined with the prospective control cohort (n = 31) to improve statistical power., RESULTS: A 37% reduction in fluoroscopy time, from 11.7 min to 7.4 minutes, was observed with AR when compared prospectively, which did not reach statistical significance (P = .12); however, when compared with combined prospective and retrospective controls, the reduction in fluoroscopy time from 14.1 min to 7.4 minutes (48%) was significant (P = .01). A 27% reduction in total catheterization time, from 42.7 minutes to 31.0 minutes, was also observed with AR when compared prospectively, which did not reach statistical significance (P = .11). No significant differences were seen in dose-area product or air kerma prospectively., CONCLUSIONS: Three-dimensional AR visualization of preprocedural imaging may aid in the reduction of procedural metrics in a preclinical model of transarterial embolization.

945,"Increased oxidative stress in barn swallows from the Chernobyl region The Chernobyl nuclear accident produced the largest unintended release of radionuclides in history, with dramatic consequences for humans and other organisms. Exposure to ionizing radiation is known to reduce circulating and stored levels of specific antioxidants in birds and humans, thus potentially increasing oxidative stress. However, overall effects of radioactive exposure on oxidative status have never been investigated in any free ranging vertebrate. We measured plasma antioxidant capacity and concentration of reactive oxygen metabolites in adult barn swallows (Hirundo rustica) from colonies with variable background radiation levels in the Chernobyl region in Ukraine and Belarus. We predicted that antioxidants would decrease while reactive oxygen metabolites would increase with exposure to increasing levels of radiation at the breeding sites. Consistent with this expectation, radiation level positively predicted plasma concentration of reactive oxygen metabolites, whereas no significant covariation was found with non-enzymatic plasma antioxidant capacity. An index of oxidative stress was also larger in barn swallows exposed to high contamination levels. Thus, radioactive contamination appeared to be responsible for the increased generation of reactive oxygen metabolites and the imbalance between reactive oxygen metabolites and non-enzymatic plasma antioxidant capacity.",Included

We aimed to access the impact of CT protocol optimization and technological evolution on the contrast and radiation dose as well as on image quality previous to atrial fibrillation (AF) ablation., METHODS: From a prospective registry of consecutive patients who underwent cardiac CT in a single center, we selected 270 patients in whom the CT was done for evaluation prior to AF ablation and they were distributed in 3 groups: Group1: the first 150 patients included; Group2: the last 60 patients performed with the same CT scanner; Group3: the first 60 exams performed with the new CT scanner. Quality of the protocol was access based on radiation dose, contrast volume used, the use of a second (delayed) acquisition, and on quantitative image quality analisis (signal to noise and contrast to noise ratios; density homogeneity racio between LA and LAA)., RESULTS: We found a significant radiation dose as well as contrast dose reduction between the first and last subgroups (G1: 5,6mSv and 100ml; G2: 1,3mSv and 90ml; G3: 0,6mSv and 65ml). Even though group 3 had less radiation and contrast used it still had better quantitative image quality (signal/noise of 13,5; contrast/noise 14,8; density homogeneity racio of 0,92)., CONCLUSION: Protocol optimization and technology both contributed to significant lower radiation dose and contrast volume used on cardiac CTs prior to AF ablation, without compromising image quality.

2424,"Elevated Radiation Exposure Associated With Above Surface Flat Detector Mini C-Arm Use Background: This study aims to test the hypothesis that: (1) radiation exposure is increased with the intended use of Flat Surface Image Intensifier (FSII) units above the operative surface compared with the traditional below-table configuration; (2) this differential increases in a dose-dependent manner; and (3) radiation exposure varies with body part and proximity to the radiation source. Methods: A surgeon mannequin was seated at a radiolucent hand table, positioned for volar distal radius plating. Thermoluminescent dosimeters measured exposure to the eyes, thyroid, chest, hand, and groin, for 1- and 15-minute trials from a mini C-arm FSII unit positioned above and below the operating surface. Background radiation was measured by control dosimeters placed within the operating theater. Results: At 1-minute of exposure, hand and eye dosages were significantly greater with the flat detector positioned above the table. At 15-minutes of exposure, hand radiation dosage exceeded that of all other anatomic sites with the FSII in both positions. Hand exposure was increased in a dose-dependent manner with the flat detector in either position, whereas groin exposure saw a dose-dependent only with the flat detector beneath the operating table. Conclusions: These findings suggest that the surgeon's hands and eyes may incur greater radiation exposure compared with other body parts, during routine mini C-arm FSII utilization in its intended position above the operating table. The clinical impact of these findings remains unclear, and future long-term radiation safety investigation is warranted. Surgeons should take precautions to protect critical body parts, particularly when using FSII technology above the operating with prolonged exposure time.",Excluded

Thus, we aimed to evaluate the intraoperative parameters, effectiveness and complications of patients undergoing PCNL between the endoscopic-guided prone split-leg PCNL (ePSL) and the supine PCNL by stratifying patients according to Guy's stone score (GSS)., MATERIALS AND METHODS: A retrospective chart review was conducted of patients undergoing PCNL at two high-volume tertiary referral centers. At one center, patients underwent PCNL using the ePSL technique, while at the second center, patients underwent PCNL in supine. Patient demographics and stone characteristics, operative details, complications and effectiveness were compared between groups. The impact of obesity was also investigated., RESULTS: Of 830 subjects, a total of 449 (54%) underwent PCNL in ePSL and 381 (46%) in supine. The ePSL group had a greater mean age and body mass index. No statistical differences were found in gender, serum chemistry and Charlson comorbidity index. After stratifying patients by GSS, the differences in baseline stone burden between PSL and supine lost significance and both groups could be compared. Complications were not statistically different between both groups. Univariate analysis demonstrated that multiple tracts and lower pole access were more prevalent in supine. In addition, for GSS1-3, ePSL was correlated with reduced operative time, radiation exposure, length of hospital stay and need for secondary procedure. Multivariate analysis correlated ePSL with lower radiation exposure and need for secondary procedures (p = 0.01). In comparison to the whole trial population, the same tendencies were appreciated for obese cohort., CONCLUSIONS: This is the first report focusing on the performance differences between ePSL and supine PCNL stratified by GSS. Both techniques are safe, with a low rate of complications. For GSS1-3, ePSL reduces radiation exposure and requires less need for both multiple access and secondary procedure.",Excluded

Methods. 114 patients underwent coronary CTA study using 320-row MDCT scanner. 87 patients with mean age (61 + 13 years), mean BMI (29 + 6), and mean heart rate (HR) (58 + 7 bpm) were imaged at predefined 66-80% R-R interval and then reconstructed at 75% while 27 patients with mean age (63 + 16 years), mean BMI (28 + 5), and mean HR (57 + 7 bpm) were scanned throughout the complete R-R interval with tube current modulation. The effective dose (ED) was calculated from dose length product (DLP) and conversion k (0.014 mSv/mGy/cm). Image quality was assessed using a three-point ordinal scale (1 = excellent, 2 = good, and 3 = nondiagnostic). Results. Both groups were statistically similar to each other with reference of HR (P=0.59), BMI (P=0.17), and tube current mAs (P=0.68). The median radiation dose was significantly higher in those scanned with complete R-R phase window versus narrow phase window (P<0.0001). Independently of patient and scan parameters, increased phase window was associated with higher radiation dose (P<0.001). Image quality was better among those scanned with narrow phase window versus complete phase window (P<0.0001). Conclusion. Our study supports that good HR control and predefined narrow window acquisition result in lower radiation dose without compromising diagnostic image quality for coronary disease evaluation. © 2013 Faisal Khosa et al.",Excluded
1887,"Loss of osseous homeostasis is present in radiographically normal knees with documented medial meniscus tears Background: Medial compartment arthrosis associated with loss of osseous homeostasis (positive technetium bone scan) is a well recognized long term sequelae in patients with documented medial meniscus tears. The temporal occurrence of this loss of osseous homeostasis has not to the present been shown. Purpose(s): To report the preoperative scintigraphic imaging findings in 79 patients with MRI documented medial meniscus tears and normal radiographs. Material(s) and Method(s): 79 adults (66 males and 13 females) without a history of prior injury or surgery between the ages of 27 and 61 (mean age 41) were included in the study. All patients had a normal preoperative Rosenberg x-ray (weight bearing PA radiograph) an MRI diagnostic of a structurally damaged medial meniscus, and a standard three-hour delayed technetium 99m-MDP bone scan of the knees. Result(s): 77/79 (97%) of the technetium bone scans were positive (increased scintigraphic activity) manifesting loss of osseous homeostasis in the medial compartment of the knees with documented torn medial meniscus findings of in the face of normal structural bone imaging . All patients had surgical documentation of the medial meniscus tears. Discussion(s): Loss of osseous homeostasis of the medial compartment of knees with documented medial meniscus tears was present at a time when the radiographic findings were normal. The conceptualization of the extent of the pathology in such patients needs to include loss of osseous homeostasis. Future studies documenting the post-operative history of surgically treated patients with medial meniscus tears may yield information of interest regarding the development of osteoarthritis (OA) of the knee. It is postulated that the persistent post-operative loss of osseous homeostasis may identify those knees as ones at risk of the early development of OA, whereas the restoration of osseous homeostasis may be an important marker that such knees are not at risk for the development of OA.",Excluded
681,"[Predicting the recurrence of thyrotoxicosis after iodine radioisotope therapy of diffuse toxic goiter] Prediction of a recurrence of thyrotoxicosis during radioiodine therapy of patients with diffuse toxic goiter (DTG) is a pressing problem of everyday treatment of such patients. Altogether 43 DTG patients were investigated during 12-18 mos. after 131I therapy with the determination of T4, T3, bTSH, delta TSH in the TRH test, peripheral blood rosette forming (RFC), migration index (MI) in the leucocyte migration inhibition reaction, and serum immunoglobulins (IgA, M, G). Changes in the immunological status in parallel with confirmation of autonomous thyroid functioning suggested higher risk of a thyrotoxicosis recurrence making it possible to differentiate the type of observation of a DTG patient following radioiodine therapy. The availability of the above tests allows their use for the prediction of recurrences in everyday clinical practice during therapy of DTG patients with 131I.",Excluded
255,"Osteopathia striata with cranial sclerosis-a rare osteosclerotic bone disorder We present a case of osteopathia striata with cranial sclerosis (OS-CS) in an 18 year old female who presented to our clinic for evaluation of cranial sclerosis (CS). The diagnosis of CS followed work-up for sensorineural hearing loss, which revealed bilateral internal auditory canal stenosis. On presentation, she complained of daily frontal headaches, weekly migraines and right knee pain. Medical history was remarkable for a cleft palate, delayed dental eruptions, hearing loss necessitating hearing aids and irregular menses. She had not sustained any fractures. Family history was negative for bone disorders, neurological disorders or endocrinopathies. Examination revealed a well-nourished female below the mid-parental height who was normocephalic with evidence of a prominent jaw, blue sclera and hypertelorism. Musculoskeletal exam was remarkable for scoliosis and shortened 4th and 5th metacarpals. Neurologic exam was remarkable for myopia and deafness. She had a normal intellect. Work-up revealed normal bone specific alk phos, TRAP, calcium, phosphate, PTH and IGF-1 levels. 24 hr urine calcium studies were normal. Vitamin D level was 21ng/ml. Head CT imaging revealed diffuse osteosclerosis of the calvarium and the skull base with osseous encroachment of the bilateral middle ear cavities. There was hypo-pneumatization of the mastoid, maxillary and sphenoid sinuses. DXA scan showed Z scores of: 4.1 at lumbar spine, 2.0 at left total hip, 4.7 at left femoral neck and -1.5 at 1/3 radius. Thoracic spine X-ray showed mild scoliosis. Radiographs of the femurs revealed vertically orientated sclerotic striations extending from the metaphysis to the diaphysis. Radiographs of the pelvis revealed radiating striations extending into the iliac crests. OS-CS, also known as Horan-Beighton syndrome, is a rare X-linked dominant sclerosing bone dysplasia, characterized by dense linear striations of long bones & pelvis, CS and extra-skeletal anomalies such as congenital heart disease, respiratory & renal tract abnormalities. It is caused by a mutation in the WTX (Wilm Tumor on X chromosome) gene and is often lethal in males (1). Patients may remain asymptomatic or present with complications secondary to CS, namely cranial nerve entrapment. It is important to make a diagnosis of OS-CS to enable appropriate genetic testing and enable further testing for extra-skeletal anomalies.",Excluded
150,"Estimation of activity of administered 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose by measurement of the dose equivalent rate on the right temporal region of the head Background: Positron emission tomography (PET) with 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) is now a routine procedure for the management of cancer patients. Intravenous administration of FDG is sometimes halted due to troubles. In such cases, estimations of the FDG dosage injected prior to halting administration may be helpful. We have established a method of estimating the activity of FDG to patients on the basis of the dose equivalent rate on the surface of the right temporal region of the head. The correlation of actual administered dosage with independent variables, such as the dose equivalent rate on the right temporal region of the head, age, sex, and body weight, was analyzed using multiple regression analysis to obtain linear, quadratic, and cubic regression equations. Result(s): When entering independent variables, the cubic regression equation could be used to estimate an administered dosage with an accuracy of +/-10 % for 62 % of all patients and +/-20 % for 90 % of all patients. Conclusion(s): We conclude that this method is useful for estimating the administered dosage from the dose equivalent rate on the temporal region of the head.Copyright © 2016, The Author(s).",Excluded
2162,"The effects of radiation and dose-fractionation on cancer and non-tumor disease development The Janus series of radiation experiments, conducted from 1970 to 1992, explored the effects of gamma and neutron radiation on animal lifespan and disease development. Data from these experiments presents an opportunity to conduct a large scale analysis of both tumor and non-tumor disease development. This work was focused on a subset of animals from the Janus series of experiments, comparing acute or fractionated exposures of gamma or neutron radiation on the hazards associated with the development of tumor and non-tumor diseases of the liver, lung, kidney or vascular system. This study also examines how the co-occurrence of non-tumor diseases may affect tumor-associated hazards. While exposure to radiation increases the hazard of dying with tumor and non-tumor diseases, dose fractionation modulates these hazards, which varies across different organ systems. Finally, the effect that concurrent non-cancer diseases have on the hazard of dying with a tumor also differs by organ system. These results highlight the complexity in the effects of radiation on the liver, lung, kidney and vascular system.",Included
3348,"Pulmonary vein isolation for paroxysmal atrial fibrillation using high-power short duration radiofrequency or second-generation cryoballoon ablation Background: Differences in the left atrial (LA) tissue loss can occur following different pulmonary vein isolation (PVI) techniques. Purpose(s): Our prospective study compared the biomarker, the LA mechanical, and the electrophysiological findings as indicators of LA myocardial damage after a high-power short duration (HPSD) with contact force radiofrequency catheter and second-generation cryoballoon (CB2) ablation of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation (AF). Methods :We enrolled 40 patients with paroxysmal AF [16 (40%) women, mean age = 55.9 +/- 12.4 years] who underwent HPSD (n = 21) or CB2 (n = 19). Biomarker levels (hs-cTnT, CK-MB, hs-CRP, LDH) and the transport function of the LA by transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) were compared pre and post procedurally. High-density mapping (HDM) was performed in sinus rhythm using a multielectrode diagnostic catheter in each group to define isolated left atrial low voltage area (LVA; <0.2mV in bipolar voltage mapping). LA CT-angiography and HDM merge was used to calculate the post-PVI LVA and the LVA/LA surface ratio. Result(s): Postablation hs-cTnT and hs-CRP levels were comparable in the ablation groups (HPSD: 1249 +/- 469 and 9.53 +/- 10.30 vs. CB2: 995 +/- 280 and 12.36 +/- 5.76, p = 0.065 and p = 0.732), while CK-MB and LDH levels were significantly higher following CB2 ablation (HPSD: 6.61 +/- 2.62 and 349.9 +/- 65.6 vs. CB2: 26.01 +/- 6.88 and 451.6 +/- 91.3, p < 0.001 and p < 0.001). The transport function of the LA did not change significantly by TTE after the procedure. Fractional Area Change at baseline and 3 months was 33.9 +/- 13.8 and 33.5 +/- 10.7 p = 0.9 in the HPSD group while 38.1 +/- 8.6 and 35.3 +/- 12.2 p = 0.9 in the CB2 group. LA Ejection Fraction measured in the two groups (before and 3-month post-procedure): HPSD: 51.2 +/- 20.5% and 49.5 +/- 14.7%, p = 0.9, CB2: 49.7 +/- 15.5% and 50.7 +/- 13.3%, p = 0.8). Ablation time was comparable in the two groups (HPSD: 1676 +/- 570 sec, CB2: 1495 +/- 494 sec, p = 0.279), while fluoroscopy time and radiation exposure were significantly higher in the CB2 group (HPSD: 5.62 +/- 4.31 min and 232 +/- 406 cGycm2, CB2: 13.65 +/- 5.18 min and 1819 +/- 1669 cGycm2, p <0.001 and p <0.001). The LVA/LA surface ratio were: HPSD group: 8.37 +/- 6.42% and CB2 group: 13.58 +/- 8.92% (p = 0.007). At 12-month follow-up, the success rate, defined as freedom from AF/atrial tachycardia without antiarrhythmic drug was 80.1% (HPSD) and 84.2% (CB2) respectively. Conclusion(s): The LA scar tissue was significantly higher following CB2 ablation, but did not affect medium-term efficacy. However, tissue loss did not reduce the transport function of the LA.",Excluded
1164,"A Novel Targeted Foraminoplasty Device Improves the Efficacy and Safety of Foraminoplasty in Percutaneous Endoscopic Lumbar Discectomy: Preliminary Clinical Application of 70 Cases Objective: Percutaneous endoscopic lumbar discectomy (PELD) has become a mature and mainstream surgical technique for treating lumbar disc herniation (LDH); however, there is a steep learning curve with PELD, especially for puncture and foraminoplasty. In this study, we assessed the outcome and safety of a novel quantificational and targeted foraminoplasty device named ZESSYS for LDH. Method(s): From September to December of 2016, 70 patients with symptomatic LDH were enrolled in the study. The patients were assigned randomly to either the ZESSYS group or the conventional TESSYS group. We recorded the cannula introduction time, decompression time, radiation exposure time, intraoperative pain feeling score, visual analog scale, Oswestry Disability Index, and Macnab criteria score of the 2 groups. The mean follow-up period was 14 months. Result(s): The average cannula introduction time (16.50 +/- 3.29 minutes) and the radiation exposure time (40.71 +/- 6.23 seconds) in the ZESSYS group were significantly reduced compared with the TESSYS group (cannula introduction time, 20.06 +/- 3.37 minutes, P = 0.000; radiation exposure time, 49.20 +/- 7.84 seconds, P = 0.000). Intraoperative pain feeling score in the ZESSYS group was significantly improved compared with the TESSYS group (P = 0.021). There were no significant differences between the 2 groups for decompression time (P = 0.617), Macnab criteria (P = 0.769), or visual analog scale and Oswestry Disability Index scores at the same time point (P > 0.05). No serious complication was observed in any patients in either group. Conclusion(s): The novel targeted foraminoplasty technique with the specially designed double-cannulas is an effective and safe treatment for lumbar intervertebral disc herniation. It reduces the difficulty of PELD learning, minimizes radiation exposure, and decreases intraoperative pain associated with foraminoplasty.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.",Excluded

During recent years, microwave exposure from the use of cellular telephones has been discussed as a potential risk factor., OBJECTIVE: To determine risk factors for brain tumors., DESIGN: A case-control study, with exposure assessed by questionnaires., PARTICIPANTS: A total of 233 currently living men and women, aged 20 to 80 years, were included. The case patients had histopathologically verified brain tumors and lived in the Uppsala-Orebro region (1994-1996) or the Stockholm region (1995-1996). Two matched controls to each case were selected from the Swedish Population Register., MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Ionizing radiation and use of cellular telephones as risk factors for brain tumors., RESULTS: A total of 209 cases (90%) and 425 controls (91%) answered the questionnaire. Work as a physician yielded an odds ratio (OR) of 6.00, with a 95% confidence interval (CI) of 0.62 to 57.7. All three case patients had worked with fluoroscopy. Radiotherapy of the head and neck region yielded an OR of 3.61 (95% CI, 0.65-19.9). Medical diagnostic x-ray examination of the same area yielded an OR of 2.10 (95% CI, 1.25-3.53), with a tumor induction period of 5 years or more. Chemical industry work yielded an OR of 4.10 (95% CI, 1.25-13.4), and laboratory work yielded an OR of 3.21 (95% CI, 1.16-8.85). Ipsilateral use of cellular telephones increased the risk for tumors in the temporal, temporoparietal, and occipital lobes (OR, 2.42; 95% CI, 0.97-6.05), ie, the anatomic areas with highest exposure to microwaves from a mobile telephone. The result was further strengthened (OR, 2.62; 95% CI, 1.02-6.71) in a multivariate analysis that included laboratory work and medical diagnostic x-ray investigations of the head and neck., CONCLUSION: Exposure to ionizing radiation, work in laboratories, and work in the chemical industry increased the risk of brain tumors.

531,"Extramedullary plasmacytoma: Clinical and histopathologic study Purpose: To review the histories of extramedullary plasmacytoma patients diagnosed in Slovenia between 1969 and 1999, to determine the relationship between radiotherapy (XRT) dose and local tumor control, and to clarify the role of elective nodal XRT and the prognostic value of Bartl's histologic grading criteria (originally devised for multiple myeloma [MM]). Methods and Materials: The database of the Cancer Registry of Slovenia was used for the identification of patients. The inclusion criteria were as follows: bone marrow biopsy showing less than 10% plasma cells, normal skeletal survey, and immunohistochemically determined tumor monoclonality. Simulation/portal films were reviewed to assess the extent of elective nodal XRT. Result(s): Twenty-six patients with 31 tumors fulfilled the inclusion criteria. In 4 patients, nine metachronously appearing solitary tumors were diagnosed. The head-and-neck region and other body sites were the sites of origin of primary tumors in 84% and 16% of patients, respectively, whereas in the two regions, regional disease was seen in 15% and 60% of patients, respectively. Therapy was as follows: XRT, 12 patients; surgery and postoperative XRT, 15 patients; and surgery, 4 patients. Ultimate local and regional control rates were 90% and 97%, respectively, and MM developed in 2 (8%) patients. The 10-year disease-specific and overall survival rates were 87% and 61%, respectively. The analysis of the dose-effect relationship showed that more conservative treatment is justified: for macroscopic disease, 40-50 Gy (2 Gy/day), adjusted to the bulk of disease; for microscopic disease, 36-40 Gy; after R0 surgery, no XRT is required, but close observation is needed. No attempts should be made to treat uninvolved nodal regions. Using Bartl's histologic grading criteria, trends were detected in patients with higher tumor grades: regional lymph node involvement (p = 0.04) and shorter disease-specific survival (p = 0.08). Conclusion(s): Extramedullary plasmacytoma is a highly curable disease when XRT is used with or without previous surgery. The rate of conversion to MM is low. Moderate-dose XRT using limited fields is recommended. The prognostic value of Bartl's grading system needs further evaluation. © 2002 Elsevier Science Inc.",Excluded

INTRODUCTION: For the induction therapy of non-small-cell lung cancer, we need to look for a regimen which produces a reliable high response rate with a low treatment related morbidity and mortality., METHODS: Patients in clinical stages IB, IIA and B, IIIA and B received a course of therapy with 20Gy of radiation in 2 weeks. This was followed by two courses of chemotherapy consisting of paclitaxel 180mg/m(2), cisplatin 45mg/m(2), and ifosfamide 1000mg/m(2). Two to 3 weeks after chemotherapy, the patients were re-evaluated and, if suitable, underwent surgical therapy., RESULTS: A total of 35 patients were entered into the study. The overall response rate was 82.86% (95% confidence interval, 66.35-94.5%). Complete response (CR) was 20% (95% confidence interval, 8.44-36.94%). Twenty-five patients had surgical resection. Subsequently 18 patients received completion radiotherapy of additional 45Gy. The median follow up is 30 months. In 12 patients with stages IB, IIA and B, the median survival was 61 months, and 5-year survival was 55%. In 23 patients with stages IIIA and B, the median survival was 26 months, and 5-year survival was 9.5%. There was 1 patient with Grade 4 and 13 patients with Grade 3 leukopenia, and half of them received granulocyte colony stimulating factor. By the completion radiotherapy, 6 out of 18 patients had less than Grade 2 esophagitis. Five patients had Grade 2 radiation pneumonitis and one Grade 5 (one mortality). There was no postoperative death. The survival results were comparable to those reported recently by others, however the regimen produced a high response rate with low treatment related morbidity/mortality., CONCLUSION: It is a suitable regimen for induction therapy to include earlier stage resectable non-small-cell lung cancers.",Excluded
2115,"Has the outlook improved for amifostine as a clinical radioprotector? UNLABELLED: Amifostine has recently been approved for clinical radiotherapy as a protector against irradiation-induced xerostomia. It is our aim to review the outlook for using amifostine as a general clinical radioprotector. Protection against X-rays is mainly obtained by the scavenging of free radicals. The degree of protection is therefore highly dependent on oxygen tension, with protection factors ranging from 1 to 3. Maximal protection is observed at physiological levels of oxygenation. A great variability in protection has also been observed between different normal tissues. Some tissue, like brain, is not protected while salivary glands and bone marrow may exhibit a three-fold increase in radiation tolerance. Amifostine is dephosphorylized to its active metabolite by a process involving alkaline phosphatase. Due to lower levels of alkaline phosphatase in tumor vessels, amifostine is marketed as a selective protector of normal tissue and not tumors. However, the preclinical investigations concerning the selectivity of amifostine are controversial and the clinical studies are sparse and do not have the power to evaluate the influence of amifostine on the therapeutic index., CONCLUSION: based on the present knowledge amifostine should only be used in experimental protocols and not in routine practice.",Excluded

1492,"Lack of correlation between villus and crypt damage in irradiated mouse intestine It has been observed that scanning electron microscopy is a more sensitive indicator of mucosal damage at low radiation dose levels than conventional quantitative crypt counting techniques. Three different fractionation schedules were subjected to investigation by both of these methods to try to elucidate some features of irradiation damage to the whole of the intestinal mucosa, at dose levels commonly used in clinical practice. Despite variations in the qualitative observations, there was a marked difference in two of the schedules between damage expressed as crypt counts and that described by the qualitative techniques. In the first case high crypt numbers were associated with severe mucosal damage, whereas the second schedule produced a reduced crypt count in association with low damage to the surface mucosa. A third schedule produced results in which there was a general agreement between low crypt numbers and considerable surface mucosal damage. However, observations were made of mucosal formations not previously seen on damaged mucosal surfaces. These resembled the appearance normally associated with the gut of patients suffering from coeliac disease. Variations in the qualitative observations were seen in all the schedules so that their interpretation in terms of perturbation of cellular kinetics is difficult.",Included

Decreased expression of 10 PPARalpha regulated genes including FGF21 was also uncovered. FGF21 serum levels were lower (p< 0.05) in OW dam offspring. Further serum levels of high mol wt adiponectin (p < 0.05) were decreased in OW dam offspring at weaning. While no changes in %fat mass or adipose tissue adiponectin mRNA were observed, hepatic expression of AdipoR1 and R2 were lower in OW dam offspring.

2769,"Dosimetric feasibility of real-time MRI-guided proton therapy PURPOSE: Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a prime candidate for image-guided radiotherapy. This study was designed to assess the feasibility of real-time MRI-guided proton therapy by quantifying the dosimetric effects induced by the magnetic field in patients' plans and identifying the associated clinical consequences., METHODS: Monte Carlo dose calculation was performed for nine patients of various treatment sites (lung, liver, prostate, brain, skull-base, and spine) and tissue homogeneities, in the presence of 0.5 and 1.5 T magnetic fields. Dose volume histogram (DVH) parameters such as D95, D5, and V20 as well as equivalent uniform dose were compared for the target and organs at risk, before and after applying the magnetic field. The authors further assessed whether the plans affected by clinically relevant dose distortions could be corrected independent of the planning system., RESULTS: By comparing the resulting dose distributions and analyzing the respective DVHs, it was determined that despite the observed lateral beam deflection, for magnetic fields of up to 0.5 T, neither was the target coverage jeopardized nor was the dose to the nearby organs increased in all cases except for prostate. However, for a 1.5 T magnetic field, the dose distortions were more pronounced and of clinical concern in all cases except for spine. In such circumstances, the target was severely underdosed, as indicated by a decrease in D95 of up to 41% of the prescribed dose compared to the nominal situation (no magnetic field). Sites such as liver and spine were less affected due to higher tissue homogeneity, typically smaller beam range, and the choice of beam directions. Simulations revealed that small modifications to certain plan parameters such as beam isocenter (up to 19 mm) and gantry angle (up to 10degree) are sufficient to compensate for the magnetic field-induced dose disturbances. The authors' observations indicate that the degree of required corrections strongly depends on the beam range and direction relative to the magnetic field. This method was also applicable to more heterogeneous scenarios such as skull-base tumors., CONCLUSIONS: This study confirmed the dosimetric feasibility of real-time MRI-guided proton therapy and delivering a clinically acceptable dose to patients with various tumor locations within magnetic fields of up to 1.5 T. This work could serve as a guide and encouragement for further efforts toward clinical implementation of hybrid MRI-proton gantry systems.",Excluded

All patients were followed up for an average of 18 months. Postoperative reduction was evaluated by Matta's criteria: Excellent in 16 cases, good in 9 cases, and fair in 3 cases. The Majeed score was used in the last follow-up to evaluate functional recovery: Excellent in 13 cases, good in 10 cases, fair in 4 cases, and poor in 1 case. There were no cases of operative vascular injury. Conclusion. The ""blunt end"" KW technique with a 3D printed external template is a safe and effective method for the placement of IS and superior ramus screws in unstable pelvic fractures with minimized surgical duration and radiation exposure.Copyright © 2019 Kaifang Chen et al.",Excluded

Blood samples were obtained at the beginning, after 6-10 exposures to BB UVB phototherapy (mean 5 weeks) and at the end of the therapy period (mean 21 weeks). Serum TBARS and nitrite-nitrate levels were evaluated., RESULTS: There was no statistically significant difference in serum TBARS and nitrite-nitrate levels between psoriatic patients (basal) and healthy volunteers. There was no statistically significant correlation between disease duration, disease severity, or the total cumulative dose of UVB and serum levels of TBARS and nitrite-nitrate in psoriatic patients. Total nitrite levels in samples obtained during and at the end of therapy were significantly higher than basal levels (P=0.033 and P=0.005, respectively). TBARS levels in samples obtained during and at the end of therapy were significantly higher than basal levels (P=0 and P=0.026, respectively). There was a negative correlation (r=-0.576, P=0.039) between the total nitrite and TBARS levels in psoriatic patients at the end of therapy., CONCLUSION: Our study showed that chronic exposure to UV irradiation may lead to a systemic effect on lipid peroxidation and NO levels, which are shown by a significant elevation in TBARS and nitrite-nitrate levels in serum.",Excluded
600,"Selective arterial embolisation for the treatment of mobile spine aneurismal bone cyst: Prospective study Introduzione: Aneurismal Bone Cyst (ABC) is a benign cystic lesion of the bone made of blood containing gaps separated by connective tissue. In 10-30 % of cases ABC is localized at spine level. Different treatment options are possible: 1) curettage and bone grafting; 2) en bloc excision; 3) selective arterial embolization (SAE); 4) radiotherapy; 5) combination of these procedures. The aim of this study is to evaluate prospectively the results obtained using SAE only for the treatment of ABC. Materiali e metodi: 20 patients (9 female, 11 male), mean age 24 years (range: 12-39 years), mean follow up 40 months (range: 9.4- 49.4 months) affected by Aneurismal Bone Cyst of the mobile spine without instability were analyzed. Patients underwent the same diagnostic protocol (X-ray, CT scan, MRI) and the same treatment (selective arterial embolization). The same evaluation protocol was used for all patients (X-ray, CT scan at 8 weeks following embolization). Risultati: From one to seven SAE were performed depending on cases. The mean length of hospital stay was 2.2 days for each embolization treatment (range 2-5 days). 18 patients on 20 were treated using SAE only. In 1 case, presenting progressive paraplegia due to T8 ABC, surgical decompression and T6-T10 fixation were needed. (Frankel E after surgery). After 3 months F.U. local recurrence was observed and it is being treated using SAE. In 1 case, presenting C7 ABC, an Halo Vest was necessary for 30 days, being substituted by a Minerva plaster for three months. 19 patient on 20 are classified as NED (no evidence of disease) at the last F.U. 1 patient as AWD (alive with disease). Discussione e conclusioni: ABC is a benign lesion but in some cases can be locally aggressive causing pain, loss of function, spinal cord, nerve roots or cauda equina compression and pathological fractures. Selective arterial embolization (SAE) was used first as adjuvant procedure to reduce bleeding during surgery. First, De Rosa in 1990 treated ABC using embolization only. Nowadays SAE represents an effective, safe and minimally invasive approach for the treatment of ABC. It could be considered the gold standard treatment for ABC without instability or neurological complications. In the case of failure or poor results surgical treatment must be considered.",Excluded

However, 5 to 10% of all individuals show increased acute and/or late reactions. In-vitro test systems are investigated for their suitability for predictive purposes. This paper attempts a correlation between the induction and repair of DNA damage measured in the comet assay and the clinical observed reaction in order to evaluate the suitability of the comet assay for prediction of radiation sensitivity. Patients and Methods: Skin fibroblasts of 30 patients with average tissue reactions or acute and/or late increased side effects and cell lines of 4 individuals carrying the heritable disease ataxia telangiectasia (AT) were irradiated in vitro. The induction and repair of DNA damage was measured at different time points after irradiation in the comet assay (single cell gel electrophoresis). These results were compared to the acute and late clinical reactions classified according to the RTOG grading system. Result(s): The radiation induced DNA damage decreased over time reflecting DNA repair. Cells of the AT individuals showed an elevated damage induction and a reduced repair capacity compared to patients with average tissue reactions. Fibroblasts of patients with increased acute and late side effects exhibited slower DNA repair. In addition to the known lack of cell cycle control, our results indicate that AT cells show reduced DNA repair capacity. Conclusion(s): The comet assay seems to be able to detect some types of increased individual radiation sensitivity. In contrast to other predictive in-vitro tests, the comet assay needs less time and fewer cells, which would be useful in a clinical setting.",Included
1839,"Use of unstable chromosome aberrations for biological dosimetry after the first postirradiation mitosis The loss of unstable chromosome aberrations after the first postirradiation mitosis makes their use difficult in radiation dosimetry. We describe here a method which, in a cell population observed at this stage, allows retrospective estimation of the frequencies of the unstable aberrations induced at the time of irradiation, and their use as a dosimeter. The laws controlling the behavior of unstable aberrations during mitosis were defined from a large-scale experiment on irradiated human lymphocytes. For cells undergoing the first, second, or third mitosis after irradiation, relationships were determined between the frequency, at irradiation time, of acentric fragments not arising from formation of dicentrics or rings, and the ratio of dicentrics and centric rings appearing without acentric fragments to the total number of dicentrics plus rings. On the basis of this ratio, the method described here provides an assessment of the postirradiation mitotic activity in a cell population. This assessment permitted estimation of the cell distribution and frequency of dicentrics plus centric rings, and of the frequency of acentric fragments at the time of irradiation. The use of this method for retrospective dosimetry after whole-body irradiation under various conditions of exposure is illustrated.",Excluded
915,"Effects of whole-body UVB irradiation on cytokine production by peripheral blood mononuclear cells from stage I melanoma patients Ultraviolet (UV) radiation causes significant impairment of immunological function in human skin. The immunosuppressive effects of UV radiation are thought to be due to local release of cytokines by human keratinocytes, leading to impaired function of epidermal antigen-presenting cells (APC) and failure to induce cutaneous delayed-type hypersensitivity (DTH) reactions. Recent studies have shown that individuals susceptible to UV-induced suppression of DTH may be more prone to develop skin cancer including malignant melanoma (MM). Since the causal relationship between UV radiation and the induction of MM still seems obscure, we investigated the immunological reactions of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) to whole-body irradiation with UVB in 15 stage I melanoma patients as compared to PBMC from normal volunteers matched for age, gender and skin type. Whole-body irradiation was performed with 0.8 minimal erythema dosages on five consecutive days. Peripheral blood was obtained before and after the procedure. Overall, there were no major effects of UVB irradiation on peripheral lymphocyte subsets and proliferation of PBMC from patients or normal controls, but UVB irradiation led to a significant increase in PWM-stimulated production of IL-6, IL-2R and TNF by PBMC. These changes were independent of the individual UVB dosages administered and appeared in both groups similarly. UVB irradiation did not lead to significant changes on IL-1 and IL-2 expression by PBMC. Our results suggest that PBMC participate in the cytokine response to UV, even in the absence of inflammatory reactions, but that this participation is not specific to MM patients.",Excluded
1026,"Osteoradionecrosis of the mandible after radiotherapy for head and neck cancer: risk factors and dose-volume correlations Background: The project aimed at determining the incidence of mandibular osteoradionecrosis (ORN) after radiotherapy, possible risk factors, and mandibular dose-volume effects in a large cohort of head and neck cancer patients (HNC). Methods: The cohort consisted of 1224 HNC patients treated with 66-68 Gy in 2007-2015 predominantly with IMRT. ORN cases were defined from clinical observations at follow-up and through hospital code diagnostics after oral-maxillofacial surgery and cross-checked with the national Danish Head and Neck Cancer database. In a nested case-control study, patients with ORN cases were matched with two controls (1:2) and pre-RT dental procedures including surgery to the mandible were documented. Multivariable Cox regression analysis was applied using demographic and treatment variables including dental procedures, smoking and tumor characteristics, and combined with dosimetric data. Mean mandibular dose (Dmean) was pre-selected for the multivariable model. Results: ORN was recorded in 56 cases (4.6%) with a median time to event of 10.9 months (range 1.8-89.7) after RT, 90% occurred within 37.4 months. Median follow-up time was 22 months (0.3-95). Average Dmean was significantly higher in the ORN event cohort and significant dose-volume differences were observed for population mean DVH doses between 30 Gy and 60 Gy. In univariable analysis, smoking (HR = 1.69; CI 1.14-2.5), pre-RT surgery/tooth extraction (HR = 2.76; 1.48-5.14), and several dosimetric parameters including Dmean (HR = 1.05, 1.02-1.08) were all significantly associated with ORN. Dmean and surgery/tooth extraction remained significant predictors of ORN in multivariable analysis, HR = 1.04 (CI 1.01-1.07) and HR = 2.09 (CI 1.1-3.98), respectively, while smoking only retained its significance in an interaction analysis with pre-RT dental procedures. Conclusion: The onset of ORN of the mandible was early (median 10.8 months) and the incidence low (4.6%) after IMRT in HNC cancer patients. Surgery to the mandible and pre-RT tooth extraction, tobacco smoking, and treatment dose were associated with the development of ORN.",Excluded

We prospectively evaluated Lodox R as a diagnostic imaging modality in patients with ureterolithiasis., METHODS: Conventional kidney-ureter-bladder (KUB) X-ray and Lodox R were performed in 41 patients presenting with acute flank pain due to unilateral ureteral stone confirmed by computed tomography. KUB X-ray and Lodox R images were then reviewed by four blinded readers (urology expert/resident, radiology expert/resident). Identification rates were compared using Pearson's Chi square test. The impact of different parameters on stone identification by Lodox R was evaluated using logistic regression and generalized linear mixed models. Inter-reader agreement was tested using Cohen's kappa coefficient., RESULTS: Median stone size was 5 mm (range 2-12), median stone density was 800 HU (range 200-1500). The identification rates of the urology expert were 68% for KUB X-ray and 90% for Lodox R (p = 0.014), and for all four readers 61% for KUB X-ray and 62% for Lodox R (p = 0.8). Radiation exposure for KUB X-ray and Lodox R was 0.45 mSv (SD +/- 0.64) and 0.027 mSv (SD +/- 0.038), respectively. Multivariable analyses showed an association between stone identification by Lodox R and stone size (p < 0.001), stone density (p = 0.005), lower body mass index (p = 0.005), and reader (p < 0.001)., CONCLUSIONS: The high identification rates and low radiation doses of Lodox R make it a promising imaging modality for the diagnosis of ureteral stones.

We found that, on average, the density of epidermal melanocytes 14 days after exposure to 2 minimal erythemal dose (MED) SSUVR was twofold higher than baseline (unirradiated) skin. However, the change in epidermal melanocyte counts among people carrying germline MC1R variants (97% increase) was significantly less than those with wild-type MC1R (164% increase; P = 0.01). We also found that sunscreen applied to the skin before exposure to 2 MED SSUVR completely blocked the effects of DNA damage, p53 induction, and cellular proliferation in both melanocytes and keratinocytes. © 2013 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

Retrospective study of 135 cases OBJECTIVE: To report the profile of histologic cervical nodes involvement associated with mobile tongue squamous cell carcinoma. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Our retrospective study concerned patients treated from 1978 to 1998 by cervical neck dissection for mobile tongue carcinoma. RESULT(S): A population of 135 patients (90 M/45 F, sex-ratio 2) with a 53.5 mean age (19 to 75) is analyzed. Clinical palpable nodes were present in 68 cases (50%) mainly submental-submaxillar (54). Histologic examination showed a node involvement in 54 cases without (32 cases) or with capsular rupture (22 cases) mainly in the jugulo-carotidian chain (46/54). Among the 67 clinically N0 patients collected after 1990, 22 patients (33%) exhibited an histological involvement vs 32/68 (47%) for the group presenting palpable cervical nodes for the whole period. Histologic node involvement seemed to be linked to the clinical status, node size and TNM stage. CONCLUSION(S): Cervical lymph node treatment needs to be systematic in mobile tongue carcinoma. The probability of histologic involvement is linked to the loco-regional extent of disease and influences the prognosis. In N0 patients, neck dissection is required because of the frequency of histological involvement, particularly when loss to follow-up may be expected.",Excluded

1375,"Increased oxidative stress in barn swallows from the Chernobyl region The Chernobyl nuclear accident produced the largest unintended release of radionuclides in history, with dramatic consequences for humans and other organisms. Exposure to ionizing radiation is known to reduce circulating and stored levels of specific antioxidants in birds and humans, thus potentially increasing oxidative stress. However, overall effects of radioactive exposure on oxidative status have never been investigated in any free ranging vertebrate. We measured plasma antioxidant capacity and concentration of reactive oxygen metabolites in adult barn swallows (Hirundo rustica) from colonies with variable background radiation levels in the Chernobyl region in Ukraine and Belarus. We predicted that antioxidants would decrease while reactive oxygen metabolites would increase with exposure to increasing levels of radiation at the breeding sites. Consistent with this expectation, radiation level positively predicted plasma concentration of reactive oxygen metabolites, whereas no significant covariation was found with non-enzymatic plasma antioxidant capacity. An index of oxidative stress was also larger in barn swallows exposed to high contamination levels. Thus, radioactive contamination appeared to be responsible for the increased generation of reactive oxygen metabolites and the imbalance between reactive oxygen metabolites and non-enzymatic plasma antioxidant capacity. © 2009 Elsevier Inc.

1359,"Differentiation between brain tumor recurrence and radiation injury using perfusion, diffusion-weighted imaging and MR spectroscopy BACKGROUND: Differentiation between tumor recurrence/vital tumor tissue and radionecrosis based on conventional diagnostic imaging is impossible because of the likeness of the images. In such circumstances advanced MRI techniques (PWI, DWI, 1HMRS) seem to be helpful. The aim of our study was to evaluate the diagnostic effectiveness of PWI, DWI and 1HMRS in the differentiation of the tumor recurrence from radiation related injury., MATERIAL AND METHODS: The retrospective analysis comprised 11 contrast-enhancing lesions observed in 8 patients treated for gliomas with radiotherapy or radiochemotherapy. 5 out of 11 contrast-enhancing lesions were tumor recurrences whereas 6 out of 11 radiation-related injuries. The MR examinations comprised of conventional MR imaging (T1-SE, T1-MPRAGE with CE, T2-TSE, T2 FLAIR) and PWI, DWI, 1HMRS. Mean and maximum rCBV values of each contrast-enhancing lesion were calculated. These values were normalized to normal appearing white matter. Mean normalized ADC ratio to normal appearing white matter and mean ADC obtained from contrast-enhancing lesions were analysed. In 1HMRS only those voxels which were placed in solid part of the contrast-enhancing lesion were analysed and Cho/Cr, Cho/NAA ratios presented., RESULTS: Mean normalized rCBVmax (2.44 +/- 0.73 for tumor recurrence vs. 0.78 +/- 0.46 for radiation injury; p < 0.001) and mean normalized rCBVmean (1.46 +/- 0.49 for tumor recurrence vs. 0.49 +/- 0.38 for radiation injury; p < 0.005) were significantly higher in the recurrent gliomas group than in the radiation injury one. It was observed that normalized rCBVmax higher than 1.7 and normalized rCBVmean higher than 1.25 is highly indicative for recurrent glioma whereas normalized rCBVmax lower than 1.0 and normalized rCBVmean lower than 0.5 is highly indicative for radiation injury. Results obtained in DWI and 1HMRS were not statistically significant different between two analysed groups. Mean ADCce: 1.06 +/- 0.18 x 10-3 mm2/s for tumor recurrence vs. 1.13 +/- 0.13 x 10-3 mm2/s for radiation injury; p = 0.51. Mean normalized ADC: 1.55 +/- 0.39 x 10-3 mm2/s for tumor recurrence vs. 1.55 +/- 0.18 x 10-3 mm2/s for radiation injury; p = 0.98. Median Cho/Cr ratio: (2.16min/max [1.67-3.15] for tumor recurrence vs. 1.34min/max [1.13-2.37] for radiation injury; p = 0.15), median Cho/NAA ratio (1.9min/max [0.86-2.36] for tumor recurrence vs. 2.11min/max [0.97 vs. 2.87] for radiation injury; p = 0.51)., CONCLUSIONS: Among the analyzed advanced neuroimaging methods PWI seems to be most reliable in differentiation between tumor regrowth/recurrence and radiation necrosis. In these results mean rCBV is a better differing factor than max rCBV.

2600,"Comparative stochastic effects of inhaled alpha- and beta-particle- emitting radionuclides in beagle dogs The stochastic effects of inhaled, insoluble particles of alpha- or beta- particle-emitting radionuclides were compared in dogs. Male and female beagle dogs were exposed briefly by nasal inhalation to relatively insoluble aerosols of 239PuO2 or 144Ce in fused aluminosilicate particles (FAP) and observed for cancer for their lifetimes. The initial lung burden and retention of each radionuclide was determined by whole-body counting of the emissions from 144Ce-144Pr- or 169Yb-labeled 239PuO2. Lung doses were calculated for each dog from these data. The lung doses ranged from 0.21 to 1200 Gy for 144Ce FAP and 1.6 to 58 Gy for 239PuO2. Dogs with doses to the lung of about 60 Gy or greater from 144Ce or about 2 Gy or greater from 239PuO2 had an increased incidence of lung carcinomas. In dogs exposed to 144Ce FAP, three organs were targets for neoplasia: lung, tracheobronchial lymph nodes, and heart. The insoluble FAP carried to the lymph nodes draining the lung delivered high radiation doses to the nodes and adjacent heart, resulting in hemangiosarcomas of these organs. In the lung, high radiation doses induced hemangiosarcomas and carcinosarcomas. At lower doses, carcinomas of various histological patterns were induced in the lung. In dogs exposed to 239PuO2, the lung was the sole target organ for neoplasia. Nearly all of these neoplasms were carcinomas of various histological patterns. These results indicated that relatively low doses of alpha-particle radiation can induce pulmonary cancers, but relatively large doses of beta-particle radiation are required. In addition, inhaled beta-particle emitters can also induce cancers in lung-associated lymph nodes and heart at these larger absorbed radiation doses.",Included
30,"Evaluation of a transparent perfluorodecalin-infused patch as an adjunct to laser-assisted tattoo removal: A pivotal trial BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Laser-assisted treatment of tattoos is well recognized to produce opaque epidermal whitening that prevents multiple sequential passes during a single treatment session. The amount of epidermal whitening produced in association with the procedure can be minimized by topical application of perfluorodecalin (PFD), which is an optical clearing agent. This pivotal trial assessed the ability of a transparent PFD-infused patch used in conjunction with a Q-switched nanosecond laser in the treatment of tattoos to permit multiple laser passes during a single 5 minute treatment session in comparison to the number of passes that could be completed using conventional treatment of the tattoo with the laser alone., STUDY DESIGN: Thirty subjects (mean age 37 years; 14 males) with predominantly dark blue or black tattoos were enrolled in a split-tattoo trial. One half of each tattoo was treated conventionally, whereas the other half was treated through the PFD patch. Treatments were performed using a nanosecond Q-switched 755-nm Alexandrite laser. The number of treatments performed in a 5-minute time period was quantified for each side of the tattoo (primary effectiveness outcome). Patient-reported pain scores and adverse events (AEs) were also evaluated., RESULTS: Significantly more laser passes could be made on average using the PFD patch compared with treatment using the laser alone (3.7 passes vs. 1.4 passes; P < 0.001). AEs were limited to those expected during laser removal of tattoos. The proportions of subjects with transient edema and erythema were lower in the PFD patch treatment group (36.7% vs. 63.3% and 33.3% vs. 70.0%, respectively); all AEs were transient and resolved quickly. No patient in either group exhibited dyschromia (hypo- or hyperpigmentation) in the treatment area at the 1-month post treatment visit. Additionally, when surveyed at the 1-month follow-up visit, all subjects (30/30) preferred to continue laser-assisted tattoo removal with the PFD patch., CONCLUSION: An average of 3.7 laser passes were made in a defined 5-minute treatment session when using the transparent PFD-infused patch, which is significantly more than was possible with the laser alone (average of 1.4 passes). Use of the PFD patch was associated with improved tolerability compared with conventional treatment, with subjects experiencing fewer and less severe AEs related to epidermal injury. Lasers Surg.

It can persist for several months or years and can have a significant impact on patients' quality of life., DESIGN: This was a qualitative descriptive study., METHODS: Semi-structured interviews were conducted with a sample of 20 participants. Inductive content analysis was used to analyse the qualitative data., RESULTS: Analysis of the manifest content identified five categories: communication problems, physical problems, psychosocial problems, treatment problems and relief strategies. The latent content was formulated into a theme: due to lack of information from professionals, the patients had to find their own solutions for their problems., CONCLUSIONS: Xerostomia is not only a biophysical symptom but also has a profound effect on the emotional, intellectual and sociocultural dimensions of life. The majority of patients continued to suffer from xerostomia and its associated symptoms after radiotherapy, in part, because of a lack of professional support, including the inability of nurses to provide oral health care., RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE: Nurses need to be knowledgeable about the effects of radiotherapy on oral mucosa and about appropriate interventions.

In C57BL/6J beige (bg/bg) mice, with low NK activity, metastasis to the lungs was increased and survival time decreased. In C57BL/6J normal (+/+) mice treatment with PK136, a highly specific monoclonal anti-NK antibody (Ab), caused a depletion of NK cytotoxic activity, as demonstrated using a standard 51Cr release assay. In animals bearing ocular tumors, treatment with PK136 Ab resulted in significantly increased pulmonary metastasis and an altered pattern of metastasis. The effect of combined treatment protocols using LS2616 (linomide) and cyclophosphamide (Cy) was examined in enucleated and unenucleated animals. Treatment with LS2616 and Cy resulted in a significant decrease in mean pulmonary metastases (MPM), a decreased frequency of metastasis to the submandibular lymph nodes and an increase in mean survival time. In enucleated mice this combined treatment protocol resulted in apparent cures, the lowest MPM and the longest survival time observed. When tumor-bearing mice were treated with either silica, carrageenan or sublethal gamma irradiation, no effect on metastasis or survival was observed.

2679,"Plasma concentration of Donepezil did not accurately predict tissue concentration: A dynamic whole-body PET study in humans Background: Donepezil hydrochloride (DNP) is acetylcholine esterase inhibitor most prescribed in patients with Alzheimer's disease. We previously reported its accumulation to brain, myocardium, and pancreas using PET with 11C-DNP. Objects: The purpose of this study was to reveal whether the DNP concentration in these organs could be predicted by measuring its plasma concentration. Method(s): Ten healthy volunteers (5 men and 5 women, age range from 40 to 58 year old, mean age 48.3 year old) were enrolled. 11C-DNP (220 MBq, less than 7mug) was intravenously infused for 1 min immediately followed by 7 repeated whole-body scans (7 min data acquisition in each scan) for 60 min. Radioactivity concentration in brain, pancreas, and myocardium was measured by PMOD software. Time activity curve (TAC) in plasma obtained from arterialized venous blood was measured at 10 time points. Metabolite fraction was measured at 30 min by using HPLC. We assumed linear increase in metabolite fraction during scanning and obtained metabolite-corrected TAC (cTAC) of 11C-DNP. We examined the correlation between integrated TAC and tissue radioactivity of brain, pancreas, and myocardium. We also examined the correlation between plasma radioactivity at single time point and tissue radioactivity in these organs. Result(s): There was no significant correlation between integrated plasma radioactivity (0 to 30 min, 0 to 50 min) and tissue radioactivity at 30 min or 50 min in brain (p=0.066, p = 0.096), pancreas (p=0.156, p=0.162), and myocardium (p=0.308, p=0.481). Metabolite fraction of 11CDNP in plasma was 21.2 +/- 8.6% at 30 min. By using cTAC, we also found no significant correlation between plasma and tissue radioactivity. Conclusion(s): Although plasma concentration has been usually employed to predict tissue concentration of drugs, in case of DNP, plasma concentration did not accurately estimate tissue concentration. PET with positron emitting nuclide-labeled drug may provide more accurate and direct information on the tissue concentration of drugs.",Excluded
57,"Failure patterns relative to radiation treatment fields for stage II-IV thymoma INTRODUCTION: The optimal radiation therapy (RT) field design for thymomas remains unclear. Here we report the failure patterns in stage II-IV thymoma after RT at two tertiary referral centers, classified according to the new International Thymic Malignancy Interest Group definitions. METHOD(S): We reviewed 156 stage II-IV patients with thymoma treated with definitive (n=24) or adjuvant (n=132) RT. All RT was delivered without elective nodal irradiation (median dose 5040 cGy). Intrathoracic failures were classified as (1) in-field failures (within 100% isodose line [IDL]), (2) marginal recurrences (<100% and >=50% IDL), and (3) out-of-field failures (outside the 50% IDL). RESULT(S): The median follow-up was 61 months. Surgical margins were positive in 39%. The median tumor size was 9 cm. The 5-year cumulative incidence of all intrathoracic failures was 24% (n=34). Failures occurred within the RT field (n=5), marginally (n=1), out-of-field (n=22), and synchronously in- and out-of-field (n=6). The 5-year cumulative incidence of in-field failures was 7%. These were associated with Masaoka stage and tumor size. Macroscopically positive margins were associated with more local failures. Intrathoracic failures occurred most commonly in the pleural space (n=29) and lymph nodes (n=9). Patients with more advanced stage, and those treated with intensity-modulated radiation therapy had more intrathoracic failures. RT dose and chemotherapy did not impact failure patterns. CONCLUSION(S): Although there were few in-field failures in patients who received RT for stage II-IV thymomas, a high rate of out-of-field intrathoracic failures still occurred. Further study is necessary to identify treatment approaches that prevent pleural recurrences. Copyright © 2014 by the International Association for the Study of Lung Cancer.",Excluded
2148,"Stereotactic ablative radiotherapy for patients with unresectable or medically inoperable cholangiocarcinoma Purpose: The role of stereotactic ablative radiotherapy (SABR) in patients with unresectable or medically inoperable cholangiocarcinoma remains unclear. We examined the efficacy and safety of SABR in this group of patients. Method(s): From January 2008 to December 2014, 15 patients with 17 lesions were included in this study. The lesions included 14 intrahepatic, 1 hilar, and 2 distal bile duct tumors. Three patients were classified as medically inoperable because of old age or multiple comorbidities. Tumors measured 0.8-13 cm (median, 3.6 cm). The median prescribed dose was 45 Gy delivered in 5 fractions over 5 consecutive days. Result(s): The median follow-up period for surviving patients was 29.9 months. Objective responses were observed for 10 of 17 tumors (58.8%), including 3 complete responses (17.6%). The median survival duration was 12.6 months, and the 1- and 2-year overall survival rates were 50.3% and 14.4%, respectively. The 1- and 2-year in-field failure-free rates were 61.5% and 30.8%, respectively. For patients with biologically effective doses (BEDs) exceeding 75 Gy10, the 1- and 2-year overall survival rates were 58.3% and 33.3%, respectively, compared to 20.0% and 0%, respectively for those with BEDs lower than 75 Gy10. Radiation-induced liver disease did not develop in any patient. Acute toxicities were generally mild and tolerable. Conclusion(s): Stereotactic ablative radiotherapy could be an alternative treatment for unresectable or medically inoperable cholangiocarcinoma. Further dose escalation may be considered to optimize local control.Copyright © 2017 Wichtig Publishing.",Excluded
603,"[Lung cancer screening with low-dose thoracic CT-scan in the Somme area] RATIONALE: This feasibility trial proposes to set up in the department of the Somme an annual screening for lung cancer with low-dose thoracic CT. It responds to the first objective of the third cancer plan and follows the publication of the results of the National Lung Screening Trial in 2011., METHODS: The method of this study is to use the existing networks among and between healthcare professionals and the departmental cancer screening structure. The inclusion criteria will be those of the National Lung Screening Trial. Screening will be proposed by treating physicians and chest physicians. The CT-scan will be performed in radiological centers that adhere to the good practice charter for low radiation scanning. A copy of CT results will be sent to the departmental structure of cancer screening (ADEMA80) which will ensure traceability and will perform statistical analysis. The study received funding from the Agence regionale de sante de la Picardie and la ligue contre le cancer., EXPECTED RESULTS: The primary endpoints of this screening will be the number of cancers diagnosed and the survival of the patients. The follow-up of positive examinations, delays in management and the level of participation will also be assessed. Copyright © 2016 SPLF. Published by Elsevier Masson SAS.

624,"Cerebral computed tomographic angiography using third-generation reconstruction algorithm provides improved image quality with lower contrast and radiation dose PURPOSE: We hypothesized that cerebral CT angiogram performed using third-generation reconstruction algorithm and lower contrast dose-low-kVp technique (LD-CTA) will provide better image quality when compared with regular contrast dose CTA at 120 kVp using a sinogram-affirmed iterative reconstruction algorithm (ND-CTA)., METHODS: Retrospective imaging review of 100 consecutive patients (50 each in LD- and ND-CTA groups). Two readers independently assessed the subjective image quality across multiple vascular segments on a Likert-like scale. Differences in contrast dose, CT dose index (CTDI), and dose length product (DLP) were compared using Mann-Whitney U test. Fisher's exact test was used to compare subjective image quality. Similarly, contrast- and signal-to-noise ratios (CNR and SNR) were compared in the mid-M1 MCA vessels bilaterally and the mid-basilar artery using Mann-Whitney U test. Interclass correlation coefficient (ICC) was calculated for the SNR/CNR values., RESULTS: Both observers showed excellent correlation in subjective image quality (mean percentage agreement of 95.2% for group 1 versus 89.2% for group 2). LD-CTA group showed better SNR and CNR (p < 0.0001) for both MCA vessels and the mid-basilar artery. Interclass correlation coefficient showed moderate correlation (0.51-0.63) between readers. LD-CTA group also used lower contrast (49 cc versus 97 cc in ND-CTA) and had lower radiation exposure (DLP/CTDI for both groups 268.3/80.7 vs 519.5/36.08, both < 0.0001)., CONCLUSION: Next-generation reconstruction algorithm and low-kV scanning significantly improved image quality on cerebral CTA images despite lower contrast dose and, in addition, have lower radiation exposure.",Excluded
2817,"Decline of natural killer cell activity in sublethally irradiated mice Spleen cells of (C57BL/6 X C3H/He)F1 mice were assayed for natural killer (NK) cell activity against YAC-1 and FBL-3 lymphoma targets at several intervals after total-body exposure to a high sublethal dose of 137Cs or 60Co gamma-rays. NK cell activity did not decline for the first 12 days but decreased sharply thereafter and remained low until day 24. The recovery of splenic NK cell activity was delayed. Beginning on day 28, the activity was slowly increased, reaching near-normal levels (80% of controls) 41-59 days after irradiation. Suppressor cells detectable during the period of lowest NK cell activity, i.e., on days 17 and 19, may have been responsible for the delayed and slow recovery. These studies indicated that a) mature effectors of natural cytotoxicity are relatively radioresistant renewable cells with a lifespan of about 2 weeks whose progenitors are radiosensitive cells b) the kinetics of decline and especially of recovery of NK cell activity may be influenced by suppressor cells. Should NK cell activity confer resistance to autochthonous lymphomas in vivo, it may be a significant consideration for strategies of tumor therapy by cytotoxic agents that reconstitution of the NK cell pool is a slow process and that suppressor cell function must be overcome for full recovery.",Included
537,"Adjuvant radiotherapy for low-risk early breast cancer in elderly women: Evidence from randomized trials Breast cancer is the most common cancer pathology in women in the Western world. The median age at diagnosis is 60 years and in the coming decades it is estimated that the number of elderly women affected reaches an important percentage. This aging of the cancer population, associated with its inherent comorbidities and aggravated by the lack of consensus about the most appropriate treatment, make it difficult to administer an effective postoperative treatment in elderly women with a low-risk profile. An exhaustive geriatric evaluation is a sine qua non condition to opt for a specific type of treatment. To date, several options are available such as endocrine therapy (ET) alone, moderate/high hypofractionation and various accelerated partial breast irradiation (APBI) techniques. In this article, we provide information about each of them. Copyright © 2020 Translational Cancer Research. All rights reserved.",Excluded

1486,"Risk of cancer after low doses of ionising radiation: retrospective cohort study in 15 countries OBJECTIVES: To provide direct estimates of risk of cancer after protracted low doses of ionising radiation and to strengthen the scientific basis of radiation protection standards for environmental, occupational, and medical diagnostic exposures., DESIGN: Multinational retrospective cohort study of cancer mortality., SETTING: Cohorts of workers in the nuclear industry in 15 countries., PARTICIPANTS: 407 391 workers individually monitored for external radiation with a total follow-up of 5.2 million person years., MAIN OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS: Estimates of excess relative risks per sievert (Sv) of radiation dose for mortality from cancers other than leukaemia and from leukaemia excluding chronic lymphocytic leukaemia, the main causes of death considered by radiation protection authorities., RESULTS: The excess relative risk for cancers other than leukaemia was 0.97 per Sv, 95% confidence interval 0.14 to 1.97. Analyses of causes of death related or unrelated to smoking indicate that, although confounding by smoking may be present, it is unlikely to explain all of this increased risk. The excess relative risk for leukaemia excluding chronic lymphocytic leukaemia was 1.93 per Sv (< 0 to 8.47). On the basis of these estimates, 1-2% of deaths from cancer among workers in this cohort may be attributable to radiation., CONCLUSIONS: These estimates, from the largest study of nuclear workers ever conducted, are higher than, but statistically compatible with, the risk estimates used for current radiation protection standards. The results suggest that there is a small excess risk of cancer, even at the low doses and dose rates typically received by nuclear workers in this study.",Included
2166,"Coloproctologic disorders of the pelvic floor Purpose. The aim of this review is to describe the most frequent and important coloproctologic pelvic floor disorders. Relevant diagnostic procedures of the pelvic floor will be presented. Material and methods. A host of diagnoses and symptoms such as the descending perineum syndrome, rectocele, cystocele, enterocele, uterine and vaginal descensus, anal and rectal prolaps, outlet obstruction, anismus, inertia recti and intussusception are included under the heading 'pelvic floor disorders'. Although symptoms are often varied, problems concerning urinary and/or faecal continence commonly lead to primary consultation of a physician. Results. Quite often, apparently divergent symptoms such as constipation and incontinence are simultaneously mentioned. A clear gender disposition is observed with female patients inflicted nine-fold in comparison to male patients. The primary consultant may belong to a variety of specialities such as urology, proctology, gynaecology or dermatology, depending upon the predominant symptom. A feeling of trust is essential for the treatment of a disorder involving highly intimate regions of the body. Discussion. An exact medical history and standardized proctologic evaluation consisting of inspection, palpation, rectoscopy and proctoscopy may be augmented by investigations such as anorectal manometry or endosonography. Conventional defecography has been replaced more and more by dynamic MRI of the pelvic floor in specialized institutions, enabling additional gynaecologic and urologic investigations avoiding ionizing radiation.",Excluded
1944,"Hand osteoid osteoma: Evaluation of diagnosis and treatment Background: OO (osteoid osteoma) is a common, osteoblastic, benign bone tumor but rarely seen in the hand region. There is still some debate about the diagnosis and treatment of hand OOs. In the present study, we aimed to evaluate the epidemiology, radiologic features, surgical treatment options and functional outcomes. Method(s): Between January 2003 and December 2014, surgically treated and pathologically verified 9 hand OO cases were investigated retrospectively. The preoperative and postoperative clinical outcome scores were calculated using the M2-DASH (Manchester-Modified Disabilities of Arm Shoulder and Hand) Score. Result(s): Lesion locations were as follows: middle phalanx in 2/9 (22%) patients (2nd and 4th digit), proximal phalanx in 6/9 (67%) patients (one 4th, two 2nd and three 5th digits) and metacarpal (2nd) in 1/9 (11%) patient. Incidence of nidus formation was 6/9 (67%) on X-ray, 7/9 (78%) on CT imaging and 2/9 (22%) on MR imaging. The mean time to diagnosis was 13.22 +/- 5.44 months. Preoperative mean M2-DASH score was 41 +/- 6 and postoperative was 7.4 +/- 8.6. Conclusion(s): Osteoid osteoma is usually seen below 25 years, and rarely found over 40 years of age. There is male dominance with a male to female ratio of 3:1. Delay of diagnosis may be encountered because of many differential diagnoses. When OO is suspected, CT imaging should be taken before the MR imaging. Because of superiority in soft tissue imaging, MR imaging should be an alternative tool in complex cases.Copyright © 2019 The Author(s).",Excluded
612,"Quantitative distribution of iodinated contrast media in body computed tomography: data from a large reference cohort Objectives: Dual-energy computed tomography allows for an accurate and reliable quantification of iodine. However, data on physiological distribution of iodine concentration (IC) is still sparse. This study aims to establish guidance for IC in abdominal organs and important anatomical landmarks using a large cohort of individuals without radiological tumor burden. Method(s): Five hundred seventy-one oncologic, portal venous phase dual-layer spectral detector CT studies of the chest and abdomen without tumor burden at time point of imaging confirmed by > 3-month follow-up were included. ROI were placed in parenchymatous organs (n = 25), lymph nodes (n = 6), and vessels (n = 3) with a minimum of two measurements per landmark. ROI were placed on conventional images and pasted to iodine maps to retrieve absolute IC. Normalization to the abdominal aorta was conducted to obtain iodine perfusion ratios. Bivariate regression analysis, t tests, and ANOVA with Tukey-Kramer post hoc test were used for statistical analysis. Result(s): Absolute IC showed a broad scatter and varied with body mass index, between different age groups and between the sexes in parenchymatous organs, lymph nodes, and vessels (range 0.0 +/- 0.0 mg/ml-6.6 +/- 1.3 mg/ml). Unlike absolute IC, iodine perfusion ratios did not show dependency on body mass index; however, significant differences between the sexes and age groups persisted, showing a tendency towards decreased perfusion ratios in elderly patients (e.g., liver 18-44 years/>= 64 years: 0.50 +/- 0.11/0.43 +/- 0.10, p <= 0.05). Conclusion(s): Distribution of IC obtained from a large-scale cohort is provided. As significant differences between sexes and age groups were found, this should be taken into account when obtaining quantitative iodine concentrations and applying iodine thresholds. Key Points: * Absolute iodine concentration showed a broad variation and differed between body mass index, age groups, and between the sexes in parenchymatous organs, lymph nodes, and vessels. * The iodine perfusion ratios did not show dependency on body mass index while significant differences between sexes and age groups persisted. * Provided guidance values may serve as reference when aiming to differentiate healthy and abnormal tissue based on iodine perfusion ratios.Copyright © 2020, The Author(s).",Excluded

While the efficacy of PUVA with oral 8-methoxypsoralen (8-MOP) is well documented, the use of its topical variation, bath-water PUVA therapy with 8-MOP has not been studied. The purpose of this study was to assess the effect of 8-MOP bath-water PUVA therapy in adult patients with early stage mycosis fungoides. We retrospectively evaluated the outcomes of bath-water delivery of 8-MOP (1 mg l(-1)) in 16 patients with early stage mycosis fungoides. In all patients complete response was achieved after a mean duration of 63 days requiring 29 treatments and a mean cumulative UVA dose of 33 J cm(-2). The time to relapse after complete clinical clearance was 45.6 (+/-9.2) weeks. In comparison, oral PUVA therapy with 8-MOP resulted in complete response after 64.5 days (25.8 treatments) with a mean relapse-free period of 30 (+/-3.5) weeks.

1032,"Immune events associated with protection in C57BL/6 mice immunized with anti-idiotypic antibodies mimicking protective antigens shared between gamma-irradiated cercariae vaccine and human resistance model of Schistosoma haematobium Immunoregulation is central for successful manipulation of schistosomiasis. Unlike schistosome vaccine development strategies that relied on direct selection of antigens from crude responses leading to selection of mildly protective antigens, the present study tested the utility of selection of potentially protective antigens encompassed rounds of immunoregulation via idiotypic network. Anti-idiotypic antibodies (Ab2) were purified from sera of New Zealand white rabbits multiply immunized with gamma-irradiated cercariae of S. haematobium, using adult worm specific idiotypes (Ab1) purified from sera of subjects resistant to reinfection. Ab2 was used for immunization of C57BL/6 mice and consequences of immunization were monitored before and after challenge infection with S. haematobium. Results showed an increase of splenic T cell expression of intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) and very late antigen-4 (VLA-4) upon immunization (average % stimulated cells 54.9 vs. 20.4, P < 0.05 for ICAM-1 and 31.1 vs. 6.6, P < 0.01 for VLA-4) and challenge, especially at day 6 (83.5 vs. 45.6, P < 0.01) for ICAM-1 and day 10 (50.4 vs. 20.8, P < 0.05) for VLA-4. Thereafter, both adhesion molecules declined at day 28 through 90. Similarly, lymphoproliferation was manifested upon immunization (OD570-630 0.27 vs. 0.09, P < 0.01) and challenge at day 6 (0.5 vs. 0.17, P < 0.01) through day 10 (0.49 vs.0.18, P < 0.05), then declined at day 28 through 90. Moreover, sera of Ab2-immunized mice exhibited an anti-anti-ids (Ab3) reactivity against antigens of approximate molecular weight 40, 80 and 160 kDa of adult worms, which were also recognized by Ab1. However, in contrast to Ab1, Ab3 showed no surface binding to 3 hr schistosomula. Strikingly, mice immunized with Ab2 showed strong resistance to challenge infection (approximately 82% reduction in worm burden, P < 0.001). Taking all, this alternative vaccine development strategy appears to filter out non-protective antigens. Indeed Ab3 recognizes much fewer numbers of antigens, which passed through two rounds of immune regulation. These antigens appear to represent a significant proportion of the protective response in the gamma-irradiated cercariae vaccine and human resistance model as well, providing the basis for an alternative vaccine for schistosomiasis.",Excluded

We compared the PET findings with computed tomography (CT), which was available in 21 (55%) patients, and tabulated the changes in the diagnostic evaluation and therapeutic management that were prompted by PET during a follow-up period of 10 to 36 months., RESULTS: Compared with PET, the extent of disease was underestimated by CT in 5 (13%) patients. Planned surgical resection of metastases was canceled in two of these patients. In another patient, surveillance PET detected an unsuspected hypermetabolic abdominal mass that was noted on a subsequent CT to arise from the small bowel. The mass was found to be jejunal metastatic melanoma at the time of resection. Overall, PET influenced surgical management in 3 (8%) patients, but it did not affect the wait-and-watch strategy or decision to initiate immunotherapy in the others., CONCLUSIONS: FDG PET contributes important information not provided by CT and has a substantial effect on the clinical management of patients with malignant melanoma.",Excluded

Clinically and environmentally relevant exposures occur predominantly under chronic conditions, notwithstanding that most studies of LDR effects have been performed using a single acute exposure. Sex- and tissue-specificity of the LDR-induced changes have not been considered before. We investigated LDR-related expression patterns in muscle, liver and spleen of male and female mice subjected to acute and chronic LDR exposure. Genes involved in oncogenic signaling were of specific interest, as radiation is a well-known carcinogen., MATERIALS AND METHODS: We analyzed the expression pattern of genes coding for growth factors and growth-factor receptors, cytoplasmic serine/threonine protein kinases, G-proteins and nuclear DNA-binding proteins, and other important components of oncogenic signaling., RESULTS: We found sex- and tissue-specific changes in the expression of Ras superfamily members (Nras, Rab2, Rab34, Vav2), protein kinase C (PKC) isoforms (PKCbeta, PKCmu), AP-1 factor components (Jun, JunB and FosB), Wnt signaling pathway members as well as in a variety of other cellular proto-oncogenes and oncogenes. Importantly, Western blot analysis of JunB, PKCmu and Rab2 proteins supported the transcriptomic data., CONCLUSIONS: Substantially different protein levels were observed in all three tissues (muscle, spleen and liver) of acutely and chronically irradiated female and male animals. Based on the obtained data and available literature, we discuss several possible mechanisms that may contribute to radiation-induced carcinogenesis in various tissues of males and females. From our results we could identify the genes that may serve as sex- and tissue-specific biomarkers of the LDR exposure.",Included

Method(s): Twenty-five consecutive patients (pts) were treated with RA. All showed locally advanced rectal adenocarcinoma with stage T2-T4, N0-1. Dose prescription was 44 Gy in 22 fractions (or 45 Gy in 25 fractions). Delivery was performed with single arc with a 6 MV photon beam. Twenty patients were treated preoperatively, five did not receive surgery. Twenty-three patients received concomitant chemotherapy with oral capecitabine. A comparison with a cohort of twenty patients with similar characteristics treated with conformal therapy (3DC) is presented as well. Result(s): From a dosimetric point of view, RA improved conformality of doses (CI95% = 1.1 vs. 1.4 for RA and 3DC), presented similar target coverage with lower maximum doses, significant sparing of femurs and significant reduction of integral and mean dose to healthy tissue. From the clinical point of view, surgical reports resulted in a down-staging in 41% of cases. Acute toxicity was limited to Grade 1-2 diarrhoea in 40% and Grade 3 in 8% of RA pts, 45% and 5% of 3DC pts, compatible with known effects of concomitant chemotherapy. RA treatments were performed with an average of 2.0 vs. 3.4 min of 3DC. Conclusion(s): RA proved to be a safe, qualitatively advantageous treatment modality for rectal cancer, showing some improved results in dosimetric aspects. © 2010 Richetti et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",Excluded

The aim of this retrospective study is to report oncologic outcome and toxicity of elective nodal radiotherapy (ENRT) in PCa patients affected by pelvic nodal oligorecurrence. Method(s): 41 consecutive patients were treated with salvage radiotherapy. At biochemical recurrence after primary treatment, oligorecurrent disease was detected by positron emission tomography (PET) in 94% of the patients. Image-guided intensity modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) was delivered using tomotherapy. 83% of the patients received androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) in combination with ENRT. Survival analysis was performed with Kaplan-Meier method, log-rank test was used to analyze associations between survival end-points and clinical parameters. Multivariate analysis was performed using Cox proportional hazards regression models. Toxicity was registered according to Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) v4.0. Result(s): The median at follow-up was 33.6 months. At 3 years, overall survival (OS), cancer-specific survival (CSS), and biochemical progression-free survival (b-PFS) were 89%, 92%, and 53%, respectively. At univariate analysis, all survival end-points were correlated with the number of positive pelvic lymph nodes at oligorecurrence (<= 3 vs > 3). Biochemical-PFS was correlated with PSA (p = 0.034) and PSA doubling time (p = 0.004) at oligorecurrence. At multivariate analysis, no independent variable was statistically significant. No patient experienced grade >= 2 late toxicity after radiotherapy. Conclusion(s): The number of metastatic lymph nodes and PSA doubling time seems to be important prognostic factors in the pelvic oligorecurrent setting. Salvage radiotherapy combined with short-course ADT might be a valid treatment strategy.Copyright © 2020, Federacion de Sociedades Espanolas de Oncologia (FESEO).",Excluded
1485,"Navigated minimally invasive unilateral laminotomy with crossover for intraoperative prediction of outcome in degenerative lumbar stenosis Background: Different surgical techniques have been described for treatment of degenerative lumbar stenosis (DLS). Only postoperative measures have been identified as predictors of efficacy of decompression. The objective of this study is to assess the role of navigated unilateral laminotomy with crossover to achieve and predict a satisfying decompression and outcome in DLS. Material(s) and Method(s): We enrolled patients with DLS who underwent navigation-assisted unilateral laminotomy with crossover. The extent of decompression was evaluated during surgery using neuronavigation. The outcome was assessed through the Oswestry disability index (ODI) and visual analog scale (VAS) for leg pain. Outcome correlation with the extent of the intraoperative bone decompression was analyzed. Finally, the outcome, surgical time, and in-hospital length-of-stay were compared with a control group treated through standard unilateral laminotomy. Result(s): Twenty-five patients were treated using the navigated technique (Group A), 25 using the standard unilateral laminotomy (Group B). In Group A, a cut-off value >=0.9 cm for bone decompression revealed to be an intraoperative predictor of good outcome, both regarding the ODI and VAS scores (P = 0.0005; P = 0.002). As compared with Group B, patients operated using the navigated technique showed similar operative times, in-hospital length-of-stay, ODI scores, but improved VAS scores for leg pain (P = 0.04). Conclusion(s): The intraoperative navigated evaluation of the bone decompression could predict the outcome allowing satisfactory results in unilateral laminotomy for DLS. The navigated technique also could lead to an improved decompression of lateral recesses resulting in better control of leg pain as compared to standard unilateral laminotomy.Copyright © 2018 Journal of Craniovertebral Junction and Spine Published by Wolters Kluwer -Medknow.",Excluded

852,"Stricture of the proximal esophagus in head and neck carcinoma patients after radiotherapy BACKGROUND. It is well recognized that many patients with head and neck carcinoma have problems with food intake and malnutrition. The objective of the current study was to determine the clinical pattern of patients with nonneoplastic stricture of the upper esophagus after radiotherapy for head and neck carcinoma. METHODS. A retrospective chart study of 22 patients with stricture of the proximal esophagus diagnosed between 1993 and 1999 at Karolinska Hospital was performed. The dose volume histograms of the first 2 cm and 5 cm, respectively, of the proximal esophagus were calculated. RESULTS. Five of the patients (23%) had total obliteration. The first 2 cm of the esophagus received at least 60 grays (Gy) in > 80% of the volume. Radiation injury was not reported to occur at doses < 60 Gy. There was a correlation found between dysphagia during radiotherapy and the development of proximal esophageal stricture. Stricture was diagnosed 1-60 months (median, 6 months) after radiotherapy. In 18 patients, the stricture was treated with single or repeated endoscopic dilation. These treatments allowed a nearly normal diet in 78% of the patients. CONCLUSIONS. Stricture of the upper esophagus is one deglutition disorder that is reported to occur after radiotherapy for head and neck carcinoma. In the current study, the authors emphasize the importance of knowing the tolerance of the normal esophagus to irradiation as well as early diagnosis of stricture of the proximal esophagus because this condition may lead to physical and emotional distress. © 2003 American Cancer Society.",Excluded
2705,"Chernobyl birds have smaller brains BACKGROUND: Animals living in areas contaminated by radioactive material from Chernobyl suffer from increased oxidative stress and low levels of antioxidants. Therefore, normal development of the nervous system is jeopardized as reflected by high frequencies of developmental errors, reduced brain size and impaired cognitive abilities in humans. Alternatively, associations between psychological effects and radiation have been attributed to post-traumatic stress in humans., METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDING: Here we used an extensive sample of 550 birds belonging to 48 species to test the prediction that even in the absence of post-traumatic stress, there is a negative association between relative brain size and level of background radiation. We found a negative association between brain size as reflected by external head volume and level of background radiation, independent of structural body size and body mass. The observed reduction in brain size in relation to background radiation amounted to 5% across the range of almost a factor 5,000 in radiation level. Species differed significantly in reduction in brain size with increasing background radiation, and brain size was the only morphological character that showed a negative relationship with radiation. Brain size was significantly smaller in yearlings than in older individuals., CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Low dose radiation can have significant effects on normal brain development as reflected by brain size and therefore potentially cognitive ability. The fact that brain size was smaller in yearlings than in older individuals implies that there was significant directional selection on brain size with individuals with larger brains experiencing a viability advantage.",Included
3117,"A retrospective review of the appropriateness of d-dimerordering and interpretation using wells' clinical probability criteria Introduction The D-dimer has been validated in diagnostic venous thromboembolism (VTE) algorithms. The highsensitivity of the assay allows for safe exclusion of VTE in patients with low clinical pre-testprobability and a negative D-dimer. The Wells score for Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT) and PulmonaryEmbolism (PE) are validated pre-test probability tools which help guide physicians on when to ordera D-dimer in patients with suspected VTE. However, we suspect these scoring tools are often under-utilized by physicians leading toinappropriate D-dimer ordering and subsequent interventions. We sought to explore the landscape ofD-dimer ordering at our institution. Methods We conducted a retrospective chart review of 482 patients in whom a D-dimer had been orderedover a 3-month period at the University of Alberta Hospital, a tertiary care teaching hospital inEdmonton, Canada. Charts were reviewed for patient demographics, specialty of ordering physician,apparent indication for ordering, patient risk factors for VTE and evidence of a pre-test probability(PTP) calculation. WIf no PTP score was documented, we retrospectively calculated Wells DVT or PE scores. VTE wasdeemed likely with a calculated Wells score for DVT 2 or Wells score for PE >4. In the case of highPTP for PE, patients should go directly to imaging and a D-dimer should not be performed. A cut offof >= 0.50 mg/L was deemed a positive D-dimer (STA-LIATEST). We also reviewed subsequentinvestigations thought to be influenced by interpretation of the D-dimer including:ventilation/perfusion (V/Q) and pulmonary angiography (CTPA) scans, and upper and lowerextremity doppler ultrasound studies. We then used multivariable logistic regression analysis toevaluate the proportion of patients who received imaging despite a low PTP and negative D-dimer. Results Seventy eight percent of D-dimers were ordered by Emergency physicians while 15.3% were drawnon admitted patients, and 5.8% in the outpatient setting. The indication for ordering was unknown in87 (17.5%) of cases. Pre-test probability scores were documented in only 8 (1.6%) of cases. All ofthose documented were the Wells PE score. When Wells DVT and PE scores were calculatedretrospectively, 30.0% and 17.1% (87 cases) were deemed 'likely' for VTE, respectively. However,imaging was performed in 172 cases (34.6%), including in 36 cases despite a negative D-dimer resultand low PTP. In contrast, 68 cases (17.2%) had a D-dimer performed with a high Wells PTP for PE despite therecommendation to proceed directly to imaging. VTE (either DVT or PE) was confirmed by imagingin 32 (18.6%) of cases, the majority (53.1%) had a high retrospective PTP. Conclusions Inappropriate ordering and interpretation of D-dimers remains a significant problem despite theimplementation of clinical guidelines and pre-test probability algorithms, namely the Wells score forDVT and PE meant to guide physicians. This leads to unnecessary cost, radiation exposure, andprolonged contact with the health care system for patients. This suggests the need for qualityimprovement initiatives which draw physician's attention to pre-test probability tools which cancurbing subsequent inappropriate investigations and improve patient care.",Excluded
2133,"Curvature in the cancer mortality dose response in Japanese atomic bomb survivors: absence of evidence of threshold PURPOSES: To investigate the evidence for a threshold in the cancer dose-response curve., MATERIALS AND METHODS: Japanese atomic bomb survivor cancer mortality data, based on follow-up to 1990, was used, taking account of random errors in DS86 dose estimates., RESULTS: For all solid cancers analysed together, there is a significant positive dose response (two-sided p<0.05) if all survivors who received <0.5 Sv are considered, but the significance vanishes if doses of <0.2 Sv are considered; the same is also true for leukaemia. For solid cancer mortality there is no indication of curvilinearity in the dose response: no statistically significant improvement in fit to a linear relative risk model is provided by addition of quadratic or threshold dose terms. If a relative risk model with a threshold (the dose response is assumed linear above the threshold) is fitted to solid cancer mortality data, the best estimate of the threshold is < 0.00 Sv (95% CI <0.00-0.13). If a linear-quadratic-threshold model is used the best estimate of the threshold is < 0.00 Sv (95% CI < 0.00-0.15). For leukaemia mortality there is highly statistically significant upward curvature in the dose response. In particular, if a relative risk model with a threshold (the dose response is assumed linear above the threshold) is fitted to the leukaemia data, the best estimate of the threshold is 0.16 Sv (95% CI 0.05-0.40) (two-sided p=0.001 for test of departure of threshold from 0). However, there is no evidence for a threshold effect (two-sided p = 0.16) when a quadratic term is included in the dose response: the best estimate of threshold in this case is 0.09Sv (95% CI <0.00-0.29). Moreover, addition of a quadratic term improves the fit of a linear-threshold model at borderline levels of statistical significance (two-sided p = 0.07). Therefore, the most parsimonious description of the leukaemia dose response is provided by a linear-quadratic function of dose., CONCLUSIONS: There is no evidence of threshold-type departures from the linear-quadratic dose response either for solid tumours or for leukaemia in the Japanese atomic bomb survivor mortality data.",Included
762,"Measurement of lung airways in three dimensions using hyperpolarized helium-3 MRI Large airway measurement is clinically important in cases of airway disease and trauma. The gold standard is computed tomography (CT), which allows for airway measurement. However, the ionizing radiation dose associated with CT is a major limitation in longitudinal studies and trauma. To avoid ionizing radiation from CT, we present a method for measuring the large airway diameter in humans using hyperpolarized helium-3 (HPHe) MRI in conjunction with a dynamic 3D radial acquisition. An algorithm is introduced which utilizes the significant airway contrast for semi-automated segmentation and skeletonization which is used to derive the airway lumen diameter. The HPHe MRI method was validated with quantitative CT in an excised and desiccated porcine lung (linear regression R(2) = 0.974 and slope = 0.966 over 32 airway segments). The airway lumen diameters were then compared in 24 human subjects (22 asthmatics and 2 normals; linear regression R(2) value of 0.799 and slope = 0.768 over 309 airway segments). The feasibility for airway path analysis to areas of ventilation defect is also demonstrated.",Excluded
1143,"Smartr nuclear imaging-clinical experiences of a new cardiac imaging system Background: Cardiac imaging is a large part of the Nuclear Imaging workload in Australia and New Zealand, there is many modalities and techniques in practice competing to provide good quality studies to the patients and referring clinicians. This presentation discusses one of the newest technologies available and how this new imaging technology has impacted on our department patient workload as well as patient outcomes including reduction of radiation doses, study efficacy and patient comfort/ compliance. Aim(s): To provide information to fellow Nuclear Medicine Technologists of new techniques in Cardiac imaging and how new scanning methods have changed patient radiation doses and patient workflow, as well as the improvements in patient compliance and comfort. Method(s): This presentation outlines the improvements from clinical practice and experiences over the last two years in a busy private nuclear medicine practice. Result(s): Since the introduction of new imaging technology in early 2014 we have experienced improved count sensitivity from this new technology as well as significant reductions in patient radiation dose. We have also seen better patient compliance and comfort levels, as well as changes in patient workflow though our department. Conclusion(s): Nuclear medicine must remain competitive with other imaging modalities to stay relevant in the dynamic environment of medical imaging. This new technology has the potential to do this. It produces the same if not better quality scan using a reduced radiation dose and decrease time, we have also seen improvements in patient comfort and compliance.",Excluded
1890,"Differences in the sensations of cold on the anterior torso of control and spinal-cord-transected individuals Application of cold stimuli to the sentient portion of the anterior torso of 12 spinal-cord-transected individuals (patients) and to comparable sites of 11 control participants showed that thresholds are lower for women than for men and that the difference between the sexes is maintained following spinal-cord transection. Patients of both sexes were more sensitive to cold stimuli than were controls. Estimates of stimulus intensity showed that participants reliably distinguished the 3 cool stimuli but that control women offered significantly larger estimates than control men. Spinal-cord transection produced an increase in the intensity of the sensations in women and a reduction in men. The changes in sensory perception that follow spinal-cord injury extend throughout the somatosensory system and involve all modalities. These changes cannot be explained as a simple release from inhibition. Copyright ((c) 2006 APA, all rights reserved).",Excluded
