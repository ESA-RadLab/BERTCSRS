3697,"[A cytogenetic analysis of the combined action of pesticides and irradiation on human lymphocytes] The efficiency of the combined action of pesticides and irradiation at the G(o) stage was studied in cultured human lymphocytes. Carbophos (malathion) increased the yield of chromosome and chromatid fragments in irradiated lymphocytes. Herbicide 2,4-D (dichlorophenoxyacetic acid) raised lymphocyte radiosensitivity by increasing the yield of chromosome type aberrations; the radiosensitizing effect of the herbicide decreased as its concentration increased.",Excluded
3552,"Subacute and chronic benign superior vena cava obstructions: Endovascular treatment with self-expanding metallic stents OBJECTIVE. Our purpose is to report our clinical experience with patients who underwent endovascular treatment with Wallstents for subacute or chronic benign obstruction of the superior vena cava (SVC). SUBJECTS AND METHODS. Twelve patients who were an average of 54 +/- 12 years old were referred for treatment of severe SVC syndrome related to implanted central venous catheters (n = 8), postradiation fibrosis (n = 2), a permanent pacemaker (n = 1), or a benign tumor (n = 1). Symptoms were present for an average of 16 weeks (range, 4-48 weeks) before treatment. Diagnosis of SVC obstruction was confirmed with helical CT and pretherapeutic phlebography. Four patients had Stanford's type II stenosis; two, type III; and six, type IV. The mean clinical and radiologic follow-up intervals were 11 months (range, 1-36 months) and 7 months (range, 1 week to 32 months), respectively. RESULTS. Recanalization was successful in all patients. Fifteen stents were implanted in the 12 patients. Stents were placed after percutaneous balloon angioplasty in nine patients, and primary stent placement was attempted in three patients. We immediately achieved a satisfactory SVC diameter in all patients, whose symptoms were relieved completely within 1 week of stent placement. No technical or clinical complications occurred. SVC syndrome recurred in one patient 2 months after stent placement and was treated by placing a second stent. CONCLUSION. Endovascular treatment with stent placement should be considered relevant and safe for refractory benign SVC syndrome. However, a larger series and a longer follow-up period are needed to define the role of stent placement for this syndrome.",Excluded
3518,"The outcome of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) patients treated with R-CHOP is not predicted by interim evaluation of 18-FDG-positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET) Background: In DLBCL patients PET evaluation has a defined role to assess the final response, but the predictive value of interim PET is contradictory. Standardized criteria of interpretation of Interim PET have not been well established yet and the visual analysis of PET results by dichotomous evaluation as positive or negative is difficult to apply. Aim of study. to determine the predictive value of interim (I-PET) and final PET (F-PET) on Progression Free Survival (PFS) in DLBCL patients treated with R-CHOP. Patients and Methods: From April 2004 to December 2008, 82 newly diagnosed DLBCL patients treated in five Hematology Departments were included. Clinical features were as follows: median age 56 years (19-81); 42 males and 40 females, 29 stage I-II and 53 stage III-IV; 47 L/LI and 35 I/IH IPI score. All patients were treated according to the planned therapy, not modified by I-PET results, with 6-8 RCHOP. IF-RT was planned to areas of bulky disease and given to 13 patients. All patients had PET scan performed at the diagnosis, during treatment (I-PET) and at the end of therapy (F-PET). All PET results were centrally reviewed and defined as positive or negative by visual dichotomous response criteria according to the First Consensus Conference (Deauville 2009). Result(s): All patients were evaluable for response. I-PET was performed after two R-CHOP in 46 pts, after three in 13 and after four in 23. At the end of therapy 73 pts (89%) achieved a CR and nine (11%) were non responders. Fifty-five patients (67%) were negative and 27 (33%) positive at the I-PET; 69 pts (84%) were negative and 13 (16%) positive at the F-PET. 15/27 (56%) I-PET positive patients became F-PET negative at the end of the therapy. The concordance between clinical CR and F-PET negativity was 99%: one CR pt was false F-PET positive due to parothid carcinoma. The prognostic impact of PET results on the outcome was evaluated. With a median FU of 18 months, Progression-free survival (PFS) was 80%. PFS did not correlate with I-PET results, 18-months PFS rates were: 84% in I-PET negative patients and 74%in I-PET positive patients (p.198) (Figure 1A). Conversely F-PET strongly predicted PFS (p.015): 84% in F-PET negative patients and 61% in F-PET positive patients. (Figure 1B). A further analysis for progression was performed to adjust the effect of I-PET analysis for other known risk factors (age >=60, stage, PS, IPI, LDH, bulky, number of extranodal sites, Bone Marrow involvement): only LDH (p.005) and IPI 0-2 vs. 3-5 (p.001) were confirmed as independent predictors for progression. The use of G-CSF during treatment did not influenced IPET results. Conclusion(s): Our results indicate that in DLBCL patients treated with R-CHOP a positive interim PET did not predict a worse outcome. Conversely, final PET results strongly correlate with PFS. A longer follow up is necessary to validate our data. Prospective larger studies and standarditation of criteria for interim PET are needed to assess the prognostic value of interim PET in DLBCL patients. (Graph presented).",Excluded
2607,"Initial results of a new generation dual source CT system using only an in-plane comb filter for ultra-high resolution temporal bone imaging Objectives: To prospectively evaluate radiation dose and image quality of a third generation dual-source CT (DSCT) without z-axis filter behind the patient for temporal bone CT., Methods: Forty-five patients were either examined on a first, second, or third generation DSCT in an ultra-high-resolution (UHR) temporal bone-imaging mode. On the third generation DSCT system, the tighter focal spot of 0.2 mm2 removesthe necessity for an additional z-axis-filter, leading to an improved z-axis radiation dose efficiency. Images of 0.4 mm were reconstructed using standard filtered-back-projection or iterative reconstruction (IR) technique for previous generations of DSCT and a novel IR algorithm for the third generation DSCT. Radiation dose and image quality were compared between the three DSCT systems., Results: The statistically significantly highest subjective and objective image quality was evaluated for the third generation DSCT when compared to the first or second generation DSCT systems (all p < 0.05). Total effective dose was 63 %/39 % lower for the third generation examination as compared to the first and second generation DSCT., Conclusions: Temporal bone imaging without z-axis-UHR-filter and a novel third generation IR algorithm allows for significantly higher image quality while lowering effective dose when compared to the first two generations of DSCTs.Copyright © 2014, European Society of Radiology.",Excluded
2747,"Emergency readmission following elective endoscopy: Audit of 29 868 day-case procedures performed at four teaching hospitals in northwest england Introduction Despite emergency readmission being a NHS quality indicator and unplanned admission after elective endoscopy a GRS auditable outcome; there is a lack of audit standards and difficulties in attaining these data due to limitations in hospital IT systems. Commercial analytical reporting tools that use NHS administrative data can generate local reports from HES and may serve as a starting point for clinical audit. Aim To determine the prevalence, demographics, aetiology and outcomes of emergency readmissions following elective endoscopy. Methods From 1.4.08 to 31.3.09 emergency admissions within 6 days of a day-case upper or lower GI endoscopy (ERCP excluded) were identified from analyses of NHS administrative data at RLUH, AUH, SRH, and SMUH. Using a standard proforma, each readmission was audited using case notes, endoscopy database, and the hospital informatics systems. Two senior doctors determined the validity of the admission subdividing them into; unrelated, possible and definite with the latter two categories defining an endoscopy readmission. Results Of the 29 868 daycases, 235 admissions were identified, of which 147 were endoscopy readmissions. The following data all relates to endoscopy readmissions. Demographics Male: Female ratio=1:1; Mean age (SD): 65.1 years (17).Readmission rate overall was 0.49%(0.56% for upper and 0.42% for lower GI procedures) with highest rates for therapeutic uppers (1.75%) > therapeutic lowers (0.56%) > diagnostic upper (0.47%) > diagnostic lower (0.38%). Aetiology The most common reasons for admission were vascular events (26.5%) > Symptoms such as pain (17%), GI haemorrhage (17%), suspected/confirmed perforation (17% (confirmed 6.1%))> respiratory (10.2%) causes >bowel obstruction (4.8%): Investigations 71% required simple blood tests and/or x-rays and 26%, cross-sectional imaging. Treatment 84.4% required only observation, 4.8%; surgery, 2.7%; repeat endoscopy, and 7.5% IV antibiotics. Outcomes 24.5% were short-stays discharges from either AED, or medical/Surgical assessment units. Mean LOS was 8.2 (13) days and 30-day mortality was 6.8%. Conclusion Commercial analytical reporting tools combined with local interpretation and multicentre collaboration was essential for determining useful information regarding endoscopy readmissions. Readmission rates predictably varied with the procedure type (0.38-1.75%) with therapeutic procedures having the highest. While most patients required simple observation/supportive care, LOS was considerable and mortality rate among readmitted cases was significant.",Excluded
3577,"Feasibility of ultra low-dose thallium stress-redistribution protocol including prone imaging in obese patients using CZT camera High efficiency cadmium-zinc-telluride (CZT) cameras provide an opportunity to lower the injected activities of radiopharmaceuticals for single photon emission tomography (SPECT) myocardial perfusion imaging (MPI). The limits for reducing activities of thallium have not been determined, particularly in obese patients. After an injection of 0.7 megabecquerel (MBq) of thallium/kg, we collected an average 1.5 million counts for the 10-min acquisition in a pilot cohort of ten patients. After extrapolation, we reduced the administered activity to 0.5 MBq/kg to obtain the expected 1 million counts. We studied the image quality in 124 patients (86 men, 43 obese with body mass index over 30 kg/m2) referred for MPI. The quality of images was assessed by a number of recorded counts and visually by a four-grade scale (one-poor quality, four-excellent quality). In non-obese and obese patients, the average number of recorded counts was 1.1 vs. 1.07 million counts for the 10-min stress acquisition, 1.04 vs. 1.06 million counts for the 13-min rest acquisition, and the average quality score was 3.97 vs. 3.90, respectively (p = NS). The mean administered activity was 39.2 +/- 7 MBq for non-obese and 48.7 +/- 6 for obese patients (p < 0.0001), and the calculated effective dose was 4.0 +/- 0.7 and 4.9 +/- 0.6 mSv respectively (p < 0.0001). The ultra-low-dose thallium stress-redistribution protocol, including post-stress prone imaging, provides good quality of images with a low radiation burden, even in obese patients.",Excluded
2320,"Lung cancer mortality associated with protracted low-dose occupational radiation exposures and smoking behaviors in U.S. radiologic technologists, 1983-2012 In the Japanese atomic bomb survivors, risk of lung cancer has been shown to increase with greater acute exposure to ionizing radiation. Although similar findings have been observed in populations exposed to low-dose, protracted radiation, such studies lack information on cigarette smoking history, a potential confounder. In a cohort of 106 068 U.S. radiologic technologists, we examined the association between estimated cumulative lung absorbed dose from occupational radiation exposure and lung cancer mortality. Poisson regression models, adjusted for attained age, sex, birth cohort, pack-years smoked and years since quitting smoking, were used to calculate linear excess relative risks (ERR) per 100 mGy, using time-dependent cumulative lung absorbed dose, lagged 10 years. Mean cumulative absorbed dose to the lung was 25 mGy (range: 0-810 mGy). During the 1983 to 2012 follow-up, 1090 participants died from lung cancer. Greater occupational radiation lung dose was not associated with lung cancer mortality overall (ERR per 100 mGy: -0.02, 95% CI: <0-0.13). However, significant dose-response relationships were observed for some subgroups, which might be false-positive results given the number of statistical tests performed. As observed in other studies of radiation and smoking, the interaction between radiation and smoking appeared to be sub-multiplicative with an ERR per 100 mGy of 0.41 (95% CI: 0.01-1.15) for those who smoked <20 pack-years and -0.03 (95% CI: <0-0.15) for those who smoked >=20 pack-years. Our study provides some evidence that greater protracted radiation exposure in the low-dose range is positively associated with lung cancer mortality.Copyright © 2020 UICC",Included
3183,"Image Quality Assessment of Abdominal CT by Use of New Deep Learning Image Reconstruction: Initial Experience OBJECTIVE. The purpose of this study was to perform quantitative and qualitative evaluation of a deep learning image reconstruction (DLIR) algorithm in contrast-enhanced oncologic CT of the abdomen. MATERIALS AND METHODS. Retrospective review (April-May 2019) of the cases of adults undergoing oncologic staging with portal venous phase abdominal CT was conducted for evaluation of standard 30% adaptive statistical iterative reconstruction V (30% ASIR-V) reconstruction compared with DLIR at low, medium, and high strengths. Attenuation and noise measurements were performed. Two radiologists, blinded to examination details, scored six categories while comparing reconstructions for overall image quality, lesion diagnostic confidence, artifacts, image noise and texture, lesion conspicuity, and resolution. RESULTS. DLIR had a better contrast-to-noise ratio than 30% ASIR-V did; high-strength DLIR performed the best. High-strength DLIR was associated with 47% reduction in noise, resulting in a 92-94% increase in contrast-to-noise ratio compared with that of 30% ASIR-V. For overall image quality and image noise and texture, DLIR scored significantly higher than 30% ASIR-V with significantly higher scores as DLIR strength increased. A total of 193 lesions were identified. The lesion diagnostic confidence, conspicuity, and artifact scores were significantly higher for all DLIR levels than for 30% ASIR-V. There was no significant difference in perceived resolution between the reconstruction methods. CONCLUSION. Compared with 30% ASIR-V, DLIR improved CT evaluation of the abdomen in the portal venous phase. DLIR strength should be chosen to balance the degree of desired denoising for a clinical task relative to mild blurring, which increases with progressively higher DLIR strengths.",Excluded
2780,"Computer-assisted surgery for dynamic hip screw, using Surgix, a novel intraoperative guiding system BACKGROUND: We present Surgix, a new computer-assisted surgery system (CASS). This system uses image analysis technology in order to measure three-dimensional (3D) distances, visualize implant templates and view the guided trajectory on standard fluoroscopy. Our purpose was to compare surgery results and technique with and without the Surgix CASS., METHODS: The study included 61 dynamic hip screw (DHS) procedures. The Surgix system was used in 41 procedures. We compared the number of guide wire insertion trials and the time needed for each trial, the number of X-ray pulses, tip-apex index, nine-quadrant position and shaft-neck angle., RESULTS: The procedures were carried out by experienced users (> or = five operations, using the system) and had a first-trial guide wire insertion success rate of 77.8%, compared to a rate of 10% for the control group (p = 0.001) and fewer insertion trials (1.33 vs. 3.05, respectively; p = 0.001). The mean number of fluoroscopy pulses was 41.5% lower for the experienced group than for the control (17.6 vs. 30.1; p = 0.009). There were no significant differences in tip-apex distance, favourable quadrant screw placement or neck-shaft angle., CONCLUSION: The results of this study demonstrate that the Surgix CASS significantly improves the accuracy of hardware positioning and reduces radiation exposure time, thus enhancing patient outcome.",Excluded
2982,"Three-dimensional analysis of recurrence patterns in rectal cancer: The cranial border in hypofractionated preoperative radiotherapy can be lowered Purpose: The aim of this study was to determine whether and where the radiotherapy (RT) clinical target volume (CTV) could be reduced in short-course preoperative treatment of rectal cancer patients. Methods and Materials: Patients treated in the Dutch total mesorectal excision trial, with a local recurrence were analyzed. For 94 (25 who underwent radiation therapy 69 who did not) of 114 patients with a local recurrence, the location of the recurrence was placed in a three-dimensionalthree (3D) model. The data in the 3D model were correlated to the clinical trial data to distinguish a group of patients eligible for CTV reduction. Effects of CTV reduction on dose to the small bowel was tested retrospectively in a dataset of 8 patients with three-field conformal plans and intensity-modulated RT (IMRT). Result(s): The use of preoperative RT mainly reduces anastomotic, lateral, and perineal recurrences. In patients without primary nodal involvement, no recurrences were found cranially of the S2-S3 interspace, irrespective of the delivery of RT. In patients without primary nodal involvement and a negative circumferential resection margin (CRM), only one recurrence was found cranial to the S2-S3 interspace. With a cranially reduced CTV to the S2-S3 interspace, over 60% reduction in absolute small bowel exposure at dose levels from 15 to 35 Gy could be achieved with three-field conventional RT, increasing to 80% when IMRT is also added. Conclusion(s): The cranial border of the CTV can safely be lowered for patients without expected nodal or CRM involvement, yielding a significant reduction of dose to the small bowel. Therefore, a significant reduction of acute and late toxicity can be expected. © 2011 Elsevier Inc.",Excluded
3478,"Phase i dose-escalation study of stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) for poor surgical candidates with localized renal cell carcinoma Purpose To evaluate the tolerability of escalating doses of stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) for primary treatment of localized renal cell carcinoma (RCC) in poor surgical candidates. Patients and methods Eligible patients included those with clinically staged radiographic and or pathologically confirmed RCC who had not undergone previous abdominal or pelvic radiotherapy. All patients had comorbid medical conditions which precluded surgery. Median (range) patient age was 77.6 years (range 59-89) years and all patients had Karnofsky Performance Status of >=60. Median tumor volume was 57.9 cm3 (range 13.8-174.7 cm3). Dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) was defined as grade 3 or worse gastrointestinal/genitourinary toxicity by Common Terminology Criteria of Adverse Events (version 4). Tumor response was assessed by imaging results using Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors (RECIST) measurement and percutaneous biopsy. Results A total of 19 patients (13 men and 6 women) were treated on protocol from June 2006 through August 2011. Groups of 3-6 patients received 24, 32, 40, and 48 Gy in 4 fractions. Median (range) follow-up was 13. 7 months (5.9-34.7 months). For possibly treatment-related acute toxicities, one patient developed grade 2 fatigue and one developed grade 4 duodenal ulcer. For possibly treatment-related late toxicities, 2 patients experienced grade 3 renal toxicity (worsening chronic kidney disease), one reported grade 2 urinary incontinence and one developed grade 4 duodenal ulcer. Among the 15 patients with evaluable response, 3 and 12 had partial response and stable disease, respectively, utilizing RECIST criteria. Among the 11 patients who had post-SBRT biopsy, only one (9%) was negative on first biopsy and an additional one (9%) turned negative without further therapy on second biopsy. Conclusions Dose escalation to 48 Gy in 4 fractions has been achieved successfully without dose-limiting toxicities. A planned extension of this phase I trial is currently underway treating patients to 60 Gy in 3 fractions to further evaluate this experimental therapy.Copyright © 2015 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

3013,"New effective dose estimates for Rubidium-82 based on dynamic PET/CT imaging in humans Objectives Published radiation dose estimates for Rubidium-82 vary widely, and no comprehensive study in man has yet been conducted. With the increasing use of Rb-82 PET for myocardial perfusion imaging, improved dosimetry information is needed for accurate risk assessment. The purpose of this study was to measure Rb-82 internal organ and effective doses with PET/CT in humans. Methods We recruited 26 cardiac patients and 4 normal subjects with no cardiac history. Dynamic 3D PET scans were acquired (GE Discovery RX/VCT) over 10 minutes following IV injection of 10 MBq/kg Rb-82. Images were reconstructed using FORE-OSEM and 8 mm Hann filter. Cardiac scans of the chest were acquired at rest for all 30 subjects, plus one additional scan of the Head, Neck, Abdomen, Pelvis, or Thighs. Mean Rb-82 residence times were determined in 22 source organs using volumes-of-interest (VOI) drawn on the fused PET/CT images. For large organs a small VOI was used to avoid partial volume losses. For small organs the average activity above 80% threshold was multiplied by the volume at 40% of the peak value within the organ VOI. Target organ doses and the effective dose estimate were calculated using OLINDA/EXM 1.0 according to ICRP 60, and recalculated according to ICRP 103. Results A total of 283 organs were measured across the 60 scans, with at least 4 samples obtained in each source organ. The average 'adult' effective dose for Rubidium-82 was found to be 0.00074 mSv/MBq using ICRP 60. Using ICRP 103, the male and female effective doses were 0.00074 and 0.00092 mSv/MBq respectively. The highest absorbed organ dose was to the kidneys. Conclusions These dose estimates for Rubidium-82 are the first to be measured directly with PET/CT in humans, and are 4 to 4.5 times lower than previous ICRP 60 values based on a theoretical blood flow model. The new values derived from human studies suggest a typical effective dose of 0.6 mSv per scan with 3D PET.",Excluded
2681,"Comparisons of postoperative complications and nutritional status after proximal laparoscopic gastrectomy with esophagogastrostomy and double-tract reconstruction Background The purpose of this study was to compare postoperative complications and nutritional status between esophagogastrostomy and double-tract reconstruction in patients who underwent laparoscopic proximal gastrectomy, and assess the advantages of both surgical procedures. Methods Between 2010 and 2018, 47 cases underwent proximal gastrectomy with esophagogastrostomy (n = 23) or double-tract reconstruction (n = 24) at our institu-tion for the treatment of clinical T1N0 adenocarcinoma located in the upper third of the stomach. Patient clinical characteristics, short-term outcomes, nutrition status, and skeletal muscle index were compared among the two groups. Results There was no significant difference between esophagogastrostomy and double-tract reconstruction in terms of operation time, blood loss, and length of postoperative hospital stay. Reflux symptoms and anastomotic stenosis were significantly higher in the esophagogastrostomy group compared with the double-tract reconstruction group (P < 0.001 and P = 0.004, respectively). There was no significant difference in anastomotic leakage, surgical site infection, and pancre-atic fistula. For the nutritional status, the decrease rate of cholinesterase was significantly higher in the esopha-gogastrostomy group compared with the double-tract reconstruction group at 6 months (P = 0.008) There was no significant difference in the decrease rate of skeletal muscle mass index at 1 year after surgery. Conclusion Compared with esophagogastrostomy, double-tract reconstruction tends to have better short-term nutritional status and postoperative outcomes in terms of preventing the occurrence of gastroesophageal reflux and anastomosis stenosis. These findings suggest that double-tract reconstruction may be a useful method in laparoscopic proximal gastrectomy.Copyright © 2020 Tottori University Medical Press.",Excluded
2902,"Evaluation and treatment results of trimodality therapy for advanced esophageal squamous cell carcinoma Objectives: The prognosis for highly advanced esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) remains poor, and there is currently no standard treatment. The purpose of this study was to examine the benefits of trimodality therapy [chemoradiation plus surgery, (CRT + S)] by evaluating the surgical outcomes of patients with ESCC in Keiyukai Sapporo Hospital, Japan. We assessed the preoperative and postoperative adverse events, treatment effects of preoperative CRT, metastatic diagnosis of the dissected lymph nodes, and survival. Patients and Methods: Between 2012 and 2018, 148 patients with highly advanced ESCC who underwent preoperative CRT + S were analyzed for diagnosis and staging, preoperative complications, clinical and histopathological effects of CRT in the resected specimens, survival rates, and recurrences. Result(s): The grade 3 and higher complications of preoperative CRT were neutropenia in 3 cases and thrombocytopenia in 1 case. Among the postoperative complications, there were 2 cases (1.4%) of direct surgical death, only tracheobronchial bleeding and liver failure. Using the 11th edition of the classification of esophageal cancer by the Japanese Esophageal Society, 60 patients (40.5%) were classified as grade 3 (negative for cancer cells, pathological complete response). However, 20 of them (33.3%) had metastatic tumor cells in the lymph nodes. The overall 5-year survival rate was 58.5%. Including references to the pathological findings and recurrence patterns, there is no effective diagnostic method for selecting the subsequent approach based on the effectiveness of CRT. Conclusion(s): Planned surgery following CRT was the only solution for achieving better treatment results. CRT + S is a promising treatment with low direct surgical mortality.Copyright © 2020, The Japan Esophageal Society.",Excluded
3207,"Experiences of xerostomia after radiotherapy in patients with head and neck cancer: A qualitative study AIMS AND OBJECTIVES: To describe the experiences of radiation-induced xerostomia in patients with head and neck cancer., BACKGROUND: Xerostomia is the most commonly occurring complication during and following radiotherapy. It can persist for several months or years and can have a significant impact on patients' quality of life., DESIGN: This was a qualitative descriptive study., METHODS: Semi-structured interviews were conducted with a sample of 20 participants. Inductive content analysis was used to analyse the qualitative data., RESULTS: Analysis of the manifest content identified five categories: communication problems, physical problems, psychosocial problems, treatment problems and relief strategies. The latent content was formulated into a theme: due to lack of information from professionals, the patients had to find their own solutions for their problems., CONCLUSIONS: Xerostomia is not only a biophysical symptom but also has a profound effect on the emotional, intellectual and sociocultural dimensions of life. The majority of patients continued to suffer from xerostomia and its associated symptoms after radiotherapy, in part, because of a lack of professional support, including the inability of nurses to provide oral health care., RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE: Nurses need to be knowledgeable about the effects of radiotherapy on oral mucosa and about appropriate interventions. The healthcare system requires a symptom management platform for radiation-induced complications, to help patients, their families and healthcare professionals obtain information about self-care, treatments and relief strategies.

3316,"Detection of renal dysfunction by point-of-care creatinine testing in patients undergoing peripheral MR angiography OBJECTIVE. The objective of our study was to analyze the effectiveness of prestudy questionnaires in identifying at-risk patients and estimate the prevalence of chronic kidney disease (CKD), nephrogenic systemic fibrosis risk factors, and other comorbidities in patients scheduled to undergo lower extremity MR angiography (MRA) studies using gadoliniumbased contrast agents. MATERIALS AND METHODS. Patent demographics, comorbidities, contrast type, and point-of-care (POC) serum creatinine values were recorded from the medical records of consecutive patients undergoing lower extremity MRA examinations in a single year. Patients were divided into groups by CKD stage (non-CKD, stage III, stage IV, or stage V) on the basis of estimated glomerular filtration rate values determined from POC creatinine results. Patient awareness of a history of CKD was noted if patients admitted to any form of CKD on prestudy questionnaires. RESULTS. Of 199 patients, 72 patients (36.2%) had stage III CKD, six patients (3.0%) had stage IV CKD, and seven patients (3.5%) had stage V CKD. Comorbidities - including smoking status, transplant status, and presence of diabetes, hypertension, and coronary artery disease - as well as administered contrast type and dosage showed significant differences among the CKD groups (p < 0.05). Only five stage III patients (7%) were aware of any history of renal dysfunction, whereas three stage IV patients (50%) and seven stage V patients (100%) admitted any history of renal dysfunction via questionnaires. CONCLUSION. Compared with POC creatinine testing, a prestudy questionnaire used alone is ineffective in identifying all patients with histories of CKD who are scheduled to undergo gadolinium-based peripheral MRA studies. © American Roentgen Ray Society.",Excluded
3473,"Image quality and radiation dose of dual-energy CT of the head and neck compared with a standard 120-kVp acquisition BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: DECT offers additional image datasets with potential benefits, but its use for H&N imaging is not justified unless image quality is preserved without increased radiation dose. The aim of this work was to compare image quality and radiation dose between a DE-derived WA image dataset and a standard SECT acquisition of the H&N. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Thirty-two patients underwent DECT of the H&N (tube voltages 80 and Sn140 kVp) and were compared with the last 32 patients who underwent standard SECT (120 kVp) on the same dual-source scanner. WA images from the 2 DE tubes were compared with images obtained with an SE mode. Radiation doses and attenuation measurements of the internal jugular vein, submandibular gland, and sternomastoid and tongue muscles were compared. Objective image noise was compared at 5 anatomic levels. Two blinded readers compared subjective image quality by using 5-point grading scales. RESULT(S): CTDIvol was 12% lower with DE than with SECT, a difference of 1.5 mGy, (P < .0001). Objective noise was not significantly different between DE and SECT at any of the anatomic levels (P > .05). No significant differences in attenuation measurements were observed between DE and SECT (P > .05). No significant differences in subjective image quality scores were observed between DE and SECT at any of the 5 anatomic levels (P > .05). CONCLUSION(S): DE-derived WA images of the H&N are equivalent to standard SE acquisitions and thus can be used for routine diagnostic purposes. Multiple additional image datasets can be obtained with no radiation dose penalty.",Excluded
3061,"A prospective study comparing the predictions of doctors versus models for treatment outcome of lung cancer patients: a step toward individualized care and shared decision making BACKGROUND: Decision Support Systems, based on statistical prediction models, have the potential to change the way medicine is being practiced, but their application is currently hampered by the astonishing lack of impact studies. Showing the theoretical benefit of using these models could stimulate conductance of such studies. In addition, it would pave the way for developing more advanced models, based on genomics, proteomics and imaging information, to further improve the performance of the models., PURPOSE: In this prospective single-center study, previously developed and validated statistical models were used to predict the two-year survival (2yrS), dyspnea (DPN), and dysphagia (DPH) outcomes for lung cancer patients treated with chemo radiation. These predictions were compared to probabilities provided by doctors and guideline-based recommendations currently used. We hypothesized that model predictions would significantly outperform predictions from doctors., MATERIALS AND METHODS: Experienced radiation oncologists (ROs) predicted all outcomes at two timepoints: (1) after the first consultation of the patient, and (2) after the radiation treatment plan was made. Differences in the performances of doctors and models were assessed using Area Under the Curve (AUC) analysis., RESULTS: A total number of 155 patients were included. At timepoint #1 the differences in AUCs between the ROs and the models were 0.15, 0.17, and 0.20 (for 2yrS, DPN, and DPH, respectively), with p-values of 0.02, 0.07, and 0.03. Comparable differences at timepoint #2 were not statistically significant due to the limited number of patients. Comparison to guideline-based recommendations also favored the models., CONCLUSION: The models substantially outperformed ROs' predictions and guideline-based recommendations currently used in clinical practice.

3016,"Dose and Location of Irradiation Determine Survival for Patients with Hepatocellular Carcinoma with Macrovascular Invasion in External Beam Radiation Therapy Aim: Prognosis of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) with macrovascular invasion (MVI) is extremely poor. However, proper therapeutic strategies have not been established yet. The purpose of this study is to identify the effects of external beam radiation therapy (EBRT) for MVI of HCC. Method(s): We have analyzed and evaluated 80 consecutive patients with HCC with MVI who underwent EBRT, and factors associated with enhanced survival in EBRT were evaluated by univariate and multivariate analysis. Result(s): The local response rate of radiotherapy for the irradiated MVI was 66.2%. The time to progression of the irradiated MVI was 5.8 months. Univariate and multivariate analyses showed that the higher irradiation dose (over 45 Gy) and the irradiation location (hepatic vein tumor thrombus - HVTT) were significant factors associated with survival benefits of EBRT. The response of EBRT for HVTT was significantly superior to that for portal vein or bile duct tumor thrombus. Conclusion(s): We conclude that a multidisciplinary therapeutic strategy based on EBRT should be proactively selected in the treatment of advanced HCC with MVI.Copyright © 2019 S.

3275,"Untreated male osteoporosis: Case report Objective: To underline problems connected with osteoporosis in men through case report. There are need to clarify the pathogenesis of osteoporosis and fractures in men and to develop diagnostic criteria as well as establish most effective treatment. Material(s) and Method(s): After low intensive trauma 64 years old man had back pain and pain in left forearm. X-ray show fractures of Th 12 and L2 vertebrae and left forearm. In his personal history there is also after low intensive trauma elbow and hip fracture in ages of 52 and 53. There are no other risk factor in personal and family history. DXA evaluation results: T-score total LS vertebrae -4.7 SD and T-score total -2.4 healthy hip. Laboratory tests: high rate of thyroid hormone and low rate of 25OH vitamin D. We started with treatment. Result(s): Osteoporosis is leading causes of morbidity and mortality in elderly. "" Silent disease"" progress without symptoms until a fractures occurred. Hip fracture is very serious complication. One fifth of it occurred in men but it rise about 10 years later than in woman. In 65-70 ages men loosing bone mass at the same rate as woman and the absorption of calcium decrease in both sex. For men before 65 years and high risk men recommendation is to begin periodic osteoporotic risk assessment and performing DXA. When we have diagnosis it is important to consider and exclude secondary causes of bone loss. It is almost certain lifestyle, diseases and medications. More than 40 % are primary or idiopathic osteoporosis in men. Careful history, physical examination and laboratory tests are enough component for making decision about treatment. Except medication men should be educated about adequate lifestyle measures as the prevention. Conclusion(s): Osteoporosis in men is an important and often overlooked problem. The consequences of it are underestimated and the condition is often unrecognised and untreated. There is no sufficient scientific based evidence for men osteoporosis. It is still an important public health problem.",Excluded
3394,"The utility of PET/CT in staging and assessment of treatment response of nasopharyngeal cancer Introduction: The aim of this study was to evaluate the impact of positron emission tomography/computerised tomography (PET/CT) as an adjunct to conventional imaging (CI) in the management of nasopharyngeal cancer (NPC) both for initial staging and assessment of post-treatment response. Method(s): All NPC cases referred to the Peter MacCallum Centre for Metabolic Imaging between January 2002 and December 2007 were identified. In patients undergoing initial staging, any differences between the pre-PET/CT management plan based on CI and that following performance of the PET/CT scan were noted. Clinical impact was scored using the Centre's published criteria: 'high' if PET/CT changed the primary treatment modality or intent, 'medium' if treatment modality was unchanged but the radiotherapy technique or dose was altered, and 'low' if there was no change in treatment modality or intent. Patients undergoing PET/CT following definitive treatment were scored according to whether or not they achieved a complete metabolic response. Result(s): Forty-eight patients underwent a staging PET/CT. The clinical impact was high in 8%, medium in 25% and low in 66% of patients. Twenty-one patients were scanned for post-treatment response. PET/CT was less frequently equivocal than MRI (3 vs 8/21). A complete metabolic response on PET/CT was associated with a 93% negative predictive value for subsequent recurrence. Conclusion(s): PET/CT is a valuable staging tool for the detection of occult metastatic disease and defining the extent of neck nodal disease. Post-treatment, a complete metabolic response on PET/CT has a very high negative predictive value with fewer equivocal results than MRI. © 2011 The Royal Australian and New Zealand College of Radiologists.",Excluded
2543,"Effects of a static magnetic field on audiogenic seizures in black Swiss mice Effects of a static magnetic field (SMF) with strong gradient components were studied in black Swiss mice. Exposure to SMF (100-220 mT, 15-40 T/m for 1h) did not affect the threshold for detecting auditory brainstem responses. Serial seizures elevated the hearing threshold at some frequencies, but there was no difference between SMF-exposed and unexposed control mice. EEG changes were recorded during audiogenic seizures. Pretreatment with SMF prolonged seizure latency in response to stimulation with white noise of increasing intensity from 74 to 102 dBA (1 min interval between 2 and 4 dBA increments) without significant effects on seizure severity. Gender-related differences were not statistically significant. Stimulation with 10 min sound steps revealed prolongation of latency and reduction of seizure severity in SMF-exposed, but not unexposed, mice. Pretreatment with phenytoin (5 mg/kg) in combination with SMF had significantly greater effects on seizure latency and severity than either pretreatment alone. These findings indicate that the SMF studied here under different conditions elevated seizure threshold and had anticonvulsant properties in Black Swiss mice and increased the efficacy of a conventional anticonvulsant drug.",Excluded
3574,"Dorsal skin reactions to sunlight and artificial ultraviolet light in hairless descendants of Mexican hairless dogs Dorsal skin reactions to irradiation with two different types of ultraviolet (UV) light sources (sunlight and artificial UV light) were investigated in hairless descendants of Mexican hairless dogs. The total energy dose of solar UV exposure and artificial UV irradiation was 90 kJ/m2 and 40 kJ/m2, respectively. Histological examinations were done up to 7 days after UV irradiation (7 DAI). At 1 DAI, the solar UV-exposed skin did not show marked changes, while artificial UV irradiated skin exhibited a visible erythematous reaction and prominent histological alterations such as epidermal thickening, appearance of sunburn cells and deformation elastic fibers. At 4 DAI of solar UV-exposure, the skin color became moderately dark and noticeable pigmentation developed in the epidermis. In contrast, at 4 DAI of artificial UV irradiation, there still remained moderate degeneration in the epidermis and dermis, and delayed tanning was weak. At 7 DAI of solar exposure, delayed suntan reactions became more prominent. Histologically, there were heavy pigmentation of melanin granules mainly in the stratum basale. On the other hand, artificial UV irradiated skin showed less pigmentation. Thus, solar exposure provoked remarkable pigmentation while artificial UV irradiation brought about severe sunburn reactions in the dorsal skin of hairless dogs.",Excluded
3155,"Treatment of metastatic gastric adenocarcinoma with image-guided high-dose rate, interstitial brachytherapy as second-line or salvage therapy PURPOSE We aimed to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of image-guided high-dose rate interstitial brachytherapy (iBT) for the treatment of patients with hepatic, lymphatic, and pancreatic metastases originating from gastric cancer, an entity rarely surgically treatable with curative intent. METHODS Twelve patients with a cumulative number of 36 metastases (29 liver, 2 pancreatic, 5 lymph node) from histologically proven gastric adenocarcinoma received iBT between 2010 and 2016 and were retrospectively analyzed. Every patient underwent palliative chemotherapy prior to iBT. The iBT procedure employs a temporarily, intratumorally placed iridium-192 source in a single fraction with the goal of tumor cell eradication. Effectiveness was assessed clinically and by radiologic imaging every three months. RESULTS Local tumor control was achieved in 32 of all treated metastases (89%). Four lesions showed a local recurrence after 7 months. Lesion sizes varied from 9 to 102 mm with a median of 20 mm. The median progression-free survival was 6.6 months (range, 1.8-46.8 months). The median overall survival was 11.4 months (range, 5-47 months). One patient suffered a major complication following iBT, hepatic hematoma and abscess (Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events grade 3), successfully dealt with by transcutaneous drainage. CONCLUSION iBT is an overall safe procedure, which facilitates high rates of local tumor control in treatment of metastatic gastric adenocarcinoma. Compared with surgical metastasectomy, similar overall survival rates could be achieved in our patient collective after iBT application.Copyright © Turkish Society of Radiology 2019.",Excluded
2628,"Modifications of the cutaneous microrelief in the superficial radiation-induced fibrosis: Qualitative study Cutaneous radiation-induced fibrosis (RIF) is characterized by a skin retraction or atrophy, toughness to the palpation and often entails functional limitation. Its clinical evaluation remains poorly quantified. The aim of this study was to propose an analytical method to quantify RIF skin surface with the replica technique. In this preliminary study, we report the qualitative and quantitative evaluation of the cutaneous microrelief in 44 healthy controls and in four patients presenting a superficial RIF, 3 to 20 years after radiotherapy for cancer. The microrelief of these RIF presented an abnormal anisotropy with a parallel reorganization of cutaneous valleys in three cases out of four, suggesting a premature radiation-induced ageing of the skin. Each subject being his own control, the relative vertical amplitude of the skin microrelief was +/- 15% in control skin. Vertical amplitude was respectively increased by 84% in one inflammatory fibrosis (3 years after RT), decreased by 18% in one evolutive fibrosis (6 years after RT), decreased by 26% in one voluminous stabilized fibrosis (8 years after BT) and decreased by 53% in one atrophic fibrosis (20 years after BT). The present study suggests that the variations of the microrelief parameters could reflect the RIF evolution. This technique requires a validation in a larger series of patients, including patients with telangiectasia.",Excluded
3331,"Increased adiponectin levels are associated with higher radiographic scores in the knee joint, but not in the hand joint Several studies have evaluated the association between serum adiponectin levels and knee and hand osteoarthritis (OA); mixed results have been reported. We investigated the relationship between OA and serum adiponectin levels according to the radiographic features of knee and hand OA. A total of 2402 subjects was recruited from the Dong-gu Study. Baseline characteristics were collected via a questionnaire, and X-rays of knee and hand joints were scored using a semi-quantitative grading system. The relationship between serum adiponectin levels and radiographic severity was evaluated by linear and logistic regression analysis. Subjects in the higher serum adiponectin levels tertiles were older and had a lower body mass index (BMI) than those in the lower tertiles. Regarding knee joint scores, serum adiponectin levels was positively associated with the total (P<0.001), osteophyte (P=0.003), and joint space narrowing (JSN) scores (P<0.001) after adjustment for age, sex, BMI, smoking, alcohol consumption, education, and physical activity. In terms of hand joint scores, no association was found between serum adiponectin levels and the total, osteophyte, JSN, subchondral cyst, sclerosis, erosion, or malalignment score after the above-mentioned adjustments. Similarly, subjects with serum adiponectin levels above the median had higher total radiographic scores in the knee joints, but not in the hand joints, after adjustment. An increased serum adiponectin levels was associated with a higher radiographic score in the knee joint, but not in the hand joint, suggesting the involvement of different pathophysiologic mechanisms in the development of OA between those joints.",Excluded
2670,"Implications of somatic mutations in the AML1 gene in radiation-associated and therapy-related myelodysplastic syndrome/acute myeloid leukemia Somatically acquired point mutations of AML1/RUNX1 gene have been recently identified in rare cases of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS). Moreover, germ line mutations of AML1 were found in an autosomal dominant disease, familial platelet disorder with predisposition to AML (FPD/AML), suggesting that AML1 mutants, as well as AML1 chimeras, contribute to the transformation of hematopoietic progenitors. In this report, we showed that AML1 point mutations were found in 6 (46%) of 13 MDS patients among atomic bomb (A-bomb) survivors in Hiroshima. Unlike acute or chronic leukemia patients among A-bomb survivors, MDS patients exposed relatively low-dose radiation and developed the disease after a long latency period. AML1 mutations also were found in 5 (38%) of 13 therapy-related AML/MDS patients who were treated with alkylating agents with or without local radiation therapy. In contrast, frequency of AML1 mutation in sporadic MDS patients was 2.7% (2 of 74). Among AML1 mutations identified in this study, truncated-type mutants lost DNA binding potential and trans-activation activity. All missense mutations with one exception (Gly42Arg) lacked DNA binding ability and down-regulated the trans-activation potential of wild-type AML1 in a dominant-negative fashion. The Gly42Arg mutation that was shared by 2 patients bound DNA even more avidly than wild-type AML1 and enhanced the trans-activation potential of normal AML1. These results suggest that AML1 point mutations are related to low-dose radiation or alkylating agents and play a role distinct from that of leukemogenic chimeras as a result of chromosomal translocations caused by sublethal radiation or topoisomerase II inhibitors.",Excluded
2898,"Endovascular Treatment of Long Superficial Femoral Artery-Chronic Total Occlusions Using the Gogo Catheter With IVUS Via a Popliteal Puncture Method Is Effective, Safe, and Useful Objectives: We aimed to investigate the usefulness of inserting a 6Fr sheath guided by duplex ultrasonography via a popliteal artery puncture. We also aimed to demonstrate endoluminal tracking using a retrograde approach using the Gogo catheter with intravascular ultrasound (IVUS). Background(s): The bidirectional approach is useful for increasing the success rate of the procedure for long superficial femoral artery-chronic total occlusions (SFA-CTOs). However, this procedure becomes somewhat complicated. Since the proximal blood vessel diameter is clearly larger than the distal end of the CTO and the body surface duplex guide can also be used in the proximal part, it is easier to introduce a retrograde guidewire (GW) into the proximal end. Method(s): We performed endovascular treatment for long SFA-CTOs with a Gogo catheter + IVUS guide in 31 consecutive cases (male 20/female 11; mean age, 75.6 +/- 7.6) from May 2017 to November 2018. We advanced the IVUS until the true lumen could be confirmed and advanced the Gogo catheter toward the IVUS for reinforcement. We attempted to approach the long CTO by repeating this procedure. We named this procedure the GIP method (GIP: Gogo catheter with IVUS via a popliteal puncture). Hemostasis of the popliteal artery was achieved using a commercially available compression hemostatic kit (Tometa-kun, XEMEX, Japan). Result(s): Successful revascularization was achieved in all cases (in 2 cases, a femoral artery puncture was added, and a bidirectional approach was used, and in 1 case, a CROSSER system was used). On average, the fluoroscopy time was 42.2 +/- 30.4 minutes, radiation dose 93.7 +/- 78.7 mGy, and amount of contrast medium used 15.0 +/- 9.6 mL. The procedure time was defined as from the start of the popliteal artery puncture to the time the GW passed through the CTO lesion, including the posture transformation time from prone to the supine position. The procedure time was 42.1 +/- 40.2 minutes. There were no major adverse events or other major complications, such as a distal embolism, rupture of the CTO lesion, arteriovenous fistula, or major hematoma requiring a transfusion or surgical treatment. Only 2 small hematomas occurred at the popliteal artery puncture site. The patients were treated conservatively and were discharged as usual. Conclusion(s): Endovascular treatment of long SFA-CTOs via the popliteal approach was effective and safe. Using the GIP method to address long SFA-CTOs is recommended.Copyright © The Author(s) 2020.",Excluded
2792,"Reducing computed tomography utilization in the evaluation of renal colic in the emergency department Study Objective: Evaluation of suspected kidney stones make up more than 1 million visits to emergency departments (ED) annually. Renal colic is frequently evaluated with the use of computed tomography (CT), the use of which has greatly increased in recent years. CT for suspected kidney stone has not been shown to improve patient outcomes but is associated with increased exposure to radiation, increased cost and increased ED length of stay. Method(s): In this project, a two-hospital community-based emergency medicine group and the local Regional Collaborative Care Organization (RCCO) began a joint project with the intent to improve the delivery of care to all patients. The goal of our project was to reduce CT imaging in the evaluation of renal colic in the ED to reduce costs, reduce exposure to radiation, and make CT imaging more available for emergent conditions. An educational program was used to support providers in the ED in reduction of total use of CT in the evaluation of patients. This included ultrasound education along with understanding of the cost, radiation exposure and use model for evaluation of suspected renal colic. A monitoring and feedback system was implemented. A care pathway was developed to help with the decisionmaking process and to facilitate a more standardized approach to care. Result(s): All patients seen and evaluated at the two sites were included in the data set. A baseline in utilization was established for all patients from 7/1/14 to 12/31/14. Education and pathways were introduced in the first half of 2015. Data was collected in the same manner for 7/1/15 to 12/31/15. The data was reviewed for individual providers as well as a department as a whole. Data is reported as a number of studies performed per 1000 patients seen for all complaints. The baseline data demonstrated utilization at site #1 at 21.60 and site #2 at 16.45 per 1000 patients. The post implementation data for site #1 is 13.01 and site #2 is 10.40 per 1000 patients. This represents areductionof 40%atsite #1 and 37% at site #2. The combinedresult of the two sites was a reduction from 17.17 to 10.94 per 1000 patients seen or a reduction of 38%. The overall reduction in the six months of data collection was from 1208 total scans to 753 or a change of 455 scans for essentially the same volume of total patients seen in the ED (68,196 base versus 68,804 after). There was a 32% decrease in variability in practice looking at the individuals from baseline to post intervention. RCCO noted a decrease in their financial burden of their patients. In review of the RCCO supported patients comparing the full 2014 year to 2015 there was a reduction in exams for their patient population from 3493 to 2111 or a difference of 1382 (40% decrease). The cost savings to RCCO was $978,602 for that same period. Conclusion(s): The patients received more consistent goal-directed evaluation and care. Patients had a decrease in radiation. The financial burden was decreased. The facility was able to utilize the CT equipment for more timely care of critical patients. The physicians received education and support that will continue to assist in their delivery of care.",Excluded
3643,"Parasympathetic stimulation improves epithelial organ regeneration Parasympathetic nerves are a vital component of the progenitor cell niche during development, maintaining a pool of progenitors for organogenesis. Injured adult organs do not regenerate after parasympathectomy, and there are few treatments to improve organ regeneration, particularly after damage by therapeutic irradiation. Here we show that restoring parasympathetic function with the neurotrophic factor neurturin increases epithelial organ regeneration after damage. We use mouse salivary gland explant culture containing fluorescently labelled progenitors, and injure the tissue with irradiation. The progenitors survive, parasympathetic function is diminished and epithelial apoptosis reduces the expression of neurturin, which increases neuronal apoptosis. Treatment with neurturin reduces neuronal apoptosis, restores parasympathetic function and increases epithelial regeneration. Furthermore, adult human salivary glands damaged by irradiation also have reduced parasympathetic innervation. We propose that neurturin will protect the parasympathetic nerves from damage and improve organ regeneration. This concept may be applicable for other organs where parasympathetic innervation influences their function.",Excluded
2970,"Low-dose computed tomography versus plain abdominal radiography in the investigation of an acute abdomen Background: To compare low-dose abdominal computed tomography (LDCT) with plain abdominal radiography (AR) in the primary investigation of acute abdominal pain to determine if there is a difference in diagnostic yield, the number of additional investigations required and hospital length of stay (LOS). Method(s): This randomized controlled trial was approved by the institutional review board, and informed consent was obtained. Patients presenting to the emergency department with an acute abdomen and who would normally be investigated with AR were randomized to either AR or LDCT. The estimated radiation dose of the LDCT protocol was 2-3mSv compared to 1.1mSv for AR. Pearson's chi-square and the independent samples t-test were used for the statistical analysis. Result(s): A total of 142 patients were eligible, and after exclusions and omitting those with incomplete data, 55 patients remained for analysis in the AR arm and 53 in the LDCT arm. A diagnosis could be obtained in 12 (21.8%) patients investigated with AR compared to 34 (64.2%) for LDCT (P < 0.001). Twenty-eight (50.9%) patients in the AR group required further imaging during their admission compared to 14 (26.4%) in the LDCT group (P= 0.009). There was no difference in the median hospital LOS (3.84 days for AR versus 4.24 days for LDCT, P= 0.83). Conclusion(s): LDCT demonstrates a superior diagnostic yield over AR and reduces the number of subsequent imaging tests for a minimal cost in radiation exposure. However, there is no difference in the overall hospital LOS between the two imaging strategies. © 2011 The Authors. ANZ Journal of Surgery © 2011 Royal Australasian College of Surgeons.",Excluded

To assess whether nimustine (ACNU), a drug that can cross the blood brain barrier, combined with radiotherapy, improved the survival of patients with primary central nervous system lymphoma (PCNSL). Clinical materials and methods. Between 1995 and 2005, we treated 63 immunocompetent PCNSL patients with combination therapy consisting of intra-arterial ACNU (100mg/m 2) and whole brain radiotherapy (36-50Gy). Their median age was 60 years (range 28-81). The median follow-up was 24 months. Findings. With this regimen we achieved a complete response rate of 75% (43 of 57 patients). Kaplan-Meier estimates for median progression-free survival and median overall survival were 26 and 39 months, respectively. The 3- and 5-year survival rates were 51% (95% confidence interval [CI], 36-65%) and 32% (95% CI, 17-47%), respectively. By multivariate analysis, age (<60 vs. >=60 years) was the only statistically significant prognostic factor; the WBRT dose, sex, and number of tumors were not significant prognostic factors in this study. Myelosuppression was the most frequent side effect, 60% of patients experienced grade 3-4 leukopenia. Late neurotoxicity as a result of treatment was observed in 14 of 43 patients (34%) and higher age (>60) was associated with a high risk of neurotoxicity. Conclusion. The intra-arterial administration of ACNU combined with radiation therapy yielded a high response rate at acceptable toxicity levels in younger patients with PCNSL. However, late neurotoxicity was a serious complication in patients above 60 years of age. © 2007 Springer-Verlag.",Excluded

Method(s): CERENAT is a multicenter case-control study carried out in four areas in France in 2004-2006. Data about mobile phone use were collected through a detailed questionnaire delivered in a face-to-face manner. Conditional logistic regression for matched sets was used to estimate adjusted ORs and 95% CIs. Result(s): A total of 253 gliomas, 194 meningiomas and 892 matched controls selected from the local electoral rolls were analysed.

2933,"Parotid-sparing intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) for nasopharyngeal carcinoma: preserved parotid function after IMRT on quantitative salivary scintigraphy, and comparison with historical data after conventional radiotherapy PURPOSE: To evaluate the parotid function after parotid-sparing intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) in patients with nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC)., METHODS AND MATERIALS: From March 2003 to May 2004, 16 patients with nonmetastatic NPC underwent parotid-sparing IMRT. Eight of these patients had Stage III or IV NPC based on the 1997 American Joint Committee on Cancer staging system. The post-IMRT parotid function was evaluated by quantitative salivary scintigraphy and represented by the maximal excretion ratio (MER) of the parotid gland after sialogogue stimulation. The parotid function of 16 NPC patients who were previously treated with conventional radiotherapy was reviewed as the historical control., RESULTS: In the parotid-sparing IMRT group, all 16 patients were alive and without cancer at the end of follow-up period (median, 24.2 months). The mean parotid MER was 53.5% before radiotherapy, 10.7% at 1 month post-IMRT, and 23.3% at 9 months post-IMRT. In the conventional radiotherapy group, the mean parotid MER was 0.6% at 6 to 12 months postradiotherapy. The difference was statistically significant (23.3% vs. 0.6%, p<0.001, Mann-Whitney test). In the IMRT group, the mean parotid doses ranged from 33.2 Gy to 58.8 Gy (average, 43.9 Gy). The correlation between the mean parotid dose and the percentage decrease of parotid MER at 9 months post-IMRT (dMER) was statically significant (p=0.008, Pearson correlation)., CONCLUSIONS: Although the mean parotid doses are relatively high, the significant preservation of parotid function is achieved with IMRT for NPC patients. The significant correlation between mean parotid dose and parotid dMER demonstrates the dose-function relationship of the parotid gland.",Excluded

2696,"Proton beam therapy versus stereotactic body radiotherapy for hepatocellular carcinoma: Practice patterns, outcomes, and the effect of biologically effective dose escalation Background: Stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) and proton beam therapy (PBT) generally are safe and effective for non-operative hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). To date, data comparing the two modalities are limited. We aimed to identify the practice patterns and outcomes of nonsurgical HCC cases treated definitively with either SBRT or PBT. Method(s): We queried the National Cancer Database for T1-2N0 HCC patients receiving PBT or SBRT from 2004 to 2015. Patients were excluded for any treatment other than non-palliative external beam radiotherapy. A multivariable binomial regression model identified patterns of SBRT/PBT use, and propensity-matched multivariable Cox regression assessed correlates of survival. Result(s): A total of 71 patients received PBT and 918 patients received SBRT (median follow-up 45 months). SBRT was used in 1.8% of nonoperative early stage HCC cases in 2004 and 4.2% of cases in 2015, whereas PBT was used in 0.1-0.2% of cases every year. The median biologically effective dose (BED) for SBRT and PBT was 100 Gy10 and 98 Gy10, respectively (OR =0.70, P=0.17). Factors predictive of receiving PBT included: white race, higher comorbidity score, higher education, metropolitan residence, tumors >5 cm and recent treatment (all P<0.05). Both PBT (HR =0.48, 95% CI: 0.29-0.78) and BED >=100 Gy10 (HR =0.61, 95% CI: 0.38-0.98) were independent predictors for longer survival. Conclusion(s): Although not implying causation and requiring prospective corroboration, PBT was independently associated with longer survival than SBRT, despite being delivered to HCC patients with multiple poor prognostic factors. PBT may also allow for safer BED escalation, which also independently associated with outcomes.Copyright © 2019 Journal of Gastrointestinal Oncology.",Excluded
2654,"Dosimetric study of intensity modulated arc therapy for total marrow irradiation Purpose/Objective(s): In recent years, helical tomotherapy has been used for total bone marrow irradiation for sparing of critical organs. In this study, we evaluated the efficacy of intensity-modulated arc therapy (IMAT) for total bone marrow irradiation. Materials/Methods: Three patients who received total marrow irradiation with helical tomotherapy, two females and one male, were selected for this dosimetric study. Each patient had one CT scan with normal breathing from the skull to the mid-thigh, and two CT scans at the end of the expiration and inspiration phases. Contours for target volumes and normal organs were drawn to take into account breathing effects. The target volumes included the bone volume from the skull to the mid-thigh, lymph nodes, and spleen. 12 Gy in 8 fractions was prescribed to the target volumes. Varian RapidArc IMAT plans were generated with the same target volumes as the helical tomotherapy plans. For each patient, 23 normal structures were included in plan optimization, including all the major organs in the body. In helical tomotherapy plans, 5 cm jaw width was used. For IMAT planning, eight arc fields were used for each patient to cover the entire target volumes, with the isocenters aligned along the superior-inferior axis. Both the helical tomotherapy and IMAT plans were normalized to cover 85% of the bone volume by 12 Gy. Result(s): The average values of themean doses to the normal organswere 6.0 Gy, 6.0 Gy, and 5.8Gy in helical tomotherapy plans for the three patients; they were 4.8 Gy, 5.4 Gy, and 5.2 Gy, respectively, in IMAT plans. Of the 63 organs that could be compared pairwise, 43 had lower means using IMATand 17 had lowermeans using tomotherapy.Of the 40 organ pairs whose mean doses differed bymore than 10%, 33 had lower means in IMAT plans.D10 (theminimumdose level covering 10%of the volume) for the bone volume were 13.5 Gy, 13.1 Gy, and 13.5 Gy in helical tomotherapy plans for the three patients, respectively; they were 13.7 Gy, 14.4Gy, and 14.3Gy in IMAT plans. Comparable dose coveragewas achieved by IMAT plans for other target volumes. The average beam-on timewas 19.4minutes for helical tomotherapy and approximately 16 minutes for IMAT. Planning time excluding contouring was approximately 4h for each method. The average monitor unit (MU) in helical tomotherapy plans was 17,207 MU; it was 4,916 MU in IMAT plans. Conclusion(s): Compared to helical tomotherapy plans, IMAT plans showed consistent improvement in sparing of normal organs while delivering a somewhat less homogeneous dose to the target volumes for total bone marrow irradiation. This study indicates that IMAT can be used effectively for total bone marrow irradiation. With either treatment lower extremities are most efficiently treated with conventional open fields.",Excluded
2625,"Selectively T cell-depleted allografts from hla-matched sibling donors followed by low-dose posttransplantation immunosuppression to improve transplantation outcome in patients with hematologic malignancies We evaluated a photodepletion technique to selectively deplete host-reacting T cells from human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-matched sibling stem cell transplantations with the goal of reducing posttransplantation immunosuppression to improve antimalignancy effects postallografting. Donor lymphocytes were stimulated with irradiated expanded recipient T lymphocytes in an ex vivo mixed lymphocyte reaction. Alloactivated T cells preferentially retaining the photosensitizer 4,5-dibromorhodamine 123 (TH9402) were eliminated by exposure to visible light. Twenty-four patients with hematologic malignancies (16 high risk) conditioned with fludarabine, cyclophosphamide, and totalbody irradiation received a CD34-selected stem cell allograft from an HLA-matched sibling along with 5 x 106/kg selectively depleted donor T cells. Low-dose cyclosporine was used for posttransplantation immunosuppression. Eleven patients survived at a median of 30 months. Probabilities (+/- SEM) for overall and disease-free survival are 39% +/- 12% and 30% +/- 12%, respectively, whereas grade III-IV acute graft-versus-host disease (aGVHD) was 13% +/- 7%. Six patients relapsed, with a relapse probability of 27% +/- 10%. These results suggest that selectively photodepleted allografts in matched sibling transplantations followed by low-dose immunosuppression may protect against severe aGVHD but is associated with delayed immune recovery. © 2011.",Excluded
3433,"Sweat gland function as a measure of radiation change BACKGROUND: Radiotherapy may result in dryness of the skin even when no other change can be detected. We describe a system for recording the electrical conductance of skin as a measure of sweat gland function., PATIENTS AND METHODS: In 22 normal volunteers close agreement was obtained between measurements obtained from comparable sites on both sides of the chest. Measurements were subsequently made in 38 patients treated by radiotherapy to one side of the chest for tumours of the breast or lung using one of five different fractionation schedules. Simultaneous readings were obtained from both sides of the chest with the non irradiated side acting as a control., RESULTS: A dose response relationship was demonstrated: five patients who received the equivalent total dose of 15 Gy in 2-Gy fractions showed no change in conductance. Sixteen out of 23 who received an equivalent total dose of 42-46 Gy in 2-Gy fractions had a greater than 22% reduction in mean skin conductance compared with that of the control areas despite the skin appearing normal in the large majority. Marked changes in skin conductance were seen after higher total doses. In a prospective study 18 women receiving breast irradiation underwent weekly readings during treatment. A mean reduction of 40% in skin conductance was noted by the end of the second week of treatment prior to any clinical evidence of radiation change. Skin conductance returned to normal in 44% of patients by 6 months. In the remainder, those patients who showed the greatest reduction in skin conductance during treatment demonstrated the least recovery., CONCLUSIONS: Changes in sweat gland function can be detected and quantified in skin which may otherwise appear normal. Differences may so be demonstrated between areas treated using different fractionation schedules and the method may be applied to the detection during radiotherapy of unusually sensitive patient.",Excluded
3377,"Determinants of vitamin D status in long-term renal transplant patients In this study, we explored the determinants of vitamin D status in a large cohort of stable, Long-term renal transplant (RTx) patients. Serum 25(OH)D concentrations, and bone biochemistry parameters, were retrospectively analyzed from 266 RTx patients (>10 yr post-engraftment) presenting to clinic over the course of a year. Forty-five percent of the cohort were vitamin D deficient (<37.5 nM), 38% insufficient (37.5 75-nM), and 17% sufficient (>75 nM). Serum 25(OH)D concentrations were higher in patients presenting in summer (p<0.001) and in more active patients (p<0.05). RTx patients with non-melanoma skin cancer (NMSC) (n=45) had higher 25(OH)D concentrations than patients without NMSC (n=221; p<0.05) despite these patients being older, having worse eGFR, transplanted for longer, and less active physically (p<0.05). Lower 25(OH)D concentrations were associated with higher PTH concentrations (p<0.05) which, in the setting of widespread hypovitaminosis, suggests that secondary hyperparathyroidism was common in this cohort. In conclusion, season and activity status are important determinants of vitamin D status. We report, for the first time, that NMSC is associated with higher 25(OH)D, probably through increased UV radiation exposure. Long-term RTx patients may benefit from oral vitamin D supplementation, but this requires a randomized controlled trial to confirm. Copyright © 2012 John Wiley & Sons A/S.",Excluded
2573,"Hormonal treatment after cytotoxic therapy stimulates recovery of spermatogenesis Previous studies have shown that treatment of rats with gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) analogues or steroids either before exposure to procarbazine or radiation or after irradiation enhances subsequent levels of spermatogenesis. We demonstrate here that giving a GnRH agonist after procarbazine injection also enhances spermatogenesis and fertility. We also demonstrate that GnRH agonist stimulated recovery of spermatogenesis and fertility not only when the hormone was administered immediately after irradiation, but also at 20 weeks after irradiation, after the decline in spermatogenesis had occurred. These results suggest that GnRH agonist treatment given to azoospermic men after cytotoxic therapy for cancer may stimulate the recovery of spermatogenesis and fertility.",Excluded
3221,"Male breast cancer: risk factors, diagnosis, and management (Review) Male breast cancer (MBC) is extremely rare, with an incidence in the general US population of <1%. It tends to be diagnosed at later stages than breast cancer in females, likely because of low awareness on the part of the patient and low suspicion by the physician. Risk factors include genetic predisposition, alterations to the estrogen-testosterone ratio, radiation exposure, and occupational hazards. Because of the rarity of MBC, mammography in men is more often utilized as a diagnostic tool to evaluate breast symptoms rather than as a tool for widespread screening. While clinical breast examinations are effective at evaluating breast symptoms, mammography also may be beneficial in separating malignant from benign breast disease. This study reviews MBC and its risk factors, recommendations for screening and diagnosis, the roles of mammography and genetic testing in surveillance, and management of patients with MBC. Heightened awareness of the increased risk in certain men by both physicians and patients, and adherence to guidelines recommended for the surveillance of men at increased risk, may result in earlier detection.",Excluded
3652,"IL-10 IS DOWN-REGULATED IN THE CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASES SUSPECTED PATIENTS, INDEPENDENT OF ANGIOGRAPHY IL-10 and interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) are the important anti and pro-inflammatory cytokines, respectively, which may participate in the cardiovascular disease pathogenesis. Additionally, environmental factors, such as the X-ray, can modulate cytokine expression. Due to the fact that X-ray is used during angiography, hence, angiography may alter expression of the cytokines., OBJECTIVE: Accordingly, this project was aimed to assess IL-10 and IFN-gamma serum levels within cardiovascular patients (with and without vessel stenosis) versus healthy controls and also the effects of angiography on the serum levels of the cytokines., MATERIAL AND METHODS: This study was performed on the 80 participants, including twenty cases in each group (healthy controls and cardiovascular patients without vessel stenosis, stenosis of 1 vessel and stenosis of more than 1 vessel) to evaluate IL-10 and IFN-gamma serum levels using ELISA technique. The IL-10 and IFN-gamma serum levels also compared within group 2, 3 and 4 before and after angiography to explore the effects of the technique on the IL-10 and IFN-gamma serum levels., RESULTS: IL-10, but not IFN-gamma, serum levels were higher in the healthy controls than all cardiovascular patients. IL-10 and IFN-gamma serum levels were not altered after angiography and also were not differ in the smoker versus non- smoker and opium consuming versus non-opium consuming participants., CONCLUSION: Due to the results it may be concluded that IL-10 can be considered as a plausible inhibitor of cardio- vascular diseases independent of angiography duration and X-ray, however, IFN-gamma has no effects in the Iranian patients suffering from cardiovascular diseases.

2590,"Combined modality therapy including intraoperative electron irradiation for locally recurrent colorectal cancer Purpose: To evaluate survival, relapse patterns, and prognostic factors in patients with colorectal cancer relapse treated with curative-intent therapy, including intraoperative electron radiation therapy (IOERT). Methods and Materials: From April 1981 through January 2008, 607 patients with recurrent colorectal cancer received IOERT as a component of treatment. IOERT was preceded or followed by external radiation (median dose, 45.5 Gy) in 583 patients (96%). Resection was classified as R0 in 227 (37%), R1 in 224 (37%), and R2 in 156 (26%). The median IOERT dose was 15 Gy (range, 7.5-30 Gy). Result(s): Median overall survival was 36 months. Five- and 10-year survival rates were 30% and 16%, respectively. Survival estimates at 5 years were 46%, 27%, and 16% for R0, R1, and R2 resection, respectively. Multivariate analysis revealed that R0 resection, no prior chemotherapy, and more recent treatment (in the second half of the series) were associated with improved survival. The 3-year cumulative incidence of central, local, and distant relapse was 12%, 23%, and 49%, respectively. Central and local relapse were more common in previously irradiated patients and in those with subtotal resection. Toxicity Grade 3 or higher partially attributable to IOERT was observed in 66 patients (11%). Neuropathy was observed in 94 patients (15%) and was more common with IOERT doses exceeding 12.5 Gy. Conclusion(s): Long-term survival and disease control was achievable in patients with locally recurrent colorectal cancer. Continued evaluation of curative-intent, combined-modality therapy that includes IOERT is warranted in this high-risk population. © 2011 Elsevier Inc. Printed in the USA.

3046,"Clinical results of intraarticular calcaneal fractures in long-term follow-up Introduction: Clinical results of Calcaneal fractures are often poor because of unsatisfactory reduction, and other problems. In this study, we assessed long-term outcomes after ORIF of intraarticular calcaneal fractures, as well as outcomes of salvage surgery performed for patients with poor outcomes. Method(s): The subjects were 11 patients who were treated with ORIF and followed up for at least 5 years after surgery and 56 patients with poor outcomes, after initial surgery performed at another hospital. Salvage procedures performed for these patients were the lift-up of joint surface (36 feet), arthrodesis (17 feet), and observation without intervention (3 feet). Clinical assessment was based on Maxfield's criteria, and imaging assessment was based on X-ray findings. The mean postoperative follow-up periods were 6. 4 years in ORIF group and 4. 2 years in the lift-up or arthrodesis group. Result(s): ORIF group were excellent for 4 feet, good: 6, fair: 0, poor:1, and osteoarthritic (OA) changes were observed in 2. Lift-up of joint group were excellent: 26, good:7, fair:3, poor:none, OA:3. Arthrodesis group were excellent:11, good:3, fair:3, poor:none. Conclusion(s): If ORIF under the satisfactory reduction is performed, long-term outcomes would be good or excellent without any OA changes. When outcomes of initial surgery are poor, they may complain of pain soon after the initial surgery and require additional salvage surgery within 3 years. Long-term outcomes for calcaneal fractures are greatly affected by satisfactory or unsatisfactory reduction.",Excluded
3507,"Imaging for appendicitis: should radiation-induced cancer risks affect modality selection? PURPOSE: To compare life expectancy (LE) losses attributable to three imaging strategies for appendicitis in adults-computed tomography (CT), ultrasonography (US) followed by CT for negative or indeterminate US results, and magnetic resonance (MR) imaging-by using a decision-analytic model., MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this model, for each imaging strategy, LE losses for 20-, 40-, and 65-year-old men and women were computed as a function of five key variables: baseline cohort LE, test performance, surgical mortality, risk of death from delayed diagnosis (missed appendicitis), and LE loss attributable to radiation-induced cancer death. Appendicitis prevalence, test performance, mortality rates from surgery and missed appendicitis, and radiation doses from CT were elicited from the published literature and institutional data. LE loss attributable to radiation exposure was projected by using a separate organ-specific model that accounted for anatomic coverage during a typical abdominopelvic CT examination. One- and two-way sensitivity analyses were performed to evaluate effects of model input variability on results., RESULTS: Outcomes across imaging strategies differed minimally-for example, for 20-year-old men, corresponding LE losses were 5.8 days (MR imaging), 6.8 days (combined US and CT), and 8.2 days (CT). This order was sensitive to differences in test performance but was insensitive to variation in radiation-induced cancer deaths. For example, in the same cohort, MR imaging sensitivity had to be 91% at minimum (if specificity were 100%), and MR imaging specificity had to be 62% at minimum (if sensitivity were 100%) to incur the least LE loss. Conversely, LE loss attributable to radiation exposure would need to decrease by 74-fold for combined US and CT, instead of MR imaging, to incur the least LE loss., CONCLUSION: The specific imaging strategy used to diagnose appendicitis minimally affects outcomes. Paradigm shifts to MR imaging owing to concerns over radiation should be considered only if MR imaging test performance is very high.",Excluded

The effect of amino acid (AA) co-infusion on renal and tumour uptake was assessed in a cross-over randomised setting. Five regimens were tested: no infusion, 4-h infusion of 120 g mixed AA (26.4 g l-lysine + l-arginine), 4 h l-lysine (50 g), 10 h 240 g mixed AA (52.8 g l-lysine + l-arginine) and 4 h Lys-Arg (25 g each). Comparisons were performed on an intra-patient basis. Infusions of AA started 0.5 h prior to injection of (86)Y-SMT487 and PET scans were obtained at 4, 24 and 48 h p.i. Absorbed doses to tissues were computed using the MIRD3 method. (86)Y-SMT487 displayed rapid plasma clearance and exclusive renal excretion; uptake was noted in kidneys, tumours, spleen and, to a lesser extent, liver. The 4-h mixed AA co-infusion significantly ( P<0.05) reduced (86)Y-SMT487 renal uptake by a mean of 21%. This protective effect was significant on the dosimetry data (3.3+/-1.3 vs 4.4+/-1.0 mGy/MBq; P<0.05) and was further enhanced upon prolonging the infusion to 10 h (2.1+/-0.4 vs 1.7+/-0.2 mGy/MBq; P<0.05). Infusion of Lys-Arg but not of l-lysine was more effective in reducing renal uptake than mixed AA. Infusion of AA did not result in reduced tumour uptake. The amount of (90)Y-SMT487 (maximum allowed dose: MAD) that would result in a 23-Gy cut-off dose to kidneys was calculated for each study: MAD was higher with mixed AA co-infusion by a mean of 46% (10-114%, P<0.05 vs no infusion). In comparison with 4 h mixed AA, the MAD was higher by a mean of 23% (9-37%; P<0.05) with prolonged infusion and by a mean of 16% (2-28%; P<0.05) with Lys-Arg. We conclude that infusion of large amounts of AA reduces renal exposure during peptide-based radiotherapy and allows higher absorbed doses to tumours. The prolongation of the infusion from 4 to 10 h further enhances the protective effect on the kidneys.",Excluded
3375,"Effect of intraocular scattering in macular pigment optical density measurements Fundus reflectometry is a common in-vivo, noninvasive method to estimate the macular pigment optical density (MPOD). The measured density, however, can be affected by the individual's intraocular scattering. Scattering causes a reduction in the contrast of the fundus image, which in turn leads to an underestimation of the measured density. Intraocular scattering was measured optically in a group of seven young, healthy subjects using the method of optical integration and was subsequently used to correctly estimate the MPOD from fundus images. It was shown that when scattering is not considered, the measured optical density using fundus reflectometry can be underestimated by as high as 16% for our group of subjects.Copyright (2018) COPYRIGHT Society of Photo-Optical Instrumentation Engineers (SPIE).",Excluded

Material(s) and Method(s): Medical records of 60 patients with NSCLC who received definitive CCRT were retrospectively reviewed. Dose volumetric (DV) parameters, clinical factors, and pulmonary function test (PFT) data were analyzed. RP was graded according to the CTCAE ver. 4.0. Percentage of lung volume that received a dose of threshold (Vdose) and mean lung dose (MLD) were analyzed for potential DV predictors. PFT changes were calculated as the difference between pre-RT and post-RT values at 3, 6, and 12 months after RT. Result(s): Twenty-two patients (37%) developed grade >=2 RP. Among clinical factors, tumor location in lower lobe was associated with RP. Among the DV parameters, only MLD >15 Gy was associated with grade >=2 RP. There were statistically significant decreases in PFT at all points compared with pre-RT values in grade >=2 RP group. MLD was associated with forced vital capacity (FVC) and forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) changes at 6 and 12 months. V10 was associated with FVC changes at 12 months. V20 and V30 were associated with FEV1 changes at 6 months and FVC changes at 12 months. Conclusion(s): After definitive CCRT in patients with NSCLC, MLD >15 Gy and lower lobe tumor location were predictors of grade >=2 RP.

In 12 rats, 3D AR visualization of preprocedural MR images was performed before embolization. Procedural metrics including catheterization time and radiation exposure were compared vs a prospective cohort of 16 rats in which embolization was performed without AR. An additional cohort of 15 retrospective cases was identified and combined with the prospective control cohort (n = 31) to improve statistical power., RESULTS: A 37% reduction in fluoroscopy time, from 11.7 min to 7.4 minutes, was observed with AR when compared prospectively, which did not reach statistical significance (P = .12); however, when compared with combined prospective and retrospective controls, the reduction in fluoroscopy time from 14.1 min to 7.4 minutes (48%) was significant (P = .01). A 27% reduction in total catheterization time, from 42.7 minutes to 31.0 minutes, was also observed with AR when compared prospectively, which did not reach statistical significance (P = .11). No significant differences were seen in dose-area product or air kerma prospectively., CONCLUSIONS: Three-dimensional AR visualization of preprocedural imaging may aid in the reduction of procedural metrics in a preclinical model of transarterial embolization.

This study aims to evaluate their association with arthritis features and hand MRI abnormalities in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). METHOD(S): Fifty SLE patients, with a mean (SD) age of 48.1 (14.6) years were tested for MMP-3 and MMP-12 serum levels, then further classified according to the presence of X-Ray erosions and joint deformities. Eighteen rheumatoid arthritis patients aged 47.9 (11.8) and 14 healthy people aged 46.0 (11.0) were enrolled as control groups. A subgroup of 28 SLE patients underwent a dominant-hand MRI; the detected changes were classified and semiquantitatively scored as capsular swelling, synovitis, edematous or proliferative tenosynovitis, bone oedema, bone erosions. Statistical analysis was performed using multiple regression models. RESULT(S): MMP-3 were significantly higher in patients with Jaccoud's arthropathy (JA) (22.1ng/ml, p< 0.05) and independently associated with hsCRP serum levels (B-coeff 0.50; r=0.30; p< 0.05). MMP-12 serum levels were significantly lower in patients with JA (0.18ng/ml, p< 0.05) and inversely associated with the prednisone daily dose (B-coeff -0.03; r= -0.44; p< 0.01).

The aim was to retrospectively investigate correlations between potential predictive parameters and the occurrence of radiation-induced lung injury in patients with primary or secondary lung tumours treated with stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT). Sixty patients (63 tumours) underwent SBRT, with a dose of 45 Gy in 3 fractions over 5 days or 26 Gy in single fraction. The following parameters were tested for correlation with Radiation Therapy Oncology Group (RTOG) lung toxicity score: planning target volume (PTV), tumour location, primary vs. metastatic tumour, and Mean Lung Dose (in 2 Gy fractions, MLD2). Normal Tissue Complication Probability (NTCP) values were then estimated. Results. The median follow-up time was 30.9 months (range 6.756.7). RTOG grade 01 toxicity was observed in 54/63 (85.7%) and grade 23 in 9/63 (14.3%) cases. Mean values of MLD2 for RTOG grade 01 and 23 were respectively 11.2 Gy (95% Confidence Interval (CI) 10.112.3 Gy) and 20.3 Gy (95% CI 16.623.9 Gy). NTCP mean values for RTOG grade 01 and 23 were respectively 4% (95% CI 25.9%) and 37% (95% CI 11.662.3%). Univariate analysis, performed with t-Student test, showed a statistically significant difference between MLD2 values in the two groups (t = 5.93 and p <= 0.001). Logistic regression analysis showed a good correlation between MLD2 and toxicity scores 23 (p = 0.008, odds ratio 1.5). From logistic regression relationship between the observed rates of grade 23 and MLD2, a D50=19.8 Gy and a 50=2.2 were obtained. From the sigmoid-shaped dose-response relationship between NTCP and MLD2, a D50=22.4 Gy and 50=2.2 were derived. Discussion. MLD2 is strongly associated to the risk of lung injury. Higher NTCP values are associated with a higher risk, but when comparing the expected to the observed toxicity rate, NTCP seems to underestimate the risk.",Excluded
2778,"Minimal erythema dose after multiple UV exposures depends on pre-exposure skin pigmentation BACKGROUND/PURPOSE: Phototherapy consists of multiple ultraviolet (UV) exposures. Most previous studies have focused on erythema following a single UV exposure in fair-skinned persons. Although it is well known that phototherapy lowers the daily UV-threshold dose for erythema in clinical practice, this is insufficiently documented under controlled experimental conditions. The purpose of this study was to quantify the change in the daily threshold for a dose specific erythema grade after 1-4 consecutive daily UV exposures., METHODS: Forty-nine healthy volunteers (skin type II-V) with varying pigmentation quantified by skin reflectance. Two UV sources were used: a narrowband UVB (Philips TL01) and a Solar Simulator (Solar Light Co.). Just perceptible erythema after 24 h was chosen as the minimal erythema dose (+); besides + and ++ were assessed., RESULTS: We found a positive and significant exponential relationship between skin pigmentation and UV dose to elicit a specific erythema grade on the back after 1-4 UV exposures. After repetitive UV exposures the UV dose had to be lowered more in dark-skinned persons compared with fair-skinned persons to elicit a certain erythema grade. This applied to both UV sources and all erythema grades., CONCLUSION: In the dark-skinned persons the daily UV dose after the 4 days UV exposure should be lowered by 40-50% to avoid burns compared with the single UV exposure. For the most fair-skinned persons essentially no reduction in the daily UV dose was needed. Our results indicate that the pre-exposure pigmentation level can guide the UV dosage in phototherapy.",Excluded
3125,"Eye lens radiation exposure to interventional cardiologists: A retrospective assessment of cumulative doses Radiation dose to the eye lens is a crucial issue for interventional cardiologists (ICs) who are exposed during the procedures they perform. This paper presents a retrospective assessment of the cumulative eye lens doses of ICs enrolled in the O'CLOC study for Occupational Cataracts and Lens Opacities in interventional Cardiology. Information on the workload in the catheterisation laboratory, radiation protection equipment, eye lens dose per procedure and dose reduction factors associated with eye-protective equipment were considered. For the 129 ICs at an average age of 51 who had worked for an average period of 22 years, the estimated cumulative eye lens dose ranged from 25 mSv to more than 1600 mSv; the mean+SD was 423+359 mSv. After several years of practice, without eye protection, ICs may exceed the new ICRP lifetime eye dose threshold of 500 mSv and be at high risk of developing early radiation-induced cataracts. Radiation protection equipment can reduce these doses and should be used routinely. © The Author 2012. Published by Oxford University Press. All rights reserved.",Excluded
2971,"Assessment of ureteric colic in irish emergency departments-how do we compare with the gold standard? Ureteric colic describes the spasmodic pain that arises from obstruction of the ureter by a calculus. It is a common presentation in the Emergency Department (ED) with a lifetime risk of 12 % in men and 5 % in women with an incidence of 3/1000 population per year [1]. Prompt assessment and diagnosis is important as infection in the presence of obstruction is a surgical emergency. The aim of this study is to ascertain the work-up of ureteric colic in Irish EDs and compare these to the agreed gold-standard. An electronic survey was distributed to Consultants and Specialist Registrars in Emergency Medicine. Hospital demographics and presence of a urology service within the hospital were also recorded. Out of 63 responses, 66 % were Consultants and 27.4 % were Specialist Registrars in Emergency Medicine. All HSE training networks were represented. 62.9 % had established guidelines for ureteric colic in their ED. While FBC, U&E, and urine dipstick were routinely performed, metabolic profile and mid-stream urine was only performed 31 and 39 % of the time, respectively. 88.5 % of physicians agree that CT KUB should be the first-line imaging however, only 65 % of EDs actually do this, with X-ray KUB representing 36.5 % of initial imaging. The recommended analgesic-NSAIDs, are prescribed 61.9 % versus morphine, 69.8 % of the time. This is the first study to assess the work-up of ureteric colic in Irish EDs and is important in that it may change Emergency Physician behavior before Urological opinion is sought. Despite the presence of evidence-based guidelines, heterogeneity exists in care pathways used in Irish hospitals.",Excluded
2209,"Up-regulation of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma in radiation-induced heart injury in rats To explore the expression level and the role of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPAR-gamma) in radiation-induced heart injury in a rat model, thirty-two Sprague-Dawley rats were divided into three groups (the control group, the 15-Gy irradiation group and the 18-Gy irradiation group). Experimental animals were exposed to radiation generated by a linear accelerator at the chest and killed after 3 months. Heart tissues from these animals were removed for Masson staining, PPAR-gamma immunohistochemical staining, Western blot analysis and real-time polymerase chain reaction assay (RT-PCR). In addition, the protein expression of matrix metalloprotein-1 (MMP-1), tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase-1 (TIMP-1) and transforming growth factor type beta1 (TGF-beta1), all of which are associated with fibrosis, was measured. Masson staining revealed significant myocardial fibrosis, degeneration and necrosis in rats exposed to radiation. The results of immunohistochemical staining and Western blot analysis showed that PPAR-gamma protein expression in hearts of the irradiation groups was significantly higher than in the control group, especially in myocardium and vascular endothelial (p < 0.05). RT-PCR results also showed a parallel increase in PPAR-gamma mRNA expression in the heart of the irradiation groups compared with the control group (p < 0.05). The expression of MMP-1 protein was not significantly different in three groups (p > 0.05). The expression of TIMP-1 and TGF-beta1 proteins was, however, higher in two irradiation groups than in the control group (p < 0.05). These data demonstrate that PPAR-gamma expression is up-regulated on both mRNA and protein levels in heart injured by radiation. PPAR-gamma may play an important role in radiation-induced heart injury.",Included
2861,"Associations between urologist financial incentives and imaging use INTRODUCTION AND OBJECTIVES: Diagnostic imaging use has risen over the last decade contributing to health care costs, as well as patient exposure to ionizing radiation. While studies have examined the role of patient factors in these imaging trends, little is known about how physician financial incentives influence imaging use. Motivated by this, we investigated associations between urologists' imaging use and factors on which their compensation is based. METHOD(S): We analyzed data from the National Ambulatory Medical Care Survey. Through specialty codes, we identified those visits to urology clinics. Using explicit codes from the patient record form, we determined the proportion of urology visits at which imaging was ordered. During their induction interview, participating providers indicate if they are full-or part-owners, employees or independent contractors at the office location where they see the most ambulatory patients. Physicians are also asked if their clinical productivity, patient satisfaction or quality of care is taken into account for their compensation (e.g., bonuses). We performed multivariable regression to determine if a patient's receipt of imaging was associated with these financial incentives. RESULT(S): Between 2006 and 2007, over 37 million outpatient visits were made to urologists, during 22.4% (95% CI, 19.0-26.2%) of which imaging was ordered. Imaging was ordered at 24.2% (95% CI, 20.8 - 28.1%) of visits to owners, compared to 13.2% (95% CI, 9.2 - 18.6%) of visits to nonowners (P<0.001). Imaging was ordered at a higher proportion of visits to urologists with clinical productivity incentives vs. those without (27.3% [95% CI, 22.4 - 32.7%] vs. 20.8% [95% CI, 16.8 - 25.4%], P=0.049). The odds of having an imaging study ordered were 2-fold greater at an owner's office (p = 0.001). Visits to urologists with productivity incentives had a 43% higher odds of imaging (p = 0.05). These associations persisted after adjusting for patient characteristics (age, sex, race, comorbidity, urban/rural residence) and geographic region (Table). No association was found for financial incentives related to patient satisfaction or clinical quality. CONCLUSION(S): Independent of patient characteristics, imaging use at ambulatory urology visits is associated with provider financial incentives. (Table Presented).",Excluded
2848,"Constraining the brachial plexus does not compromise regional control in oropharyngeal carcinoma BACKGROUND: Accumulating evidence suggests that brachial plexopathy following head and neck cancer radiotherapy may be underreported and that this toxicity is associated with a dose-response. Our purpose was to determine whether the dose to the brachial plexus (BP) can be constrained, without compromising regional control., METHODS: The radiation plans of 324 patients with oropharyngeal carcinoma (OPC) treated with intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) were reviewed. We identified 42 patients (13%) with gross nodal disease <1 cm from the BP. Normal tissue constraints included a maximum dose of 66 Gy and a D05 of 60 Gy for the BP. These criteria took precedence over planning target volume (PTV) coverage of nodal disease near the BP., RESULTS: There was only one regional failure in the vicinity of the BP, salvaged with neck dissection (ND) and regional re-irradiation. There have been no reported episodes of brachial plexopathy to date., CONCLUSIONS: In combined-modality therapy, including ND as salvage, regional control did not appear to be compromised by constraining the dose to the BP. This approach may improve the therapeutic ratio by reducing the long-term risk of brachial plexopathy.",Excluded
3543,"Fractures of the sacrum after chemoradiation for rectal carcinoma: Incidence, risk factors, and radiographic evaluation Purpose: Sacral insufficiency fractures after adjuvant radiation for rectal carcinoma can present similarly to recurrent disease. As a complication associated with pelvic radiation, it is important to be aware of the incidence and risk factors associated with sacral fractures in the clinical assessment of these patients. Methods and Materials: Between 1998 and 2007, a total of 582 patients with locally advanced rectal carcinoma received adjuvant chemoradiation and surgical excision. Of these, 492 patients had imaging studies available for review. Hospital records and imaging studies from all 492 patients were retrospectively evaluated to identify risk factors associated with developing a sacral insufficiency fracture. Result(s): With a median follow-up time of 3.5 years, the incidence of sacral fractures was 7.1% (35/492). The 4-year sacral fracture free rate was 0.91. Univariate analysis showed that increasing age (>=60 vs. <60 years), female sex, and history of osteoporosis were significantly associated with shorter time to sacral fracture (P=.01, P=.004, P=.001, respectively). There was no significant difference in the time to sacral fracture for patients based on stage, radiotherapy dose, or chemotherapy regimen. Multivariate analysis showed increasing age (>=60 vs. <60 years, hazard ratio [HR] = 2.50, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.22-5.13, P=.01), female sex (HR = 2.64, CI = 1.29-5.38, P=.008), and history of osteoporosis (HR = 3.23, CI = 1.23-8.50, P=.02) were independent risk factors associated with sacral fracture. Conclusion(s): Sacral insufficiency fractures after pelvic radiation for rectal carcinoma occur more commonly than previously described. Independent risk factors associated with fracture were osteoporosis, female sex, and age greater than 60 years. © 2012 Elsevier Inc.",Excluded
2804,"Palliative radiotherapy with electrons of appendicular osteosarcoma in 54 dogs Radiotherapy is effective for the palliation of pain associated with primary and metastatic bony neoplasia in dogs and humans, but no standard treatment protocol has been established. The goal of this study was to evaluate a 3 x 8 Gy and a 4 x 6 Gy protocol using electrons with a betatron or linear accelerator for the treatment of appendicular osteosarcoma in 54 dogs. Thirty-three dogs received chemotherapy consisting of carboplatin IV concurrently with radiotherapy. Eighty-three % (n = 45) of the dogs experienced pain relief during or following treatment. The median duration of pain relief from treatment start was 53 days. In conclusion, both protocols are effective for palliation of clinical signs of canine appendicular osteosarcoma. The outcome reported here is similar to the results of other studies using Co photons. The use of chemotherapy did not improve the response to radiotherapy.",Excluded
2754,"Feasibility and potential utility of multicomponent exhaled breath analysis for predicting development of radiation pneumonitis after stereotactic ablative radiotherapy INTRODUCTION: In this prospective pilot study, we evaluated the feasibility and potential utility of measuring multiple exhaled gases as biomarkers of radiation pneumonitis (RP) in patients receiving stereotactic ablative radiotherapy (SABR) for lung tumors., METHODS: Breath analysis was performed for 26 patients receiving SABR for lung tumors. Concentrations of exhaled nitric oxide (eNO), carbon monoxide (eCO), nitrous oxide (eN2O), and carbon dioxide (eCO2) were measured before and immediately after each fraction using real-time, infrared laser spectroscopy. RP development (CTCAE grade >=2) was correlated with baseline gas concentrations, acute changes in gas concentrations after each SABR fraction, and dosimetric parameters., RESULTS: Exhaled breath analysis was successfully completed in 77% of patients. Five of 20 evaluable patients developed RP at a mean of 5.4 months after SABR. Acute changes in eNO and eCO concentrations, defined as percent changes between each pre-fraction and post-fraction measurement, were significantly smaller in RP versus non-RP cases (p = 0.022 and 0.015, respectively). In an exploratory analysis, a combined predictor of baseline eNO greater than 24 parts per billion and acute decrease in eCO less than 5.5% strongly correlated with RP incidence (p =0.0099). Neither eN2O nor eCO2 concentrations were significantly associated with RP development. Although generally higher in patients destined to develop RP, dosimetric parameters were not significantly associated with RP development., CONCLUSIONS: The majority of SABR patients in this pilot study were able to complete exhaled breath analysis. Baseline concentrations and acute changes in concentrations of exhaled breath components were associated with RP development after SABR. If our findings are validated, exhaled breath analysis may become a useful approach for noninvasive identification of patients at highest risk for developing RP after SABR.",Excluded
2627,"Influence of diabetes on the interpretation of PET scans in patients with esophageal cancer Purpose: Patients with diabetes mellitus (DM) can have altered sugar transport into cells, potentially affecting the results of 18-FDG PET scans. The specific aim of this study was to determine the effect of DM on pre- and post treatment standard uptake value (SUV) scores in patients undergoing chemo-radiotherapy for esophageal cancer. Method(s): Patients with locally advanced esophageal carcinoma undergoing preoperative or definitive chemoradiotherapy underwent pre-and post treatment 18-FDG PET scans. Maximum SUV score was measured from the tumor before chemoradiotherapy and 3 to 4 weeks after chemoradiotherapy (preoperatively). Patients were identified as having DM by medical record review. Random serum glucose measurements were obtained prior to 18-FDG PET scans. The Wilcoxon signed-rank test was used to test for differences in SUV scores between patients with and without DM, and a generalized linear model with backward selection was applied to search for significant predictors of initial and post treatment SUV scores. Result(s): Sixty-three patients underwent 18-FDG PET scans during the course of treatment for esophageal malignancies between 6/02 and 8/05. Fifty-four patients received chemotherapy. The median radiation dose was 46.8 Gy. Eighteen patients had DM, six were insulin-dependent DM (IDDM). There was no difference in initial SUV scores between DM and non-DM patients (P >.05). There was also no difference in initial SUV scores between IDDM and non-IDDM groups. Patients with tumors at the gastroesophageal junction had lower initial SUV scores compared to patients with tumors in the lower or midesophagus(P =.05). T stage was associated with initial SUV score (T2 lower than T3, P =.014). Older age (P =.03), diabetes (P =.007), higher T stage (P =.002), and presence of nodes (P =.05) were each positively associated with post treatment SUV scores. Blood glucose levels prior to 18-FDG PET scan, endoscopic tumor length, and tumor location were not predictive of post treatment SUV scores. Patients with DM had significantly lower post treatment SUV scores compared to patients without DM (P =.04). Pathologic complete response or percent SUV decrease did not differ between patients with or without DM. Conclusion(s): Regardless of glucose levels, DM and IDDM do not influence pretreatment SUV scores in patients with localized esophageal cancer. However, DM may influence post treatment SUV scores and thus complicate interpretation of treatment response. Further confirmatory study in a larger cohort of DM patients to evaluate the relationship of post treatment SUV score to pathologic response is warranted. © 2009 by International Society of Gastrointestinal Oncology.",Excluded
2523,"A clinical and proteomics approach to predict the presence of obstructive peripheral arterial disease: From the Catheter Sampled Blood Archive in Cardiovascular Diseases (CASABLANCA) Study BACKGROUND: Peripheral arterial disease (PAD) is a global health problem that is frequently underdiagnosed and undertreated. Noninvasive tools to predict the presence and severity of PAD have limitations including inaccuracy, cost, or need for intravenous contrast and ionizing radiation., HYPOTHESIS: A clinical/biomarker score may offer an attractive alternative diagnostic method for PAD., METHODS: In a prospective cohort of 354 patients referred for diagnostic peripheral and/or coronary angiography, predictors of >=50% stenosis in >=1 peripheral vessel (carotid/subclavian, renal, or lower extremity arteries) were identified from >50 clinical variables and 109 biomarkers. Machine learning identified variables predictive of obstructive PAD; a score derived from the final model was developed., RESULTS: The score consisted of 1 clinical variable (history of hypertension) and 6 biomarkers (midkine, kidney injury molecule-1, interleukin-23, follicle-stimulating hormone, angiopoietin-1, and eotaxin-1). The model had an in-sample area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.85 for obstructive PAD and a cross-validated area under the curve of 0.84; higher scores were associated with greater severity of angiographic stenosis. At optimal cutoff, the score had 65% sensitivity, 88% specificity, 76% positive predictive value (PPV), and 81% negative predictive value (NPV) for obstructive PAD and performed consistently across vascular territories. Partitioning the score into 5 levels resulted in a PPV of 86% and NPV of 98% in the highest and lowest levels, respectively. Elevated score was associated with shorter time to revascularization during 4.3 years of follow-up., CONCLUSIONS: A clinical/biomarker score demonstrates high accuracy for predicting the presence of PAD.

3064,"Results of adjuvant radiochemotherapy for gastric adenocarcinoma in Slovenia Aims: To analyze the results of postoperative concomitant radiochemotherapy with 5-florouracil (5-FU) and leucovorin (LV) in patients with gastric carcinoma treated in a single institution. Method(s): During 2001-2004, 123 patients with the mean age of 60 years, were treated for adenocarcinoma of the stomach, stage Ib-IV, with postoperative concomitant radiochemotherapy. Radical (R0) and non-radical (R1) resection of the tumor was performed in 107 and 16 patients, respectively. Adjuvant treatment consisted of five cycles of five-day chemotherapy with 5-FU (425 mg/m2) and LV (20 mg/m2) and concomitant radiotherapy with the total dose of 45 Gy. Result(s): The treatment was completed according to the protocol in 101 patients. Stomatitis, dysphagia, and nausea and vomiting of grade three occurred in 32, 27, and 23 patients, respectively. The median follow-up time of 87 survivors was 30.4 months (range 17.4-58.3 months). At two years, locoregional control (LRC), disease-free survival (DFS), disease-specific survival (DSS) and overall survival (OS) rates were 86%, 65%, 74%, and 73%, respectively. In the multivariate analysis, the initial Hb level was identified as independent prognostic factor for all survival four endpoints, the involvement of whole stomach with cancer for LRC, the total dose of 5-FU per five-day cycle for DFS, and pT stage for DSS. Conclusion(s): In operable gastric carcinoma, postoperative concomitant radiochemotherapy with 5-FU and LV is feasible and its toxicity acceptable. Its potential to improve the treatment outcome compared to the surgery alone is yet to be tested in well designed prospective randomized studies. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",Excluded
3455,"Medically inoperable peripheral lung cancer treated with stereotactic body radiation therapy BACKGROUND: Lung cancer is the most frequent cause of cancer-related death in North America. There is wide variation between patients who are medically inoperable and those managed surgically. The use of stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) has narrowed the gap in survival rates between operative and non-operative management for those with early stage disease. This retrospective study reports outcomes for the treatment of peripheral non-small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC) with SBRT from a single community practice., METHODS: Sixty-seven consecutive patients (pts) with inoperable, untreated peripheral lung tumors were treated from 2010 through 2012 and included in this study. Stereotactic targeting was facilitated by either spine or lung-based image guidance, either with or without fiducial marker tracking with a frameless robotic radiosurgery system. Peripheral tumors received a median biological effective dose (BED) of 105.6 Gy10 or in terms of a median physical dose, 48 Gy delivered over 4 daily fractions. Survival was measured using the Kaplan-Meier method to determine rates of local control, progression of disease and overall survival. The Cox proportional hazards regression model was used to study the effects of tumor size, stage, histology, patient age, tumor location (lobe), tracking method, and BED on the survival distributions., RESULTS: The median follow-up for this cohort was 24.5 months (range: 2.4-50.3) with an overall (OS) 3-year survival of 62.4 % (95 % CI: 74.3-47.3). The median progression-free survival was 28.5 months (95 % CI: 15.8 months to not reached). Local control (LC), defined as a lack of FDG uptake on PET/CT or the absence of tumor growth was achieved in 60 patients (90.9 %) at the time of first follow-up (median 3 months, range: 1-6). Local control at one year for the entire cohort was 81.8 % (95 % CI, 67.3-90.3). The one-year OS probability among those who achieved local control at first follow-up was 86.2 % (95 % CI, 74.3-92.9) but no patients who did not achieve LC at first follow-up survived one year. Of the 60 pts that achieved initial LC, 16 have died. The rates of local control, progression-free survival and overall survival were not statistically different for patients treated using a fiducial target tracking system versus non-invasive guidance. (p = 0.44, p = 0.97 and p = 0.66, respectively). No National Cancer Institute (NCI) Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE-4) grade 3 or greater toxicity was observed., CONCLUSION: SBRT is an effective treatment for medically inoperable NSCLC patients with peripherally located tumors. This therapy appears to be well tolerated with low toxicity, and patient outcomes when using non-invasive tumor tracking systems are not inferior to traditional fiducial-based techniques.",Excluded
3023,"Hearing Assessment after Treatment of Nasopharyngeal Carcinoma with CRT and IMRT Techniques OBJECTIVES: This study analyzed the long-term hearing loss after treatment of primary nasopharyngeal carcinoma to elucidate its causal factors., METHODS: Ninety-two nasopharyngeal carcinoma patients were treated with radiotherapy or chemoradiotherapy. Pure tone audiometry was performed before the therapy and annually up to 9 years after completing treatment. The hearing thresholds were corrected for age-related deterioration and compared to the results without adjusting for age., RESULTS: The mean air and bone conduction threshold with and without correction for age-related deterioration differed significantly 2-9 years after completing radiotherapy (p < 0.05). The audiometry results with age correction showed a flattened configuration compared to the results without age correction. The total radiation dose and radiation modality showed a causal relationship with a greater incidence of hearing loss after therapy (p < 0.05). There was more deterioration in the air and bone hearing thresholds with conformal radiotherapy than intensity-modulated radiotherapy (p < 0.001). A radiation dose >72 cGy resulted in more severe hearing loss than <72 cGy (p < 0.05)., CONCLUSION: Hearing loss after completing therapy should be corrected for age-related hearing deterioration to reveal the true extent to which the loss is a therapeutic complication. Both the radiation modality used and the dose were significantly associated with hearing loss.",Excluded
2912,"Comparison of I-131 radioimmunotherapy tumor dosimetry: Unit density sphere model versus patient-specific monte carlo calculations High computational requirements restrict the use of Monte Carlo algorithms for dose estimation in a clinical setting, despite the fact that they are considered more accurate than traditional methods. The goal of this study was to compare mean tumor absorbed dose estimates using the unit density sphere model incorporated in OLINDA with previously reported dose estimates from Monte Carlo simulations using the dose planning method (DPMMC) particle transport algorithm. The dataset (57 tumors, 19 lymphoma patients who underwent SPECT/CT imaging during I-131 radioimmunotherapy) included tumors of varying size, shape, and contrast. OLINDA calculations were first carried out using the baseline tumor volume and residence time from SPECT/CT imaging during 6 days post-tracer and 8 days post-therapy. Next, the OLINDA calculation was split over multiple time periods and summed to get the total dose, which accounted for the changes in tumor size. Results from the second calculation were compared with results determined by coupling SPECT/CT images with DPM Monte Carlo algorithms. Results from the OLINDA calculation accounting for changes in tumor size were almost always higher (median 22%, range-1%-68%) than the results from OLINDA using the baseline tumor volume because of tumor shrinkage. There was good agreement (median-5%, range-13%-2%) between the OLINDA results and the self-dose component from Monte Carlo calculations, indicating that tumor shape effects are a minor source of error when using the sphere model. However, because the sphere model ignores cross-irradiation, the OLINDA calculation significantly underestimated (median 14%, range 2%-31%) the total tumor absorbed dose compared with Monte Carlo. These results show that when the quantity of interest is the mean tumor absorbed dose, the unit density sphere model is a practical alternative to Monte Carlo for some applications. For applications requiring higher accuracy, computer-intensive Monte Carlo calculation is needed. © 2011, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.",Excluded

Materials and Methods The institutional review board approved this study, and written informed consent was obtained from each patient. Standard- and reduced-dose chest CT (60 and 250 mA) and MR imaging with UTE were used to examine 52 patients; 29 were men (mean age, 66.4 years +/- 7.3 [standard deviation]; age range, 48-79 years) and 23 were women (mean age, 64.8 years +/- 10.1; age range, 42-83 years). Probability of nodule presence was assessed for all methods with a five-point visual scoring system. All nodules were then classified as missed, ground-glass, part-solid, or solid nodules. To compare nodule detection capability of the three methods, consensus for performances was rated by using jackknife free-response receiver operating characteristic analysis, and kappa analysis was used to compare intermethod agreement for nodule type classification. Results There was no significant difference (F = 0.70, P = .59) in figure of merit between methods (standard-dose CT, 0.86; reduced-dose CT, 0.84; MR imaging with UTE, 0.86). There was no significant difference in sensitivity between methods (standard-dose CT vs reduced-dose CT, P = .50; standard-dose CT vs MR imaging with UTE, P = .50; reduced-dose CT vs MR imaging with UTE, P >.99). Intermethod agreement was excellent (standard-dose CT vs reduced-dose CT, kappa = 0.98, P < .001; standard-dose CT vs MR imaging with UTE, kappa = 0.98, P < .001; reduced-dose CT vs MR imaging with UTE, kappa = 0.99, P < .001). Conclusion Pulmonary thin-section MR imaging with UTE was useful in nodule detection and evaluation of nodule type, and it is considered at least as efficacious as standard- or reduced-dose thin-section CT. © RSNA, 2017 Online supplemental material is available for this article.",Excluded

The aim of this study is to compare prospectively in a single, high-volume center the outcome of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation ablation performed specifically by second-generation cryoballoon or contact force radiofrequency ablation., METHODS: Consecutive patients scheduled for paroxysmal atrial fibrillation transcatheter ablation have been included and prospectively followed up. Aiming to reduce potential bias deriving from baseline characteristics, a propensity score matching analysis has been performed to analyze safety and efficacy outcomes., RESULTS: Out of consecutive patients undergoing atrial fibrillation transcatheter ablation between January 2015 and December 2016, 46 patients approached by cryoablation were matched 1 : 1 by propensity score to a similar population treated by last-generation radiofrequency ablation. Freedom from atrial fibrillation after 12 months (76 vs. 78%, P = 0.804) and incidence of complications (4 vs. 6%, P = 0.168) did not differ between the two groups. Radiological exposure was higher for the cryoballoon group (11 vs. 4 min, P < 0.001), whereas procedural duration did not differ (P = 0.174). Aiming to assess the potential impact of a learning curve in patients undergoing cryoablation, the first-third of patients (n = 15) were compared with the remaining, reporting longer radiological exposure (P < 0.001), but similar safety and efficacy., CONCLUSION: In this propensity score analysis, last-generation cryoballoon and radiofrequency catheters for atrial fibrillation ablation present similar efficacy and safety.

Material(s) and Method(s): Eighty-three patients who had undergone CT venography of the lower extremities with MBIR at 80 kVp (Group A; 21 men and 20 women; mean age, 55.5 years) or ASIR-V at 70 kVp (Group B; 18 men and 24 women; mean age, 57.3 years) were enrolled. Two radiologists retrospectively evaluated the objective (vascular enhancement, image noise, signal-to-noise ratio [SNR], contrast-to-noise ratio [CNR]) and subjective (quantum mottle, delineation of contour, venous enhancement) image quality indicators at the inferior vena cava and femoral and popliteal veins. Clinical information, radiation dose, reconstruction time, and objective and subjective image quality indicators were compared between groups A and B. Result(s): Vascular enhancement, SNR, and CNR were significantly greater in Group B than in Group A (p <= 0.015). Image noise was significantly lower in Group B (p <= 0.021), and all subjective image quality indicators, except for delineation of vein contours, were significantly better in Group B (p <= 0.021). Mean reconstruction time was significantly shorter in Group B than in Group A (1 min 43 s vs. 131 min 1 s; p < 0.001). Clinical information and radiation dose were not significantly different between the two groups.

2913,"Change in fibroblast growth factor 2 expression as an early phase radiotherapy-responsive marker in sequential biopsy samples from patients with cervical cancer during fractionated radiotherapy Background: The authors previously demonstrated that fibroblast growth factor 2 (FGF2) expression levels in tumor cells (FGF2-T) may be an indicator of the efficacy of radiotherapy in patients with cervical cancer (CC). In the current study, this finding was extended in newly enrolled patients and was investigated further in stromal FGF2 (FGF2-S) expression. Method(s): Sixty-nine patients with CC were recruited as a validation set for the immunohistochemical detection of FGF2-T from biopsy samples that were taken before (pretreatment) or 1 week after the initiation of radiotherapy (midtreatment). The authors also investigated the expression of FGF2 in tumor FGF2-S and investigated vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), and cluster of differentiation 31 (CD31) (also called platelet endothelial cell adhesion molecule) in these patients and in an additional 35 patients from a previous study. Result(s): FGF2 expression was detected in tumor cells from all patients and in stromal cells from 87% of patients. FGF2-T was significantly higher in midtreatment samples (P =.0002), and a high ratio of midtreatment/pretreatment FGF2-T was related significantly to a better prognosis (P =.025). Increased VEGF expression after the initiation of radiotherapy was related significantly to positive FGF2-S in pretreatment samples (P =.035); however, it was not related to prognosis or microvessel density detected by CD31 expression. Conclusion(s): Radiation causes a response in tumor cells and adjacent normal cells and changes the extracellular matrix environment. In this study, the authors confirmed their previous findings and demonstrated that changes in FGF2-T expression may be used as a marker to monitor the effectiveness of radiotherapy in patients with CC. These findings should improve patient selection for molecular targeted therapies, such as cytokine inhibitors, after standard-of-care treatment. © 2010 American Cancer Society.",Excluded
2966,"Intensity modulated radiotherapy with concurrent chemotherapy for larynx preservation of advanced resectable hypopharyngeal cancer BACKGROUND: To analyze the rate of larynx preservation in patients of locally advanced hypopharyngeal cancer treated with intensity modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) plus concurrent chemotherapy, and compare the results with patients treated with primary surgery., METHODS: Between January 2003 and November 2007, 14 patients were treated with primary surgery and 33 patients were treated with concurrent chemoradiotherapy (CCRT) using IMRT technique. Survival rate, larynx preservation rate were calculated with the Kaplan-Meier method. Multivariate analysis was conducted for significant prognostic factors with Cox-regression method., RESULTS: The median follow-up was 19.4 months for all patients, and 25.8 months for those alive. The 5-year overall survival rate was 33% and 44% for primary surgery and definitive CCRT, respectively (p = 0.788). The 5-year functional larynx-preservation survival after IMRT was 40%. Acute toxicities were common, but usually tolerable. The rates of treatment-related mucositis (> or = grade 2) and pharyngitis (> or = grade 3) were higher in the CCRT group. For multivariate analysis, treatment response and cricoid cartilage invasion strongly correlated with survival., CONCLUSIONS: IMRT plus concurrent chemotherapy may preserve the larynx without compromising survival.

3737,"Alveolar hemorrhage (AH) in ANCA-associated vasculitis: Characteristics and prognostic factors in 65 patients AH can be a mild or a life-threatening sign of ANCA-associated vasculitis, but its prognostic impact and specific characteristics have not been determined. To do so, we retrospectively analyzed AH episodes that occurred, between 1991 and 2010, in patients with ANCA-associated vasculitis entered in the FVSG database. Patients and Methods: We selected confirmed AH cases, as assessed by the presence of hemoptysis and ground-glass images on X-rays or CT scans and/or bloody bronchoalveolar lavage fluid. Renal insufficiency was defined as creatininemia >150 mmol/l. Severity criteria were: hypoxia, Hb decline >1 g/dl over 48 h after AH occurred and requiring mechanical ventilation. Result(s): For the 65 cases (35 men and 30 women) analyzed, their mean age at the 1stAH episode was 53 years. ANCA-associated vasculitis diagnoses were: 55% Wegener's granulomatosis (WG), 34% microscopic polyangiitis (MPA) and 9% Churg-Strauss syndrome (CSS). Pre-AH hemoptysis occurred in 41 (63%) patients: 39% the week preceding, 29.3% 2-4 weeks before and 19.5% >1 month prior to AH diagnosis, which led to ANCA-associated vasculitis diagnosis for 45 (69.2%) patients. Among 10 (15.4%) patients (4 WG, 4 MPA, 2 CSS) requiring mechanical ventilation, 4 had hemoptysis previously. Twenty-three (35%) patients were hypoxic and 23 (35%) had major Hb decreases; 36 (55%) had concomitant renal insufficiency (pulmo-renal syndrome): 18 WG (51% of all WG) and 18 MPA (81% of all MPA). Paucimmune glomerulonephritis was seen in 31/33 kidney biopsies. Intriguingly, no CSS patient had renal impairment when AH occurred. Treatments included a combination of corticosteroids and intravenous cyclophosphamide (CYC) for 55 (85%) patients; oral CYC was used in 5, methotrexate in 4 and plasma exchange in 7. Rituximab and remicade were prescribed to 1 patient each. Mean time between AH and treatment onset was 5.87 (range 0-60) days. Mean follow-up was 8.3 years (range 1 month-19 years). Follow-up information was not available for 8 patients. A total of 38 (58%) patients relapsed: 7 with AH and other organ involvement, 21 with non-AH manifestation(s) and 10 with AH alone. Three patients underwent kidney transplantation. The 13 (20%) deaths (6 WG and 7 MPA) were attributed to: septic shock for 4, lung cancer for 2, and 1 each of the following: bladder cancer, AH, sudden death, hemorrhagic stroke, ARDS due to misplaced nasogastric tube and probably drug-related (methotrexate). Although 9/13 patients with pulmo-renal syndrome died, no death resulted directly from the initial AH. Conclusion(s): These findings highlight the importance of recognizing premonitory hemoptysis as an early sign of AH in ANCA-associated vasculitides, since 63% of the cohort patients had bloody sputum before AH was diagnosed. Also, patients with AH and renal insufficiency have poorer survival prognoses. As demonstrated by the five-factor score, AH alone is not predictive poor prognosis; conversely, kidney involvement dictates a poor outcome.",Excluded
3653,"The role of endothelial nitric oxide synthase gene polymorphisms in patients with lung cancer Objectives: Lung cancer is a disease characterized by uncontrolled cell growth in the lung tissues. The most common causes of lung cancer include smoking, exposure to radon gas, asbestos, environmental pollutants as well as genetic factors. Nitric oxide (NO) has potential mutagenic and carcinogenic activity and may play an important role in lung cancer. Endothelial NO, synthesized from L-arginine by endothelial NO synthase (eNOS), inhibits apoptosis and promotes angiogenesis and tumor cell proliferation. The aim of the present study was to examine the possible relationship between eNOS gene intron 4 variable number of tandem repeat (VNTR) and exon 7-G894T (Glu298Asp) polymorphisms and lung cancer risk. Method(s): DNA was extracted from peripheral blood leukocytes of 107 lung cancer patients and 100 control subjects. Designated polymorphisms were identified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and/or restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP). Result(s): Our study showed that the frequencies of the b/b genotype and b allele of eNOS gene intron 4 VNTR polymorphism were significantly higher in lung cancer patients than in controls (P < 0.05). However, there was no significant association between eNOS gene G894T polymorphism and lung cancer risk (P > 0.05). Conclusion(s): These results suggest that the presence of the intron 4 VNTR* b allele and b/b genotype may be a genetic risk factor for development of lung cancer. Further larger-scale studies are needed to confirm these findings.Copyright © 2020 John Wiley & Sons Ltd",Excluded
2783,Role of the direct action of radiation in the mechanism of development of mammary gland tumors The role of the direct action of radiation in the genesis of mammary gland tumors in animals of both sexes was studied in experiments on noninbred albino rats. In two series of experiments the anterior or posterior half of the rat's body was irradiated with X rays in doses of 200 to 1000 rad. Tumors of the mammary glands appeared considerably earlier and were more numerous in the irradiated parts of the body of both females and males than in the unirradiated glands or in control animals. Females developed mammary gland tumors after exposure to smaller doses and in a higher proportion of cases than males.,Included
3120,"Tumorigenicity of human malignant lymphoblasts: comparative study with unmanipulated nude mice, antilymphocyte serum-treated nude mice, and X-irradiated nude mice The ability of unmanipulated, antilymphocyte serum (ALS)-treated, and X-irradiated nude BALB/c female mice (in their 13th backcross generation) to serve as hosts for 10 human lymphoblastoid cell lines as well as for peripheral blood lymphocytes from healthy humans was compared. The 10 lymphoma lines included 7 previously characterized and reported in the literature. Significant differences with respect to both latency period for tumor appearance and success rate for tumor transplantation were detected among the 3 experimental groups. The unmanipulated mice were poor recipients for lymphoma heterotranplants, and tumors were produced in only two instances. In contrast, 6 tumor lines were successfully transplanted in mice inoculated with ALS, and all 10 lines were successfully transplanted in X-irradiated recipients. Although tumors were readily produced in ALS-treated and X-irradiated mice, no gross or histologic evidence of focal or distant metastases was apparent. Human lymphoblastoid cells were recultured, essentially unchanged, from the heterotransplants from 6 of 7 tumors tested. Although the tumor line HT 1460, originally from a human lymphoma, was successfully transplanted in all 3 groups, only mouse cells were recultured. The use of X-irradiation, rather than ALS, to immunosuppress nude mice offers a more standardized method for heterotransplanting human tumor cell lines and permits ready comparisons between laboratories. Furthermore X-radiation permits transplantation and subsequent study of lymphoblastoid tumors that are otherwise difficult to successfully transplant in nude mice.",Included
2223,"G2 repair and chromosomal damage in lymphocytes from workers occupationally exposed to low-level ionizing radiation The effect of the G2 repair of chromosomal damage in lymphocytes from workers exposed to low levels of X- or gamma-rays was evaluated. Samples of peripheral blood were collected from 15 radiation workers, 20 subjects working in radiodiagnostics, and 30 healthy control donors. Chromosomal aberrations (CA) were evaluated by scoring the presence of chromatid and isochromatid breaks, dicentric and ring chromosomes in lymphocytes with/without 5 mM caffeine plus 3 mM-aminobenzamide (3-AB) treatment during G2. Our results showed that the mean value of basal aberrations in lymphocytes from exposed workers was higher than in control cells (p < 0.001). The chromosomal damage in G2, detected with caffeine plus 3-AB treatment was higher than the basal damage (untreated conditions), both in control and exposed populations (p < 0.05). In the exposed workers group, the mean value of chromosomal abnormalities in G2 was higher than in the control (p < 0.0001). No correlation was found between the frequency of chromosome type of aberrations (basal or in G2), and the absorbed dose. Nevertheless, significant correlation coefficients (p < 0.05) between absorbed dose and basal aberrations yield (r = 0.430) or in G2 (r = 0.448) were detected when chromatid breaks were included in the total aberrations yield. Under this latter condition no significant effect of age, years of employment or smoking habit on the chromosomal aberrations yield was detected. However, analysis of the relationship between basal aberrations yield and the efficiency of G2 repair mechanisms, defined as the percentage of chromosomal lesions repaired in G2, showed a significant correlation coefficient (r = -0.802; p < 0.001). These results suggest that in addition to the absorbed dose, the individual G2 repair efficiency may be another important factor affecting the chromosomal aberrations yield detected in workers exposed to low-level ionizing radiation.",Included
2876,"Post-operative stereotactic radiotherapy for the treatment of intracranial haemangiopericytoma: 'A Study of Dose and Outcome' Introduction: This study was performed to assess the relationship between tumour response and radiation dose in equivalent 2 Gy per fraction (EQD2). Method(s): A retrospective cohort analysis of 21 patients with a diagnosis of intracranial haemangiopericytoma between 2000 and 2013 was included in this study. A total of 39 lesions were analysed. The equivalent dose in 2 Gy per fraction was calculated by assigning an alpha-beta ratio of 12 Gy. A paired t-test compared dose (EQD2) and tumour response, and as the outcome was binary, a logistic regression analysis was performed. Result(s): In total, there were 14 cases of progression and 25 cases of non-progression. It was estimated that for a one unit increase in EQD2, the odds of non-progression were increased by a factor of 1.13 (P = 0.026). After adjusting for PTV volume, the estimated effect of EQD2 (min) on tumour response was stronger, with an estimated odds ratio of 1.36 for an increase of one unit and an odds ratio of 21.6 for an increase of 10 units (P = 0.015). The dose range varied with varying PTV volumes. Based on the logistic model, the probability of having non-progression is larger than 50% for EQ2Dmin doses larger than 30-40 Gy, in particular for volumes larger than 3.67 cm3. Conclusion(s): This study demonstrates that there is a relationship between dose (EQD2) and outcome. With increasing dose, the likelihood of regression is higher. When adjusted for PTV volume, the response appeared stronger. The dose varied significantly with changes in the size of the PTV.Copyright © 2018 The Authors.

According to their features, all pulmonary nodules identified underwent pathology, further CT evaluation or follow-up with low-dose CT., RESULTS: Apart from benign pleural findings (in 40% of subjects), 590 pulmonary nodules were identified. Eleven nodules underwent pathologic examination, which detected 5 malignant lesions, and 51 were evaluated with other CT techniques, in all cases demonstrating benign features. In follow-up low-dose CT scans, performed in the remaining 528 nodules, a minimal increase in size occurred in 4 cases only., CONCLUSIONS: Screening for clinically relevant pulmonary lesions in asymptomatic people with occupational exposure to asbestos may be useful if rigorous enrollment criteria are adopted.

3585,"Combined Effects of Three High-Energy Charged Particle Beams Important for Space Flight on Brain, Behavioral and Cognitive Endpoints in B6D2F1 Female and Male Mice The radiation environment in deep space includes the galactic cosmic radiation with different proportions of all naturally occurring ions from protons to uranium. Most experimental animal studies for assessing the biological effects of charged particles have involved acute dose delivery for single ions and/or fractionated exposure protocols. Here, we assessed the behavioral and cognitive performance of female and male C57BL/6J x DBA2/J F1 (B6D2F1) mice 2 months following rapidly delivered, sequential irradiation with protons (1 GeV, 60%), 16O (250 MeV/n, 20%), and 28Si (263 MeV/n, 20%) at 0, 25, 50, or 200 cGy at 4-6 months of age. Cortical BDNF, CD68, and MAP-2 levels were analyzed 3 months after irradiation or sham irradiation. During the dark period, male mice irradiated with 50 cGy showed higher activity levels in the home cage than sham-irradiated mice. Mice irradiated with 50 cGy also showed increased depressive behavior in the forced swim test. When cognitive performance was assessed, sham-irradiated mice of both sexes and mice irradiated with 25 cGy showed normal responses to object recognition and novel object exploration. However, object recognition was impaired in female and male mice irradiated with 50 or 200 cGy. For cortical levels of the neurotrophic factor BDNF and the marker of microglial activation CD68, there were sex x radiation interactions. In females, but not males, there were increased CD68 levels following irradiation. In males, but not females, there were reduced BDNF levels following irradiation. A significant positive correlation between BDNF and CD68 levels was observed, suggesting a role for activated microglia in the alterations in BDNF levels. Finally, sequential beam irradiation impacted the diversity and composition of the gut microbiome. These included dose-dependent impacts and alterations to the relative abundance of several gut genera, such as Butyricicoccus and Lachnospiraceae. Thus, exposure to rapidly delivered sequential proton, 16O ion, and 28Si ion irradiation significantly affects behavioral and cognitive performance, cortical levels of CD68 and BDNF in a sex-dependent fashion, and the gut microbiome.",Included
2841,"Dual-energy CT angiography for assessment of regional pulmonary perfusion in patients with chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension: Initial experience OBJECTIVE. This study assessed the utility of dual-energy pulmonary CT angiography (CTA) for noninvasive assessment of regional pulmonary perfusion in patients with chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension (CTEPH). Regional perfusion abnormalities were correlated with hemodynamic parameters and structural abnormalities on pulmonary CTA. SUBJECTS and methods. Twenty patients with CTEPH (11 men and nine women; mean age, 61.5 years) underwent pulmonary CTA with a dual-energy technique. Right heart catheterization data were available in 15 cases. Scan parameters were as follows: tube A, 140 kV (75 mA); tube B, 80 kV (300 mA); gantry rotation, 500 milliseconds; pitch, 0.5; and collimation, 14 x 1.2 mm. An iodine map was generated via three-material- decomposition and was scored for extent of hypoperfusion. Correlation was made with mosaic attenuation pattern, extent of vascular obstruction, and right heart hemodynamics. Iodine attenuation values were analyzed within completely occluded, partially occluded, and disease-free lobes. Results . A strong correlation existed between dual-energy CT-derived perfusion and mosaic attenuation pattern when both lobar (r > 0.6; n = 20; p < 0.006) and whole-lung scores were assessed (r = 0.77; n = 20; p < 0.001). There was no statistically significant correlation between dual-energy CT perfusion and vascular obstructive index, mean pulmonary artery pressure, or pulmonary vascular resistance (p > 0.08). Of 42 completely occluded lobes, 27 (64%) had demonstrable residual perfusion (mismatching), suggesting that blood supply was maintained via systemic collaterals. Conclusion. Dual-energy CT can offer a ""one-stop"" assessment of anatomy and perfusion in CTEPH. The additional information provided by dual-energy CT could have a future role in helping guide patient selection for thromboendarterectomy surgery. © American Roentgen Ray Society.",Excluded
2860,"A CT-Based Automated Algorithm for Airway Segmentation Using Freeze-and-Grow Propagation and Deep Learning Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a common lung disease, and quantitative CT-based bronchial phenotypes are of increasing interest as a means of exploring COPD sub-phenotypes, establishing disease progression, and evaluating intervention outcomes. Reliable, fully automated, and accurate segmentation of pulmonary airway trees is critical to such exploration. We present a novel approach of multi-parametric freeze-and-grow (FG) propagation which starts with a conservative segmentation parameter and captures finer details through iterative parameter relaxation. First, a CT intensity-based FG algorithm is developed and applied for airway tree segmentation. A more efficient version is produced using deep learning methods generating airway lumen likelihood maps from CT images, which are input to the FG algorithm. Both CT intensity- and deep learning-based algorithms are fully automated, and their performance, in terms of repeat scan reproducibility, accuracy, and leakages, is evaluated and compared with results from several state-of-the-art methods including an industry-standard one, where segmentation results were manually reviewed and corrected. Both new algorithms show a reproducibility of 95% or higher for total lung capacity (TLC) repeat CT scans. Experiments on TLC CT scans from different imaging sites at standard and low radiation dosages show that both new algorithms outperform the other methods in terms of leakages and branch-level accuracy. Considering the performance and execution times, the deep learning-based FG algorithm is a fully automated option for large multi-site studies.Copyright © 1982-2012 IEEE.",Excluded
3676,"Iterative image reconstruction techniques: Applications for cardiac CT Traditional limitations of cardiac CT are related to image noise, blooming artifacts from calcifications and stents, and radiation exposure. We evaluated whether these limitations can be ameliorated by the use of iterative reconstruction in image space (IRIS) instead of traditional filtered back projection (FBP) image reconstruction techniques. We compared image reconstruction with the use of IRIS with traditional FBP for their effect on image quality, noise, volume of heavy coronary artery calcifications, and stents as a measure of ""blooming"" artifacts, and radiation dose at cardiac CT. The radiation dose comparison was performed as a matched pair analysis, whereas all other comparisons were performed within the same group of patients. The subjective image quality of IRIS reconstructions was rated higher than FBP reconstructions. Image noise was lower with IRIS than with FBP. The volume of stents and heavy coronary artery calcifications measured lower in IRIS reconstructed series compared with FBP. Similar levels of image noise were achieved with 80/100 kVp of tube voltage with IRIS compared with 120 kVp and FBP, resulting in a 62% reduction in effective dose. Our preliminary experiences suggest that IRIS incrementally improves the CT evaluation of coronary arteries, especially in challenging scenarios. Substantial radiation reduction seems feasible without associated increases in image noise. Copyright © 2011 Society of Cardiovascular Computed Tomography. Published by Elsevier Inc.

3367,"Conservative treatment by irradiation of epidermoid cancers of the anal canal: prognostic factors of tumoral control and complications UNLABELLED: We analyzed in a retrospective series of patients treated by conservative irradiation for an epidermoid cancer of the anal canal (ECAC) the prognostic factors of locoregional control (LRC), survival, late severe complications (LSC), and sphincter conservation (SC)., METHODS AND MATERIALS: From 1976 until 1994, 118 patients presenting with an ECAC were conservatively treated (mean age, 65 years). According to the 1987 International Union Against Cancer (TNM) classification, they were: 19 T1, 70 T2, 22 T3, 7 T4, 94 N0, and 24 N1-3. The treatment started with external beam irradiation (EBI) (36 Gy in 3 weeks or 45 Gy in 5 weeks). Concomitant chemotherapy (5-fluorouracil and mitomycin C) was delivered to 31 patients. Two months later, a boost of 20 Gy was delivered by interstitial 192Ir brachytherapy to 101 patients and EBI in 5. Twelve other patients had an abdominoperineal resection (APR). The mean follow-up was 6 years., RESULTS: At 5 years the overall survival was 60%, and specific survival (SS) was 75%; it was 94% for T1, 79% for T2, 53% for T3, and 19% for T4. In multivariate analysis, tumor size (> or = 4 cm), node involvement, and no response to the EBI were factors of poor prognosis for SS. Thirty-two locoregional recurrences occurred of which 21 were local recurrences in the 106 patients treated by a conservative schedule. Only tumor size and response to the EBI were prognostic factors on multivariate analysis for local and LRC. A total of 17 patients presented with LSC (Grade 3, 16 patients; and Grade 4, 1 patient), which was treated by APR in 4 patients and colostomy in 11 (of which 7 were definitive). The only significant prognostic factor for LSC in the multivariate analysis was the total extrapolated response dose of irradiation. The definitive rate of SC after conservative treatment in cured patients was 100% for T1, 82% for T2, 58% for T3, and 100% for T4. Since 1989, improvements of the technique have allowed reduction of the LSC in maintaining the same local control., CONCLUSION: The results of this series are similar to those of the literature. The confirmation of pretherapeutic prognostic factors related to response to the treatment should allow us to adapt the therapeutic intensity for each case to obtain better tumor control, with as few sequelae as possible, to yield a better rate of SC.",Excluded

Indication for CT examination was staging of a known primary malignancy or suspected pulmonary malignancy. CT images were consecutively acquired at 5 mAs (ULD-CT) and 75 mAs (SD-CT) with 120 kV tube voltage (1 mm slice thickness). The standard of reference was determined by three experienced readers in consensus. CAD reading algorithms (pre-commercial CAD system, Philips, Netherlands: CAD-1; LungCARE, Siemens, Germany: CAD-2) were applied to the CT data sets., RESULTS: Consensus reading identified 253 nodules on SD-CT and ULD-CT. Nodules ranged in diameter between 2 and 41 mm (mean diameter 4.8 mm). Detection rates were recorded with 72 % and 62 % (CAD-1 vs. CAD-2) for SD-CT and with 73 % and 56 % for ULD-CT. Median false positive rates per patient were calculated with 6 and 5 (CAD-1 vs. CAD-2) for SD-CT and with 8 and 3 for ULD-CT. After separate statistical analysis of nodules with diameters of 5 mm and greater, the detection rates increased to 83 % and 61 % for SD-CT and to 89 % and 67 % for ULD-CT (CAD-1 vs. CAD-2). For both CAD systems there were no significant differences between the detection rates for standard and ultra-low-dose data sets (p > 0.05)., CONCLUSION: Dose reduction of the underlying CT scan did not significantly influence nodule detection performance of the tested CAD systems.",Excluded
3723,"Radiosurgery with flattening-filter-free techniques in the treatment of brain metastases : Plan comparison and early clinical evaluation BACKGROUND: Radiosurgical treatment of brain metastases is well established in daily clinical routine. Utilization of flattening-filter-free beams (FFF) may allow for more rapid delivery of treatment doses and improve clinical comfort. Hence, we compared plan quality and efficiency of radiosurgery in FFF mode to FF techniques., MATERIALS AND METHODS: Between November 2014 and June 2015, 21 consecutive patients with 25 brain metastases were treated with stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) in FFF mode. Brain metastases received dose-fractionation schedules of 1 x 20 Gy or 1 x 18 Gy, delivered to the conformally enclosing 80 % isodose. Three patients with critically localized or large (>3 cm) brain metastases were treated with 6 x 5 Gy. Plan quality and efficiency were evaluated by analyzing conformity, dose gradients, dose to healthy brain tissue, treatment delivery time, and number of monitor units. FFF plans were compared to those using the FF method, and early clinical outcome and toxicity were assessed., RESULTS: FFF mode resulted in significant reductions in beam-on time (p < 0.001) and mean brain dose (p = 0.001) relative to FF-mode comparison plans. Furthermore, significant improvements in dose gradients and sharper dose falloffs were found for SRS in FFF mode (-1.1 %, -29.6 %; p <= 0.003), but conformity was slightly superior in SRS in FF mode (-1.3 %; p = 0.001). With a median follow-up time of 5.1 months, 6-month overall survival was 63.3 %. Local control was observed in 24 of 25 brain metastases (96 %)., CONCLUSION: SRS in FFF mode is time efficient and provides similar plan quality with the opportunity of slightly reduced dose exposure to healthy brain tissue when compared to SRS in FF mode. Clinical outcomes appear promising and show only modest treatment-related toxicity.",Excluded
3160,"Adjuvant Radiation and Chemoradiation for High-Risk Salivary Gland Malignancies: A 20-Year Single Institution Experience Purpose/Objective(s): To report our institutional outcomes of patients with non-previously treated, high-risk salivary gland malignancies treated with surgery followed by adjuvant radiation (RT) and chemoradiation (CRT). Materials/Methods: From January 1997 to December 2017, 108 patients were treated with surgery, and adjuvant RT (n = 50) or CRT (n = 58) for high-risk pathologic features: perineural involvement (PNI), lymphovascular space invasion (LVSI), positive/close (<2mm) margin, high grade, extracapsular extension (ECE), or positive lymph nodes. Adjuvant RT was delivered in 2 Gy daily fractions, and adjuvant CRT was delivered for 4-6 alternating week cycles: the most common regimen, TFHX, consisted of 5 days paclitaxel (100 mg/m2 on d1), infusional 5-fluorouracil (600 mg/m2/d x 5d), hydroxyurea (500 mg PO BID), and 1.5 Gy twice daily irradiation followed by a 9-day break without treatment. The Kaplan-Meier method was used to estimate rates of locoregional control (LRC), disease-free survival (DFS), and overall survival (OS). Regression analyses were used to identify factors associated with LRC, DFS, and OS. Multivariable Cox Regression (MVA) was performed for known confounding risk factors, and factors associated with a trend to significance (p <0.20). Chi-Square was used to compare rates of toxicities between groups. Result(s): Median follow-up was 52 months (range: 3 - 226). The most common histologies included: Adenoid Cystic (n = 30), Mucoepidermoid (n = 20), and Salivary Duct Adenocarcinoma (n = 18). The most common location included the parotid (n = 73). The median RT dose was 66 Gy (range 43.2 - 74 Gy). The 5-year LRC was 88%, 5-year DFS was 57%, and 5-year OS was 78%. On MVA, LRC was not associated with any factors; DFS was associated with the size of the tumor (HR 2.0, p = 0.01), tumor location (HR 2.0, p = 0.01), and stage (HR 1.7, p = 0.02); and OS was associated with N stage (HR 2.3, p = 0.005), LVSI (HR 1.9, p = 0.012), ECE (HR 1.5, p = 0.032), and stage (HR 1.3, p = 0.05). CRT was not associated with improved LRC (HR 0.5, p = 0.34), DFS (HR 0.4, p = 0.44), or OS (HR: 0.46, p = 0.384). Since 87% of node positive patients were treated with adjuvant CRT compared to 13% with RT, therefore comparison was not possible. There was no difference in any acute or late grade 3+ toxicities, or parenteral nutrition between RT and CRT (p = 0.98, p = 0.85, and p = 0.83), respectively. There was one acute grade 5 toxicity in the RT group. Conclusion(s): To our knowledge, this is the largest single institution cohort of adjuvant CRT for high-risk salivary malignancies. Overall, adjuvant CRT doesn't enhance outcomes compared to adjuvant RT alone.

2951,"EUS-guided portal pressure gradient measurement with a simple novel device: a human pilot study Background and Aims Portal hypertension (PH) is a serious adverse event of liver cirrhosis. The hepatic venous pressure gradient or portal pressure gradient (PPG) accurately reflects the degree of PH and is the single best prognostic indicator in liver disease. This is usually obtained by interventional radiology (IR), although it is not routinely performed. Recently, we developed a simple novel technique for EUS-guided PPG measurement (PPGM). Our animal studies showed excellent correlation between EUS-PPGM and IR-PPGM. We present the first human pilot study of EUS-PPGM in patients with liver disease. Methods EUS-PPGM was performed by experienced endosonographers using a linear echoendoscope, a 25-gauge fine-needle aspiration needle, and a novel compact manometer. The portal vein and hepatic vein (or inferior vena cava) were targeted using a transgastric-transduodenal approach. Clinical parameters of PH were evaluated in each patient. Feasibility was defined as successful PPGM in each patient. Safety was based on adverse events captured in a postprocedural interview. Results Twenty-eight patients underwent EUS-PPGM with 100% technical success and no adverse events. PPG ranged from 1.5 to 19 mm Hg and had excellent correlation with clinical parameters of portal hypertension including the presence of varices (P = .0002), PH gastropathy (P = .007), and thrombocytopenia (P = .036). PPG was increased in patients with high clinical evidence of cirrhosis (P = .005). Conclusion This novel technique of EUS-PPGM using a 25-gauge needle and compact manometer is feasible and appears safe. Given the availability of EUS and the simplicity of the manometry setup, EUS-guided PPG may represent a promising breakthrough for procuring indispensable information in the management of patients with liver disease.Copyright © 2017",Excluded
2923,"[Study of nitroblue tetrazolium reduction by granulocytes in workers handling x-ray equipment] In 44 persons (25 women and 15 men), workers handling X-ray equipment in X-ray laboratories the ability was studied of nitroblue tetrazolium (NBT) reduction by neutrophils. The obtained results were compared with a control group. Besides that subgroups were isolated taking into account the sex of the studied subjects and duration of their work with X-ray equipment (over five years and below five years). In the workers handling X-ray equipment and in the isolated subgroups of women and men, the index of spontaneous NBT reduction turned out to be statistically significantly higher than that in the control group. In the group of studied workers the index of latex-stimulated NBT reduction was statistically significantly lower than that in the control group. Taking into account the duration of work with X-ray equipment in the subgroups of women and men working for over five years, the lowest index of phagocytes was noted. On the basis of the obtained results the following conclusions were formulated: 1. In workers handling X-ray equipment disturbances occur of peripheral blood neutrophil metabolism assessed in the NBT test. 2. Neutrophil phagocytic activity is weakened in persons working over five years with X-ray equipment.",Included
3428,"Response criteria in solid tumors (PERCIST/RECIST) and SUVmax in early-stage non-small cell lung cancer patients treated with stereotactic body radiotherapy Background: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the prognostic impact of Positron Emission Tomography Response Criteria in Solid Tumors (PERCIST) and Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) and of pre- and post-treatment maximum Standard Uptake Value (SUVmax) in regards to survival and tumor control for patients treated for early-stage non-small cell lung cancer (ES-NSCLC) with stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT). Method(s): This is a retrospective review of patients with ES-NSCLC treated at our institution using SBRT. Lobar, locoregional, and distant failures were evaluated based on PERCIST/RECIST and clinical course. Univariate analysis of the Kaplan-Meier curves for overall survival (OS), progression free survival (PFS), lobar control (LC), locoregional control (LRC), and distant control (DC) was conducted using the log-rank test. Pre- and post-treatment SUVmax were evaluated using cutoffs of <5 and >=5, <4 and >=4, and <3 and >=3. incrementSUVmax was also evaluated at various cutoffs. Cox regression analysis was conducted to evaluate survival outcomes based on age, gender, pre-treatment gross tumor volume (GTV), longest tumor dimension on imaging, and Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI). Result(s): This study included 95 patients (53 female, 42 male), median age 75. Lung SBRT was delivered in 3-5 fractions to a total of 48-60Gy, with a BEDalpha/beta=10Gy of at least 100Gy. Median OS and PFS from the end of SBRT was 15.4 and 11.9months, respectively. On univariate analysis, PERCIST/RECIST response correlated with PFS (p=0.039), LC (p=0.007), and LRC (p=0.015) but not OS (p=0.21) or DC (p=0.94). Pre-treatment SUVmax and post-treatment SUVmax with cutoff values of <5 and >=5, <4 and >=4, and <3 and >=3 did not predict for OS, PFS, LC, LRC, or DC. incrementSUVmax did not predict for OS, PFS, LC, LRC, or DC. On multivariate analysis, pre-treatment GTV >=30cm3 was significantly associated with worse survival outcomes when accounting for other confounding variables. Conclusion(s): PERCIST/RECIST response is associated with improved LC and PFS in patients treated for ES-NSCLC with SBRT. In contrast, pre- and post-treatment SUVmax is not predictive of disease control or survival.Copyright © 2018 The Author(s).",Excluded
3017,"Bone and joint modeling from 3D ankle MRI: Feasibility and comparisonwith radiographs and 2D MRI Purpose: To evaluate feasibility of creating segmented joint models (bone surface reconstructed x-ray) from 3D isotropic ankle MRI, assess various angular and joint space measurements on models and compare with corresponding radiographs and 2D MRI measurements, and determine differences in time consumption for performing the measurements. Material(s) and Method(s): Under HIPPAA compliance, consecutive series of 27 subjects with 3D ankle MRI isotropic data sets (0.65 mm voxel, fast spin echo, proton density weighted sequence) performed on 3 T scanners were used. Three subjects with incomplete x-ray series were excluded. Thus, a total of 24 subjects, 11 left and 13 right ankles, were included in the study, of which 8 were male and 16 females. Age ranged from 17 to 73 with mean of 46 years. Segmented joint models (bone surface reconstructed x-rays) were created on all isotropic MR data sets by one observer. Three readers independently performed various blinded angular and joint space measurements on the models, corresponding 2D MRI, and radiographs (XR) at study inception and 8 weeks later. Means and standard deviations were calculated. Paired t-tests were performed for each pair (XR vs. 2D, XR vs. 3D and 2D vs. 3D) within each parameter. P values less than 0.05 were considered as statistically significant and box plots were generated. Spearman correlation coefficient between measurements was performed to assess Inter-reader agreement. Interclass correlation and time difference analysis was performed. Result(s): 3D segmentation models resembling x-ray were successfully created in all cases within 20 (+/-5) minutes. Good agreement (ICC > 0.65) between all reader measurements was noted across all modalities with the exception of measuring the Talocural angle (3D, 2D, XR), talar pitch (3D), and tibibofibular clear space (2D), which showed weak to poor correlation. Time consumption was significantly greater (p < 0.05) on 2D vs 3D for all measurements except lateral clear space and medial tibiotalar concavity assessments. Time consumption was noted to be significantly greater (p < 0.05) on XR as compared to 3D for nearly half the measurements (5 of 11) for each reader. Conclusion(s): 3D bone and joint segmentation models resembling x-ray are feasible from isotropic ankle MRI data sets, which might lead to possibility of automated measurements by computer in future. While good correlation was noted between all readers, absolute measurement values were significantly different between modalities. The differences in absolute values is likely related to positioning variances (rotated x-ray mortise causing varied joint width, non-angle corrected 2D images, weight bearing vs non weight bearing, and the optimal positioning of reconstructed 3D image). Tighter collimation, a protocol variation, also limited evaluation in some cases by non-inclusion of reference points normally used with XR imaging and contributed to variance. Very good (ICC > 0.7) intrareader agreement was noted for most measurements with a few measurements showing moderate to good correlation (ICC > 0.5 to 0.65), Measurements on the 3D model of joint spaces was significantly faster when compared to 2D and generally faster than XR.",Excluded
3072,"A non-invasive citogenetic biomarker for colorectal neoplastia prediction INTRODUCTION: The aim of our study was to identify a feasible, non-invasive method to predict the presence of significant colorectal neoplastic lesions in patients undergoing colonoscopy. AIMS&METHODS: We included patients about to have colonoscopy in our departments between January 2011 and March 2012. Patients with known neoplastic disease, inflammatory bowel disease or prior radiation exposure were excluded. Blood samples for cytogenetic analysis using Cytogenetic-Bloked Micronucleus Assay (CBMN) technique were taken from patients. An expression of lymphocytic proliferation in specific stimulated cultures - the Nuclear Division Index (NDI) - was calculated trough this method. NDI represents a measure of general cytotoxicity. For statistics we used SPSS 11.0 software. RESULT(S): 94 patients were included. Their mean age was 55.1 years, men and women were equally represented, 47 each (50%). There were: 37 patients with normal colonoscopy, 4 patients with hyperplastic polyps, 30 patients with adenomas (from these 9 were advanced: size over 10mm, with high grade dysplasia or with a villous component larger than 25%), 23 patients with colorectal cancer. NDI was significantly lower in patients with adenomas and cancer than in patients with normal colonoscopy or hyperplastic polyps (AUC ROC = 0.637, p = 0.036). Secondly, NDI was also significantly lower in patients with advanced adenomas or cancer than in patients with normal colonoscopy, hyperplastic polyps or non-advanced adenomas (AUC ROC = 0.0677, p = 0.005). Finally, patients with colorectal cancer had a significantly lower NDI than patients with no colorectal cancer (AUC ROC = 0.655, p= 0.026). CONCLUSION(S): A lower Nuclear Division Index calculate by CBMN technique may predict the presence of significant colonic lesions in a population undergoing colonoscopy.",Excluded

When preparatory 5-beat scanning contained at least one RR interval longer than 800 ms, 5-beat diastolic scanning (R+800 ms protocol) was selected. When no RR interval longer than 800 ms was observed, 2-beat scanning starting at end-systolic phase (R+210 ms to R protocol) was chosen. In R+800 ms protocol, we manually terminated scanning when motion free real-time reconstruction image was confirmed. R+800 ms protocol was applied in 95% of the cases and required an average of 2 cardiac cycles, providing motion-free images in 91% of the patients.

2802,"Effect of Cisplatin on parotid gland function in concomitant radiochemotherapy PURPOSE: To determine the influence of concomitant radiochemotherapy with cisplatin on parotid gland tissue complication probability., METHODS AND MATERIALS: Patients treated with either radiotherapy (n = 61) or concomitant radiochemotherapy with cisplatin (n = 36) for head-and-neck cancer were prospectively evaluated. The dose and volume distributions of the parotid glands were noted in dose-volume histograms. Stimulated salivary flow rates were measured before, during the 2(nd) and 6(th) weeks and at 4 weeks and 6 months after the treatment. The data were fit using the normal tissue complication probability model of Lyman. Complication was defined as a reduction of the salivary flow rate to less than 25% of the pretreatment flow rate., RESULTS: The normal tissue complication probability model parameter TD(50) (the dose leading to a complication probability of 50%) was found to be 32.2 Gy at 4 weeks and 32.1 Gy at 6 months for concomitant radiochemotherapy and 41.1 Gy at 4 weeks and 39.6 Gy at 6 months for radiotherapy. The tolerated dose for concomitant radiochemotherapy was at least 7 to 8 Gy lower than for radiotherapy alone at TD(50)., CONCLUSIONS: In this study, the concomitant radiochemotherapy tended to cause a higher probability of parotid gland tissue damage. Advanced radiotherapy planning approaches such as intensity-modulated radiotherapy may be particularly important for parotid sparing in radiochemotherapy because of cisplatin-related increased radiosensitivity of glands.",Excluded

ULC sign-quantitative, reproducible, complements chest X ray in ER (DD dyspnea) & in-hospital evaluation (diuretic therapy) Aims Investigate dynamics of B line resolution and compare with findings on chest X ray Methods: Prospective observational cohort study done on patients requiring hemodialysis. Patients on hemodialysis with chest X ray underwent ultraosund examination of chest using 2-4 MHz microconvex probe. Parameters assessed were age, sex, pre & post dialysis B line score, absolute reduction in scores & comparison of B lines with chest X ray finding Results: 45 completed study protocol. Mean age was 50.7 years. 53.3% had significant reduction in post dialysis B line score <=3 (Pearson correlation coefficient of p < 0.05). All had initial B line score > 2. None had increase in B line after dialysis. 66.67 % patients had normal chest x ray & average pre & post dialysis B line score was 20.33 & 2.73 respectively. 33.3% had abnormal x ray, pre & post B line score was 40.93 and 29.93-no significant reduction in B line. Null hypothesis was rejected, that decrease in B lines prior to post dialysis with p value<0.05 occured in patients with fluid overload alone Conclusions Significant difference in pre & post dialysis B line score, suggest it represents extravascular lung water.

2796,"Pharmacokinetics and radiation dose of oxygen-15 labelled butanol in rCBF studies in humans In this positron emission tomography (PET) study in humans we determined the pharmacokinetics and radiation dose of oxygen-15 labelled butanol, a recently introduced tracer for regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF). This report includes a description of the automated preparation of 15O-butanol which allows repetitive activation studies, each 15 min apart. Dynamic rCBF studies were extended by prolonged measurements up to 15 min after injection over different organs such as brain, liver, kidneys and bladder. All measurements were done with a whole-body PET camera PC4096-15WB. Based on the pharmacokinetic data in 13 subjects the radiation doses to single organs were calculated according to MIRD pamphlet No. 11 and the effective dose defined by ICRP 60 as an indicator of radiation dose to the total body. The liver received the highest radiation dose of about 2.2 mGy per 1500 MBq of injected 15O-butanol, which is the typical amount of administered tracer in one rCBF measurement. The dose to the kidneys was 1.6 mGy, to the stomach 0.8 mGy, and to the brain 0.16 mGy. The effective dose was 0.54 mGy, which was similar to that of H2(15)O, but lower than the effective dose from C15O2 in amounts typically applied in human rCBF studies.",Excluded
2691,"Clinicopathological characteristics of patients with unexpected pathological N1 and N2 lung cancer Background: Although positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) seems to be able to provide accurate information of lymph nodes status in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients, we sometimes experience surgical cases with unexpected lymph nodes metastasis. The objective of this study is to demonstrate clinicopathological characteristics of patients with unexpected pathological (p) N1 and N2 NSCLC. Method(s): All patients with lung cancer underwent enhanced CT of the chest and PET/CT preoperatively for evaluating of lymph node status. Mediastinoscopy or EBUS-TBNA was not routinely performed. Unexpected pN1 and pN2 diseases were defined as surgical cases which were proved to have hilar or mediastinal lymph nodes metastasis postoperatively in spite of negative 18-fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose (FDG) uptake in hilar or mediastinal lymph nodes on preoperative PET/CT. We retrospectively reviewed clinical features of these patients and analyze predictive factors for these unexpected diseases. Result(s): Between January 2007 and December 2012, 533 patients with lung cancer underwent (surgical resection at our institution. Among them, we reviewed 182 patients who had available preoperative PET/CT data and underwent a curative-intent operation with systematic or selective lymph node dissection. One hundred fiftyone patients (83%) had lung cancer with expected lymph node status, whereas, 31 patients (17%) were found to have lung cancer with unexpected lymph nodes metastasis, consisting of 12 (39%) unexpected pN1 and 19 (61%) unexpected pN2 diseases. There were 16 men and 15 women with a median age of 67 years. Seventeen patients were current- or past- smokers, and 14 were neversmokers. Tumor size ranged from 12 to 52 mm, and pathological T factor was pT1a in 3, pT1b in 5, pT2a in 19, pT2b in 3, and pT3 in 1. Histological type of the primary tumor were adenocarcinoma in 28 (90%), squamous cell carcinoma in 2, and large cell carcinoma in 1. Among 28 adenocarcinomas, the most common predominant subtype was papillary (20 patients; 71%), followed by acinar (5 patients), solid with mucin, micropapillary, and invasive mucinous (one patient, respectively). Of these patients, 7 patients had micropapillary component in varying proportions in their tumors. EGFR gene mutation status was available in 22 patients, and of these, 12 patients (55%) had tumors with EGFR gene mutation, consisting of exon 19 deletion in 5, exon 21 point mutation in 5, and other minor mutation in 1. In univariate analysis, tumor size (> 3cm), pleural, and lymphatic invasion were significant predictive factors for unexpected pN1 and pN2 diseases. Only in 151 adenocarcinomas, papillary predomiant tumor and having micropapillary component were significant predictive factors for unexpected lymph node metastasis. Conclusion(s): We should take care that false-negative rate is relatively high on preoperative PET/CT for lymph node status in NSCLC. Histological findings of the primary tumor are often important because they can provide predictive information for lymph nodes status even if there is no FDG uptake in regional lymph nodes on preoperative PET/CT.

3058,"Radioprotective effects of exogenous glutathione against whole-body gamma-ray irradiation: age- and gender-related changes in malondialdehyde levels, superoxide dismutase and catalase activities in rat liver Age- and gender-related changes in malondialdehyde (MDA) levels, superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase (CAT) activities in rat livers exposed to different doses of whole-body gamma-ray radiation were determined. In addition, the effects of exogenous glutathione (GSH) against radiation injury in rat livers were investigated. We found that MDA levels have an age-associated increment and an increasing radiation dose-related elevation, although they decrease slightly in the 4 Gy group. The MDA levels in old rats were lower in males than in females, while those of young rats did not change. There were no observed age-related changes in SOD activities, although male rats had higher SOD activity than females. Female rats had the highest CAT activities in the 4 Gy group, while male rats had the highest CAT activities in the 6 Gy group. CAT activities in the 8 Gy group were lower than those of the 2 Gy group for each gender and age. While MDA levels were decreased and CAT activities increased by GSH, SOD activities remained unchanged. The results indicate that gamma-ray radiation affects gender- and age-dependent MDA levels, SOD and CAT activities. Administration of GSH appears to be a useful approach to reduce radiation injury by reducing MDA levels and increasing CAT activities.",Included
3310,"Some radiation effects on segregation in Drosophila Translocation induced in the immature oocyte, in meiotic prophase, affects division I orientation and segregation, the usual result being that the two halves of translocations are directed to opposite poles. Since interchange is usually (if not exclusively) between chromatids, this is to be expected from the creation of illegitimate conjunctions. Good agreement is obtained between patterns of segregations deduced from recovered half-translocation bearing exceptions and the kinds of disomic gametes expected as alternative recoveries from the same division I configurations. Inferences drawn from the study of compound-X females have been found to apply as well in the case of females of normal karyotype. Numerical errors occur predominantly, possibly exclusively, in division I. The rate of induced nondisjunction of specific chromosome pairs varies in relation to the structure of the entire complement, as required if radiation-induced nondisjunction is interchange dependent, but which would be unexpected if the mechanism involved effects on individual spindle fibers, chromosomes, or chromosomal bivalents.",Excluded

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Twenty-five patients with liver cirrhosis underwent 64-section multidetector CT. One hundred twenty kilovolt (peak) (kV[p]) with standard contrast material dose of 600 mg of iodine per kilogram (protocol A) and 80 kV(p) with low-contrast material dose of 450 mg of iodine per kilogram (protocol B) CT image sets were reconstructed by using FBP algorithm and that of using IR algorithm with a 60%/40% blend of IR-FBP reconstruction at 80-kV(p) image set (protocol C). Scans obtained during 3 hepatic phases were subjected to quantitative and qualitative analysis. RESULT(S): The mean radiation dose and the contrast medium dose were significantly lower under protocols B and C than under protocol A. In all hepatic phases, all signal-to-noise and contrast-to-noise ratios were greater under protocol C than under other protocols at all anatomic sites. Qualitative analysis showed that image noise and diagnostic acceptability were significantly higher under protocol C.

3296,"The first evidence for SLFN11 expression as an independent prognostic factor for patients with esophageal cancer after chemoradiotherapy Background: Schlafen 11 (SLFN11) was recently identified as a dominant determinant of sensitivity to DNA-targeting agents including platinum-based drugs. SLFN11 also reportedly enhances cellular radiosensitivity. In this study, we examined the prognostic value of SLFN11 expression in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) patients treated with definitive chemoradiotherapy (dCRT), including the platinum derivative nedaplatin. Method(s): Seventy-three patients with ESCC who received dCRT were examined. SLFN11 expression was analyzed in pre-dCRT biopsies using immunohistochemistry and evaluated using a histo-score (H-score). Correlation between the H-score and overall survival was analyzed. An H-score >= 51 was provisionally defined as indicating high SLFN11 expression. Viability assays were performed using previously established isogenic human cell lines differentially expressing SLFN11 to test the usefulness of SLFN11 as marker of response to the dCRT regimen. Result(s): High SLFN11 expression was independently associated with better prognosis in ESCC patients (hazard ratio = 0.295, 95% CI = 0.143-0.605, p = 0.001 for multivariate analysis). Kaplan-Meier survival curves showed that the prognostic value of high SLFN11 expression was most evident in patients at clinical stages II and III (p = 0.004). In in vitro study, SLFN11-proficient cells were highly sensitive to platinum derivatives compared to SLFN11-deficient cells. Conclusion(s): SLFN11 expression is an independent prognostic factor for ESCC patients treated with dCRT and a potential biomarker for treatment selection of ESCC. Examination of SLFN11 may be particularly useful for clinical Stage II-III patients who wish to choose dCRT (instead of surgery) to preserve esophageal function.Copyright © 2020, The Author(s).",Excluded

2809,"The effects of exposure to microgravity and reconditioning of the lumbar multifidus and anterolateral abdominal muscles: implications for people with LBP BACKGROUND CONTEXT: One of the primary changes in the neuromuscular system in response to microgravity is skeletal muscle atrophy, which occurs especially in muscles that maintain posture while being upright on Earth. Reduced size of paraspinal and abdominal muscles has been documented after spaceflight. Exercises are undertaken on the International Space Station (ISS) during and following space flight to remediate these effects. Understanding the adaptations which occur in trunk muscles in response to microgravity could inform the development of specific countermeasures, which may have applications for people with conditions on Earth such as low back pain (LBP). PURPOSE: The aim of this study was to examine the changes in muscle size and function of the lumbar multifidus (MF) and anterolateral abdominal muscles (1) in response to exposure to 6 months of microgravity on the ISS and (2) in response to a 15-day reconditioning program on Earth. DESIGN: Prospective longitudinal series. PATIENT SAMPLE: Data were collected from five astronauts who undertook seven long-duration missions on the ISS. OUTCOME MEASURES: For the MF muscle, measures included cross-sectional area (CSA) and linear measures to assess voluntary isometric contractions at vertebral levels L2 to L5. For the abdominal muscles, the thickness of the transversus abdominis (TrA), obliquus internus abdominis (IO) and obliquus externus abdominis (EO) muscles at rest and on contraction were measured. METHOD(S): Ultrasound imaging of trunk muscles was conducted at four timepoints (preflight, postflight, mid-reconditioning, and post reconditioning). Data were analyzed using multilevel linear models to estimate the change in muscle parameters of interest across three time periods. RESULT(S): Beta-coefficients (estimates of the expected change in the measure across the specified time period, adjusted for the baseline measurement) indicated that the CSA of the MF muscles decreased significantly at all lumbar vertebral levels (except L2) in response to exposure to microgravity (L3=12.6%; L4=6.1%, L5=10.3%; p<.001), and CSAs at L3-L5 vertebral levels increased in the reconditioning period (p<.001). The thickness of the TrA decreased by 34.1% (p<.017), IO decreased by 15.4% (p=.04), and the combination of anterolateral abdominal muscles decreased by 16.2% (p<.001) between pre- and postflight assessment and increased (TrA<0.008; combined p=.035) during the postreconditioning period. Results showed decreased contraction of the MF muscles at the L2 (from 12.8% to 3.4%; p=.007) and L3 (from 12.2% to 5%; p=.032) vertebral levels following exposure to microgravity which increased (L2, p=.046) after the postreconditioning period. Comparison with preflight measures indicated that there were no residual changes in muscle size and function after the postreconditioning period, apart from CSA of MF at L2, which remained 15.3% larger than preflight values (p<.001). CONCLUSION(S): In-flight exercise countermeasures mitigated, but did not completely prevent, changes in the size and function of the lumbar MF and anterolateral abdominal muscles. Many of the observed changes in size and control of the MF and abdominal muscles that occurred in response to prolonged exposure to microgravity paralleled those seen in people with LBP or exposed to prolonged bed rest on Earth. Daily individualized postflight reconditioning, which included both motor control training and weight-bearing exercises with an emphasis on retraining strength and endurance to re-establish normal postural alignment with respect to gravity, restored the decreased size and control of the MF (at the L3-L5 vertebral levels) and anterolateral abdominal muscles. Drawing parallels between changes which occur to the neuromuscular system in microgravity and which exercises best recover muscle size and function could help health professionals tailor improved interventions for terrestrial populations. Results suggested that the principles underpinning the exercises developed for astronauts following prolonged exposure to microg avity (emphasizing strength and endurance training to re-establish normal postural alignment and distribution of load with respect to gravity) can also be applied for people with chronic LBP, as the MF and anterolateral abdominal muscles were affected in similar ways in both populations. The results may also inform the development of new astronaut countermeasures targeting the MF and abdominal muscles.Copyright © 2020 Elsevier Inc.",Excluded
3095,"Sonographic diagnosis of intestinal anisakiasis presenting as small bowel obstruction BACKGROUND: To evaluate the accuracy of ultrasonography (US) in the diagnosis of intestinal anisakiasis presenting as small bowel obstruction., METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed the clinical features, US examinations, and CT scans of seven patients with intestinal anisakiasis presenting as small bowel obstruction. We compared the performances of US and CT in demonstrating peritoneal fluid, small bowel dilatation, and segmental edema of Kerckring's folds., RESULTS: All patients presented with a history of ingesting raw saltwater fish or squid less than 2 days prior to presentation at the emergency department and had significant levels of Anisakis-specific IgE. Both US and CT revealed small bowel obstruction, with dilated small bowel in all patients and accumulations of free peritoneal fluid in six patients. CT showed segmental wall thickening and luminal narrowing with submucosal edema distal to the distended small bowel; US did so in four patients., CONCLUSIONS: Although US was inferior to CT in demonstrating the segmental intestinal edema causing small bowel obstruction, it can be applied in suspected cases of intestinal anisakiasis presenting as small bowel obstruction, particularly where CT is unavailable or there are concerns about radiation exposure.

3686,"Association between SNPs in defined functional pathways and risk of early or late toxicity as well as individual radiosensitivity BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The aim of this study was to determine the impact of functional single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) pathways involved in the ROS pathway, DNA repair, or TGFB1 signaling on acute or late normal toxicity as well as individual radiosensitivity., MATERIALS AND METHODS: Patients receiving breast-conserving surgery and radiotherapy were examined either for erythema (n = 83), fibrosis (n = 123), or individual radiosensitivity (n = 123). The 17 SNPs analyzed are involved in the ROS pathway (GSTP1, SOD2, NQO1, NOS3, XDH), DNA repair (XRCC1, XRCC3, XRCC6, ERCC2, LIG4, ATM) or TGFB signaling (SKIL, EP300, APC, AXIN1, TGFB1). Associations with biological and clinical endpoints were studied for single SNPs but especially for combinations of SNPs assuming that a SNP is either beneficial or deleterious and needs to be weighted., RESULTS: With one exception, no significant association was seen between a single SNP and the three endpoints studied. No significant associations were also observed when applying a multi-SNP model assuming that each SNP was deleterious. In contrast, significant associations were obtained when SNPs were suggested to be either beneficial or deleterious. These associations increased, when each SNP was weighted individually. Detailed analysis revealed that both erythema and individual radiosensitivity especially depend on SNPs affecting DNA repair and TGFB1 signaling, while SNPs in ROS pathway were of minor importance., CONCLUSION: Functional pathways of SNPs may be used to form a risk score allowing to predict acute and late radiation-induced toxicity but also to unravel the underlying biological mechanisms.",Excluded
3708,"Assessing rheumatologists' attitudes and utilization of classification criteria for ankylosing spondylitis and axial spondyloarthritis: a global effort Objectives: This study aims to assess rheumatologists' perceptions, utilization patterns, and attitudes towards the modified New York (mNY) criteria for ankylosing spondylitis (AS) and Assessment of SpondyloArthritis International Society (ASAS) criteria for axial spondyloarthritis (axSpA). Method(s): Members of the national rheumatology societies in five countries (United States of America (USA), Canada, India, Turkey, and Brazil) were invited to participate in a survey containing questions regarding rheumatologists' familiarity, and use of AS and axSpA classification criteria in daily practice, perceived specificity of spondyloarthritis features in making the diagnosis, patterns of imaging tests performed in daily practice, and their opinion about the need for modification of current classification criteria. The responses were analyzed by gender, age, years in practice, as well as by country of practice. Descriptive statistics, t test, and chi-square test were used for comparison of groups. Result(s): Approximately 6% rheumatologists (478 out of 8021 professional association members) from five countries completed the survey. The country-specific response rates were Brazil 4%, USA 4.3%, India 11%, Canada 14%, and Turkey 29%, though the overall contributions from individual countries were USA 47%, India 14.9%, Brazil 13.8%, Turkey 12.8%, and Canada 8.8%. The mean age of respondents was 50 years (+/- 11.8), 31% were females and 90% spent majority (> 75%) of their time in clinical practice. The mNY and ASAS criteria were regularly used in clinical practice by 44 and 66% of responders, respectively. Those reporting ""always"" using ASAS criteria were more likely to be women (p = 0.006), and within 5 years of completing rheumatology training. Vast majority (74%) regarded Inflammatory Back Pain (IBP) as a specific feature for axSpA. Majority (50 and 60%, respectively) regarded uveitis and dactylitis as ""very specific"" features helping them make the diagnosis of axSpA, whereas heel enthesitis, peripheral inflammatory arthritis, and response to NSAIDs were considered ""somewhat specific"" by 50% of the responders. Less than half (47%) of the responders used the mNY grading for X-ray of SI joints. In the case of normal X-ray of SI joint, the use of MRI was more frequent than CT scan (83.6 vs. 10.9%) in assessing for sacroiliitis. If sacroiliitis was not seen on X-rays, the likelihood of ordering MRI was significantly higher among rheumatologists completing training within < 15 years versus > 25 years prior (90 vs. 75%, p = 0.007). Overall, 70% thought that ASAS criteria were adequately specific for clinical trials. However, 42% respondents still felt a need to modify ASAS classification criteria for axSpA. Also, 46% respondents felt that mNY criteria should be modified. Conclusion(s): In the absence of diagnostic criteria, majority of rheumatologists are using the classification criteria for diagnosis of axSpA. Though axSpA classification criteria are perceived to be specific for clinical trials, 40% rheumatologists feel the need to modify these criteria.Key Points* This study informs how rheumatologists in five countries spread over four different continents diagnose axSpA in clinical practice.* Since majority rheumatologists among survey respondents across the countries use ASAS criteria for diagnosis of axSpA, more specific criteria may be required to avoid overdiagnosis.* MRI is commonly used to rule out sacroiliitis in case of normal X-ray of sacroiliac joints.Copyright © 2020, International League of Associations for Rheumatology (ILAR).",Excluded
3454,"Tobacco smoke is phototoxic BACKGROUND: Both cigarette smoke and ultraviolet (UV) radiation are known to cause changes of the skin which can be regarded as premature ageing., OBJECTIVES: To assess the theory that the effects of these two exposures could be linked by a phototoxic action of cigarette smoke., METHODS: A photohaemolysis test was used, in which human erythrocytes were incubated with cigarette smoke condensate, followed by UV irradiation and measurement of exposure-dependent haemolysis., RESULTS: Cigarette smoke condensate was clearly phototoxic. Photohaemolysis depended on the concentration of the condensate and UV dose and was more pronounced after exposure to UVA-rich than UVB-rich radiation., CONCLUSIONS: Phototoxicity may be a mechanism by which cigarette smoking causes premature skin ageing. An enhancing effect on photocarcinogenesis has also to be considered.",Excluded
2591,"Comparison of lung lesion biopsies between low-dose CT-guided and conventional CT-guided techniques The low-dose computed tomography (CT) technique has been widely used because it decreases the potential risk of radiation exposure, as well as enabling low-dose CT-guided lung lesion biopsy. However, uncertainties remain regarding diagnostic accuracy, radiation dose, complication rate, and image quality. To compare the diagnostic accuracy, radiation dose, complication rate, and image quality of lung lesion biopsy between conventional CT-guided and low-dose CT-guided techniques. A total of 90 patients were prospectively enrolled and randomized into two groups (group A: 120 kv; 200 mA; thickness, 2.0 mm; pitch, 16 mm/rot; n = 44; group B: 120 kv;10 mA; thickness, 2.0 mm; pitch, 23 mm/rot; n = 46). Sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, positive predictive value (PPV), negative predictive value (NPV), radiation dose, image quality, and complication rate were compared. All variables between the two groups were analyzed using chi-square and Student's t tests. A P value of < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. The sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, positive predictive value (PPV), and negative predictive value (NPV) for diagnosing lung lesions were 96.88%, 100%, 97.5%, 100%, and 88.89% in group A, respectively. In group B, the values were 96.67%, 100%, 97.5%, 100%, and 90.91%, respectively (P > 0.05). The mean weighted CT dose index (CTDIw) and dose-length product (DLP) were 29.29 +/- 3.93 mGy and 211.74 +/- 37.89 mGy*cm in group A and 1.55 +/- 0.15 mGy and 10.98 +/- 1.56 mGy*cm in group B (P < 0.001). Image quality satisfied the need for a coaxial biopsy. Complications in group A and group B were observed in 27.28% and 23.91% of the patients, respectively (P > 0.05). Compared to conventional CT-guided biopsies, lung lesion biopsies guided by the low-dose CT biopsy protocol showed dramatically lower CTDIw and DLP levels. In contrast, the diagnostic yield of the procedures did not differ significantly, which is a recommended technique in certain populations.",Excluded
